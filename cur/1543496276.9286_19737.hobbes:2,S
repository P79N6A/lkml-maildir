Hmm, that's weird.

Not sure what happened.  When I used 2.1.x series, the parport code
worked great.  I was printing and writing to my zip at the same time,
and was in heaven.  That was on a different, older machine, of course,
but would that make a major difference?  It *shouldn't*, in my mind.
I've come to the end of my know-how on this one.  I don't know how to
trace what's happening when the job get's sent to the print queue, and
from thence to the printer via the Zip drive.

Exactly.  Procmail works wonders, of course, but still.  I don't even
know they're list address.  Not that I've looked very hard, but I didn't
know until yesterday that there *was* one.
Someone sent me some things to try configuring in the kernel, and I'm
going to double check that I've got those options enabled (yet again). 
Let you know what happens.
