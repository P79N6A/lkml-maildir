Bryan,
The one nobody has written in closed form as of to date.
Basically it is a DNE (does not exist).
The infrastructure is just now being laid into place now so, it will take
some time to code out the rest of the internals to allow standard UI
access.
I have my own suite of "private" tools, and they will not be released.
There are possible patent issues, and licensing problems.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
