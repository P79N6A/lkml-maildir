I think the perform backend for oprofile is the right way to go.
I'd even go further and say we should merge the perfom backend with
oprofile as the only user first, because a) the current perfom user
interface is a complete mess and can't be merged as-is and b) that
ensures the oprofile backend works perfectly and we can kill some
existing code in exchange.
