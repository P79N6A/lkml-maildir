I've looked through RFC-2394 quickly, but didn't found any mention about 
non-complient zstreams. I suppose they must be complient by default. 
Although I'm far not an expert in the area.

Anyway, in JFFS2 we may do that "hack" before calling pcompress(), so it 
isn't big problem.

I wonder, do we really want this?
Imagine we have 100 different compressors, and each is differently 
configurable. It may make cryptoAPI messy. May be it is better to stand 
that user must use deflate (and the other 99 compressors) directly if he 
wants something not standard/compliant?
