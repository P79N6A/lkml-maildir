Hello everyone!
I'm new to this mailinglist so please tellme if you think i'm "out of 
topoic".
I've have trouble with the following issue:
On two x86 machines, one AMD k62 and a Pentium the Bios dont wont to 
detect properly a 512 MB PC133 DIMM, the K62 based it dont detect it at 
all, and on the PII it detect it as a 128MB DIMM.
I suspect that's the BIOS that "sucks", not the HW, i supose that the HW 
is capable to deal with 512MB DIMM's, so my question to you 
"kernel-gurus", is there any posibility to configure the Linux kernel to 
bypass the BIOS and actually use my 512MB ?
Thanks!
/Benny
