The PacDigi core uses a "search count" register for that purpose,
but the buggy nature of the core required that it always be set
to "2 * ring_size" to ensure nothing got missed.
Here's some comments from the original ADMA driver.
Maybe something from here might help with the NV stuff, too.
       // There is a chance that the chip will skip over a CPB if a SERVICE interrupt
        // occurs while it's reading the CPB header.  This won't cause us to get
        // stuck anywhere, but it might slow down execution of the new CPB if
        // it has to wait for the next time we hit aGO.  So.. Dxxx/Dxxx suggest
        // that all we need to do is tell the chip to do two passes around the ring
        // from an aGO instead of one pass, so that it will find the "missed" CPB
        // on the second pass.  This isn't as bad as it first looks.
        //
        writew(channel->num_cpbs * 2, &adma_regs->cpb_search_count);
Or again, the NV stuff may be completely different (?).
