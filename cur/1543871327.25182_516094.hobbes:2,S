I will probably start working on it one day. Anyway some parts of what 
Dmitry described are already in the mainline since 2.6.20 - the parser 
code (and hid_device registration and initialization in general) is 
already there. Access to transport layers (USB/BT) is partly also there 
(see hid_open(), hid_close() and hidinput_input_event() callbacks in 
struct hid_device). So really the only one pending thing which is 
non-trivial would be creating an interface for registering the device 
driver for given VID/PID on the HID bus, and solving the fallback 
mechanism, i.e. assuring that everything works for drivers which are OK 
with generic hid and hid-input behavior.
I will happily accept such patches from you, if you do them. Otherwise I 
will start to work on it in a future anyway.
Thanks,
