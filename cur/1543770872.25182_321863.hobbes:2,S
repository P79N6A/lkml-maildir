No, *you're* the one misunderstanding.
Since *everything* is preemptible except a few known code paths whose
execution times determine the maximum possible latency from interrupt to
running the highest priority user process.
That's the determinism, no more, no less.  But some people inexplicably
think this thread is about providing deterministic hard RT performance
for some subset of system calls, or disk IO or something, none of which
have anything to do with PREEMPT_RT.
