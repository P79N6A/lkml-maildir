Hiall,
does someone have experience in porting some Kernel to Double-Harvard-Arch?
I don't think Lx was ever ported to such a kind of µP (please correct me!), 
all I found on the web were several ports to embedded, but still vNeumann-, 
or Single-Harvard µPs.
DH means, that the µprocessor (typically a DSP) has a seperated program 
memory, a seperate (X)Data memory and a seperate (Y)Data mem, so it can 
fetch two data adresses simultanely in one cycle via two physically 
independent mem ports. For DSPs, that's a common behaviour!
So, obviously one (me) will have to integrate two flavours of malloc() 
into the Kernel (vmallocX() and vmallocY()). Of course, i could leave this 
issue to a specialized (uC)glibc, but i think, it should be the job of the 
kernel to keep the oversight on memory issues...;)
Any ideas how to manage that trouble as "frictionless" as can?,
And¡
