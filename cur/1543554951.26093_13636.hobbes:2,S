They are distinguished by the PCI subsystem ID, which was truncated from the
list.
Note that Accton is really SMC.  They purchased part of SMC several years
ago, including the brand name.  The chip part of the old SMC is now named
SMsC, and they still make the EPIC Ethernet chip.
I do have a long list of subsystem IDs, but using multiple names for a
one-chip board with no design options is just confusing.  (Vs. the 21143
chip, which has at least 70 different driver-visible board design
variations.)
Bottom line: Yes, it's redundant.  But there was a reason.
