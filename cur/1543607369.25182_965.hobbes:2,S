As I wrote, version is 2.6.1
w83781d-isa-0290, there is _no_ modules with this name !
The needed modules are i2c-core, i2c-isa, i2c-proc, w83781d. They are loaded.

This is the clue. Without PnPBIOS enabled, the sensors work again. Thanks.
Alan, is there any known incompatiblity between PnPBIOS and the lm-sensors ?
