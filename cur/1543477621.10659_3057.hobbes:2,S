The mouse driver got merged with the PC keyboard driver because
they share the same hardware (the mouse is connected to the
keyboard controller). The mouse driver lost its ability to be
compiled as a module in the process.
Reconfigure with an 'Y' setting instead of 'M' for the mouse and
recompile your kernel.
