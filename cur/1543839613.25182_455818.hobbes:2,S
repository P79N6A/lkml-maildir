Thanks for consulting the networking maintainer before merging
this. :-/
What if some sockopt treats a negative length specially?
Maybe some setsockopt() doesn't care about the optlen pointer?
This toplevel code has no buisness interpreting the arguments when the
downcall and argument interpretation is by definition protocol
specific.  It also means we'll touch userspace twice for this value
which is really dumb.
The only nice part about this change is that it allows us to be lazy
about auditing the individual setsockopt() implementations.  I'd
rather fix the broken cases than add a patch which just assumes they
are broken and not worth fixing, and also imposes a convention for the
optlen argument.
No thanks.
And yes the coding style was totally unacceptable too.
