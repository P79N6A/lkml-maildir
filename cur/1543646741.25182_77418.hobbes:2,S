Hi,
 I have a kernel thread which did add_to_wait_queue()
to wait for an event. 
The event for which above thread is waiting occurs in
an interrupt handler that calls wake_up() to wake the
above thread. 
Now I am faced with a 'lost wakeup' problem, in which
the    
kernel thread checks whether event occured, he finds
it to be 'not-occured' but before calling
add_to_wait_queue(), interrupt handler detects that
the event has occured and calls wake_up().
My thread sleeps forever.
I know some new APIs are provided in recent 2.5
kernel, but how to avoid this in 2.4.18
please CC me 
Thanks
Amol
