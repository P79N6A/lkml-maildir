I do it the other way around - I've collected a number of .config files
(one for each machine) which includes everything the machine needs to
*boot*. Any additional features (LVM/DM, filesystems, iptables, ...)
ships as modules. Things which require a distinct order are placed into
/etc/modules (Debian's list of modules which need to be loaded in given
order), all the rest is done via alias/install lines in
modules.conf/modprobe.conf.
This is, you do keep a machine's local config in its initrd, I do keep
it on the machine itself.
MfG, JBG
