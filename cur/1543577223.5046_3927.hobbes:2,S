Excuse-me but, am I wrong or is this thread completely useless?
Since Alan Cox and I said that Solar Design has done a complete patch to
do the same, and since this patch is alvailble to everybody at
http://www.openwall.com
 in that way that everybody can download it and
have the choice to install it or not, do we still need to discuss over a
way to include a similar patch into the kernel?
