OK I've put my debugger hat and tried to go a little further. Here is an 
(I hope) interesting PCI tweaking session. For helping the readder here 
are the meaning of some value :
	1) 8086:248c : Intel Corp. 82801CAM ISA Bridge (LPC) (rev 02)
	2) 8086:2483 : the PCI ID for the i801 SMB bus
	3) 0xF2 the register offset used to enable the SBus in the ISA Bridge
	4) 0x20 = SMBBA = SMBbus base address in the i2c-i801.c file
root@pink-floyd:/home/valette# setpci -H1 -v -d 8086:248c 0xF2.W 
00:1f.0:f2 = 8409

root@pink-floyd:/home/valette# setpci -H1 -v -d 8086:2483 20.w
00:1f.3:20 = e801
So my deduction are :
	1) The trick for enabling the SMBbus is working,
	2) The configured base IO range register value is e801 leading to 
theoritically request the e800 -> e808 IO region and curiously not e810 
as requested described by the DTST...
Now I do not understand why it get something else as io port region no 
that the ACPI fix for bug 3049 remove the IORESOURCE_BUSY flags
