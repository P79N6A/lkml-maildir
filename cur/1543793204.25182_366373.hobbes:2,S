Let is be noted that this warning was fixed in a completely different
way in Linus' tree already. My patch is not meant for -stable either,
as it doesn't fix any real problem.

Without optimizations, gcc 3.3.6 keeps the variable although it won't
ever be used. With -O1 and above (including -Os) it drops the unused
variable.
