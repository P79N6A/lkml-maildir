The Coverity checker spotted the following off-by-10
in drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_sli.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int
lpfc_sli_process_unsol_iocb(struct lpfc_hba *phba, struct lpfc_sli_ring *pring,
                            struct lpfc_iocbq *saveq)
{
...
                        saveq->context3 = lpfc_sli_replace_hbqbuff(phba,
                                                irsp->un.ulpWord[15]);
...
<--  snip  -->
due to the following code in drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_hw.h:
<--  snip  -->
...
#define IOCB_WORD_SZ    8
...
typedef struct _IOCB {  /* IOCB structure */
...
                uint32_t ulpWord[IOCB_WORD_SZ - 2];     /* generic 6 'words' */
...
<--  snip  -->

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
