Forgive me if this question is very simple but i can't seem to find a
progrem that will show which processes are assigned to which processor on
my 2.2.6 SMP based system.  The verion of top that comes with HP-UX does
something like what i'm after.  It looks like:
Load averages: 0.11, 0.05, 0.05
124 processes: 122 sleeping, 2 running
Cpu states:
CPU   LOAD   USER   NICE    SYS   IDLE  BLOCK  SWAIT   INTR   SSYS
 0    0.22  20.1%   0.0%   0.4%  79.5%   0.0%   0.0%   0.0%   0.0%
 1    0.00  83.3%   0.0%   0.0%  16.7%   0.0%   0.0%   0.0%   0.0%
---   ----  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----  -----
avg   0.11  51.7%   0.0%   0.2%  48.1%   0.0%   0.0%   0.0%   0.0%
<clipped>
and then it'll tell you which processes are running on which cpu.  I just
upgraded my box to SMP and i am wanting to see what kind of utilization
i'm getting on the second proc.
Thanks,
