io_halfmem Time: 74.31  CPU: 93%  Major Faults: 204019  Minor Faults: 255284
Was writing number 4 of a 112Mb sized io_load file after 76 seconds
io_fullmem Time: 74.00  CPU: 94%  Major Faults: 204019  Minor Faults: 255289
Was writing number 2 of a 224Mb sized io_load file after 98 seconds

mem_load Time: 132.45  CPU: 56%  Major Faults: 204115  Minor Faults: 255234
As you can see, going from 2.5.34 to 2.5.36 has had a minor improvement in
response under memory loading, but a drop in response under IO load. The log
shows more was written by the IO load during benchmarking in 2.5.36 The values
are different from the original 2.5.34 results I posted as there was a problem
with the potential for loads overlapping, and doing the memory load before
others made for heavy swapping afterwards.
contest has been upgraded to v0.34 with numerous small changes and a few fixes.
