This piece is clearly wrong.  If the medium has physically been locked
(and the lock is managed by the cdrom layer) then we don't want to be
overriding it.  It should be up to the user or the tools to figure out
who has it open or mounted and take the appropriate action.

And this looks unnecessary.  Why does the device need to be started to
eject its medium?
