Yes, which is also the case with 8250_fourport.  8250_fourport is just
a probe module just like 8250_pnp or 8250_pci.

What problem are we talking about here again?  Sorry, I've completely lost

much to re-read.
Since you only appear to be the messenger, wouldn't it be far better to get
the person with the problem to report and respond rather than sitting in
