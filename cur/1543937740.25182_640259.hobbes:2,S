Thanks.  Done. :-)
And sorry about the premature mailing.  I have a set of scripts that
package everything up to send to test machines and it wasn't supposed
to trigger the "sendmail" phase to the distro list.  There are a few
build errors (as Ingo has noted) and I'm debugging an X86_64 !NUMA
problem that dies at network startup time.
But I'll add in all the suggestions from the "premature" reviews... :-)
Thanks again,
Mike
