Yes. I thought about it too.. I wanted to pass "block count" instead
of "byte count". Right now it does ..
	bh->b_size = 1 << inode->i_blkbits;
	call get_block();
First thing get_block() does is
	blocks = bh->b_size >> inode->i_blkbits;
All, the unnecessary shifting around for nothing :(
But, I ended up doing "byte count" just to avoid confusion of
asking in "blocks" getting back in "bytes".
I have no problem making b_size as "size_t" to handle 64-bit.
But again, if we are fiddling with buffer_head - may be its time
to look at alternative to "buffer_head" with the information exactly 
we need for getblock() ?
Thanks,
Badari
