Then write a simple program already. How hard is it to write a program
that does a sysconf() and returns (as ascii of course) just the
value of HZ? Then do some trivial calculation off of that.
HZ=$(gethz)
If your 500 was 5 seconds, do
TIME=$[HZ*5]
echo $TIME > /proc/sys/foo/bar/something_in_HZ
I mean, come on.
Then you include it in the default distro of choice so that
everybody can use it and there you are.
If someone doesn't have "gethz" then they can download it.
