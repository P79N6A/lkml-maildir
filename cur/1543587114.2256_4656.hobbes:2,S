For me 2.4.3 + aic7xxx-6.1.10 work fine. I just changed the default
bus settle delay from 15000ms to 5000m, and enabled APIC:
CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
The machine boots, devices are properly detected (unlike 6.1.8),
CDRW reads and burns fine, CDROM works (IDE-SCSI).
Intel C440GX+ UP, Adaptec AIC-7896/7, 2GB RAM, CDRW Sony CDU948 4x/8x
