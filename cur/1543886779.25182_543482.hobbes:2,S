If the special cpuset file 'memory_pressure_enabled' is turned on (echo
'1' to it) in the top cpuset, then the special cpuset file
'memory_pressure' that is in all cpusets provides a measure of the rate
of recent page allocation requests by tasks in each cpuset that were
not easily granted off the free list, requiring more aggressive kernel
effort to free up some pages to meet the request.
