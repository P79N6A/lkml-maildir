I'm hoping, but my dreams do not include shared memory over a network.
That's just way too slow.  It's been done a pile of times, every time
people say that the caching will make it fast enough and those people
are wrong every time.
People who think DSM is a good idea are the same people who think a
millisecond is OK for a cache miss (current cache miss times are well
under .0002 milliseconds).
