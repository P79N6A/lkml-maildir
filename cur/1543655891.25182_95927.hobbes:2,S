  Oh, you want to cap the retransmit time to 6 seconds so that
  TCP works (at least somehow) in a terribly lossy network ?
  Having that _low_ value at it isn't advisable in the general
  internet, but these modern mobile networks with paketized data
  are pain with dramatically varying latencies.  TCP works
  badly in such environments.  X.25 works better - to a degree..
  Changeing the value, and doing "make clean; make bzImage"
  should give you a kernel with it in.

  Possibly omitting "make clean" -- short-cutting it can be done
  by:  "rm net/ipv4/*.o"   I think..
