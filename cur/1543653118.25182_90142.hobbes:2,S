So, after some time in trying to exchange 2.4.20-rc2 files with the following 
files from 2.4.18 (and compile successfully)
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c
drivers/block/elevator.c
include/linux/elevator.h
those "pauses/stopps" are _GONE_!
I've also tested all this situations with totally different mashines. No 
changes, all behaves the same.
I am really afraid that no one else (seems so) noticed this but me! I cannot 
believe that?! :-(
It is a really serious "bug" I cannot live with. Doing that high disk i/o and 
even pings are ignored for the amount of time the stop occurs, is an 
absolutely inacceptable situation! *imho*
What do you think? :-)
ciao, Marc
