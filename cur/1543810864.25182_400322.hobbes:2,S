Have you taken a look at my logdev utility.  I usually use something like
the macro of this:
edprint("print my var %08lx", var);
which is defined as:
#ifdef CONFIG_LOGDEV
#  define LOGDEV(x,y...) logdev_##x(y)
#  define LOGTFPRINT(x...) do { if (atomic_read(&logdev_print_enabled)) \
     LOGDEV(print_time_func,__FUNCTION__,__LINE__,x); } while(0)
#  define _edprint(x,y...) do { \
    LOGTFPRINT(x "%s\n", y);} } while(0)
#  define edprint(x...) _edprint(x,"")
#else
#  define LOGTFPRINT(x...) do {} while(0)
#  define edprint(x...) do {} while(0)
#endif
This is just an idea of what is done.  This crazy macros are used because
I also have the logdev as a module, and if it is not compiled in, the
LOGTFPRINT turns into a spinlock holder  to safely load and unload
it.  I haven't used the module version in a few years, so I probably
should get rid of that feature.
Anyway, the atomic variable logdev_print_enabled is checked before doing
anything else, so it doesn't invade the code too much when disabled.  And
of course has no affect when not configured.
It also has ways to store everything binary.  The function name is saved
as a pointer and my read utility (which I don't know if I uploaded the
latest) does a mmap of /dev/mem to find the actual name. If you don't have
root, then it miss out, but the utility doesn't crash, it just doesn't
show the name.
