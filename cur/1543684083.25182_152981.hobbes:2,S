Greetings,
I have a laptop with the es1978 ALSA sound driver built into the kernel.  
When I go through a suspend / resume cycle using apm, the sound system 
does not recover and loud static comes from the speakers instead of 
music / voice / etc.  On boot, ALSA works just fine.
One solution appears to be building ALSA as modules and unloading / 
reloading them, after a suspend / resume cycle.  With 2.4.xx and the OSS 
drivers built in, this wasn't an issue.
Now that I've got them built as modules and have a 'sound' script in 
/etc/apm/events.d/ that does the loading and unloading I'm happy, but I 
figured I'd report the issue anyway.
Chris
