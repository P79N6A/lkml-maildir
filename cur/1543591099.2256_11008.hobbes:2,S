And then the IDE stuff is stiuoid to use the same major numbers for
in fact entierly different devices like CD-ROM and IDE disk drivers on
the same major... This makes it VERY uncomfortable to guarantee that
for example the sector size and driver read ahead are properties
tighted to the major number alone... In fact Linux is bundling 
read ahead with the major number only, in esp. inside the RAID drivers
which is entierly wrong! (see blksize_size array and read_ahead array).
And yes the RAID drivers are in particular *VERY* stiupid in
terms of major/minor number usage.
