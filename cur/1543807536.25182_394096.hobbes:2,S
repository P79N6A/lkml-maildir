Here is a second try at a documentation update. Any takers to fixup x86_64?

The current pci_map_sg API is a bit unclear what it is allowed
to modify in the passed scatterlist when coalescing entries.
Clarify the pci_map_sg API to prevent it from modifying
the page, offset, and length fields in the scatterlist.
