I've not found a much smaller set that isn't rootable, trivially DoSable
with published tools or leaves users with non-working hardware that got
pulled by Linus having a random pissy fit about pwc etc.
-ac is essentially base security fixes + working IDE locking + pwc +
fixes for the bugs everyone hit that needed fixing urgently. I consider
working locking on my storage essential because I like my data to still
be there.
-as is similar although it makes different choices about what matters.
Given 3 or 4 people it ought to be possible to make a much much tighter
patch set for this purpose.
