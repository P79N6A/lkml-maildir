Hello again,
you will love to hear that you can drop the above statement completely. After
digging deeper into the case I found out that it was caused by a dead switch.
So this is no -pre4 problem, but a hardware issue. The switch corrupted about
every 20th packet.
So I can tell nothing negative so far about -pre4 with 4 GB.
I'll try with 6 GB now.
Regards,
Stephan
