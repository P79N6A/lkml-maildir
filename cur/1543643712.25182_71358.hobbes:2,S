I think This is really taking up too many peoples personal time now,
So I'm going to purchase a Smart card reader and try to use that instead
(yes One I know Linux supports :-)).
I decided at the start if this week, to learn C, now I have a goal, I'm
going to get this camera working, if its the last thing I do (is its
possible at all).
Along the way I should gain a whole lot more knowledge into how the
kernel interacts with devices ( yes I know there is a lot to learn
before I start playing around with writing drivers, but this a target to
head for)
Once again I would like to thank everybody for the time and effort they
have put into this, Its really appreciated.
I anyone feels I'm just dropping this and wishes to get this cracked,
them I will be more than willing to carry on trying.
Cheers
Mark
