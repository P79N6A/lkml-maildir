Hi,
Now I know, how people handle their email, or for that matter, how
they don't. So, I give it a second try. I've cleaned up the sources
and put the file system on a web site, so hopefully this might work
for all now. It's at:
	
http://www.netcologne.de/~nc-dietscol/virtfs.tar.gz
This time I try to be more precise: I'm interested in technical
comments about the file system itself. So, if you know about linux
file system internals, I'd appreciate your comments.
If there are ways, to do things better or cleaner, I'd like to know
how and why.
For those, who haven't looked at it already: it's not a complete
implementation. I've done devices, named pipes, directories and
symlinks so far. Since I'm using it as a simple devfs, I have no
need for supporting regular files by now.
I know about Richard Gooch's devfs already. My file system is not as
full featured as his and will probably never be. I've just done it for
fun and education and, of course, because this one is "invented here" :-)
Regards, Olaf.
