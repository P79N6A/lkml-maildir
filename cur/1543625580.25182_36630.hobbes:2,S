IIRC there was an observation that spin_lock_irq seems to first disable
interrupts and then start spinning on the lock, which is why such a
situation could arise (even though the code in schedule doesn't appear to
explicitly disable interrupts).
However, in Mark's implementation, its only the first IPI that happens
under the runqueue lock, and that actually doesn't wait for the other CPUs
to receive the IPI. (The purpose of the first IPI was more a matter of
trying to improve accuracy by notifying the other threads as soon as
possible). So there shouldn't be a deadlock. The synchronization/wait
happens in the case of the second IPI (i.e. the smp_call_function), and by
that time the runqueue lock has been released, and cpus_allowed has been
updated.

Then the at least 2 CPU's would quickly become dead locked on the
synchronization IPI this patch sends at the end of the
suspend_other_threads
function call.
Interrupts shouldn't be turned off when grabbing the runqueue lock.  Its
also
a bad thing if they would happen to be off while calling into to schedule.
I think schedule was designed to be called only while interrupts are turned
on.  It BUG's if "in_interrupt" to enforce this.
