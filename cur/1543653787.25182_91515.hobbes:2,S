I looked at 2.5.47 (with a splattering of performance patches) using 
gcc 2.95.4 (Debian Woody), on a 16-way NUMA-Q, and did some kernel
compile testing. The times to do the tests were almost identical
(within error noise), but the kernel was indeed smaller

Wow ... that's quite some difference ;-)

I tried this, but it seemed to be the same as -fomit-frame-pointer
(on 2.95 at least).
Given that omitting the -fomit-frame-pointer makes a smaller kernel,
that's easier to debug, I'd say this is a good thing to do unless someone
can get *negative* benchmark results.
