VMS does this.  It at least used to have a great tendency to crash
itself, because it swapped out something that was called from a driver
that was called by the swapper -- resulting in deadlock.  You need
iron discipline for this to work right in all circumstances.
Second, it makes it quite hard to know what operations can cause a
task to sleep, since any reference to paged-out memory can require a
page-in and the associated schedule.  You almost need pointer
annotation in order for this to be safe.
