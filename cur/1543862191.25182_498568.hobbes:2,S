Subject: [PATCH] Kdump documentation update for 2.6.20: kexec-tools update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Mohan Kumar suggested making kexec-tools-testing.tar.gz a link
to the latest version. I have done this and this patch updates the
documentation accordingly.
This patch requires the documentation patch update that Vivek Goyal has
been circulating, and I believe is currently in mm. Feel free to fold it
into that change if it makes things easier for anyone.
