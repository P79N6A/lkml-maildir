Um... this one is highly suspect.  Myself and others have been doing a
lot of work on this driver lately, and have unloaded and reloaded it
hundreds and hundreds of times, and no one on the ALSA lists ever
reported this problem.  If this was real I really think we would have
heard of it a month ago.  The bug reporter did not even provide a
backtrace.
