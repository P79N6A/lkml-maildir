Yes, that's a possible simplification.

I don't think that would be much of a problem: ATMARP basically
aggregates information, but does very little in terms of actual
state transitions based on ATMARP/InARP messages. And IP doesn't
mind a bit of reordering anyway. (Reconnecting an SVC in the
middle of a TCP session may of course cause performance
glitches, but that would be more a problem of detaching the VC
in the first place, than anything happening when re-attaching.)
