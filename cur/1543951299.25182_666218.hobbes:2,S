That seems to be filling a similar need all right, though it looks
like a fancier (read: clunkier) solution.

Yes, I reallocate.  I do not currently register these with the
emergency pool, good spotting.  I intend to do all such reallocations
with GFP_MEMALLOC (out of tree deadlock-prevention allocation flag) and
rely on (out of tree) bio throttling to prevent the memalloc reserve
from being exhausted.  Hopefully these things will be in-tree in due
course.
Incidentally, the bio stack should make the bio throttling somewhat
more elegant, a nice circular effect.

Tell me about it :-)

I think you are right.  In fact, I thought about this for a couple of
years, always getting hung up at exactly that point.  When I stopped
trying to see the stack as a fixed size object with preassigned frames,
the rest fell into place.  One obvious problem with the pre-assigned
approach: you don't always know the path ahead of time that a bio
will take to a physical device.

Thankyou for your useful comments.  I do need to present a solution
complete with deadlock prevention.  I guess the bio code will end up
simpler there too, because with the memalloc anti-deadlock approach,
the array of bio mempools can go away.
