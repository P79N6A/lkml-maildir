Hi.
I try to do pulls reasonably often, but they always seem to be huge downloads 
- I'm sure they're orders of magnitude bigger than a simple patch would be. 
This leads me to ask, do they have to be so big? I'm on 256/64 ADSL at home, 
did a pull yesterday at work iirc, and yet the pull this morning has taken at 
least half an hour. Am I perhaps doing something wrong?
I'm using cogito .16-2 (ubuntu) and git 1.0.6.
Regards,
Nigel
