Strange, the screen brightness code wasn't modified in a while. What
was your latest kernel ?

Known problem, not sure if it's a timing io port access problem 
or something else. This will be properly resolved in the 2.5
version of the sonypi driver, when the screen brightness / battery
status etc will be directly accessed through the ACPI layer.

APM is screwed on most sony (and other recent, not  sony) laptops.
The only way to get this working is to use ACPI instead of APM 
(but since ACPI support is not and will not be complete in the 2.4
kernels, you will not have sleep/hibernation support etc).
That's why I added the battery query functions to the sonypi driver,
to work around buggy apm bioses and incomplete ACPI kernel support.
You can then hack the application inquiring the power status to
execute spicctrl instead of reading from /proc/apm.
