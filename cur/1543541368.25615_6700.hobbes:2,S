Subject: patch for md.c in 2.2.16

I don't know whether it is known that kernel 2.2.16 has a problem with
multiple devices. In the file md.c line 449
  md_blocksizes[minor] <<= FACTOR_SHIFT(FACTOR((md_dev+minor)));
has to be commented to get a running kernel. The error is the following one:
grow_buffers wants to much memory - kernel message:
  VFS: grow_buffers size = 16384
If I comment/erase line 449 then everything works fine.
