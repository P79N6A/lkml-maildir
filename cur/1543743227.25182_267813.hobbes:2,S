However. I have two machines very similar and one opses and one does not.
I wondered why. I've found out that if I turn whole netfilter to module and
disable:
CONFIG_NET_IPGRE=y
CONFIG_IP_MROUTE=y
CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V1=y
CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V2=y
Then problem seems to disappeare on both...
(I do not use iptables on any machine)
