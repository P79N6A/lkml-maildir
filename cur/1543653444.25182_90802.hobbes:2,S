I have a couple of ideas.  But, first, is it hard to reconstruct the 
memory map?  Will all 1GB systems have the same memory map?  Do you 
have documentation of the format?  I don't think that any of these 
qualify as the "right thing".  But, as hacks, they should keep me 
happy for a bit.
For now, I can write a quick script to fix it: 
--command-line="`memscript`"
Until it is working a --hack-mem option might be a good idea
Perhaps we could just save a copy off when the kernel loads for the 
first time. If we export it somewhere, the kexec executable can just 
copy it.  For now, we can just printk it and paste it into each 
version of kexec that we compile.
