Vojtech, a spiral (in the math sense) won't work because whatever 
continuos function you choose for the radius, you are going to skip 
integers when the radius grows (and duplicate them when it's small). Also, 
IIRC, fractions are enumerable because they're a mapping from two 
enumerable spaces (integers): F = F(I1, I2) = I1 / I2.
