Hi everyone,
Attached is a small patch (i386defconfig.patch) that change the default
configuration of CONFIG_I82365 and CONFIG_TCIC to more sane defaults.
Please review the patch and give me your comments on it, or apply it if
it is fine.
This patch is against Linux 2.3.40 and only change one file.
My reason for this patch is below:
-----
The recommended (in the help text) choice for CONFIG_I82365 is "Y", and
this makes sense as it's the most common PCMCIA bridge out there, but
the default setting is none the less "N". This patch change
arch/i386/defconfig to provide a default that match the sane choice.
The default setting for CONFIG_TCIC is "Y" and once again this goes
against both common sense (IMHO) and the recommendation of the help
file. So this patch also change the default setting for this
configuration option to be "N" by default.
The patch is self explanatory, but here is a short synopsis:
-----
CONFIG_I82365 - current default=N  new default=Y
CONFIG_TCIC  - current default=Y  new default=N
