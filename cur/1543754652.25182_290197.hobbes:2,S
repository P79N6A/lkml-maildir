You seem to have eliminated the mlock() failure as the cause of this
crash.  It should not have caused it anyway, but it *was* one
noticeable difference between your tests and mine.  Since
do_page_fault() appears in the backtrace, that is useful to know.
The other big difference is SMP.  What happens if you build a UP
kernel and run it on your SMP machine?
