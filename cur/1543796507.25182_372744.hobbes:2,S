Well, after finding a good doc on kmap_atomic on lwn.net, I think I
understood how to fix this. I grepped the whole kernel for kmap_atomic()
and found that KM_BIO_IRQ was only used by ntfs, which had a comment
stating that it was used to support highmem. So I thought we could share
the same type and rediffed the patch, and now the kernel builds.
Here is my proposal, I hope it's correct.
Cheers,
Willy
