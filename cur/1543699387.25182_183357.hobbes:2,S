Hmmm; I did a packet-trace on the 2.4.23 traffic for the same user
command, and it doesn't use READDIRPLUS at all (does 2.4.23 not support
NFS V3, or does it just use a different algorithm for reading
directories?), so maybe the server's just broken.  Gah...

No clue, but I suspect the answer is `sort of' (we don't have a real
sysadmin staff, but the people who take care of the servers are not
entirely clueless).  I'll check on it.
Thanks,
