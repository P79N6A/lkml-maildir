Hi all
	I am using  kernel 2.2.16.  I  need to use the following functions which of 
course are exported from a kernel 2.4.5.
	interruptible_sleep_on_timeout
	schedule_task
			These functions are not exported from 2.2.16. So which are the functions 
that is exported from 2.2.16 that we can be called instead of the above ones
regards
Blesson Paul
