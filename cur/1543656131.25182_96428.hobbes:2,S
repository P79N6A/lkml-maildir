There's another case where it matters, I guess one could look at it as
similar to the SMP case, but between CPU and device. Some devices have
producer indices in host memory which they update whenever it
receiving a packet. By putting that seperate from TX data structures
you avoid the CPU and the NIC fighting over cache lines.
Cheers,
