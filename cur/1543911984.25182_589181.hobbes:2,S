As far as I know, the grub 2.0 uses a modular implementation scheme.
That is, every OS loader (Multi-boot, Linux, FreeBSD etc), partition
table, file system is implemented as a module, and these modules can be
statically linked into the final image.
So I think the hibernation image loading can be implemented in grub 2.0
in a manageable way. :)
