Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: add nmi_exit to die_nmi

Playing with NMI watchdog on x86_64, I discovered that it didn't
do what I expected.  It always panic-ed, even when it didn't
happen from interrupt context.  This patch solves that
problem for me.  Also, in this case, do_exit() will be called
with interrupts disabled, I believe.  Would it be wise to also
call local_irq_enable() after nmi_exit()?
Currently, on x86_64, any NMI watchdog timeout will cause a panic
because the irq count will always be set to be in an interrupt
when do_exit() is called from die_nmi().  If we add nmi_exit() to 
the die_nmi() call (since the nmi will never exit "normally")
it seems to solve this problem.  The following small program
can be used to trigger the NMI watchdog to reproduce this:
  main ()
  {
        iopl(3);
        for (;;) asm("cli");
  }
