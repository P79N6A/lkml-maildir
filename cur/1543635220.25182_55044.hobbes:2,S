It would be nice if we could just map a set of user pages to a scatterlist.
Developers of mass transfer devices (video grabbers, dsp devices, sg and
many others) would just LOVE you for this ;-)
Block devices are the common case worth optimizing for, but character
devices just need to reimplement most of this, if they want the same 
optimizations. Some devices need mass transfers and are NOT blockdevices.
Linux supports only one class of them properly: NICs.
Please consider supporting them better for 2.5 in stuff similiar to BIOs
and DMA to/from user pages.
Thanks & Regards
