Very odd choice indeed. A lock prefix can only be used with some
instructions (see the list in any good Inetl manual) which performs
a read-modify-write on an operand n memory. Otherwise you get an exception
(number 6= undefined opcode AFAIR). So the preceding code is *guaranteed*
to generate an exception. MOV DI,DI with eventually a segment override,
address size, data size, and/or repeat prefix is ok, since these prefixes
won't affect the instruction. But prefix decoding is extremely slow on
recent intel processors, and gratuitous prefixes should never be used.

OR actually affects all flags (including the carry which may be important
in some cases).

Actually the Intel nop is coded as xchg [e]ax,[e]ax since the 8088. On the
386, it took exactly the same time as xchg [e]ax with any other register
and was slow. From the 486 or Pentium, I can't remember, the NOP is
optimized and much faster than the actual xchg instructions. 
And it the case of GCC at least, the compiler generates assembly source
and it is the assembler that generates the optimized nops whnever the
compiler inserts an align directive. Basically, one byte nop is the
standard 0x90 Intel opcode. Larger ones are often a variation on the lea
instructions as you can see from the following excerpt from binutils
(2.9.1.0.13 but it shoud not matter infile gas/config/tc-i386.c), which
shows how the code actually plays with different possible encodings of the
same instruction:
  /* Various efficient no-op patterns for aligning code labels.  */
  /* Note: Don't try to assemble the instructions in the comments. */
  /*       0L and 0w are not legal */
  static const char f32_1[] =
    {0x90};                                     /* nop                  */
  static const char f32_2[] =
    {0x89,0xf6};                                /* movl %esi,%esi       */
  static const char f32_3[] =
    {0x8d,0x76,0x00};                           /* leal 0(%esi),%esi    */
  static const char f32_4[] =
    {0x8d,0x74,0x26,0x00};                      /* leal 0(%esi,1),%esi  */
  static const char f32_5[] =
    {0x90,                                      /* nop                  */
     0x8d,0x74,0x26,0x00};                      /* leal 0(%esi,1),%esi  */
[snipped]

    {0x8d,0xb4,0x26,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,        /* leal 0L(%esi,1),%esi */
     0x8d,0xbc,0x27,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00};       /* leal 0L(%edi,1),%edi */
  static const char f32_15[] =
    {0xeb,0x0d,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,        /* jmp .+15; lotsa nops */
     0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90,0x90};
	
Up to 14 bytes, at most 2 instructions are needed. 15 bytes and more
are better handled by a jump.
