I've seen very similiar behaviour on my machine, a K6-2 with the Diamond
Fireport 40 card. My system crashes down whenever I do anything massive. I
get errors like:
Jan 24 15:16:21 rincewind kernel: EXT2-fs error (device 08:0e):
ext2_free_blocks
: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 1094978592, count = 1 
Jan 24 15:16:21 rincewind kernel: EXT2-fs error (device 08:0e):
ext2_free_blocks
: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 3768038038, count = 1 
...
Jan 24 15:18:54 rincewind kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Jan 24 15:18:54 rincewind kernel: 08:0d: rw=0, want=433866169,
limit=1822704 
...
Jan 24 15:18:54 rincewind kernel: EXT2-fs error (device 08:0e):
ext2_add_entry: 
bad entry in directory #321615: rec_len % 4 != 0 - offset=0,
inode=286331153, re
c_len=4369, name_len=3 
All this eventually ends in an Opps. Unfortunately, it appears that
syslogd is the process that it is Opps'ing in, at least some of the time.
I have yet to really trap one of these. I was just about to check the pre9
patch to see what changed when I saw your message. I went straight from
pre6 to pre9, so I don't know when the bad behavior comes in.
