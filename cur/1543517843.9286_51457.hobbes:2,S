Hi!
AFAICS the CODA credentials cache (coda_cache.c) could be used almost without
any changes by >all< filesystems with long-taking permisson lookup.
Example: ACL support for ext2!
So I suggest the following changes:
1. renaming coda_cache -> creds_cache
2. moving it from fs/coda/ to fs/
3. inserting a struct coda_cache* pointer into struct inode
  - VFS' default is a NULL pointer
  - coda, ext2-acl (more to follow) let it point into a struct coda_cache
    inside inode->u.i_coda resp. inode->u.i_ext2
4. maybe: moving the creds cache lookup to the VFS altogether
Would a patch be accepted? Against which versions?
