Dear Sir/Madam,
Due to reasons i would explain in greater detail later,i am in search of a sincere partner to assist me in securing and investing the sum of USD25,000.000 (twenty five million  dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve.
I am the only surviving child of late Mr Sekou Janeh ,a liberian diamond merchant.my father became rich from his extensive investment in  diamond trade both in Liberia and in Sierra leone.he was assasinated in Monrovia,Liberia in November 2000 by gunmen of the Charles Taylor-led dictatorship while on a business trip. Before his death, my father who foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and property based on his line of business and the insecurity of the region, decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family after the death of my father; yet the liberia government and it's loyalists are bent on hunting us down because of my father's vast financial reserve.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 20% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds or 25% share of a possible joint venture business.
if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed information. if you do not accept my offer,in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
ANDREW JANEH.
