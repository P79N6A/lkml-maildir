This makes P4 Xeon to report correct i686 platform. Without this, 
all those people that think its ld.so automatically picks i686 libs
are wrong...
The original code takes u_platform for coyping ELF_PLATFORM, but
also supposes it is the top of stack. This changes when we have
siblings:
    if(smp_num_siblings > 1)
        u_platform = u_platform - ((current->pid % 64) << 7);
Later:
        NEW_AUX_ENT(0, AT_PLATFORM, (elf_addr_t)(unsigned long) u_platform);
that on HT cpus is broken, isn't it ?
This separates the two things, stack top and u_platform. It could be
even cleaner, with something like
stack_top = p;
if (k_platform)
	sz = strlen(k_platform)+1
	u_platform = stack_top - sz
	__copy_to_user(...)
	stack_top -= sz
else
	u_platform = NULL
...
if(smp_num_siblings > 1)
        stack_top = stack_top - ((current->pid % 64) << 7);
...
if (u_platform)
	NEW_AUX_ENT(...)
But I have not tested it. Current patch below.
