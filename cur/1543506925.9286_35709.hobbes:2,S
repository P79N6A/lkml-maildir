I'm informed that there's a patch to allow my kernel to see the 
correct size of my new DPTA-353750 drive.
It ought to have 72680 cylinders, but is clocking over at 64k, and 
only reporting 7144, with a resulting capacity of 3.4 Gb.
I've tried telling fdisk that it's actually 5056 cylinders by 230 heads,
creating an ext2 partition  but I then get 'unchecked file system 
messages' when I finally try to mount the partion.
I've spent several hours scouring for the potential patch, but I've 
failed to find it (which is probably based on my own ignorance). 
Can somebody point me to it?
TIA.
