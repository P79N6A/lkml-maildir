Yes. Gcc inlining is a total piece of sh*t.
Gcc doesn't inline enough when we ask it to, and inlines too damn 
aggressively when we don't. It seems to almost totally ignore the inline 
hint. 
Oh, well. The best option tends to be
 - mark things "noinline" just to make sure gcc doesn't screw up.
 - make "inline" mean "must_inline".
 - maybe add a new "maybe_inline" to be the "inline" hint that gcc uses.
because quite frankly, depending on gcc to do the right thing is not 
working out.
