How is this supposed to work. Xorg was not designed to be security
barrier. So... your exploited evolution, but evolution is now
UNTRUSTED, so you can't do anything interesting... right?
Wrong. evolution can ask Xorg to simulate "rm -rf /" keypresses, and
send them to your shell in another window...
