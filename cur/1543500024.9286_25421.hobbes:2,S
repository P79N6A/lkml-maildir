I'm puzzled. There are two chips on it, but all I can read on it is:
UT6264SC-70L, 6918 (first chip, 70ns -> memory chip?)
AT007, 9631PX005 (second chip, seems the controller)
The web shows up nothing for these numbers. OTOH, i noticed that there
*is* a dipswitch (4 switches) on it, connected  directly into the second
chip.
Also, I checked Artec's homesite, and they DO talk about IRQ settings, so
i guess i might have been totally wrong there.
