That patch is 64 bit only and also I'm not sure what EBDA looks like to
a Xen domU (I expect it doesn't exist). I'll give it a go but I'm not
hopeful.

Correct, the area between 640k and 1M is just normal memory for a Xen
guest and the memory map reflects that so page tables and other stuff
get allocated in regions which would be magic data structures on native.
