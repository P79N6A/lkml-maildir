I thought about using rbtrees. But I decided it was overkill. Beyond
the 4k limit of the current proc code, currently that's limited to
~256 entries per block/char and will be limited to about ~1024 each
for the foreseeable future. It's only walked on driver init/exit and
when catting said proc file (where O(n) is unavoidable). In other
words, worst case we're talking less than a millisecond at
boot/shutdown.
