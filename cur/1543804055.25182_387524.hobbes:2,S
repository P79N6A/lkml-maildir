Hi!

On thinkpad X32: I selected
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI=y
# CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_FAKE is not set
# CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ is not set
# CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_IBM is not set
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI=y
# CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI_IBM is not set
# CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_CPCI is not set
# CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_SHPC is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_IBM=y
Recompiled, rebooted with machine out of dock. /sys/bus/pci/slots/ is
empty. I then inserted machine into dock, and locked it:
root@amd:/sys/bus/pci/slots# echo dock > /proc/acpi/ibm/dock
root@amd:/sys/bus/pci/slots# ls
root@amd:/sys/bus/pci/slots#
...still empty. What am I doing wrong?
