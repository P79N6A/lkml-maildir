So you're saying that a task can only be in a single system-wide container.
My patch provides multiple potentially-independent ways of dividing up
the tasks on the system - if the "container" is the set of all
divisions that the process is in, what's an appropriate term for the
sub-units?

That assumes the viewpoint that your terminology is "correct" and
other people's needs "fixing". :-)
But as I've said I'm not particularly wedded to the term "container"
if that really turned out to be what's blocking acceptance from people
like Andrew or Linus. Do you have a suggestion for a better name? To
me, "process container" seems like the ideal name, since it's an
abstraction that "contains" processes and associates them with some
(subsystem-provided) state.
