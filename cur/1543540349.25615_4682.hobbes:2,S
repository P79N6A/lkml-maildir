I agree, this belongs in user space. I'm currently rewriting the PPC stuff 
for the input layer (just checked in to the BK repository) and I have kept 
the emulation (converted to an separate mouse-like input_dev, called via a 
hook in keybdev.c) for 2.4, but I plan to get rid of it during 2.5.
Hmm, actually your keylink idea sounds neat, maybe I should create a pseudo 
keyboard event device instead of a pseudo mouse device and have gpm 
evaluate this pseudo device. Have to find out how I can make that work with 
XF4 _without_ gpm.
Franz.
