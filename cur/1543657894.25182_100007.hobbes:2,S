  There is no logical fallacy as I was talking in terms of consumer 
level piracy.

  Don't get me wrong I understand this.  This is why I feel most games 
would tend toward an escrow license if they tended toward any sort of 
open license.  You could claim this as a trend by citing  Doom, and 
Quake.   Few games have a shelf life much beyond 6 months.
  That said I've never bought a game because it had a certain feature.  
(Other than the ability to pause and issue orders in RTS.)

  I think you are taking this discussion a bit more serious than me.  
I'm just theorizing where trends are (or could be) heading.  Of course 
my livelihood has always been dependent on selling hardware;-)
