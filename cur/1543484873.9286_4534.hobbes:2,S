My 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.2-pre2_arca-1.gz
 just alloc a
dynamic number of pages for the buffer hash in function of the total
memory of the machines.
On 128Mbyte of ram it uses 32 pages.
On 256Mbyte of ram it uses 64 pages.
At bootup you'll see a printk that tell you how many pages are used for
the buffer hash.
I also just enlarged the page cache hash table from 11 bit to 13 bit.
I think that we should try to use RB-trees for both the buffer and the
cache because such things are very dynamic in size.
