Just to see if my understanding is on track ...
Today's scatterlists already handle entries with a size greater than
MMU pagelength, even on x86, right?  We have seen it in iSCSI driver
testing, though it is not the usual case.  crypto/digests.c:update()
function was recently patched to handle the case and properly kmap()
the additional memory represented by the sg entry.
So, on regular x86 this is a matter of convenience/timing, and the
page assignments will tend toward, but not always be, random 1-page
entries as the system is used.
