I think for every HID report id, you should be able to attach a special

Actually creating a HID bus is not a bad idea. And even Bluetooth
provides the VID/PID values for every device. So the transports only
have to give these to the HID parser. Then every driver on top of the
common HID layer can do whatever they think is best and they don't have
to care about the actual transport. Actually the report descriptor is a
good example which both (USB and Bluetooth) have in common, but they are
retrieved totally different. The driver on-top of HID doesn't need to
have to deal with that.
However separating out the transports and creating a common HID layer
should be done sooner than later. Once we have done that, we can talk
about the HID simple driver or device specific drivers on top of the
common HID layer.
