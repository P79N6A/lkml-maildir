Will do soon. But now I don't have it at hand, it's on my home system 
unfortunately and I would like to finish some other minor things there
as well. I mean basically the macro games showing that somebody didn't
understand C pointer semantics found at places like:
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ALI15X3
extern unsigned int pci_init_ali15x3(struct pci_dev *, const char *);
...
#define PCI_ALI15X3	&pci_init_ali15x3
#else
...
#define PCI_ALI15X3	NULL
#endif
This should rather look like:
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ALI15X3
extern unsigned int pci_init_ali15x3(struct pci_dev *);
#else
#define pci_init_ali15x3	NULL
#endif
And be replaces entierly by register_chipset(...) blah blah or
therlike ;-) as well as module initialization lists.

Well the lists are needed for quirk handling in the ide-pci.c code.
But if it turns out to be possible - I'm all for it.
