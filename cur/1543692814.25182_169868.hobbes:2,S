Hi,
same here with es1371. but when i look into the -test6 patch, i see this:
------------------
  config SND_ENS1371
         tristate "(Creative) Ensoniq AudioPCI 1371/1373"
-       depends on SND && SOUND_GAMEPORT
+       depends on SND && GAMEPORT
         help
           Say 'Y' or 'M' to include support for Ensoniq AudioPCI 
ES1371\ and
           Sound Blaster PCI 64 or 128 soundcards.
------------------
but i did not notice that SND_ENS1371 ever depended from SOUND_GAMEPORT.
(i have no joystick, but still listen to music :-))
so, a rather trivial fix would be:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/snd/Kconfig.nogameport.patch
(for SND_ENS1371 only, but should probably do for similiar cards)
oh, as Malte (TM) pointed out, this is tested for i386 only :-)
cheers,
Christian.
