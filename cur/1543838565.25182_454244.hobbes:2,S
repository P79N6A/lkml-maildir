I guess you have way too many TLAs here...

"Enable Comprehensive System Accounting Job Accounting" . Ouch. So you
do not even know how to use those accronyms correctly.
I guess you should invent some better naming.

...long text and it *still* does not tell me what it is good for.

We normally drop back compatibility at merge...
