I think it wasn't kept because it would have had to get rewritten anyway, 
and the only user (modutils) was going away. Most of the information was 
only there because the old system needed it, and the new system didn't 
need it, so nobody bothered. Also, the modern style is to avoid 
special-purpose syscalls and use sysfs. It probably wouldn't be too hard 
to get the information exported through the sysfs interface if you ask 
Rusty and explain exactly what you need.
(Note that you can get module symbols by searching /proc/kallsyms for 
<tab>[<name>], so that part is available from the kernel, although not 
efficiently if you have a lot of symbols that you aren't interested in)
