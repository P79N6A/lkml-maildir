... IMHO this change harms the readability of the code.

Here, for example, the code is /purposefully/ enumerating all the task
states, probably it makes sense to explicitly enumerate the exit states
as well?

Regarding above two changes -- agreed, we want to catch /any/ exiting task
state, so (!p->exit_state) is /correct/, but still, enumerating those
explicitly helps readability. And although it's unlikely, in the future,
we may have an exit_state value for which we may _not_ want to complain
(WARN or BUG) in this code. So I'd still vote to keep the code explicit
like it was ...
