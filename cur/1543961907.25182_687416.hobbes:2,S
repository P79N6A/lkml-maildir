You don't have to, because this simply is no infrastructure bug...
Don't blame Kconfig for abusing select for something it was never 
intendend for. There is no bug!
In this case there is now a mixture of depends and selects on leds. First 
decide whether led support should be automatically included or the driver 
is only available when led support is enabled. In the first case it's 
probably better to create LEDS_SUPPORT, which then again selects 
everything necessary.
bye, Roman
