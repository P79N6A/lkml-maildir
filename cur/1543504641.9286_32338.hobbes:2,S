Yeah, spotted this a long time ago. I worked on the bridging stuff
for a while (Even bought 802.1d for the purpose....) But it seemed
to me that nobody was/is using the bridging functionality anymore.
It's still tagged experimental (Alan Cox told me: "because nobody
is/was maintaining it.") Also, with linux moving to SMP systems the
bridging functionality is going to die out probably. It's pretty hard,
maybe impossible, to get the forwarding database (AVL tree)
locking right without making performance suck. An AVL tree which
needs updating on every packet received will probably not scale
to a lot of processors. So you'd either need a new data structure,
or.... Ideas?
