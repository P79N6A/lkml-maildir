Well... please dont start a flame war :(
Back to your SYN_SENT problem, I suppose the remote IP is known, so you 
probably could post here the result of a tcdpump ?
tcpdump -p -n -s 1600 host IP_of_problematic_peer -c 500
Most probably remote peer received too many attempts from you, and a 
anti DOS mechanism is droping all SYN packets.
Ah well... I remember now that you mentioned tcp_sack setting had an 
effect, so forget the "Most probably..." and give some tcpdump traces :)
