Thanks Roland.  I've never really understood this stuff, and I just
copied this cargo-cultishly.
I'm not quite sure what you're suggesting here though.  Do you mean one of:
NOTE_KERNELCAP_BEGIN(1, 1)
NOTE_KERNELCAP(0, "nosegneg")
NOTE_KERNELCAP_END
or
NOTE_KERNELCAP_BEGIN(1, 2)
NOTE_KERNELCAP(1, "nosegneg")
NOTE_KERNELCAP_END
is the correct thing to use?

Are you saying that one of the corrected forms might cause old glibcs to
crash, or just ignore nosegneg?
