Maybe I missed the discussion, but why might "depmod -a" result
in every module getting installed?  This didn't happen under any
of the 2.4.0-testX releases that I recall, and I ran every one of
those and the prerelease without this "trouble".  Gotta say, the
screen output from running "lsmod" with everything installed is
pretty darned impressive :-).  Another oddity that someone else
already reported: the ipv6 module shows a reference count of -1.
Yes, I'm running modutils-2.4.1, and I get the same results with
modutils-2.3.15.
