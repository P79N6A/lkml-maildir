What brand/model drive is this?
It is possible to get very weird errors if you have unsupported media in
the drive and some drives don't like certain media types.  Sometimes a
firmware update on the drive fixes it although it usually requires
windows (or sometimes dos) to install the update (or linux will do if
the drive is a plextor).
