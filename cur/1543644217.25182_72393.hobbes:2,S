You can read that into it sure, how about reading the other side.
Also Pete, you know me better than to paint me into that corner so bogus.
Treat the students as professionals, as they will be soon enough.
Sheesh, fund a university project to get the fresh young minds to derive
the future fabric.  Regardless if the students are paid or offerred
scholarships in return, would it not be a "WIN-WIN" for "ALL"?
Now the cherry on top comes to a few or many who are super talented, and
find they have a career resulting from the work.

So if this is true, where is the sign up list for contracts based on
deliverables?

No but a legal binding contract of deliverables will bring those along who
rise to the challenge, correct?

Erm, more likely the basic infrastucture for permiting in-band device
recovery and communication pathways back to the requesting thread or
application above is what appears to be lacking, but then again I could be
wrong.

Nice, so they do a great dog-n-pony show?
