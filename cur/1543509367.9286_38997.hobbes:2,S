I just fell over this problem again, this time in 2.2.12. Haven't had it
for two weeks or so, but I must admit that I don't run ping continuously
anymore to keep the link up. Instead, I do the following loop:
while netstat -n | grep tcp | grep -v 127.0.0; do
	ping -c 5 $PEER_IP
	sleep 4
done
This has revealed some other aspect of the problem, although I guess
they are *but differnt manifestations:
- ping times over an otherwise unused link go from 40ms to 1040ms, ie.
up by exactly one second, the ping interval.
- the above loop almost always shows many connections of the from
tcp	1	0	...	CLOSE_WAIT
that won't go away for minutes. ping -f will not flush these! Example
real-world output follows:
tcp        1      0 129.70.37.20:2143       129.70.4.50:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        1      0 129.70.37.20:2142       129.70.4.50:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        1      0 129.70.37.20:2141       129.70.4.50:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        1      0 129.70.37.20:2140       129.70.4.50:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        1      0 129.70.37.20:2139       129.70.4.50:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        1      0 129.70.37.20:2138       129.70.4.50:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        1      0 129.70.37.20:2137       129.70.4.50:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        1      0 129.70.37.20:2136       129.70.4.50:8080       
CLOSE_WAIT
tcp        0      1 129.70.37.20:2132       128.32.18.166:80       
SYN_SENT
So this indicates that the same problem as described by David is present
here, with a queue length of one.
