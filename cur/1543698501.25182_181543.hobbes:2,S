| I think you just need your application to encrypt data where needed.
| Or to read/write to an encrypted file-system which always encrypts.
| You really don't want policy inside the kernel.
| 
| Let's say you decided to ignore me and do it anyway. The file-systems
| are a bunch of inodes. Every time you want to read or write one, something
| has to decide if it's encrypted and, if it is, how to encrypt or
| decrypt it. Even the length of the required read or write becomes
| dependent upon the type of encryption being used. Surely you don't
| want to use an algorithm where a N-byte string gets encoded into a
| N-byte string because to do so gives away the length, from which

| So, you need variable-length inodes --- what a mess. The result
| would be one of the slowest file-systems you could devise.
|

| on the media work. Making something that could be either/or,

Well said. This isn't the way to do it as you say, although you could
add an O_CRYPTO flag to creat() if you really wanted to.
Crypto in the program is definitely the better solution.
