It's already supported via the new pam_loginuid module.  Also the
loginuid is not a part of the task proper, rather the audit context.
It's treated in a manner similar to security contexts which are handled
via /proc interfaces.  Having said that, I wouldn't be opposed to a
patch that promotes it to compatible syscall as you mentioned below
(thanks for the details) if it turns out to be useful.  Got a patch?
