Confirmed. This commit works. STR still ok.
But now, a different problem. STD "almost" ok. Suspend-to-disk hangs
after counting to 100%. Power-cycle and boot ok able to resume. ...
Again, this is another problem with/without your latest patch. Another
issue is with iwl4965 not able to attach to my hidden AP. Will try to
bisect soon.
Thanks for the patch.
Jeff.
