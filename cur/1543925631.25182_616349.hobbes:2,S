The problem is not what the distributions ship, the problem is simply 
that problems with distribution packaged software should be reported 
to the distribution, not upstream.
And for becoming at least marginally on-topic again:
Assuming your "stable base systems" contains the Linux kernel, how would
you prevent users from reporting bugs in their ancient kernels [1] here?

You should rephrase it:
Closed-source operating systems offer less software both available for 
convenient installation and supported by the vendor of the operating 
system.
Noone forces any users to install the software their distribution 
supports - people can (and sometimes do) install other software or
other versions of some software when they need it.
But the good thing about open source software is that when you believe 
your ideas are better than what current distributions do you can 
implement your ideas and create your own distribution. Then time will 
tell whether you were right or wrong.

[1] keep in mind that when using a 6 months old kernel, this kernel
    differs by more than one million lines of code (sic) from the 
    current kernel
