Hello Andrew,
testing 2.6.0-test1-mm1 right now. Everything's been _really_ good so far.
I've been using 2.5.72-mm1 before since it's out without a problem.
make -j 16 bzImage + xmms + moving a term window like mad never makes Xmms skip
which is really good. Term window freezes for few seconds after moving it like mad for ~7/8 sec
(not a realy day to day typical workload ! :) And it comes back to normal almost as soon as i stop
moving the Eterm window.
I also have a Xinerama setup and no pb so far when moving like mad the Eterm windows from one
screen to the other or moving Eterm like mad wile overlapping the 2 screens.
Box is Dell WS 530 MT SMP 512 Mo , 15K RPM SCSI disk (AIC7xxx, 0 TCQ), Nvidia GeForce 256 AGP  NV10DDR + 
Nvidia NV6 Vanta LT PCI
boot option is : kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.5.72-mm1 root=/dev/sda2 console=tty1 console=ttyS1,9600n8 elevator=as noirqbalance
Box is running postfix, Mozilla, Opera, NFS server, gnomeICU, etc.. and all is running fine ( subjective
opinion ;)
Congrats to all kernel hackers :)
Thanks,
Philippe
