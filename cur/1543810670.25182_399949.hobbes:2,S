Btw, having looked at that bug report some more, I have to say that this 
particular one seems to be of the "HAL is just being an ass about things" 
variety.
Why the hell anybody would care about what the command transport type is, 
when all that matters is that it's a block device, I don't understand. The 
exact details of what kind of block device it is are totally secondary, 
and shouldn't affect basic desktop behaviour.
The patch (to HAL) that the bugzilla entry points to doesn't seem to make 
anything better either. It just adds _another_ magic case-statement. 
Instead, it should just default to doing something sane.
