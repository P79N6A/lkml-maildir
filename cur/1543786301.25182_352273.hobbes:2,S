It is here :o)
In one terminal:
  'while [ 1 ]; do sensors; done', 
in another:
  'while [ 1 ]; do rmmod w83627hf; sleep 1; modprobe w83627hf; sleep 1; done'
Is fine in -rc2, but same test on 2.6.14-rc1 locked up with a busy error 
a couple times on rmmod during ~ 30 seconds or so, something has changed 
and improved.
