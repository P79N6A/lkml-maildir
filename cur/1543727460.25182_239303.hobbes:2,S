Two things that may be of interest: 1, I do run the -mm kernels too as 
I figure the more they get excersized, the quicker some fault will be 
found.  This included the whole chain of 2.6.7's & 2.6.8-rc1/2-mm1/2.  
In this case all hell broke loose here while everyone was at the 
conventions.  Not your fault, but I was "grabbing a life jacket" 
here.
2. with the patch Linus sent, top is now showing 383 megs of free ram.  
I suspect that without that patch, it might well be less than 15 megs 
after a many (10+) hour uptime.  So this patch is definitely more 
aggressive in its memory housekeeping than without it.
And everything is on except the acpi stuffs, which has ever interested 
me here.  I do use apm, but only for shutdowns & rtc in utc.
PREEMPT, 4k stacks, page tables in high mem, frame pointers etc, its 
all on right now. So far, I haven't even heard the first shoe 
drop. :)
