I believe we agree that you do not see it. :)

And reading glasses won't help someone who can't read.  Is your above set of 
statements somehow meant to imply that a debugger cannot help someone who CAN 
code?  (Logic.  Logic is good here.)
A similar argument would be "Nobody should own an oven.  If you can't cook 
you'll just make a mess."

It's a tool.  Does anybody really disagree about its nature?
The main purpose of tools is to save time.  No tool is a substitute for 
skill.  it's possible to do everything a debugger can do via printks out to 
the printer and having a stack of source code printouts, and doing all your 
debugging in pencil.  It's also possible to pound in a nail with a rock, if 
you think hammers are for sissys.
If you stop and think about it, it's sort of like amish kernel development, 
isn't it?  (Hey, we've already got the community barn raising aspect.  Now 
let's outlaw certain construction techniques! :)

I had the source code to the contractor-produce pile of cruft I worked with 
under OS/2.  I could even read some of it, given enough time.  Trust me, a 
source debugger REALLY helped find the differences between what it was 
supposed to be doing and what it was actually doing.  (Or more accurately, 
the few places where what it was supposed to be doing and what it was doing 
matched up...)

I think we agree.  So why recommend against debuggers if they save time and 
effort while producing patches of equal quality?

Sure, blame the tool. :)

So the state of the running kernel is more observablee without a kernel 
debugger than with one?
Debugging means, basically, "this sucker is doing something I didn't expect 
it to, and I have to find out what".  A debugger is a tool with which to 
examine running code.  It doesn't help you write the stuff, just examine it.  
The proper tool for the proper job...
The unix philosophy has always been to give people enough rope to shoot 
themselves in the foot with.  I'm just wondering why the exception.  (Yes I 
read the "bastard" speech.  It seemed to boil down to a crude sturgeon's law 
filter because Linus was once again being overwhelmed by crap patches (an 
annual event around here).  Making less than perfect coders code blind won't 
increase the quality of anything, but might decrease the quanity.  I suppose 
that's one way of addressing the problem, but doesn't seem to me to be an 
optimal solution...)
