Interesting.  I _had_ lumped you into the "unhappy with BK" camp that has
become so vocal on l-k these days.  My apologies.  I do find it sort of sad
that you (or anyone) actually have to defend your BK usage to others.
I'm personally a "do what you want and let others do what they want as
long as it doesn't interfere with me" kind of person, but it seems that
lots of people here have the opinion that they know what is better for
everyone else, and have no problem telling the list over an over about it.
Probably time to fork a linux-code-repository mailing list and have everyone
spend their time over there instead of rehashing BK flamewars and/or BK
replacement here every week.
Cheers, Andreas
