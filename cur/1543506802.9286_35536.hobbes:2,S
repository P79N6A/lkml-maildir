To delete the route use the ip utility from Alexey. First look at the
"real" route table entry using 'ip route' which effectively does an 'ip
route show table 254'.

You should not. The ip utility and friends provide full policy based
routing which is more powerfull than Cisco's IOS. There are many things
now possible within the routing structure that were never possible under
2.0.

Really you do need to look at the 'ip route' output and you will see the
difference.

That would be preferred. One of the main problems I have with the
FreeS/Wan model is the insistance on controlling the route table which is
an incorrect way of approaching the problem. The Linux 2.1 and higher
kernels have a MUCH broader control mechanism for routing structures
including policy based routing. So I can issue commands to the effect of:
This user on this machine from this ip address on this port will be
encrypted and sent to destination x while the other port from the same
user on the same machine with the same ip address will be transported to
destination y unencrypted. 
That is not possible today with FreeS/Wan due to the route manipulations
among other hacks.
