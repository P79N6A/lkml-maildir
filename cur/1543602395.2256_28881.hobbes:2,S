The above are the "old" kernel Aironet drivers.

> ./drivers/net/wireless/airo_cs.c
These are the "new" kernel Aironet drivers.
These files are unrelated to those above.
These files appear to be newer than either those in pcmcia-cs
or those in the latest (1.5.000) Cisco driver, which are based on
the same original code.
The advantage of the pcmcia-cs drivers is that they work with
earlier kernels.
The advantage of the Cisco drivers is that they are Cisco-approved [tm].
