i agree. We've recently factored out quite a bit of common code between 
i386 and x86_64 recently: genirq, gtod/clocksource and clockevents.
and that's how i think unification of architectures should be done: move 
code into kernel/* and drivers/*, _not_ into another architecture. That 
way all architectures benefit.
