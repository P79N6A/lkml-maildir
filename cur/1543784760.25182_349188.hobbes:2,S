We could stick a `mkdir -p include/linux` command just before executing
$(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=scripts/kconfig silentoldconfig
It should do the trick - no?

I will try to take a closer look at this tonight.
As always my head starts spinning when I look at the arch/um/Makefile
but I will see what I can do.
If I can simplify it and introduce full dependency checks it would be
really nice. 
It may add a Kbuild file to arch/um with the rules
for generating the header files.
