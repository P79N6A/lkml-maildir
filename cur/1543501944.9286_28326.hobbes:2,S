If the "little tweak" means completely replacing a member function by
another one at runtime? (Saw it somewhere, don't remember details)

It's part philosophy, I'd say: The linux kernel is written in a quite
particular OO style, the OO style suited to C++ is very different. Porting
the kernel (all 50Mb of it!) to C++ won't just happen.

The VFS is a class, each filesystem its subclass, each individual filessytem
on disk is an object.
