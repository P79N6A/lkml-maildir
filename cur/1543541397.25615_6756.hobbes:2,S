   I think this is a safe assumption, ide-cd works fine with < 2KB block
   size fs. Note that this problem is not restricted to HFS, ext2 with
   < 2KB block size on SCSI CD-ROM will also fail.
Having not heard anyone who complained about reported problems HFS
filesystems telling me that they have IDE devices, so noted.
Next question.  Is anyone lined up to fix this?  
(Jens, you're listed as the SCSI CDROM driver maintainer in the
MAINTAINERs file; are you going to be working on getting this fixed, or
is this a "will not fix" for 2.4?)
