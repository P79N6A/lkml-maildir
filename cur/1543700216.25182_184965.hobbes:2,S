Hi,
Apologies for posting this OT question here, I didn't find this question
answered in the FAQ.
There's a fast algorithm for longest-prefix match (as used in IPv4 routing
table lookups) which I have implemented, and would like to submit for
inclusion into the kernel (when 2.7 opens.)
However, I am aware that there is a patent on this algorithm, exclusively
licensed to a major manufacturer of networking equipment.
What am I to do?  Ignore the patent?  Or should I refrain from submitting
the patch I wrote, and look for an unencumbered algorithm instead?
thanks,
Lennert
