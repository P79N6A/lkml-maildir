It may be a good idea to rebase this patch off the new generic time- 
keeping
subsystem that John Stultz is working on.  He's cleaned up much of  
the code
relating to system time processing, which may make it easier to get it
right when skipping ticks (IE: You probably don't need to do anything
special to replay missed ticks, the new timer code automatically  
handles it
for you).  There is an excellent LWN article on his project here:
