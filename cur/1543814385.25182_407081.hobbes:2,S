Good catch, but I dont see how it would trigger the bug.

How does this simplify the locking ? It just removes the
hrtimer_cancel() call in hrtimer_start() and makes the
switch_hrtimer_base() code a bit simpler. 
The general locking rules would be still the same and I dont see
increased flexibility at all.

-ENOPARSE. Can you please explain what "allow drivers to create timer
sources" means and why the above locking is in the way ?
