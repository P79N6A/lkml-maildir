Hm, this is a bit awkward.  We need to map the shared info page fairly
early - say, around paging_init - but we're still on the bootmem
allocator at that point, so get_vm_area isn't usable yet.  Using a
fixmap keeps things simple.  It seems to me that having a single fixmap
available is useful for this kind of simple/early mapping, and if
someone needs to map something larger, then they can put it off until
get_vm_area() is available...
