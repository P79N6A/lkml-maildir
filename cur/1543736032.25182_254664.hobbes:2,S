Subject: 2.6.9-rc2-mm2: 3ware card info not in /proc/scsi

I have a 3Ware-7500 series card.  I was trying the 2.6.9-rc2-mm2 kernel
and discovered that the 3dmd utility was not working.  A little poking
around revealed that the cause was because the 3Ware directory was not
in /proc/scsi, even though I have CONFIG_SCSI_PROC_FS=y in my config
file.  The 3dmd utility works fine with mainline 2.6.9-rc2 and it worked
with the 2.6.8-mm series of kernels.  Those kernels have a 3w-xxxx
directory in /proc/scsi.
Thanks.
