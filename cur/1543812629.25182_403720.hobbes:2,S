Hello,
I'm trying to assert the status of AIO under the current version 
of Linux 2.6. However by searching I wasn't able to find any 
indication about it's current state. Is there anyone using it
under a production environment?
I'd like to know how complete it is and whether socket AIO is
adaquately supported.
Thanks,
