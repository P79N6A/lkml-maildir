Well, in all fairness, it can probably help more on certain 
microarchitectures. Intel is fairly aggressively OoO, especially in Core 
2, and predicted branches are not only free, they allow OoO to do a great 
job around them. But an in-order architecture doesn't have that, and cmov 
might show more of an advantage there.
