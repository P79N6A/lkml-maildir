You know that there are over 100 mm/ patches in -mm.  If Linus applies this
patch, it will cause extensive wreckage.  And this patch doesn't vaguely
apply to the mm/ patches which I have queued.  So it's basically useless.
Please try to play along.
yes, it's awkward that there's such a large backlog in that area.  We just
need to be patient and extra careful.
