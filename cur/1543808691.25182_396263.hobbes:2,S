I dont run Debian, but:
My G4/466 has the hwclock at 1970 for some reason. The early bootscripts
call klogd, which calls nanosleep. This syscall takes 3 hours to complete.
A bit userland debugging shows that hwclock is 1970, system time is also
1970 when nanosleep starts. But when it returns, the time is correct.
Its already at the end of the /etc/init.d/boot.d/S* scripts, nothing
else runs there. Bug exists since at least 2.6.15-git12, 2.6.15 was ok.
