The timer irq could keep running on the same CPU with irq disabled for
more than the rtdsc lower 32bits wrap around. Thus the per-cpu rdtsc info
has to be 64bit wide in your case (in the current 2.2.x code it doesn't
need that because it's _not_ a per-cpu info because we rely on the TSCs to
be in sync).
