I've finished beating the heck out of this driver. Over 12 hours of pounding
simultaneously on three NICs in a 2x SMP box running with preempt enabled and
not a single oops, BUG(), or deadlock. I'd say the driver is pretty solid at
this point; vda's locking patches seem to be safe. 
As a sidenote, the max throughput I was able to achieve across three cards was
about 1.4 MBytes/sec. A single card could do about 800 KBytes sec; 2 together
got to 1.2 MBytes/sec. Heavy CPU utilization the whole way, of course, since
these cards do not use DMA.
