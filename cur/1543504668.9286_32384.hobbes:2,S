vma's are shared when mm's are shared -- between threads.  That's the only
time.

Yeap, so how's about choosing to do readahead on mmaps by peeking at ptes
in the requesting process' page tables?  That gives us the ability to
handle tiled access patterns for no extra cost, is easy to implement and
low cost.  Note that the issue of page cache lookups can be intelligently
solved by increasing the size of a 'page' as stored in the page cache,
and filling in page tables preemptively to avoid the faults.  However,
keep in mind that page cache lookups are not very expensive as the lookup
is hash based, and if it ever is a problem, then preformance can be
improved by throwing memory at it.
