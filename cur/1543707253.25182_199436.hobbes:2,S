Ok, it worked fine with that line commented out.  I can switch vt's, be 
in X, etc. no problems.
The only issue I see is when I do a 'clear' on the vt, it doesn't clear 
the text, but blanks every nth row of pixels.  Switching vt's and back 
clears the screen.
There are also a few rows of garbage pixels at the bottom that linger 
across vt switches.
