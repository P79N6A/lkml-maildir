I was actually going to suggest making the CPU-hog detector _worse_, to 
see what the extreme behaviour of the "boost balancing" is. One of the 
things I would hope for is that the interactivity balancing would act as a 
damper on the CPU hug detector, and make it less important to get that one 
right in the first place.
