It seems that I cannot reproduce it anymore if I revert arch/i386/kernel/vm86.c
to the state of -rc3. Reverting clear_AC doesn't change anything, but the
rest of the patch does. I don't know why, it seems correct at first glance.
Perhaps old code hides a bug in the bios... Well, i don't know, I'm not
enough aware of apm or vm86 internals to understand what's happening.
Cheers,
Willy
