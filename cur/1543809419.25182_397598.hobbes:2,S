I moved to CIFS because SMB didn't work well for me, as well as did NFS. Both
seems to stall in a way, I could never really reproduce. But CIFS is very stable
over here. Never ever had a problem with it, whereas both NFS and SMB are likely
to cause trouble at least once a week. Without log records, without any chance
of recovery. Mostly hard-freezes.
