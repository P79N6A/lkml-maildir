preemptive kernel is not obvious patch at all. Just to show a very subtle
example you can't preempt the mmx clear-page or the FPU state will get
screwed up. An explicit preempt_lock() is necessary around the mmx stuff.
I'm not convinced having the kernel preemptable will be worthy even on UP
where we don't have the per-cpu data structure locking troubles. It looks
more fascinating stuff than real life stuff.
The other way around (the patch to allow some section of code to be
preemptible) was quite obviously right instead.
