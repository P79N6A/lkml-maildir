I think both are probably a good idea, on balance.  The .config
inclusion needn't use more than about 1200 bytes at the extreme (if
compressed, judging by mine), and one could hardly argue that this patch
would break stuff...  For space-conscious folk we can always make it a
config option ;-))
As for the patch-listing patch, I'd have it in my kernel.
