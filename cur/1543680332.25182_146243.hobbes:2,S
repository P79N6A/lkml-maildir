Subject: [PATCHKIT] 2.5.74 - seq_file conversion of /proc/net/atm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/8/274

  here comes a first cut at the aforementioned subject. It is divided in
height parts for easier review/integration/flamefest:
1 - devices;
2 - utility and common code for vcs (vc/pvc/svc);
3 - pvc;
4 - svc;
5 - vc;
6 - arp;
7 - lec;
8 - final cleanup.
Each part includes a short description. It is possible to build after
1), 5), 6), 7), 8) (and probably more but it hasn't been tested).
Some testing has been done with a couple of uniprocessor systems:
- 1 behaves well with one or two iphase adapters in the same box;
- 3, 4, 5 doesn't crash and it even seems to display the right number
  of vc. More testing to come;
- same comments apply for 6;
- 7 is completely untested. If somebody has typical scripts at hand for
  a back-to-back lane configuration, he will be welcome.
