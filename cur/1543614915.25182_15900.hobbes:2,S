The closest approximation my minds-eye can make of how things work
look something like this..
h h h h h
\ | | | /
 m  m m
  \ |/
  ttt
   |
   l
h - random j hacker working on same file/subsystem different goals
m - maintainer for file/subsys
t - "forked" tree maintainer (-ac, -dj, -aa etc..)
l - Linus
Whilst development happens concurrently in parallel, the notion of
progress is somewhat serialised as changes work their way down to
Linus.
(This whole thing goes a little astray when random j hacker sends
 patches straight to Linus bypassing everyone else and they get
 merged, but the controlled anarchy prevails and everyone somehow
 gets back in sync).
Dave.
