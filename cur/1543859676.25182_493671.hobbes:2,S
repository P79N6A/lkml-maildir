Hi,
Hmm. taking a peek at the bzImage there...

This is the end of the realmode kernel, and it should be followed by the
32-bit code that is to be executed at (normally) 0x100000, right? This
is however not the case here. Where did arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S
go then? What is the significance of this value 0x0013354e? It is in
fact
exactly the size of the compressed kernel image.
I have no idea what went wrong, but it went wrong in the build process
of the bzImage.
Hope this helps,
    Alexander
