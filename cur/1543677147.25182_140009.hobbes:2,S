It works on my computer at least. When loading the psmouse module I
get this:
        input: PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio2
        Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
         Firware: 5.6
         180 degree mounted touchpad
         Sensor: 18
         new absolute packet format
         Touchpad has extended capability bits
         -> four buttons
         -> multifinger detection
         -> palm detection
        input: Synaptics Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio4
The touchpad and the mouse operates independently of each other. The
mouse generates relative events as usual and the touchpad generates
absolute events as defined by my previous patch.
