In principle they will.  I'm just tidying up the kiobuf locking right
now to fix a couple of minor problems, and I'll see how trivial it is to
allow mmaping them while I do that.  Binding them into a known vma is
not hard, it's just a matter of tracking things so that they can be
munmap()ed cleanly later.
