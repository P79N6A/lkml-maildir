If 2 threads attached to the same process are blocking on different
locks on different files (maybe even on different servers) but have the
same lock arguments (i.e. same offset+length - actually quite common,
since most processes try to lock the entire file) then the first GRANTED
call that wakes one up will also wake the other.
By checking the filehandle and server IP address, we ensure that this
only happens if the locks truly are referencing the same file.
