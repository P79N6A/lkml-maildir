Subject: [PATCH] add an RCU version of list splicing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/3/112

This patch is in support of the IPMI driver.  I have tested this
with the IPMI driver changes coming in the next patch.
Add a list_splice_init_rcu() function to splice an RCU-protected list
into another list.  This takes the sync function as an argument, so
one would do something like:
	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&list);
	list_splice_init_rcu(&source, &dest, synchronize_rcu);
The idea being to keep the RCU API proliferation down to a dull roar.
