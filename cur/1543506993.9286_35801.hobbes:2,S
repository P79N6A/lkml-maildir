hi
I have a network of Dell Optiplexes which have a built in 3C918 which is
detected as a 3c905B Cyclone.
My network is currently running 10baseT.
I am getting the following messages in the log
Aug 20 18:13:20 madeira ypbind[297]: clnt_create for server
parana.xstreamlogic.com failed

where madeira is the optiplex and parana is my nfs server
Both server and client are running stock Redhat 6.0 with redhat
upgrades(2.2.5-22). I have another client(running the exact same
software configuration) using a Dlink card on the same network talking
to the same server and never seeing such a message. My Dells seem to
have these messages often. On my 10baseT network things seem to work ok.
However when I tried an experiment to upgrade my network to a 100BaseT,
all hell broke loose. 
I connected my Dell to a 10/100 Linksys hub, and was flooded with the
above messages especially the ones where nfs couldn't get a request
slot. And my machine was basically useless as it spent most of its time,
trying to talk to the network.
My server has an Intel EtherPro 100(its a dell 4300 poweredge).
I am wondering if there is any issue with the 3com cards and nfs. I
called linuxcare and they had no clue and suggested that there may be
some RPC problems.
I would really like to upgrade to a 100base network, but don't relish
the thought of replacing my NICs. Any suggestions would be really
helpful.
Thanks
Naren
