In fact, your last commit was broken, exactly because you had _not_ done 
this part right.
Your parent information was crap, meaning that when I pulled, I had to
re-merge. In fact, I'm going to undo this pull entirely, because of this -
it's simply _wrong_. You claim to have done a merge and indeed your "data"
is merged, but your history is totally buggered because you didn't do the 
proper parents.
