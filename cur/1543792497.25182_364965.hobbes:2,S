Isn't this just because the device size is > 2**32?  What if you use fseeko(3)
and #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64?
Okay, still not portable and there is probably a better way that doesn't rely
on such nonsense.  For example, since you have a minimum size in mind,
just seek that much and see if it works - you don't really need to know the
whole disk size for that.  Or figure out the best way on all of your platforms
and abstract it.
