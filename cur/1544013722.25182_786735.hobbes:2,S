Hello.
Adding "nolapic" option to kernel command line causes /proc/cpuinfo to show
only 1 CPU, while the machine has 2 CPUs and the kernel was compiled with
CONFIG_SMP=y.
Something is wrong with CPU recognition/initialization code?

 .
I confirmed that this problem occurs on native Ubuntu 8.04 (i386) and
native CentOS 5.2 (x86_64) on ThinkPad X60 (Core 2 Duo).
Kernel 2.6.26.8 seems to be OK.
Regards.
