Well, actually I was also suggesting that there really shouldn't be
RODATA_SECTION at all, and every linker script should just use
RODATA_CONTENTS embedded in an existing section of their choice or in a
trivial .rodata section, e.g:
   .rodata { RODATA_CONTENTS }

No, in fact I don't think it would -- your suggestion is that there
should be a single macro affected by all sorts of `magic defines' that
somehow change its behavior (e.g. LOAD_OFFSET, and the
output-memory-area defines you mentioned to solve my output memory
region problem).  This sort of structure seems very confusing to me,
even if it's superficially simpler (by having only a `single macro').
Not having the macro(s) create output sections makes the result a _lot_
easier to understand, since there's not all this behind-the-scenes
tweaking going on by the macro, it's all pretty straight-forward.

I see your point, but is this really a problem in practice?  I suspect
that about 99% of the time you can get away with simply being a bit
conservative, e.g., aligning to an 8- or 16-byte boundary (I would be
very surprised if there's an arch that aligns structs more than that,
for obvious reasons).

Um, no I don't.  I just want to control where the output sections go,
e.g., into RAM or ROM, and how the load-time and run-time addresses are
related.  Most of the time I don't care what the output sections are,
as long as I can control their disposition.

I'm not sure what you mean by `segments' (the GNU ld linker script
documentation is dreadful), but I'll try to look them up and see if they
can help me solve my problem.

That sounds clumsy to me, because it adds lots of `parameters' to the
common macros -- I'd prefer a solution where the macros can be as much
of a black-box as possible -- but it will probably work.
