Uh, no. I think (but am not sure) that more @home.com addresses became
@attbi.com than @cox.net. Even if I'm wrong about that, I'm almost certain
that more became @attbi.com + @rogers.ca + @shaw.ca + @charterpipeline.com
+ @comcast.net + ... than @cox.net. (It's possible that I made errors in
the past sentence, perhaps confusing .com and .net stuff or the like, but
even in the face of such errors I think my point still stands.)

I wouldn't be surprised if four out of five weren't with Cox in the first
place.
