I do believe so. 
I'm really asking why it tries to use DMA, when it's not available,
thereby oopsing the kernel. I'm considering getting a Promise controller,
but I'd really like an EISA one, as there are only 2 PCI slots in this
machine ;).
Can anyone say hens teeth?
Looks like I'm gonna sacrifice my single remaining PCI slot, or just put
all the IDE stuff in my second machine, and get a coupla 100Mbit cards.
