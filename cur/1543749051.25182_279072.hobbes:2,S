Thanks.
I've tried to use netconsole, but it did not work very
well in my case. 
So, I want to try serial console. I have 2 computers,
one is a PC, and the other is a Laptop. Unfortunately,
my Laptop doesn't have a serial port on it. But then,
the each machine has a internal serial modem
respectively.
Then, can I use a telephone line to directly connect
the two machines via their internal modems (i.e. One
end of the telephone line is plugged into The PC's
modem, and the other end is plugged into The Laptop's
modem directly), and let them do the same function as
two serial ports and a null modem can do? If it is,
How to achieve that?
Thank you.
