I agree cpufreq changes could be the source. However, things still
aren't making sense, since the accumulation is cycle based to begin
with, so any cpufreq caused drift in time won't be noticed until NTPd
starts adjusting the output from current_tick_len().
Vladis: I don't want to overwhelm you with patches to try, I think
Roman's debug patches should help show where the issue is. But if you've
got the time, try the patch below to quickly see if the cpufreq changes
are indeed causing the problem.

Hmm. Yea, while I'm not sure this is the issue at hand, it does look
like I need to get some of the boot ordering worked out here. Using the
PIT early on probably isn't the best solution as the 18us access latency
might not be the best for the transition calibration. Currently jiffies
is the default clocksource until late_initcall time, which was done to
minimize the clocksource churn at boot time.  I'm not quite recalling
the details, but I think the motivation was to avoid confusion when
looking at the dmesg, so we could instead allow clocksources to be
selected as they load, but disable printing anything to dmesg until
after late_initcall.
I'll start working on that.
thanks

This patch tries blocking the cpufreq changes to see if its causing the
accounting issue.
