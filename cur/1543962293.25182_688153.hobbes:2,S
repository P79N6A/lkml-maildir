i`m also seeing this one, but with pcnet32 - "modprobe -r pcnet32" never 
returns and
"unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. Usage count = 1"
being printed over and over again
lsmod |grep pcnet32 shows
pcnet32            35828    0
mii                      9344    1    pcnet32
i see stale ssh connection on port 22 and sshd for that session remains 
unkillable process.
