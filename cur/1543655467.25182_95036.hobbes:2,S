You should only need this:
+#ifndef CONFIG_PSKEYBOARD
+#define kbd_controller_present()       0
+#endif
I think the following hunk should be superfluous:
+#ifdef CONFIG_PSKEYBOARD
 #define kbd_read_input() inb(KBD_DATA_REG)
 #define kbd_read_status() inb(KBD_STATUS_REG)
 #define kbd_write_output(val) outb(val, KBD_DATA_REG)
 #define kbd_write_command(val) outb(val, KBD_CNTL_REG)
+#else
+#define kbd_read_input()       0
+#define kbd_read_status()      0
+#define kbd_write_output(val)
+#define kbd_write_command(val)
+#endif
Or is there some case where pc_keyb will use kbd_read_input() and
friends even if kbd_controller_present() is false?
We have the equivalent of the first hunk in asm-ia64/keyboard.h, and
the kbd_controller_present() hook should be used consistently to
avoid breakage.  For example, if you include the second hunk, and
pc_keyb.c changes to use kbd_read_input() even when kbd_controller_present()
is false, i386 might still work but ia64 would break.
