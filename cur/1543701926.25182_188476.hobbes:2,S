If I totally disable coalescing, in arch/x86_64/pci-gart.c by adding the if (1 || ...
then the bughalt goes away. So might some performance, but a system that runs is
MUCH better than one that hard faults on a regular basis.
The shipped scsi driver still needs to be updated to NOT "offline" the drives.
the 2.0.5 driver does this quite well.
Thank you.
