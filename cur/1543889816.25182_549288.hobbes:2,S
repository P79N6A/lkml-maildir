It wouldn't be the first time.
Uwe, please generate the `dmesg -s 1000000' output for 2.6.22-rc2 and for
2.6.22-rc2-mm1, feed them through `diff -u' and see if you can spot any
interesting-looking differences in the PCI/ACPI/IRQ area.  Send both the
files to me and I'll stick them on a server and then I'll see if we can
hunt down the perpetrator.
Thanks.
