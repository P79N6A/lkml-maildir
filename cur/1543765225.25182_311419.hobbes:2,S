Looks quite smart, but people will argue it will keep all __init
sections in this way. I'd like we keep the default behavior of __init.

This is what IA64 does. In this way, you must clean up the bogomips
message, TSC synchronization. And CPU_UP could be called in user
context, so fork_idle possibly should be in workqueue. And please make
sure it doesn't break other things like check_nmi_watchdog. I just
select an easy way (add smp_prepare_cpu) and it doesn't break anything.

IA64 also does like this. It synchronizes one AP's ITC against BP's one
time. But in IA32, TSC's upper 32 bits can be written only on prescott
and above. In earlier CPU, upper 32 bits will become 0 after any write.

You possibly can refer to IA64's implementation. The goal of my patches
are to support suspend/resume, which actually doesn't really hotremove a
CPU, so I just ignored the sysfs/ACPI issues.
