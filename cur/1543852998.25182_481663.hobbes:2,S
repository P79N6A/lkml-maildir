In this case the name is a sysfs file to indicate the load on the  
battery; so spaces are frowned upon and "load:mW" would probably work  
the best.

Whoops; sorry, I was writing this too early in the morning without my  
caffeine and got myself turned around.  What I _meant_ to say was this:
"I conceivably see a need for a "load:mC_s" versus "load:mW",  
depending on the hardware-reported units, but never both at the same  
time."
Essentially if the hardware reports units of milli-watts or milli- 
Calories-per-second or whatever, then we should report that directly  
and let userspace convert as appropriate; keeping the floating-point  
out of the kernel.
Cheers,
