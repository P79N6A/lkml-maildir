Hello,
If I try to compile a 2.4.x (0-3) kernel for my SGI 540 Workstation and I
enable SGI Virtual Workstation support (under general setup) the compilation
stops with the error "kernel.o: In function 'enable_irq' etc...".
Previous kernels, such as 2.2.19 compile without any problem (same options).
Anyone a idea of what's wrong ?
