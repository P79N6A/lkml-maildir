When you say "two people" I am afraid we are not talking about the same case.

You suggest just to check ARCH value and not apply your patch. This was
not my initial understanding as was hopefully obvious from my reply.
So you suggest to make the ARCH= setting on the command line mandatory
again even for a configured kernel which is a step backward.
I assume your patch also has this drawback - no?
If user did NOT specify ARCH we should use the kernel configuration - which
your solution fail to do.
If user did specify ARCH and the kernel is configured then what?
-> Ignore the ARCH= setting
-> Warn if they do not match
-> Always adhere to the ARCH setting
Accepting the solution where we check the ARCH as you suggested and
loose the benefits of letting the configuration be the master should
be OK for upcoming kernel release.
