Yes, it is a quite common problem. You'll have to deal with it
somehow.  Somehow it can be fixed by disabling "cross spectrum
clocking" or similar in the BIOS setup, but on others it 
is unfixable.
Ultimatively the kernel will need to move to a per CPU time base
to deal with this better, but that is a future project.
For user space I would suggest to use gettimeofday() or better
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...) in 2.6 to get time stamps
and let the kernel deal with it.

The usual way to is to turn off tsc support in gettimeofday.  This can
be done by booting with "notsc" That should be the only code relying
on it. The scheduler did in some 2.6 versions, but that has been also
fixed (it can tolerate non monotonous times now). Other code
who reads the TSC directly has to deal with it.
e.g. x86-64 just forces HPET gettimeofday when SMP is on, which slows
down gettimeofday greatly.
