You were close!
I changed my Memory Timing from 1T to 2T, and now it is as solid as a
rock.  It has been up 7 minutes as I type this, without a hiccup.

    Well as most Athlon 64 users know, 1T setting improves performance quite
    significantly over 2T, but it is also very taxing on the memory and
    quite a hit-and-miss when matching different memory with different
    boards. From some users' feedback, the Asus A8N SLI can be a little
    picky with 1T setting when overclocking, so results might be a little
    better with other boards.
