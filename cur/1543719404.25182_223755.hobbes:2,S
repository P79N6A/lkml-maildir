Hi,
Something between 2.6.7-rc1 and current 2.6-BK broke usb printing here
again. I have two printers attached:
usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using address 6
usb 1-1: control timeout on ep0out
usb 1-1: control timeout on ep0out
usb 1-1: device not accepting address 6, error -110
usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using address 7
usb 1-1: control timeout on ep0out
usb 1-1: control timeout on ep0out
usb 1-1: device not accepting address 7, error -110
It's a VIA EPIA-800 board, lspci shows the following for usb:
00:11.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB (rev 24)
00:11.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB (rev 24)
