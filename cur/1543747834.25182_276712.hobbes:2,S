Pasting from xclip to Mozilla Thunderbird works for me IFF the selection 
is 4096 bytes or less. But it looks like a bug in xclip, not Mozilla. 
Try this:
$ (for i in `seq 1 4096`; do echo -n 'a'; done) | xclip
$ xclip -o
aaaaaaaaaaaa......aaa
$ (for i in `seq 1 4097`; do echo -n 'a'; done) | xclip
$ xclip -o
[hangs]
This is with SuSE 8.2 and xclip from a Debian package 
xclip_0.08-4_i386.deb .

Not a Mozilla bug.
