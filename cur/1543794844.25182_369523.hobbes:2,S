Either you're wrong or I'm confused.  I don't see the include path which
necessarily drags asm/irq.h in from linux/interrupt.h.  There's a
linux/interrupt.h -> linux/hardirq.h -> asm/hardirq.h path, but not all
asm/hardirq.h files drag in asm/irq.h.  Look at sparc64 or alpha for
examples of that.
Personally, I'd like to see asm/hardirq.h go away and move all its
contents into asm/irq.h.  And I'd like to see asm/irq.h included
explicitly from linux/interrupt.h.  And I'd like to see drivers stop
including asm/irq.h.
While I'm dreaming, I'd like a pony.
