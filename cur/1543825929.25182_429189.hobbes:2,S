Hmm, remount would be saner if we wanted to take that approach...

But its not just a moment, a quotacheck needs to scan every inode
in the filesystem (on disk) to correctly account for all space/inode
usage.  Its not something to be encouraging people to do frequently,
and it would also be very difficult to correctly implement (while the
filesystem is actively being modified I mean).
