A pretty obvious note: instead of repeating this nice but pretty lengthy 
comment 3 times in the same file, wouldn't it be better to write at 
further locations something like
 	/* Enforce IO-ordering. See comment in <function> for details. */
Also helps if you later have to modify the comment, or move it, or add 
more mmiowb()s, or do some other modifications.
Thanks
