Ouch.  Boot splash patches.
Well, we had real mode in qemu once, we can put it there again.

My plan was to allow userspace to register certain mmio addresses for 
cacheing, so that if the guest code had a code sequence like
  writel(dst_x_reg, x);
  writel(dst_y_reg, y)
  writel(width_reg, w);
  writel(height_reg, h);
  writel(blt_cmd_reg, fill);
then kvm would cache the first four in a mmap()able memory area and only 
exit to userspace on the fifth.  Userspace would then read the cached 
registers from memory and emulate the command.
This saves userspace transitions but not guest/host switches.  I'm 
counting on Intel and AMD to reduce the cost of these, but it will 
probably never be cheap.
Paravirtualized drivers are also an option; we may try to keep 
compatibility with Xen's.

Do you mean putting the device model into the kernel?

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
