actually, it *appears* that the standard works this way.  the macro
"__deprecated" is defined in compiler-gcc.h with:
    #define __deprecated __attribute__((deprecated))
while the more generic compiler.h handles whether or not it was
defined:
    #ifndef __deprecated
    # define __deprecated           /* unimplemented */
    #endif
so i'm guessing that's how any new attribute shortcut macros should be
handled, yes?
