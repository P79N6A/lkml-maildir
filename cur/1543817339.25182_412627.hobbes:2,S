This has acquire and release, instead of the generic kernel
memory barriers rmb and wmb. As such, I don't think it would
get merged.

I think you should fight the fights you can win and get a 90%
solution ;) at any rate you do need to fix the existing routines
unless you plan to audit all callers...
First, fix up ia64 in 2.6-head, this means fixing test_and_set_bit
and friends, smp_mb__*_clear_bit, and all the atomic operations that
both modify and return a value.
Then add test_and_set_bit_lock / clear_bit_unlock, and apply them
to a couple of critical places like page lock and buffer lock.
Is this being planned?
