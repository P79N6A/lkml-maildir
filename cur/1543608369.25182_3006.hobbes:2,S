Subject: system locks up when trying to use soundcard.

Here's how I can reproduce it:
1) I load the sound modules.
2) I play an mp3(mpg123 abcd.mp3)
If I switch consoles or start it while I'm in X, it locks up.  If I don't, it keeps playing..
I've tried two different soundcards and two different isa slots.
The sound cards use ad1848.o and sb.o.
One is a sound blaster 16 pnp, and the other is an aztech.(microsoft sound
system)
Anybody know what's going on?
Let me know if you need any more info.
