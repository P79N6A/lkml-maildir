That's only true if we use the current swsusp code to restore the image.  If 
this becomes an issue, we can always use the kexec approach to restore the 
image, even if that required a double kexec boot to slot in the hibernation 
kernel, as kexec boot overhead is low.

Using kexec may be as transparent as it gets.  What's critical here, is to 
never try memory dependent operations from within the normal kernel, not 
even backup, as that would get you into an inter-dependency mess we dearly 
want to avoid.

This part could easily be handled by the normal kernel before and after 
resume.

This should be the responsibility of the kexec'd hibernating kernel.  Note 
though in (6), the normal kernel takes care of preparing devices, then the 
hibernating kernel dumps the image and either calls S4 or S3.  On resume 
from S3 it can immediately switch over to the normal kernel, and from S4 the 
known bootup would occur.

The latest hibernating kexec patches boot a kexec'd modular kernel with 
initramfs into crashkernel=16M@16M in less than one second.  Switch-back is 
almost instant.  Add to this the time required to either store or restore 
the image, and it may be obvious that this approach isn't slower, but maybe 
even faster than the current swsusp.
Thanks!
