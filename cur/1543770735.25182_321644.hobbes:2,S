If the codepage differs, you simply use different arguments for that 
option. Is there a _technical_ reason why "hfscodepage" and "codepage" 
might behave differently? Otherwise I'd prefer to use the same name for 
the option.
Why do you build the extra translation tables? I'm not relly convinced 
this is a kernel problem at all, but doing it more like fat would be more 
acceptable (maybe just with some more sane defaults).
(BTW please try to inline the patch otherwise it's rather difficult to 
quote from it.)

Please fix the coding style.

If you add a new argument, use "struct superblock *sb" as the first 
argument.
