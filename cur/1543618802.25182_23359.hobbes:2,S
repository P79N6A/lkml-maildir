If the variable holds a boolean in the C language, fair enough but if
it's being used as a range in a truth-value system of _another_
language, i.e. it simply _represents_ a truth value, I would write it
differently.
If it were a theorem proving paper, the different kinds of variable
would have a different font or colour :-)

You seem to have missed the point.  We _know_ the C language rules.  I
agree that non-strict typeing is quite useful, although C is in fact
quite strict.  Lisp has far less strict typing :-)

Perhaps, but it's pretty useful for something other.
