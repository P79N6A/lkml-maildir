Agreed. Anything of the sort should be in userspace.

Putting a full GL stack into the kernel is just plain idiotic. Among the 
suggestions I made in an initial reply to this was keeping everything 
possible in userspace adn providing only the minimum necessary stuff 
in-kernel.
Doing otherwise - providing full emulation for unsupported commands or 
features - is just copying the mistakes made by M$ with DirectX.

Exactly what I suggested on seeing the original post.
I am currently looking for some information or help in making the Framebuffer 
devices use DRM and setting up a userspace system that interfaces with the 
DRM backed framebuffer device to provide full 2D and 3D acceleration of all 
supported features and *userspace* emulation of the unsupported stuff.
Mesa is a good place to start for the 3D stuff, and either XAA or one of the 
numerous 2D graphics packages would be a place to start for the 2D 
acceleration.
