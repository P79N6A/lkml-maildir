A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing 
which he cares about more than he does about his personal safety, 
is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made 
and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. 
	-- John Stuart Mill, writing on the U.S. Civil War in 1862
