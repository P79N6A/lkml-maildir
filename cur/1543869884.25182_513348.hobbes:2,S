I changed the check to just "val > 0".
The comments in the kernel around the implementation and
declaration of the function wait_event_interruptible()
VERY CLEARLY state that the possible return values are:
1) Negative error code on interrupt
2) Zero if timeout expired
3) Positive non-zero value if condition became true before
   timeout expired
So there is no doubt that "val > 0" is sufficient.
