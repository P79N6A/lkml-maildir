Are you sure your first execve even works? I would have used
   if (execvp(argv[1], &argv[1]) < 0)
	...
just so (a) I do not have to deal with the ugly 'extern char **environ'
[such should have been in a libc header imho] or use
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp); (b) execvp so that
it looks through $PATH, just as /bin/su (resp. the shell it starts) would do.
