Check your syslog for problems, check your filesystem for errors. If 
none shows up errors, you might have bad RAM - check it with memtest86.

When you have multiple CPUs with one interrupt controller, you don't
have much choice. You either use spin-locks or you Blue-Screen.
Since Linux doesn't have a "Blue-screen of death", it needs spin-
locks.
