Marcelo, 
	Saw you've inc'ed the EXTRAVERSION in bk, so I figured I should send
this fix to you before you mailed out pre11.
I'm not sure if its the "proper" fix, but solves:
arch/i386/kernel/kernel.o: In function `fix_broken_hp_bios_irq9':
arch/i386/kernel/kernel.o(.text.init+0x3601): undefined reference to
`broken_hp_bios_irq9'
arch/i386/kernel/kernel.o(.text.init+0x3614): undefined reference to
`broken_hp_bios_irq9'
thanks
-john
PS: agpgart seems broken as well, but I don't normally build w/ it, so
I'll leave the fix to someone who knows what they're doing.
