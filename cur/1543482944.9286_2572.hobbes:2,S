Garbage collector has bug, which effectively limits dst creation rate
with default parameter settings to very low value (sort of 50 per second).
max_size	- hard limit on number of dst entries.
gc_thresh	- after number of routes exceeds this number, gc starts.
gc_min_interval - gc is not invoked more frequently (in seconds).
		  BUG#1: interval is measured in seconds, so that
		  it cannot be made <1sec.
gc_elasticity   - this number determines dynamic "equilibrium" point,
		  where dst cache size stops to grow further.
		  Ideally max_size should not be ever achieved.
		  The greater it is, the less agressive GC is.
Bug is that only limited number of routes (<256) can be freed during
one GC round. It means that now rate of flow creations is limited
by 256/gc_min_interval :-(
Please, try to leave gc_thresh and max_size at their default values,
but to decrease gc_min_interval to 1 and to decrease gc_elasticity to
2,3 etc. It should help a bit. As extremal measure you may set
gc_min_interval to 0 and/or to increase gc_thresh. It is better to leave
max_size intact.
Bug is supposed to be fixed in the patch
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/kernel-ssXXYYZZ.dif.gz
You need not the whole patch: only chunks patching
ipv4/route.c, function rt_garbage_collect()
