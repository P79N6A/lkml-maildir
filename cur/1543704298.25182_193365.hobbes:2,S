Network code does *NOT* wait for references to kobject to disappear.
->release() for those buggers is not in a module and freeing can
happen way after the rmmod.  No threads involved.
What it does wait for is different - in effect, net_device has a special-cased
rwsem in it, heavily optimised for down_read().  dev_hold() is an equivalent
of down_read().  dev_put() - up_read().  And unregister_netdev() does an
equivalent of down_write() after removing from all search structures.
That's what it is waiting for - it wants all readers (semaphore is unfair)
to go away.  It's not a refcounting issue at all - it's an exclusion around
the net_device shutdown, freeing resources, etc.
There was an optimistic attempt to turn that animal into sysfs refcount.
It didn't work - we had to add real refcounting there and make sysfs code
do essentially an equivalent of down_try_read() before accessing the guts
of net_device().  And we have ->release() for those buggers in core kernel.
