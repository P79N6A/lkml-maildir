yes. We definitely need this on the asm syscall level, to not contaminate 
hundreds of syscalls with tracepoints.
Auke's sys_open() plugin would be a nice prototype for that concept - but 
in generally it would be useful to be able to augment kernel tracer output 
with all syscall events that occur.
The output would be something like a slimmed-down strace, but for the 
whole kernel and not tied to ptrace semantics (which are crippling).
Would you be interested in extending your syscall tracing concept with 
those bits and would you be interested in integrating Auke's plugin into 
that
