        Well, I believe SGI has a lockmetering package out there, and it
        can be modified to do spin lock timeouts quite easily.
        Unfortunately, this adds a bit of overhead to the kernel.

        Exactly.  You may want to look into a watchdog card, or even the
        software watchdog timer that already exists in the kernel.
