Right... I admit I didn't even notice the printk_btext stuff leaked with
this patch, this is debug stuff that wasn't really supposed to get out
of my tree, oh well... I shouldn't do patches when I'm sick with +40°
fever...
Andrew, the only bits of the kernel/printk.c that are supposed to get
to your tree are related to is_console_locked() at this point. The
force_printk_to_btext is a debug tool that allow to route all printk's
to some early-boot output mecanism, though it would eventually be
acceptable upstream with Geert's idea of arch_printk...
Cheers,
Ben.
