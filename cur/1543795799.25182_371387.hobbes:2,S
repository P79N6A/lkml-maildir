Linus-
Good point... I don't know what is going on there.  That box is running 
a newly-installed debian sarge, with it's default startup scripts.  I 
have done nothing to that system besides kernel testing and v4l / dvb 
testing and development.
The oops was showing up immediately before xorg opens with it's 
user-login box...
In other words, the OOPS is the last thing to show on the screen in text 
mode, before the console switches into X, using debian sarge's default 
bootup process.
I have no idea why gdb is running.... hmm... Anyhow, I'm away from that 
machine right now, and it is powered off, so I can't look directly at 
the startup scripts right now.  Would you like me to send more info 
later on when I get home?  If so, what would you like to see?
Cheers,
Michael Krufky
