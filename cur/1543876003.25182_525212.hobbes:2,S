Unless a function that has more than 1 caller is very tiny or reduces at 
compile time to a very tiny rest, it's not expected that inlining was 
faster on current CPUs.
But most times that's already only up to the compiler - e.g. current gcc 
versions already automatically inline all static functions with only 
1 caller.

Thanks.
