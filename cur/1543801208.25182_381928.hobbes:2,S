TASK_NONINTERACTIVE helps in this regard, is no cost in the code where 
it's used and probably decreases the costs in the scheduler code by 
enabling some processing to be skipped.  If by its judicious use the 
heuristic is only fed interactive sleep data the heuristics accuracy in 
identifying interactive tasks should be improved.  It may also allow the 
heuristic to be simplified.
Other potential information sources the priority calculation may also 
benefit from TASK_INTERACTIVE.  E.g. measuring interactive latency 
requires knowing that the task is waking from an interactive sleep.

Which is why SCHED_BATCH has promise.  The key for it becoming really 
useful will be getting authors of non interactive programs to use it. 
The hard part will be getting them to admit that their programs are non 
interactive and undeserving of a boost.

I've never actually seen what bonuses the screensaver gets :-) but I 
imagine any sleeping they do is in a very regular sleep/run pattern and 
this regularity can be measured and used to exclude them from bonuses. 
However, it would need some extra parameters to avoid depriving audio 
and video programs of bonuses as they too have very regular sleep/run 
patterns.  The average sleep/run interval is one possibility as 
audio/video programs tend to use small intervals.
