No, the PowerstackII Pro4000 (Utah) has no residual. I couldn't see 
anything unusal in the bootlogs except that
neither IDE nor SCSI interrupts occour (timeouts for SCSI and lost 
interrupts for IDE). I assume other PCI-devices have a similar problem. 
I will try to extract some bootlogs in the next days but I think they 
won't help.
