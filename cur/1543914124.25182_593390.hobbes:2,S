You will see that it could be shared, and it'll be much easier to see 
all configurations it's used in.
Currently, there are 6 or 7 different ways how a function under 
arch/i386/ could be used by a function under arch/x86_64/ (and vice 
versa) and it's non-trivial to figure out all usages when grep'ing for 
users.
