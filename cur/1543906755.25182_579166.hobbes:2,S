I don't think this is new, -rc1 has always been a mid-merge sync point as 
much as (or more then) a release candidate. I can't think of any -rc2s 
that haven't included fairly significant merges since -rc1. now some of 
the -rc1s have been more useable then others, and this series does look 
like it's going to be rougher and longer then most (due in large part to 
the scheduler changes), but it's more a difference in degree then in type.
