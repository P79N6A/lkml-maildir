Given this costs 1uS in a path that is not performance critical is it
worth putting the #ifdef/#endif in instead of having one set of code that
works for all ?

Suppose it doesn't clear ? Should also use cpu_relax() in busy loops
so any processor variant with power management can do the right thing.
Neither of course are bugs you have added, just things you have moved that
seem worth asking about.
