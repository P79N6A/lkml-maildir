hi,
quick question here. [kernel-src]/Documentation/Changes and
[kernel-src]/README say two different things about which version of gcc
is recommended for the compiling of the linux kernel. README says egcs
1.1.2 and Documentation/Changes says to use gcc 2.95.3 or greater.
is the last egcs release still the preferred or has that changed to the
gcc 2.95.x releases?
i assume that README is outdated and should not mention a version of gcc
at all for compilation of the src. it seems that README instructs the user
to refer to Documentation/Changes for the latest info but makes it confusing
by stating, "Make sure you have gcc-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2) available."
