Fact is that it isn't working with what is in the kernel today.
That is enough for justifying the removal of what is dead code today.
If someone submits at some point in the future a patch using this stuff 
he can as well put these tiny bits back.
But Linux kernel development is not driven by people producing hot air 
about what they wish to see in the future, Linux kernel development is 
driven by people sending patches.
