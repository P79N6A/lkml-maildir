Because sometimes it matters.  For example, in kernel mode (and certainly for
embedded programs that I'm more familiar with), the kernel does go through and
zero out the so called BSS segment, so that normally uninitialized static
variables will follow the rules as laid out under the C standards (both C89 and
C99).  I can imagine however, that the code that is executed before the BSS
area is zeroed out needs to be extra careful in terms of statics that it
references, and those must be hand initialized.
