what is the real advantage to package uml-kernel and rootfs into a single 
file ?
If this needs to be distributed with additional script, that's two files, 
anyway.
the classical way would be 3 files:  uml-kernel, rootfs, script - put into 
some tar.gz or tar.bz2
this could look as elegant like:
linux-2.6.21-UML-TryMe-and-RunMe-Kit.tar.bz2
linux-2.6.21-start.sh  (containing ./linux-2.6.21-kernel-um 
ubd0=linux-2.6.21-rootfs.....)
linux-2.6.21-kernel-um
linux-2.6.21-rootfs

wicked, though! :)

I've done the converse: package the uml kernel within the rootfs image,
and use a script that plays the part of bootloader. With ext2 at least,
it's fairly easy to use the debugfs 'cat' command for this.
That way, you simply distribute the fs image with a companion script
that can boot any number of such images.
