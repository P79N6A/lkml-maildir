While on the subject of aic7xxx Makefiles, they add the
"-Werror" flag to CFLAGS in both lk 2.4.22-rc2 and
lk 2.6.0-test3 .
This flag can be annoying if there is some messiness in
include files somewhere. In my case some mis-applied patches
in the ide headers cause otherwise harmless compiler warning.
That is until my kernel build tries to build the aic7xxx driver.
As a side note drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/Makefile seems to be the only
Makefile in lk 2.4.22-rc2 adding the "-Werror" flag. About a
dozen Makefiles add it in lk 2.6.0-test3 (mainly in the alpha
and sparc64 architecture trees).
