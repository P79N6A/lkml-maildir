I suppose portmap doesn't pose too much of a security risk on a dialup
machine from home, but I don't need it so why should I be running it.
I know this thread has been around once before.  The solution that came
up then was to remove all reference to "nis" and "nisplus" from the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file.
Well I'm running glibc 2.1.3 and used the sample nsswitch.conf that came
with it.  And unlike the 2.1.2 release of glibc, it contains no such
entries.
So what is the solution now?  Do I just need to swallow my pride of
having no serivces running, and fire up portmap?
