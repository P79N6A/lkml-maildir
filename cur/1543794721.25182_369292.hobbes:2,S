Indeed.  tmpfs is crackpottery.

Skip the writepage if !mapping_cap_writeback_dirty(page->mapping), I guess.
Or, if appropriate, just sync the file.  Use filemap_fdatawrite() or even
refactor do_fsync() and use most of that.
Also, write_page() doesn't need to run set_page_dirty(); ->commit_write()
will do that.
Several kmap()s in there which can become kmap_atomic().
bitmap_init_from_disk() might be leaking bitmap->filemap on kmalloc-failed
error path.
bitmap->filemap_attr can be allocated with kzalloc() now.
