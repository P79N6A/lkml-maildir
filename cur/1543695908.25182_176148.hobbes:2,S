[I did try google, but wasn't lucky, so...]
Is there a way to query/set getrlimit/setrlimit for an arbitrary process?
Not that I absolutely need it, but it would be nice to know if a daemon
really has resource limits in effect.
Couldn't find it under /proc, at least on 2.4.x.
(A 2.4.21-pre4aa3 server just locked up hard rather horrendeously when
SpamAssassin spamd decided to fork a couple of thousand processes... Looks
like I need sprinkle ulimit lines all over /etc/init.d/*.)
