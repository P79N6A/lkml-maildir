an order less than a ~5k .config, instead of bloat like this: 
	# CONFIG_M386 is not set
	# CONFIG_M486 is not set
	# CONFIG_M586 is not set
	# CONFIG_M586TSC is not set
	CONFIG_M686=y
	CONFIG_X86_WP_WORKS_OK=y
	CONFIG_X86_INVLPG=y
	CONFIG_X86_BSWAP=y
	CONFIG_X86_POPAD_OK=y
	CONFIG_X86_TSC=y
it's enough to store:
	EXPERIMENTAL
	M686
	X86_WP_WORKS_OK
	X86_INVLPG
	X86_BSWAP
	X86_POPAD_OK
	X86_TSC
my 7k .config can be stored in 600 bytes plaintext with this method, and i
have compressed it down the 300 bytes with gzip. Storing a stripped down
and gzip-ed .config in the kernel and reporting it to user-space via /proc
doesnt sound like a big overhead, and certainly simplifies/cleans up the
bug reporting process.

.config is a fact of life. I dont agree with your patches idea though,
'production quality patches' outside the main kernel are an artifact of
bad communication. we should _not_ make it easier. People playing with
'experimental patches' should be fully aware of the risks.
