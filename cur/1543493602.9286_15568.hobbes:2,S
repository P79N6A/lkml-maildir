As some other people (Albert Cahalan, for example) pointed out in this
thread, there are reasons for encoding the capability info in a header and
not in the code; for example, this gives _some_ sort of solution for
binary-only programs (even if they are `binary only' just because someone
doesn't want to recompile them...).
But, it seems that it may be a better idea to just change ld.so (instead
of the kernel) to find the capability note and reduce the process's
caps...  It really doesn't belong in the kernel.
Hmm. I'll need to have a look at glibc 2.1's ld.so sometime.
