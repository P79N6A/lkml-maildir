On my Thinkpad X31 with a Radeon Mobility M6 LY I see a major
regression going from 2.6.11-rc3 to rc4. With rc-4, the frame
buffer console (using "video=radeonfb:1024x768-24@60") comes up as
640x480 expanded to 1024x768. The inability of ACPI suspend to turn
off the backlight also returns. Using rc-3, frame buffer console
works fine and suspend/resume appears to work reliably without
needing radeontool to turn off the backlight (as long as I do it
from X.org X).
