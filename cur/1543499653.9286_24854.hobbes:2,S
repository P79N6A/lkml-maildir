Indeed there are tricks that can be done with devfs eg each user could 
only see their devices in their namespace and noone elses. This would
close some possible denial of service schemes
Also the kernel could handle resetting permissions and ownership on
devices based on end-user defined rules. Thus closing some security holes
due to timing attacks
