That is usually memory or motherboard timings. memtest86+ will miss a lot
of problems on these boards for some reason I don't really fathom
although its still a worthwhile test you did
I'd be interested to knowwhat the following do
Bad RAM check:
	Boot with mem= to limit to the bottom 256MB of RAM
	(Windows tends to use different areas of RAM to Linux the most so
	your report fits that)
Stress testing:
	Go into X in a high resoution, starting running a continuous
	copy to or from disk and see if its suddenely much less stable
Disabling power management
