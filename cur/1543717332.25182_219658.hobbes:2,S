Its the single thing which forces users of dnotify to have an otherwise
useless daemon. Signals are process global resources. As such, a library
can't allocate them, so dnotify can't be used in a library.

Hierarchical watches are not important to Nautilus, and the lack of them
has not generally been a problem for Gnome. Furthermore, they are
basically impossible to implement in a way that is sane wrt resource
management in the kernel. Unlimited queues in the kernel is an instant
DOS, and if the queue can overflow there is bascially no way to handle
that correctly from userspace without keeping the entire subtree in
memory (and even that breaks in the presence of aliases).
