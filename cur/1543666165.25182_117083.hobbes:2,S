Correct.

Not throttle logic, we simply have a struct list_head that we stick one 
command (per host) onto and should it ever need to be used, then in 
scsi_done() when we would normally free a command we are done with we 
instead stick it back on that list head.  That way, memory pressure 
can't kill us, just slow us down.

Yep.
