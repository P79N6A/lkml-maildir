I think you've missed a point here.  There are several places where kernel
deals with device identification.
	a) when normal pathname lookup results in a device node on filesystem.
That's the regular way.
	b) when we create a new device node; device number is passed to
->mknod() and new device node is created.  Also a normal codepath.
	c) when late-boot code mounts the final root.  It used to be black
magic, but these days it's done by regular syscalls.  Namely, we parse the
"device name" (most of the work is done by lookups in sysfs), do mknod(2)
and mount(2).  It's still done from the kernel mode, but it could be moved
to userland.  Should be, actually.
	d) when kernel deals with resume/suspend stuff.  Currently - black
magic.  Should be moved to early userland (same parser as for final root
name + mknod on rootfs + open() to get the device in question).
	e) in several pathological syscalls we pass device number to
identify a device.  ustat(2) and its ilk - bad API that can't die.
	f) /dev/raw passes device number to bind raw device to block device.
Bad API; we probably ought to replace it with saner one at some point.
	g) RAID setup - mix of both pathologies; should be done in userland
and interfaces are in bad need of cleanup.
	h) nfsd uses device number as a substitute for export ID if said
ID is not given explicitly.  That, BTW, is a big problem for crackpipe
dreams about random device numbers - export ID _must_ be stable across
reboots.
	i) mtdblk parses "device name" on boot; should be take to early
userland, same as RAID et.al.
	Eventually name_to_dev_t() should be gone from kernel mode
completely - all callers should be shifted to early userland.  But
that will take a lot of work - currently we have a big mess in that
area.
