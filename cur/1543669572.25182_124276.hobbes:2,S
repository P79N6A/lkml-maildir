The mode asked during boot comes from the in-kernel modedb,
the mode passed in by fbset comes from fbset own files
/etc/fb.modes
This is not very consistent, I hope /etc/fb.modes can be
deprecated one day once we have proper mode management in
the kernel, something Tony Dapalas have been working on
lately.
