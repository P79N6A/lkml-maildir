It's certainly come up in mails from other users.  The way to deal with it
in userspace would be for the program to hang around in the background
with the device open until it is no longer needed.  This adds all sorts of
complications when you want to send another command later.
It would be nice if the card would just maintain the same state until
changed by the user.  The radio cards out there are largely brain dead
and they will stay exactly where they are until told otherwise or reset.
fmtools relies on this behavior as you have seen.
