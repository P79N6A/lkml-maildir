I quite agree.  Haven't looked closely yet, but the bad news is that at
least some 2.1 kernels have it too.  I just checked 2.1.130 (SMP kernel,
UP box) and it does it too.  My other 2.1 box is 2.1.131ac10 SMP
kernel/box and I can't use it for tests right now.
Then again, do we care :-)  ?  5% isn't much different to 9% (!).
