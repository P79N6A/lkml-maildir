Yes, that's it.  Never noticed this much with IDE - this is my 
first SATA system.
Just a wishlist that process IO could be monitored.  I hate to 
say it but ctl-alt-esc in W2K can monitor io by process, and 
that's really useful.  (I will never go back though.)
Or is this something that could be reported with the system call 
auditing infrastructure?
