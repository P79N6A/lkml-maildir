Thanks for reminding me about handling PTRACE_DETACH!
Yeah, we could go with PTRACE_SET_IGNORE_SIGNAL (signum), but we'll
still need a sigset_t like structure in struct task_struct {}. I figured
the PTRACE_SET_SIGIGN_MASK interface would be more flexible and
efficient if someone wanted to have the debugger ignore a whole bunch of
signals at once for a debuggee child.
But I agree, the GET interface is perhaps not required.
Okay, I'll whip out a preliminary patch, and you can all rip it apart if
you find issues with it. Stay tuned...
Thanks for your comments, Daniel!
