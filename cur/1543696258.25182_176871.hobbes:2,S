Why not turn it the other way and just report the success of booted
CPUs and more detailed results for the CPUs that failed? I know there
are cases where you want the debug info in case of tracking kernel
bugs, but one could stick a compile time debug flag into the code for
that case, 960 - 40% = 576 lines of guff is still way too much IMHO,
especially over a serial console.
Cheers,
Jes
