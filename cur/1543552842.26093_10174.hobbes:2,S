Subject: [PATCH] fix ambiguous PTRACE_SYSCALL tracing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Linus,
This patch allows a (ptrace) parent to unambiguously distinguish between a
child ptrace stop following a PTRACE_SYSCALL due to a system call and a ptrace
stop due to delivery of a SIGTRAP.
Currently, when PTRACE_SYSCALL is being used, it's not possible to tell for
certain why a particular ptrace stop happens.  The workaround is to check the
"wait channel" of the stopped process, but this is ugly and slow.
This patch is of benefit to all users of PTRACE_SYSCALL (strace, SUBTERFUGUE,
etc).
The new functionality is enabled on a per-child basis by the ptrace'ing
parent, and is disabled by default, thus preserving full backward
compatibility with existing versions of strace.
--Mike
P.S.  Even if you disallow the patch, you may want to look at the first
chunk.  I believe this change was missed when the ptrace flag field was added
recently.
