would be nice to have some of these in the mainstream kernel, if they
are legit bugs. i see one of those patches fixes the timer. nforce2
timer isn't connected to pin0 so it falls back to XT-PIC unless i add
"acpi_skip_timer_override" to the kernel perameters.
2.6.8.1 oops's on me very rarely with something about irq not syncing,
which may be related to some of these nforce2 quirks. 2.6.9 is just a
mess, always freezes on me.
