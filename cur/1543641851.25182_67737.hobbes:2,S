Why bother? It's obvious what it is, and the debate weighs more in terms
of bickering over what the most descriptive possible term is than all the
supposed fluff in terms of diffsize. Just give it an obvious name that
doesn't require so many extraneous characters to type and rest assured
in that this of all things is too obvious to mistake for anything else.
This much time and effort isn't useful to spend explaining or messing with
something as trivial as lists. Let names be short and kill the typedef.
Cheers,
Bill
