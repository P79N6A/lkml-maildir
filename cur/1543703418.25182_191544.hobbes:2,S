Reading port registers directly doesn't make sense. No USB keyboards, no
remote use, ... you need to drop your DOS programming mentaility. Fast.
You can use a PTY approach like script(1), or you can write a small kernel
module like evbug (see the kernel source, drivers/input/evbug.c) which
monitors everything the user is doing.

There are two distinct sorts of what we call bashfulness; this, the
awkwardness of a booby, which a few steps into the world will convert into the
pertness of a cox comb; that, a consciousness, which the most delicate
feelings produce, and the most extensive knowledge cannot always remove.
