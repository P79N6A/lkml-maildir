OK, I think that I finally understand what you are getting at -- and I
agree that it would be interesting to get latency measurements during the
actual lmbench runs.  However, if I understand correctly, you would want
roughly 1,000,000 latency measurements per lmbench run segment, which,
at 1024 Hz, would mean that each segment would take about 20 minutes.
A single lmbench run would then take many hours.
Is this really what you are getting at, or are you instead thinking
in terms of a single maximum-latency measurement covering the entire
lmbench run?
						Thanx, Paul
