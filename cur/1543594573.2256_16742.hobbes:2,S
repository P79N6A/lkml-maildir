if the network goes down in between, the sender may never get the ACK.
the sender will see a timeout eventually.  the receiver may already be
done with the connection and closed it and never see the error.  if it
were a protocol such as SMTP then the sender would retry later, and the
result would be a duplicate message.  (which you can eliminate above the
TCP layer using unique ids.)
