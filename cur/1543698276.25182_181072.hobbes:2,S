OK, I've run XFS through hours and hours of very heavy stress now,
using a variety of different tests, and have tried different mount
and mkfs options as well.  And with a few kernel compiles thrown in
in the background for good measure.  Either we have quite different
hardware configs, compilers, etc; or this is something else.  This
was done with preempt enabled too (which I usually test without).
I'm not seeing anything to suggest random slab corruption, and I'm
so far unable to trip things up as easily as you're able to Jerome.
Do you have just a very small amount of memory perhaps?  I can try
running while very low on memory, but thats the only other obvious
thing I can think of atm.
cheers.
