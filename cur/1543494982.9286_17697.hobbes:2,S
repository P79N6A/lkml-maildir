Sigh... L-k is not a good place for that stuff, but anyway:
a) There is no such thing as text-mode or graphical OS. Kernel is kernel
is kernel.
b) Windows 95 is ugly as hell, but its kernel is not DOS. Take a Sun and
hit L1-A. You'll get what? Exactly. Now look at the SunOS kernel (or
Linux, for that matter). It is not an OpenPROM extender.
c) For all practical purposes Windows *is* in the control of the box. It
controls MMU, it controls context switches and it controls access to the
hardware.
d) "Fast" reboot is fast only because Windows doesn't do fsck. BTW,
writing to disk after oops may be dangerous or not, but dirty reboot
definitely *is* dangerous. So the whole idea looks pretty bogus.
