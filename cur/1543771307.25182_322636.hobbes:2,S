It will be.

Because it's not a block device :) I assume that's common practice to
access low-level devices, isn't it ?

I'd like to keep this of type int because of possible future

Looks reasonable, thank you

I'll consider this during rework

Yup.

I'd rather use pr_debug

Due to historical reasons :) And functional drivers can pput their
public headers to separate directory.

This function will be removed, because its functionality is duplicated by spidev_read/spidev_write.

As devfs is going to become obsolete, maybe just drop all the
devfs-related code?

Well, those two are both simple serial interfaces, so their similarity
is just reflected in driver structures.
