NAK
The core dump locking is now totally unprotected rather than slightly
dubious. This patch needs to go in together with a parallel patch to
actually lock properly. You've made a bug worse not fixed it.
There are cases that updating the corepath name and dumping a core at the
same moment can result in the wrong thing being exec()'d or a file being
opened which is a mix of the old and new name and could go anywhere.
I see two variants on your patch that work
#1	Replace the lock_kernel with a sysctl_update mutex and fix both
paths
#2	Add locking specifically to the corename path
