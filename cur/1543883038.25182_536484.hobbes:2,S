As promised, I tested with a kernel that I know for fact that I have
tested heavy IO on previously, and behavior was identically horrid, so
it's not something new that snuck in ~recently, my disk just got a _lot_
fuller in the meantime (12k mp3s munch a lot).
I also verified that I don't need to use the dirty data restrictions
with ext2, all is just peachy using stock settings.  Amarok switches
songs quickly, and GUI doesn't hang.  Behavior is that expected of a
heavily loaded IO subsystem, and is 1000% better than ext3 with my very
full disk.
Journaling is very nice, but I think I'll be much better off without it
responsiveness wise.
