Yes. [De]compression stuff tends to be (a) totally unpredictable and (b) a 
situation where people care about performance. It's fairly rare in many 
other situations.
That said, any real performance these days is about avoiding cache misses. 
There cmov really can help more, if it results in denser code (fairly big 
if, though).
