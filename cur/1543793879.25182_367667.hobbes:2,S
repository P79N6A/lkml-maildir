menuconfig EMBEDDED

          This option allows certain base kernel options and settings
          to be disabled or tweaked. This is for specialized
          environments which can tolerate a "non-standard" kernel.
          Only use this if you really know what you are doing.
So yes, Matt's patch does make sense.
