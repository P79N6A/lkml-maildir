Con was scratching an itch, one we desktop users all have in a place we 
can't quite reach to scratch because we aren't quite the coding gods we 
should be.  Con at least has the coding knowledge to walk in and start 
shoveling, which is more than I can say of the efforts to derail the SD 
scheduler have demonstrated to this user.

Sorry, this user got quiet to watch the cat fight.  Obviously I should

Who gives a s*** about hackbench or a make -j 200?!  Those are NOT, and 
NEVER WILL BE, REAL WORLD LOADS for the vast majority of us.  For us SD 
Just Worked(TM).

To be expected, there are after all, only so many cpu cycles to go around.  
Here I sit, running 2.6.21-rc6 ATM, and since there is not an SD patch 
that applies cleanly to rc6, I am back to typing half or more of a 
sentence blind while I answer a posting such as this because of x 
starvation while kmail is sorting incoming stuff.
All this while gkrellm, sitting on the right edge of my screen, is showing 
a 0 to 2% cpu usage in its graphic display!  FWIW, also isn't suffering 
the same display update problems, nor is the system clock down on the 
kickstart bar.  If that isn't prima faci evidence of an unfair scheduler, 
I don't know what is. With the SD patch applied to a working kernel, I've 
pretty well got my machine back and I'm in command again, just as if I 
was running nitros9 on my trs-80 Color Computer while it was compiling a 
program in the background, or back when I was doing all this on an amiga.
Both of these had, by their simplistic designs, schedulers that were fair, 
with (nitr)os9 having the ability to schedule the order that IRQ's were 
serviced with a priority setting on a per IRQ basis.  If Amigados ever 
had the ability to fiddle with the scheduler other than niceing the 
process, it wasn't important enough for me to see if I could tweak it 
because generally it simply worked.
Con's earlier patches worked very well for this desktop user, but as Mike 
kept bitching about "production", (who the hell runs a 'make -j 200' or 
50 while(1)'s in the real world? Certainly not this user, who would like 
to think he has more sense than that) and to heck with the users 
experience. Con kept trying to satisfy Mike, so the more recent ones 
(that I was able to apply & test since I was also fighting with the 
device-mapper change) weren't quite the night and day difference the 
earlier ones were for a desktop user.
I thought I made enough noise in favor of Con's approach early on, but you 
two got into what can only be described as a cat fight, with Ingo 
apparently siding with Mike, and Con apparently isn't up to that sort of 
thing either physically, or mentally after the seemingly endless 
criticism from Mike.  And I hate to say it, but Ingo, you weren't a lot 
of help either, the setbatch utility you had me doing in my scripts 
didn't work all that well, returning an error which was its process 
number when incorporated into a script, and still left me without a 
machine for 5 seconds at a time when gzip -best was running in the 
background, all this something I didn't report all that noisily because 
of the unrelated amanda problems I was having post 2.6.20.3.  The SD 
patches, generally speaking, brought this lag into the less than 1 second 
range 90% of the time.
Maybe I wasn't able to give SD vs mainline aspect my full attention 
either, you'll recall that I was, and am, still bouncing around from the 
in-out status of the device-mapper patch.  But, now that I know how to 
handle it (as a startup from square one for amanda) and the reason for 
the patch, I am more than willing to tolerate it if its a one time thing, 
and the amanda users have been advised, but now its been reverted for a 
bit, and will have to go through this particular bit of hassle again 
later.  I disagree with the reversion of that patch on that basis alone.

In this regard, my sympathies Con.  Do get well.  And re-armed for this 
battle.  It is a worthwhile battle, and many thanks from this user to you 
for having fought it.  And I apologize for not supporting your efforts a 
lot more vocally.
