As of 2002-03-06, LANANA's Linux Device Number Registration has resumed.
At the request of Alan Cox and Marcelo Tosatti, new device number
registrations have begun again.  If you submitted a registration request
after May, 2001 and have not received a device assignment, please re-submit
your request if you still need a device number allocated.  We apologize if
this has created an inconvenience for you.  Priority will be given based on
the date of your original request by consulting our email archive.
Please do not submit your request(s) until you are ready to have your
device driver included in one of the Linux kernel source trees, and have
obtained preliminary approval from either Alan, Marcelo or Linus that your
driver will be accepted.  Until that time, please use device numbers from
the local/experimental range.
Also note that I am the new maintainer of the Linux Device List.
H. Peter Anvin remains in an advisory role for device list registration
and will be expanding his duties in the other LANANA areas.
Thanks,
John
