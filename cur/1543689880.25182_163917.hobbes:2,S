Ok. I will keep building clusters and the code that makes them work, and you can dream.
I backed up my assertion, and can do even better. 
I have already built a 2304 cpu machine and am working on a 2900+ cpu
machine.  
The software stack and that part of the idea are reasonable but your
target hardware is just plain rare, and expensive.  
If you don't get the commodity OS on commodity hardware thing, I'm sorry.
The thing is for all of your talk of Dell, Dell doesn't make the hardware you
need for a CC cluster.  And because the cc NUMA interface requires a
manufacturer to make chips, and boards, I have a hard time seeing 
cc NUMA hardware being a commodity any time soon.
