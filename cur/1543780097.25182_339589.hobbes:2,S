I still don't like this fix. Yes, you're right, it should eventually
give up. But here it gives up way too easily - 5 could easily
translate to 5 microseconds. This is analogous to giving up on serial
transmit if CTS is down for 5 loops.
I'd be much happier if there were some udelay or the like in here so
that we're not giving up on such a short timeframe.
