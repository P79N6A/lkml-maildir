Any new implementation first needs to prove that it is durable and (more 
important) that it is actively maintained. I am sure that this kind of software 
will never handle all oddities in drive firmware we know from CD/DVD-writers.

I know this person, but Sun is creating reliable software for customers and for 
this reason, it is most unlikely that an incompatible change like this will 
be intregrated before Solaris 11 GA is available to the end of 2007.
It may appear earlier in Solaris 11 beta's, but this is a different thing.

I hope that Sun will not base Sun's implementations on ideas on the Linux 
implementaion which is known to be an "unfriendly" program as it causes 
problems with CD/DVD-writing.
Since 1992, Sun has vold and vold is rock solid. Vold nicely coexists with 
cdrecord in the right way: It does not send inapropriate SCSI commnds to the 
drives and it does not send too many of them in a certain period of time.
