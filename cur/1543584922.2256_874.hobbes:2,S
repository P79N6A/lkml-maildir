Then they would be legitimate devices and you would do:
echo "scsi-add-single-device a b c d" > /proc/scsi/scsi
to add them to the device chain.  Before then, they aren't anything (at least
not in the case of the Clariion array).

Patches welcomed.  The one I sent already works on a fiber channel setup (the
qla2x00 in question is fc and so is the Clariion array it's connected to, no
detrimental side effects from scanning the box) and so I'm not inclined to add
a REPORT LUNs section to the code unless absolutely necessary.
