Also, have a look at the hostfs filesystem in UML.  It implements a virtual 
filesystem which provides access to the host filesystems from inside the 
virtual machine.  The userspace side of it is basically trivial to implement 
and can be used to provide filesystem access to anything on the host that can 
be made to look like a filesystem.
See 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/user-mode-linux/linux/arch/u
m/fs/hostfs/hostfs_user.c?rev=1.11&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup for 
the interface that you'd have to implement.
