I use kmail (KDE mail program).  I just looked at the full headers, and
majordomo is only listed in the X-Loop header tag.  It must be a
problem with kmail because every reply to all I make automatically
includes the majordomo address.  I have to remember to delete it or
it gets included as a CC.  I'll look into it with Sven Radej, who
appears to be the mail kmail developer.  I didn't see any existing bug
reports on this.  In the mean time I'll try and remember to delete it...
