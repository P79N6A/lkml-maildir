Ya is 2.6.9, has uml-skas patch also but that doesn't touch swap_state.c
Ah, I see I think, radix_tree_node_alloc first calls kmem_cache_alloc
with root->gfp_mask and only if this fails dips into the preloaded
percpu node stash. Perhaps root->gfp_mask has !__GFP_NOWARN
Shouldn't it use the preloaded nodes that have been reserved anyway.
