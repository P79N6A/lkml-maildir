Hope so.  My Friday-night-notfix wouild have survived that long :(

Not really ;)
There still seems to be a window where blk_run_queues() will
assume the queue is on local_plug_list while not holding
plug_list_lock.  The QUEUE_PLUGGED flag is set, so blk_stop_queue()
will remove the queue from local_plug_list.  Then blk_run_queues()
removes it as well.  The new list_head debug code will rudely
catch that.
I'd be more comfortable if the duplicated info in QUEUE_FLAG_PLUGGED
and "presence on a list" were made fully atomic/coherent via
blk_plug_lock?
