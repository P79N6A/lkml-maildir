Actually, what is undefined is shifting with the size of the data type or higher.
If the cast of uci->mc->bits had been an uint64_t (unsigned long
long), >> 32 would have been perfectly well-defined.
The above code is just plain wrong: the cast to (unsigned long) has
higher precedence than the shift, so on i386 (which I presume this is)
it will become an unsigned long, and the shifts will bring it down to
zero.
You might as well write zero if that's what you mean.
