Hello,
Apologies for using this address. My normal one is on a different computer 
and I seem to have forgotten my password. Responses here are okay though. 
(But cc: jpranevich@linuxtoday.com)
I have written a quick hack of sorts to the serial driver (serial.c) to 
support autodetection of PnP boards. I have tested it on my mnachine, in 
fact I'm using it now. It only detects my card at present, we would need to 
build a list of supported devices. (I believe that there is a generic "PNP" 
device classes for modems, but not all seem to adhere to it -- mine 
doesn't.) At present, I've only tested it in a machine where all serial 
devices were PnP. I expect it to function properly elsewhere however.
Major limitation: we're using the PnP configuration routines exclusively. 
That means that it doesn't know about IRQ sharing... maybe a major 
limitation to some people.
Minor limitation: we are adding devices based on an arbitrary order. It may 
be smarter to add cards in bus order. (we would have to bypass the find card 
routines and whatnot and I didn't feel that that was necessary for sample 
code)
In any case, here's the beginnings of something against 2.3.16's serial.c. 
I'm going to defer to the maintainer (Theodore Ts'o?) but since I'm not 
positive who that is, this is going to a wider than intended audience. If I 
am asked (by the maintainer or someone else, or maybe even if I feel bored), 
I would be more than happy to add the autoconfiguration support and support 
for more modems later.
Of course, since I haven't been able to read my mail in most of a week, 
someone might have added this support already. Oh well. :)
Later,
Joe Pranevich
