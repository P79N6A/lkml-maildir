Applying the patch by hand, you forgot a piece, try to apply the patch
to a clean, unmodified 2.6.6 sis900.c.
Also, did you try to boot with the network cable plugged in ? The
probing code has special case for transciever with link status on.
If you want to try this, please use an unpatched kernel.
Thanks for testing.
