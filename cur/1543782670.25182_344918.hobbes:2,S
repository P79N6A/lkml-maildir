If there is a notifier, I presume we can track it.  We might want to 
refine things so as to not hit too big a bump when the shift occures, 
but I think it is doable.  The desirability of doing it, I think, 
depends on the availablity of something better.  The access time of the 
TSC is "really" enticing.  Even so, I think a _good_ clock would not 
depend on long term accuracy of something as fast as the TSC.  Vendors 
are even modulating these to reduce RFI, but still, because of its 
speed, it makes the best interpolator for the jiffie to jiffie times.
