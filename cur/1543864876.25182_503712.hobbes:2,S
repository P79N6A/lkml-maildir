We've been building MTD stuff on 64-bit machines since about 1999, when
I first put a DiskOnChip in an ISA eval board in an Alpha. 
The _problematic_ 32-bit assumption in MTD code is the fact that device
size is limited to 4GiB. That used to be "insanely large" in the context
of flash chips, but it's not so any more. We'll have to deal with that
soon enough.

Nak. %Zd is a gratuitous GNUism. In C, we use %zd.
Artem (dedekind) is the correct person to deal with UBI stuff. I've
added him to Cc.
