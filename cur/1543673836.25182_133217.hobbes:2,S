from you, whose feeble cries incite, you troll,
I heed no words, and pay no mind or thought.
Your post, if jest, is neither funny nor droll,
And no one's seen what good you may have wrought.
McVoy, if arsed, could answer this flamebait
But no one but you could give a rat's ass
If anyone should answer your complaint.
The tactic is transparent, much too crass.
So stop this thread right now, I beg of you.
There are enough trolls as it is, I say.
There's too much noise on here already too
And we'd rather not have you here to stay.
Each time another troll bleats or goes "honk",
I add to my .procmailrc *plonk*
