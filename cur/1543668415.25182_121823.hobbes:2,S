Subject: [PATCH] Filesystem aio rdwr patchset
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Have taken a first pass at implementing the write path
for filesystem aio. 
Attached as a response to this mail is the full 
patchset for filesystem aio (retry based model) including 
read and write paths.
01aioretry.patch : this is the common generic aio
  retry code
02aiordwr.patch  : this is the filesystem read+write
  changes for aio using the retry model
03aiobread.patch : code for async breads which can
  be used by filesystems for providing async get block 
  implementation
04ext2-aiogetblk.patch :  an async get block 
  implementation for ext2
I would really appreciate comments and review feedback 
from the perspective of fs developers especially on
the latter 2 patches in terms of whether this seems a 
sound approach or if I'm missing something very crucial
(which I just well might be)
Is this easy to do for other filesystems as well ?
Regards
Suparna
