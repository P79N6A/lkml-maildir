I wonder if this is related to my laptop problems?  Basically with
2.2.x, my laptop will boot with the keyboard frozen (no sysRq) if I
have gpm start at boot time (mouse type, you guessed it - ps2).  The
computer is still running fine, and can operate over the network.  If
I tap a key during boot (wierdly enough).  It works fine.
I suspect that the ps2 driver and/or keyboard driver are buggy here,
and have been since at least late 2.1 (that's when I first got my
laptop).
Do you see this behaviour with 2.2 ?
