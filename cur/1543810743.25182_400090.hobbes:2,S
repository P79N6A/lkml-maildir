Hi Greg,
Thanks for comments.

I'll move them out to gendisk/hd_struct creation with proper
release function.
I thought it's correct because NULL release function is
just ignored in kobject_cleanup() and it let outside function
to release the whole structure.
But it seems wrong to embed these additional kobjects in
the structures which are logically separate from them.

OK, I'll change them to kobject_unregister() and do it
when gendisk/hd_struct is removed.
Then we can avoid possible memory allocation in dm's atomic
operation, too.
