Reasonable. However, there is an impressive collection of bug-reports on
interaction between ide-scsi and other ide drivers giving exactly the same
mess that Andre got with this patch and I really wonder if this is due to
bad ordering of ide and scsi initializations. I'm less than happy about
the look of ide_init() - look at it yourself and check the usage of
'initialized' in drivers/block/ide.c ;-/ It seems that we are kludging
around some dependency problems here. I would really appreciate if
somebody familiar with upper layers of ide subsystem and with ide-scsi
would comment on situation.
