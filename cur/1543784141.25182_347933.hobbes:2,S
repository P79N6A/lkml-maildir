No, this approach is not feasible because it would be require to 
describe the entire computer in SystemC: it's extremly complex to do and 
the simulation will be very slow.
 From what I understand Màrius tries to only simulate one component 
(like a PCI card). As suggested Muli, a plugin to something like quemu 
sounds like a good idea?
