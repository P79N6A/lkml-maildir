I think the fact that it is highly architecture specific is relevant. I
have no way of testing spufs changes except on cell, no? And if I am
developing on a cell, I probably will notice it in arch/ all the same.
So I don't quite buy your the maintenace argument.
But as Arnd said, there are no clear rules on what kind of filesystems
should go into fs/ so please do whatever you must.
