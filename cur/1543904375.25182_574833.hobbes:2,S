Wrong. It is quite safe to test the structure member ctx->list for
emptiness outside the spinlock because we have an explicit guarantee
that nobody else has a reference to this structure, plus the
atomic_dec_and_test() in kref_put() has acted as a memory barrier for
us.

Huh? We're freeing the context. It will _never_ _ever_ _ever_ be used
again. If anything tries to use ctx->list after this, then that is a
major bug.
Patch rejected...
