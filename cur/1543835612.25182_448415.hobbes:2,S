Greg, once we put an interface into the kernel and expose it to userspace,
that's it - we support it forever.  At least, that's the model.  Yes,
sometimes in cases of necessity where we cannot feasibly support old
userspace we'll break things, with long notice and considerable thought
and care.
The impact is lower in this case because we've already trained our
long-suffering users to expect udev to regularly break.

Please stop going on about FC3.  My (repeat) point is that we're proposing
to break _all_ distros which are older than ten months.  We don't play the
"oh, that isn't supported any more" game.

This sucks.  Do you know what machines we'll be breaking out there?  I
sure don't.
