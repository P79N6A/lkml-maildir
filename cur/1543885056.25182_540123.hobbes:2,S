Previous subjects were like:
[PATCH 00/20] vm deadlock avoidance for NFS, NBD and iSCSI (take 7)
A URL doesn't allow for true discussion about a particular patch
unless the reviewer takes the initiative to create a new thread to
discuss the Nth patch it a patchset; whereby taking on the burden of a
structured subject and so on.  It would get out of control on a large
patchset that actually got a lot of simultaneous feedback... reviewers
don't have a forum to talk about each individual change without
stepping on each others' toes.

The _suggestions_ in Documentation/SubmittingPatches are nice and all
but the quantity of patches shouldn't _really_ matter.
Documentation/SubmittingPatches actually doesn't cover how to post a
large change because it first states:
"Separate _logical changes_ into a single patch file."
then:
"If you cannot condense your patch set into a smaller set of patches,
then only post say 15 or so at a time and wait for review and integration."
These suggestions conflict in the case of a large patchset: the second
can't be met if you honor the first (more important suggestion IMHO).
Unless you leave something out... and I can't see the value in leaving
out the auxiliary consumers of the core changes.
Reviewing 10 patches that are quite large/overloaded is actually
harder than 40 broken-out/well-documented patches.  But maybe others
disagree.
