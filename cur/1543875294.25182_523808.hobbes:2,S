okay, but please explain how that what you call
'resource management' is different from the resource
accounting and resource limits used in Linux-VServer
(and please ignore the implementation details :)

well, I totally agree here, the _container_ should bear
the cost, but not the entire system! 
I'm fine (and I mentioned that several times) with
penalizing Guests which are over limit either in general
or on the actual resource access, but IMHO it is a very
bad idea to hurt the entire system like a partitioning
system would do ...

IMHO it is the basis for resource management, if you cannot
account the used resources, you will not be able to limit
them in a proper way, no?

there are two different kinds of resource, the ones you
basically 'give' on request and the ones which are 'taken'
when there is need. the former ones can easily be checked
with some limit and simply be denied when crossing over.
the latter ones should IMHO penalize the Guest in such way
that the 'good' Guests are not affected or even benefit 
from the 'bad' ones ...
This, IMHO is the real challenge in OS-level isolation
and virtualization ... YMMV

maybe, but for example, saying that we can only have
128 limited Guests, because all you ever will have is like
a dozen 'partitions' makes the entire approach quite useless
for the typical scenarios Linux-VServer and OpenVZ is used 
for ... note: we have users with 300+ limited Guests on
larger machines ....
