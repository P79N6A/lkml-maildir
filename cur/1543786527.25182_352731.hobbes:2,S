You are totaly correct and I apologize for that, the last thing I want 
to do is increase the noise level.  I spent several hours trying to get 
netconsole to work with this, but I spose it just happens to soon. Im 
getting an oops now. (The oops was happening a week or so ago when I 
first tried to upgrade from .12 to .13 by simply using make oldconfig 
and going from there, then I started poking around and eventualy the 
drive worked but with no dma)  Attached is my current oops generating 
config. Here is a digicam shot of my screen:

Again my drive is a:
LITE-ON DVDRW SOHW-1693S, FwRev=KS09 
And my IDE chip is a:
VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586A/B/VT82C686/A/B/VT823x/A/C/VT8235 PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 06)
Thanks!
