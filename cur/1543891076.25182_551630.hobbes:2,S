Aha, I missed the word "thread", this is the single process.
Still, this means that flush_workqueue() completes when other sub-threads go away,
otherwise the thread doing ioctl() couldn't exit.
Thank you very much.
So, the main question is: is it possible that one of RT processes/threads pins itself
to some CPU and eats 100% cpu power?

Could you send me this output? just in case...

I do not understand floppy.c, absolutely, so I am not sure this patch is correct.
Even if correct, this patch doesn't solve this problem (if we really understand
what's going on). cancel_work_sync() may still hang if floppy_work->func() runs
on the starved CPU. This is unlikely, but possible.
Thanks!
Oleg.
