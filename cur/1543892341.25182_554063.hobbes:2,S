Right, my point is the source of the backport is in -mm for maybe as
long as 6 weeks but not in Linus' tree.  I s'pose it's chicken and egg
for the ida code.  I'd prefer to see your patch upstream, and Tejun's
code becomes the ida code plus conversion of the simple counter to ida
at some later point in time.
