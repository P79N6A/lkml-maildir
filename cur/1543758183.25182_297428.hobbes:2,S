It is not just counting the number of tasks. It helps the user to manage
and monitor it, which one can use to do accounting, planning etc.,
But, we get your point. will look into it.

Current controllers we have are very different from each other(because of

That makes sharing hard.
We do have plan to make one of the function common.
