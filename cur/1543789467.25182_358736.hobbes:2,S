If you go look, you will notice that all of those built-in.o are zero 
bytes large.  We've already fixed this in kernel 2.6.14 by preventing 
the build of these empty units with the following patch (you can safely 
apply it to 2.6.13.y):
Don't build empty built-in.o when DVB/V4L is not configured.
Thanks to Sam Ravnborg and Keith Owens.
