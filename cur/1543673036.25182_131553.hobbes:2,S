You are right, if operations occur in the sequence above.
What are your thoughts on the following two
A)
	long wrapper_call(args) {
		yield(random(threshold)); /* yeild is a sleep */
		rv = orig_syscall(args...);
		copy_from_user(audit_data,args...);
		audit_log(audit_data);
		return rv;
	}
That becomes a bit more difficult to time, because the attacker doesn't
know when the system call will actually perform its own copy_from_user vs.
return vs. the audit's copy_from_user, If the correct upper threshold for
each system call is picked timing attacks can be made alot harder.
B)
	long wrapper_call(args) {
		yield(random(threshold));
		copy_from_user(audit_data1,args...);
		rv = orig_syscall(args...);
		yield(random(threshold));
		copy_from_user(audit_data2,args...);
		audit_log(audit_data1);
		audit_log(audit_data2);
		return rv;
	}
Suspicious data analysis is then performed by a user-land tool to
further ensure integrity.
I would just like to say that above does not pretend to be speed happy,
still for practical purposes you can assume that the yield is a lot
shorter (a couple of orders of magnitude) than the duration of the system
call.
Cheers,
Ahmed.
