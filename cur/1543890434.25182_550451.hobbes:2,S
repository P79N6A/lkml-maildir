Thanks, that's enough and helpful.  It was just becuase currently we
have a HG tree containing only ALSA portion and a git tree for the
merge, and above all, because I have no control over the latter git
tree...

Well, I find the change of CONFIG_SND to menuconfig is fine, too.
But CONFIG_SND_PCI_DRIVERS and others don't make much sense to me.
How is it useful at all?
Anyway, I'd like to confirm that this really works before merging to
the ALSA tree.  As Mauro suspected, kconfig seems not working as
expected...
thanks,
Takashi
