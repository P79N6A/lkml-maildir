As well as allocating the areas on separate cachelines and packing it
all together so you dont waste 1 cacheline minus a small amount times
NR_CPUS of memory, on NUMA boxes we will allocate the areas from local
memory.
Oh yeah we can also do some tricks to make the address generation
slightly quicker (eg we will probably dedicate r13 to be a pointer
to the start of the per cpu area on ppc64).
