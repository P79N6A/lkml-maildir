It can reduce readability of the code [unless it is used in error path
simplification, kfree(something) usually suggests kfree-an-object].
If the caller passes NULL most of the time, it could be in need of
redesign.
I don't actually like kfree(NULL) any time except error paths. It is
subjective, not crazy talk.
