I manage to get access to another PPC64 box that has uses this same
driver and was unable to reproduce this problem here, but I was able to
reproduce it on another same model machine.  Seem like there could be
something at initialization that only affects this revision of the SCSI
adapter.  Since the problem seems to disappear after a BUS RESET I assume
that something was left out when the driver was initializing the adapter.
Any Ideas?
Thanks
