Here is what I have in 'drivers/pci/pci.ids' :
         2500  82820 820 (Camino) Chipset Host Bridge (MCH)
                 1043 801c  P3C-2000 system chipset
         2501  82820 820 (Camino) Chipset Host Bridge (MCH)
                 1043 801c  P3C-2000 system chipset
         250b  82820 820 (Camino) Chipset Host Bridge
         250f  82820 820 (Camino) Chipset PCI to AGP Bridge
So I guess that 0x2500 and 0x2501 should be initialized in the same way, 
through the same routines. Unfortunately, I dont have such a machine to 
test... Can you send what 'lspci -ev' shows ?

It worked, but in which way ? Did you test X+OpenGL apps to see whether 
it did the trick ? The fact that the module loads itself is not always 
sufficient to say that it works (believe me :-)

With your custom patch, or with the 'generic' stuff ?
