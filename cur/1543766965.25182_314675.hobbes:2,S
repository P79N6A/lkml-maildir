Thanks, Lee.
The patch survived on many fsx test over 20 hours on a 2cpu machine.
Tested the patch on the same machine with tiobench (1-64 threads), and
untar a kernel tree test, no regression there.
However I see about 5-7% throughput drop on dbench with 16 threads. It
probably due to the cpu cost that we have discussed.
