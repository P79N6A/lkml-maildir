Hi,
Could anyone please explain the major changes to the ppp module from
2.4.1 to 2.4.3? I've noticed that ppp performance isn't as fast as it
was using 2.4.1, and after a week using 2.4.3 i've concluded that ppp is
definitely slower. I've looked at the ppp_* files but so far the only
changes i saw were ppp_cleanup() being made static, and a new line added
to ppp_generic.c. Perhaps the major changes are in the rest of the
network code?
Adrian
