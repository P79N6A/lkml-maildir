There's an active thread on netdev about implementing an RCU hash.
I'd suggest a 2-left (or possibly even k-left) hash for statistical
reasons discussed briefly there, and in greater depth in a paper by
Michael Mitzenmacher at
www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/NEWWORK/postscripts/iproute.ps.
Despite his paper's emphasis on hardware parallelism, there's a bigger
win associated with Poisson statistics and decreasing occupation
fraction (and therefore collision probability) in successive hashes.
Cheers,
- Michael
