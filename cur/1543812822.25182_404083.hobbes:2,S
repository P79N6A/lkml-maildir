inodes are allocated once and never moved.  We're talking about initial
allocation.  So even though files have their inodes allocated near
their parent directory's inode, their inode is not moved when moved to
another directory.
The reason, as Andreas said, is that if we did allocate directory inodes
near their parent inode, we would end up just filling up from the start
of the drive and never spreading out.
