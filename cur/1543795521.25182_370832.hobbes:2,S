During the past 2 years we have also changed our HW configuration
regarding SCSI from Adaptec to LSI. Always patching the kernel (2.2.x
and 2.4.x) with gibbs' code was too cumbersome and on top of that we
experienced similar interrupts and I/O aborts. Not being too familiar
with indepth SCSI technology we had to go with what proved (seemed) to
work more reliable in the long term, which were LSI based SCSI controllers.

More related to LSI, but would you be willing to try following for me
and report back (in private, since this is getting off-topic), please:
http://www.drugphish.ch/~ratz/mpt-status/mpt-status-1.1.4.tar.bz2
And if it does not compile on your 2.4.x system, use the following patch:
http://www.drugphish.ch/~ratz/mpt-status/mpt-status-1.1.4-fix-compilation-on-2.4.x-1.diff
It should allow you to do basic HW raid monitoring on LSI-53C1030 chipsets.
Thanks and good luck,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
