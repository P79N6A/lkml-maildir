Not to step on toes, but...  From what I can tell the idea is to add code
into FB that calles functions in the DRM and vice vers.  This would seam
to  add another ABI.  Unless the code gets linked into one module, this
idea has been flamed and killed already.
I would be willing to bet that if some one did this, into one module, it
would be exepted by all.  However I don't see why we can't add multi-head
support, posibly at the same time? -Since Joe seams so willing to do this,
why not let him.
