This looks strange. Please either drop the parenthesis from PREFETCH_PAGES or
make it a real static inline function.

Should this be put in mm/page_alloc.c? It is, after all, a special-purpose
page allocator. That way you wouldn't have to export zone_statistics and
buffered_rmqueue.

This could perhaps use a three-state enum as return value. I find return value
checks in kprefetchd() slightly confusing.
