https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/phil-list/2003-January/000413.html
lists what sources are needed for the latest nptl.
Phoebe beta had a slightly earlier snapshot of nptl and glibc.
As far as the kernel goes, it's rumored
( 
https://listman.redhat.com/pipermail/phil-list/2003-January/000419.html
 )
that you're better off using a recent 2.5 kernel than the 2.4 backport
in phoebe.
I haven't tried NPTL myself, though, so what do I know...
