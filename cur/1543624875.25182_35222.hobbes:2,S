i believe the next debian (after the one currently stabilizing for
release) has "real" use of capabilities as a major goal although that
was hearsay and may be entirely false.  the amount of work involved is
not insignificant
it'd certainly be a good thing to see.  after all these years of slowly
converting things to use CAP_SYS_* instead of uid==0 i certainly don't
want that effort to be wasted.
