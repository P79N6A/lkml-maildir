Imagine that the device isn't plugged in when modprobe is run, but is 
plugged in later.
Imagine that the device is plugged in when modprobe is run, but some 
intermediate device (for example a USB hub) is not working, so when you 
correct if the device appears.
There are many more scenarios where true hotplug-based initialization 
makes more sense than otherwise.
