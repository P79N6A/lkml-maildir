2.6.24-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

patch b1aa5301b9f88a4891061650c591fb8fe1c1d1da in mainline.
The proc net rewrite had a side effect on selinux, leading it to mislabel
the /proc/net inodes, thereby leading to incorrect denials.  Fix
security_genfs_sid to ignore extra leading / characters in the path supplied
by selinux_proc_get_sid since we now get "//net/..." rather than "/net/...".
