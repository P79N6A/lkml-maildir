I believe that wouldn't work because the ntfs code using KM_BIO_IRQ is in
the asynchronous i/o completion handler during which time KM_BH_IRQ may
well be in use. At least I don't think it is worth the risk using it...
Have a look at what the ntfs code does in
fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_end_buffer_async_read() for example.

Cool, but the patch is for 2.4.20... But thanks for the pointer. Once
2.4.21 is out we will move to them. That will make the 2.4.x and 2.5.x
drivers more simillar at the same time. (-: Once the iget5_locked()
patches go in the drivers will become almost identical which will be very
cool...
Best regards,
