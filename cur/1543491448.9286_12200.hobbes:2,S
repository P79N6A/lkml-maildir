My fix I sent to you after I discovered clearly where your kernel was
lockingup, still make no sense to me even if my paranoid instinct moved me
in developing such fix ;). I'll go into that again now (I didn't had the
time in the last days to debug it) in order to understand _why_ it fixed
the bug ;)).
