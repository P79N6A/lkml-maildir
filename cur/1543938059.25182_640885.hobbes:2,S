My apologies, it is my mess.  The one in drivers/lguest/Kconfig is the old
(bogus) one: looks like I lost the removal part in a patch merge back in
September.
I've tested this patch.  It correctly handles Ingo's config (removes lguest
guest support).  Both lguest and lguest guest support can be turned on
independently, and it still compiles.
How embarrassing,
Rusty.

Remove bogus duplicate CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST entry.
It was moved to arch/x86/lguest/Kconfig, but I lost the deletion part in a
patch suffle.  My confused one-liner "fix" to turn it on is also reverted:
