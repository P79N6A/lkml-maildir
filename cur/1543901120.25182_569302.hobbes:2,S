If there are exactly two free pages in the system, the odds of them
being buddies (ie adjacent AND properly aligned) is quite small. The
available page pool has to grow quite a bit before the availability of
order-1 page pairs approaches 100%. 
So if we fail to allocate an 8k stack when we could have allocated a
4k stack, we're almost certainly failing significantly prematurely.
As I've pointed out before, it's fairly easy to make our stack
growable with a trampoline in the troublesome paths. Something like:
int growstack(int headroom, int func, void *data)
{
	void *new_stack;
	int ret;
	if (likely(available_stack() > headroom))
		return func(data);
#ifdef CONFIG_GROWSTACK_STATS
	/* gather statistics about stack-heavy paths */
#endif
	/* warn/abort if we're recursing too deeply */
	new_stack = get_free_page();
	switch_to_new_stack(new_stack);
	ret = func(data);
	cleanup_stack(new_stack);
	return ret;
}
