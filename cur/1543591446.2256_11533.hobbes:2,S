I think I suffer from the same problem. The machine was stable with
2.4.2-ac6 until I started playing with smbfs and hit a bug in that. 
So I upgraded to 2.4.4 and since then the machine has been very unstable.
Maximum uptime so far is 4 days and then it fell over.
And I'm using an rtl8139 card too.
I don't have a monitor attached to the machine but I'm compiling
2.4.4-ac10 (afraid of the LVM changes in -ac11) with the kmsgdump patch so
I'll probably get a stackdump sometime later today.
