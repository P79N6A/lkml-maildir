any particular reason?  and note that it's currently *not* in
arch/frv/Kconfig.debug -- it's hard-coded with a macro name that's not
the same as the config option, and i don't really see the advantage of
having each architecture implement precisely the same feature in
different and incompatible ways.  but i'm willing to be convinced
otherwise.
