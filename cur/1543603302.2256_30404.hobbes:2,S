True. We have discussed the idea of placing the fonts into video memory
instead of system memory if the graphics card has room. At first I didn't
like the idea since handling scrolling would become more difficult. It can
be done tho with enough "tricks". I think it should be up to the driver
write where he/she can place the font image. This case drawimage becomes
copyarea except you grabbing off screen data. I have some thinking about
how to handle that.
