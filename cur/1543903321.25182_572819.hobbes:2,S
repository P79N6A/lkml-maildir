What I meant was:
iirc he first had a "very complex" patchkit in -mm* (the one 
with multiple predictors working together); then that got then replaced
with a simpler easier to review one and now he's feeding the stuff from
the complex one piece by piece back.
Just pointed out that the newer stuff was likely already in -mm* for some
time, just before one of the simplifications.
But I guess more testing cannot hurt anyways.
Anyways it's good we're finally making forward progress on this. It has 
the potential for real nice performance gains.
