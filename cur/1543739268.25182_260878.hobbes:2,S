_interrupts_. The latency tracer does traces like:
 00000002 0.022ms (+0.000ms): mark_page_accessed (zap_pte_range)
 00000002 0.022ms (+0.000ms): page_remove_rmap (zap_pte_range)
 00000002 0.022ms (+0.000ms): free_page_and_swap_cache (zap_pte_range)
 00000002 0.022ms (+0.001ms): put_page (zap_pte_range)
 00010002 0.023ms (+0.000ms): do_IRQ (zap_pte_range)
 00010002 0.023ms (+0.000ms): do_IRQ (<00000000>)
 00010003 0.024ms (+0.004ms): mask_and_ack_8259A (do_IRQ)
 00010003 0.029ms (+0.000ms): redirect_hardirq (do_IRQ)
 00010000 0.029ms (+0.000ms): handle_IRQ_event (do_IRQ)
and i just pointed out why i didnt use relayfs.
