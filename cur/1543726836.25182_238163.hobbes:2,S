So is the only solution to disallow user access to the device? 
Operationally that is inconvenient in some cases, but every user 
community has a few ill-intentioned people, and student groups may be 
somewhat heavy on that. Security is more important than convenience, but 
both are desirable.
We could go to burning all local reference data on CD-R instead of 
CD-RW, have a separate CD-R drive, but as noted all of those are 
undesirable drains on time and money. Clearly having some twit rewite 
the CD-RW with their own information is even more undesirable, if that 
wasn't clear ;-)
