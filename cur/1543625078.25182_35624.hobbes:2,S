Well, what we're doing in PPC-land is we've got one tree, 'linuxppc-2.5'
which is linux-2.5 + for-linus-ppc* trees + hacks/fixes for current
problems.  So when we do any work you make a clone of a linux-2.5 tree
to work in, a clone of the linuxppc-2.5 tree (to pull your work tree
into and then test).  Once things are good in the linux-2.5-work tree,
you pull that into a for-linus tree and tell linus to merge that.
