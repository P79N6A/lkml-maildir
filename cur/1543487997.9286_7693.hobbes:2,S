this one looks like a place that relies on the 'old' behavior of
sleep_on*? We go into interruptible_sleep_on() with interrupts disabled,
and if sleep_on() write-locks on waitqueue_lock, another CPU read-locks
waitqueue_lock and is interrupted, then that IRQ or bh deadlocks, boom.
this might explain the hang Christoph is seeing. 
this also means that it's completely illegal to do sleep_on* with
interrupts disabled ... have i missed something?
