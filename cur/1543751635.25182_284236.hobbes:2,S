I agree, it's still a hack, just a generic and complete hack ;-)

It sure should, but I guess they can reply on that.

I saw Jack (I think) post some numbers showing that it wasn't enough.
What about making priority level protected via rlimit?
Here's an uncompiled, untested patch doing that (probably has some math
error or logic hole in it, but idea seems sound enough).  I think it has
at least one problem, where nice 19 process, could renice itself back to
0.  And it doesn't really handle the different scheduling policies,
other than implicit 40 - 139 being used for SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR.
It takes the 140 priority levels (0-139), inverts their priority
order, and then uses that number as the basis for the rlimit (so that a
larger rlimit means higher priority, to fall inline with normal rlimit
semantics).  Defaults to 19 (which should be niceval of 0).  And allows
CAP_SYS_NICE to continue to override if the rlimit is too low.
