Which Universe driver did you use? 
There are several floating around, mine among them. I plan to port 
it to 2.6, time permitting but I'm a bit worried by the size of the 
kernel these days. I have to run diskless systems with 16MB of RAM, 
my 2.2 kernels are about 800kB while the 2.6 kernels on my Mac are 
in the 5MB or more range. Even after removing USB, ext3 and a few 
other things, the 2.6.x kernel will be at least twice the size of 
the 2.2 series it seems.
With my Universe driver or anything derived from it, the thing to 
watch out for is the PCI memory space allocation, 2.2 simply did 
not have the support (it mostly used the thing as the BIOS/firmware
had configures it) and the Universe is a PCI mmio space hog with
base registers outside the standard PCI header space (there are 
valid reasons for both of these characteristics).

I'm already using wait_event_ and friends in my 2.2 drivers,
you should select a better example ;-)
