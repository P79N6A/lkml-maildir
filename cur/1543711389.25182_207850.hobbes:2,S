Iff it is a _pointer_. If it needs a full struct, this won't work. And if
it is a pointer, a simple:
  int foo(struct bar *);
will do for prototype, even if struct bar hasn't been mentioned earlier.
In case the struct is really needed, it is better just to ensure the
respective .h are included in the right order, not nest them.
