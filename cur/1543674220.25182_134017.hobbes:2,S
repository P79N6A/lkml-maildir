It;s not about using RH. At all. You obviously didn't read
my mail. First you say "nobody is doing the work" to which I respond
"I am, and you even don't have to use RH to benifit from it".

For the header set I maintain, I did. Based on the criterium "does
this describe a kernel<->userland ABI".

You really don't get it. 
If a userspace app needs something REALLY special from headers, it
should bloody well come with that header.

Ok to take your example: the wireless extension using apps
should include THEIR header for the extensions THEIR released userland
is for, unless they want to use the sanitized headers (which should have
latest). The kernel<->userspace ABI is stable, and compatible between
kernel versions.

I tried several times to tell you, you just don't want to hear the answer
it seems.
