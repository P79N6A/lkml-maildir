Why not just shutdown the NIC inside spin_lock_irqsave or disable_irq, 
and then free_irq separately?
If you can't stop the NIC hardware from generating interrupts, that's a 
driver bug.  And if the driver cannot handle its interrupt handler 
between the spin_unlock_irqrestore() and free_irq() (shared irq case), 
it's also buggy.
