I saw this prob when my boot device/partition in the bootloader config
was wrong or the filesystem of my root partition is not compiled as a
kernel image rather compiled as module, so plz try to solve this prob
by selecting your desired filesystem in kernel configuration as Y
rather than M ...... I hope this will work

Upgrading from 2.4.xx kernel series to 2.6.xx series what I found is
that the filesystem must be compiled into the kernel image not as a
module b/c in 2.4.xx filesystem compiled as module also work ........
And another thing is that I never succedded in booting the 2.6.xx
kernel __successfully__ compiled from 2.4.xx series (distribution with
default 2.4.xx series kernel like Fedora Core 1 or Redhat Linux 9) and
found that my mouse won't work on 2.6.xx series kernel, but the
distribution with 2.6.xx kernel series by default works fine .....
