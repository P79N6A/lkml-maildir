I was told, that the only thing that was needed was an ADD card. ( Analog to
Digital?)
If you are interested, I can call you and then conference Analog Devices,
and they will tell you what is needed, I bet IBM did whatever Analog Devices
told them to do. And they might even tell us what to do if they talk with
someone that knows (I was bumbling, while he was talking about all the IO
and G rates)
I don't think they have anything in the BIOS related to the HDAPS, else they
would have put something in it. (You can't even disable the chip in the
BIOS) I just think is the accelerometer, there, by itself with an extra card
they added.
