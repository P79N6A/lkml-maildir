Great. There's a better way, but it is not necessary. Let Linux-specific
applications use it for their benefit, but a portable application isn't
going that way because it's too much effort. If a simpler interface that
can be shared with half a dozen other system exists, the portable
application will use that and ignore better interfaces.
