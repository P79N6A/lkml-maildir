I would agree that it seems to be unrelated to the hardware.  It's happening on
too many different systems for me as well.  However, it seems to happen with
the worst of my CDs whether the system is heavily loaded or not.

I can't reproduce this.  Running
mount /mnt/cdrom ; ls -lR /mnt/cdrom | sum ; umount /mnt/cdrom ; isovfy
/dev/cdrom
consecutive times produces a different answer (size and checksum) from the sum
command virtually every time, but never once does isovfy give a filesystem error
for the CD.
