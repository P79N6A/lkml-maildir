Ok, maybe just because I've eaten too much candy tonight, but I do not
understand where you are trying to go with this odd pseudo code.
What's wrong with the _existing_ pci_config_read() and
pci_config_write() function pointers that ia64 and i386 have?  Can't you
just look into if the other archs can set them to the proper function in
their pci init functions too?
thanks,
