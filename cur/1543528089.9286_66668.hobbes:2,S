Now that we have kernel-based isapnp, how is it going to be used?
- Is it intended that isapnptools continue to work?  If so, will this be
incompatible with the kernel version (from the resource management POV)?
- Many drivers have their own private little isapnp vendor database
hardwired.  Is it appropriate to pull all this out and put it into a
user space config system?
Generally, what should driver maintainers be doing about this?
Thanks.
