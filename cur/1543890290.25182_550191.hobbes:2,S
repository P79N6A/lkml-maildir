I think Alan's per-arch patch was dependent upon an earlier patch.  He
fooled everyone by sending them out in random order, without sequence
nnumbers and without telling anyone the dependencies.  And the add-termios2
patch was a single megapatch whereas the enablement patches were a per-arch
sprinkle.
Here's tha arm bit of

Or you can just drop this patch and I'll resend it once
lots-of-architectures-enable-arbitary-speed-tty-support.patch is merged up.
