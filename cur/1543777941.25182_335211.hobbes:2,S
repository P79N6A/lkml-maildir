Hi,
[version 002]
'patchview' merges a patch file and a source tree to a set of
temporary modified files.  This enables better patch (re)viewing
and more viewable context.  (hopefully)
The patchview script is here:
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/scripts/patchview
usage: patchview [-f] patchfile srctree {ver. 002}
  -f : force tkdiff even if 'patch' has errors
  -s : single tkdiff even if patchfile contains multiple files
It uses (requires) lsdiff (from patchutils) and tkdiff.
patchutils:  
http://cyberelk.net/tim/patchutils/
tkdiff:      
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdiff/

Thanks for Nick Wilson and K.R. Foley for patches.
Changes for ver. 002:
- add -s (single) option for only one tkdiff at a time
- better option parsing
- fixed use of 'mktemp'
- exit if mktemp fails
-
