08:34:07 up 1 day, 21:25,  4 users,  load average: 1.10, 1.08, 1.03
I've also only done 3 seti units since yesterday morning, about 40% to 
50%  of my usual production even with the crashes.  In other words, 
system seems stable, but old dog slow too.  & thats with top showing 
seti getting 97-99% of the cpu.  Ouch!
