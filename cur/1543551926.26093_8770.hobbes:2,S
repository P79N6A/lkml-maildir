Intel marketing (c)(r)tm has said that its not Pentium IV but Pentium 4
(officially) ...
I bet one can find numeral puns everywhere ... (look at kernel ...)
My suspicion is that the Pentium 4 will be Intels latest IA32 Processor
familiy (or at least should be if there wasnt this AMD thing (<- note
humor, please)
And I think its not too bad. perhaps they put all their clever heads
into IA64 Processor department and IA32 only got beginners ... :-)
cheers Markus
