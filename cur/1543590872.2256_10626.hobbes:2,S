Yep, it's no big thing to make the change in the driver, the copy is not 
that expensive and compared to the speed of the physical layer its 
virtually a non-impact. The most I've ever got out of 16 mbps t/r is just 
over 2 mb/second and memory copies can easily keep up with that. (That's 
with 8192 byte mtu's and ftp transfers which wouldn't get copied anyway).
