Yea! 
Next we'll take care of those subversive linux bastards that clog up our big
pipes with their communist kernel downloads!
Unsolicited commercial email is a problem. However, many of the 'solutions'
are worse. Search for teergrube for a less subvertible aid. 
You can pile on technological 'fixes' as much as you want, but no
technological measure that does not totally oppress free use of the Internet
will be affective. Education is the only solution, spam will continue as
long as it is profitable.
