Oh, you know, I have customers who already moan about the too high rate of
updates in rhel3 because they can't keep all their machines to the same
version.

Well, I know we're often tempted to include our very last work with bugfixes
in an update, but I mean that if the work has already been done (internally),
I wonder why it cannot be done publicly. Except of course if the people
working on this are not really linked to mainline kernel development, which
I could understand.

That's not a problem, and it's even expected. In your kernel, you fix "easy"
things and you publicly state that USB or SCSI will not get fixed. Then you
provide people with a working 2.6 at a feature level equivalent to 2.6.9.
All those who are not hit with SCSI or USB are fairly happy. Others just have
to wait for the 2.6.10 updates which change SCSI and USB, and already expect
that it breaks a few things given the number of changes. Your kernels provide
the needed fourth digit numbering in some ways.
Cheers,
Willy
