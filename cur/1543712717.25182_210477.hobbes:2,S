Somehow I missed this discussion on the list, but I caught it on kerneltrap.
Anyhow, what I don't understand is why it would be so hard to have the 
block layer measure latency and dynamically adjust for each device. 
Start somewhat small, and when the block layer sees that a given device 
can handle larger requests without blowing latency requirements, 
increase the request size.  Keep a running average.
