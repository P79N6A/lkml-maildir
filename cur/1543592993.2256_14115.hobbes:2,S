current, as in MPS 1.1:
00:07.0 ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super South] (rev 40)
	Subsystem: ABIT Computer Corp.: Unknown device 0000
	Flags: bus master, stepping, medium devsel, latency 0
	Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2
50: 02 76 04 00 00 f0 ab 50 1f 06 ff 08 00 00 00 00
I'd say the lower 2 bits at 0x58 are set.
00:07.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. UHCI USB (rev 16) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
	Subsystem: Unknown device 0925:1234
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 5
	I/O ports at a000 [size=32]
	Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 2
30: 00 00 00 00 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 04 00 00
0x3X is at 5, not at 3.
