The following three patches are from me:
fix-for-cx88-cardsc-for-dvico-fusionhdtv-3-gold-q.patch
dvico-fusionhdtv3-gold-t-documentation-fix.patch
v4l-support-tuner-thomson-ddt-7611-atsc-ntsc.patch
...and they depend on the following two patches submitted by Mauro:
video-for-linux-docummentation.patch
v4l-add-support-for-pixelview-ultra-pro.patch
...When these patches are applied in the order listed in Andrew's email, the result is the same as what I currently have in v4l cvs.
