Can it be explained, why boot protocol and boot line must be expanded?
This amount of code for what?

If it is proposed for passing ACPI makeup language bugfixes by boot
line for ACPI parser in the kernel, or "telling to kernel what to do
via EFI" then it's kind of very nasty red flag.
I'd suggest to have initramfs image ready with all possible
data/options/actions based on very small amount of possible boot line
information.
Any _right_ use-cases explained for dummies are appreciated.
Thanks.
