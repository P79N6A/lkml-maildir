it will all conflict with pending bits in the x86 tree, so i'd prefer if 
Len did this atomically after 2.6.29-rc1, without it having this 
long-term breakage effect.
Historically drivers/misc/ has been more active via the ACPI tree. (Len 
being the (in-)voluntary maintainer for those platform details)
So drivers/x86/ makes sense i guess. Eventually the really lowlevel bits 
might move to arch/x86/drivers/ or so - but i've got no strong opinion on 
it. There seems to be enough precedent of existing drivers/$ARCH 
hierarchies.
