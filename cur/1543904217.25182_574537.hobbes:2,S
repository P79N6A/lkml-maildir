I'm not saying that we can't try to tackle that problem, but first of
all you have a really nice narrow problem where updatedb seems to be
causing the kernel to completely do the wrong thing. So we start on
that.

OK, I'm not sure what the point is though. Under heavy memory load,
things are going to get swapped out... and swap prefetch isn't going
to help there (at least, not during the memory load).
There are also other issues like whether the CPU scheduler is at fault,
etc. Interactive workloads are always the hardest to work out. updatedb
is a walk in the park by comparison.

Yeah, and I suspect we might be able to do better use-once of
inode and dentry caches. It isn't really highly specific: lots
of things tend to just scan over a few files once -- updatedb
just scans a lot so the problem becomes more noticable.

Well it runs every day or so for every desktop Linux user, and
it has similarities with other workloads. We don't want to optimise
it at the expense of other things, but it _really_ should not be
pushing a 1-2GB desktop into swap, I don't think.

I guess /proc/meminfo, /proc/zoneinfo, /proc/vmstat, /proc/slabinfo
before and after the updatedb run with the latest kernel would be a
first step. top and vmstat output during the run wouldn't hurt either.
Thanks,
