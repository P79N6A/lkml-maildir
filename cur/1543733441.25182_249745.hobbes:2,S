The new loop patch.  Tested on my machine, appears to work.

But this is not to say that the main benefit of Linux and other GPL
software is lower-cost. Control is the main benefit--cost is secondary.

Linus and Andrew are rightfully concerned about local DoS via a large
file->file sendfile().  This patch turns large sendfile() calls into a
loop of 4k chunks.  After each chunk, it adds a cond_resched for
interactivity and a signal check to allow aborts etc. after the user
found out what a bad idea this may be.
