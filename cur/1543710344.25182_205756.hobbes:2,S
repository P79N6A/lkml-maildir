Not quite there yet.
I have added a sleep(10); in send_fs_socket (smbmount) to give me time to 
send other requests to the fs. Here is what I get when I run the mount and 
two 'ls' in parallel:
1. smbmount mounts and goes to sleep
2. ls 1 ends up in smb_proc_ops_wait
3. ls 2 ends up in smb_proc_ops_wait
4. smbmount wakes up and passes the socket to smbfs
5a. ls 1 & 2 are woken and lists files
5b. Everyone is waiting for ls 1 (or 2 I don't know) to timeout.
6b. ls 1 lists nothing because of the timeout
7b. ls 2 lists normally
The difference between a and b is that in the first case I wait a few 
seconds between the two ls' but in the second I run the within one second 
of each other.
Some debug printks give:
a:
smb_proc_getattr_null: 
smb_proc_ops_wait: state: 1
smb_proc_getattr_null: 
smb_proc_ops_wait: state: 1
(here it waits for smbmount to do the ioctl)
smb_proc_ops_wait: result: 26192
smb_proc_ops_wait: result: 23014
b:
smb_proc_readdir_null: 
smb_proc_ops_wait: state: 1
smb_proc_getattr_null: 
smb_proc_ops_wait: state: 1
(here it waits for smbmount to do the ioctl)
smb_proc_ops_wait: result: 0
smb_proc_ops_wait: result: 682
The difference must be that in a the inode data for the root inode is not 
considered current when the second ls runs, but I don't understand why the 
readdir is printed before the getattr.
