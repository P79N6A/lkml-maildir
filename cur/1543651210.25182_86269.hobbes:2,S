Oh, Oh,
I meant the above that I *do* agree you. I just wanted to say,
two function was kept inline because from before 2.4 until though 2.5.44,
it was inlined, and when I received the faster-intel-copy from
Takahashi, I was working my patch against 2.5.44.
Just move __copy_to/from_user to usercopy.c will decrease the 
kernel size and should be almost the same as before. 
Am I missing something?

Is this relevant to this patch?
I did not change any in my patch about it.

You mean almost no overhead.

It could be said more efficient but faster?
The code or binary size directly connected to this issue?

I agree, as my first comment.
