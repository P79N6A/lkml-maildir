There is code in pci_read_bridge_bases which will decide under some
circumstances that a PCI-PCI bridge is transparent and set
	child->resource[i] = child->parent->resource[i];
for i = 0, 1 or 2.  What will happen with your request_resource in
this case is that the resource will end up being its own parent and
its own child and all allocations against it will fail. :)
I hit this just yesterday on PPC.  On our RS/6000 boxes, if you have a
PCI-PCI bridge with nothing behind it, the firmware will configure it
with all the apertures closed, i.e. with base set larger than limit.
Then pci_read_bridge_bases goes and decides that the bridge is
transparent and consequently everything stops working. :(
Does anyone really need that "assuming transparent" stuff in
pci_read_bridge_bases?  If so we need to add a check for the case
where base == limit + 0x1000 (for I/O) or base == limit + 0x100000
(for memory) and conclude that the aperture is closed in that case.
Paul.
