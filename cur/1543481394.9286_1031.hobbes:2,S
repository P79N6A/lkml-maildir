  POSIX way would be to have  sysconf()  call to extract this information.
Linus' earlier comments (mid December?) ignoring, I do think Linux would
benefit from the   sysconf() / pathconf() / fpathconf()  trio.
Apparently *only* SPARC systems have it. (For SunOS compability.)
It is somewhat difficult to modifying presentation machinery of some
values in e.g. /proc/123/stat "file" to scale them so that they always
present their value as if the HZ would be the ``classical constant''
for given platform.  For example, where would the ``classical constant''
be taken from, if the only instance of ``HZ'' is modified ?
In this case the deprecated  sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)  would be THE answer
to solve the problems that  ps/top/et.al. have.
