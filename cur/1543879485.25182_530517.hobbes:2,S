most dvb usb drivers call the device node unregistration when a device 
gets unplugged (when
At this time the filehandle can still be open, the patch on that site 
sets a flag that disallows
any further access to the device node (in the DVB framework there are 4 
of such nodes)
This can happen any time, so while someone is reading or accessing the 
device some structures
might have gone away already and this could cause an oops.
The problem of the DVB framework is file operation related, the last 
user calls fops_put on the existing
structure and sets the pointer to NULL before it wakes up the other 
function which frees the file operation
structure.
In Alan's case isn't there any users flag available that shows that the 
structure is still beeing accessed?
If that would be the case he could set a flag when he enters my_exit 
which would disable access to all other
functions by returning an error value at the beginning of the other 
functions, the only way out would be
to call my_release for existing users and wake up my_exit when the last 
reference to that structure is gone.
Some more information about the whole driver/scenario would be helpful.
