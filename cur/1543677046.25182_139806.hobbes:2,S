If you change the behaviour with queued_task_nr > batch_requests it is
less fair period. Whatever else thing I don't care about right now
because it is a minor cpu improvement anyways.
I'm not talking about performance, I'm talking about latency and
fariness only. This is the whole point of the ->full logic.

I'm claiming that with queued_task_nr > batch_requests the
batch_requests logic still has a chance to save some cpu, this is the
only reason I didn't nuke it completely as you suggested some email ago.

I definitely want 1 request in the elevator at once or we can as well
drop your ->full and return to be unfair. The whole point of ->full is
to get the total fariness, across the tasks in the queue queue, and for
tasks outside the queue calling get_request too. Since not all tasks
will fit in the I/O queue, providing a very fair FIFO in the
wait_for_request is fundamental to provide any sort of latency
guarantee IMHO (the fact an _exclusive wakeup removal that mixes stuff
and probably has the side effect of being more fair, made that much
difference to mainline users kind of confirms that).
