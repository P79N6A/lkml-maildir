Subject: Support for applications which need NFS or CIFS "share_deny" flags on open

Some of the Wine community posted last month to the cifs mailing list
asking about a change needed for Wine for working properly over
network mounts, but the change is not really cifs specific and would
help other file systems as well so I wanted to mention it here.   The
original post was:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-cifs-client&m=122505569315992&w=2
Support for the flags they suggest would be easy for cifs (the
protocol has a field for this, and cifs clients on various other OS
set it), and should be fairly easy for NFSv4 (the RFC for NFSv4
specifies the "share_deny" field within the NFS open request, and
various clients, but not Linux, set it), and would allow WINE to
function properly over a network mount.

Presumably for applications on local mounts, wine mediates their own
mandatory locks, but this is impossible on network mounts without this
change (and can lead to data corruption).
