IP connections are quads (four-tuples), machine A and B IP addresses,
plus 16 bit port numbers at both ends.
You can have about  64 k * 3 G = 192 T  connections out from a machine
to any single port number out there to all existing IP addresses.
If  A.ip, B.ip, and B.port  stay the same, A can setup up to some
10 - 50 thousand parallel connections.  (Depending on allowed dynamic
source IP port number space at machine A.)
If either B.ip or B.port changes, A can reuse a port that is actively
connected to something. Resulting four-tuple is different -> connection
is different.
Does Linux reuse port numbers in this way ?
It most likely does, but I didn't verify.

You want to make a "L4 switch" -- a "load balancer" ?
That thing is a NAT-box, and is really not making buffered TCP flows,
but rather mapping IP/TCP header rewriters to divert the flows to new
destinations.

With 50 thousand connections per single ( A.ip / B.ip / B.port ) set,
one needs only 32  B.ports or A.ip:s or B.ip:s to do that 1.6 million
parallel TCP streams.
Such does eat up lots and lots system kernel memory...
