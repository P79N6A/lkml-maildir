Ok i had another look and i can see why you need a seperate release 
function, as we don't always do the kobject_cleanup immediately.
John and myself had a look and now we have the following race on 
->release() function exit.
my_release_fn()
{
	complete(&my_completion);
	<== [1] stall anywhere here, e.g. preempt/schedule
}
cleanup_module()
{
	wait_for_completion(&my_completion);
	<== [1] this task gets scheduled, free()s module text
}
