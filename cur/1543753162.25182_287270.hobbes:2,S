We are talking about two different things here. POSIX is just about API and
has, correct me if I'm wrong, nothing to do with system calls whatsoever. The
manpage nice(2) is about the libc library call nice(), which is per-process,
which it should be according to POSIX. The system call, called sys_nice() in C,
is per-thread. Apparently glibc or some thread library contains some magic to
make the translation.
