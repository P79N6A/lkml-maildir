We should have added the sysctl numbers to that warning.
Lots of things do sysctl(KERN_VERSION), including FC5's date(1).  Andi's
proposal to put some hard-wired KERN_VERSION emulator in there sounds
reasonable to me, depending upon how many other things we'll need to
emulate (which we don't know yet).

It should always be an objective to remove code if we can feasibly find a
way to do so.  For us to give up now and to leave all that goop in there
forever would be sad.
A patch which enhances that printk would be appreciated...
