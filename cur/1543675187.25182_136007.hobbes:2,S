01-av7110-firware.diff
 - looks fine (obsiously :)).  If the old driver works with the
   new firware I'd suggets sending it to Linux now
02-saa7146-core.diff
 - the WRITE_RPS0 macro is ugly as hell, you probably want to
    replace it with a proper inline.  But you can leave this to
    a later patch.  If it doesn't need the other updates I'd
    suggest submitting it now.
03-dvb-core.diff
 - okay, this is a big one..  Could you submit the typedef removal
   as a first separate patch so the actual changes are reviewable
   more easily?
 - please use <linux/types.h> not <asm/types.h> everywhere
 - please include <asm/*.h> headers after <linux/*.h> ones
 - This is wrong:
-static struct dvb_device dvbdev_dvr = {
+static
+struct dvb_device dvbdev_dvr = {
   instead of breaking the indention rather fix the reamining parts
   of the driver
 - dvb_kernel_thread_setup doesn't need the BKL
04-dvb-drivers.diff
 - looks ok
05-update-frontends.diff
 - looks ok
06-new-frontend.diff
 - looks ok (except for the above mentioned indentation issues)
07-dvb-core-lib-user.diff

08-analog-saa7146-update.diff
 - looks ok (obviously)
09-saa7111-i2c-fix.diff
