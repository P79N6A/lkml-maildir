meaning you're subscribed to linux-kernel-digest or
linux-kernel-daily-digest at lists.us.dell.com, so this clearly isn't
an issue with vger.kernel.org, right?

Hmmm.  Nothing has changed on lists.us.dell.com regarding these lists in
quite a while.  Can you provide an example message that you believe is
incorrect?
The linux-kernel-digest list sends one digest every 100KB, which I
think is also near the vger single message size limit.  Any chance
what came through was a single message, yet still wrapped in a digest?

They'll have the normal mailman list headers on every message, can't
you use those?

This is the first I've heard of any problems with the digester in a
long time.  Please provide an example message as requested above, and
I'll look into it.
Thanks,
