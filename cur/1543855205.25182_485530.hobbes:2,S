What do you mean by post-2.6.19?  Things go into 2.6.19.x via
stable@kernel.org, if that's what you're asking.
Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt describes what patches are
appropriate for 2.6.19.x, and given that we're so close to the 2.6.19
final release, I'm working under similar rules for what I'm going to
merge into 2.6.19.
