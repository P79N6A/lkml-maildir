I looked around a bit by using some command lines and ended up wondering 
if these are equal to busy-wait case (and should be fixed) or not:
./drivers/telephony/ixj.c
6674:   while (atomic_read(&j->DSPWrite) > 0)
6675-           atomic_dec(&j->DSPWrite);
...besides that, there are couple of more similar cases in the same file 
(with braces)...
