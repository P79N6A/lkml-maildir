	You see, I try to be a good citizen (even if sometime I feel
very "emotional" about dropped patches). There is already a good chunk
of IrDA patches in 2.4.17, so this will wait 2.4.18. Moreover, this is
"rc1", and I make a point of always sending my patches at the
beggining of the "pre" series and batched.
	I have already another IrDA minor cleanup sent to me by Kai
Germaschewski. I'll batch that together. It's not like it's urgent...
	Regards,
	Jean
