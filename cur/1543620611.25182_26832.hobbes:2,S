Promise driver + 2.4.17, see:

raid1 creation   |  fast |  fast

mkfs doesn't behaves too badly but it did when I first tried to raid1 the 
whole disks.
Raid1 is software only.
As soon as a filesystem on the promise adapter comes into play, writes maxes 
out at 2,5Mo/s. The previous machine (old PA2012 motherboard) with 8 times 
less memory was able to stand 4~5Mo/s with vanilla broken kernel.
Now it's running 2.4.18-pre3-ac2 but the behavior is the same with vanilla
pre, vanilla + akpm ll, +ide patches. Feel free to ask if you want a test on a
specific version. I have dedicated a partition on each disk for testing.
