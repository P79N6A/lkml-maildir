It's been told and widly known that it was going to be removed last
July.  In July 2004 this happened, so people have known for over a year.
How much longer do you expect me to give people?

I never said that ndevfs was to be a solution for anyone, just for

devfs-like solution.  And if they worry about this, then they can keep
that patch outside of the main kernel tree for their distros quite
easily.
