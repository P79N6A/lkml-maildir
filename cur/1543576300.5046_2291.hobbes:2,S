Yes; it looks nicer not to grow the number of ioctls more and more,
but to make things more visible in /proc.
On the other hand, there are some advantages of the ioctl:
It's fast, easy and does not need /proc. That cab be of relevance
for embedded devices, e.g., where ram is short.

Yes, looks like a good solution to me.
But that's far more complicated than the ioctl.
Looking at the sources and starting to write some code, it's not so obvious
to me how to get the right device no all the time and how to create the
correct symlink also in 2.2. Yes, it needs to work on both 2.2 and 2.4 
kernels.
So, I'd like to ask for inclusion of the original patch.
Or can we come up with the /proc/tty solution without adding too much code?
