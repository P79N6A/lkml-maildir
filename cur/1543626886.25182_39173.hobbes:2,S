What you just described is the way Mission Critical's 
crash dump facility implements this. It makes use of bootimg
Werner Almesberger's implementation of linux-boots-linux, to
soft reboot a new kernel without going through the bios on x86 
machines.
SGI lkcd doesn't do it that way today (btw, the lkcd project 
has now shifted to sourceforge, so the right place to look at 
is lkcd.sourceforge.net), but we are actually working on integrating
this mechanism from Mission Critical's mcore into lkcd, with
some enhancements/improvements. 
I'm cc'ing the lkcd-devel mailing list which is where we discuss
such stuff.

So how is the actual writeout accomplished ?(via LinuxBIOS ?)
