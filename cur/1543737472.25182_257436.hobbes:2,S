Subject: [bug] 2.6.8: CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctls failing as non-root on ide scsi drives
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

kernel 2.6.8.  ioctl ("/dev/hdc", CDROM_SEND_PACKET, cmd)
commands that are failing as non-root, even when permission is granted
rwxrwxrwx to /dev/hdc, are, according to some debug info added to k3b:
	GET CONFIGURATION (46)
	error code: 0
	sense key: NO SENSE (2)
	asc: 0
	ascq: 0
and:
	MODE SELECT (55)
	error code: 0
	sense key: NO SENSE (2)
	asc: 0
	ascq: 0
the result is that k3b cannot determine that the drive exists, therefore
it cannot use it even though cdrecord might actually work.
as root, the following errors occur:
	MODE SELECT (46)
	errorcode: 70
	sense key: ILLEGAL REQUEST (5)
	asc: 26
	ascq: 0
	READ DVD STRUCTURE (ad)
	errorcode: 70
	sense key: NOT READY (2)
	asc: 3a
	ascq: 0
presumably it can be concluded that the GET CONFIGURATION ioctl command
is the one at fault.
... what gives?

Truth, honesty and respect are rare commodities that all spring from
the same well: Love.  If you love yourself and everyone and everything
around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
