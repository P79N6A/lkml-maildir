I couldn't. Problems getting devfsd patched in 2.2.19 :-( - and I'm
going on vacation in shortly...
Now after the last couple of "lost interrupts" I set a debian-stable
as my primary firewall/router box in front of my server - this way I
got rid of the second nic and freed both slot 4 and 5. Unfortunately,
after a couple hours running my box again lost irq :-(.
And there's no obvious huge transfer going on. The boxes were just
alone. Now I try again noapic (different setup). Hope that
works. Otherwise I'm kind of lost...
