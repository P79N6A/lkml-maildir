Unfortunately we don't know what type of inode we have when calling
alloc_inode.  We only know it after reading in the inode from disk,
aka in unlock_new_inode.  Then again there is no reason to use
i_mutex before unlock_new_inode returns, so maybe we could defer
initializing it until unlock_new_inode.  I'm pretty sure we'll have
to fix a few filesystems that take i_mutex before that despite not
needing it, e.g. through i_size_write, though.
