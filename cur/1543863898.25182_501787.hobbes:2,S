lsscsi is a utility that uses sysfs in linux 2.6 series kernels
to list information about SCSI devices and SCSI hosts. Both a
compact format (default) which is one line per device and a
"classic" format (like the output of 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi') are
supported.
Version 0.19 is available at
http://www.torque.net/scsi/lsscsi.html
More information can be found on that page including examples
and a Download section for tarballs, rpm and deb packages.
This version adds transport specific information.
