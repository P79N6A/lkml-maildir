I was hoping Intel might have rediscovered the IOMMU by then and be back
on feature parity with the VAX 11/750

This is true for some cases but not all for iotlb
CPU generated data going out that won't be rewritten immediately should
be a cheap path not needing the cache. Incoming data would invalidate
the cache anyway if it arrives by DMA so the ioat would move it
asynchronously of the CPU without cache harm
Might also be interesting to use one half of a hypedthread CPU as a
copier using the streaming instructions, might be better than turning it
off to improve performance ?
