Sorry, but you're wrong - in the context of time_t, every day is 86400
seconds long. man 2 time says so clearly in the notes:
NOTES
       POSIX.1 defines seconds since the Epoch as a value to be interpreted as the number of sec‐
       onds between a specified time and the Epoch, according to a formula  for  conversion  from
       UTC  equivalent  to  conversion  on  the naive basis that leap seconds are ignored and all
       years divisible by 4 are leap years.  This value is not the same as the actual  number  of
       seconds between the time and the Epoch, because of leap seconds and because clocks are not
       required to be synchronized to a standard reference.

I'm not fighting this - the real world has all these issues but the
world of time_t does not. You want to redefine time_t to include all
the leap seconds that were already added (34) or perhaps only the
future ones; either approach is a disaster. It's unreasonable to change
the semantics of something as fundamental as time_t when so much code
depends on those semantics.
Instead, define a new timebase which counts time predictably and
unambiguously then a set of mappings to derived time values like
time_t, UTC and local time.

Please read the NOTES section, which clarifies what "seconds since
the Epoch" means.
Nick.
