And should speakup be a kernel module? Why?
It looks doable from userland:
/dev/vcsa tells you what is on screen. Maybe you need to add poll()
support?
/dev/input allows you to get keys pressed.
What is missing? Yes, you may want to do a small kernel module to read
kernel bootup messages. Anything more?
