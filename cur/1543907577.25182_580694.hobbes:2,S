I don't think it's a problem for high priority (RT) tasks - it's well
known in the real time Linux community that you never, ever do IO from
a thread that has to satisfy RT constraints.  A correct RT linux app
does its IO from a SCHED_NORMAL thread, with *plenty* of buffering,
and feeds the RT constrained SCHED_FIFO threads using a lock free
ringbuffer.
SCHED_IDLE starving SCHED_NORMAL is an issue of course.  But
SCHED_IDLE seems a lot more useful for read than write which I would
expect to take fewer locks.  For example I'd expect Beagle to want to
read at SCHED_IDLE but write out its indices at SCHED_NORMAL.
Would it make any sense to allow anyone to set SCHED_IDLE for reads
but require root to change IO priority for writes?
