Thanks, and I forget to cc every one :-P
I just come up from the lower layer, I suspected that it's the ide/ide-cd's
flaw.
If the upper layer is fine, there should be some thing due to interface. 
To me, ide just seems fine, ide-cd have some trival issue on error handling,
I don't think they are so bad that can be called flaw. While do abort on
this or that error case is just all I can do in ide-cd.
Now I do not have any more point - I will try what I said, just wait for my
result, hehe.

I dunno, I really don't know enough about the IDE driver and the block
layer to help much here.  :-(
I tried to read the IDE/Block/ISO9660 layers once to figure out why it
sometimes crashes and puts processes into permanent D state, and the
block and fs layers were nice and sensible, but as soon as I hit the IDE
driver I just gave up.  Ugh.  More special cases than code.
People in the mailist list don't seem all that interested, though, but
they're the one with a clue...
