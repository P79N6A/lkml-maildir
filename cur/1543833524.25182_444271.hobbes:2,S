Yes that solves the problem of the first seccomp task propagating it
to the other seccomp tasks.

Even the original patch of yours was perfectly fine in
practice. Eventually one of the per-cpu daemons would also be
scheduled even if there are more seccomp tasks per cpu.
But in my opinion if we care about this window and we change
something, it worth to close it completely, mostly for code-style
reasons (i.e. strict code). Note that the NOTSC will never be checked
unless there's a second task, so it's not a single timeslice.
As far as I can tell, the only way to close it completely, is to
require that the task that fires up seccomp is the current task. That
is a very fine requirement. That guarantees that no other cpu could
require any update in-core. So it's enough to always flip the NOTSC
bit in the current cpu with test_and_set_bit and to synchronously
update the cr4 accordingly to the result of test_and_set_bit, then we
can go back to the nicer (and faster) xor way in the scheduler slow
path ;).
This is incidentally exactly what I implemented and tested with my
last patch ;) (which is of course a modification and extension of
yours)
Thanks.
