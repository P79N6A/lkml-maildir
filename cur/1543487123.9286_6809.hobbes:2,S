I had anounced that I was working on some patch that fixes this problem
and after that, I heared of this problem being currently worked on by
several people. Douglas Gilbert mailed be about his current work on the
problem. I have immediately frozen my work and said him that I left him
complete his work. 
People that work on this problem must be aware that linux-2.2 need this
problem to be fixed and that only a clear, short and understandable patch
has chance to be accepted by Linus. So, it is advisable to provide fixes
as needed but not more, in my opinion.
Gérard.
