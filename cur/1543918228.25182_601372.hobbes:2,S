+
+Amend dir with a platform-specific "dma attribute".
+
+The only attribute currently defined is DMA_BARRIER_ATTR, which causes 
+in-flight DMA to be flushed when the associated memory region is written 
+to (see example below).  Setting DMA_BARRIER_ATTR provides a mechanism 
+to enforce ordering of DMA on platforms that permit DMA to be reordered 
+between device and host memory (within a NUMA interconnect).  On other 
+platforms this is a nop.
+
+DMA_BARRIER_ATTR would be set when the memory region is mapped for DMA, 
+e.g.:
+
+	int count;
+	int flags = dma_flags_set_attr(DMA_BARRIER_ATTR, DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
+	....
+	count = dma_map_sg(dev, sglist, nents, flags);
+
+As an example of a situation where this would be useful, suppose that 
+the device does a DMA write to indicate that data is ready and 
+available in memory.  The DMA of the "completion indication" could 
+race with data DMA.  Using DMA_BARRIER_ATTR on the memory used for 
+completion indications would prevent the race.
