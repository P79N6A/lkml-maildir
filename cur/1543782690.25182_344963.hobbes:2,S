In the old days notifier_call_chain used to be inline. Then someone looking
at code size out of lined it. Perhaps it should be inlined again or notifier.h
could supply a special faster inline version for time critical code.
Then it would be simple if (global_var != NULL) { ... } in the fast path.
In addition the call chain could be declared __read_mostly.
I suspect with these changes Christoph's concerns would go away, right?
