Hmmm, maybe it's just me, but I think of obsolete as meaning something
that's due to be removed whether it works or not, because it's
functionality is no longer required.  I thought we had
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL for not sufficiently tested code.
It always used to be that with no CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL tagged code
compiled in, it was very rare to get a compile failiure.  You could
rely on any kernel building, as long as you didn't touch
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.
Unfortunately, what seems to have happened is that things that really
should be tagged with CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, are so desired by a lot of
users that they are being moved out of the experimental phase too
soon.
John.
