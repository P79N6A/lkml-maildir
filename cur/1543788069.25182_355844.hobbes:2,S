4) If you insist on having /etc/mtab the same file in all namespaces,
you obviously will have its contents not matching at least some
of them.  Either have it separate in each namespace where you want
to see it, or simply use /proc/self/mounts instead.
BTW, "private" is an odd term - they are all on the same footing; "system"
one is just the namespace of init (and those of its descendents that share
the namespace with it).  Nothing special about it...
