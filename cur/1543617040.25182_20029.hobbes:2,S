Actually there is no yet 'autoconfigurator button'.
I recommend to run a std configuration tool and to check
the configuration before the kernel build phase.

We probe the hardware (but in a soft manner).
Better: we probe nothing, we ask kernel to give us the results
of already done kernel probes. Thus we never hang, we never crash
machine, no 10-15 reboots to install a new kernel.
The good news: this is nearly enought.
Linux is magic: it can do infinite loops in 5 sec, but also
it can configure automatically a new kernel without real hardware
probes!.
