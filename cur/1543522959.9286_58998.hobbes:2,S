Hundreds of CGIs running at the same time? Wow. But there I'd split load
among machines way before...

Higly stupid idea, typically.

I have such machines here (dozens of users, plus random services). Rarely
gets to 10.

Hundreds of people downloading at the same time is not the same as hundreds
of running tasks...

Yes. I expert load average to be in the ones soon, not 0.1s anymore.

Nobody is saying we shouldn't do it. But before screwing around, _measure_
where the real bottlenecks (for _real_ use, not benchmarks) are.
