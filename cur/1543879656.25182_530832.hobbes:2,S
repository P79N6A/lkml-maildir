Eric,
I can say that Linus, Ingo and you all got on the right track.
I could reproduce, I got a hung tty around 1400 running processes.
Fortunately, it was the one with the root shell which was reniced
to -19.
I could strace chvt 2 :
20:44:23.761117 open("/dev/tty", O_RDONLY) = 3 <0.004000>
20:44:23.765117 ioctl(3, KDGKBTYPE, 0xbfa305a3) = 0 <0.024002>
20:44:23.789119 ioctl(3, VIDIOC_G_COMP or VT_ACTIVATE, 0x3) = 0 <0.000000>
20:44:23.789119 ioctl(3, VIDIOC_S_COMP or VT_WAITACTIVE <unfinished ...>
Then I applied Ingo's suggestion about changing keventd prio :
root@pcw:~# ps auxw|grep event
root         8  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        SW<  20:31   0:00 [events/0]
root         9  0.0  0.0     0    0 ?        RW<  20:31   0:00 [events/1]
root@pcw:~# rtprio -s 1 -p 50 8 9     (I don't have chrt but it does the same)
My VT immediately switched as soon as I hit Enter. Everything's
working fine again now. So the good news is that it's not a bug
in the tty code, nor a deadlock.
Now, maybe keventd should get a higher prio ? It seems worrying to
me that it may starve when it seems so much sensible.
Also, that may explain why I couldn't reproduce with the fork patch.
Since all new processes got no runtime at first, their impact on
existing ones must have been lower. But I think that if I had waited
longer, I would have had the problem again (though I did not see it
even under a load of 7800).
Regards,
Willy
