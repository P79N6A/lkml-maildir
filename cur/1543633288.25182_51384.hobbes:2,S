If the application only had 10 or fewer, non-critical UDP ports
sending data, this conclusion might apply. However, even then, this
suggestions seems a little silly. "Why don't you call for a full stop
and then try them one by one?" is what I read this suggestion as
being.

Is it 'laziness' that the application needs to be able to minimize every
last CPU cycle, or is it 'optimization'?
To many designers, the determination that one should *be* lazy is
considered a virtue. The opposite extreme would suggest that "well
TCP/IP shouldn't be built into the kernel anyways... application
writers are just too lazy to implement the TCP/IP stack in user
space... it doesn't belong in the kernel..."
As for the "rest of the world eats the overhead just for this small group
that actually uses it"... this would be true... if every single Linux
kernel was built with the exact same configuration.
What am I saying? I haven't seen an effective argument against the
requirement, and I can see potential uses *for* the requirement.
Feel free to provide an effective argument against. :-)
Until then...
