i will try anyways since i don't use neither USB nor my parallel port :)
also, i have uploaded an overhauled version of the wakeup timer program. It
now deferres all output to another SCHED_FIFO thread [with prio 1 lower than
the main process]. The data is passed via a lockless fifo [ripped from jack
sourcecode]. Also it handles commandline options better and has sensible [?]
defaults:
~/source/my_projects/wakeup$ ./rtc_wakeup -h
usage: wakeup [options]
options:
-f freqency(hz) (default 1024) 
-p realtime prio (default 90(91))
-n max number of interrupts (default 0: run until stopped)
-t jitter threshold (%) (default 5) 
-o history_file (default /dev/null)
-h show help
The "history" file contains three rows: irq #, cycle count at wakeup,
jitter(%). The first few entries are probably off [due to startup stuff, all
reporting during runtime takes only irq's after the third into account, to
avoid the startup mess]..
grab it at

Here's a typical run (still on V0.5.16, will try V0.6 now):
~/source/my_projects/rtc_wakeup$ ./rtc_wakeup 
rtc_wakeup - press ctrl-c to stop
freq:             1024
max # of irqs:    0 (run until stopped)
jitter threshold: 5%
output filename:  /dev/null
rt priority:      90(91)
