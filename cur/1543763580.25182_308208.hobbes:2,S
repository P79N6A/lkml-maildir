That one's even more stupid:

This pointer is a local variable!  Setting it to null right before return
cannot possibly affect anything.

I think the problem is that they have a majorly hacked tree they're
working from as well as some quite inexperienced people working on it.
They need to do more internal peer review ... and clearly I need to
start reviewing their patches more carefully.
So yes, please revert this patch.  There is no way it can possibly
affect anything.
