I was using lirc 0.7.0 with Linux 2.6.8.1. Upon upgrading to Linux
2.6.11, I recompiled the lirc 0.7.0 hauppauge (lirc_i2c) modules for
the new kernel. This did not work. I then tried compiling the lirc
0.7.1 modules for the new kernel. This didn't work either. The error
message lircd gives is...
Apr 21 14:57:29 quince lircd 0.7.1: lircd(hauppauge) ready
Apr 21 14:57:52 quince lircd 0.7.1: accepted new client on /dev/lircd
Apr 21 14:57:52 quince lircd 0.7.1: could not open /dev/lirc0
Apr 21 14:57:52 quince lircd 0.7.1: default_init(): No such device
Apr 21 14:57:52 quince lircd 0.7.1: caught signal
I've also asked the lirc mailing list this question, but has anyone
else run into this trouble with lirc and Linux 2.6.11?
Please cc me in your reply. Thanks,
Shaun
