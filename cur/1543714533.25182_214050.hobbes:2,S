Hi, 
This is the v2.4.26 release candidate.
It contains a few important fixes, one fixing a memory leak in the fork() 
path and another fixing a exploitable ISO9660 symlink buffer overflow.
For those who use mainline kernels, upgrade is recommended.
v2.4.26 will be released shortly as -rc4.
Summary of changes from v2.4.26-rc3 to v2.4.26-rc4
