#DEFINE RANT 1
Ok, I may not know what I'm talking about, or it may not actually be a good 
idea, but I had an ipifany about the configure scripts.
	 I spend most of my time in the configure script turning everything into a 
module. (I play alot, and I like to have modules available to explore). There 
should a button or something where it will turn everything that CAN be 
compiled as a module, into  kernel modules. Then you can de-select a few 
things and compile the other few options that you need directly into the 
kernel. 
#IFDEF RANT
It would save me alot of time knowing that all those stupid NIC cards are 
being compiled as modules when i'm not sure which one I have. I would rather 
have all the modules available in case  NIC breaks anyways.  I change NICS 
and i'm never sure what kind it is until it doesn't work and I need to 
compile ANOTHER module. I know some of them are obscure cards, but with all 
the options I can't really be sure if it's a card I might come across or not. 
I'd rather be safe and have a meg or two of NIC modules around then have to 
rebuild or compile a new modules when I find an exotic card. 
#ENDIF
	Modules aren't used used until they're needed anyways so It wouldn't cause 
conflicts or a big size differnece in the kernel (in my understanding). For 
us with fast machines(AMD XP1800+) it would just be an extra 5-7 minutes for 
the other modules to compile.
Would anyone else be interested in this?
