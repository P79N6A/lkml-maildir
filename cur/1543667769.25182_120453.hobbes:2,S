Barf.  I haven't used a question mark operator in ten years, and this is a
fine demonstration of why ;)
I think a feasibly comprehensible transformation would be:
	/*
	 * A comment goes here
	 */
	if (bdi->memory_backed)
		may_enter_fs = gfp_mask & __GFP_IO;
	else
		may_enter_fs = gfp_mask & __GFP_FS;
That being said, this is a bit presumptuous.  PF_MEMALLOC will protect us
from infinite recursion but there are other reasons for GFP_NOFS.
For example, a memory-backed filesystem may be trying to allocate GFP_NOFS
memory while holding filesystem locks which are taken by its writepage.
How about adding a new field to backing_dev_info for this case?  Damned if I
can think of a name for it though.
