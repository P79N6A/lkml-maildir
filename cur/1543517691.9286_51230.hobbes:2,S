I like this table format better, with errors marked:
in Linux:  LINUP  linlow <98up> 98low <ntup> ntlow
in win98:  LINUP <LINLOW> 98UP  98low  NTUP <NTLOW>
in NT4:    LINUP  linlow  98UP  98low  NTUP  ntlow

Clearly NT displays everything right.
Lowercase must be written the Win98 way.
Uppercase must be written the Linux way.
