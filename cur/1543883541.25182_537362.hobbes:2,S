I doubt it.  Every time this comes up the problem of stacked I/O
configuration being able to reliably blow the 4k stack limit comes
up. Usually it's XFS that is blamed, but it seems ext3 and reiser
can both suffer from the same problem.  And now we can add things
like unionfs/ecryptfs into the stack as well....
Cheers,
Dave.
