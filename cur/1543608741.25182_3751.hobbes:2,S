Hi 
I am trying to write a device driver which calls
certain functions/variables from the kernel 
(e.g. ipv4_explicit_null from
/usr/src/linux/net/mpls/mpls_init.c )
But when I try to insert the module using insmod it
gives me an error saying unresolved symbol
ipv4_explicit_null
thinking the kernel did not export the said symbol  I
added EXPORT_SYMBOL(ipv4_explicit_null) in the file
mpls_init.c 
Now I can see the symbol in System.map
but my problem still persists. 
Am I exporting symbols properly or is there anything
else that needs to be done .
please advise 
thanks in anticipation,
amit
