They're not entirely obvious. The saved command line buffer size is
currently fixed so if we set a default that's larger, we'd like to
have a compile failure if it's too large.
Next step here is to make the buffer size configurable, which will
allow people to use command lines longer (or shorter!) than the boot
protocol allows (256 bytes on x86).
