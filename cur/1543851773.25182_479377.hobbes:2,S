Don't use a partition-table format that dates back to drives with  
actual reported physical geometry and which also maxed out at 2MB or  
so?  Even the mac-format partition tables (which aren't that much  
newer) don't care about physical drive geometry.
Besides, unless you're running DOS, Windows 95, or some random  
ancient firmware that looks at your partition tables or whatever you  
can just tell fdisk to ignore the 63-sector-alignment constraint and  
align your partitions more efficiently anyways.  But if you're  
dealing with hardware so new it supports 4k or 8k sectors, you really  
should be using EFI or something.
