- To know the current branch, "git branch" is enough (the one '*'-ed)
- rsync(1) a repository is dangerous, it might catch it in the middle of
  a update and give you an incomplete/messed up copy. Repeat rsync until no
  change, perhaps?
- I understand "git checkout -f" blows away any local changes, no questions
  asked. Not very nice to suggest that to a newbie...
Thanks for the docu!
