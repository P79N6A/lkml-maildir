Probably not: I don't know how about preemption model, but especially
some maybe unkilled timers/watchdogs or workqueues could be considered.
Of course this idea looks very unprobable (should happen with less
than 4GB too), but should be quite easy to verify by adding some
temporary spinlocks around these rx ring operations?
