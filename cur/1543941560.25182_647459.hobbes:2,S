I haven't got onto it, partly due to uncertainty about how bad 2.6.25 is
looking, partly because of how few 2.6.24-rcX-mmY releases there were,
partly because of how few people bothered testing those releases (case
study: did you?  If not why not?  Serious question.).
Sigh.  I'll take a look at doing it this afternoon.
