Hi
I have a Creative Ensoniq 1371 sound card. Kernel 2.2.x compiles ok with
it, but every attempt that i've made with the 2.3.x always end up like
this:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/kernel-source-2.3.15/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer  -pipe
-fno-strength-reduce  -DCPU=586    -c -o es1371.o es1371.c
es1371.c: In function `es1371_setup':
es1371.c:3109: section attribute cannot be specified for local variables
make[4]: *** [es1371.o] Error 1
make[4]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/kernel-source-2.3.15/drivers/sound'
make[3]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/kernel-source-2.3.15/drivers/sound'
