Of course it is. You find the module that isn't freeing it's
resources, fix it, and you don't get the panic when you access
/proc/ioports. It's really that simple.
Thinking that modules shouldn't be able to kill the kernel isn't
goint to help. Everything that runs inside the kernel has the
necessary priviliges to destroy anything in the kernel.
