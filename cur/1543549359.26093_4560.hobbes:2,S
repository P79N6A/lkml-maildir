Oh, I don't disagree at all.
I think we'll have the old order (Torben's patches seem to do that as far
as I can tell) for now, but I just wanted the long-range plan to be that
we shouldn't be as order-fragile as we are. 
No point in doing that now.

Yeah, I've considered it. For other reasons. We already have a few stages
of ordering, like having to initialize things like PCI etc before
initializing PCI devices, and right now those stages are all explicit (ie
pci_init() is _not_ an initcall).
Maybe.
