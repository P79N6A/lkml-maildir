Hi,
After upgrading to kernel 2.4.18pre7 (from 2.2.19), a recv() operation on
a UNIX socket returns 11 (EGAIN) even though the socket is blocking. My
code worked fine on 2.2.19.
I am doing some more debugging to see why this happens but I would like to
ask whether anyone else has had similar problems? Is this a known bug?
Thank you,
Matej
