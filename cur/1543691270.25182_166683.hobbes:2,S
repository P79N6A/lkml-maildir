When I pass audio_samplerate = 32000 to 
       ioctl(afd, SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED, &audio_samplerate)
it changes my audio_sample rate from 32000 to 31627.
Now, this is causing problems with my downstream apps so I did some
investigating. Looking into i810_set_adc_rate() in i810_audio.c, 
there is some wierd math going on..
1) first, the original rate (32000) is converted to a new rate ..
	rate = (rate * clocking)/48000
	where clocking, in my case, is 48566. 
2) this new value is fed into newrate=ac97_set_adc_rate() which returns 
   the orignal sampling rate value (32000).  This number is then modified
   by the ratio
	dmabuf->rate = newrate * 48000 / clocking.
3) This results in the value 31627 that I'm seeing.  Now, is this the
   actual sample rate, or some internal value used to generate a 32000kbps
   sample rate?  If so, is it perhaps a bug that dmabuf->rate is being
   returned rather than newrate?
Thanks,
