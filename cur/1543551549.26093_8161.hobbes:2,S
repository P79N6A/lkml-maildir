   Are there any reason why sym53c8xx and others initialize proc_name
   only if an adapter was actually found (or in the sym case, if a
   pcibus was found)?
I see no particular reason.  Why not code up the patch to fix all
these cases so we can find out? :-) I would recommend putting them all
into the host structure for that driver, unless there is some weird
reason the driver absolutely must generate the string at run time.
