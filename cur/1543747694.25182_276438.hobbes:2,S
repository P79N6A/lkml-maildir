Yes an extra function, or few lines in vfs_readdir().

I don't see how "worthless" is viewing certain files as directories.
It is worth to do 'vi /root/abc.tar.gz/README' to edit a file than to
inflate it yourself, make changes and deflate it again..deleting the
stuff inflated. And its on code's part to make it as reliable as
possible.

There lies a problem with tar formats. So the tar plugin writer should
take this into account. But I see no problem with, for example,
/etc/passwd as a directory. tar is just one possible (and probably
debatable) plugin that can be introduced with the help of this
framework.
