Heh. It would be very nice if we had the situation that you describe,
but that is actually not the case. TERM specifies the general
capabilities of the terminal. It does _not_ tell the application inside
which FONT encoding is used, nor whether it is compatible with multibyte
input.

Nonsense, sorry. How should your application know how to encode its
output? How should it know which font is used. I have heard about some
magic strings that application can send to the Xterm (when TERM=xterm)
to tell it to change the font encoding (similar to the string used to
set the window Title used by mc, for example). But this is an extension,
not mandatory for a general implentation of a "terminal".

And what controls the font setting? (see above)

See above. Especially since different chars are used to draw graphical
characters (lines, boxes, ...), they _must_ know which font encoding
they have to expect.
