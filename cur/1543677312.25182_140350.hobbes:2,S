Rob, Jonathan,
I am the webmaster for kclug.org, and can tar up the stuff I've created
if you like.  I grabbed the archives from other publicly available
locations several years ago.  I would assume you would rather have the
originals instead of my hackish processing of them.  I do still have
them as well if the sites I obtained them from aren't available anymore.
Here is one of my sources:
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/mail-archive/
Looks like my other source has been moved there as well.
Good luck!
