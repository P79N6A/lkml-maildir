Thanks for the reply,
Yes, PciRetry option is on in file XF86Config-4; and as I said in my 
previous mail, changing kernel-2.4.20 to 2.4.8 just solves the problem 
(ie I change nothing else).
I was thinking about a problem with my chipset (AMD760MPX, motherboard 
tyan tiger MPX); because I have done some tests on a PC with a matrox 
G200 PCI and a sound blaster live, with a chipset via KT333 and the 
problem doesn't seems to occur. Is it possible?
