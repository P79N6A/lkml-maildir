Hi.
POHMELFS is a very high-performance parallel network filesystem with
coherent local cache of data and metadata. It entered maintenance mode
and is being prepared for the next submission cycle.
I decided first to push it into the drivers/staging which was acked
by Greg for the wider testing and review and move into the vanilla tree
in the next merge window.
POHMELFS needs two exports from the core VFS: add_to_page_cache_lru and
__lock_page_killable.
Please apply given patch to the current tree.
