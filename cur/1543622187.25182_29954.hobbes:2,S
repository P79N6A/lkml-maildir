Following this logic, we should just fix the thing for
laptop users and ignore the few folks who run multiple
SCSI busses, right ?
Of course you'll shout bloody murder since you're part

I guess we want a solution which works for both situations,
instead of people discouraging each other from fixing the
kernel for situations they're not experiencing themselves.
