Neither am I, therefore I hope you get a reply from someone else
refuting or acknowledging my claims.
I looks to me that the code that does the actual registration of the
driver is in drivers/ide/ide-cd.c NOT cdrom.c.  Specifically
ide_cdrom_attach().  Said function eventually calls the register_cdrom()
you ask about.
For writing a cdrom emulator  You may want to look more closely at the
non-IDE/SCSI devices as they seem to register their driver data
themselves  I had a quick read of aztcd.c, I think between cdrom.c and
aztcd.c you should be able to piece together what you want.
