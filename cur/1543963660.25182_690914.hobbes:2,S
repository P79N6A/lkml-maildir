 Well, I take no habits that make no sense in the first place.  And I have
gone into great lengths to explain and justify what drives me in this case
-- I got it from the GNU standard and got convinced it is good, so I got
to using it.  I can write comments according to a different style, no
problem (as long as there is any defined style for a given case), but I
have to put some explicit effort into it.
 Similarly, habitually I write code in the Linux indentation style because
I like it, but I can use your hated GNU style (or any other that follows
any recognisable rules) as well, except I have to put some brainpower into
it.

 Well, sorry, but I could only sense the lack of style in this piece of
code, which is why I tried to apply some.  You are free to disagree and as
you have undertaken maintenance of this area I am going to respect it.

 The whole of SiByte support should eventually get converted to implement
platform initialisation.  I started some of this with changes to the
sb1250-mac.c Ethernet driver sometime in 2006, but no further progress has 
been made since.  I have other priorities higher on the list, but I have 
not forgotten about it and will come back at some point unless someone 
else does it first.

 I can see if I can find a couple of cycles to spare and give this piece
of code a shot with my SWARM.  There is a pair of 128kB EEPROM chips
onboard (one as a bootstrap option and one to store configuration) and I
have two SDRAM modules installed providing another pair of a smaller size.
