It's provided by Novell, with whom I have no direct contact and am not
presently authorized to speak on behalf of my organization. From what I
have read about the history of their support on this program and these
discs, I do not expect that they would be willing to support it except
in environments which they provide in monolithic form; it would be
possible for me to copy an updated version of the program out of such an
environment to use in my own customized one, but I am not certain that
they have even created such an updated version, and in any case
obtaining it would almost certainly require buying the latest version of
Novell ZENworks - which my organization is certainly not prepared to do
at the present time.
In other words: I don't think that's likely to be practical in the
present instance. If you have reason to believe otherwise (past positive
experience with Novell, for instance), I'd be glad to hear it.

Oh, well... thanks anyway.
Is there any place (aside from maybe the kernel changelog, which
contains a whole lot - if not several lots - of unrelated information)
where I could find a list of config-symbol name additions, changes,
deletions and meaning changes by version or by date? That would at least
let me build a mapping between the symbols in the older config and the
ones in the new one, which is about where I would have to start.
