Hi Andrew,
Take a look at the olympic driver (drivers/net/tokenring/olympic.c)
function olympic_proc_info. This is called from a read into the proc
filesystem. When we get the read we want to print out details on
all the olympic devices in the system so we have to scan the
pci tree and find a match based on base_addr. This works in both
2.2 and 2.4

pdev->driver_data = dev
Of course the driver has to implement this.
