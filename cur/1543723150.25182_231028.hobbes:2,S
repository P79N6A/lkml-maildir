But has a very distinct problem.  A segmentation fault is usually a
bug and deserves a core dump.  Sane default behaviour.  If the program
tells the kernel, it can handle segmentation faults on it's own, fine.
But if - while handling the fault - it creates a second one, the claim
was obviously false.  Coredump, done.
Now, how can the kernel tell, whether a second segmentation fault
happened inside the handler or after successfully handling the first
one?  Right, with longjmp it can't.  Coredump, done.
