I don't think there is current generation of Virtualization HW/SW that
can live with o-2% performance loss for all workloads (like the way
containers do).

I agree with most of it (except portability as using latest HW

I guess as far as memory is concerned, virtualized solutions can also
techniques like ballooning to oversubscribe memory.  But I agree that we
will almost always be able to pack things tighter in container
environment.

With hard guarantees, you will also end up making hooks in generic part
of kernel which could be considered invasive.  And yes, if you are
making a hard guarantee then you will some how make sure that amount of
resource is available all the time for that container.  As you mentioned
this is not the most optimal use of resources.  And that is why I don't
want to incorporate that in at least the first draft.  Please look at
the container kernel patches that I sent out yesterday.  They allow the
containers to go over board with memory as long as there is no pressure.
But the moment there is any pressure on memory, pages belonging to over
the limit containers get freed or swapped first.
