Applied to tip/core/header-fixes, thanks Sam for the quick patch!
Jaswinder, i think we now have a realistic chance to reach a zero baseline 
with these warnings, for v2.6.29. Here are the remaining warnings (summed 
up per file) on x86 (after Sam's patch):
     17 /dev/shm/tip/usr/include/linux/reiserfs_fs.h
     12 /dev/shm/tip/usr/include/linux/soundcard.h
      3 /dev/shm/tip/usr/include/linux/nubus.h
      2 /dev/shm/tip/usr/include/linux/in6.h
      1 /dev/shm/tip/usr/include/mtd/jffs2-user.h
      1 /dev/shm/tip/usr/include/linux/socket.h
      1 /dev/shm/tip/usr/include/linux/coda_psdev.h
      1 /dev/shm/tip/usr/include/linux/bsg.h
