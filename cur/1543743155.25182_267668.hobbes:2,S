Yeah, what Andi said. :)
I fully agree with Martin's statement "You WANT your data to be local."
However, it can become non-local in two different manners, each of
which wants tmpfs to behave differently.  (The next two paragraphs are
simply to summarize, no position is being taken.)
The manner I'm concerned about is when a long-lived file (long-lived
meaning at least for the duration of the run of a large multithreaded app)
is placed in memory as an accidental artifact of the CPU which happened
to create the file.  Imagine, for instance, an application startup
script copying a large file into a tmpfs filesystem before spawning
the actual computation application itself.  There is a large class of
HPC applications which are tightly synchronized, and which require nearly
all of the system memory (i.e. almost all the memory on each node).
In this case the "victim" node will be forced to go off-node for the
bulk of its memory accesses, destroying locality, and slowing down
the entire application.  This problem is alleviated if the tmpfs file
is fairly well distributed across the nodes.
But I do understand the opposite situation.  If a lightly-threaded
application wants to access the file data, or the application does
not require large amounts of additional memory (i.e. nearly all the
memory on each node) getting the file itself allocated close to the
processor is more beneficial.  In this case the distribution of tmpfs
pages is non-ideal (though I'm not sure it's worst-case).

It's a tough situation, as shown above.  The HPC workload I mentioned
would much prefer the tmpfs file to be distributed.  A non-HPC workload
would prefer the tmpfs files be local.  Short of a sysctl I'm not sure
how the system could make an intelligent decision about what to do under
memory pressure -- it simply isn't knowledge the kernel can have.
I've got a new patch including Andi's suggested sysctl ready to go.
But I've seen one vote for defaulting to on, and one for defaulting
to off.  I'd vote for on, but then again I'm biased. :)  Who arbitrates
this one, Hugh Dickins (it's a tmpfs change, after all)?  From SGI's
perspective we can live with it either way; we'll simply need to
document our recommendations for our customers.
As soon as I know whether this should default on or off, I'll post
the new patch, including the sysctl.
Thanks,
Brent
