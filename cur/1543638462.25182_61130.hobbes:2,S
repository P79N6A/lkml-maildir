Hmmh, note that checkconfig.pl is actually not necessary anymore, it could 
be replaced by just including config.h unconditionally, or even include 
the macros from the commandline (-imacro include/linux/autoconf.h, I think 
you yourself did suggest that ;). The old build system relied on
#include <linux/config.h> to get "make dep" right, but that's not 
necessary anymore.
So I'm not sure introducing such a kind-of-weird rule for "version.h" is
the right way to go. An alternative would be to follow kaos' suggestion
and split version.h into uts_release.h (for the UTS_RELEASE macro) and
version.h for the numeric version. Then just include version.h from
kernel.h and be done with it.
