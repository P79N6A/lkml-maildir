I think you should complete your emotional email with decription of how
atomic types are operated and how processors access data. Just to give a
lesson to those who never knew how SMP works, but create patches and
have the conscience to send them and even discuss.
Then, if of course you will want, which I doubt, you can reread previous 
mails and find that it was pointed to that race and possibilities to 
solve it way too long ago. 
Anyway, I prefer to look like I do not know how SMP and atomic operation
work and thus stay away from this discussion.

In case you have stacked device, this entry will be rewritten and you
will lost all your account data.
