Please note one sample from ext2 code:
	if (le32_to_cpu(es->s_rev_level) > EXT2_GOOD_OLD_REV)
And from partition handling code linux/fs/partitions/sun.c:
	/* All Sun disks have 8 partition entries */
	spc = be16_to_cpu(label->ntrks) * be16_to_cpu(label->nsect);
You see those many le32_to_cpu() and reverse commands?
If there is something that has to be fixed for linux/fs/partition/whatever.c -
please fix it there if you are actually *needing* it.
You also notice that the option was used only by the
taskfile_(in|out)put_bytes() function, which in turn was only used for
taks_in_intr, which in turn only matters for PIO mode but did NOTHING to DMA
transfers for example? DMA transfers are those days the >> 90% most common
on disks in PC systems. And you notice that the IDE driver sometimes starts in
DMA and falls backs to DMA if it has for example to fill in a not full memmory
page?
And you notice that the SCSI people are more likely to exchange disks
regularly between some RISC big endian host and linux on intel?
Please ask yourself why they don't have someting like the byteswap option.
Do you remember that byteswap was something introduced by the Atari people
a long long time ago even before the fs code started to understand
about native endianess issues and is today both: broken (it *may* work
for someone but it *is* broken) unneccessary and not the proper
way to deal with the problems in question?
You notice as well that the arch specific bytswapping for physically
cross wired ata host chips on some historical archs is still there
where it should be?
You don't? So please flame me now as much as you desire...
