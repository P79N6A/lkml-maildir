Since it affects a fragile area of e1000 for all [e1000] users, I much 
prefer to err on the side of caution.  I have a history of pulling 
wide-impact fixes like this, late in -rc cycle, and having yet more 
breakage appear.
But if Andrew or Linus disagree, feel free to override me.  This is just 
area where I am intentionally over-cautious.
