M.H.VanLeeuwen (sp?) has gotten more info (in another thread on l-k). One
processor goes el3_start_xmit() -> diasble_irq() -> synchronize_irq()
where it possibly stops in wait_on_irq(). That would make me think the
other processor is running eternally in interrupt context and the other
decides to wait for it. My head is aching of reading the 3c509.c (let
alone the interrupt code for x86), so I might be well wrong.
The details on eexpress lockup are still a bit hazy. It seems to fail in
different ways (if I have time I'll try to whip up a report).
Happy hacking,
