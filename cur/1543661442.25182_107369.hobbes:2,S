Yup, it's definitely the HP hardware, since we also only see this problem 
on the NetServers. I haven't worked with the LH series, though, just the 
LT series. We've brought up issues like this with their support 
organization, with the inevitable response "unable to reproduce problem" 
and a closed ticket. We've given up since they ditched the NetServer line 
in favor of the Proliants anyways.
Good Luck.
