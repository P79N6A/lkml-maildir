Hello list,
I recently re-tried 2.5.x kernels on my 'new' laptop. Works like a charm.
There's one very annoying problem tho: sometimes the system seems to think 
that one keypress is many, so you get like 5x the same letter when typing 
something.
This was already present in the older kernels I tried (2.5.4x).
Any fix on this issue? Rather annoying when you're trying to code something 
:-(
