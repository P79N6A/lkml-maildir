Subject: [PATCH] NetWare File System Submission 2.4.15-pre5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I posted a patch at ftp.timpanogas.org and ftp.utah-nac.org that
rolls the NetWare File System (NWFS) into the 2.4.15 kernel.  This 
patch is located at ftp.timpanogas.org:/nwfs/nwfs-2.4.15-pre5-3.bz2.
It has been submitted to Linus as well.  I have not seen the posting show
up yet on the list when I posted it, and I think it may have been 
too large a file.  It's available for download at the above address.
This patch integrates NWFS into the Linux kernel.
