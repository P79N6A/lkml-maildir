   The second point was that interrupt mitigation must remain enabled, even 
   with NAPI: the automatic mitigation doesn't work with process space 
   limited loads (e.g. TCP: backlog queue is drained quickly, but the 
   system is busy processing the prequeue or receive queue)
Not true.  NAPI is in fact a %100 replacement for hw interrupt
mitigation strategies.  The cpu usage elimination afforded by
hw interrupt mitigation is also afforded by NAPI and even more
so by NAPI.
See Jamal's paper.
Franks a lot,
