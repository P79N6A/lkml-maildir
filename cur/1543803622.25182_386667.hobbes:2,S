Indeed they are, at present and quite likely into posterity.  But
they're not a common case here, and migrate_page_add now handles them
silently, so why bother to complicate it with an unnecessary check?
You added the test because the WARN_ON fired, you're now doing the
right thing and removing the WARN_ON because it was inevitably racy,
so it would make sense to remove the PageReserved test too.
If you look through the rest of mm/, you'll find 2.6.15 removed all
the PageReserved tests, except at the low level in page_alloc.c:
so it's retrograde for you to be adding one back here.  Testing
PageLRU would be more relevant, if you insist on such a test.
Or have you found the zero page mapcount distorting get_stats stats?
If that's an issue, then better add a commented test for it there.
Hmm, that battery of unusual tests at the start of migrate_page_add
is odd: the tests don't quite match the comment, and it isn't clear
what reasoning lies behind the comment anyway.
