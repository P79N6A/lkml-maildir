It should probably noted that really hardcore timestamp users 
have their NICs do it for them, since interrupt coalescing 
makes timestamps done in the kernel too inaccurate for them even
if rdtsc is used (
http://www-didc.lbl.gov/papers/SCNM-PAM03.pdf
)
Not that it's anywhere near a univeral solution since more or less only 
one brand of NICs supports them.
It would probably be a useful experiment to see whether the performance is
improved in a noticeable way if say jiffies were used. If so, it might be a
reasonable choice for a configurable option, if not then not. 
Isn't stuff like this the reason why the experimental network patches tree
that was announced a while back is out there? ;-)
