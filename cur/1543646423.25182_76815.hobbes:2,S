You probably can see it also with driverfs :-(

The device registration was moved outside the st_dev_arr_lock spinlock but
it seems that I was a bit careless, after all. The driverfs/devicefs
registration loop contains the following lines:
            tpnt->driverfs_dev_r[mode].driver_data =
                        (void *)(long)__mkdev(MAJOR_NR, i + (mode << 5));
            tpnt->de_r[mode] =
                devfs_register (SDp->de, name, DEVFS_FL_DEFAULT,
                                MAJOR_NR, i + (mode << 5),
                                S_IFCHR | S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO,
(two of each type)
In the original location i did contain the device number but here it
contains 4 (from the latest loop). The fix seems to be to replace i by
dev_num but I have not yet tested it.
Thanks for reporting the bug.
