Something like "echo 1234 > /proc/root_uid" ?
And from that moment on, "uid 1234" has root-powers, but not uid 0?
Well, "init" will already be running, and have uid 0. It won't like
its powers taken away.

To set the uid? yes.

There is a macro "suser" in older kernels that did something like
	return (current ->uid == 0)
which is now replaced by capabilities stuff. That capabilities stuff
is much better.
Replacing that macro with 
	return (current->uid == root_uid) 
and declaring the root_uid variable isn't more than 15 minutes
work. Getting the proc interface working might take the rest of the
day. I don't think that the "level" of this assignment is valid for a
final project.
But what will all this gain you? A program classically requiring
"root" to run, will now run under "1234", and getting that program to
do "exec /bin/sh" will still give a root-power-shell.
And if you're afraid that current exploits are doing
	setreuid (0,0);
	exec ("/bin/sh");
or
	cp /bin/sh /tmp/.sh
	chown 0 /tmp/.sh
	chmod 4755 /tmp/.sh
then you should realize that the first needs to be rewritten to:
	t = geteuid ();
	setreuid (t,t);
	exec ("/bin/sh");
and that the second has an extra "chown" that serves no purpose except
to make it fail when your patch is installed. Without the chown, it will
work with and without the patch!.

Yes.
