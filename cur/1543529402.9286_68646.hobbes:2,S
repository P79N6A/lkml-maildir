Ok, I'll try, but I bet my system will be less usable (no mouse) than it was
before with modules.

I can tell, but the way I've always seen it, if you don't need it to boot,
you don't need it in the kernel.

So are you saying that my cardbus controller is hard wired to irq's 5 and
10 which the bios has no control over?

Well if I decide to insert a pcmcia card, does this mean it will use that
"yenta irq" or will it assign a new one?

Sony.  Never cared for them, and I've never had a sony product that didn't
quit working.  This was a sony tape deck (quit after 6 months), a cd player
(wasn't sony brand, but had mostly sony chips), logic failure 1 year later. 
2 sony Qic-Wide, well they required formatting quite a few times.

Well, I must say the system worked better under 2.2.14 with david hinds
pcmcia (3.1.11 I believe).  My nic is a 3com 3cxfe575ct (I hate these
numbers now).  2.2.14 I get IRQ3 for it and it doesn't have *ANY* problems. 
Under 2.3.51, I put it in slot 0, irq 10.  VGA has irq 10 (I wish I could
disable that!) and after downloading 180mb (of a 183mb file) the driver
pukes and spams my console with errors (the only way to fix is to remove the
card and reinsert).  If I stick it in slot 1, it gets irq 5 and downloading
the same file causes errors after about 90mb downloaded.
I need to add while the cardbus has irq 5, the sound skips every first write
to the drive (constant writes only triggers it at start, but it happens at
every short write).  As stated above, 2.2.14 did not do this.
The biggest problem I have with this thing is why it's always grabbing IRQs
that are already inuse as opposed to ones that are available.  I currently
have USB disabled for 2 reasons, last time I tried the driver, it just
didn't work (timeout errors), and 2, I don't have any usb devices.  So I
have irq 9 and irq 11 free.  Maybe you could have something like
yentairqlist= and list irqs that I want to use there.  I'm not sure how
windoze handles irq allocation, but I'll find out when I get to work monday.
