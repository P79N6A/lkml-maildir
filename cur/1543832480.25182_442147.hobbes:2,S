2.6.17-git7 was the last development kernel to boot on my U5.
2.6.17-git8 to -git15 all hang immediately after being loaded.
2.6.17-git16 to 2.6.18-rc1 partially boot but crash and burn in
different places depending on kernel configuration: my standard
config got alignment exceptions in the floppy driver followed by
(sabre?) PCI errors and a hang; a minimal kernel gets further but
fails "su" probe and then oopses hard when the /dev/hda partition
table is about to be printed.
I'll try to capture the kernel messages soon, but I don't have
a null-modem serial cable to the U5 yet, and my attempts to use
a digital camera only resulted in blurry pictures of the screen :-(
