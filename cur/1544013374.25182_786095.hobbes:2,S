how would you propose maintaining said list ?  attempting to maintain external 
to the file in question will just lead to rot (since we dont want to whitelist 
entire files, and we cant track line numbers, and we cant detect where the 
keyword is being used in terms of macro/function) ... that leaves two choices 
that i can think of:
 - a new __asm_userok__ type marker
 - adding a simple /* userok */ comment we can filter in the perl regex
neither of which sounds entire pleasant either ...
