That first argument is my problem, otherwise we could just define an alias
for them, which could be used in generic code. The current rule is to pass
NULL for non-PCI devices, but e.g. Amigas have a Zorro II and a Zorro III
bus, which have to be handled differently. Amiga drivers know how to deal
with this, but they can't use this API.
