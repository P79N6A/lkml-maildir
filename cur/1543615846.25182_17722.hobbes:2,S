99% of everything done by /proc/ide/ can be done in userspace by parsing
/proc/bus/pci. The remaining 1% can be done with ioctls.
The info exposed by /proc/scsi may be exposed by ioctls also, (in which
case, that too can be done entirely in userspace), however, I'm not sure
everything shown there is accessable by means other than proc parsing.
