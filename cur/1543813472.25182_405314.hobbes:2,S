Yes, netlink is something to be considered in the great untangling.
However for a sysvipc namespace ipc/mqueue.c is something that doesn't
need to be handled because that is the implementation of posix message
queues not sysv ipc.
I think I succeeded in untagling the worst of netlink in my proof of
concept implementation, but certainly there is more todo.
