Maybe is not the same as I used, but Debian's SID "mrouted" package
work by default, at least it runs ok and boots, and learns some routes.
Take into account that my setup consisted of a real ethernet interface
(eth0) and a couple of dummy interfaces (dummy0, dummy1). No real-world
configuration, but the daemon seems to work fine, and comes already
compiled and runs with no changes over 2.6.x kernels.
Greetings.
