I do not understand what you mean here.
I feel you misunderstand my comment. I said the patch is one pure big bug,
because tasklets are not serialized wrt BHs. Timer MUST. If you are going
to get rid of this must, start from editing all the code which makes this
assumption.

Pardon, your code has an effect only after this "but..." happens
and this effect is insane.

Are you going to mix use of hires and lores timers for one task?
