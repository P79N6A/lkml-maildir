Auditing it for what?  If we want to make patching safe against NMI/MCE,
I guess we need to make sure those handlers don't use any pvops, but
that seems unreasonable if they want to poke at MSRs and so on.

No, but the pv-ops patching code should have no requirement for
atomicity at all; we shouldn't be trying to patch a live instruction stream.
