As you know, Andrew generated the patch. Here goes some test results
about your OOM Killer and the Original OOm Killer. We accomplished 10
experiments for each OOM Killer and below are average values.
"Invocations" is the number of times that out_of_memory function is
called. "Selections" is the number of times that select_bad_process
function is called and "Killed" is the number of killed process.
Original OOM Killer
Invocations average = 51620/10 = 5162
Selections average = 30/10 = 3
Killed average = 38/10 = 3.8
Andrea OOM Killer
Invocations average = 213/10 = 21.3
Selections average = 213/10 = 21.3
Killed average = 52/10 = 5.2
As you can see the number of invocations reduced significantly using
your OOM Killer.
I did not know about this problem when I was moving the original
ranking algorithm to userland. As Thomaz mentioned: invocation
madness, reentrancy problems and those strange timers and counter as
now, since, last, lastkill and count. I guess that now i can put some
OOM Killer stuffs in userland in a safer manner with those problems
solved, right?
BTW, will your OOM Killer be included in the kernel tree?
BR,
Mauricio Lin.
