This appears to have been caused by the patch titled:
	NET: Add if_addrlabel.h to sanitized headers.
The patch only adds the unifdef-y entry for this header file, however 
that header was only added after 2.6.24.
It seems that this patch was submitted to -stable in error. Stephen, can 
you confirm?
Thanks,
Daniel
