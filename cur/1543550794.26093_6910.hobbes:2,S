Oh yes, I am. :) Just found yet-another-vt82c686a-bug. With heavy IDE disk
activity at UDMA66 speed the PIT (i8253) latch register gets reset to a
random value now and then. Seems like some interference inside the chip.
The time on the machine then behaves rather funny ... I wonder if this
affects other VIA chips as well or just my stepping CD silicon of the 686a.
By the way, any comments about the new VIA & AMD drivers, and the
ide-tuning.h include file?
