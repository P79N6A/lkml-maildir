Well I would, but with the assistance of Martin Bligh from IBM I've
found my bug. Major thinko - there seems to be something funky in the
440BX chipset that allowed me to do something like:
  outl(PCI_CONF1_ADDRESS(bus, 0, dev, fn), 0xCF8);
but still returned the correct PCI information! The problem was that I'd
done my own inline for the addressing and, since I wasn't using reg, I'd
left it out. Somehow I'd managed to shift the important stuff around...
Thanks to everyone who's offered suggestions and documents, it's much
appreciated.
Cheers,
Greg.
