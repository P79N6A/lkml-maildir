Thank you for your detailed explanation and patch.
I tested your patch, unfortunately it can not stop all kinds of overflow.
The esp is a user space pointer, so the user can move it. 
For example, the user defines "int i[1000];" in  the handler function.
Please run the following test program, and pay attention to "int i[1000];".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
volatile int counter = 0;
#ifdef __i386__
void print_esp()
{
	unsigned long esp;
	__asm__ __volatile__("movl %%esp, %0":"=g"(esp));
	printf("esp = 0x%08lx\n", esp);
}
#endif
void segv_handler()
{
#ifdef __i386__
	print_esp();
#endif
	int *c = NULL;
	counter++;
	printf("%d\n", counter);
	int i[1000];	// <- Pay attention here.
	*c = 1;			// SEGV
}
int main()
{
	int *c = NULL;
	char *s = malloc(SIGSTKSZ);
	stack_t stack;
	struct sigaction action;
	memset(s, 0, SIGSTKSZ);
	stack.ss_sp = s;
	stack.ss_flags = 0;
	stack.ss_size = SIGSTKSZ;
	int error = sigaltstack(&stack, NULL);
	if (error) {
		printf("Failed to use sigaltstack!\n");
		return -1;
	}
	memset(&action, 0, sizeof(action));
	action.sa_handler = segv_handler;
	action.sa_flags = SA_ONSTACK | SA_NODEFER;
	sigemptyset(&action.sa_mask);
	sigaction(SIGSEGV, &action, NULL);
	*c = 0;			//SEGV
	if (!s)
		free(s);
	return 0;
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, the patch I posted is still needed 
Surely, adding a variable to sched.h is not a good idea. 
Could you tell me a better place to store the previous esp?
Here is a new patch rebased on 2.6.24-rc3-git2.
