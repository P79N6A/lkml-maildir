Is aac_slave_configure only called for disk devices?  If its called for
all scsi devices, then the queue depth will always be set to something a
lot less than 512.  I did some searching through the scsi code and I see
only two places that cmd_per_lun is used. It is used to set the queue
depth in scsi_track_queue_full and scsi_alloc_sdev. So it seems that, if
aac_slave_configure gets called for all scsi devices, that setting
cmd_per_lun in the aacraid scsi host template to 1 would be OK.  Does
that make sense or did I miss something?
Thanks,
Mark.
