Nonotify uses ioctl mainly for 'pragmatical' reasons. A syscall would be
technically better - that's for sure, actually it was my initial idea to
use one (or to change the stat-call).
But i didn't want to bother people with asking to assign me a
syscall-number before even knowing if they like my idea. And changing it
to use a syscall lateron would be no problem at all from the concept of
nonotify.
Also - as a kernel newbie - i didn't find any good documentation how to
add my own syscall into the kernel. I just wanted to get nonotify
working as an 'optional patch', without changing tons of files.
But you could help me if you have a look at my ioctl function. I'm using
a structure which contains a char* pointer and four timespec fields. Do
you know if this causes problems with 32/64bit compatibility.
Thanks,
Norbert
