Please forgive my obtuseness, but I am unable to conceive of
one (beyond checking that your routing is symmetrical :-)
Could you elaborate?

So when lightning fries the primary ethcard in the machine,
I have to know the hw address of the second card to get in?
Also, it can be used to scan through a dual-homed host to
determine the address range in use on the other side, which
I'd rather wasn't possible.
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/\"correct\"_arp_reply_interface_selection
maybe?
Matthew.
