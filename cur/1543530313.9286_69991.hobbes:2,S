That's clever.
And while we're at it:
I really, really wish that MUAs (esp. Pine and Elm) would implement the
rfc822 'References:' option.  This is so MUAs which _know_ how to do a
topological sort can present messages sensibly.  This would be
particularly useful for reading Alan's stuff because his mailer fails to
implement 'References' _and_ he like to remove the inline attribution.
This, and a resolution of the utterly abysmal lag at vger would make
lkml a more pleasant place to be.
