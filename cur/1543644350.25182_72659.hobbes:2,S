We have removed locks (code now atomically reserves space in the trace
buffer), significantly reduced the cost of taking timestamps by using the
real-time clock, and are in the process of implementing per-CPU buffers.
As per previous email, the intent is to get only the core infrastructure
into the kernel and keep trace points as patches.  Some of the work going
into LTT is modeled after the tracing infrastructure in K42, which is
extremely lightweight, lock-free, and designed for multiprocessors.
