Subject: [PATCH] IDE dma reset for sl82c105
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have found that the IDE controller on a w83c553f (a sl82c105 function) 
can get into a hung state if the interrupt line is wired to INTC and a 
timeout occurs.  The following patch implements a hard reset for the 
controller as documented in a Windbond engineering notice.
This patch needs some testing and there appears to be no maintainer for 
the sl83c105 IDE driver :(.  The conditions to repeat the problem are 
that the controller must be wired for PCI INTC, DMA must be in use, and 
a timeout error must occur (try mounting a music CD).  My fix checks for 
INTC configuration so hopefully this patch will only affect systems that 
exhibit the hang.  I have tested it on an IBM pSeries model 610 which 
has the hardware operating in this mode.
The patch should apply to 2.5.13 - 2.5.16 (at least).
