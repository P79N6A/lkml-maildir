Yes, please. Is it the paper by P. Rogaway, cited in the paper on
Counter mode, submitted to NIST's "Modes of Operation" workshop?

My copy of A.C. says: "While the IV should be unique for each message
encrypted with the same key, it is not an absolute requirement."
On the other hand, Counter mode trivially _requires_ different IVs
because if two IVs are the same under the same key, the bitstream that
CTR mode generates will be identical. Not good.

The IV would not contain any key material. If you have a cipher with a
128 bit key and you need 64 bits of IV, you simply request 192 bits of
"key", use the lower third for the IV and the upper third as the key.
