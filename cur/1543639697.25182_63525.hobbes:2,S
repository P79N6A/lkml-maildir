Well, all reads are synchronous, in a way....
In this case, where the application's data-processing bandwidth is
vastly higher than the media bandwidth, readahead isn't doing anything
useful, apart from allowing the submission of nice big chunks to the IO
layers.  Batching.
If the application is processing data more slowly then readahead
will allow the IO to be overlapped with that processing.  But with
rsize < PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, all NFS reads are synchronous and everything
has gone bad.   It may be sensible for NFS to disable readahead
in this case.

2.4 will schedule readahead whether or not the requested page is
uptodate.  Same in 2.5.
2.4 readahead has an explicit "don't do more readahead if the 
current page is still under IO", whereas 2.5 has "don't readahead
pages in a previously-submitted window".  They'll have the same
effect.
