So I was looking at a patch for ACPI_SLEEP that went around a moment ago,
and ended up doing a 'make menuconfig'.
I do a '/ACPI_SLEEP' inside that, and I get this output:
x Symbol: ACPI_SLEEP [=n]                                                 x  
  x Prompt: Sleep States                                                    x  
  x   Defined at drivers/acpi/Kconfig:49                                    x  
  x   Depends on: !X86_NUMAQ && !X86_VISWS && !IA64_HP_SIM && (IA64 || X86) x  
  x   Location:                                                             x  
  x     -> Power management options                                         x  
  x       -> Power Management support (PM [=y])                             x  
  x         -> ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support    x  
  x           -> ACPI Support (ACPI [=y])   
Only problem is that drivers/acpi/Kconfig:49 says:
config ACPI_SLEEP
        bool "Sleep States"
        depends on X86 && (!SMP || SUSPEND_SMP)
        depends on PM
        default y
Can somebody explain why I'm seeing the different Depends on in the two places?
