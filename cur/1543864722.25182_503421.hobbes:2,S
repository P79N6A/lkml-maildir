Agreed. That was my reasoning for proposing the earlier patch that xor'ed
it with a random value (though that's pretty thin protection too).
I think in hindsight though, just pulling the patch that hashes pipefs
inodes is probably the best thing for now. At some point in the future,
if we decide it's enough of a problem, we can always revisit it.
I'm still planning to look over other callers of new_inode to make a
determination about them wrt to i_ino uniqueness. Many of them are not
as performance sensitive as pipefs, and it might not be such a big deal
to just hash those.
