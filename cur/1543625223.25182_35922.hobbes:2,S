To preempt anyone else objecting to this...
I mean, given that we have a CRC on jffs2 nodes anyway, so the chances of
any accidentally corrupted input actually being fed to the decompressor
are virtually zero, it's not worth patching the 2.4.19 zlib when I want to
put the shared zlib into 2.4.20 anyway.
I'm not going to object to anyone else doing so, but I can't be bothered
to do it myself, as it would have virtually zero benefit and would mean
I'd have to update the shared-zlib patches for 2.4.
Infinitely more people (i.e. at least one) have been bitten by the fact
that you can't build both ppp_deflate and jffs2 into a 2.4 kernel.
