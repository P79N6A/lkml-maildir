Yes, they are treated the same.  If any part of the request is to be waited
upon then the whole request should be treated as synchronous.
And if no part of a readahead request is waited upon, we should never have
submited it anyway.

The simplified assumption that "reads are waited upon and writes are not" is
highly accurate.
I want to see the Linux I/O scheduler work as well as possible with workloads
which make that assumption 100% true.  Once we have done that, then we can
start worrying about corner cases like AIO, O_SYNC, truncate, etc.
