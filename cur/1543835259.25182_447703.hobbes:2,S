And there are no other devices that consume 0x1600-0x161F?  Interesting.
I wonder what Windows does to bind drivers to the LPC devices?  Do they
have to do the same SMBIOS OEM string hack?

I guess as long as they change the OEM string the same time they change
the EC/accelerometer/battery/kitchen-sink implementation, you're OK :-)
It just feels like living on borrowed time.
