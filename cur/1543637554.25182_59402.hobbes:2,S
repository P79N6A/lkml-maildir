Yes that's Vojtech in action. They don't just hurt my eyes. More 
importantly - they interferre with the usage of folding in some editors.
So please consider a style change. (And using FB if console is to narrow
for you. vga=0x318 always worked for me. No GNOME, no KDE, just X11 + 
MWM is a good terminal launcher as well - even if rebooting frequently.)
However: Please note that I greatly welcome that Vojtech
actually *does* good commenting in exceptionally *exemplary* 
comprehensive and adequate style!
