Here's a saying for you:
	"Only stupid people are black or white. The real world isn't".
Anyway, look at the particular document we're talking about. We're talking 
about the kernel standard coding-style.
Within that one, 8-char tabs are standard. Within that one, "u8" is 
standard. Within that one, typedefs are frowned upon.
In other contexts, other things are standard. Live with it.
