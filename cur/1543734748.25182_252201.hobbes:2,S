No, in general races of the form "permissions were altered after I
checked them" can happen.

Checking that system calls succeeded is a minimum requirement at all
times. Misinterpreting error returns is the app's fault.

Irritating. That must mean you can't ask for specific fields.

If you can't ask for specific fields you're dead anyway.

ESRCH and ENOENT sound good.

This is the bit about being dead already if you can't request subsets
of fields and/or one field at a time.

Well, "return this set of fields" means there's only one type of
request necessary, and userspace merely iterates through the subsets
obtained by striking out fields to which accesses caused errors until
either the set is empty or the call succeeds. One field at a time at
all times also means there's only one type of request necessary. So I
don't see overengineering happening here, merely that "either all
succeed or all fail" is a semantic that creates hardships for userspace;
both the alternatives are simple.
