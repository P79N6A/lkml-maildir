this looks like a sign that the kernel you're using is configured to try
to use
harddisk DMA right at boot.  That *could* cause problems in rare cases.
SectorIdNotFound looks like a bad sector on the harddisk though.
looks like you can't get into linux at all... try scandisk from windows
on Thorough setting (have to format linux partition as fat32 first).
