hi,
after some sleuthing, i found that the file:
usb-Makefile-2.4.21-pre6.patch
located at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/usb/2.4/
contains the changes necessary to fix the static build.
it didn't apply cleanly on my stock 2.4.21-pre6, but the changes
are simple enough to add in by hand.
i have it statically compiled into my kernel now and everything's
working fine.
hope this helps.
leon.
