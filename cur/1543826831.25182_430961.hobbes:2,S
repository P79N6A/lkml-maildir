The usual place nowadays seems to be in /lib/firmware/
Depends on your distribution though.  If you are using
hotplug rather than udev, you can find a list of firmware
directories in hotplug's firmware script.

If the cxacru module is being loaded from an initrd, then it
may not be able to find the firmware if the root filesystem
hasn't been mounted yet.  In that case the simplest thing is
probably to place the firmware appropriately in the initrd.
