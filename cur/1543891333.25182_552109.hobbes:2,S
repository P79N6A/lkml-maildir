I don't think it should. The Linux kernel is not trying to be
a BIOS replacement and should not know everything about the platforms
it runs on.   We sometimes try to work around very common
bugs, but this one (involving lots of memory and special configuration)
seems to be more in the exotic range where command line options
or waiting for a BIOS update seem better options.
