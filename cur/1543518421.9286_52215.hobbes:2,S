No, if changed at all, it should be:
	if (atomic_read(&sem->count) == 0)
		wake_up(&sem->wait);
And the paranoid BUG() case would just be an additional
	if (atomic_read(&sem->count) > 0)
		BUG();
Ie, the current code is correct assuming that count has not been corrupted
to be > 0 at this point, which it can't be since write_bias_granted will
only be called if an atomic operation on sem->count resulted in the zero
flag being set.  Having count < 0 means that someone else has already
biased the lock and therefore we don't want to perform the wakeup.

At this point the lock is unbiased, and this will wake up one or more
readers (since they're not exclusive) and one writer (assuming lots of
contention, which is the only case for which stampedes are interesting).
Ideally, only 1 process would be woken up here to bias the lock, but we
can't since readers *must* be added non-exclusively.
