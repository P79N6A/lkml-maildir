First please always send cleanup patches separately. I think you have more
than just the C99 conversion.
Were you even able to compile it? Since ip27 is ia64 only that would need 
an IA64 cross compiler or a native ia64 machine.
It's probably better to focus on drivers only that actually build
on x86 :- see 
http://www.halobates.de/allyes
 for a compile log
showing all buildable files for x86-64 and i386.
Other than that the patch looks ok to me, but I haven't tried to 
compile it either.
