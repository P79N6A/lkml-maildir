Subject: [PATCH 0/6] RFC: use include/asm-generic/bitops.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Large number of boilerplate bit operations written in C-language
are scattered around include/asm-*/bitops.h.
These patch series gather them into include/asm-generic/bitops.h. And
- kill duplicated code and comment (about 4000lines)
- use better C-language equivalents
- help porting new architecture (now include/asm-generic/bitops.h is not
  referenced from anywhere)
