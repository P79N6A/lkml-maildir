wrong. We actively _preempt_ processes on other CPUs, this means that a
preempted process has all rights to try to replace even lesser priority
processes on other CPUs. Your problem might be that you are thinking in
terms of dual-CPU boxes, i'm using a quad one. (btw, even on a dual box it
is possible to 'push' a process to another CPU, although it's not the
common case)
