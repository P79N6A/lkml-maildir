Ok now it works. (Just like with the old sonypi :-)
However, there are some things that remain unresolved:
- the "mousewheel" reports only once every 2 seconds when constantly
  wheeling (in mev)
- pressing the jogdial button produces a keyboard event (keycode 158) 
  rather than a mousebutton 3 event
BTW, how can I use the Fn keys on console (keycodes 466-477) for arbitrary 
shell commands?
Such a feature, among which special combinations like Ctrl+Alt+Del also 
belong, are handled by the kernel which leaves almost no room for 
user-defined userspace action. Any idea?
