Hmm, maybe Linux should use Microsoft's ".inf" file syntax?  %-)
That's one thing that it achieves, at the cost of serious chaos
when the files with the device IDs get out of sync with the
drivers they supposedly work with.

It'd be good if we had ways that user mode tools can request drivers be
bound and un-bound.  "usbfs" has some support for that, not exactly
packaged in the way I'd most like (and "usbfs" is problematic too).

I'd rather not try swapping ID tables ... likely better to keep some
of that information compiled in to the drivers, but also ADD ways that
user mode tools can modify the bindings that the kernel does (or doesn't)
establish.  Unless someone wants to get radical and insist that ONLY the
user mode tools can define such policies (after bootstrapping is done).
Of course Greg's example of a Palm could be addressed using current
infrastructure and module parameters, with "wildcard" binding (to
make sure the driver can see if the device matches the parameters).
