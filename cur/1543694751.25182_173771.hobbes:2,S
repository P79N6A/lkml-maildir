Hi,
I've been playing with the suspend features of 2.6.0-test7-mm1 and I 
can't get it to work. When I do "echo -n standby > /sys/power/state", 
the screen flickers briefly and then the system is back to normal. In 
the logs I see the following message:
Oct 20 10:18:12 hansolo kernel: PM: Preparing system for suspend
Oct 20 10:18:12 hansolo kernel: Stopping tasks: 
============================================================================|
Oct 20 10:18:12 hansolo kernel: Restarting tasks... done
Now, I wonder, what is causing the kernel to exit from the suspend 
immediately? Is it error in suspend code, drivers that doesn't support 
suspend or some program that is interrupting the sleep? How do I debug 
this further?
More hw/software info available on request, please CC me on any replies.
Kind regards,
David Härdeman
