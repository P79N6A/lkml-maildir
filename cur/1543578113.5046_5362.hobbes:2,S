then you'll love the zerocopy patch :-) Just use sendfile() or specify
MSG_NOCOPY to sendmsg(), and you'll see effective memory-to-card
DMA-and-checksumming on cards that support it.
the discussion with Stephen is about various device-to-device schemes.
(which Mosix i dont think wants to use. Mosix wants to use memory to
device zero-copy, right?)
