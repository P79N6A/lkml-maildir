This is what I'm currently doing with all new -mm kernels. There's a lot
of signed vs unsigned comparison all over the kernel as well as unsigned
values being compared to negative values, missing initializers, and a lot
of other minor stuff.
I'm slowly trying to clean up what I find...
I'm most likely not going to be able to clean it /all/ up, and it's a slow
process for me, but I'll be posting patches whenever I think I've got
something cleaned up correctly.
