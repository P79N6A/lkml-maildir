Thanks Greg, that did the trick.
What the value of FW_ACTION_NOHOTPLUG?  If I specify that instead of 
FW_ACTION_HOTPLUG, I presume I don't get automatic loading of the firwmare via 
the hotplug subsystem, but request_firmware() still times out.  Why would I ever 
not want to take advantage of hotplug?
