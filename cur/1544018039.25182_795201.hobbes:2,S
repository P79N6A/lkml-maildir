usr/include/linux/videodev.h is giving 2 warnings in 'make headers_check':
 usr/include/linux/videodev.h:19: leaks CONFIG_VIDEO to userspace where it is not valid
 usr/include/linux/videodev.h:314: leaks CONFIG_VIDEO to userspace where it is not valid
Whole file is covered with #if defined(CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT) || !defined (__KERNEL__)
It means this file is only valid for kernel mode if CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT is defined but in user mode it is always valid.
		
Can we choose some better alternative Or can we use this file as:
#ifdef CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT
#include <linux/videodev.h>
#endif
Thanks
