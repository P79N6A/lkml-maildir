except I just noticed I got it wrong: it's netdev@vger.kernel.org, and
I omitted the "vger" part. That's what is expected when posting before
caffeine :-)
Feel free to repost the whole issue overthere (along with your new tests)
if you don't get useful replies in a few days.

What caught my attention was the usual "3s delay", which is purely TCP
and application-independant.

I'm sure it's a client issue too, that's why it would be reasonable to
be able to try without conntrack. Can't you use a TCP proxy instead of
REDIRECT ? Also, you said that you also noticed the same behaviour in
other environments, maybe there you can disable conntrack ?
