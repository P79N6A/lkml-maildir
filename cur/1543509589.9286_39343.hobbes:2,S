That is not an NFS server message, that's an NFS client message. I
get a lot of those too on our 2.2.x NFS clients:
nfs_dentry_delete: cur/937437860.20061.janeway:2,ST: ino=556190393, count=2, nlink=1
To be honest, I have no idea what they mean. They bug me as well, it
fills up my kern.log syslog file :/
Mike.
