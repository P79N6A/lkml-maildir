I suppose this performance problem may show up in other places too where
this simple workaround is not possible. Is there any non-negotiable deep
reason why fsync on large fils must be slow? Once 2.2 has stabilazed I
suppose performance tuning in the 2.2 and 2.3 trees will be interesting to
many developers.
