I told him that I would stop speaking to him in regard to this issue. It
just makes it impossible to send him a kernel patch. What I find really
interesting is that he did not just block me but the entire domain.
So now we will have to send our patches to the kernel mailing list, setup
out own mailing list and web pages.  It is not a problem since we already
have a web site setup.
