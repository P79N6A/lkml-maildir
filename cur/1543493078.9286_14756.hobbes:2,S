When you say the 'latest NFSv3 patch': which one do you mean? They're
unfortunately not quite stable yet 8-(...
 If it doesn't work with the 0.7.2 patch, do you think you could
provide me with a tcpdump of the NFS traffic between the client and
server? I think the problems of flushing of write requests is fixed
now.
Cheers,
