*sigh*.  how about this -- its safe to always call the exit stubs.  they
just call sock_unregister which always suceeds.  actually i see very 
few protocol families check the return code from sock_register() --
should i ignore the return code as well?
static int __init atm_init(void)
{
        int error;
        if ((error = atmpvc_init()) < 0) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "atmpvc_init() failed with %d\n", error);
                goto failure;
        }
        if ((error = atmsvc_init()) < 0) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "atmsvc_init() failed with %d\n", error);
                goto failure;
        }
#ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS
        if ((error = atm_proc_init()) < 0) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "atm_proc_init() failed with %d\n",error);
                goto failure;
        }
#endif
        return 0;
failure:
        atmsvc_exit();
        atmpvc_exit();
        return error;
}
