Subject: [2.6 patch] arch/i386/mach-voyager/voyager_cat.c: named initializers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/10/224

This patch switches arch/i386/mach-voyager/voyager_cat.c to using named 
initializers for struct resource.
Besides a fixing compile error in -mm, it makes the code better 
readable.
