For kernel developers which are BitKeeper users, 
auto-bk-get is an on-demand 'bk get' libc wrapper tool.
It means that you don't need to run 'bk -r get' in order to build 
the kernel. Instead, you just run 'make config' or 'make bzImage', 
using auto-bk-get in a clean repository and auto-bk-get will 
only 'bk get' the files you need from the repository (one of my
test cases showed only 2800 out of 14000 files were checked out). 
It also supports building in an entirely different directory, 
taking the files from a repository somewhere else.
To download and compile auto-bk-get:
# bk clone 
http://auto-bk-get.bkbits.net/auto-bk-get
# cd auto-bk-get
# make
Read the README file.
