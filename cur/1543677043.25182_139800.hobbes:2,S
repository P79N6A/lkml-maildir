It seems that gcc 3.3 doesn't like the cs46xx driver and causes and error.
The quick fix was to change the following lines
line 948-952
struct InitStruct
{
    u32 long off;
    u32 long val;
}
to
struct InitStruct
{
    u32 off;
    u32 val;
}
I am not sure this is the exact fix to use but it works. Anyway to getting
this fixed?
