Hi,
  Somewhere between test12 and test13pre4ac2 (sheesh the version
numbers.....) CSS on ATAPI DVD ROM drives has stopped working.
Playing a CSS disc (using xine) causes a complete system hang (machine
doesn't ping - sysrq-b still works) on test13pre4ac2.  On test12 it is
still OK.
This is on an Alpha LX164.
Dave
