Not yet, sorry. This patch was simply decoupling the power state
of the device from its physical presence in the slot. It had 
nothing to do about programming p2p bridges and subordinate
devices correctly.
I know some folks from Fujitsu are working on this and should
be sending out patches shortly. Not sure if these will support
docking stations fully but even if they don't, we'll have a better
starting base to build on.
