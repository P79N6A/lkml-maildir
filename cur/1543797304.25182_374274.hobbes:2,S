bugzilla is probably the best example of why human-managed "databases"
are never 100% accurate and need lots of mainteinance 8) (take a look
at mozilla's or kernel's bugzilla...). I'm tracking manually some 
of the new devices supported in 
http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org/LinuxChanges
but there're so many changes under drivers/* that god knows how many
things I am missing. Expecting that people will maintain a wiki or a
buzgilla or anything similar properly is like expecting that people
will document or compile-test their patches before submitting them :P
I think that the infrastructure for building such database automatically
is already there: In the same way MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is used by hotplug
& friends to load the right module you can use MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE to
build a database of the devices supported by a kernel compiled with
"make allmodconfig", parse it and put it in a web page.
