Subject: [PATCH] Remove unnecessary #GP after flush_thread()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/5/272

During execve(), we seem to have a window between flush_thread() and start_thread() where %gs = 0x33, but cpu_gdt_table[cpu][6] == 0. This causes an unnecessary #GP fault on __switch_to() if there is a context switch during the window. But most people are not noticing it because of the fixup in loadsegment().
Specifically, this BUG() was triggered during normal execution.

                loadsegment(gs, next->gs);
This patch sets %gs = 0 _before_ the thread.tls_array is zeroed.
