All callers of bld_pools() need the pooldata lock - taking
it inside that function makes the code a little more readable..
Also I'd suggest to rename bld_pools() to build_pools() ;)

Could you explain this change?  And it's affect on non-NUMA IA64
machines?

Who do you guarantee this is atomic?  Please make it fit
Documentation/CodyingStyle, btw..

Hmm, shouldn't those [MAX_NUMNODES] arrays be in some per-node array
to avoid cacheline-bouncing?

Why not a simple spin_lock()?

Urgg.  I'd suggest you switch to RCU now and make your patch apply
ontop of it - another reason to apply the RCU core patch..

Dito for spin_unlock.

spin_trylock..
All in all your code doesn't seem to be very cachelign-friendly,
lots of global bouncing.  Do you have any numbers on what your
patch changes for normal SMP configurations?
