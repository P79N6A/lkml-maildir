This isn't an example of a per-device breakage, though. It only shows up 
on some devices, but the cause is apparently the chipset. Those devices 
work fine on other boards.
As mentioned later, it appears that CRS stuff might be related to this 
problem, but if it couldn't be fixed, I think the only sane solution 
would be to blacklist MMCONFIG support on that chipset.
