I upgraded a Dell PowerEdge 2200 server with Adaptec 2940U SCSI adapter
and software RAID1 from 2.2.11 to 2.2.12pre3 in an effort to have a kernel
with the TCP memory leak fixed.  However, I had some problems with the
RAID arrays and even with the SCSI devices.
During bootup, the RAID arrays went through a forced check even though the
system was cleanly shut down.  I confess I was in a hurry to get this
system up and didn't see all the bootup messages, but I believe RAID
failed to come up after the forced check.  I definitely saw my disks
wouldn't mount; the message was 'Operation not supported' even for
non-RAID partitions.  Everything worked fine after reverting to 2.2.11.  
I'd be willing to try going to 2.2.12 again but first I wonder if I need
any higher version of the RAID tools. The version currently on that system
is raidtools 0.42.
Thanks,
