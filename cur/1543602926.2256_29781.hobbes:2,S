And if did? So now semantics is "it somehow works in presence of FS
modifications, but not completely"?
I look at it this way: ability to survive filesystem modifications
would be nice, but it is quite hard to do. (Probably bigger diff than
what I have, now.)
Admitedly, it would also be nice to be able for kernel *to survive
arbitrary fs modifications without suspend-to-disk* -- imagine two
machines sharing one SCSI disk. No other suspend-to-disk
implementation I know of does what you describe. So I treat problems
orthogonal. What you want is usefull (you can do forced unmount that
way), but it is not required for software suspend.
