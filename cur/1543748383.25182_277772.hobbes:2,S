        Hi, 
 here is what iptraf gathers about iface stats:
 Packet Size (bytes)      Count     Packet Size (bytes)     Count x

This is the result of about 20 secs of gathering time.
The average throuput by scp is about 15kb/s. On a 100mbit switched net. 
BTW, the net itself is perfectly ok. ;-)
Thats alot, isn't it? (Horrible)

PS: As soon as possible I will try to fix interrupts and iface-card
pci positions.
The thing about PCI edge is not a BIOS option.
