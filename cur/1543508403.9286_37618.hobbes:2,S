while scanning the archives I noticed the thread on teh 2.2.12 mem
leak...

Is this bug only evident if you are using innd?  is it platform
specific? ( Intel here)
I am using 2.2.12 , and have been up for 9 days, 12 hour, no crashes
oops etc (knock on wood)
The only noticable problems I have had is with netscape resolving DNS.
This only seems to happen when I start up ppp.  After I connect, if
I try to browse my hostname (configured to do so), there is a 2 minute
pause. This only happens after connection thru ppp. The system is
configured to look in hosts first then DNS, but it seems like it is
going thru DNS then hosts.  The other problems is things seem to have
slowed down, X redraw in particular.  Could this be related? Since
I have such a low load on my machine (dev workstation idle at night)
could it just be much less evident?
