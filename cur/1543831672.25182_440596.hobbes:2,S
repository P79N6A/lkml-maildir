Sure this won't help, but just in case... my board:
http://www.asrock.com/product/939Dual-SATA2.htm
"Chipset  	- Northbridge: ULi M1695
                    - Southbridge: ULI M1567"
PCI ID of Southbridge in lspci output below looks like 5289
00:00.0 Host bridge: ALi Corporation M1695 K8 Northbridge [PCI Express
and HyperTransport]
00:01.0 PCI bridge: ALi Corporation: Unknown device 524b
00:02.0 PCI bridge: ALi Corporation: Unknown device 524c
00:04.0 Host bridge: ALi Corporation M1689 K8 Northbridge [Super K8 Single Chip]
00:05.0 PCI bridge: ALi Corporation AGP8X Controller
00:06.0 PCI bridge: ALi Corporation M5249 HTT to PCI Bridge
00:07.0 ISA bridge: ALi Corporation M1563 HyperTransport South Bridge (rev 70)
00:07.1 Bridge: ALi Corporation M7101 Power Management Controller [PMU]
00:11.0 Ethernet controller: ALi Corporation M5263 Ethernet Controller (rev 40)
00:12.0 IDE interface: ALi Corporation M5229 IDE (rev c7)
00:12.1 IDE interface: ALi Corporation ULi 5289 SATA (rev 10)
00:13.0 USB Controller: ALi Corporation USB 1.1 Controller (rev 03)
00:13.1 USB Controller: ALi Corporation USB 1.1 Controller (rev 03)

Justin: I'm using 2.6.17.1 and the sata_uli driver seems to be
handling the SATA drives just fine. But as I say, it's a different
southbridge, so apologies if I'm just contributing to the noise :o)
Not sure if this is comprehensive: 
http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/iii/?i=10b9
It doesn't appear to list the M1575's pci id there.
