My linux has got the Redmond disease :-(
Maybe it's becase it's standing next to a lot of NT's, but anyway...
I'm quite unsure where to send this oops, since I haven't found out what
causes it ( except that it maybe has smthg. to do with the swap). I'd like
a litte additional information, about how to aid the debugging process -
or a clue to whether it might be a hardware error or smthg. like that. Or
eventully a hint saying that I might solve the problem by upgrading to
NT ... nah not that I think
I've concluded the report in three different parts:
OOPS decription
SYSTEM description
RUNNING decription
- after thouroghly reading the /usr/src/linux/Doc*/oops*
OOPS DESCR. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The regulartity of the crashes is giving max 2 or 3 days uptime. The
syslog doesn't report any kernel oopses but the screen dump is something
like:
Oops: 0000

Running through ksymoops doesn't yield very much - at least not for a
kernel illiterate person such as I:
[root@gatekeeper ksymoops]# cat ~/oops | ./ksymoops  -v

The machine performs as a proxy and gateway running squid-2.1.PATCH2. I
don't think the machine is very heavily loaded since it's only getting 
1000hits/min on the top and usually has a lower load. It is dimensioned to
have a higher load, but people tends to avoid unstable proxies if they
can... the load in therms of netw.-througput I estimate to be appx.:
less than 1Mbit on peak . It does though use up a lot of filedescriptors,
which was the reason for upgrading to kernel 2.2.* it couldn't get the
filehandle patch to work :-( for 2.0.36.
Besides the squid proxy the machine has:
tis firewall toolkit with
  telnet 
  ftp 
  pop3 
  realplayer 
  nntp 
    -proxies
apache webserver for interfacing the statistics (only for administration)
socks 4
socks 5
  
+ some other RH things...
