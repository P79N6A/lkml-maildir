And besides, I only see the input I type, not the output of f.ex a command (on /dev/tty2). I want to monitor users and log everything that is done on a specific tty when they log in. 
This is in debian:

Description: TTY Snoop - allows you to spy on telnet+serial connections
 TTYSnoop allows you to snoop on login tty's through another tty-device or
 pseudo-tty. The snoop-tty becomes a 'clone' of the original tty,
 redirecting both input and output from/to it.
