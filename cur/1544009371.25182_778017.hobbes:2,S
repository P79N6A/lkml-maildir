About the .config file :
cat config-2.6.26-1-amd64(unaffected/silent debian unstable based on
2.6.26.8) | grep MCE
CONFIG_X86_MCE=y
CONFIG_X86_MCE_INTEL=y
CONFIG_X86_MCE_AMD=y
cat config-2.6.27.8-nodbg001(affected, built by me) | grep MCE
CONFIG_X86_MCE=y
CONFIG_X86_MCE_INTEL=y
CONFIG_X86_MCE_AMD=y
I have an ati hd4850 1GB. It's not supported by the current x.org
server on my distro(7.3(I tried 7.4 in experimental, but hard lock
up)), so x uses the vesa driver. On 2.6.27.8(affected) I get this :
cat config-2.6.27.8-nodbg001 | grep RADEON
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m
CONFIG_FB_RADEON=m
CONFIG_FB_RADEON_I2C=y
CONFIG_FB_RADEON_BACKLIGHT=y
# CONFIG_FB_RADEON_DEBUG is not set
But lsmod gives this :

I can't find anything related to radeon or ati in here, so I guess
that the kernel too has loaded a vesa driver?
