Sure, but in general such first-time posters are pretty polite, or at
least, non-inflammatory, and as a result the responses are (usually)
fairly polite and helpful.
So while I sympathize with what you're saying, I find it pretty hard to
feel sorry for the original poster in this case.
[On a forum _intended_ for user support answers will be restrained and
polite no matter how boneheaded the request, but you really can't expect
every forum to be like that -- it's just not human nature.]
