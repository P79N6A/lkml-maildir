Would that I could. No, this particular monster seems to be a
comparative rarity.

I'll put the patch on so if the behaviour recurs I'll have more info for 
you. FWIW this machine is constantly busy doing egcs test runs so
hopefully it will break again at some time :)
FWIW it might be a good idea to output information like this for all
`this can never happen' errors, where it's vaguely obvious what
information would be likely to be relevant; such errors are likely to be
rare so it's useful to have as much information available as possible
without having to replicate it to get useful information out.

Didn't I give you that already? Attached again. (This is for 2.2.5 FWIW, 
I've just upgraded.)

Agreed. FWIW about six hours after that behaviour I had a rash of
processes stuck in D state in one of the  __down_failed functions; I
think __down_failed_interruptible. However this *was* all back in 2.2.3, 
remember, and I distinctly remember the semaphore code being attacked
around that time.
Patch applied anyway, it can't do any harm and may be useful.
My .config follows, with extraneous comments chopped out: (at the time
of the Great OOM autofs was not included, but all else is the same as it 
was then)
