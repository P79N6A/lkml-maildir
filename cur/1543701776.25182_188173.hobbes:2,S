The problem with poll/select is not the Linux implementation. It is the 
API that is flawed when applied to large fd sets. Every call pass to the 
system the whole fd set, and this makes the API O(N) by definition. While 
poll/select are perfectly ok for small fd sets, epoll LT might enable the 
application to migrate from poll/select to epoll pretty quickly (if the 
application architecture is fairly sane). For example, it took about 15 
minutes to me to make an epoll'd thttpd.
