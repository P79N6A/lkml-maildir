It can't return NULL in this context because we just checked
skb_queue_empty() with the socket lock held and llc_wait_data()
will return zero only if skb_queue_empty() is false.
I know it's hard for automated tools to see this, but it's not
reasonable to put this extra check in there since it is
superfluous due to the above mentioned invariants.
