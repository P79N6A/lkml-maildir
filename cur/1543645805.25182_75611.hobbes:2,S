Oh, Grace,
Did you search for it?  It's easy to find it.
Examples:
* Intel's e1000 web page:
  
http://www.intel.com/support/network/adapter/1000/linux/e1000.htm
* Linux Cross Reference web pages (for 2.5.38 in this case):
  
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/net/e1000/?v=2.5.38
If you would go to  
http://www.google.com/linux
and enter "intel e1000 driver",
it will gladly find it (and tons of other stuff) for you.
