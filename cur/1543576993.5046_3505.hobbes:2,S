Hi and Happy New Year,
I've just compiled and tested 2.4.0-prerelease. My AX25 (hamradio) system does
not work with this new release. There is a timing problem. When a fram is sent
on the air, the frame is VERY long (switched off by the watchdog of my drsi
card) and contains no data. On this point of vue, the previous test version was
right.
My system :
-----------
K6-2 500 / 128Mb
Kernel modules         2.3.24
Gnu C                  2.95.2
