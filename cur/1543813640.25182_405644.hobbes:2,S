Hi Andrew!
Congratulations! The kernel from scsi-rc-fixes git and your patch are
working.
By the way, could you, please, tell me how I get only scsi patches
from the git repository, cause I got the whole kernel by using
cg-clone 
http://kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-rc-fixes-2.6.git
Now the process looks like following:
Mar 11 23:54:22 multipath kernel: qla2xxx 0000:03:01.0: LOOP DOWN detected (2).
Mar 11 23:54:28 multipath kernel:  rport-4:0-0: blocked FC remote port time out:
 removing target and saving binding
Mar 11 23:54:37 multipath kernel: qla2xxx 0000:03:01.0: LIP reset occured (f7f7).
Mar 11 23:54:37 multipath kernel: qla2xxx 0000:03:01.0: LOOP UP detected (2 Gbps).
Mar 11 23:54:59 multipath kernel:  4:0:0:0: timing out command, waited 22s
And the disks appear.
Could you tell me, please, where this 22sec timeout came from?
Again, congratulations for good work!
Thanks much,
Maxim.
