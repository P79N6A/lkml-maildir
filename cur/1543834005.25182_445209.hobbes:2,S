Okay, thanks. But I think it'd be more consistant if all devices that
have js* entries would have the relaxed perms in event*. Looking at
joydev.c, that seems to be devices where EV_ABS && (ABS_X || ABS_WHEEL
|| ABS_THROTTLE) && !(EV_KEY && BTN_TOUCH).
There's another problem, too:
Some distros (Fedora, Mandriva...) don't use groups with /dev/input/jsX,
they use pam_console to chmod the device to the console owner.
Unfortunately, it allows to specify the permissions based on device file
names only.
To solve this problem, I see two solutions:
1. Have the pam_console_apply program extended so that it can perform
more complex matches (but what kind of matches would those be?).
2. Have udev create symlinks like the following case:
/dev/input/event3
/dev/input/js0
/dev/input/jsevent0 => event3
Then pam_console_apply could match jsevent[0-9]* and it would follow the
symlink, thus chowning event3 to the wanted user.
Unfortunately neither look too good to me. Do you have any other ideas?

I thought of that too, but I thought it's too big a security risk, as
it's not guaranteed that somebody else won't temporarily login on
another terminal.
