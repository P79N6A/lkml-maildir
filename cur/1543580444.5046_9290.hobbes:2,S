   Can we sort this out once and for all? There are a few emails
   everyday relating to this bug.
   The following patch posted by "Troels Walsted Hansen" <troels@thule.no>
   on Jan 11th fixes this. The problem is that when 2 consequtive
   NULLs are sent to klogd it goes into a busy loop. Andrew Mortons
   3c59x driver does this, but also on Jan 11th he replied that he had
   fixed it. I'm using 2.4ac4 with no problems, so I presume some
   of these patches have been lost along the way?
Yes, that did it.  It also explains why my desktop works fine, since
it uses an eepro100 network card.
