I personally see a difference and an advantage in making it easier to
read therefore easier to manage and maintain.
Sure it's a whole conversion process and may be a bit shocking to
existing drivers and people used to the struct in this format, but
that's nothing new to the kernel to yank something we're all so used to
and replace it with something that we would all benefit from in the long
term.
