Ok, I finally found a wee bit of clue.  I understand the assumption,
and in virgin 2.5.4, that assumption is enforced... somefsckingwhere ;-)
However, the locking changes do affect it in some magical way, and do
cause (well, trigger anyway) the breakage.
In 2.5.4, I creats a directory with 170 (two more than will fit in one call)
entries, and rm -r it.  Over all three dcache_readdir() calls, (one for the
first 168 entries (+.+..), one for the last two entries + seek, and one to
determine that we're empty), the dentry count remains stable at 170.  If I
apply the locking changes, POOF, my dentries disappear exactly as they do in
kernels >= 2.5.5-pre1.
64 Kibble-$$ question:
Why are my dentries going awol with the locking changes applied?
2.5.4.virgin
enter pos=0 count=170
seek pos=0 count=170
exit pos=170 count=170
enter pos=170 count=170
seek pos=0 count=170
exit pos=172 count=170
enter pos=172 count=170
exit EOF
2.5.4.locking
enter pos=0 count=170
seek pos=0 count=170
exit pos=170 count=170
enter pos=170 count=2
exit EOF
