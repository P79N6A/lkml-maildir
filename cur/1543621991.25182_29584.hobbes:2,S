Thanks Alan and Jeff for the input, i'll cleanup this stuff. Out of 
interest, do we normally take in patches for specialised embedded boxes? I 
see the AMD Elan stuff got in but that only touched one area and was easy 
to integrate. I presume they'd get accepted if the code was broken up into 
seperate modules instead of being overly specialised. For example, the 
CRIS stuff in the Etrax tree (developer.axis.com).
