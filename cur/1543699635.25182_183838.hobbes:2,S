Hi,
it does work, and you even can have multiple 
virtual consoles, and even on a single dual headed
Matrox G4xx/G550 although there are still some 
small/big :-)  issues 
may i ask what do you mean by that :
----
 Even though the HOWTO is more for Backstreet Ruby, 
 I couldn't make head or tail of it.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
----
asking cause i wrote the howto,
and i hardly get feedback
the one thing i know is, that it's simply too big ,
but i tried to cover everything and there is no other way :(
best,
svetljo
