Doesn't sounds like a problem. Merely have to set up LPR or whatever printing 
subsystem is in use w/ your distribution. You never said what distribution, 
so I can't tell you what to do to configure your box. Presumably, all u need 
to do is configure whatever LPR equivalent to use /dev/usblp0 (or do a find 
for lp0 in your /dev/ directory).

It's kind of hard when you don't tell us enough to give you a concise answer. 
Please help us by helping yourself in the future.

BTW, next time try to cc: to the appropriate subsystem maintainer (in this 
case USB and/or printing/parport) not the kernel maintainer. Neither Linus or 
Marcelo need to be cc:'d for this kind of question.
