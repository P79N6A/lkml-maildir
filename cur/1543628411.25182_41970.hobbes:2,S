I was not sure where the race was - I really did not see a preempt-only
race there, but I could not pinpoint the cause for an SMP race.  Since
it was only showing itself as a preempt-related race, I disabled
preemption.
Erich Focht later pointed out that interrupts should be disabled in
migration_init and we sent a patch off to Linus.  I will do some testing
and see if this fixes it (I suspect it may) and subsequently remove the
preempt code.
