You know, we might be barking down the wrong tree.  (Arf.)
So far, everybody who has reported video corruption seems to have
a Savage or ProSavage video card.  Maybe it'd be a better idea to
look at the ProSavage data sheets and see if we should be
tweaking something there?  That would be much safer than playing
around with the northbridges.
