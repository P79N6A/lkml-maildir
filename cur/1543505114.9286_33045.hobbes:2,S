i have here 4 * 25GB ibm disks
and an asus p2b-d board with 2* p2-450
now i read i should only use master devices
so i should buy an extra ide controller
i can buy the promise ide/66 and Abit HotRod66(HPT366 chipset)
i looked in the 2.2.10 kernel, but saw no support for them
in the 2.3.12 there is support for the promise 
and in 2.3.13pre?? is support for the hpt366 chipset (abit hotrod66)
only how do i get raid working with 2.3.x ?
cause the 2.2.10 raid patch gives already errors when i try to patch the
stock 2.2.10 kernel.
Please give me advise, so i can get raid working really soon.
(I thought about buying 2 extra controllers so i could get the 4 disks all
on full speed)
now i have the 4 disks on the onboard controller and get real slow speed :
(hdparm -t on /dev/md0 gives 4.3mb/sec :( )
