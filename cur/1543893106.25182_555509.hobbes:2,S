Hi!
I tried to use `subj`, but hit few problems:
There's no maintainers entry. Should
 James P. Ketrenos <ipw2100-admin@linux.intel.com> 
be listed as a maintainer?
Kconfig mentions...
          See <file:Documentation/networking/README.iwlwifi> for
          information on the capabilities currently enabled in this
          driver and for tips for debugging issues and problems.
...but that file does not exist.
