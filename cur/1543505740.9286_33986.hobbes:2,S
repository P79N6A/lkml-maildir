Huh?  Explain please.  When Linus and myself updated the various SCSI drivers
we took this into account.  Most of the drivers never did a damn thing in the
reset routines, so those were easy:
  return(SCSI_RESET_SNOOZE);
But in the other cases, we tried to make sure things were done right.  What
exactly are you referring to?
