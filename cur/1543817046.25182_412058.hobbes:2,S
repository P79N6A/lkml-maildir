The client is responsible for using any channels it gets, or falling
back to memcpy() if it doesn't get any. (I don't understand how PIO
comes into the picture..?)

Correct, if there aren't any CPU concurrency issues then 1 channel
will use the device's full bandwidth (unless some other client has
acquired the other channels and is using them, of course.)

It does the simplest thing that could possibly work right now:
channels are allocated first come first serve. When there is a need,
it should be straightforward to allow multiple clients to share DMA
channels.
