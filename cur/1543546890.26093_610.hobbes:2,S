That must have been a particularly bad idea, the proposals were usually 
in the range of a few ifs and 2-3 additional cache line references in
signal delivery. 
[BTW, just by teaching all x86 glibcs to use sa_restorer properly you'll save
many more cycles than even a bad posix signal emulation could eat up --
