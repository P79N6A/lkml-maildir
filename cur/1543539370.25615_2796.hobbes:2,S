Hi!
I'm having two problems with 2.4.0-test5-pre3 on a Miata.
1) serial console doesn't work
2) kernel can't mount root - I see (copied by hand -- see above;)
     Partition check:
      sda: unknown partition table
The system has an ATAPI cdrom and a SCSI disk/Qlogic controller.
I'm using aboot-0.5 and a BSD partition table -- 2.2.16 with a similar
configuration boots fine, serial console works.  Boot flags are:
   root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0,38400 console=tty0
.config and 2.2.16 boot log follows - let me know if more information
is needed.
