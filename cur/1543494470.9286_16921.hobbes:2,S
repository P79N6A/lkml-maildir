I get:
2 root@red:/# hdparm -tT /dev/hd[ab]
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  1.69 seconds =37.87 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in  3.29 seconds = 9.73 MB/sec
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  1.67 seconds =38.32 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in  5.01 seconds = 6.39 MB/sec

My hdparm results seem very indicative of actual transfer rates
for IDE disks.

If you copy as described above, are you rebooting inbetween
tests, or otherwise somehow emptying any cached data?  Just a
thought...
