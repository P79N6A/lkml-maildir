Hello,
Thank you for your responses. In answer to your question
Dmitri, I got the kernel from updates.redhat.com and
verified the GPG signature. This bug was actually
submitted to Red Hat's bugzilla on October 26 (# 76797).
I've added my experience to that report.
Thanks again to Dmitri, Alan and Rik. Just seeing these
names made me giddy :)
Cheers,
