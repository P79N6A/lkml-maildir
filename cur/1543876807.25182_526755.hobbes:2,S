In my case, the problem of freezer failing was due to the vfork freezer race
in do_fork. The parent task was waiting_for_completion() while the child was
frozen.
Rafael has already sent out the fix for that, but for some reason I
don't see it in the -mm.
With that fix, freezer and hence hotplug succeeds even when I am running
a 'make -j' test.
