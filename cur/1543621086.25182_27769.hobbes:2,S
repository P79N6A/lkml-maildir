Some confusion is going on.
So do you have log replay or you do not have log replay?

Ok. That's definitely bad. You said you see corruptions on two boxes, right?
Is it as simple as boot into 2.5.4, reiserfsck (and see no errors),
mount an fs, do something, type "reboot" and  reboot into 2.5.4 again,
and viola - here are zeroed files. Right?

There was flaky hardware on the other report. And I think Alex Riesen
cannot reproduce zero files anymore.
