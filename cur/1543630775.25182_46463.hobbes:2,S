If you're talking about kbuild2.5 where all the __FILENAME__s
become absolute (for good reason) instead of the leafnames they
usually were (header files excepted): not many instances, but
that's not the point.  The point is that all the instances of
__FILENAME__ within one compilation unit (across compilation
units? rumours that that will become so) get combined into a
single string, so little overhead to many BUG()s in one file.
But you are now creating lots of __FUNCTION__ strings which
cannot be combined to the nearly same extent (though, yeah,
all those "__free_pages_ok"s will get combined into one).
Your BUG() may have made space savings relative to kbuild2.5,
I don't know, but that's because kbuild2.5 has inadvertently
added a bloat there, and I thought we were looking for ways
to recover from that (I'd earlier proposed KBUILD_BASENAME,
but didn't understand stringification), to get back to
Andrew's lean mean clean implementation (before which we
needed CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n to cut out the overhead).
