Cool!
I've had a tiny bit of success (swptst _passed_ once, and currently
locks with 1 inactive_clean page instead of always 0;) by fiddling
with __alloc_pages() a bit.
One thing that I _think_ may be a problem is using stale information.
direct_reclaim is set once, it's set without checking that a reclaim
is possible, and it's not updated as we proceed although the situation
may change.
Another thing I'm curious about is increasing memory pressure in the
event of an allocation failure (retry).  Why do we do that?
Comments?

P.S.  in buffer.c, we do a LockPage(), but no UnlockPage() in the
case of no_buffer_head.. is that correct?
