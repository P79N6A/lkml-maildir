I have a LS-120 IDE floppy drive on /dev/hdg and have recently been trying
to create a bootdisk using it, but so far the nearest I've got is "invalid
compressed format" (using dd to copy the kernel image to the disk and
configuring with rdev) or "LI" (using lilo).
My current lilo.conf is:
boot = /dev/hdg
install = /floppy/boot.b
map = /floppy/map
root = /dev/hdg
append = "mem=128M"
image = /floppy/linux
label = Floppy
What am I doing wrong?
