you are right - this one place would have to be aware of CPUs going away.

good!

you can introduce a variable RT signal for this purpose no problem - and
one would want to have a queued signal for this anyway. Ie. by default the
notification is disabled, but a new syscall sets up the process to be
notified of CPU up/down events, on a signal # picked by the app. But this
this indeed is dbus domain ...
