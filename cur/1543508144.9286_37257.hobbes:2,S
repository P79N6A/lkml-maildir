Try different IO ranges when insmod:ing the driver. The ISA drivers do
autoprobing for the card's configuration when built into the kernel, but
not when modules (so they don't step on each other's toes). The driver
module should be able to find the IRQ by itself, but it can't probe for IO
ranges. The driver source will probably tell you what IO ranges it probes,
or you could look at the messages when booting your kitchen sink.
Hope this helps a bit.
