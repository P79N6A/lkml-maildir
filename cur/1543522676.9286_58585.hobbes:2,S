Yes, we (the linux-atm folks) of course know that.  The pointer is
treated as an opaque descriptor in user space, just like a file
descriptor is passed back from open().  We just need a type
that is garaunteed to hold a kernel-mode pointer given weird cases
like sparc64 (suppose mips64 and hppa64 will be similar when support
for them arrives)
Personally, I'm advocating __u64.  Note that no long-long calculations
need to be done on 32-bit archs - the kernel will cast it down to
"unsigned long" first thing - so all those unpleasantries don't
come into play.
