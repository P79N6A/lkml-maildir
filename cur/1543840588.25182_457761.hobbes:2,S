There's nothing special about our hardware that requires this.  We just
wanted that in there so we could direct customers to look at dmesg to
see if the warning popped up if they call with a problem.  It is useful
to have for this purpose.

I'd be OK with doing that, too.

It's useful when you're trying to track down problems.

OK - I'll fix this up.  Thanks for spotting it.
