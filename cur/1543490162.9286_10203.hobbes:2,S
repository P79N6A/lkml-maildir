I take that back.  kill -9 -1 seems to kill all processes associated with
the user that runs it. If I run it from a telnet session, it seems I get
logged out (Connection closed by foreign host). I am not sure if the shell
process is being killed causing me to be logged off or if the telnet
session is dying.
$ /bin/kill -9 -1 3184
Connection closed by foreign host.
