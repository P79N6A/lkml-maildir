Let me get this straight... "edd=skipmbr" boots fine, but commenting out
the call to query_edd() didn't?  Could you please try that (and, I
guess, only that), and make sure everything necessary is rebuild.
2.6.23-*rc2* you say boots fine with "edd=skipmbr", but not without?
Did you try the above commenting-out on rc2?
Just don't want to be chasing ghosts.
