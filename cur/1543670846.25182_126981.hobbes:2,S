Adding video=matroxfb did the trick.  Thanks for the tip.
I still don't understand the logic of it, though.
If the kernel can find the resources to present the logo,
why can't it just keep using those resources for the rest
of the boot?
char *foo = find_a_home_for_tux();
if(foo) {
	logo_logo_logo(foo);
	keep_on_booting_baby(foo);
}
else {
	boot_or_die_trying("blinkenlights_n_beeperen");
}
what's next, rootname=/?
