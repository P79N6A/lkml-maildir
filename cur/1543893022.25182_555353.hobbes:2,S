Subject: [PATCH 3/3] cpuset: zero malloc - fix for new containers

Third of three -- This applies after the container patches,
fixing a problem that earlier patches also fixed in the older
cpuset code.
The container code to present a list of tasks using a container
to user space could write to an array that it had kmalloc'd,
after a kmalloc request of zero size.
The problem was that the code didn't check for writes past the
allocated end of the array until -after- the first write.
This is a race condition that is likely rare -- it would only show
up if a container went from being empty to having a task in it,
during the brief time between the allocation and the first write.
Prior to roughly 2.6.22 kernels, this was also a benign problem,
because a zero kmalloc returned a few usable bytes anyway,
and no harm was done with the bogus write.
With the 2.6.22 kernel changes to make issue a warning if
code tries to write to the location returned from a zero size
allocation, this problem is no longer benign.  This container code
would occassionally trigger that warning.
The fix is trivial -- check before storing into the array,
not after, whether the array is big enough to hold the store.

Andrew - this is the third of three similar patches.  This one
redoes the fix for the container code.
