But they increase pressure on the resource and reduce availability to
other higher order allocations. They accelerate the breakdown of the
anti-frag heuristics, and they make slab internal fragmentation worse.
They also simply cost more to allocate and free and reclaim.

They are also a disadvantage. The disadvantages are very real. The
advantage is a bit theoretical (how much really is it going to help
going from 4K to 32K, if you still have hundreds or thousands of
slabs anyway?). Also, there is no reason why the other allocators
cannot use higher orer allocations, but their big advantage is that
they don't need to.

I'd like to see any real numbers showing this is a problem. Queue
trimming in SLQB can easily be scaled or tweaked to change latency
characteristics. The fact is that it isn't a very critical or highly
tuned operation. It happens _very_ infrequently in the large scheme
of things, and could easily be changed if there is a problem.
What you have in SLUB IMO is not obviously better because it effectively
has sizeable queues in higher order partial and free pages and the
active page, which simply never get trimmed, AFAIKS. This can be harmful
for slab internal fragmentation as well in some situations.
