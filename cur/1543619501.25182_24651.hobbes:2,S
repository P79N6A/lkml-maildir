Well, provided the 'backmerge' respects tag, or certain kinds of tags
(ie the tree is 'soft tagged' as v2.5.4-pre3, v2.5.4-pre2, v2.5.4-pre1
and 'hard tagged' as v2.5.3.  'backmerge' will attempt to move a change
back only as far as v2.5.3, since v2.5.3 had an API change here.
Or the other option, since this isn't the _default_ behavior, but an
optional one is to give backmerge a 'don't go past tag' since the
developer should be aware that the API changed at v2.5.3 or v2.5.4-pre2
and even tho the change might apply cleanly further back, since it's
updating the driver to the new API, don't try anyways.)
