Linus,
sched.c got bigger and bigger over the years. The attached patch splits
sched.c into scheduling related code (sched.c) and timer/timekeeping code
(ktimer.c).
there was another reason for me to do this splitup: add_timer(),
del_timer(), getpid(), timer interrupt and other important kernel
functions were penalized on x86 by sched.c's -fno-omit-frame-pointer flag.
[we need %ebp to get correct WCHAN in sched.c unfortunately.]
The lack of %ebp as a general purpose register has direct performance
impact. I've put sys_getpid() and the other simple (non-scheduling
related) system calls into ktimer.c. getpid() alone won 4 cycles, which is
a 3% speedup with fast system calls :-)
	(SYSENTER  based getpid(), got pid 2918) latency:138 cycles
(down the 138 cycles from 142 cycles)
Cache footprint got slightly smaller as well. Patch is against
pre2-2.3.32, the resulting kernel compiles/boots/works just fine in both
SMP and UP mode.
