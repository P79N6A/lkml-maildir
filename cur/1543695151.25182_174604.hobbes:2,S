Oh, I have an example for you.
Consider the Intel Plumas chipset. There are
some predictable time windows during which the
RTC will return garbage. The BIOS "fix" leads to
SMI/SMM stuff stealing large chunks of CPU time.
On a logic analyser, somebody at work observed
chunks of time as large as 4 ms. That's 3 to 5
clock ticks. Maybe that isn't worst-case even.
To avoid this disaster, Linux must _never_ touch
the RTC registers. The HPET can be used instead.
The TSC is of course also reliable, but Linux
stops using it as soon as a problem hits!
The ignore-the-TSC code really should be doing
just the opposite. Ticks are likely to be lost.
I've never seen an unstable TSC. :-)

Hey, 32-bit dev_t is in already. That's it. Done.
