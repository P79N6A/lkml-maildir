Actually, it's label name, not "mount point".  Some
people/distributions will use a label name of "/" for the root
filesystem, but that is purely a convention.

It's not an association of device name and file system label.  It is
an assignment of a filesystme label to a *filesystem*.  The label is
actually stored in the ext3's superblock.

You can do this, and on some distributions it does work that way; the
initial root device is actually an initrd, and the initrd will search
the drivers looking for the root drive.  The blkid library, or the
blkid program, can be used provide that functionality (indeed the
mount program, when passed the argument "LABEL=/" can be compiled to
use the blkid library to do this searching).
So it does (or at least can) work this way already, but it's all
userspace stuff which is currently distro-specific.  Which brings up
the question why you posted this on LKML....
