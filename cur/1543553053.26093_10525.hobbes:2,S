Quiet suggestion:
Maybe better is to get rid of the X version variables?  Append -EXPORTS
to everything that exports, and generate the genksyms food from:
	$(patsubst %.o-EXPORTS,%.c, $(filter %-EXPORTS, $(OBJS))
And the link line from:
	$(patsubst %-EXPORTS, %, $(OBJS))
This allows complete control over the link order.
Rusty.
