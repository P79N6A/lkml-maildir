i expect it to be pretty much like voluntary-preempt: there was much 
flaming 9 months ago and by today 99% of the voluntary-preempt patches 
are already in the upstream kernel and the remaining 1% (which just adds 
the config option and touches one include file) i didnt submit yet.
so i dont think there's much need to worry or even to decide anything 
upfront: the merge is already happening. The two biggest preconditions 
of PREEMPT_RT, the irq subsystem rewrite, and the spinlock-init API 
cleanups are already upstream. The rest is just details or out-of-line 
code. The discussions need to happen in small isolated steps, as the 
component technologies are merged and discussed. The components are all 
useful even without the final PREEMPT_RT step (which further proves the 
usefulness of PREEMPT_RT - but you dont have to agree with that global 
assertion).
So i'm afraid nothing radical will happen anywhere. Maybe we can have 
one final flamewar-party in the end when the .config options are about 
to be added, just for nostalgia, ok? =B-)
