no such change is needed to native. [ other than the removal of tons of 
lowlevel hooks ;-) ] Think of this in terms of a completely separate MM 
layer for guest kernels, with all memory management details done on the 
hypervisor side, ok? I dont think you can emulate that in an equivalent 
way via VMI, the kernel object in this model is on the hypervisor side - 
while with VMI that does not look possible.
