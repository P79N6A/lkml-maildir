...and here is where you sliped the track. Linux is designed by those
who post patches and lobby for thier use. If something doesn't work for
you post *patches* that fix it. Complaints that you don't have time to
work around current code gets you nothing. 
As far as I can see, the reason that staticis now live in 
/proc/partitions is that there was code _submitted_ (the sar patches) 
to collect the staticis. If you have a better patch I, for one, would 
love to see it. I don't think IO statistics shareing /proc/partitons 
is great *design* but it was thought it would break the least tools 
out there.

Everyone loves the debate, but if no code is ever show all we get out of
it _is_ the debate. How many times has this happened on this subject
(widely taken as the /proc/* debate)? I've seen lots of hot air, but
little code.
Just my take,
