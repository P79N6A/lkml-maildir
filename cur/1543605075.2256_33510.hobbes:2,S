Depends on the drivers/devices you are using.  Currently the uhci.o
driver doesn't work properly for some devices that use bulk queuing
(visor, empeg, bluetooth, etc.) while the usb-uhci driver does.
On the other hand, the usb-uhci driver doesn't work for some people with
other kinds of hardware.
Try both out, and see which one works for you :)
(hopefully this problem goes away soon...)
thanks,
