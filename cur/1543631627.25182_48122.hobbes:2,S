Current ATA code says about this:
/*
  * Returns the queue which corresponds to a given device.
  *
  * FIXME: this should take struct block_device * as argument in future.
  */
static request_queue_t *ata_get_queue(kdev_t dev)
{
	struct ata_channel *ch = (struct ata_channel *)blk_dev[major(dev)].data;
	/* FIXME: ALLERT: This discriminates between master and slave! */
	return &ch->drives[DEVICE_NR(dev) & 1].queue;
}
Guess who did spill the FIXME: entiers there?
So of course plese plese go ahead as soon as possible!.
I would love to don't have to look at the above any longer.
