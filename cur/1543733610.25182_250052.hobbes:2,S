Step 1, the tools are very broken. This level of nonfunctionality
of the reiser4 toolchain precludes any kind of exposure to the kind of
testing I've asked about. I would very strongly prefer not to have to
become a reiser4 implementor and furthermore fix numerous bugs just to
have the smallest bit of assurance that this thing won't generate bug
reports en masse once merged.
The following is from an UltraSPARC system (64-bit wordsize, big-endian,
8KB pagesize, 32-bit userspace, including 32-bit compiled reiser4 tools)
running 2.6.9-rc1-mm3:

With the below patch, I get:

#
The S_ISBLK() check is so that other assumptions about the file being
a block device elsewhere won't be tripped up; it's not strictly
necessary, only retained so as not to expose unaudited code to a new
situation for which it's not prepared.
strace(1) before and after the patch is included here. The backtrace
