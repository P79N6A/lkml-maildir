Actually, in our case, the first dword was 0x80867111 (little-endian),
so when we read the first dword, we got 0x80867111 (big-endian),
since we were reading a dword, not individual bytes. If we read the
individual bytes, we do get the right bytes, but the PCI subsystem
returns the same bytes to us for either a little-endian or big-endian
dword read, since it doesn't know if the processor is big-endian
or little-endian  (The PowerPC can be both, or different processors
on the same bus can be different at the same time).

Well, when you have new hardware, a new compiler (with known bugs),
and a new processor chip, the fact that it works for others doesn't mean
that it's right.  It hardly seems wise to assume there are no problems
left
in the software.  My original question was "How can this work (since it
clearly must be working) when it does not appear to be correct?"
It's not as if the code is clearly documented that it depends upon the
PCI hardware knowing if it should return big-endian or little-endian
data.
