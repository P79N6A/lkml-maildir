Agreed. When I put this together first, I felt I would be able to isolate
pages of different types on migratelist but that is not the case as migration
would not be able to tell the difference between a LRU page and a pagetable
page. I'll rename cc->migratelist to cc->migratelist_lru with the view to
potentially adding cc->migratelist_pagetable or cc->migratelist_slab later.
