With Ingo's scheduler and with large boxes running tuned simulations set to
run over the right number of processors it is a win. With FXSAVE we dump
512 odd bytes of data out so its an even bigger win. With the K7 we want
to use MMX aggressively so having FPU saving that can save once when the
kernel first uses MMX/3Dnow is going to help too
