A reschedule can happen once every ms, but also upon returning to 
userspace and when returning from an interrupt handler, and also when 
something in the kernel explicitly calls schedule() or sleeps (which in 
turn results in a call to schedule()). And each CPU runs schedule() 
independently.
At least that's my understanding of it - if I'm wrong I hope someone on 
the list will correct me.
