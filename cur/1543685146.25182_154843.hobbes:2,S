> Giant patch? :( Can you split it?
Of course.
A moment ago I split off the third part. More will follow.
(1 was bookkeeping in sector_t, 2 was addr++ fix).
This third part takes code that was repeated three times,
namely a debugging printout of the IDENTIFY DEVICE result,
and leaves only a single copy, that moreover is a bit more correct.
One of the things that were wrong in the debugging part
is also wrong in the non-debugging part, namely the ordering
of the bitfields on a bigendian architecture.
Probably that will be the next installment.
Let me send this in four subparts.
Three parts that remove the debugging code, and one part
that adds a single copy, in a new file ide-identify.h
that contains stuff that will also correct and simplify
other code.
