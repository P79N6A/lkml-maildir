I saw the config option for netfilter that said if you use this it won't use
ipchains, so I said no to that...
The section of my .config file from make config (yeah I'm a glutton for
punishment):
# Networking options

CONFIG_PACKET=y
# CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP is not set
# CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV is not set
# CONFIG_NETFILTER is not set

"Incompatible with this kernel" for ipchains seems so that you have compiled
Netfilter stuff into your kernel.
"itself or the kernel needs upgrading" for iptables seems so that you either
haven't compiled netfilter as module(s) or static into the kernel and forgot
something in the kernel config.

Check your kernel config. "make menuconfig" or "xconfig" and goto:
Networking options  --->
  IP: Netfilter Configuration  --->
and look if you did it properly.
