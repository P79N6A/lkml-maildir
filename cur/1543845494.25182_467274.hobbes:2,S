Hi Karim,
Thank you for new idea.
I discussed your proposal deeply with my coworkers.
I think your approach has following advantages/disadvantages/problem;
<advantages>
(a) Able to be inserted into the target address of the branch.
(b) So, binary analysis tool becomes simple.
<disadvantages>
(c) Implementation is much complicated.
(d) Highly depend on the x86 arch.
(e) Bigger overhead than djprobe.
(f) There will be side effect(*)
<problem>
(g) User applications can modify LDT. (ex. wine)
I think the dcprobe will work, but, unfortunately, it has
an vulnerability by the problem (g).
(*) In the following code:
---
a=0
do {
...
a++;
}while (a <= 100)
---
In case of inserting dcprobe at the 1st line (a=0),
it will replace 2nd (or more) instructions.
In this case, the fix up routine (based on int3)
will be invoked one hundred times.
Thanks,
