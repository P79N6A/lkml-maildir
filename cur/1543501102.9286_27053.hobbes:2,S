Hi-
 We're running several 2.2.x systems based on RH 6.0 and have seen some
strangeness in the kernel-space NFS server.
 For example, If I update a file on the NFS server (from a VCON on the
server machine), clients don't see the changes until they reboot and/or
re-attach.  I've seen this from 2.2.5 through 2.2.9 on at least 5
machines.  The clients are a mixed bunch of Linux, Solaris, and VxWorks
systems, and all see basically the same problems with 2.2.x Linux NFS
servers.
 Am I missing some updated support libs or programs that address this.
 Thanks for any ideas-
ron
