No, it will never get fixed. I use two editors on a day-to-day basis,
and that is mcedit and joe. No fixed rule on which to use. It goes as
far that I have the same syntax highlighting (almost) on both.
Because one thing in one editor is cumbersome in the other.
Perhaps if there was one editor with the hotkeys of *both* (yes,
means duplicates), maybe then I'd be satisfied.

Actually, blue is perceived as one of the darkest colors by the human
eye. There is a reason that the RGB -> grayscale transformation uses
the following weighting: r=76 g=154 b=26.
