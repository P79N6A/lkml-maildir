I think a couple of months ago I was discussing on this mail list the same
problem with ac. From then I saw this message with every kernel on any VIA
based MB i tryed (for athlon, for K6 and so on). It is harmless, but
noisy. of course, disabling IOAPIC the problem does always disappear, but
it's again noisy.
