That's not what should be happening there: if the kernel only uses
__u32 and friends but never uint32_t et al. at an interface,
typedef __u32 uint32_t;
should be a perfectly safe thing for glibc's stdint.h to do.

Yes.

Yes, but that's decided by whether you include stdint.h or
anything that has the effect of including stdint.h. What I'm
saying is that there should be a guarantee that __u32 and
uint32_t are always identical types. If they are merely
assignment-compatible, you run into problems like this
/* somewhere in a kernel-to-glibc interface (on 32 bit) */
typedef unsigned int __u32;
...
static __u32 foo;
/* elsewhere, in glibc (on 32 bit) */
typedef unsigned long uint32_t;
...
static uint32_t bar;
/* finally, in the application */
if (&foo == &bar)
	/* do something */;

Interfaces are normally specified with the explicit data type of
each item, in particular struct members. The masses will probably
look for solid branches instead of olive twigs for you if you try
to break this kind of assurance :-)
