You can also say that it cannot know that data written to /dev/random
is truly random unless it is also validated ?
For argument you could just run "cat < /dev/hwrandom > /dev/random"
instead of using rngd.
If /dev/random demands a level of randomness,  shouldn't it enforce it ?
If the HW is using 2 random sources, a non-linear mixer and a FIPS140
post processor before handing you a random number it would be nice to
take advantage of that IMO.
Cheers,
