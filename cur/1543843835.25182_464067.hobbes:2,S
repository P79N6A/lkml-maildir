That suggestion is so funny to me that i'll let it stand here in its 
absurdity :) Did i get it right, you are suggesting for LTT to build a 
full SystemTap interpreter, an script-to-C compiler, an embedded-C 
script interpreter, just to be able to build-time generate the SystemTap 
scripts back into the source code? Dont you realize that you've just 
invented SystemTap, sans the ability to remove inactive code? ;)
I know a much easier method: a "static tracer" can do all of that (and 
more), if you rename "SystemTap" to "static tracer" ;-)
