Which shell are you using? Also, what is your prompt set to?
I get exactly that occurring with bash if my prompt includes certain
variable length fields, but if I use a static prompt such as " Q> ",
it goes away...
 > This has happened since 2.2.0 if I remember right.
I had the above happenning back with RedHat 4.1 and kernel 2.0.29,
which is as early as I go, but ONLY with the bash shell - it appears
not to be a problem with tcsh which is the other shell I've used...
Best wishes from Riley.
