Something like that. The TIF flag is to pick off processes that we are 
interested in auditing, for performance reasons if audit is disabled the 
context is not created. But if auditing is re-enabled, processes can 
be "repaired" so that the are auditable again by allocating the context on 
the fly the first time we see a process. Without the flag, they never get 
steered into the audit system where this can happen.

If any other performance improvements jumps out at you, please bring them up.

Yep
