I heard this too --- I just don't understand why did they route it to an 
interrupt and undertook the complicated sequence of aborting the commands 
by the kernel --- instead of simply routing it to PCI reset line --- that 
would reset the controller and stop it from feeding data to disks.
Also, if they had ECC memory, the chipset should detect unrecoverable 
garbage and respond with target-abort or full system reset and not feed 
bad data to the controller.

ATX has PWR_OK pin that should be deasserted on power failure before the 
voltage drops.
I don't know if motherboards use it --- but there should be no problem 
routing the pin to the chipset reset and stop it before power goes low.

You can read the block number back from ATA disk after you write it and 
before you submit the command.
