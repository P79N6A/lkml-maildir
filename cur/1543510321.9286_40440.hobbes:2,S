The current model is the only thing that works for the developers, yes
it may be inconvenient for the users to download the large tarball
with support for 10 different architectures to compile a kernel for
the x86. However the kernel source is to be managable for the
_developers_.

The other issue, quoting Alan, is that a lot of drivers contain the
same bugs, if you nail a bug in one driver you are likely to be able
to fix it in 5 other drivers. If they are all seperated someone will
discover the same bug 12 months later/.

Shell scripting fortunately solves most of that problem, and if I make
an API change to something, I consider it my responsibility to at
least try and propagate it to a large part of code in the tree. I
cannot be bothered to run around searching for obscure drivers on the
Web though.
