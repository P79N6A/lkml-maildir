Yup, that is my point.

In the above I was talking about dirty.
For accessed, we currently do not use the HW bit neither. Accessed = in
the hash, not accessed = not in the hash. A bit basic, but the cost of
faulting them back in isn't that bad. Still, I always found it a bit
stupid that we end up having the harvesting of accessed bits actually
evict pages that _are_ accessed, and thus potentially here to be
accessed again ;)
Paul did some experiments using the HW bits and didn't see a great
perf increase (or what is even a decrease ?), but I should try that
again on ppc64 since there, we can much more quickly hit the proper
hash slot (we store its index in one group within the PTE).
Another problem with using real A & D hash bits is that we may evict
entries from the hash table (because both groups are full for a given
hash value). In this case, we need to go back to the linux PTE to
update the bits in there before we lose the A/D information from the
hash. But I don't think the overhead here matters much, we only rarely
do evicts.
