  "dummy" is a technical term, applying to the curn method and your
answer;-) Don't you hate it when you read past information like that?

DAO should work for any device which supports it. That's not double-speak,
cdrecord returns the capabilities of the drive, and I believe it correctly
rejects asking for something the hardware can't do.
Read the docs carefully, I believe you can use RAW96 or similar modes on
older burners. I doubt that's the problem, though, I suspect burner
hardware.
The cd burning list is cdwrite@other.debian.org, send "subscribe cdwrite"
to majordomo there and ask the list if you don't get all you need there.
