This one will come back sometime. Hopefully... It is removed
for now, as code does not work (and never did). But help
text looks reasonable.

You can remove these two. They are now mandatory for some time,
and mandatory options do not need help ;-) BTW, for 2.5 I'm planning
to remove all CONFIG_NCPFS_* options, as you can modify behavior
at mount time instead of compile time.
