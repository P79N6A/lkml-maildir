I can see your point here. So as long as we can get the sections
within RODATA placed into the right segment then we can still do
what we need. That will be good enough for me in the m68knommu case.

Oddly enough (or perhaps not :-) this is virtually the method I
currently use in the m68knommu vmlinux.lds.S to allow it to link
for both flash+ram or ram-only operation - depending on a CONFIG_
option.
