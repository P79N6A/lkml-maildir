This was a found dead lock between memcg and cpuset.
another one was 
	an operation like rmdir() in somewhere.
		hierarchy_lock for memcg (acquired)
		hierarchy_lock for B (waiting)
	in subsys B.
		hierarchy_lock for B (aquired)
		have to do some memory reclaim -> hierarchy_lock for memcg (waiting)
I have no objections to hierarchy_lock itself but calling context to memcg is very
complicated and simple replace of these locks will be just a small help.
