I don't think it's so bad (ie: it could be _worse_)
There's some work going on to fix some "bloat problems" too, for example
the x.org people are working in a sort of xlib complement/replacement (i
don't know its real purpose) xcb which should help latency and code
size. Composite itself is a nice way of avoiding that apps redraw their
windows all the time. KDE "speed" is better is much better than a year 
ago, gnome 2.8 is also somewhat "faster" (compare nautilus in gnome 2.6
vs the one in 2.8). Openoffice 2.0 also will have some "performance
improvements" (see

and
