I've got a stupid question too.  How do you back up these
things ?
If your backup program reads them as a file and restores
them as a file, you might lose your directory-inside-the-file
magic.
If your backup program dives into the file despite stat()
saying it's a file and you restore your backup, how are the
"file is a file" semantics preserved ?
Obviously this is something that needs to be sorted out at
the VFS layer.  A filesystem specific backup and restore
program isn't desirable, if only because then there'd be
no way for Hans's users to switch to reiser5 in 2010 ;)
