Maybe this isn't obvious.  Because of this expectation, it is
absolutely not safe to pre-erase blocks, just because the fs will
write them anyway.  Unless you can guarantee that the write will
always succeed, even in case of power outage, you just broke the
expectation.
Fixing all filesystem is also not an option, even ignoring the
question whether such a change would be a fix, a change of behaviour
or a plain bug.
So the only remaining option is to add a new interface that lets
filesystems decide to support pre-erase in some form.  And one such
interface would be the "forget" operation.  Nice attribute of forget
is the fact that it would also help some FTL layers in the kernel.
There is nothing MMC-specific about it.
