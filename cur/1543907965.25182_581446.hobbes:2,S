I don't think <b> and <i> should be used, instead you should use styles
(<span class="code"> etc). Things like <em> and <strong> should be OK,
if used consistently.

If you like that, you can say "p {text-align:justify;}" in the default
stylesheet. (And if people would override the alignment, class="block"
would be the wrong name).
BTW: You should not listen to those "frames-are-evil" guys. This will only
force you to include all the navigation code in each page, and having to scroll
beyond a ton of navigation stuff was a major annoyance while trying to read
the selinux docs. Instead, you should e.g. provide an "up", "prev" and "next"
link on each page, and keep the rest in the navigation frame (if needed).

    Oh, so that's why ps doesn't work.
