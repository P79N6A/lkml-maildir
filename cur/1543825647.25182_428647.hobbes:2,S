Btw, that probably requires some clarification.
Since hash table size is definitely less than returned hash value, so
higher bits are removed, for that case above folding is done both in
XOR hash and my test case. 
It is possible to just remove higher bits, but fairly ditributed parts
being xored produce still fairly distributed value.
