Yes, I know. That's why the patch I sent to Linus didn't do that ;-)
But perhaps /dev/kmem, /dev/mem, /dev/port, /dev/random and
/dev/urandom could be moved, since only Linux-specific tools would
need to be modified.
It's really only /dev/full, /dev/null and /dev/zero that are "well
known".

In that case we could move it. First add it to devfs and eventually
remove it from /proc.
