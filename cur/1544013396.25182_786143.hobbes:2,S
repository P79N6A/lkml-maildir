kernel/workqueue.c: In function ‘wq_cpu_map’:
kernel/workqueue.c:94: warning: pointer type mismatch in conditional expression
That's a problem for a start.  Looks like a merge bug.  Does removing the &
from in front of cpu_populated_map help?
static const struct cpumask *wq_cpu_map(struct workqueue_struct *wq)
{
	return is_wq_single_threaded(wq)
		 ? get_cpu_mask(singlethread_cpu) : &cpu_populated_map;
}
Cheers,
Rusty.
