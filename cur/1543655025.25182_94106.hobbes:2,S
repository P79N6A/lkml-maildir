32-bit is not irrelevant, but there's certainly a 64-bit land where
the critical 32-bit correctness issue becomes a minor 64-bit
performance issue. This is the nature of extended 32-bit addressing.
By and large what is a severe and world-breaking correctness issue for
32-bit with extended addressing is a performance issue for the rest.
And so I feel we are all in harmony; the scheduler statistics are in
fact valuable on all platforms, it's just an question of basic "should
this overhead be required or optional?"
