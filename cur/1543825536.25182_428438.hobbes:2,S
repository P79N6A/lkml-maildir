Partly to add myself to the cc-list, partly to add some oil in the fire - 
there have been a few discussions on arm-kernel recently, one of them 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=114136178100001&r=1&w=2
where at least you can get some more test results / failure pictures. 
However, many have also stated that the patch set from Tejun, 
unfortunately, doesn't fix 100% of IDE PIO cache coherency problems on 
ARM.
Thanks for bringing this back up
