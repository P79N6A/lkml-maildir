 Did someone noticed that if a user want to test Linux-2.5,
 he downloads for the first time a 2.5 kernel, extract and type
make menuconfig
 and that takes its default (.config) from the only kernel
 available on his (really standard) distribution - a 2.4.* kernel.
 Then, there isn't any CONFIG_VT to choose for (I do not know
 why) - it is completely undefined and not present in the menus.
 If you type "make bzImage; cp bzImage /boot" you get a kernel
 which seems to crash at startup even for the simplest
 configuration you've choosen.
 The obvious solution is to do - when it is the first time you
 configure a 2.5.* kernel, the line:
cp arch/i386/defconfig .config
 but I am not sure this is intuitive enough...
  Etienne.
