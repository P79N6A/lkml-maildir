I had problems with dual Intel Pentium 120 ASUSTEK motherboard with kernel version 2.2.0 - 2.2.1 (machine fully died on reboot). This problems was fixed by Ingo's patch ([patch] SMP fixes #3, for pre-2.2.2-1), and later by 2.2.2-pre2.
But this morning machine fully locked up twice! Current kernel version is 2.2.2-pre2, built with egcs-1.1.1.
Can anybody point me to my "trouble-source"?
Mother ASUSTEK PCI/E-P54NP4, 2 Intel Pentium 120 procs, AHA-2940(PCI), 3c509(ISA), ZNYX(PCI), Trident(ISA).
This hardware configuration worked fine with 2.0.36 and earlier...
Thanks, Alex.
