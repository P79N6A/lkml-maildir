Oh, ok, that makes it even easier to say this with certainty:   
Changing the other 64-bit archs to use "long long" for their 64-bit  
numbers will not cause additional warnings.  I'm also almost certain  
there are no architectures which use "long long" for 128-bit  
integers. (Moreover, I can't find hardly anything which does 128-bit  
integers at all).
