Dear Friend,
I am Liu Yan, I am a Transfer Supervisor in Bank Of China. Hong Kong.
I have a proposal to discuss about a late Client of mine who I think is co-incidentally related to you, on fixed deposit in my bank.
Please contact me through email if you are interested to know.
Thank you.
Regards,
Liu Yan.
