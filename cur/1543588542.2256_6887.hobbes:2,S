As much as SCSI is too low down, so I still don't see why this should be a
SCSI issue. Assuming requests are no smaller than hw_blksize looks rather sane
for a low-level driver. It's still enforced in ll_rw_blk(). I'd rather blame
the callers when they bypass the check via submit_bh().
More to the topic, FAT in 2.2 contained lots of special code to deal with
bigblocks. In 2.4, this code got removed in favour of the generic
functions in fs/buffer.c, to the effect that operations that happen to not
deref a NULL pointer now request 2k blocks using 512 byte-calculated block
numbers. I see two options:
a) Put in lots of bigblock special case code in FAT;
b) teach submit_bh() or generic_make_request() to transparently reblock 
   bhs < hw_blksize and remove most special cases from FAT. Specifically,
   it ought to stop pretending in sb->s_blocksize to use 2k blocks when
   the fs is really tied to 512 byte blocks.
I tend to favour b), but which one is more likely to be accepted?
Regards,
Daniel.
