The irq _is_ enabled ona hardware level.
Which can be a total disaster if there are shared PCI irq's, and the
interrupt is "screaming" (ie an active level-sensitive thing).
We've had this on cardbus, for example, where we need to do an
"pci_emable_device()" in order to get access to the PCI IO mappings, which
are needed to shut the device up.
Right now the solution to a screaming device can be something as nasty as
	cli();
	pci_enable_device();
	disable_irq(dev->irq);
	sti();
	/* IRQ handling needs this ioremapped */
	membase = ioremap(dev->resource[]);
	request_irq(dev->irq);
	/* Now we can enable the irq, because we have a valid handler */
	enable_irq(dev->irq);
which is horribly stupid. We really want to do
	pci_enable_mem(dev);
	membase = ioremap(dev->resource[]);
	pci_request_irq(dev, irq_handler);
where "pci_request_irq()" enables the interrupt and adds an interrupt
handler atomically.

It's required to be valid, because if it isn't, then the platform is
broken. There are no cross-platform issues: complain to the platform
vendor and/or the linux code for that architecture.
