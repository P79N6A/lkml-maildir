Just in case you want to experiment, i have a working port of ar5k
that works on madwifi-old before the BSD - HEAD merge...
well i'm no good programmer (yet), i did what i could (i'm sure those
define macros are nasty for most people :P) and hope that helps...
you can git clone from the following link
rsync://rsync.ath-driver.org/gnumonks_users/mb/openhal.git
I'm working with the following madwifi revision...
svn checkout 
http://svn.madwifi.org/branches/madwifi-old
 -r 1142 madwifi
Don't forget to remove the ending ) in line 175 at
net80211/ieee80211_radiotap.h ;-)
Also you'll need to do some modifications to make it work with newer
kernel versions (MODULE_PARM stuff in if_ath.c)...

I haven't looked much the MadWiFi code since then, perhaps you can
help in making ar5k work with newer madwifi versions + improve it's
functionality to help both linux and OpenBSD.
(The name OpenHAL came from John Bicket's initial port)
Happy coding ;-)
