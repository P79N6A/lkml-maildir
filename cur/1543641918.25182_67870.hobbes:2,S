Quite a many of vger's recipients are doing return-path verification
testing for SMTP's MAIL FROM address.
I would not mind that, EXCEPT that those bloody stupid things don't
have any sane caches at all!    VGER is sending 300+ messages per
day to 3500+ recipients of linux-kernel list EVERY DAY, and every
outgoing message is now getting oodles of those probes!
Folks,  when you deploy that kind of testers, DO VERIFY THAT THEY
HAVE SANE CACHES!  A positive result shall be cached for at least
two hours, a negative result shall be cached for at least 30 minutes.
That would send a dozen back-probes towards vger from recipient
system, instead of present 300+ !
