Two things with 2.4.0-test9pre6...
1. My machine locked up and about 3 seconds later rebooted. I was in X
at the time so I didnt see if any oops got printed to the console and
nothing showed up in the log file. My question is what's the best thing
to do in a situation like that in order to track down the problem.
Previous test9-pre* have locked up but never rebooted by itself.
2. If nfs/nfsd are compiled as modules you get this when starting the
daemon
