No - they have pretty much all failed except M$, and that one is showing 
cracks.

Unix DEFINED the standard. Before that, there were many "standards", a minimum
of one for each vendor, and frequently, several for each vendor. IBM almost
had one for every product line, DEC had one for each major product line, and
three different major OSs (though related) for the PDP11 (RSX 11, IAS, RSTS)
and one minor (RT-11). Each had it's own runtime, compilers/assemblers,
utilities, and system calls.
The POSIX definitions were adaped from the AT&T "System V Interface
Definition" issued in 1984/1985, which standardized AT&T Unix from about 1982
through 1985 (the existing commands/utilities/libraries definitions were
included).
