Use ExplorerPS/2 in XFree to get access to all the buttons. The new
input drivers handle the MouseMan protocol right in the kernel, and
independently on the real mouse type (ImPS/2, ImExPS/2, GenPS/2,
Logitech PS2++ USB, Busmouse, whatever) export an ExplorerPS/2-like
virtual mouse to userspace. This is what most applications support
correctly, and is compatible with generic PS/2 and ImPS/2 protocols also.

I fixed this in about 2.5.36. Please #define ATKBD_DEBUG in
drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c, and send me the kernel output just
before the crash, please. I'll try to reproduce it here meanwhile.
