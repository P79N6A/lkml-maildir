2.6.23-rc5 dies here random[1] too .. on 2 Dell boxes ( i686 not x86_64 here ) which I upgraded to rc5 yesterday.
When dies 'Caps Lock and Scroll Lock' blinks and the box lockups hard .. rc4 got an 7 days uptime on both with the same config ,
kernel compiled with same gcc/glibc/binutils etc.
I don't have any Oops/BUG or whatever messages in any of my logs nor I'm able to capture everything with netconsole :/
Any idea how else I could capture the Oops/BUG messages ?
Ohh well all I have is this : ( captured with a script which I started some seconds before a box died , no idea it has something to
do with this bug but I post anyway )

I don't use any *binary* drivers.
[1] It dies after minutes or after hour(s) , dies while doing something ( like compiling , copying stuff ) or while
    doing nothing ( box idles no activity at all ).
Right now I got an 3h uptime ( heh ) while died before in about 2 hours 5 times..
