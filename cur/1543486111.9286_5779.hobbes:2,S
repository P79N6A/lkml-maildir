  How about "ptrdiff_t"?
  According to K&R[2e], pg 103:
  "The header <stddef.h> defines a type ptrdiff_t that is large enough
  to hold the signed difference of two pointer values."
  So, the unsigned version of whatever type ptrdiff_t is should be large
  enough to hold all possible pointer values, no?
