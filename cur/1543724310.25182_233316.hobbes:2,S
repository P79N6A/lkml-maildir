Don't use it on redhat systems, those bug reports tend to be for redhat 
kernels, redhat refuses to apply our bugfixes that we send in to the 
official kernel because they want us to look bad.  I sound so paranoid 
when I say that, but they really do refuse to apply our bugfixes.
ReiserFS V3 has been very stable for quite some time in 2.4.x.  There 
were some instabilities recently in some versions of 2.6.x due to code 
changes not by our team. sigh....
We at Namesys are much more conservative in code changes for V3 than 
ext*.  I can't control some of the changes by SuSE though that have 
added some bugs that could have been caught by more serious QA.  (SuSE 
adheres to the usual linux lack of QA approach, it is not that they are 
bad, but that they conform to the social norm for linux.)  Hopefully I 
will have more control over that in V4.
