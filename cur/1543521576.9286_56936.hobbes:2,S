description:
Fork Bomb Defuser is an easily loadable kernel module for Linux which
detects, logs, and disables "fork bombs". It allows you to configure
max_forks_per_second and max_tasks_per_user parameters at module load
time. Any possible fork bomb that attempts to spawn a huge number of
processes simultaneously is detected in real time, and the fork bomb is
disabled.
changes:
Support for defusing clone() and vfork() bombs, a major code clean-up
and optimizations, improved documentation and better-commented code,
and a website mirror at Geocities to solve download problems
encountered in Tripod.
urgency:
