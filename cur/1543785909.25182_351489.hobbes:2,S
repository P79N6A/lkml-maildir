"every one of us who can't wait" do not count, because they do nothing.
If you want reiser4 included into mainline, do something. Like download
a patch and try to use it.
Last time I tried, it didn't work. Kernel locked up. Namesys was quick
with fix for the lockup, but then "ls ." failed to work. I sent all
the data (kernel version, fs image, etc) to Namesys but after several
email iterations it died out with no resolution.
I will try again sometime. Maybe it got better.

Your reply wasn't polite/useful either.
