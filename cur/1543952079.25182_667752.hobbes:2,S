Since it's already only used on x86-32 and we no longer support 
non-regparm x86, I'd like to at least get to the point where x86-32 
doesn't have any function.  We can retain it for documentation's sake, 
but even then it's iffy... is "this is callable from assembly" really 
something arch-invariant.
