it's a via motherboard, so yes, i'll be trying that patch if 2.6.11 does 
work.  It seems to make sense to try the patch first, but i had already 
removed the 2.6.12 trees i had compiled before that patch was posted.  
It takes a while for this computer to compile the kernels so i'll report 
back tonight ...  in any case, if the patch doesn't work, i'll move up 
the rc for 2.6.12 until the problem occurs, figure out what happened 
with the 8139 drivers in that patchset and hopefully see a fix. But 
first, a concert to goto.
has anyone had their problem fixed by the patch to 2.6.12?
