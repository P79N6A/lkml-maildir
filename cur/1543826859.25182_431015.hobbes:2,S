OK, if you put it like that, and you're going to be consistent by
declaring the disabling of __might_sleep() warnings to be sucky too,
then I suppose we can buy that argument.
Yes, we need to sort out the early boot code. It isn't so much that
we're unable as that nobody's really tried very hard. People seem scared
of it -- they even invent pointless special cases like the
'earlyconsole' crap instead of just registering the damn consoles
earlier, for example. Register_console() has _always_ worked right from
the beginning of setup_arch(), and I've often put it there.
Let's make a concerted effort to reorder the startup code so that we
_can_ enable interrupts and have slab working quite early. Ben's plans
for this look sane enough to me.
