hello,
i use reisefs on my video-record-system as filesystem.
at the first time, i have a memory-problem, which produce an error in the reiserfs-
file-system.
reiserfsck don't find this error, only a rebuild tree make the system usable again.
after correction of all hardware-errors, this system runs fine.
this errors with reiserfs can also happens, if the system crashed or hangs with a 
software bug or a io-error on harddisk.
if the reiserfs-driver comes to this error, no more access to this hd is possible and it 
is not possible, to shutdown the system. i must press the reset-key or shut off the 
power.
if you have a tool, which can generate some reports, if it checks the filesystems, to 
help you, so solve this bug, i can use this tool next time, i have problems with the 
reiserfs.
i will check one partion in the next time, while the system hangs one time, after 
accessing this disk. at the moment, i copy all files to an other disk.
thank you and goodby
