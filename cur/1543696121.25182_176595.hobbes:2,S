Hi,
I'm seeing quite a large context switch speed regression as reported
by lmbench when I patched from test9 to test9-mm2.
The obvious thing I can see from the patch is the PF_DEAD finish_task_switch
change. I don't have time to investigate further tonight though.
lmbench two 0 sized processes context switch times go from around 1.80us to
2.60us on my PIII 650 (UP).
