AFAIU readpage is fine as long as there is no backing store. But if
the page is in the swap cache, the lookup of the page in the page
cache will fail; generic_file_read, loop, sendfile will allocate a
page and call readpage with that. Now readpage has to copy the swap
cache page over to this page :-(
IMHO Copying on swapin is really not worth the additional
functionality.
Did I miss something?
