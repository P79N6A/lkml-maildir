This is true, but there are a number of pieces that are required
before fork will work for processes using userspace verbs.  One of the
ingredients that's missing is adding something like PROT_DONTCOPY for
mprotect().  Once that's in place, an app can use that on the
doorbell page before forking.
I don't consider this attack by children of a process very serious,
since a process can always fork, munmap the doorbell page in the child
process, and then fork the untrusted child into yet another child.
