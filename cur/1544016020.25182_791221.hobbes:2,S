So the Linux Kernels comments are only for native speakers of English 
that are familiar with these colloquialisms?
I also would have to think longer about the current comment than i would 
have to on the patched one.
When we reduce parentheses and have coding style definitions to make the 
reading of source code easy and fast - why don't we fix these 
colloquialisms that are confusing non-native English speakers?
I personally would vote for this particular patch - but i assume 
thousands of these patches might jam the mailing lists then :-(

Oliver
