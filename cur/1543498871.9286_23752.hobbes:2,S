But a "make dep" sometimes is necessary to update the versioned
symbols, if you run with versioned symbols (and you definitely should
if you have externally compiled modules). When exactly it is necessary
is not evident to the user, so the rule of thumb I (as developer of an
external module) give to users is "always do make dep after config
change".
I know there should be a better way to handle this...
