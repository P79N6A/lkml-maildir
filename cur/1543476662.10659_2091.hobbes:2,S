It locks up tight.
During boot-up the SCSI subsystem is initialized with no errors. Local
partitions are mounted, then /etc/init.d/network is called. The
following appears (this is the log entry from an SMP kernel boot since
the lock-up in the non-SMP kernel prevents any info being written to
the logs).

Nothing else appears. I have to hard-reset or powercycle.
