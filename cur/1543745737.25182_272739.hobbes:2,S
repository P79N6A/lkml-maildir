Btw, if you are going to look at doing this rss thing, you need to make 
sure that thread exit ends up adding its rss to _some_ remaining sibling. 
I guess that was obvious, but it's worth pointing out. That may actually
be the only case where we do _not_ have a nice SMP-safe access: we do have
a stable sibling (tsk->thread_leader), but we don't have any good
serialization _except_ for taking mmap_sem for writing. Which we currently
don't do: we take it for reading (and then we possibly upgrade it to a
write lock if we notice that there is a core-dump starting).
We can avoid this too by having a per-mm atomic rss "spill" counter. So 
exit_mm() would basically do:
	...
	tsk->mm = NULL;
	atomic_add(tsk->rss, &mm->rss_spill);
	...
and then the algorithm for getting rss would be:
	rss = atomic_read(mm->rss_spill);
	for_each_thread(..)
		rss += tsk->rss;
Or does anybody see any better approaches?
