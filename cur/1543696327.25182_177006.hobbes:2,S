I have been writing a block driver for SSFDC compliant SMC cards. This stuff 
allocates 16k blocks.  When I get requests the transfers are split into the 
size I specifty in the blksize_size{MAJOR] array. It sems that most things 
set this to 1k. In my case this causes a performance problem  as I have to 
end up doing 16 * (16K write,  16K read, 16k erase)  to write and verify a 
16k block which has been previously written.
 
I increased this size to 4k and now I only need 4 * this lot. !deally I would 
like to do 1. However if I set the block size to 16k the module installation 
crashes when I call register_disk. 
I guess I could deal with the request queue myself but I would just like to 
know if there is a 4k limit or I have some other bug.
Many Thanks
Simon.
