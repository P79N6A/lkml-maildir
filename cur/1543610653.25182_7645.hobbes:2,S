ok, i haven't tested this and don't even know if this works here. i for
now belive that it will work but that error has a _reason_ to happen for
some unknown issues. i'd better go for a cleaner solution right now then
forcing some crashes that _may_ happen because of borked _assembly_ code
that may be generated..
what i am thinking now (and i may be wrong). let's say i compile it your
way everything will be fine no visible errors and so on. now i use that
driver. everything works but under certain circumstances it may jump
into that CASE and crash because the compilers wasn't able to create a
clean code for it.
at least it was a quick solution to solve my personal needs that i
wanted to share with others maybe people not so involved into fixing
stuff.
but thank you. i will try this one out as soon as i update my kernel :)
