Subject: [PATCH] deal with lack of acpi prt entries gracefully
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Instead of going into an infinite loop because the list isn't setup yet,
just return NULL if there are no prt entries.
