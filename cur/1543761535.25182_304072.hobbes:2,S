Just provide a patch which does this. Hint: this is highly nontrivial.
If you boot a kernel, that does not know swsusp (and if it knew, it
would have invalidated the suspend image in the swap), or which does not
have the necessary information (because of a missing resume= parameter),
this kernel cannot do much.
