Hmm.
Putting our two statements together, we obviously never need system calls
at all, and I should just stop doing this silly kernel :)
But I agree. As far as sysconf is concerned there are two "system
configuration" cases:
 - doesn't change. No system call necessary, because we might as well set
   it up with the file in /etc/sysconf or whatever.
 - does change. In which case even _asking_ for a maximum is fairly
   suspect, because you cannot depending on it being the "true" maximum.
Note that there may well be per-user limits etc, but as far as the kernel
is concerned those are not sysconf values, they are more akin to ulimit().
And obviously "sysconf()" can ask for ulimit() kind of things if it wants
to. The issue of those kinds of limits is actually fairly interesting, and
Linux could benefit from having more of them (especially of the "per-user"
variety, considering the "use up all the file descriptors" attacks etc).
