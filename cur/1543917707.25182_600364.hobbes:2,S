I think there needs to be a "sense of fairness" attached here - CodingStyle
should cover all the stuff maintainers/reviewers are allowed to whinge about.
Otherwise, we get maintainers whinging about undocumented style rules, and
we get code submitters who are unhappy because they have no real way to tell
if their code really *is* stylistically lacking, or if they just have a
jerk maintainer who wants to keep their code out-of-tree for political
reasons.
