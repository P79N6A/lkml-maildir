Is someone actively working on USB Suspend/Resume support yet?
I ask because this is becoming more and more important as people
shift more to portable notebook computers with Linux.
Enabling CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND is currently a surefire way to
guarantee crashing my own notebook on suspend/resume,
whereas it *usually* (but not always) survives when that
config option is left unset.
Nothing complicated in the configuration -- just a USB mouse,
but that's enough to nuke it.
Anyone looking at that stuff right now?
