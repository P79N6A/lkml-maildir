Having fixed arrays for extenions is generally a bad design, yes.
Also selection of those extensions by magic number is very very bad,
IMHO we should replace it with a by-name selection before any other
transformation is added to the kernel so we can just special-case the
existing two onesand stop worrying about magic numbers.
