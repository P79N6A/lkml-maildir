Hi Bernd,
CC'ed hpa, since I'm sure he can give useful advise on that :-)

Not that urgent, but if you resubmit please do it :-)

But the kernel cannot continue from that position. You would need a "soft" panic,
which allows behavior of panic=X, but let the kernel continue.
Even better is to continue with the init in the builtin ramfs. That should always
be available and can implement any behavior desired (like droping into a dash).

I didn't say that. Just if you cannot continue due to admin error, 
but the kernel is in a perfect valid state otherwise,
dumping stack is next to useless.
