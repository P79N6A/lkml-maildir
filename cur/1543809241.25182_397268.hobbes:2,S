I don't get your point:
You don't need INPUT modular for hotplugging devices.
In the normal EMBEDDED=n cases, users already do not have the choice of 
making INPUT modular.
If someone is working in an environment that is that space limited that 
he sets EMBEDDED=y, why on earth should he enable module support that 
uses relatively much space in his kernel?
