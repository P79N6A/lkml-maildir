Please think about it this way:
suppose you haave a heavily loaded router and some network problem is to
be diagnosed. You run tcpdump and suddenly router becomes overloaded (by
switching to timestamp-it-all mode), drops OSPF adjancecies etc. Users
are angry, and you can't diagnose anything. But with impresise
timestamps and maybe even with reordered packets you still have some
traces to analyze.
So, in this particular corner case it's not that lame.
Or maybe patching tcpdump will do better?
