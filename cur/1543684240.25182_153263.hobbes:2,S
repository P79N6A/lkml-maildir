...we tried and experiement some more, here the results:
   - first we had old modutils (now: module-init-tools 0.9.13pre)
   - all modules are able to load now (loaded: aes,loop,cryptoloop)
   - losetup -e aes /dev/hda1 /dev/loop0 
      --> ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: invalid argument
   - mount /dev/hda1 / -o loop,encryption=aes
      --> asks for pass, but doesn't unencrypt it
         --> it fails to mount the xfs filesystem below
            --> "mount: you must specify fs type..."
the filesystem on hda1 is encrypted with a 128 bit key / aes.

oh..btw, the ramdisk is ext2..

looks like the losetup is the problem...

..which you are gonna fix ? :)

hopefully we'll get it soon..
my co-worker has to switch between 2.4 and 2.6 daily now..
