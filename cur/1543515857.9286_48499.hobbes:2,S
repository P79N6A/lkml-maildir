	No, continue checking state, but don't add to wait queues. I thought all
along that the reason poll was so inefficient was because you had to go on
O(n) wait queues only to be taken off of them if you don't block.

	Signal delivery is O(n) with respect to the number of connections. Poll is
O(1) (see below).

	Poll is O(1) as well if implemented correctly. Consider the following loop:
	while(1)
	{
	 Poll();
	 Do_the_io_poll_found();
	}
	Now, poll itself is O(n), but doing the I/O is going to be O(n) (here n
represents the number of fds or clients). So we make a call that is O(n)
with a frequency that is O(1/n). Hence the overall overhead of poll is O(1)
with respect to the number of active connections. Signals can't touch that
scalability.
