   Well after all I got my ISAPnP modem working on Linux.  I never had
   to do an actual ISAPnP config before, but now I gess it is mandatory.
   This is what I learned: 
   * pnpdump --config >/etc/isapnp.conf
   (some changes may need to be made to /etc/isapnp.conf to work correctly)
   * isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf
   * setserial /dev/modem auto_irq autoconfig
   And it's done.  Pretty nice, but it seems like a longer process now,
   not what you would call progress if you ask me...
If the serial device driver knows about your PNP modem, it will
autoconfigure it.   Send me your isapnp.conf file, and I can deal with
it.  There is also generic PNP serial patch which I will be integrating
in soon.....
