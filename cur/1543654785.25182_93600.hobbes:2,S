The big problem is when multiple gateways to news exist in multiple
hierarchies. News servers accept a certain message only once - and
the only thing that is looked at is the message-id.
So if your news server gets fa.linux.kernel and linux.kernel, half
of the articles will end up in the first group and half of the
articles in the second.
That's why it's not a good idea anymore to read linux-kernel etc
mailinglists through news, you'll miss a lot of articles. Unless
you do the gatewaying yourself and have enough of a clue to
prevent the above scenario.
