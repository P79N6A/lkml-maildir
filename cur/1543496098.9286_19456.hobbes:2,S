HELP!
      I have recently upgraded to 2.2.9 Most things are working
except my sound card. If I comile a non SMP kernel my soudncard
works fine, but if I compile an SMP kernel, and then go to play
a sound my system completely hangs. It used to work on an SMP
2.0.36 kernel, but now ceases.   
      I am using RH6.0, with kernel 2.2.9. 
      I have a Soundblaster AWE 64 (ISA)
      I have DUAL Pentium 233MMX
      I have 128 Meg of RAM
      My first guess is that it has something to do with the
IO-APIC? But that is a guess. It maybe that the SB card cannot
hanle its IRQ being swapped between CPU's?
How do I get more info about this? How do I find out if iother
are having this problem.
Joe
