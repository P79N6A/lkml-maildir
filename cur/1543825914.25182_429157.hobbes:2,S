The latter is what Ingo's patch doesn't really do and the first should 
stay in -mm. If we talk about an -mm only patch we can relax the rules a 
little, my NACK was for mainline inclusion. The problem is that my request 
for a -mm only patch and other changes has been met with utter ignorance 
so far by Ingo.

Well, if you don't want to enable a number of options, it's still better 
to hide them completely. There are number of options by reorganizing the 
debug menu a little, it only depends if we're talking here are about a -mm 
only crutch or something which might be useful to more than a handful of 
people. A few extra config options are not really a problem as long as 
they are logically grouped together (instead of having to enable random 
options all over the place).
