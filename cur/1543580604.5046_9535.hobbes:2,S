Probably, the empty SIGPIPE handler triggered. The response to this is a
lot of shutdown() close() and finally an exit().
The trace you give above looks like the child process trace. I always see
the parent process go nuts. The parent process is almost always blocking
on read() of a unix dgram socket, which it shares with the child. The
child does a shutdown() on this socket just before exit().
