While there's a certain level of control on what DT_* may appear in the
vDSO, not even considering other than the above types seems fragile to
me. Since future additions to the set are supposedly following a fixed
scheme (distinguishing pointers and values via the low bit when below
OLD_DT_LOOS, and using sub-ranges when between DT_HIOS and
OLD_DT_HIOS), at least also handling those would seem like a good
idea, as would warning about unrecognized types.
Also, even though it shouldn't matter for the final result, if doing things
spec-conforming here you should use d_un.d_ptr.
In addition to Roland's remarks about missing symbol table relocation, I
would also assume section headers, if present, should be relocated.
