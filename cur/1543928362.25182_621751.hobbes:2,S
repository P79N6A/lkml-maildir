What's happening is that there are 2 WoL settings: one in the BIOS and
one in the NIC's NVRAM.  For WoL to work, I think both settings have to
be enabled.  Apparently in this case, when you turn off WoL in the BIOS,
the NVRAM's WoL setting is unchanged, and will be seen by tg3 as
enabled.
Ideally, the BIOS should modify the NVRAM's setting when it is changed.
We will talk to Dell to get their opinion on this as this is very
confusing to the user.
Thanks.
