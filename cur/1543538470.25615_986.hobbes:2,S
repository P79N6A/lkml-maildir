Torsten,
I indeed stumbled into the same problem, and it seems to be GRUB's fault.
0.5.93.1 was working *flawlessly* for me, and then 0.5.94 stuffed up - it
reported installing fine, but on boot, it did not do a thing. There was only
that cute little Award BIOS bit telling me about my system. And then a
blinking cursor. It obstinately persisted in doing that. I fell back to
0.5.93.1. It worked fine. Bitch at the GNU GRUB people ;)
