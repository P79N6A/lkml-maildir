Hi list,
I have an Adaptec 2110S controller on an A7M266-D dual AMD Athlon MP
rig running a Debian Sarge 3.1 stable.
I am considering which driver between i2o and dpt-i2o using: according
to your experience which one is preferrable performance and reliably
wise?
I have installed the i2o native driver and the linux kernel change the
order of my disk (like /dev/sda became /dev/i2o/hdc): is there any way to
have a consistent drive order (i.e. /dev/sda -> /dev/i2o/hdc)?
Last question: I started with the dpt-i2o and installed grub on the first 
disk array, then I moved to the i2o native driver (statically compiled in 
the kernel), without appling any patch and everything runs smoothly: how is 
this possible? I would have expected some errors with frub not recognizing 
the /dev/i2o/hdx devices.
Ciao
