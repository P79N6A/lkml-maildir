blk_cleanup_queue() still does that, as does blk_put_queue() (same deal,
each drop a reference, last reference frees the queue).
This first patch is just the frame work, the only thing that's
referenced counted right now is that the returned object has one
reference and when the driver cleans the queue it drops the reference
causing it to be freed. Next step is making sure others that hold a
reference to the queue also grab a reference to it, using
blk_get_queue(). That's stuff like bdev_get_queue(), for instance.

blk_alloc_queue() would be fine. However, it's hard to screw the usage
up since it returns a queue, so... And people with out-of-tree drivers
that need to be converted need only look at the blk_init_queue()
changes, easy to grep for.
