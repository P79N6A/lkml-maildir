 How many users would want to actually modify the syscall parameters
or change visible system behavior when a syscall happens?
 Maybe something like this would work?
  1.  You can register to be notified when a syscall occurs,
      either before or after or both.
  2.  The only action you can take must be 'private' (within
      your driver or subsystem.)
