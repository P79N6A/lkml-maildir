I'm at a bit of a loss to guess what might have changed in powerpc code
that would explain this. I've added the linuxppc-dev mailing list in
case they can make a guess.
I think you are also going to need to start bisecting searching
specifically for the patch that causes these overwrites.

It's a virtual address so it depends on the value of CONFIG_KERNEL_START
as to whether this is a user program address or not.
