Just to make sure that's wrong. I actually used it.
And yes admittedly they made a long haul since those days in terms
of security.
And for your record:
1. CP/M
2. SunOS4-5, Solwlaris 6, 8 (intel and sparc flavours where applicable)
3. FreeBSE 3.x 4.x... (nice with the exception of the default shell)
4. OSF/1, OSF/2 (they managed to make an Alpha appear slow)
5. AIX (forget the version but they are usually high)
6. IRIX (even unix can be instable...)
7. VMS on VAX (I hate FORTRAN I hate FORTRAN I hate FORTRAN)
8. ULTRIX (classical stuff not as bad as many people think...)
10.  ... some wired kind of UNIX running on a NEC SX3R
11. similar shit on Cray III...
12. something called OS on a transputer system I already forgot about...
and so on and so on.
Just counting the stuff I actually wrote some code for...
and still remember
