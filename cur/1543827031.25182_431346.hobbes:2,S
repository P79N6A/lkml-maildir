Subject: Plans to obsolete register_chrdev()?

Hello,
In Linux 2.6, character device driver developers are supposed to use 
alloc_chrdev_region() and cdev_add() instead of register_chrdev(). See 
http://lwn.net/images/pdf/LDD3/ch03.pdf
 or 
http://lwn.net/Articles/126808/
 .
However, in 2.6.16, there are still *very few* uses of cdev_add(). 
Compare 
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=cdev_add
 to 
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=register_chrdev
 .
Are there plans to officially obsolete register_chrdev() (in particular 
through Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt)?
Unless register_chrdev() is supposed to stay, I'll be glad to 
participate in converting character driver code. In particular, would 
updateds to drivers/chars/mem.c file be welcome?
Cheers,
    Michael.
