In other words, you leave the kernel allocating its own memory on
demand?

Or populating a sparse matrix in memory. How would you implement this
without overcommit/demand-allocation??

Yes, it keeps odd chunks of RAM and VM free for itself. Not enough to
guarantee any arbitrary operation would succeed without allocating
more, though - and why should it?
