You need 64bit (or at least more than 32bit) for the seconds,
otherwise you add a y2038 problem which would be sad in new code.
Remember you might be still alive then ;-)
Ok one could argue that on 32bit architectures 2038 is so deeply
embedded that it doesn't make much difference, but I still
think it would be better to not readd it to new interfaces there.
64bit longs on 32bit is fine, as long as you use aligned_u64,
never long long or u64 (which has varying alignment between i386 and x86-64)
