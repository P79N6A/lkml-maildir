Actually, you're missing Al's point completely: kmod doesn't even
begin to answer the basic question of which user to ask, as it doesn't
have to make that decision in the first place.

Probably the "Every time you swear on a mailing list, you donate a
week's wages to the <CHARITY TYPE=WELL-KNOWN SELECT=RANDOM> as
reparation for doing so" interface.
I for one see NO reason for use of language like that in a mailing
list, and tend to assume that those who resort to such language do so
because they realise they have lost whatever argument they are trying
to make, but are too stupid to admit such.
Best wishes from Riley.
