That's why I asked. :)

The curse of 3 am posting, I thought the patch was about something else 
(generic syscall registration for third party modules as mentioned months ago 
on the list) in the 5 seconds I glanced at it.  Having now actually read the 
thing with both eyes focused, it's just sticking bodies on two already 
reserved syscalls, which is pretty low impact, yeah. :)
(Although this mechanism could be USED for generic syscall registration by 
third parties that don't intend to use streams, only want two syscalls, and 
don't care deeply about their arguments.  But it's exported GPL so that would 
only ever be likely to be used for debugging purposes...)
To answer the original question for Dave: Alan Cox has now seen it, so life is 
probably good for you.
