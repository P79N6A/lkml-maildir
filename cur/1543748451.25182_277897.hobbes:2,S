I've built a boot cd with linux-2.6.10-rc3, udev 048 and latest hotplug.
When I boot a machine with my CD, udev doesn't create /dev/hda
I can't fathom why. Any reasons why it wouldn't create it?
It _has_ created /dev/hdc, (the cdrom drive) and all the other usual devices.
/proc/ide shows hda->ide0/hda
/proc/ide/ide0/hda/model = MAXTOR 6L040J2
This is a simple Asus P4PE m/b with intel ICH4 IDE.
( I know I can mknod, but since this is supposed to be a general purpose 
boot/toolkit CD, I'd like to make sure udev is working properly)
Any clues? hda currently contains windows server and I'm rather eager to wipe 
it ;)
