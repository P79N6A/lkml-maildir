Of course, dev being your pci device and direction the data direction --
PCI_DMA_TODEVICE etc, see linux/pci.h.

nents is the number if segments in the sglist you are supplying as well.
not the maximum number of entries the driver can handle.

No you have to allocate this structure yourself.

You are not terribly good a grepping, it seems :-). The function is in
asm/pci.h, depending on the architecture you may have to look inside
arch/ for helpers too.
