Currently that's a userspace issue.  There's a /etc/fuse.conf file,
with two options:
  max_mounts=X
  user_allow_other
The fusermount helper reads this file, and decides if passing the
'allow_other' mount option to the kernel is OK or not.
If we want unprivileged sys_mount() these will have to be checked in
kernel (set via sysfs, etc).
