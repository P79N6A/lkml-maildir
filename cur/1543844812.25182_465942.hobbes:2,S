This isn't right, dev_queue_xmit() can return -ENETDOWN and still
free the SKB, so your change will cause the SKB to be freed up
twice in that case, from dev_queue_xmit():
	rc = -ENETDOWN;
	rcu_read_unlock_bh();
out_kfree_skb:
	kfree_skb(skb);
	return rc;
dev_queue_xmit() is basically expected to consume the packet,
error or not.
What case of calling dev_queue_xmit() did you discover that did not
kfree the SKB on error?  We should fix that.  On a quick scan on the
entire dev_queue_xmit() implmentation, I cannot find such a case.
