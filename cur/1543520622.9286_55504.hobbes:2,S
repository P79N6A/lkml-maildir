Ok. I'll try this too.

Hmm? I thought that NMI oopser is only applicable to 2.3 kernels..

But I see stack trace even without NMI oopser (from __global_cli)
Or do you want to get trace from second CPU too?
It is in BH handler. And I am suspect that it is in BH handler from serial...
Anyway, thanks.
Bye,
