I'd try to check with other machine using "secondary" bus slot.
BTW: Are you able to analyze the "primary" bus transactions while
using the card in "secondary" bus? Perhaps there is something
wrong in front of the motherboard bridge?
A broken motherboard may be hard to diagnose, unfortunately.
Can you post something like "lspci -vv" taken on both machines?
