Hi,
  I've just built 2.3.31 on my Alpha (LX164/21164A) and while it mostly
works fine I believe I'm having problems associated with the Sys V IPC
shared memory (which before anyone asks is compiled in!).
  The problems are showing up as some X programs aborting; in particular I
can't run any Gnome applications without --no-xshm (in which case they
work fine), but I've tried one or two other applications which use XSHM
and they also appear to have the problem; programs which do not use it are
fine.
  I'm running XFree 3.916 on a 3DFx Voodoo 3 (Its actually the XFree
version off 3DFx's site).  This works fine with 2.2.13; I can't try a
range of 2.3.x's because most other versions have PCI brokednesses on this
machine.
  The error from Gnome apps is:
Gdk-ERROR **: BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)
  serial 111 error_code 10 request_code 129 minor_code 3
aborting...
A diff of the /proc/sysvipc/shm before and after the gnome app was run
reveals differences like:
 key    shmid perms     size  cpid  lpid nattch  uid gid cuid cgid
atime      dtime      ctime
 0   37158914   777   262144 15725 15558      0 9031 800 9031  800
944942965  944942966  944942965
Two things I can notice which are odd about this (but I haven't gone back
to a previous version to look):
    1) The shmid is a great big hairy number.
    2) The perms are rather open!
Tracing through the Gnome error appears to come from Imlib just before one
of the XShm calls.
Ideas?
Dave
