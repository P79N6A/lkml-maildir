Although you do have a point, this is not really true.
For my stuff and several other maintainers, the patches generally appear 
To: <maintainer> CC: <mailing list>.  I specificially ask submittors to 
always CC a mailing list.
It is true that the maintainers (subsystem maintainers like me, or 
overall maintainers like Andrew and Linus) sometimes check in patches 
without much review, but even there, I usually send things that would be 
remotely controversial to the linux-ide/netdev/linux-kernel lists.
