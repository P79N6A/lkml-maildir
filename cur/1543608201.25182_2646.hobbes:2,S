Yes, it does, my race protection is bogus. Petr Vandrovec also pointed out
that. So we do need either to
 a) stuff jiffies_hi and jiffies_last into one atomic type
    (16 bits is enough for each) or
 b) use locking.
My next patch will use b), but I won't do it until I have resolved the
most annoying stability issues. I won't have time to do this before the
weekend, and don't want to bother the list too much either.
Maybe the lockups are just due to my setting of INITIAL_JIFFIES instead of
waiting 471 days. The time adjustment routines are good candidates for
this kind of mistakes. Any ideas anyone where else I might have forgotten
to introduce INITIAL_JIFFIES ?
