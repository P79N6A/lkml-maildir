Subject: Build TAGS problem with O=

If you try:
make O=/usr/src/ver/2.6.13-rc/obj/ -j5 LOCALVERSION=_2.6.13-rc TAGS ARCH=i386
it fails with:
   MAKE   TAGS
find: security/selinux/include: No such file or directory
find: include: No such file or directory
find: include/asm-i386: No such file or directory
find: include/asm-generic: No such file or directory
The problem seems to be this bit of the topdir Makefile:
#We want __srctree to totally vanish out when KBUILD_OUTPUT is not set
#(which is the most common case IMHO) to avoid unneeded clutter in the big tags 
file.
#Adding $(srctree) adds about 20M on i386 to the size of the output file!
ifeq ($(KBUILD_OUTPUT),)
__srctree =
else
__srctree = $(srctree)/
endif
It would appear that the "ifeq ($(KBUILD_OUTPUT),)" is doing the wrong thing.  I 
am not a make expert, but I have had a lot of BAD experience trying to use this 
construct.  Any one up to proposing a fix?
