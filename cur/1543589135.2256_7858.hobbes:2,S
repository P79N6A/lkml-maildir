First:
% cat /proc/partitions 
major minor  #blocks  name
   3     0   20010816 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
   3     1     192748 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
   3     2     249007 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2
   3     3          1 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3
   3     5     289138 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part5
   3     6    1951866 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part6
   3     7     979933 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part7
   3     8   16346106 ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part8
  33     0   80043264 ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
  33     1   80035798 ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
So its already right.
Secondly with devfs, why not just scan all /dev/discs/?
% ls -l /dev/discs 
total 0
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root           30 Jan  1  1970 disc0 -> ../ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root           30 Jan  1  1970 disc1 -> ../ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/
Also if lvm opens all known devices by way of /dev/whatever while
scanning, it will only find existing devices there with devfs.
