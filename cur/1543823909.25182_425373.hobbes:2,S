This is Version 5 of the genirq patch-queue, against 2.6.17-rc4. The 
genirq patch-queue improves the generic IRQ layer to be truly generic, 
by adding various abstractions and features to it, without impacting 
existing functionality. It converts ARM, i386 and x86_64 to this new 
generic IRQ layer - while keeping compatibility with all the other 
genirq architectures too.
The full patch-queue can be downloaded from:

genirq -V5 is mostly about fixes and smaller cleanups. Suggestions from 
many people were included - let us know if anything is missing. It has 
been tested on i386, x86_64 and ARM systems.
Changes since -V4:
 - fix: added IRQ_INPROGRESS protection to the fastack, level and simple
   flow handlers, to avoid irq reentry due to hardware bugs. (especially 
   on SMP this is not unheard of.)
 - fix: fixed two old-style IRQ probing bugs on non-irqchip
   architectures.
 - fix: bad irq vectors should increase the IRQ kstat too
 - feature: added IRQ_DELAYED_DISABLE support for edge-irq handling on 
   really dumb controllers.
 - docs: various documentation and comment updates
 - cleanup/speedup: cleaned up desc->depth and IRQ_DISABLED handling - 
   the two were not always in sync. Made the generic flow handlers use
   IRQ_DISABLED instead of desc->depth - results in more optimal code.
 - cleanup: introduced generic_handle_irq(irq) for architectures to call 
   when they want the generic layer to handle an interrupt.
 - rename: renamed probe_lock to probing_active
 - rename: renamed handle_level_irq_fastack to handle_fastack_irq - 
   there is no strict requirement of the trigger type of the irq.
