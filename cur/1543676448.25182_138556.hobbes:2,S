It turns out I picked up "hose" from the PowerPC code.
I always thought of it as something that sprays data.
To be really clear, "superbus" is descriptive.
While "bridge" is no good, "hostbridge" works.
Anyway, how about some substance?
I suppose sysfs can just change, since there wasn't
a sysfs filesystem in the 2.4.xx kernels.
Fixing up /proc/bus/pci isn't terribly bad,
assuming the PCI structs could hold per-bar
proc filesystem entries. I hope there isn't
an objection to that.
For mmap, I'm thinking this:
#define MAP_MMIO (MAP_ARCH_FOO | MAP_ARCH_BAR)
That is, MAP_MMIO is defined in terms of
arch-specific flags that are appropriate for
typical memory-mapped IO. The old ioctl()
takes priority.
Another way to do this is via filename, which
is kind of ugly but great for non-mmap usage.
