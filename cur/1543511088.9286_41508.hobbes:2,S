In the time that the card has been available, they haven't
exactly released betas very often too, hence the low revision
numbers. It makes you wonder if there is actually any development
going on.
Shame, because it's a damn good card.
Maybe someone should reverse-engineer it, and hack up an
opensourced driver :)
