How is "find" going to be fixed in 2.3?  This is interesting to me as
I'm writing an optimised replacement for "find" the program.

I assume you mean "find" the program.  Do you?
That has considerable CPU overhead as well as I/O because it churns the
dcache and icache constantly, so the kernel spends a fair amount of time
making decisions about what it can prune.  I've noticed the kernel can
get into a state where it spends more time doing this, or a state where
it spends less time doing it, but I've no consistent way to trigger
either state.
