Subject: [PATCH] remove outdated/misleading CPU scheduler comments
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/31/101

This patch removes two outdated/misleading comments from the CPU scheduler.
1) The first comment removed is simply incorrect. The function it 
comments on is not used for what the comments says it is anymore.
2) The second comment is a leftover from when the "if" block it comments 
on contained a goto. It does not any more, and the comment doesn't make 
sense.
There isn't really a reason to add different comments, though someone 
might feel differently in the case of the second one. I'll leave adding 
a comment to anybody who wants to - more important to just get rid of 
them now.
