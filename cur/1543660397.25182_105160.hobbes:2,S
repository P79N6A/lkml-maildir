Ah, the force of evil have gone from hiring people to write letters to
congressmen and editors to posting trolls in mailing lists...
The truth is that HP is selling Linux machines now for desktop use,
Wal-Mart (of all places) is selling them, mail order houses are starting
to offer Linux installed... the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal coexisted for
millenia, Linux can coexist with an evolutionary dead end as well. Only I
suspect that it will be a few decades in this case.
Don't believe that the desktop drives the computer room, either. The
dollar drives both, and if non-tech companies like Boscov's department
store are going to Linux servers, I would assume the cost of Windows on
the desktop isn't invisible in those places. Erosion is barely visible
until the landslide.
