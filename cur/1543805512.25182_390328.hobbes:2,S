Russell,
By "written stupidly", I thought Richard meant they could have
used constants instead of "s".  e.g.:
	if (word << 16 == 0) { b += 16; word >>= 16); }
	if (word << 24 == 0) { b +=  8; word >>=  8); }
	if (word << 28 == 0) { b +=  4; word >>=  4); }
But I prefer what Edgar Toernig suggested.
