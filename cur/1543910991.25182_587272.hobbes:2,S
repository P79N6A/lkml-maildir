Agreed that a userspace program is triggering the console switch (the
boot logo normally disappears when the VC fonts get loaded), but what
changed to make this happen where it wasn't happening before?  I've
obviously got some more detective work to do, but I had discounted the
possibility of a user space software update being responsible: the
Debian stable series tends not to have many updates...  Hmmm...  I
recently updated libc6 and related packages (locales, tzdata, etc.).
I don't think I'm going to track this down anytime soon, but the first
step would be to determine which init script is involved.
