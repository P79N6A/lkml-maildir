My understanding from the c90/c99 standards is that hexadecimal
constants may result in signed or unsigned types. Contrarily, decimal
constants always result in integer types, if no signed suffix is
given.
However, I made this change only to unify 32 and 64 bit implementation
and took already existing code from the 64 bit version.
