The non-overloaded call chain notification with dynamic registeration/unregistration 
is much better than earlier one. But if you still want to improve the 35 nSec
slowdown, then the only other alternative is to eliminate the call chain and 
try calling kprobe_exceptions_notify() directly with the kprobe_running() around it.
i.e
static inline int notify_page_fault(enum die_val val, const char *str,
                        struct pt_regs *regs, long err, int trap, int sig)
{
	if(kprobe_running())
	{
        	struct die_args args = {
               	 .regs = regs,
               	 .str = str,
               	 .err = err,
               	 .trapnr = trap,
               	 .signr = sig
		return kprobe_exceptions_notify(NULL, &die_args, DIE_PAGE_FAULT);
	}
}
Anyone has any other comments/suggestion?
-thanks,
Anil
