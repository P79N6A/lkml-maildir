It's not that we need a tree; it's just that we need to take dependency
information into account with system devices, and those aren't necessarily
related to ancestry. That relates to the fact that not enough system
devices have been converted, and not enough time has been spent, to really
understand the dependency information enough to fix the model.
As for the wireless device, I would suggest modifying the driver so that
it retries the hotplug event. Or, perhaps it could be converted to use a
mechanism in which events are not lost (kevents maybe?).
