Where is this flush_work() call?  lru_add_drain_all()->schedule_on_each_cpu()?
If so, and if that is the only such callsite then we could/should
rework this code to use work_on_cpu(), if we manage to fix that thing.
It would be somewhat inefficient.  It would be better if work_on_cpu()
were to take a cpumask argument, and avoid blocking behind each CPU one
at a time.  But first things first.
