good commercial drivers dont need fixing. another point. You are arguing 
that having source is required to fix crappy code, which i agree with.
You "guys" like to have source, and there is nothing wrong with that. But 
requiring that all code be distributed as source DOES stifle innovation. 
Its as simple as that.
