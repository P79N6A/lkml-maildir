Hi Robert,
In the past I suggested that it might be useful to have a version of perfmon2 
that only set up the perfmon on a global basis. That would allow the patches for 
context switches to be added as a separate step, splitting up the patch into 
smaller set of patches.
Perfmon2 uses a set of system calls to control the performance monitoring 
hardware. This would make it difficult to use an unpatch kernel unless perfmon 
changed the mechanism used to control the performance monitoring hardware.
