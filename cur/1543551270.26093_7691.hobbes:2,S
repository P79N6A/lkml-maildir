Dear list,
I run a Compaq Proliant 1500 (dual Pentium 75.200) with hardware raid
(Smart2) with two ethernet cards 3com905 (b or c, I can't tell you right
now) as a firewall and web/mail virus scanner which (needless to say)
needs to be up 7d/24h.
Recently, during a pretty fast download the machine (ethernet technically,
you could login on the console, even ping the ethernet ip address) locked
up with the following error log:

... repeating ...
The problem was reproducible (several times) with the same download (a
300MB file) after a reboot. 
There should be no irq collision on irq 9, /proc/interrupts:
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:    4444438    4611949    IO-APIC-edge  timer

NMI:          0
ERR:          0
No other hardware is installed.
Another observation: Normally the free (non buffer) memory of that machine
is 3MB (of 192MB). At the point of the crash it was down to 1.7MB. I don't
know if this is the cause or just a symptom of the locked up ethernet
card.
Is this a known problem? If it's not a hardware/driver bug, I suspect an
SMP related race condition. Maybe the bios did set up the cpu's / io-apics
wrong? I should mention that now, two days later, I can no longer
reproduce the crash. 
This might be due to 2 reasons: 1) The bandwidth when downloading from the
web server was measurably slower (about 1/2) this time (about 600kbit (of
a 2Mb link)) today. 2) the machine was power cycled. Unfortunately the
personnel cannot remember if the problem was only reproducible after a
warm reboot or also after a power cycle.
Finally: /proc/version:
Linux version 2.2.14 (root@fwintern) (gcc version 2.95.2 19991024
(release)) #4 SMP Thu Aug 3 20:32:32 CEST 2000
The recent discussion on linux-kernel seems to indicate that gcc 2.95
cannot compile a kernel at all. Could this be the cause here (the system
was up since that Aug 3 flawlessly). Unfortunately there is no other
version available on that system and the distributor (Suse) seems to deny
any gcc 2.95 - kernel incompatibilies.
Please advise,
Michael.
