If the file is local, everything is fine. A file won't actually
be deleted until the last access is closed. However, the long-standing
problem with NFS is that it's `phony`. Basically, we send a message
to a server that says "Give me a directory listing...". The server
does the `opendir()` etc., and returns the results. If I want to
open a file on the server, the server has no knowledge of the `open`.
The client's software just emulated a file-system open(). When the
client wants to read data from a server's file, it sends a message;
"Gimmie data from file xxx, offset x, length y.". The server responds
with that data. To get that data, the server did an open/lseek/read/close.
So, as far as the server is concerned, that file is closed. Somebody
else (with privilege) can delete the file and replace it. The client,
the one that got the data for an executable, doesn't even know it.
This is 'nice' for the server, it doesn't have the overhead of maintaining
a file-system state. That's why servers are supposed to be read-only.
However, somebody has got to write the stuff to the file-system that's
going to (eventually) be read-only. Beware when such access occurs.
