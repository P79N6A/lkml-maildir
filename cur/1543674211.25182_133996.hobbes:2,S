I don't think this should be (purely) an arch thing.  It's just as
much a driver issue.  For example, HPET will pretty much work the same
on x86 and ia64, so being able to have a shared "driver" would be
useful.  I agree though that it would be nice if arches that don't
care for time-interpolation at all could turn it off completely.
In the proposal below, an architecture could achieve that by turning
off CONFIG_TIME_INTERPOLATION.

Sounds reasonable.
To make this really possible, I think it makes the most sense to have
the last_nsec_offset variable implemented by the generic kernel.  I'm
thinking something along the lines of the below?
Comments?
