The point is, as far as the kenrel has been concerned, "inline" has always 
meant the same thing. Not just for the last few weeks, but for the last 18 
_years_. It's always meant "always inline".

Exactly. And I argue that we shouldn't change it.
If we have too many "inline"s, and if gcc inlines for us _anyway_, then 
the answer is not to change the meaning of "inline", but simply say "ok, 
we have too many inlines. Let's remove the ones we don't care about".

And I'm agreeing with you.
What I'm _not_ agreeing with is how you want to change the semantics of 
something we've had for 18 years.
YOU are the one who want to make "inline" mean "maybe". I'm against it. 
I'm against it because it makes no sense. It's not what we've ever done.
