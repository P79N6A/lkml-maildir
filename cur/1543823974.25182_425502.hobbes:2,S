Not just for the allocation, but also for getting the address of
the second struct, after that allocation.
If the second struct has bigger alignment required than the first,
the current code gets the second struct misaligned.  Putting both
into one bigger struct would add the required padding.
(Say: sizes 4 and 8, alignment requirements 4 and 8 resp.)
