I'm going to stick my nose in here because this is just getting plain
absurd.
Having read the patent license as best I can, I'm going to ask a question
that evidently nobody has felt the need to ask plainly and clearly. Either
that, or nobody has bothered to actually read the patent license.
If I modify the Open RTLinux software that FSMLabs provides, and distribute
the modified version under the GPL, and then use a feature I added through
the modification in a program I'm distributing under a non-GPL license, am I
in violation of the Open RTLinux patent license?
This seems to be what's confusing people. And is a little confusing to me,
but my guess is that the answer is "yes, you are in violation of the patent
license".
The "use it for whatever you want unmodified" terms of the patent license
seem stupidly straightforward, so I can't see how THAT is causing any
confusion.
