At first, we have memory hot-add now. So I want to implement hot-removing 
hot-added memory, at least. (in this case, we don't have to write invasive
patches to memory-init-core.)
Our(Fujtisu's) product, ia64-NUMA server, has a feature to offline memory.
It supports dynamic reconfigraion of nodes, node-hoplug.
But there is no *shipped* firmware for hotplug yet. RHEL4 couldn't boot on
such hotplug-supported-firmware...so firmware-team were not in hurry.
It will be shipped after RHEL5 comes.
IMHO, a firmware which supports memory-hot-add are ready to support memory-hot-remove
if OS can handle it.
Note:
I heard embeded people often designs their own memory-power-off control on
embeded Linux. (but it never seems to be posted to the list.) But I don't know
they are interested in generic memory hotremove or not.
Thanks,
