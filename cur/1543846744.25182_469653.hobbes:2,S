Given this warnings still pops up from time to time, I question whether
putting that check under DEBUG_VM was such a good idea.  It's not as
if it's a major performance impact.  This has potential for us to lose
valuable debugging info for a few nanoseconds performance increase in
an already costly path.
This patch brings it back unconditionally, and moves the BUG()
into the if arm.
