Nope, It does not fix it.  It basically happens when i2c_del_driver is
called for w83781d_driver.  I did add a few printk's, but it do not
seem to be anything that w83781d_detach_client does.  Rather, it
looks to be while i2c_del_driver is walking the clients for the
adapter, after it ran w83781d_detach_client for the chip (and not the
two clients).  I am assuming it grabs the client for the main chip,
calls w83781d_detach_client which then in turn free all the memory for
the main client and the two lm75 clients, return, and then check the
next client for the adapter, which happens to be one of the lm75 clients
for who we already freed the structures ....
I hope that was sort of comprehensible.  Anyhow, I will poke at it more
tonight, if thoughts, let me know.
