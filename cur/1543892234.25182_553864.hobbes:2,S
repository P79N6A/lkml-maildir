Subject: 2.6.16.52 can't boot on Intel DG965SS

Hi,
I want to use 2.6.16.y on the Intel DG965SS mainboard, but the kernel 
stops booting:
...
ACPI: bus type pci registered
PCI: Using MMCONFIG
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20060127
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: Using IOAPIC for interrupt routing
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (0000:00)
ACPI: Assume root bridge [\_SB_.PCIO] bus is 0 
A Kernel 2.6.16.52 boots with pci=nommconf.
A SuSE 10.1 installation cd boots with no special bootparams.
A Kernel 2.6.17 vanilla boots with no special bootparams.
So something is missing in 2.6.16.y, can anyone point me to a patch or 
something else which enables this?
I know I cannot use PATA of this board, but this does not matter (and 
the e1000 driver is too old).
      Thomas
