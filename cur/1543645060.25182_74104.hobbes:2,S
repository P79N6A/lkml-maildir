Well Justin and you are both, it seems, missing the point.
I'm now saying for the 3rd time, that there's zero problem in having a
huge dirty cache backlog. This is not the problem, please disregard any
reference to that. Count only the time spent for servicing a read
request, _from when it enters the drive_ and until it completes. IO
scheduler is _not_ involved.
