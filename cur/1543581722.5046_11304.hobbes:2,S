Is there any kernel patch that would allow Linux to properly recognize,
and execute gzipped executables?
I know I could use binfmt_misc to run a wrapper script:
    decompress to /tmp/prog.decompressed
    execute /tmp/prog.decompressed
    rm /tmp/prog.decompressed
But that's not as clean, secure, or fast as the kernel transparently
decompressing & executing.  Is there a better way to do this?
