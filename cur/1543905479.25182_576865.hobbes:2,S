There's two ways to deal with it, one ugly and quick and one to do it
right.
The quick hack is to fake up a file struct similar to blkdev_get().
The proper solutions is to get rid of the file (and inode) in the
blockdev ->ioctl prototype.  Only thing keeping is from that is
floppy.c (and some cut & paste variants for m68k) due to their awkard
permission checking hacks.
