None of the original /dev/poll patches for Linux were much
good, I seem to recall; they had scaling problems and bugs.
The /dev/epoll patch is good, but the interface is different enough
from /dev/poll that ircd would need a new engine_epoll.c anyway.
(It would look like a cross between engine_devpoll.c and engine_rtsig.c,
as it would need to be notified by os_linux.c of any EWOULDBLOCK return values.
Both rtsigs and /dev/epoll only provide 'I just became ready' notification, 
but no 'I'm not ready anymore' notification.)
And then there's /dev/yapoll (
http://www.distributopia.com
), which
I haven't tried yet (I don't think the author ever published the patch?).
Anyway, the new engine wouldn't be too hard to write, and
would let irc run fast without a patched kernel.
