Thanks. Worked like a charm. Of course then i had to fix psaux legacy to 
make XFree work - and then go back for ps/2 mice.
Obviously I wasn't paying enough attention to lkml to catch this change, but 
it certainly seems like a trap for the unwary - and even the somewhat wary. 
If I could help, I'd be happy to try to fix the config options to make all 
this clearer.
