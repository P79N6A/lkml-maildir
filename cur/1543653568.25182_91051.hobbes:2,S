One word of caution to vi users: you WILL forget to unlink one day.
So, to protect me from myself, every time I untar a Linus' tree,
I immediately do:
 find linux-2.5.foo -type f | xargs chmod a-w
Then, the attached script reduces the typing. Run "deal dir/file.c"
before editing as if it was "bk edit dir/file.c".
Once you are done I always do:
 diff -urN -X dontdiff linux-2.5.48 linux-2.5.48-sparc > x.diff
This is a blazingly fast with hardlinked tree (cp -al).
-- Pete
#!/bin/sh
# This script dealiases a hardlinked file for editing.
set -e
if [ $# != 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: deal file" >&2
  exit 1
fi
f=$1
mv $f $f~
cp $f~ $f
chmod u+w $f
