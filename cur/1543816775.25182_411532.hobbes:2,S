Subject: [2.6 PATCH] add support for Papouch TMU (USB thermometer)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello Greg,
As the time flies by, I think it is better to have this patch in for now
and leave the "big mess" for later and another thread...
(the "big mess" refers as UTF-8 and other soup of encodings in kernel
code + tab and space usage).
The patch below applies (with fuzz 2, which I hope is OK) to 2.6.16 and
2.6.16.1 vanilla. The original submitter to LKML was Folkert van Heusden
and that is why I have included his name in the code. I have just
cleaned his code and fixed the style. Not sure of the order of
Signed-off-by lines, change it if you need.
The patch as submitted below was tested with the actual device by
Folkert and reported working.
This patch adds support for new vendor (papouch) and one of their
devices - TMU (a USB thermometer).
More information:

This patch is based on the submission from Folkert van Heusden [1].
Then reviseted by Kalin KOZHUHAROV [2] and retested by Folkert.
