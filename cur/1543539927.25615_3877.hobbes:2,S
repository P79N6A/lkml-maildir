So what? Whatever you are inventing, it should use a standard protocol.
Even if it has to be a new protocol.

That's what I mean: for a new feature to an existing part of the protocol,
extend that part. If it's genuinely a new area the protocol hasn't handled
before, you will need a new command - so make that part of the standard.
Can you imagine if we had one distro shipping with gcc being "Great
Cleanup Command", another with the C compiler, and a third where gcc as
root is "reformat all disks"?

It's a new command. Put it in the standard.

NO. The ATA-* driver does NOT need to know what a scanner is - only that
the scanner commands are valid ones now.
