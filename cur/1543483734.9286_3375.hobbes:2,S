Hum, both my Cyrix M-II PR300 (233 MHz = 3.5 * 66 MHz) and my AMD
K6-2/300 (300 MHz = 3.0 * 100 MHz) are rock stable here with Linux
2.0.36, 2.1.125+, 2.2.0-pre, 2.2.1. The AMD resides on a Tyan "Trinity
100AT" S1590S board (VIA Apollo MVP3 based), the Cyrix is fine in a PC
Chips M577 as well (same chip set). Uptimes around a day are fine,
average K6-2 CPU temperature (bottom site) varies around 45°C +/- 5 K.
So might it be the board itself? Might it be an APR-66 CPU pushed
beyond 66 MHz?
