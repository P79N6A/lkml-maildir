Pardon the newbie question, but am I right in understanding from this
discussion that preemption doesn't happen unless explicitly asked
for (by schedule())?  If the a driver was entered and proceeded to
do some very long term PIO without sleeping, would it prevent other
processes from running?
Or did I just miss something obvious?
