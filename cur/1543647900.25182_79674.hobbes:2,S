Hello Neil,
hello Trond,
my second try shows all the same result. The exact same setup as yesterday
night and a second try results again in very low performance. To name it:
about 11 GB of data took an incredible 13,5 hours to write to the server over a
100 MBit FDX switch.
This night I will try to reduce rsize/wsize from the current 8192 down to 1024
as suggested by Jeff.
