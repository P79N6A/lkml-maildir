No, it was the fact that Linux has always been able to run on garbage.
My introduction to Linux was in 1995 when I was given a network
of computers made out of back-laboratory garbage and US$0
software budget and told to make it work.  None of the BSDs
could cut it, but Linux could.
User space Unix tool rewrites all of which I could have gotten from
*BSD had absolutely nothing to do with it.  I doubt that I am
typical.
