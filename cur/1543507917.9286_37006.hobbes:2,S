 Hi,
 It's me again. I have finally found that it's not a bug.
 However, I think that the fact that 'ip' program takes the fwmark 
argument in hexadecimal format is rather weird. Well, I think that because
ipchains takes it in decimal, and all the other options 'ip' takes are in
decimal as well.. 
 I had to printk again in kernel to see that 'ip rule add from 0/0 fwmark
10' actually does fwmark 16..
Thanks anyway
