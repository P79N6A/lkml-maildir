There are two possibilities: use the TSC on Pentium and above, and use the
RTC on lower end machines (just set up a RTC interrupt xxx times per second
(e.g. 128), and capture the timer to get a known offset).
It would have been much better if there was a free running timer with a
compare register (shoot when timer=reg), but we have to live with 20+ years
old timers in a brain-damaged design now.
