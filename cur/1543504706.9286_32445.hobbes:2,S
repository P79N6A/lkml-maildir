I'm not sure what information that I can give, but it seems like whenever
I start going into swap, /proc/meminfo reports a loss of about 20mb of
ram. I have 128mb ram, this is what meminfo says right now:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  113889280 110219264  3670016 27848704  7651328 44867584
Swap: 134209536  7397376 126812160
MemTotal:    111220 kB
MemFree:       3584 kB
MemShared:    27196 kB
Buffers:       7472 kB
Cached:       43816 kB
SwapTotal:   131064 kB
SwapFree:    123840 kB
if there's any information that I can give, please let me know.
