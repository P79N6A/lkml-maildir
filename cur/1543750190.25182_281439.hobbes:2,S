These metrics have been useless from the very beginning and are
not very descriptive. If you like to get some meaning in
your statistice, use vmstat. This is more costly, but actually shows
something about the performance of your system.
Maybe we could concentrate on exporting these metrics instead buffer/cache
and provide dummy metrics for them. At least "buffer" can be made to
sth. like "shared" does now.
