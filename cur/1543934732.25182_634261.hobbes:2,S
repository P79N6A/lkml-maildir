On x86-64 there's a bug [*], that causes hackbench to segfault when
compiled with optimizations:
in reap_worker():
    int status;
...
    pthread_join(id, (void **)(void *)&status);
That is not correct, sizeof(void*) > sizeof(int) on x86-64.
Something gets overwritten on the stack, I tried with gcc
-fstack-protector, but it doesn't detect it !?
After applying the patch, it no longer segfaults.
This patch fixes it:

I also notice that the thread version is slower, than process version:
