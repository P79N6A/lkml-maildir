i dont see how blaming autotools for other people's misuse is relevant ... 
this same exact claim could be made for just about any other build system, 
simply apply 's/autotools/$some_build_system_you_wish_to_complain/'.

a libtool bug that has been fixed upstream and is trivial to work around ... 
you could also point out that libtool will also search for a C++ compiler in 
a C-only project.  the libtool stuff can probably be easily cleaned out from 
util-linux completely thus negating this whole topic.

no idea what this rant is about.

history shows this is a pita to maintain.  every package has its own build 
system and configuration file which means you have to go through the 
documentation and figure out the magic incantation to get the thing to build 
up the way you need.

this looks like a no brainer to me: dont edit generated files
