Normally fcntl() locking is a cache coherency point for NFS. However
in 2.2.x the cache isn't invalidated after a fcntl() lock if the
partition was mounted with the "nolock" option.
This recently came up on the debian development mailing list,
in a thread about mail loss over NFS and 2.2 kernels. A patch
was posted, originally by Olaf Kirch, and this should probably go
into 2.2.13.
Note that the same problem exist in the current 2.3.15 kernel.
