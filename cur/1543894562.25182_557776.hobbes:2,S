How is a signing key part of the "preferred form for modification"? It isn't a 
requirement to *modify* anything, just to *replace* something. (And I am 
*NOT* going to explain why "replace != modify" again)

I can find no such requirement in the GPLv2. In fact, it actually says that 
you don't even have to be able to *USE* the program. See section 12 of the 
GPL if you don't believe me.

In light of the d-link case, I'm pretty certain that the German Courts 
interpretation of the GPLv2 makes "Tivoization" a violation. In the US I can 
say that the result would be "GPLv2 does not disallow tivoization". As I've 
pointed out in other posts, the GPLv2 actually *limits* itself to three 
specific "activities". Whether it was intended to "incidentally" cover other 
things or not, it does *clearly* state what it's scope is. If that scope *IS* 
*NOT* the intent of the person and/or person who authored the license, that 
text *SHOULD* *NOT* exist.
