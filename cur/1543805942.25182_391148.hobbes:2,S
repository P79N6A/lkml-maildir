Could we get description of what you are really trying to achieve?
I don't know what "critical socket" is, when you are "in emergency",
etc. When I am in emergency, I just dial 112...
[Having enough memory on the send side will not mean you'll be able to
send data at TCP layer.]
You seem to have some rather strange needs, that are maybe best served
by s/GFP_KERNEL/GFP_ATOMIC/ in network layer; but we can't / don't
want to do that in vanilla kernel -- your case is too specialized for
that. (Ouch and it does not work anyway without rewriting network
stack...)
