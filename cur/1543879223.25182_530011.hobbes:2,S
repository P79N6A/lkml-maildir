Unfortunately, the aio_dio_bugs test in autotest has bug in it :-(
We need stress test the "test code".
on stock 2.6.21-rc6 kernel:
[rock-me-baby]$ cd autotest/tests/aio_dio_bugs/src
[rock-me-baby]$ make
[rock-me-baby]$ ./aio-free-ring-with-bogus-nr-pages
aio-free-ring-with-bogus-nr-pages: Error: io_setup returned -22,
expected -ENOMEM
hmm???  The problem is that the test code forgot to initialized ctx
variable and in the kernel, sys_io_setup returns EINVAL if user
address contain none-zero value.
I will submit the following patch to autotest to correct the test code.
