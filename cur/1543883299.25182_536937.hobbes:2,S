So the CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS=y case is broken,
but the CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS=n below is okay?
Not immediately clear why both cases can't fail.
Maybe Venki can explain.
-Len
static void acpi_propagate_timer_broadcast(struct acpi_processor *pr)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
        unsigned long reason;
        reason = pr->power.timer_broadcast_on_state < INT_MAX ?
                CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_ON : CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_OFF;
        clockevents_notify(reason, &pr->id);
#else
        cpumask_t mask = cpumask_of_cpu(pr->id);
        if (pr->power.timer_broadcast_on_state < INT_MAX)
                on_each_cpu(switch_APIC_timer_to_ipi, &mask, 1, 1);
        else
                on_each_cpu(switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer, &mask, 1, 1);
#endif
