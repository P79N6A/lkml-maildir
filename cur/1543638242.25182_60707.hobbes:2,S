 The mode is supposed to emulate an 8086 which doesn't have the flag. 
Everything else that is available in the mode is a pure implementation
property -- disabling the logic involved is simply not justified by any
means.  Any "real mode" code that operates on the AC flag must have been
created after i386 was released as it requires 32-bit instructions.  Hence
it has to be prepared to deal with the vm86 mode. 
 The AC flag doesn't work unless the AM flag is set in cr0 anyway, so
full real mode compatibility may be implemented in software here if
desired.
