No ;)
My DMA controller has very little in common with ISA DMA one. But I'd like to
use it in a driver. This driver can do DMA but with the help of an external DMA
controller. It's only implement the "slave" side. So basically this driver needs
to configure one of the DMAC channels before transfering data.
What other API could I use in this case ? I don't think the DMA-mapping can
help in this case...
Thanks
