It would work if 1. you used 2.0.36+ (*not* 2.2) or 2. you had a unfsd
server (not sure about knfsd though, so this could become "if you have a
linux server").
It's as simple as this: NFSv2 doesn't know about named pipes and people
have hacked their way around this limitation. It just happens that linux
chose a different hack than everybody else.
I had at some point a patch for 2.1.something which made linux use
char<255,255> as the NFSv2 encoding for a named pipe. I'll see if I can
get it to work with 2.2, but it'll have to wait until tonight when I get
back home. :)
