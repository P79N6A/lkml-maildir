It would be better to use $(LINUXINCLUDE) as we then pull in all config
symbols too and do not have to hardcode kbuild internal names (include2).
As for the use of KBUILD_CPPFLAGS at present the usage is not consistent
across the architectures. Why does arm for example say:
KBUILD_CPPFLAGS       += -mbig-endian
This looks like a KBUILD_CFLAGS thing to me.
So we should preferably stick with LINUXINCLUDE for now.
