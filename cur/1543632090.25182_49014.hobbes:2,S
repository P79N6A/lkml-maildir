I can't judge about this, my judgement comes from how he treats the RTAI
developer.

GPL is not the only free software license.

It's about "free speech" not "free beer".

1. We are talking about a free software project here!
2. They asked a lawyer, here is the result:
   
http://lwn.net/2002/0131/a/rtai-24.1.8.php3
So according to this legal advice, normal application running under
RTLinux/RTAI are not infringing the patent and therefore need no license.
Victor now seems to see things different: "it would still not be permitted
to link binary modules into the derived program without our
permission.  RTAI "user space"  to me, does not escape this issue."
Such statements are what creates the uncertainty and Victor does nothing
to resolve this issue.
That RTAI can be used in a commercial or even closed source environment
doesn't matter here. I'm not happy about the binary module situation
either, but you have to take that to Linus. Whatever is allowed in user
space is clearly defined by the kernel license.
The RTAI developer have the right to use their work however they wish,
should there be a copyright problem, it should be correctly labeled as
such and definitely doesn't need a patent license.
bye, Roman
