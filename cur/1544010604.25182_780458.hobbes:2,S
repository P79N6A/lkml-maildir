The patch is not in Linus's tree yet, right?  That is a requirement to
go into the -stable releases.
Also, it is not exactly obvious why a change for idr is needed.  The
"new" drm code in Fedora releases is understandable, but that is not
code that is in the main 2.6.27-stable tree, right?
Also, please cc: the stable developers if you want them to pay attention
to messages like this.
