I'm following the discussion with interest.  Some hardware (eg
Mellanox HCAs) has the ability to use these hooks to avoid pinning
pages at all, but in general IB and iWARP need to pin pages so the
mapping doesn't change.

This sort of monkeying around with the VM from driver code seems much
more complicated than letting userspace handle it.
