Hi!
I only tried reading the diffs, but:
arch/i386/oprofile/nmi_int.c must be suspended before
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c is.
How is that guaranteed with new code?
-static struct device device_nmi = {
-       .name   = "oprofile",
-       .bus_id = "oprofile",
-       .driver = &nmi_driver,
-       .parent = &device_lapic.dev,
+static struct sys_device device_oprofile = {
+       .id     = 0,
+       .cls    = &oprofile_sysclass,
 };
