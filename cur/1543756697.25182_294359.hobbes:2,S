Ok, I'm quite convinced it's correct now. The only thing that can make
mapcount go up without the lock on the page without userspace
intervention (and userspace intervention would make it an undefined
behaviour like in my example with fork), was the swapin, and you covered
it by moving the unlock after page_add_anon_rmap (so mapcount changes
atomically with the page_swapcount there too). Swapoff was already doing
it under the page lock.
Then we should use the mapcount/swapcount in remove_exclusive_swap_page
too.
