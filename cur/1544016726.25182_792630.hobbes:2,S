 LOCK dates back to the 8086 -- it has to work with the i386.  What is not 
supported are the following i486 additions: CMPXCHG (amusingly enough 
early i486 steppings used a different opcode for this one; no idea if it 
is still possible to find such a CPU), XADD and BSWAP, the latter being 
fairly unimportant.

 UP emulation of CMPXCHG and XADD for userland should be rather trivial, 
so why not include it like with LL/SC for MIPS?
