The dependency of SUSPEND_SMP on HOTPLUG_CPU is quite unintuitive, so 
what about something like the patch below?
This should address a main issue behind Len's patch.
cu
Adrian
<--  snip  -->
An implementation detail of the suspend code that is not intuitive for 
the user is the HOTPLUG_CPU dependency of SOFTWARE_SUSPEND if SMP.
This patch changes SOFTWARE_SUSPEND if SMP to select HOTPLUG_CPU instead 
of depending on it.
