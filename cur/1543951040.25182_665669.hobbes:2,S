So, is this going to be fully reverted, or is it worth pointing out/fixing
other issues? The thing I'm recognizing right now is that
eee3af4a2c83a97fff107ddc445d9df6fded9ce4 made the writes to
DebugCtlMSR unconditional, which means any attempt to do
debugging on i[345]86 will ultimately cause the kernel to oops. All of
that stuff should really depend on CONFIG_X86_DEBUGCTLMSR...
