Ok, tweaking libusb to queue N URBs for reads to be split (resulting in 9 URBs
in my usecase) I see a nearly 100% improvement here (2 times faster).
How many URBs may I queue? Nearly infinite (in my case that would be max 64)
or is there some tiny static list somewhere in the affected code-path?
Yours,
