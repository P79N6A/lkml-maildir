	thanks that did the trick. 
One further question, on the later kernels 2.6.17+, I don't have low_latency 
set. Can I still guarantee that after calling tty_flip_buffer_push() I have 
made space in the tty for my buffer? For example, is this legal? 
// in interrupt handler
   if(tty_buffer_request_room(tty, size) < size) {
      spin_unlock(&dc->lock);
      spin_unlock(&port->lock);
      tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
      spin_lock(&port->lock);
      spin_lock(&dc->lock);
  }
  tty_insert_flip_string(tty, buf, size);
   
Thanks
Andrew
