My attitude to this is simple: who cares about proprietary modules?
The current test is wrong, it should be checking for forced module loads 
(which may not have marker information and may well crash the kernel).  Of 
course, all forced module loads can crash the kernel, but this is pretty 
certain and it's simply to avoid.
We should just flat-out refuse to load a module with a module section too 
small.  That will cover the majority of this case anyway (*and* the 
non-kallsysms case), and then we can remove this test altogether.
Cheers,
Rusty.
