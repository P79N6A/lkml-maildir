There is no such "deal". Whether Sony is violating the license is a
matter of interpretation of the boundary lines that in law define a
"derived work". Nothing else.
Many of the Linux kernel copyright holders (including the FSF) are of
opinions that some or indeed all kernel modules are derivative works.
There is currently no directly relevant legal test case to assertain
this reliably.
At the moment the bigger concern however is not legal corner cases but
the huge number of vendors directly violating the GPL.
