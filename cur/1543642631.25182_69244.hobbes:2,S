I recently bought a BAFO BF-810 usb->serial adaptor which also
contained a pl2303 (the driver detects it as one at least). I have
exactly the same behavior as Tony Hoyle. If I use the uhci module,
it'll crash every time (I am using pilot-xfer to backup my palm for
tests). If I change to the usb-uhci driver, it works.
Currently only running 2.4.19pre9. Will try a newer kernel soon. The
driver itself has not changed between 2.4.19pre9 and 2.4.19, though.
(SMP-system).
