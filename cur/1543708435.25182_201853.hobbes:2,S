I was not suggesting that we add drivers or even the middle layer to the 
mainline kernel until there is some use for it.  Rather, it wouldn't be 
a bad idea for someone to DEVELOP it as a patch which could be mainlined 
the moment there became a demand for it.  This also leaves the work in 
the hands of those who should care, because anyone using the middle 
layer has the 'disadvantage' of using a non-standard patch which they 
have to take responsibility for using.
