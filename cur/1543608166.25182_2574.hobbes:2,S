   How is this different from my init_sg proposal? :-). The above looks
   fine to me, I just think it is important that we take care of this.
My impression was that you wanted to do something like:
	sgl = kmalloc();
	init_sg(sgl, nents);
	for_each_ent() {
		... existing code ..
	}
If what you really meant was semantically identicaly to what I have
proposed, I'm completely in agreement with it.  Please submit patches.
Franks a lot,
