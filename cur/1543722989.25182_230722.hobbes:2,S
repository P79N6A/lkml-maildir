I have tested 2.6.7-bk10 plus from_2.6.7_to_staircase_7.7 patch and,
while it's definitively better than previous versions, it still feels a
little jerky when moving windows in X11 wrt to -mm3. Renicing makes it a
little bit smoother, but not as much as -mm3 without renicing.
What it shines on is the fact that the "while true; do a=2; done" loop
has no apparent effect on interactivity, that is, the system feels as
interactive as when not running this CPU hog.
