The patch itself is simple, so this must be an extended interpretation of the

Not at all, the lazy man's way of dealing with this is to disable preemption 
around that code, an efficient operation.

I don't know about that.  From the (long) thread above, it looks like you 
haven't successfully proved the assertion that -preempt introduces any new 
inheritance requirement.

Demonstrated to who?  I have certainly demonstrated the benefits to myself, 
and others have attested to doing the same.
As far as arguments go, your main points don't seem to be rooted in firm 
ground at all.  On the other hand, the proponents of this patch have 
compelling arguments: it makes Linux feel smoother, it makes certain tests 
run faster, it doesn't slow anything down measurably, it's stable and so on.  
I even explained why it does what it does.  I don't understand why you're so 
vehemently opposed to this, especially as it's a config option.
