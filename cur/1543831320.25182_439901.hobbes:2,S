I don't see why the kernel should have to insert compile flags to 
counteract any random non-default compile flags that the system may 
decide to insert. I think the way Ubuntu has done this is broken, they 
are essentially changing the default settings on the compiler in a way 
which breaks the kernel due to needing external libraries.
