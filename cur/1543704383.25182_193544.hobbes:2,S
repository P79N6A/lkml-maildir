I see no evidence that this is an agpgart problem.  When that does something
wrong, you usually end up with either a system lockup, or massive memory
corruption. Apps segfaulting would suggest to me that you have a problem with
your X GL libraries.
You may have more luck asking the folks at dri-devel@lists.sf.net about it.
