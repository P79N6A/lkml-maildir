Is there anything like that?  I'm not aware of any structure that keeps
track of general "buses", which would be what we want.  Something that
keeps track of PCI buses, Infiniband buses, arch-specific fabric buses,
etc.  Barring the existence of such a structure, I'll just shove it in
the PCI bus structure for now.
