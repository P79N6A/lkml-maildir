Subject: [PATCH 2.4] I2C updates for 2.4.29 (3/3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Bottom line:
The "id" member of the i2c_client structure was discarded in Linux 2.6
due to a lack of consistent use and overall need. While we of course
won't backport this to Linux 2.4 so as to not break compatibility with
existing 2.4 drivers, it still seems wise to update the documentation so
that new drivers written for Linux 2.4 today (*sigh*) do not rely on it.

 For now, you can ignore the `flags' parameter. It is there for future use.
