Alan,
I think the soak time for 2.4 will probably continue past this since
there's still tons of stuff still pending (including me getting my code
tuned).  I've been working on auto-repair from the driver so the FS can
auto repair itself just like NetWare does when it mounts volumes.  The
biggest issue is that 2.4 still needs Linus and you to get everyone out
of the code for a couple of months, and you guys do some performance
tuning work without it chaning beneath you.  6 weeks is very agressive. 
I think you could make this date, but the performance work still will
need to get done, and I don't see how with all the stuff going on how
you guys will get this done in 6 weeks.  To date 2.4 is still noticeably
slower than the 2.2 tree in some areas and overall, at least from what
we are seeing, but this is just IMHO.
