GFP_DMA allocations should return memory under 16Mb or NULL. Nothing has 
changed there. The sound code checks the virtual address however and not
physical so if the simple page mapping rule no longer applies the check
will backfire (as will a lot of others). That - if its the problem is
easily fixable
