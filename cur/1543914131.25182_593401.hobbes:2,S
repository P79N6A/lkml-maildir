If it had been a signed type, it could've wrapped to something you didn't 
expect, explaining the difference at least...
With an unsigned long, the only diference should be that time_after() deals 
with jiffie wrapping which I assume is not an actual problem here. I'll 
retreat into the shades again... ;-(
