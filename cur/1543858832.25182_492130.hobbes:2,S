note that the above examples i listed were just a *few* of the
examples that didn't match the most common variants:
  sizeof(fubar) / sizeof(fubar[0])
  sizeof(fubar) / sizeof(*fubar)
i just did that to show that, even if i can run a script to handle the
most common variants, there would be lots of manual cleanup left.

in fact, i just emailed a short CodingStyle note to randy dunlap
(since he seemed to be heavily into the coding style stuff),
suggesting that a short note be added strongly recommending that one
should use ARRAY_SIZE wherever possible and, if not possible, a
comment should be added explaining why not, if it seems to be useful.

true enough, but if the most common variants can be handled
automatically, then the remainder would stand out more obviously and
could be manually handled from there.

i'm actually in the process of trying that as we speak, at least with
the automatic cleanup.  there's no way i'm going to try to get into
manual cleanup with all of those weird variants.  life's too short for
that.  :-)
