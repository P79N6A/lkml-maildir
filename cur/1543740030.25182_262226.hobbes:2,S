I like this later option... How may archs actually had autoprobing
implemented and actually used ?
Well, I'll do some grep'ing around tonight as I do the NO_IRQ stuff
and see what makes more sense. I don't think an arch that didn't have
autoprobing needs it now, besides, it's not exactly a reliable
mecanism...
