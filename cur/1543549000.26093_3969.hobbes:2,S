I think its the D815EEA Board (its not right here at the moment)
and it says it has the "Intergrated Intel Pro/100V Network Connection
Whats the Diff between the i82557/558/559 boards and this i82865 one?
Maybe if I edit the eepro100 driver to allow the ID this card is on it might
work (or maybe not)!
# grep 1227 /usr/src/linux/drivers/pci/pci.ids
1227  Tech-Source
        1227  82865 [Ether Express Pro 100]
But the eepro100 driver doesn't allow for this PCI ID yet (maybe it will
work?) (will try tomorrow)
Thanks
