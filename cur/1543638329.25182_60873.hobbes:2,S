Consider this. An application writes to /dev/dsp0, and ymfpci
(for example) start DMA. Then user interrupts the app with ^C.
When ymfpci gets ->release() call, it has to tell the chip
to stop DMA, then wait until it's complete. If it tries to
wait with TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, schedule() will return immediately,
and in essense do a busy loop with CPU pegged at 100%.
Same thing happens in USB, only there it's worse: a spinning
application locks out khubd and whole subsistem dies.
