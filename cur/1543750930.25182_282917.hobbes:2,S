The less that happens, the less likely it is for anything to happen.
You're effectively arguing that very little should happen.
This cannot be, because pure bugfixing activity alone would overwhelm
the limits on levels of activity you endorse. When it comes to design
flaws, a single fix for such would swamp the limits on activity you've
imposed for a significant portion of a year.
If you want more stability and fewer regressions, look for methods of
getting more peer review for patches, not fewer patches.
