Sorry this is broken.  The code location you are running from when you
perform the switch from one page table to another must be mapped at
the same location in both page tables.  Otherwise it is undefined what
the processor will do.
So you need at least one additional entry in your page table.
The fact that this bug did not jump out is a clear sign you were
changing too many things at once, and did not have an adequate
explanation in your change log.

After the jump is performed?

Actually it doesn't really, because I don't have enough information
to infer which Xen call you are using or why it is sane.  Certainly
Xen does not need struct page * pointers or Xen is too tightly coupled
with linux to be sane.

I assume this is a Xen call with the semantics: 
switch page tables and jump to location X in the new page tables.
I assume Xen is still running at this point?

Except that the memory map in linux is fixed.  The x86_64 kernel will
run with negative addresses and physical addresses will remain
positive until a decade or two from now when we get 64bit physical
addresses.
Unless linux runs with a different memory map when running under Xen.
