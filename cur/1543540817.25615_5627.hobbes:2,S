Greetz linux hackers.
Today I compiled a linux 2.2.16 kernel on a AMD K6.  I only could choose
the realtek 8139 driver ,when I selected Experimental drivers in the
first menu of the "make xconfig" menu.
My question is. Is this driver still experimental?
If not,did I make a mistake?  And if it wasn't my mistake..could this
bug(TM) be removed.
Thanx Martijn Uffing
