} Well, I'm not Linus (thank $DEITY for that; in that case, Linux would've

The problem for getting a stable 2.4.0 out is not with the architectures,
they've been stable mostly.  I'm fighting a tidal wave of changes from the
PPC guys that I can't let into 2.4 or 2.2 since they're both supposed to be
stable.  We have to endure VM rewrites but the architecture-specific code
has been pretty stable.  If we could get a damned 2.4 our then we could
also have a 2.5 and there would be some place for these experimental
changes to go instead of the two stable trees.
I've had to create a 2.5 for the PPC tree so we aren't stuck with either no
experimentation or experimentation in the stable trees.
