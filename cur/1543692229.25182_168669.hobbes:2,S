Is this what we should use to fix the currently broken list traversal[*] in
drivers/scsi/{a2091,gvp11,53c7xx}.c?
Currently ut uses
    struct Scsi_Host *instance;
    for (instance = first_instance; instance &&
	 instance->hostt == xxx_template; instance = instance->next)
bust Scsi_Host.next was removed a while ago...
