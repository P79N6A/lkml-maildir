Xen doesn't need it either.

So why do you want xen use vmi then?

As mentioned there was a proof-of-concept VMI ROM done by vmware.  As
far I know it translated the VMI ROM interface calls into xen hypercalls
somehow, Zach probably has more details.
So in the end you would still have two different hypervisor ABI's, the
VMI ROM just hides that.
