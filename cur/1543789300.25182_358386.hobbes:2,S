Thanks.
For users testing this, could you please also try larger values in: 
/proc/sys/vm/swap_prefetch
Read the current value (it should be in the range of 1-10) and try a value ten 
times larger.
It is currently quite gentle in the amount it prefetches, but the code is now 
extremely cautious about when to prefetch and I suspect it can prefetch much 
more by default, thus intensifying the effect and benefit. 
Cheers,
Con
