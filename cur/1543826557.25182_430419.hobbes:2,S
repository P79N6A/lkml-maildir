It doesn't stop the timer explicitely. It only calls the timer
recalculator function and when all file handles are closed => all
effects are deleted => no events => input_ff_recalculate_timer() stops
the timer.
And IIRC when device is being removed, kernel actually waits for the
file handles to be flush()ed before kfree()ing the input_dev.
But hmm, when device is being removed with effects running, and
input_ff_flush() erases effects and calls input_ff_recalculate_timer(),
that function schedules the timer to run immediately to stop the
effects. Therefore we would have a race condition: without locking
dev->ff could be deleted while input_ff_timer() is still running.
That is the reason why del_timer_sync() is in input_dev_release(), to
make sure the input_ff_timer() is no longer running.
