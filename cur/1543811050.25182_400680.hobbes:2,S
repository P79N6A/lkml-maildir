[just speculation, haven't examined the code in detail]
One credible theory also was that the keyboard or console driver does too much
work in workqueues, which need the scheduler and scheduling doesn't work anymore
after panic. I remember hacking around a problem with this long ago on 2.4
The hack was to just check after_panic and call the function directly.
