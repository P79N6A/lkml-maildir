Which filesystems have limits other than 2^31 bytes?
I ask this because I was looking at LFS compliance and the way we
currently do things now isn't very smart. Only ext2 checks of
O_LARGEFILE at present (well, their is perhaps good reason for this
as it is one of the fre that supports multiGB files) whereas I think
this check should be done in the VFS.
