Subject: PID of init != 1 when initrd with pivot_root

Well, I upgraded and found pivot_root and the problem is that how do I make init
run with PID 1. My linuxrc gets PID 7.
    1 ?        00:03:05 swapper
    2 ?        00:00:00 keventd
    3 ?        00:00:00 kswapd
    4 ?        00:00:00 kreclaimd
    5 ?        00:00:00 bdflush
    6 ?        00:00:00 kupdated
    7 ?        00:00:00 linuxrc
init doesn't like running with any other PID than 1. I could probably revert to
the not so old way of doing things and exit linuxrc and let the kernel change
root. But then I wouldn't be able to mount root over samba :-(. ( not that I
have any samba shares :-)
