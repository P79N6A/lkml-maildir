Eric Youngdale has already done most of the work needed for this. Im currently
brutalising his code and attempting to find an SMP lockup. He has driver
specific queues working, the SCSI layer way cleaner (its still uggggly but
its a lot _less_ ugly that it was before)
Once the SMP problems are found and I've run it over a few more controllers
I will send it on to Linus
