So in the example I gave, a read after the spin_unlock() may actually get
executed before the store in the spin_unlock(), but a read before the unlock
will not get executed after.

Well, I think you mean will guarantee absolutely _nothing_ on the other CPU for
the Linux kernel.  According to the IBM powerpc book I have, it does actually
do something on the other CPUs, though it doesn't say exactly what.
Anyway, thanks.
I'll write up some documentation on barriers for inclusion in the kernel.
