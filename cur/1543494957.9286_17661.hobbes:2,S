For my playing they dont. I can demonstrate that for a listening socket
the worst case is we take a wake of all for some weird cases. At least
to my satisfaction, and providing I ignore select on listening for testing
cases. I broke select and have an if(port==80) type check for wake one - its
ugly OK ...
Linus theory btw doesnt work either.

Unfortunately you also need to consider a common case where another task
POSIXly requires waking. The classic is select(). Such tasks should always
be woken.
You need to be a bit smarter thats all. wake_one must wake the first
sleeping  (that is important - a task on the wait queue already running being
woken alone raises all sorts of funky races) wake_one mode task and anyone 
who is 'wake my always'.
Not much more complex. With a very scalable system it would be good to keep
a count of tasks in wake all to avoid an O(n) list walk for the non select
cases.
