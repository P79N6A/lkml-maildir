Subject: [PATCH 0/3] proc: bye bye tasklist_lock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

fs/proc/ does not use tasklist_lock anymore.
These patches are simple enough and do not depend on each other.
The only problem I don't know how to really test them.
Can anybody recommend a stress-test?
Oleg.
