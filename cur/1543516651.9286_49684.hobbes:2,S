Erm.... What about SMP machines? Are you going to get rid of them?
The purpose of the lock prefix is not to make the current CPU operation
atomic. It's to make all other CPUs halt until the operation is complete.
This gurantees that only one CPU modifies the variable at the same
time. You are not going to do that with a move.
