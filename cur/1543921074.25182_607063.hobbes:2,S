Note that a USB drive is treated as a SCSI device.
With the original code, I see the following sequence of events when 
add_disk() is first called.  Values in parentheses are 
atomic_read(disk->dev.kobj.kref.refcount) after each stage runs:
	Entry to add_disk		(1)
	Call to register_disk
	device_add			(3)
	CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED is not set
	Call disk_sysfs_add_subdirs
	add disk->holder_dir		(4)
	add disk->slave_dir		(5)
	Return to register_disk
	get_capacity			(5)
	bdget_disk			(5)
	blkdev_get (partitions)		(8)
	blkdev_put			(7)
	Return to add_disk
	blk_register_queue		(9)
You can see how many references each stage takes.  Now here's the
equivalent list for del_gendisk():
	Entry to del_gendisk		(9)
	invalidate_ and delete_partition loop	(7)
	invalidate_partition 0		(7)
	Call unlink_gendisk
	blk_unregister_queue		(5)
	Return to del_gendisk
	unregister disk->holder_dir	(4)
	unregister disk->slave_dir	(3)
	CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED is not set
	device_del			(1)
	put_device			(0) -- oops!
Matching things up we have:
	device_add/device_del		2 refs
	reg/unreg subdirs		2 refs
	subpartitions			2 refs
	reg/unreg block queue		2 refs
This accounts for everything in del_gendisk except the final
put_device.  Evidently it doesn't belong there.  There's no matching 
get_device in add_disk or register_disk.
