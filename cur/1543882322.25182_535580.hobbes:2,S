Right. Summary: adding maintainer info to source code and/or
compiled modules doesn't seem to make any sense.

Yep. But it's really easy to miss something in lkml and/or in
more specific lists, and the Bugzilla isn't email. That means
we need a WWW-browseable database, with:
a) maintainers registrations with a simple email verification or
   something like that
b) possibility for registered people to declare they now maintain
   (or not) specific portions of the kernel
c) possibility for anyone to retrieve this information.
Other options?
