Hello
I have a kernel module ftape, which won't compile under kernel 2.2
That's a bit sad, because I waited for kernel 2.2 because of it's
parport.o driver, which is needed by ftape.
The problem is in a kernel structure task_struct which has lost its member
"timeout" in the new kernel.
I compared the old kernel headers with the new and there can be clearly
seen that timeout member was removed, while it's neibourghs like cutime
were left in place :(
Ftape depends on that structure member which it gets by current->timeout
and therfor refuses to compile under the new kernel.
Can you please explain me the reason that timeout was removed ? or maybe
it is a bug ?
Thanx in advance...
