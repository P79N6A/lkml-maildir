The guy you qualify as ideolog has promoted things that _really_ exist and 
are used and useable nowadays. Could it be possible he just is a pragmatic 
ideolog ? ;-)
So was probably Linus and perhaps you at the beginning of the Linux
project. But time may have cleared part of your memory.

You are just mixing pragmatism and busyness here, in my opinion. You must 
be pragmatic, may-be, if you want to succeed with $$-busyness, but you 
also can be pragmatic in a more general way. For example, I donnot 
think than projects like Plan-9 that looks like sci-fi that will never 
happen has something to do with pragmatism.

You seem to speak as some representant of the whole Linux community.
Did I miss some election you won or perhaps what you call 'Linux
community' is very different from what I understand from.

And perhaps to kill everybody that are against what you want to save, if
needed.
