Ignoring the ARM side of things for a sec, handle_simple_irq() will
mask() the interrupt in the special case that an interrupt is already in
the processes of being handled.. handle_simple_irq() also unmasks when
it finishes handling an interrupt (something real time adds for some
reason) ..
In terms of threading the irq everything is the same except there is no
unmask() call when the thread finishes ..
