How can it *not* be that simple?
No matter if you think bcopy should work for overlapping memory or not,  
there is a replacement standard function (by the 1989 ANSI C standard, so  
maybe the 1980's are not quite modern enough) that does exactly that, with  
nothing but rearranged parameters.
That's a purely mechanical change, on the same level as the kernel janitor  
stuff - hell, easier than the kernel janitor stuff.
I expect the reason it hasn't been done in Irix kernel code is simly that  
there was no real need to do it. I certainly do not imagine there's  
anything *hard* about it.
Hell, you could just use the #define method to map an XFS memcpy (or  
memmove) onto the Irix kernel library bcopy!
No, this is politics, not technical. (On both sides, of course.)
