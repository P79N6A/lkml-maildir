Could you try it in "pb" mode with both max_ia_bonus and max_tpt_bonus 
set to zero?  That will disable all "priority" fiddling and tasks should 
just round robin at a priority determined solely by their "nice" value 
and since (according to your earlier mail) all the daemons have the same 
"nice" value they should just round robin with each other.
Thanks
Peter
