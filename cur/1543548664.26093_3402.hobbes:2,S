Ehmm... that large queue is a backlog of I/O requests. Since that's a
function of the workload and the disk speed, you can't reduce it without
either cutting the workload or speeding up the disk!
I suspect we were talking at cross purposes here a little. I was NOT
suggesting holding back requests to build up a big queue - I was talking
about the situation where we have a large backlog of requests pending.
