Last working kernel was the 2.6.22 without cfs. With the patch applied 
it shows the same problem (And so it does with the 2.6.23 as cfs was 
merged). And its caused by the cfs(-patch).
And the real problem is not just restricted to konqueror. Its just 
easier to reproduce. (So the original mails started at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/14/60
 )
