In fact, I like the idea. But passing nfsroot=xxx to kernel doesn't
imply "ip=on" is very annoying. My setup worked fine with 2.4.4. It
took me a while to figure out why it didn't work with 2.4.4-ac8.

I don't think we have total control over how to boot over network on
all platforms. On some platforms, you may only load kernel over the
network and run from it.
