Ack.  I got a little confused.  I was still thinking of what
the identity mapping was trying to achieve, and you don't achieve
the same thing.

In the general case which you want to cover page_table_a is still
slightly wrong.  In particular you can theoretically get a conflict
between the virtual address of your page table switching function and
the physical address of the control code page.
However while I agree that you need to do this in assembly for
control I disagree that this code should be part of the
relocate_new_kernel function.
Please move the code that uses page_table_a to a separate function,
that when it is done jumps to the control_code page.  Then you can
map this page both virtually and physically with a statically
allocated page table built a compile time.
This is a little simpler as you don't need to build this first
page table dynamically and a little clearer as you aren't trying to
get the control code page to serve two different functions.
If this function was more than 3 lines of assembly it could even
be written in C for clarity with a special section so that
the linker would not map it twice.  Of course that would still need
to address the stack usage problem.

Testing is important here.  But given that 99% of the bug hunting must
be done via code review and thinking about the problem testing is not
sufficient.
