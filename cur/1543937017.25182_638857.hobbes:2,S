Metaclustering is being discussed on LKML in some other threads, here is the latest patch against the 2.6.23.13 stable kernel, any help in testing and evaluating this will be greatly appreciated! While I'd direct anyone interested in details of metaclustering to other LKML threads discussing it, I've enclosed a brief description here:

Cool!
Sounds like this should also make unlink of large files faster too, 
which is a much more saleable win.  At Digeo we always had the problem 
that deleting a multi-GB PVR file would thrash the disk to death and 
give everyone else ~0 throughput.
