Thanks a lot for pointing us to your (last night's) patches, Andrea.

Flawed in what way?  They handled mremap fine, but yes, used pte_chains
for that extraordinary case, just as pte_chains were used for nonlinear.
With pte_chains gone (hurrah! though nonlinear handling yet to come),
as you know, I've already suggested a better way to handle that case
(use tmpfs-style backing object).

You're paying too much attention to the (almost optional, though it can
have a devastating effect on vma usage, yes) issue of vma merging, but
what about the (mandatory) vma splitting?  I see no sign of the tiresome
code I said you'd need for anonvma rather than anonmm, walking the pages
updating as.vma whenever vma changes e.g. when mprotecting or munmapping
some pages in the middle of a vma.  Surely move_vma_start is not enough?
That's what led me to choose anonmm, which seems a lot simpler: the real
argument for anonvma is that it saves a find_vma per pte in try_to_unmap
(page_referenced doesn't need it): a good saving, but is it worth the
complication of the faster paths?
