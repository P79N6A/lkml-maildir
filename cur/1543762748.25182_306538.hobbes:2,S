FWIW, I agree with Jean.
Applying these patches without adequate review is like applying __iomem
or __user fixes where they've been generated with the aim of shutting up
sparse, rather than considering whether the warning is actually valid.
Once the warning is gone, the real problem is lost and never gets looked
at.
