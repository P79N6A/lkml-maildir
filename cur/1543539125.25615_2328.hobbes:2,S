Dear all,
 I'm new on this list and I hope my question hasn't been too often asked
here (although I found nothing about it in the archive).
On the 2.2.16 kernel, I could choose "IP; kernel level
autoconfiguration" and then choose "DHCP", "BOOTP" or "ARP". I made
successfull experiments with BOOTP and DHCP but the latter brought very
interesting things to my work.
I tried the 2.3 and 2.4 kernels, but this feature seems to have
disapear.
Does anyone know why or knows if DHCP autoconfiguration is abandonned
forever.
Thanks in advance.
Alexandre.
