I have a
  
http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2893289&CatId=464
uses mos7720 chip.
they have a linux driver on the site but it wont work on newer 2.6 kernels it uses SLAB_ATOMIC etc. needs updating.
 The 2.6 kernel has this driver and i have seen some activity 6 months ago on it but nothing recent. 
This driver for me does not work when i try to cat /dev/ttyUSB2
it fails and when i try to run
statserial /dev/ttyUSB2 
statserial: TIOCMGET failed: Invalid argument
 debugging seems to get me a bit lost one thing i notice is that the interrupt handeler never gets turned off. Other serial usb modules do remove the interrupt on close. 
Was hoping someone had this hardware and had tested to see if it is just me.
