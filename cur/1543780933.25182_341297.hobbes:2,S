Hi there,
I found an older patch in the Linux Kernel Archive which enables mounting an
USB-Device as root filesystem.
This patch fixes something which I think of as a longstanding bug in the
vanilla Linux Kernel source!
Unfortunately this bug has not been fixed in the current Kernel release and
the blkdev_wakeup.patch which can be found on
http://www.dedasys.com/freesoftware/patches/blkdev_wakeup.patch
 does not
work anymore.
What am I supposed to change in the code to make this work again?
Looking at usb.h scsi_scan_done has been removed from us_data :(
Sven
