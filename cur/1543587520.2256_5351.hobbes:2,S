Release 1.1.0: Fri Apr 13 23:10:56 EDT 2001
	* Better-controlled recursivity in the theorem prover; reading in
	  defconfigs is much faster now.
	* Revised config/xconfig/menuconfig/oldconfigs productions, these
	  should be a better match for the expected behavior now.
	* Ternary-select (a ? b : c) added to the language.
Configurator startup is now so much faster it's almost ridiculous.  Wheee!
I added ternary-select to handle some weird cases in the CRIS port
tree for 2.4.4-pre1.

Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there
be one, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of
blindfolded fear.... Do not be frightened from this inquiry from any
fear of its consequences. If it ends in the belief that there is no
God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and
pleasantness you feel in its exercise...
	-- Thomas Jefferson, in a 1787 letter to his nephew
