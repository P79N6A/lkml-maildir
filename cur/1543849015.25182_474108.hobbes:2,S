So, after all this, what I have to report is: Nothing. Building the same
kernel with which I saw the problem (Gentoo's 2.6.17-r8 ebuild) with the
patched gcc 4.1.1 and the kmemleak patches failed to reproduce the
problem. Either those changes perturbed the kernel enough to "fix" the
problem, or my earlier kernel build was some sort of unrepeatable
miscompile.
I noticed one oddness with the 2.6.17 kmemleak patches when built with
the patched gcc. When I had earlier built with gcc-3.4.6
(CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_TRACE_LENGTH=4 and CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=y),
kmemleak reported good information: every entry included four levels of
stack that clearly mapped to addresses described in System.map. That was
not the case when I built with the patched 4.1.1: every entry included
just one level of stack, with an apparently bogus address that didn't
map into the range of addresses in System.map.
So, in the end, a frustrated experiment. I'll be back if I find anything
interesting. Until then, I'm leaving the list, so please include my
address in any followup conversation. Thanks!
