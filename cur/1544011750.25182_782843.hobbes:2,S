Thanks for this Mike, this seems a significant enhancement over the
one in my tree (AFAICT I didn't do ring_buffer.c, nor use on_each_cpu).
I've updated the description, and removed one gratuitous indent change.
It's now in the linux-next section of my tree:
cpumask: convert kernel trace functions
Impact: Reduce future memory usage, use new cpumask API.
(Eventually, cpumask_var_t will be allocated based on nr_cpu_ids, not NR_CPUS).
Convert kernel trace functions to use struct cpumask API:
1) Use cpumask_copy/cpumask_test_cpu/for_each_cpu.
2) Use cpumask_var_t and alloc_cpumask_var/free_cpumask_var everywhere.
3) Use on_each_cpu instead of playing with current->cpus_allowed.
