Subject: ext3 htree brelse problems look to be fixed!

I just booted 2.5-bk current as of last night with the below patch¹
(which was recently posted to ext3-users) that un-static-ifies a 
struct dx_frame in namei.c.
I then did my best torture test for the brelse bug:  starting gnus
(3600+ nnmh folders² with a total of XXX messages; it does a readdir
on each of those folders) while doing bk consistancy checks in 2.5
and/or 2.4 kernel trees.  All while fetchmail+procmail+spamd processes
a stream of incoming mail.
That load had never failed to generate a brelse in the syslog; each
occurance of brelse in the syslog correlated to a short readdir.  In
gnus the short readdir would result in temporarily missing mail; in bk
the consistancy check would fail.  If the bk check was the result of a
pull, a manual bk resync would be required to fix the tree.  (Or one
could remove the RESYNC and PENDING dirs and re-pull.)
The bug did not occur during the torture test.  Even with three bk
checks in parallel (2.5 current, 2.4 current and a clone of a clone of
2.5 as of yesterday.)
I beleive (with this patch) htree is now ready for prime time.
