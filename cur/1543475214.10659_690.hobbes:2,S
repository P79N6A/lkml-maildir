From the point of view of the software developer, there's more variation
across major >>versions<< of redhat and debian linux than there is between
them.  [Also, they both use a variety of gnu packages -- especially in
their core, and to some degree they use sources prepared by the other.]
Also, we really need to take this to another list.  A libc development
list, for example, would probably be more appropriate.
