As a side note, I would just like to point out that Mathematica does not
deal with modular arithmetic by default (which programmers very much do).
In fact, in modular arithmetic, zero IS a power of two.
2^n = 0 (mod 2^n)
To see if it holds for bytes, substitute n = 8, and you get 2^8 = 0 (mod
256). In other words: Zero is the eighth power of two modulo 256.
Modular arithmetic is, however, very often a source of errors in
programming (unchecked-for overflows and underflows), and it is
questionable whether the programmer would really want 0 reported as a
power of two.
