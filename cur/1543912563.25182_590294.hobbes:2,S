This is a rebased version for making ZONE_MOVABLE configurable.
[1/2] .... clean up. this changes ZONE_xxx definitions and helps avoiding
           too many CONFIG_ZONE_xxx usage.
[2/2] .... make ZONE_MOVABLE configurable.
This patch set is against 2.6.23-rc3-mm1. tested on i386/UP and ia64/NUMA
If I should wait for a while (until vm setteled down), I'll wait.
Regards,
-Kame
