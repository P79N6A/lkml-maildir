Thank you very much for your advice.
I tested your suggestion and run the machine without NFS-mounted devices - it 
seems to be working fine. 
Anyway - I'm wondering why I didn't get any problem until 2.4.4ac10 with this 
configuration without the appropriate patch on the client or on the server?
I'm a little bit confused now about this patch.
Do I need this knfsd-patch for the NFS-server or just for the clients or for 
both?
Thank you for your advice,
Andreas Hartmann
