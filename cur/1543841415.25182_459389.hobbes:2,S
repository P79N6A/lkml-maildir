Hi,
I have 2 Linux boxes. 1 running RHEL 3,  2.4.21 kernel. Other SLSE 9, 2.6.5 kernel. 
While porting an C++ application from RHEL to SLES we faced some issue and it was resolved when we imported libstdc++.so.5 from RHEL and forced the app to reference this on SLES, rather than glibc (which was different ) in /usr/lib. We only ported 1 library.
In RHEL, gcc was 3.2.3, in SLES it was 3.3.2. 
Is there any risk associated with this?  
Any input is appreciated. 
Thanks
Rajib
