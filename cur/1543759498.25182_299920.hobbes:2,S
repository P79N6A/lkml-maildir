Subject: [PATCH][2.4.30-pre2] fix undefined behaviour in cistpl.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Compiling drivers/pcmcia/cistpl.c with gcc-4.0 generates this warning:
cistpl.c: In function 'read_cis_mem':
cistpl.c:143: warning: 'sys' is used uninitialized in this function
Note 'is' not 'may be'. And there is indeed a control flow path in
which 'sys' is updated with '+=' even though it has no initial value.
Luckily 'sys' is reassigned later before being used, making this
assignment redundant, so the fix is to simply remove it.
This problem is not present in the 2.6 kernel.
