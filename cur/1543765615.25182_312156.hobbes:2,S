Hmm, I don't have any /dev/twe* here.  I _do_ have hotplug, udev, etc,
installed, and this is a 2.6 machine, so I'm not sure what could be 
wrong.
How recent was this change?

Ok.  Now if only I could find it.  Is there anyplace in sysfs that I
can check manually to see what the dynamic major is?  I'd like to
try creating the device by hand if I can't get Debian hotplug to see
it.
