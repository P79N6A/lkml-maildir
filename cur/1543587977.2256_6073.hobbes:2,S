The kernel actually should allow a misconfigured system to behave as
configured. Basically, your /etc/fstab is telling the kernel that you have
two different devices occupying the same device address. In my case, I
have two cdrom drives. With the original configuration, either one would
mount to /mnt/cdrom. I changed /etc/fstab to identify the first drive as
being at /dev/scd0, mounted to /mnt/cdrom and the second at /dev/scd1,
mounted to /mnt/cd-r. Now I can have to independent drives. I could have
just as easily setup the fstab as above, but  I would not be able to use
both drives.
One cannot expect any program to behave properly when configured
improperly. Your kernel was behaving exactly as it had been programmed it
to.
