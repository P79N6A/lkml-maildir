yep, correct. But you can have TCP_CORK behavior from user-space (by
setting the cork flag in user-space and writing it for all network
output), while you cannot have MSG_MORE in the TCP_CORK case. And a perl
script will likely use none of these mechanizms, it's the webserver CGI
host code that does the network send, perl CGI scripts do not send to the
network directly, they send to a pipe so the CGI host code can have
absolute control over eg. CGI-generated HTTP headers.
