(jogs brain)
When I last looked, we could tell statically whether pointers passed
to kobjsize were to alloc_pages or kmalloc or kmem_cache_alloc just
based on context.
But in some cases, we could actually pass in pointers to static data
structures (eg bits of init_task) and things that were in ROM and
being used for XIP or things that lived outside of the kernel's
address space. SLAB would deal with this kind of affront by checking
page flags and saying "sorry, not mine".
Beating some sense into nommu here is doable, but non-trivial.
Since we're actually fiddling with page flags at this point and
hijacking an arguably less-appropriate bit, I'm strongly tempted to
just use the SLAB bit.
