Hm, I don't know what to say.  It works here for me :)
Anyway, try enabling USB_DEBUG and see if anything interesting happens
in the logs when the mouse dies.
Also, can you create a bug entry in bugzilla.kernel.org for this, so I
can assign it to the USB mouse author/maintainer?  :)
And no, this isn't a "hold 2.6 issue" by any means.  Lots of odd
driver/device interactions never get figured out, especially for cheap
USB hardware...
thanks,
