Thanks for providing the information, we are not able to reproduce this
problem here. Can you pls write a similar fault handler for kprobes as shown
below and get us the log messages.
int fault_probe(struct kprobe *p, struct pt_regs *regs, int trapnr) {
        printk("fault_handler:p->addr=0x%p, eflags=0x%lx\n", p->addr, regs->eflags);
        return 0;
}
Thanks
Prasanna
