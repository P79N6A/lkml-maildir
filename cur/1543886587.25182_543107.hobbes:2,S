Scrollback rarely works as planned, for me.  Overall, a balance must be 
found.
More information is more helpful.  But.
There are downsides to spewing everything possible, upon error.  You 
cause logging to the possibly problematic disk, you push older messages 
out of the printk ring buffer, etc., etc.
