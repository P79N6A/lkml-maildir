Hello all,
      While looking through the block drivers, cpqarray.c/h, smart1,2.h
and the recent cciss.c/h: they were all for the Compaq Smart Array
Controllers. For 2.5.x or possibly prior, could we consolidate them into
one file incorporating all types of controllers or is there reason there
are 3 different files?
Regards,
-Frank
