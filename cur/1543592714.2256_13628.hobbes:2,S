Regarding previous posts i've made on this subject, it turns out that
using a card with this chipset (i assume all cards - i've only tried a
DFE-530TX) will only reset on a cold boot, and are upset when booted to
windows (it causes them to not respond in linux) A cold boot fixes the
problem. I'm not sure if this chipset is able to be reset "on the fly"
but I sure am interested..
