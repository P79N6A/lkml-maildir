Yes. These are nice:
public kernel image ID (also found in System.map)
public boot ID
private boot ID
public system ID (stored where?)
private system ID (stored where?)

The NT boot loader can read the registry. It must do this for i18n

This is quite a mess. It would be nice to have every boot loader
ship with a program to set parameters, wherever they may be stored.
