This is a beginner's bug. It is a common misconception to believe that
because your program is started as root, it will be allowed to switch
to any other uid. People do not always realize that the syscall might
fail (and not on all OSes it seems), resulting in their program still
running with all privileges. I remember having stuffed some
'setuid(getuid())' in some of my programs a long time ago, I don't see
why others would not do the same. I'm not the only dumb person on this
planet :-)
There's an interesting paper about uid transitions here :
  
http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/papers/Hao-Chen-papers/usenix02.pdf
Also, for examples of programs affected till recently, look at the
date on this patch (few weeks ago) :
  
http://ftp.x.org/pub/X11R7.1/patches/xf86dga-1.0.1-setuid.diff
and this one now (few days ago) :
  
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/downloads/xorg-server/xorg-server-1.1.0-setuid-2.patch
Scary, both X servers are affected...
Now it's not hard to find programs still working like this. Googling
"setuid(getuid())" returns several ones like this :
  
http://devel.squid-cache.org/hno/setfilelimit.c
Here, someone proposing to make tcpdump drop privileges :

So I think that while it's bad code in userland, a misunderstood kernel
semantic caught the developpers. We can at least make the kernel help them.
