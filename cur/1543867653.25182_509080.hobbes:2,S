Hi,
It is all I need ! no more 256 routing tables limitation !. But now it is time for me to test it, but i am working on a kernel 2.6.9, do you think it will be good ?
Why do I need so much routing tables? I need more than 500 routing tables because my Linux have to work with 500 VLANs !. Do you think that your patch will be integreted in the Linux kernel or it stays limited at 256?
A very happy kernel noob :)
