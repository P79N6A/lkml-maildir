One final note.  I agree with all the statements of how awkward and 
unnatural the back to front boolean expressions look but I had adopted 
this technique (for myself) as a means of overcoming design shortcomings 
in the C language.  I intend to keep doing it in my private code (as 
it's saved my bacon a number of times) but will conform to Linus's 
standards for any contributions/patches I submit for kernel code (just 
as I would conform for any other person's standards if I were to 
contribute to their work).  In the long run, consistency in a body of 
code greatly enhances its readability.
Peace?
Peter
