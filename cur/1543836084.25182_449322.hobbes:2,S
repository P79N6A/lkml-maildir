We're not actually freeing the page here though.  We _might_ be making it
reclaimable, but we don't know that.  If page reclaim later _does_ reclaim
the page, then ->all_unreclaimable will get cleared then.  A little later,
but if that's enough to make a difference, I suspect we're already rather
doomed.
Also, if rotate_reclaimable_page() returned non-zero we know this page
isn't immediately reclaimable, so the patch shouldn't be clearing
->all_unreclaimable in that case.
And zone->lock is supposed to be irq-safe.  Yes, we're in an interrupt, but
many different interrupt sources will vector into this code - if we take an
interrupt from /dev/sda while serving a /dev/hda interrupt we'll deadlock
here.  File a bug against lockdep ;)

free_pages_bulk() will clear ->all_unreclaimable.  If this really makes a
difference then we're already skating along the raggedy edge.
There is a string of oom-killer patches in -mm from Nick.  I suspect we'll
be in much better shape after those are merged.
