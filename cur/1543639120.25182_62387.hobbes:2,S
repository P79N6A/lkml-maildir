Tough. The above is not part of the O_SYNC spec on any platform and I
have no intention of implementing it.
The sort of thing you would like to do will be possible with O_DIRECT
(which is a design to allow user programs to manage their own
caches). That has yet to be integrated into the standard kernel
though.
Cheers,
