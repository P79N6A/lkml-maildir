On my pc i encounter a strange error:
the pktsetup is started during system start and set my dvd driver to
packet writing mode. then i insert a dvd movie and start xine. and
sometimes xine says that it can't play the dvd. BUT after
stoping/removing the pktsetup from the dvd drive again, xine plays the
dvd movie without problems.
I have no idea were to start! Does anybody encounter a similar error?
Any ideas?
with kind regards
thomas
