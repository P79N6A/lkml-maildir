Also why check current->namespace?  It doesn't hurt to do
get_namespace() even if it's not strictly needed.  And it would
simplify the code.
In fact all uses of current->namespace and check_mnt() could be
eliminated from namespace.c.  The only use of ->namespace would be in
copy_namespace() and exit_namespace().
