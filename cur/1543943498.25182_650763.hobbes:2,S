I thought the adaptor can always remove the mapping by renegotiating 
with the remote side? Even if its dumb then a callback could notify the 
driver that it may be required to tear down the mapping. We then hold the 
pages until we get okay by the driver that the mapping has been removed.
We could also let the unmapping fail if the driver indicates that the 
mapping must stay.
