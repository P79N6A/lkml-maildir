BINGO!  One of these 31 patches may be the guilty party that's playing
tricks with tar's mind.  I'm running 2.6.20.4-rc1 on an older athlon 
xp2800 with a gig of ram.
Amanda has gotten through the estimate phase and is now doing the backup.  
It will fail, out of tape.  Here is an amstatus output as its running 
right now.

----------------
The directory shown on line one of this report actually has:
[root@coyote /]# du -h /GenesAmandaHelper-0.5/
1.6G    /GenesAmandaHelper-0.5/config-bak
1.6G    /GenesAmandaHelper-0.5/
But line one above says its 350850 KB. 351 MB.  That directory and its 
contents have not been touched in at least a week, March 7th TBE and had 
766MB in it the last time I looked.  So a level 3 backup should be a very 
sparsely filled 65k directory list.
Then, looking at line 2, that tree is virtually identical and generally 
contains the same, or a few percentage points more data due to a change in 
the starting point of one of the amanda trees I'm doing external to 
amanda, so it may contain as much as 800MB right now.  As this is an 
active directory, with 20 megs or so new each night, I could believe a 
level 1 being 21MB maybe, certainly no more.  The last level 1 under a 
good kernel was 19MB according to the emails amanda sends me.  But it 
wants to backup 185MB tonight?
Now we are a little closer to finding this problem.  Or should I say this, 
because if I'm booted to either a working 2.6.20* kernel, or to one of the 
4 2.6.21-rc's I've tested, the data returned by a du -h is sane.  The 
figure I pasted in for the line 1 argument above is not, it's nearly 
double the actual size of that particular directory.  So it's conceivable 
that there are 2 problems as this is the first time a du -h has been 
effected too.
In any event, something tickled the monster, and its hungry.  This is a 
full-stop, show-stopper AFAIAC.
I'll cut that patch-2.6.20.4-rc1 in halves, and build 2 more test 
kernels tomorrow to start a bisect if no one has any better idea 
before then.
But its getting sleepy out now.
Thanks all.
