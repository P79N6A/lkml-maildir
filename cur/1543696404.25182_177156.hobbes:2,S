Subject: PCI with SiS: Cannot allocate resource.

Hello,
I tried 2.6.0-test9 kernel on my 3-years old laptop and it seems I have 
exactly the same problems which I had 3 years ago....
There are mainly three of them
- graphics framebuffer mode does not work
- strange messages from the IRQ router
- sound does not work
The problem with my graphic card is a driver, I think. I overcame it once with 
the help of patches from Thomas Winischhofer
(
http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsisvga.shtml
) and I hope I can do this 
again. So we can forget about it. But the two others are more intresting. May 
be they are important for the kernel...
PCI: IRQ 0 for device 0000:00:01.3 doesn't match PIRQ mask - try 
pci=usepirqmask
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 0000:00:01.4
....
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
SIS5513: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:00.1
SIS5513: chipset revision 208
SIS5513: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
SIS5513: SiS630 ATA 66 controller
I did not try to provide these "idebus=xx" and "pci=usepirqmask" yet... I have 
no idea what should I do... May be the kernel is right by complaining?
If I am supposed to have a reduced performance of my HD with 33MHz bus, then I 
am not sure: Linux definitely works much faster with I/O then Windows on my 
laptop.
If I try to load the sound module, I get the following (from 'dmesg'):
unable to register timer device (-16)
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 0000:00:01.4
PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 0000:00:01.6
PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 0000:00:0c.1
AC'97 0:0 does not respond - RESET
AC'97 0:0 does not respond - RESET
AC'97 0:0 does not respond - RESET
Trident4DWaveAudio: probe of 0000:00:01.4 failed with error -5
And this is exactly for the device 0000:00:01.4 the kernel was not able to 
allocate something...
More information in the attached files. I survived without sound (under Linux) 
on my laptop for 3 years, but now I need it! :)
Any help is deeeeeply appreciated!
Thanks a lot in advance!
PS. Please CC me, I am not a kernel hacker...
