For what its worth, this is a D945GNT
It has ICH7 series Video/Sound/Ethernet on board.
The Video works in vesa mode, but not in native mode.
The sound is not recognized.
The ethernet is recognized by some kernels, but does not work.
It has ATA and SATA which both work.
My sound card is a Nvidia 6600, it works fine with 2.6.11.
At the moment I run with a 2.6.11 kernel, an ethernet card and a Soundblaster.
Other than the Onboard hardware not being supported, things work with the
2.6.11 kernel.  this PCI error only occurs with later kernels.
I could play halfsies to determine just when the PCI error starts, but
another responder had noted that he had similar problems after some
'large PCI changes'  (Im sure he mentioned what version they occurred
in, but it would take some searching to find his e-mail)
