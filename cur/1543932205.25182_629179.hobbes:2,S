I went with 15 in mine, I thought it made the code a little more
readable, but I will defer if you think 16 is better.  If you want me
to send the whole series to you, let me know.
I just sent out a series of 4 patches equivalent to your patches 1-4/6
but based on my already unified kprobes.c/h, You may want to check your
handling of restored registers in trampoline_probe_handler which I found
when rebasing yours on top of my cleanups.  Not sure if this is
important, but it was a difference I found.
X86_32:
regs->cs = __KERNEL_CS | get_kernel_rpl();
yours:
regs->cs = __KERNEL_CS;
