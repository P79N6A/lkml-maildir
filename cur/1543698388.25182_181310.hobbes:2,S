Is the oops triggered by reading /proc/bus/pnp/devices a general protection fault?
Once in a while it will produce a different error in userspace.  If so, I'd like
to see the output.

Could you please try this patch (without pnp-patch-1)... It may fix the ESCD
reading problem.  If it doesn't oops when catted, you may want to test it out
with lsescd by Gunther Mayer.

Also just out of curiosity, could I see what the real mode CS and DS are?  I'm
looking for patterns...
So far all of the offenders have a datasegement at 0xf0000.
