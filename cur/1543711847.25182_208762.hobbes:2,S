My fault. I will be more thorough from now on. Thanks for pointing that out.

Most of the objections centered around CONFIG_COMPAT issue. If we have 
to support 32-bit applications on lk 2.4, what is the right way to do it?
Any
helpful suggestions are appreciated.

This interface is only for 32-bit applications. If and when we have 64-bit
apps,
they use a different (new) interface.

May I also respectfully suggest that you don't use any F* or similar words
in
your mails, for the sole reason that our corporate server filters those
mails out.
We had to infer from Christoph's mail that you had responded earlier. We
don't
want to miss your valuable feedback.
Thank you,
Sreenivas
