Subject: swap_dup and swap_free complaints on a swapless (2.6.24.2) system?

Hello,
I have just found this in my logs on my 2.6.24.2
swap_dup: Bad swap file entry 00000067
VM: killing process sh
swap_free: Bad swap file entry 00000067
swap_free: Bad swap file entry 000000a1
The system is, for the time being, without swap and so I found this odd.
Could it be HW related? The box is presently syncing a 500GB raid1 set
in the background and so might be under more stress than usual. Or are
there other explanations for this?
Thanks,
  Rasmus
