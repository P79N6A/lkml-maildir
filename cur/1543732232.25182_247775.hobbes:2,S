Yes, this works.

This is _major_ drawback. The mount shouldn't stop working just because 
you killed a process.

Probably it doesn't; all hangs I've experienced has been with processes
using NCP mount.

So, the ncpfs client is sort of "single-threaded"?

Not good. Are these two alternatives the only ones? Patching the kernel is 
not an option for us; our customers are only using unmodified kernels from 
their distribution or perhaps kernel.org. 
Having unkillable processes are frustrating, but it's probably better than
being able to kill the entire mount by a single SIGKILL. So, if these are
the only options, I guess the unkillable process solution should be
default.

In my opinion, ncpfs should try to emulate POSIX semantics as close as
possible. This means that "strong" should be default, and it should be
possible to remove open files. Even if the Netware server refuses this
operation, why cannot it be simulated by ncpfs? At least this should be
possible to implement by using "silly deletes", as NFS does, but since NCP
is stateful, too me it seems like this shouldn't be necessary.

The glibc 2.3.3 manpage for unlink actually says that EBUSY shouldn't
happen on Linux.
