(1) these issues are independent.  The partition parsing could
be done in user space, today, by blkpg, if I read the code correctly
;-)  (there's an ioctl for [un]registering partitions)  Never
tried it though ;-)
(2) what about bootstrapping?  how do you find the root device?
Do you do "root=/dev/hda/offset=63,limit=1235823"?  Bit nasty.
(3) how does this work for LVM and RAID?
(4) <propaganda>libparted already has a fair bit of partition
scanning code, etc.  Should be trivial to hack it up... That said,
it should be split up into .so modules... 200k is a bit heavy just
for mounting partitions (most of the bulk is file system stuff).
</propaganda>
(5) what happens to /etc/fstab?  User-space ([u]mount?) translates
/dev/hda1 into /dev/hda/offset=63,limit=1235823, and back?
