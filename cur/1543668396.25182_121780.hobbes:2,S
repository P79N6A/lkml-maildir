Subject: [PATCH][2.4] const char* to char* conversion in console.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The read function for consoles in include/linux/console.h contains const 
char* for a pointer that it will actually modify. Although no one seems 
to be using this as of now, it should be corrected.
