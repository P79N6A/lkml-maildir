Not very interesting. It just does the same thing your previous patches 
have done - ignores the cardbus slot for sizing. It just does it 
differently and more explicitly.
Your original patch did it by simply giving the resources invalid 
alignments (in a very non-obvious way). This one does it by being explicit 
and saying "we won't care about cardbus resources behind transparent 
bridges". But it's still a very hacky thing, and thus not really 
interesting at all as a patch.
IOW, it's not a patch that makes sense - it's just a patch that ON YOUR 
PARTICULAR MACHINE causes us to get the layout you want in order to hide 
the bug. And it doesn't really even do anything new - it's just doing the 
same thing in an old way.
But it's interesting that the "don't size _anything_ behind a transparent 
bridge" apparently made no difference for you.
Can you send "lspci -vv" and "dmesg" output for that kernel? Even if it 
failed the suspend/resume, it's interesting, because I would actually have 
expected that one to have the same layout as the successful ones.
