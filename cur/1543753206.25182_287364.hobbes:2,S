I tried 2.6.11rc1, which has modular drm (and also the crash I'm
struggling with.)
# modprobe drm debug=1
# modprobe radeon
I got this in dmesg (some of it also on the console):
[drm] Initialized drm 1.0.0 20040925
[drm:drm_init] 
[drm:drm_probe] 
[drm:drm_probe] assigning minor 0
PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:08.0 (0000 -> 0003)
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:08.0[A] -> GSI 19 (level, low) -> IRQ 19
[drm:drm_ctxbitmap_next] drm_ctxbitmap_next bit : 0
[drm:drm_ctxbitmap_init] drm_ctxbitmap_init : 0
[drm] Initialized radeon 1.11.0 20020828 on minor 0: ATI Technologies Inc 
RV280 [Radeon 9200 SE]
[drm:drm_probe] new minor assigned 0
I guess it was detected as pci, due to the "PCI: Enabling device..." message.
At least there is no mention of AGP here.
I tried to run X on the radeon after this, and it locked up solid as usual.
I hope this helps.  I can try other kernels, but I hope a binary
search will be a last resort. (I will try that if absolutely necessary, 
but it will take time.  I can't reboot all the time.)
