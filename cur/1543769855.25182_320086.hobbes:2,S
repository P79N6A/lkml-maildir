I think so, if we can ensure none is delivered to the partially up cpu
we probably are covered.
Iam not a 100% sure about above either, if the smp_call_function 
is started with 3 cpus initially, and 1 just came up, the counts in 
the smp_call data struct could be set to 3 as a result of the new cpu 
received this broadcast as well, and we might quit earlier in the wait.
sending to only relevant cpus removes that ambiquity.
