Ehh.. One of those readers can hold on to the thing while waiting for
something else to happen.
Looking up a data structure and copying it to user space or similar is
_the_ most common operation for any lookup. You MUST NOT free it just
because we scheduled away. Scheduling points have zero meaning in real
life.
So you'll need a reference count to actually keep such a data structure
alive _over_ a schedule. Or all the readers need to copy the data too
before they actually start using it. At which point you've made your code
a _lot_ slower than the locking version.
Yeah, I can see that your data structure can be made to work by limiting
how you can use it ("you must never hold on to a entry over a schedule,
reference-counting is a no-no, and you have to stand on your left foot
when you look at it sideways").
