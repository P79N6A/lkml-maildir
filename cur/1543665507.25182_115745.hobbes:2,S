I agree the size of glibc 1.1M and /bin/bash 600K are substantial.
And in most cases if I had to drop one it would be /bin/bash.  But 2M
is not that bad if you already need 14M for your modules.   
There are still cases where you need to fit through a very narrow pipe
like a floppy, and for those any extra size is a show stopper.  But I
also don't see needing a lot of flexibility after coming through a
very narrow pipe.

I agree, flexibility is important.  
My basic point was it sounds like the development process is backwards.
It feels like we are starting big and then going small, instead of the
other way around.  
And if starting big keeps the code from being incorporated into
the kernel, I'm not in favor of it.  I am in favor of any code that
works.
How I have always expected to use this code is to either use
what is provided in the kernel or replace it entirely.

I am not surprised.  In kernel and out of the kernel the APIs are noticeably
different.  
There are some things like table parsers that I expect would remain unchanged
moving from kernel to user space.  Using the information would be quite
different but the same data structures could be used to represent it.
The important thing is when people have an itch to move code they can glance
at it and not have to worry about the license.  If something looks hard
at first glance it might not happen.  If it looks easy it more likely to happen
even if it is hard :)

Quite reasonable, and I have no problem with BSD/MIT for just the
library as long as it has a  GPL compatible license.
