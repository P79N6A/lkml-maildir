The skas vs tt distinction is the address space part of this.  How we nullify
system calls is separate.  That's the PTRACE_SYSCALL vs PTRACE_SYSEMU (which
is now in mainline) thing.

Hehe, that would be Blaisorblade - I've refrained from asking what he had
to sacrifice.

skas0 still requires one host process per UML process.  That's how it gets
host address spaces, which skas3 does using /proc/mm.  In this sense, skas0
is sort of a cross between tt and skas3 modes.
