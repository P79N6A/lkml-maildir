Which "ACPI wakeup settings" did you mean?  In BIOS or in kernel?
In my BIOS, there's a page called "Power management" (or something
of that sort), which, among other things, contains a section
"Wakeup devices" or "Wakeup events" - i tried to turn them all
on and off, all at once and in alot of different combinations -
makes no real difference, the system wakes up in a secound or
two regardless.
Too bad no one cares about standby.. :(
I've several of those systems, and I love them for their quiet
operation.  The only problem for me is the system startup time
(about 3 minutes) and applications startup time (due to the
empty filesystem cache) -- it'd be very nice to be able to
suspend the system somehow instead of turning it off...  Now,
suspend to disk does not work at all (that 4M pages stuff on
a VIA C3 CPU), suspend to mem does not work either, and "normal"
standby, while works, triggers a wakeup almost immediately.
So, in short, no suspend at all...
But Ok.  Lemme see what's going on around that file in the code..
