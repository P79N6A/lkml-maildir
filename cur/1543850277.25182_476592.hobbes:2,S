I added it so that these entries will not confuse users of a non-smt/mc
systems. But mixed type of processors and cpu hotplug really complicates the
things..
May be a check of something like "is this platform capable of
supporting any multi-core/multi-threaded processor package?" helps..
As there is no well defined mechanism to find out that and for simplicity
reasons, we should probably go with Tony's suggestion.
Russ I can post a patch, removing both smt_capable() and mc_capable()
checks.
Today this sysfs variable is not documented. But when it happens, we
need to clearly document that these variables have no meaning when
the system doesn't have cpus with threads/cores.
