I can think of an efficiency-related use for MAP_COPY, and it has
nothing to do with shared libraries:
 - An editor using mmap() to read a file.
The existing semantics require that you either call read() and waste
(potentially shared) memory to do this, or use MAP_PRIVATE and then
deliberately page in and dirty all of the file's pages.
Neither of these seem to be the most efficient way to launch an editor.
