I actually had a patch to sparse to _not_ complain about it, because I 
think it's one of the sane C++ extensions. I must have lost the patch and 
not sent it upstream.
So in general, I don't mind the "return void_function()" in a void 
function, I think it makes sense from a type standpoint, and sometimes 
results in cleaner code. That said, I'm also not sure it's worth breaking 
the C standard over, so I don't really mind it being fixed in the kernel 
either (but would certainly also not complain if sparse were to be changed 
to not complain)
