Hey,
I wrote some non-recursive makefiles for the Linux kernel a while
ago but figured no-one really wanted them. Since it seems people
do want them, here you can have it.
I especially designed the setup so that only the toplevel Makefile
and the Rules.make needed to be changed. And it works suprisingly
well. Some directories didn't work perfectly but it should be fine.
The makefile is from 2.2.13-pre13, but I don't think it's changed much
recently.
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
