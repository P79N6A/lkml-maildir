Hello!
I don't know, maybe it's Ok, but it looks confusing - usb-uhci is listed
twice on the same IRQ 9.

In short, all USB stuff is compiled as modules.
# CONFIG_USB_UHCI is not set
CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT=m
# CONFIG_USB_OHCI is not set
It's a brand new VIA motherboard, so I don't know whether the problem
existed in the earlier kernels or not (if it's a problem).
It looks like that the motherboard has two USB controllers:
00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133] (rev 02)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133 AGP]

00:07.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. UHCI USB (rev 10)
00:07.4 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super ACPI] (rev 30)
00:07.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. AC97 Audio Controller (rev 20)
