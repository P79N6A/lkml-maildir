Good.  Let's try to make some forward progress here.  I'd like
to see the patches broken into a sequence something like this:
1) Add new interfaces to header files to support any new API
   needed by new files
2) Create all the new files (plain copies of old files where
   a move is involved).
3) Functional changes to copied files.
4) Whitespace cleanup of copied files.
5) Point Makefiles to new files
6) Delete all the old/unused files.
7) Delete any API in headers that were only used by old files.
We'll need to coordinate with some other maintainrs for
drivers/pci/hotplug/Kconfig and drivers/scsi/qla1280.c,
but I'm ok with running all the other parts through the
ia64 tree.
This follows the usual guidelines of a sequence of steps where
the system is buildable+usable at each stage.
