Sorry for replying from a different account, but it's the best I can
do right now. I know while I was scanning the whole kernel for other
wait_event*() replacements, I thought at least a handful of times,
"ugh, I could replace this whole block of code, except for that lock!"
I will try to get you a more concrete example on Monday. Thanks for
the feedback & patience!
