That check would be wrong anyway. A kernel built with FPU emulation
boots, runs and uses the hardware FPU code correctly. The problem area
is the X86_FEATURE_foo stuff. I think that comes down to a single thing
- if we have FPU disabled clear X86_FEATURE_FXSR|X86_FEATURE_MMX|
X86_FEATURE_SSE* in the boot cpu features during early option
parsing/setup. Basically the emulated FPU is forgetting to tell the
truth about the fact its a very basic FPU.
