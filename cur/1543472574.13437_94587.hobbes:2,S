The GPL is pretty clear. The GPL says it applies to the entire
program, not just to part of it. The GPL defines the entire program as
the program itself and anything linked into the program. The only
exception is for operating system libraries, which are allowed to be
linked into your program even though they may be non-free if you're on
Solaris or etc.
Thus the binary modules bit is shaky but arguable, since the code is not
actually linked into the kernel but, rather, loaded as a separate object
into kernel space via a standard API. mmap.c, on the other hand, is
definitely linked into the kernel and thus IBM cannot replace it with
a proprietary one without the replacement also being under GPL.
