2.6.14.4 -> 2.6.14.5 broke it, 2.6.14 also runs okay, some more info 
on 
http://bugsplatter.mine.nu/test/boxen/deltree/
 -- dmesg, `grep = 
.config`.
This box is the bugsplatter web server, currently running 2.6.14.4.
iptables/netfilter is rejecting constructs containing "state NEW", see:
http://bugsplatter.mine.nu/test/boxen/deltree/iptables-vnL-2.6.14.4-dt
vs
http://bugsplatter.mine.nu/test/boxen/deltree/iptables-vnL-2.6.14.5-dt
some numbers masked with 'zxcv' to protect the guilty :)
