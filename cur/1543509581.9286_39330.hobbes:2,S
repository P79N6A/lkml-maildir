 Not necessarily -- per MPS, NMI needs only to be delivered to the BSP.
Exact LINT0 and LINT1 routing should be described by the MP Configuration
Table (provided it's correct, sigh).

 No, no, no.  Although MPS does not explicitly forbide ceasing to connect
of any IRQ lines to I/O APICs, in real life the only IRQs that may be
unconnected are IRQ0 and IRQ13 due to legacy EISA chipsets.  As we do not
care of EISA DMA chaining interrupts (do we?), we may set up IRQ0 as a
"through-8259A" interrupt which is more reliable and it needs no acking at
all.  This is the Intel-recommended way of handling DMA chaining
interrupts, BTW -- see the 82489DX datasheet.  In short, after merging in
my patches, no board should ever use ExtINTA interrupts when in the
symmetric mode.
 In fact there is no difference between configuring LINT0 as Fixed and NMI
-- none of them make INTA cycles reach 8259As.
 Of course, there might exist a board that would need ExtINTA interrupts
but it's pretty unlikely and even if it existed it would be an ancient
proprietary design and it really would not be able to receive periodic
NMIs in a standard manner.  I doubt such boards exist.  If you know of
such one, let me know.

 AFAIK, the MPS does not force any specific requirements on delivery modes
in the symmetric mode -- it does specify the routing of IRQ lines and the
AT compatibility.  If you know of a specific paragraph of MPS that stands
in contradiction to my proposals, please name it!

 How would you perform this?  The PC does not provide a configurable
delivery mode -- it's always "Fixed".  And even if it would it's
completely unportable -- it does not exist on i486 and Pentium systems at
all.

 Tomorrow, as I wrote.  The oopser is not an absolute necessity -- it may
as well go into 2.5 -- I'd just like to look at it while I am at i386/SMP.
