I do not think his patch is needed.
So the question arises: do we need a kernel patch, and if so, what patch?
The program loadkeys exists to load the kernel keymap with the map the user
desires. So, if you need some particular map the obvious answer is:
"use loadkeys".
There is a small snag - until 2.4 the value of NR_KEYS was 128,
while 2.6 uses 256. Moreover, the keys you want to change are above 128.
So, your old precompiled loadkeys will not do - you must recompile the
kbd package against 2.6 kernel headers, or just edit loadkeys.y and dumpkeys.c
inserting
#undef NR_KEYS
#define NR_KEYS 256
after all includes, and then compile on any Linux machine.
There is no need to have knowledge of the Japanese keymap in the kernel,
just as there is no knowledge of the German or French keymap. That
knowledge belongs in the keymap that one loads.
