Nope. I've got a friend who has a Viao with built-in EtherNet and he
has a wireless LAN card. He uses either depending on where he is.
Also, sometimes I plug in two PCMCIA network cards.

This absolutely has to be fixed. It's quite brain-dead. I've noticed
this before, but haven't gotten around to pestering anyone about it
yet (minor problems like yenta.o locking up and cardmgr crashing have
to be fixed first:-).
Can someone post why this has broken and why a fix is (I presume)
difficult? I'll have to look at this myself if no-one else fixes it by
the time the other issues are fixed :-(
