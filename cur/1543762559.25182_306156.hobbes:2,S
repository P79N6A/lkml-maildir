 Sounds great.  :-)

 What I meant was we could just use scsi_cmnd instead of scsi_request
for commands.  Currently, we do the following for special commands.
 1. Allocate scsi_request and request (two are linked)
 2. Initialize scsi_request as needed
 3. queue the request
 4. the request is dispatched
 5. scsi_cmnd is initialized from scsi_request
 6. scsi_cmnd is executed
 7. result code and sense copied back to scsi_request
 8. request is completed
 Instead, we can
 1. Allocate scsi_cmnd and request (two are linked)
 2. Initialize scsi_cmnd as needed
 3. queue the request
 4. the request is dispatched
 5. scsi_cmnd is executed
 6. request is completed
 As the latter seemed more straight-forward to me, I was wondering if
there were reasons that I wasn't aware of.
 Thanks.
