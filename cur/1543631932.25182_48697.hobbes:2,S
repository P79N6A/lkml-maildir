I'm not referring to just *non* x86 arches in this case. Sorry about
that. Any setup can be non-monolithic, but the measurement to decide if
it is cost worthy is price/performance ratio. 
I'm not saying that "if it's not x86, it's monolithic",  in the context
of the discussion, it's really about large costly boxes, designed to be
large, costly boxes. That, from this perspective, is monolithic.
