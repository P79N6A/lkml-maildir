That would be nice, yes, bastardizing pos for this is, humm, ugly, and
it isn't accessible at show time (pun intended 8) ).
But now I have to chainsaw the /proc/net/route support into shape, and
this one will be fun, as I'll have to change the semantics of the
struct fib_table tb_seq_show so that I can grab the lock at fib_seq_start,
and at fib_seq_show pass just one entry, then drop the lock at fib_seq_stop.
So, probably we'll have fib_table::tb_seq_{start, next, show, start}, humm,
this gave another idea... :)
