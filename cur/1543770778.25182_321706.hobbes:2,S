Will there ever be one again (at least in the foreseeable future)?
We've had "Linus = stable, -mm = unstable" for a long time now, and it
seems pretty much official now that there won't be a 2.7 anytime soon.
The actual development of new features is happening in the relevant
maintainers' trees, anyway, so there simply seems to be no need for a
single highly development-oriented tree (like 2.5 was) anymore - quite
the contrary.
