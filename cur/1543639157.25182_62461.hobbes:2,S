Another possibility could be the kernel process and the task processes sharing
a pending signal queue, either for one particular signal or all signals. The
kernel process would block SIGIO while the task runs and when the task enters
kernel mode with a SIGIO still trapped in the task process, SIGIO would get
delivered in the kernel and cleared from the shared pending queue, which is
just what we want.
Someone actually already tried implementing it with a clone extension, see
