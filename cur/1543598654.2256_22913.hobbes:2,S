I think I fixed it long ago - we shipped it with Red Hat Linux 7.1
on ia64, and in errata for i386. I recall arguing about it with
Georg Archer, and it was accepted into Linus tree. But perhaps not
every hole was plugged.

Well, good. If you have an SMP problem - post to the list.
I have 2 SMPs, one with uchi and one with ohci, which run well.
People used to think that USB on SMP was a non-issue, but
unfortunately companies like Dell started to ship rackmounted
SMPs with USB keyboards :)

I think the JE uhci forgets to post a callback sometimes,
so I'll look. Meanwhile, try to remove that printout -
it's only for JE uhci bughunt.
