Subject: Unexpected IO-APIC messages

When booting up 2.4.2-2smp (RH 7.1) on a new system here, the kernel
complains about the IO-APIC register contents, and asks that mail be
sent to linux-smp@vger.kernel.org.
It appears that the linux-smp list is defunct; at least there have been
no new messages archived on geocrawler since August 2000.  It also
appears that the new IO APIC reg01.version of 0x20 was reported about
a year ago on the linux-smp list, and reg_01.__reserved_2 of 0x80 was
reported on this list around February 2001.  
The relevant dmesg info from our machine follows:
----
testing the IO APIC.......................
IO APIC #2......
.... register #00: 02000000
.......    : physical APIC id: 02
.... register #01: 00178020
.......     : max redirection entries: 0017
.......     : IO APIC version: 0020
 WARNING: unexpected IO-APIC, please mail
          to linux-smp@vger.kernel.org
 WARNING: unexpected IO-APIC, please mail
          to linux-smp@vger.kernel.org
.... register #02: 00000000
.......     : arbitration: 00
----
The APIC information from lspci -v follows:
----
03:00.0 PIC: Intel Corporation 82806AA PCI64 Hub Advanced Programmable Interrupt
 Controller (rev 01) (prog-if 20 [IO(X)-APIC])
        Subsystem: Intel Corporation 82806AA PCI64 Hub Advanced Programmable Int
errupt Controller
        Flags: fast devsel
        Memory at fe400000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [disabled] [size=4K]
----
If anyone is planning to do anything about new IO-APIC versions and stuff,
at least the mailing list address should be corrected.
If nobody cares until a bug comes along, perhaps the message should be
changed to say "unrecognized" or "unknown" rather than unexpected, so
the d**n users don't pee in their pants when they see the boot log
scrolling by.
Or maybe just parse and print out the values and refer the user to
linux/Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt (which also still refers to the
linux-smp mailing list) for further information.
Thanks,
