Hi,
It seems the story of the greatest piece of software ever written
is being hit by the bluez of having to support too many seperate
addon hardware devices, which the coders themselves in many cases
never heard of. Until the udev problems showup.
The key piece of trouble is udev which has nowadays has to run
in close cooperation with a daemon called hald. I wonder if linux is
trying to solve the problems of 'broken by design' addon hardware?
To me it just looks like polishing up a can of maggots.
The most evil category seem to be USB camara's , photo devices, etc.
"I've even created a standalone udev rule - 
  BUS="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="04a9", SYSFS{idProduct}=="3113",
  MODE="0660", GROUP="camera", NAME="canon", SYMLINK="camera
"aah canon ... with a canon you can't!"
So is there a smart way out of this mess?
Regards,
Robert
