To start with, see <
http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-raif.html>
 for
software and documentation.  RAIF is storage virtualization at the file
level.  It can do levels 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and several combos.  It's
designed such that you could easily plugin a new RAID policy/level that you
invent.  We've got LB functionality too (RR and proportional share).  And
you can configure stuff on a per file, per dir, or per file-type basis.
BTW, the lkml forum may not be the best forum to discuss it: better divert
future discussions to fsdevel or one of our lists (which you can get to from
the RAIF project URL above).
Cheers,
Erez.
