Subject: Trouble shooting a ten minute boot delay (SiI3112)

I added a PCI SATA controller to my computer. Immediately after grub
loads the kernel there is a consistent ten minute delay before the
kernel displays its first message. I tested Linux 2.6.8 and 2.6.11
both from Debian, and 2.6.11 from Knoppix, all of which experience the
same delay.
The SATA controller is connected to two 200 GB Seagate SATA
ST3200826AS drives. I managed to install Debian on the system, though
the install was perilous, and once booted the system runs wonderfully!
Any suggestions on how I can trouble shoot the ten minute boot delay?
I don't reboot frequently, but it is irksome.
What's the appropriate mailing list for SATA questions, perhaps
linux-ide or linux-scsi?
Please cc me in your reply. Thanks!
Shaun
