Hi there, I am a bit timid to post a message to the list after reading the FAQ,
but I did get a problem. When reply, please cc to my email address.
My kernel info: Linux version 2.6.8 (root@zhiyi) (gcc version 3.3.5 (Debian
1:3.3.5-8)) #1
Everytime (except the first time) I unload my module (a ram device), I got the
following message. Please just indicate if it is a kernel bug or if there is any
fix patch. At the moment I have no clue. I used kmalloc and alloc_page to
allocate memory dynamically when the ram device grows. And I freed them
when the module is unloaded of course.
Hello world from Template Module
