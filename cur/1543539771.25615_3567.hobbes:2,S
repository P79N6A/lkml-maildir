After looking at this web page (and reading other threads), I'm still
stuck.
My driver makes the call to daemonize(), which drops all resources and sets
our parent process to be init, but I still see zombie threads left over.
Does anyone else have any ideas what might be going wrong?  My source code
is in drivers/usb/storage/usb.c
