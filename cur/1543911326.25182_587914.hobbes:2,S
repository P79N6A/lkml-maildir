-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
This patch (as964) was suggested by Steffen Koepf.  It makes
usb_get_descriptor() retry on all errors other than ETIMEDOUT, instead
of only on EPIPE.  This helps with some devices.
