Hey! Good spotting! Since the person with the problem didn't send in
his devfsd configuration file, I'm guessing you ran across this
problem yourself?
FYI: recent versions of devfsd now also generate synthetic REGISTER
events for directories. So even with older kernels, people need to fix
their config files.
