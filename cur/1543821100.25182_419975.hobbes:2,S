It sounds like a lot of things need some kind of shell-scriptable  
transaction interface for sysfs files.  You don't want to have more  
than one value per file, but reading or writing of some values must  
be done together for consistency reasons.  Is there any way to  
implement something like this?  This would work for the framebuffer  
people and solve the needs of a lot of the people who still want  
ioctls or some other atomic-multivalued transfer that would otherwise  
be a great sysfs candidate.

A process that doesn't care about the transaction (Like a user  
inspecting from a shell), could just cd in and cat random files, and  
it would run a transaction for each file opened, and end the  
transaction when the file is closed.  Obviously that's inefficient,  
but it's obviously correct and works.  Otherwise, from opening the  
transaction filehandle for the first time till closing the last open  
FD to it, the process would get a consistent view of the data, read  
when the "transaction" file is first opened opened.  Perhaps any  
modifications would be synced and written at the close of that  
filehandle.
I don't know if that's something doable given the FD model, but if it  
is, then that's trivial to use for the admin, in shell scripts, perl  
scripts, C programs, etc.  It also works with the one-value-per-file  
sysfs model.
