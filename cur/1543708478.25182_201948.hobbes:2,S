actually, the real hungry peaple should be the Intel engineering staff 
who have been working on the first "ia32e" chip... they started working 
on it let's say 1, 1.5 years ago, maybe 2 or more??? I bet chip 
design-to-silicon time is not 6 months even for Intel...
I kind of see Intel marketing people pressing on them saying: "... in 
the end it's just a backup project, just in case ia64, which is more 
money making, does not take off...".
Maybe they already had a designed "x86 64bit" chip, only more different 
from AMD64 one, but they were forced to refactor it to make it x86-64 
compatible.
