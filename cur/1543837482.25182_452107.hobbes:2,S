it seems it's time that the page struct should have more unions ;)

I think that the advantage of Slab allocator is 
- object is already initizalized at setup, so you don't have to initialize it again at
  allocation.
- object is initialized only once when slab is created.
If a slab page is returned to page allocator ASAP, # of object initilization may
increase.
