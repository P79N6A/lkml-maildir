Probably, but that seems like an extremely heavy solution.  Won't it
turn my box into a space heater?
I'm thinking of replacing get_cycles() with low level code to just read
the PM timer.  I can deal with the slowness, this is just a debug
feature after all.
It seems that there might be a solution involving per CPU data, but I'm
not nearly a good enough kernel hacker to attempt that.
(I hope AMD fixes this issue in a future generation of CPUs.  At least,
they seem to acknowledge that it's a bug...)
