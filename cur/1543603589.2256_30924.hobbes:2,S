Can you clarify?  I agree that tuning the system for the best LMbench
performance is not a good thing to do!  However, in general on an
8 CPU system with only 2 'active' tasks I would think limiting the
tasks to 2 CPUs would be desirable for cache effects.
I know that running LMbench with 2 active tasks on an 8 CPU system
results in those 2 tasks being 'round-robined' among all 8 CPUs.
Prior analysis leads me to believe the reason for this is due to
IPI latency.  reschedule_idle() chooses the 'best/correct' CPU for
a task to run on, but before schedule() runs on that CPU another
CPU runs schedule() and the result is that the task runs on a
?less desirable? CPU.  The nature of the LMbench scheduler benchmark
makes this occur frequently.  The real question is: how often
does this happen in real-life situations?
