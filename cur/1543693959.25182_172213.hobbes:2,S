It locked my laptop solid after about half an hour answering email with X11 up 
(possibly a panic, but the LEDs weren't flashing.  Nothing in the log between 
the last dhcp lease renewal a few minutes earlier and the start of the next 
cold boot...)
Reverted to test 6 until I feel brave again.  (I've gone back to grad school 
and have homework due monday.)  2.6.0-test6 sometimes boots up with a dead 
keyboard, but has yet to spontaneously hang on me after bootup...
No clue how to debug this one.  It died while I was typing an email (between 
one keystroke and the next, my screen was suddenly a bitmap.  No mouse 
movement, the little CPU use indicator stopped fluctuating (at zero), etc).
I had an rsync going in the background through a dhcp wireless connection 
(backing up my /home partition to a remote machine), KDE up with kmail 
sending and receiving email, and a couple of web browser windows minimized 
that may have been doing page refreshes...  But otherwise, nothing special.  
(Running off of battery with a little under half of it left...)
