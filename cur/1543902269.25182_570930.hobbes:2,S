I think this patch (on top of the previous one) actually makes the
code clearer, and also makes it smaller:
add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/3 up/down: 0/-41 (-41)
function                                     old     new   delta
mthca_tavor_post_send                       1344    1335      -9
mthca_tavor_post_receive                     792     776     -16
mthca_arbel_post_send                       1481    1465     -16
So I'll test this a bit and probably merge it.
