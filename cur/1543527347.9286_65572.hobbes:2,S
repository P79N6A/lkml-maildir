	We distribute a "univerasal" base modules.conf file as part of
pciconf (
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/pub/dist/device_control/pciconf-0.69.tar.gz
).
I am happy to accept updates and release new versions of pciconf promptly
to reflect those updates.
	By the way, I have a suggestion for modprobe.  I wish that
modprobe would allow "if -f" to accept method of generating the
/lib/modules/<kernel_version> path, so this file could directly support
different kernel versions where certain module names have changed
(like ide-probe and ide-probe-mod) without the need for these more
complex scripts in pciconf to modify the customized portion of the
modules.conf file at boot time.  The last time I checked, "if -f" did
not support backquotes (although I would prefer some mechanism that
did not require modprobe to exec yet another program, especially for
a value that might be evaluated several times each time modules.conf.base
is traversed).
