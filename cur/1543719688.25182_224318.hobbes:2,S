Hmm.. do we need to worry about the same DoS issues we need to worry about with
mlock and friends?  I know I can trust myself to not do stupid things to said
flags on my laptop (well... not twice anyhow ;).  On the other hand, I have
systems with clueless users, and the even more dangerous half-clued users.  And
then I have a bunch of machines in our security lab, where Bad Things happen
all the time...
