Which socket? IP/UDP or UNIX one? You know, UNIX sockets are a little
special - both ends are on the same machine. This is why the sending
routine can check the receiving queue length.

You're missing the fact that the kernel _has_ code to help but this
_existing_ code is broken (and yes, it was fine in earlier kernels).
