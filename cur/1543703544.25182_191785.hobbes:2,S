I've not followed the 2.6 development regarding the arch selection that
closely; let's collect arguments: 
- Is it still possible to run a -march=i486 built kernel on a pentium? 
  IMHO It would be good to optimize the code for i486, but I'm not that 
  familiar with how good gcc optimizes for 486 that I can comment this.
- I personally work with lots of cross architectures like ARM, so cross
  compiling for an embedded system is no problem for me. But if people
  want to test stuff on their pentiums I also have no problem with that.
Other arguments? 
Robert
