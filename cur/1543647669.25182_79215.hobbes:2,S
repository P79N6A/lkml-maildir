Dave H,
The short term patch will not bring your queue_depth value back up all
the way. The ips drivers cmd_per_lun value is 16. The old method would
distribute the queue_depth among the devices on the adapter. I believe
your system has a ServeRAID 4M which means you could have had a
queue_depth as high as 95. This seems high but from your numbers a value
higher than 16 is most likely needed.
You can check your old and new values post booting the kernel if you have
sg configured in with:
cat /proc/scsi/sg/device_hdr /proc/scsi/sg/devices

David J,
Here is a quick patch for you to review. I tested and seems to bring my
system back up to per patch queue depth values. I used a enq value to
simulate past behavior in the attach function. I tested with one logical
and two logical devices.
Here is some sg output at different kernel and logical driver values.
2.5.40 1 logical drive:
host    chan    id      lun     type    opens   qdepth  busy    online
0       0       0       0       0       3       31      0       1
2.5.40 2 logical drives:
host    chan    id      lun     type    opens   qdepth  busy    online
0       0       0       0       0       3       15      0       1
0       0       1       0       0       0       15      0       1
2.5 current 2 logical drives: 
host    chan    id      lun     type    opens   qdepth  busy    online
0       0       0       0       0       3       1       0       1
0       0       1       0       0       0       1       0       1
2.5 current 2 logical drives + patch:
host    chan    id      lun     type    opens   qdepth  busy    online
0       0       0       0       0       3       15      0       1
0       0       1       0       0       0       7       0       1
2.5 current 2 logical drives + patch post some IO:
host    chan    id      lun     type    opens   qdepth  busy    online
0       0       0       0       0       3       15      0       1
0       0       1       0       0       0       15      0       1
