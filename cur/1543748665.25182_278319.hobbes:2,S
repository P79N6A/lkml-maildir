I agree with you on this.

I don't quite understand your point here. 
Say you have process A at prio 20 that waits on a queue with server S. S
becomes prio 20 and starts to run. Then it is preempted by process B at
prio 30 which then comes to wait on the server's queue. Server S becomes
prio 30 and finishes process A's work, then checks the queue again and
finds process B and starts working on process B's work still at prio 30.
The time of process B is still bounded (predictable).
So it's similar to a mutex and priority inheritance. We can look at
process A taking lock L and then when process B blocks on lock L,
process A inherits process B's priority (B being greater prio than A).
The difference is that the work is being done within a mutex as suppose
to a server. The work to keep track of what priorities are being
inherited is even easier than mutexs, since you have a process (the
server) to just point to which process it has inherited, and a wait
queue to store which process needs to be inherited next when the server
wakes up the currently inherited process.
