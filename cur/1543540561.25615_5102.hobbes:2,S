The first version of the new VM will be in english
and it'll be written today.

I have some code for the multiqueue VM here, but after UKUUG
and OLS the design has been changed a bit so I'll have to
write new code ;)
The important thing here is that we now have a design that
is agreed on by almost everybody (hacking VM and present
at OLS) and that none of us could shoot holes in.
regards,
Rik
