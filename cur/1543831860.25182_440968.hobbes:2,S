Do you currently have any page/doc/wiki about the current efforts in
writing an API to handle fingerprint stuff ? (as in (3))

Yeah, that's the idea that I had in mind at first. I/we could start by
taking a look on the current API implementations from the most common
devices to get a whole idea of what's involved (for example some fancy
readers may provide ways to control a LED that indicates the state of
the device, etc, and it may be programmable, others not). We could put
everything in a Wiki separated by devices, and fix a date where we can
start discussing the first API.

Sweet =)
Well.. I was thinking about keeping that stuff on kernel more for
conservative reasons (driver == kernel). I really would like the idea
of having something very nice (and under a standard) to have
information about the devices on the system, as sysfs is progressing
to do so. I already explained in earlier e-mails about what I had in
mind, but it can only, of course, run in kernel mode. Mixing userspace
and kernel mode drivers will mess it up anyways. Imagine my wonderful
world: every device and information that you may want to know about
any device on your system is on /sys, and not only "obscure" things
like BUS ID, vendor ID, etc, but userspace-useful info like
resolution, capabilities, etc. A tool like "si" could easily parse
/sys to show everything about your system. And since all drivers (in
kernelspace) are specifically implemented to handle their devices,
they can know _exactly_ their properties, and export them.
In the real world, however, if we want to have information about our
devices, we need to sweat it from a range of ioctl()'s, /dev's and
userspace devices (sometimes direct access to memory, as I think that
the (old?) superprobe used to do). Since sysfs is an effort (between
others) to centralize such informations, why blow it by sparsing
information onto userspace ?
Even though I believe that the place for drivers is in the kernel, I
don't have _practical_ reasons to insist on that (at least for
fingerprint devices), and as I can see that this concept of userspace
vs. kernelspace drivers was already heavily discussed, I won't sweat
to find a reason to get it into the kernel... Just feel that would be
good to have everything under one single place, sounding more like a
standard.
Anyways, how idmouse got into the mainstream kernel, then ?
