Note that the 'init' of linuxrc (/sbin/nash or /sbin/sash) also
has a PID of 1. It gets replaced with /sbin/init or whatever you
use for an emergency shell.
You can load a kernel thread from a driver that gets installed
by initrd. This would allow you to have processes running with
PIDs greater than 1 before the final init gets started. The
present kernel starts quite a few threads up to PID=8 right
now.
Once 'init' gets started, you are going to have either new 'inits'
exec(ed) with PID 1 or children with PIDs greater than 1.
