cool write up..
http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/tlk/tlk.html
but i just had 1 question:
is there anything similar to what microsoft has pulled of with msdn in the
linux world?
i mean there is man and all,
but is there anything more "user friendly" and in the digital means besides
Beg. Linux Programming (2nd edition)?
it would be really cool, if someone could point me out to something if it
existed...
laterz,
akbar A.
