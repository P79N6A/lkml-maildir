It's not clear to me this is a good way to go.  It will make things
work neatly in the case where the correct action on a compound page is
to do nothing (and we already have a mapping == NULL test).  However
it will fail silently in cases where we actually need to get at the
mapping for a compound page (so we need to check for CompoundPage and
find the master page).  The existing code will probably blow up in
that case, at least showing there's a problem.
