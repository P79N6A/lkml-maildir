I personally think this is good. Not only this allows us to close the race,
I think we can do more.

How about take this lock in thaw_tasks() instead/too ?
Currently we need a separate loop in thaw_tasks() to handle PF_FREEZER_SKIP. This
means that PF_FREEZER_SKIP is not so generic: thaw_tasks() can't tolerate if such
a task was woken in between. What if we change thaw_process() to clear TIF_FREEZE ?
Note also that we can use task_lock() instead of global refrigerator_lock. This
means that thaw_process() should take it too, probably this is slowdown, but I
think not too much because thaw_process() is going to write to p->flags anyway.
In this case thaw_process() works perfectly as cancel_freezing_and_thaw() and
can be used to fix exec/coredump in future.
Thoughts?
Oleg.
