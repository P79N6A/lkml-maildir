The minimal fix would be to put #ifdef CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG around the 
call to pci_mmcfg_late_init in drivers/acpi/bus.c.

I'm not sure there's a point in making the prototypes for those 
functions global to all architectures, since it's unlikely anything 
non-X86 could make use of them with any similar semantics. We could 
provide a no-op definition of those functions to avoid the need to ifdef 
the calls, though.
