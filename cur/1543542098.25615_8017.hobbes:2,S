Read as "continuations in user space"? Sure. 
It's not that I agree or prefer it, it's just that I don't care at that
point ;)

I suspect the Java run-time had better do a lot of these decisions itself.
I don't think they are all that appropriate decisions to make for the
kernel.

I don't think it's an issue of efficiency - you end up doing the work
anyway. It may well be true that some of the interfaces aren't perfect for
Java threads, and maybe that could be improved upon, but I can't say that
I've seen any really convincing arguments for "performance" and "Java"
yet.
