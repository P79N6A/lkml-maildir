i think we should try Mike's patches after smpnice got ironed out. The 
extreme-starvation cases should be handled more or less correctly now by 
the minimal set of changes from Mike that are upstream (knock on wood), 
the singing-dancing add-ons can probably wait a bit and smpnice clearly 
has priority.
