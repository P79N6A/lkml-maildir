What you are talking about is a LISP machine micro-kernel in Ring0 which 
sort of defeats the whole point of Linux being monolithic kernel. Also 
couldn't we just run HURD, or for that matter EMACS ;-), as a kernel. I, 
personally have come around to Linus point of view on the whole 
micro-kernel thing so I don't see much of a advantage to this, as there 
are other micro kernel projects ( HURD, Darwin/*BSD?).
