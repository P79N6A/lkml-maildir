It's not entirely unintuitive.  That option's full name is "Support for
suspend on SMP and hot-pluggable CPUs".
Only the place where you find the option is unintuitive, as far as its
first application is concerned.  (It lives in the "Processor type and
features" menu which is OK for the 2nd application of this option.)  And
the variable name of that option is unintuitive because it covers only
the 2nd application of the option, I suppose for historical reasons.

Yes, that's the price to pay if you want to select something that in
turn depends on a number of other things.
Wait, doesn't HOTPLUG_CPU also depend on EXPERIMENTAL?
