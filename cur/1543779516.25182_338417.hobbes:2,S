This patch should fix two cases. Can anybody familiar with signal
handling look at it?
The posix standard said for sigtimedwait:
"If no signal in set is pending at the time of the call, the calling
thread shall be suspended until one or more signals in set become
pending or until it is interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal."
Systemcall might be restarted if it's not interrupted by a caught
signal.
Thanks,
