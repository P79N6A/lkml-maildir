I got the same amount of reply when I posted a similar problem  
("mptable irq info wrong on Tyan S5112, need advice") a few days  
before you.
What I have debugged is (for the 2.4 kernel) the motherboard IRQ  
tables that are passed to the kernel via mpparse.c are dead wrong. In  
my case, I was able to hack the kernel and hunt down the correct  
interrupt. I'm actually surprised that there aren't more systematic  
IRQ debug utilities out there in the Linux world, given how many  
problems go unsolved across many lists.
I'm trying to build a small knowledge base on this breed of problem  
(bad IRQ assignments due to motherboard snafus). I've got a couple  
writeups in the works, but the first is about a very useful utility  
that dumps the mobo IRQ info (the mptable data, to be specific):
