Hi!
I've been working on some userspace usb drivers in which I use the
asynchronous usb devio URB delivery to usrerspace.
There have always been some bug reports of kernel oopses while
terminating a program that uses the driver.
Now I found out a way to relatively easy trigger that oops from pcscd
(part of pcsc-lite) on any kernel, at least tested with 2.6.8 to 2.6.14-rc2.
Call Trace:

 [<c010388a>] common_interrupt+0x1a/0x20
So what do we learn from that?  That usb_hcd_giveback_urb() is called
from in_interrupt() context and calls async_completed(). 
async_completed() calls send_sig_info(), which in turn does a
spin_lock(&tasklist_lock) to protect itself from task_struct->sighand
from going away.  However, the call to
"spin_lock_irqsave(task_struct->sighand->siglock)" causes an oops,
because "sighand" has disappeared.
If a process issues an URB from userspace and (starts to) terminate
before the URB comes back, we run into the issue described above.  This
is because the urb saves a pointer to "current" when it is posted to the
device, but there's no guarantee that this pointer is still valid
afterwards.  
This basically means that any userspace process with permissions to 
any arbitrary USB device can Ooops any kernel.(!)
In fact, there are two separate issues:
1) the pointer to "current" can become invalid, since the task could be
   completely gone when the URB completion comes back from the device.
   This can be fixed by get_task_struct() / put_task_struct().
2) Even if the saved task pointer is still pointing to a valid task_struct, 
   task_struct->sighand could have gone meanwhile.  Therefore, the USB
   async URB completion handler needs to reliably check whether
   task_struct->sighand is still valid or not.  In order to prevent a
   race with __exit_sighand(), it needs to grab a
   read_lock(&tasklist_lock).  This strategy seems to work, since the
   send_sig_info() code uses the same protection.  
   However, we now need to export a __send_sig_info() function, one that
   expects to be called with read_lock(&tasklist_lock) already held by
   the caller.  It's ugly, but I doubt there is a less invasive
   solution.
Expected FAQ's:
a) Q: But grabbing references to "current" and delivering URB completion
      via signals is totally invalid and broken in may ways !
   A: Yes, but dozens of userspace apps/drivers rely on this broken API.
      As long as there's no new, sane, usbdevio2, we cannot just rip it
      out without a replacement.
b) Q: Why can't wa use the normal SIGIO mechanism?
   A: Because the usbdevio API needs to pass a __user pointer to the URB
      along the delivered signal.
c) Q: If this is a local DoS, why did you post it publicly?
   A: Because I've already informed linux-usb-devel in May.
I suggest this (or any other) fix to be applied to both 2.6.14 final and
the stable series.  I didn't yet investigate 2.4.x, but I think it is
likely to have the same problem.
Cheers,

[USBDEVIO] Fix user-triggerable Oops in usbdevio async URB completion
If a process issues an URB from userspace and (starts to) terminate
before the URB comes back, we run into the issue described above.  This
is because the urb saves a pointer to "current" when it is posted to the
device, but there's no guarantee that this pointer is still valid

   This can be fixed by get_task_struct() / put_task_struct().
2) Even if the saved task pointer is still pointing to a valid task_struct,
   task_struct->sighand could have gone meanwhile.  Therefore, the USB
