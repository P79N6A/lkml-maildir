I think alternative b) - three new syscalls, sounds better.
The only negatives so far are that it adds more syscalls and that it might
require code duplication with posix timers. The syscall numbers argument
seemed not to be very important and the code duplication should be fixable
by refactoring the code so that more is shared between the two systems (I
assume).
Overloading file descriptors with flags looks ugly, is there any other
syscall which does that?
