Essentially the tg3 Ethernet driver is trying to allocate memory to 
store a received packet, and is unable to do so. Since this is done 
inside interrupt context, this allocation has to be serviced from 
physical memory. Order 1 means it only wanted one page of memory, and 
since that failed it looks like the system must have been awfully short 
on available physical RAM.. it could be some kind of kernel memory leak 
or VM issue, though this condition may not be entirely unexpected in 
certain cases, like if the system has little physical RAM free at a 
certain point and then a flood of network packets arrive.
