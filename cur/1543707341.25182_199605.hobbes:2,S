From "man sendmsg" in Debian unstable (manpage is dated 2003-10-25).
ENOBUFS
The output queue for a network interface was full.  This generally 
indicates that the interface  has  stopped  sending, but  may be 
caused by transient congestion.  (Normally, this does not occur in 
Linux. Packets are just silently dropped when a device queue 
overflows.)
