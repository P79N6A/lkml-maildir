Well, I thought the subject itself described the problem in one line :), I
guess I should be more verbose?  OK.

Comments :). Well the idea was to describe the difference between 
__cache_alloc and ____cache_alloc, I mean, these are two similar sounding
functions with extra underscores.  OK, maybe I was being too verbose here?

Yes, the conditions being cpuset constraints or a mempolicy being in place.
Again, since objects can be allocated off other nodes under certain
conditions, I thought it was good to document it...

This is the case when we are requesting an object from a non existent
node/invalid node.  So we have 2 choices, either to spread the allocations 
as per the cpuset constraints (the same treatment as kmalloc), or to 
allocate from the requesting node, either ways we are not strictly 
confirming to the user's choice of node (which we cannot).  I cannot see 
major advantage or disadvantage either ways, so I chose to keep the policy
in current mainline code -- spread according to the policy set.
