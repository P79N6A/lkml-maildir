It turns out that (at least for 2.6.10-rc3 and later) the kernel
resumes from S3 perfectly regardless of .config as long as
- no framebuffer console is activated (kernel param video=vesa:off )
- pci-resume-2.6.10.patch and resume-finish-split-2.6.10.patch
  are applied
- suspend and resume happen with an active TEXT console (chvt 2)
- VESA registers are saved before suspend
- the radeon card is POSTed after resume
- the VESA registers are restored after that
- now you are free to change back to X if you want.
You do NOT need
- a patched X server
- a special kernel .config
- sacrifices of any kind.
See my other mail to acpi-devel for details about how to save/restore
the VESA registers and POST the card.
Question for the framebuffer experts: Is it possible to forbid access
to the video card after resume until the card has been POSTed and all
registers are restored? Any access to the card before that will freeze
the machine.

Carl-Daniel
