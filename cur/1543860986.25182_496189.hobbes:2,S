I'm using a tmpfs as a mostly-ramdisk, that is I've set up a large swap
partition in case I need the RAM instead of using it for a filesystem.
Therefore it will sometimes have a backing store.
OTOH, ramfs does not have this property (the cache is the backing store),
so it would make sense to allow it at least there.
BTW: Maybe you could use a ramdisk instead of the loop-on-tmpfs.
