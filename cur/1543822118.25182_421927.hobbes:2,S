i would like to have more information about this
so within the app
after create the socket
then call setsockopt (!?)
to set the TCP_CONGESTION into "lp" (in my case) ??
is that means the socket's congestion algorithm will then be what i set ??
in this socket within this app only ??
how about the socket create by "accept" ??
it will still use the default ?? or as listen socket ??
thanks
