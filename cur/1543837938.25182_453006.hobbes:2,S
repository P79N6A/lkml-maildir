I separated storage initialization into special function, although it is
quite simple, but it allows not to have a lot of duplicated steps in
each origin (inode, socket, file, AIO, network AIO, poll, timer and so
on). If later some members will be changed or added/removed there will
be no need to change them all instead change one function.

Only poll nitialization.

No problem, I will create such structure instead of pointer-based
scheme.

My test code prints it to stdout and I can show a nice graph of how
precise timer is.

It is a timestamp of fired condition (measured in jiffies), I can not
say if it exposes jiffies to userspace or not.
It is not a requirement to use that field, it can contain zero or any
other number, I placed jiffies there.

For the purpose of evnt timestamp it is more than enough.

Ok, I will use it instead late_initcall().
