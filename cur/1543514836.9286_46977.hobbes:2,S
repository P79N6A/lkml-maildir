I'll answer several questions including what you did not ask.
o	The case of memory-mapped devices:
	It's RAM. Until it is allocated for a driver it can be used
	for RAM. It may be slow RAM, but it's RAM.
o	Scattered writes/reads, i.e., a page appart should go
	to the physical RAM. I have never seen it do differently.
	If it didn't, you would not be able to use memory-mapped
	I/O because the CPU would read its cache instead of physical
	RAM.
