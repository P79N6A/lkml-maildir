I strongly disagree. The RFCs _are_ expected behaviour (with the odd

Because you ran two different speed networks over the same cable without
any seperation ?

Internet standards. Along with the fact your perceived safety isnt there
in the first place. Consider a source routed frame. Consider the fact
most of your daemons bind to INADDR_ANY. It would be a false and misleading
appearance of security at best.
If you want a firewall use firewall rules. If an end user is not sure how to
set up a basic firewall they can run tools like gnome-lokkit and answer simple
questions.

FreeBSD binds arp to the specific interface, but accepts packets on any
(from memory). The warnings it issues about the ARPs are a bug because the
RFC's make no assertions about ARP replies being host or address based.

Hardly. You can have multiple addresses per nic anyway so its all the same
routing hashes. You can also have multiple nics with the same address. Its
already many<->many.
