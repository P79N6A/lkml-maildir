Yeah, probably still a year until the release of 2.4.0.  8)

Assuming that nobody has all the MOD_..._USE_COUNT things culled
from a tree somewhere already, I quickly hacked up the following
script for drivers/net:
----------------
#!/bin/bash
for i in `grep -l 'MOD_..._USE_COUNT;' *.c */*.c`
do
  mv $i $i~
  cat $i~ | \
  sed '/^$/{N;s/.*MOD.*COUNT;//;tz;b;:z;N;s/^\n$//;};/.*MOD.*COUNT;/d' > $i
done
----------------
It looks ugly but it zaps out the extra blank line when MOD_.*COUNT
had a blank line above and below.  I had a quick look at the resulting
diff (4200 lines!) and it looks like the post-script hand editing will
be minimal (e.g. a few arcnet drivers have MOD_*_COUNT as the only code
in an if block).
We might want to filter the file list created by grep against VERSION_CODE
as people with that in their driver(s) probably don't want the wholesale
deletion of MOD_*_COUNT. (OTOH, drivers that have VERSION_CODE that
supports 2.0.38 or oddball 2.3.x versions could probably be pruned...)
That still leaves the addition of dev->owner = THIS_MODULE into
each device probe.  One *hackish* way to do this without having to
deal with each driver could be something like this in netdevice.h
- extern void ether_setup(struct net_device *dev);
+ extern void __ether_setup(struct net_device *dev);
+ static inline void ether_setup(struct net_device *dev){
+	dev->owner = THIS_MODULE; 	
+	__ether_setup(dev);
+ }
Ugh. Probably should just add it to each probe and be done with it...
Paul. (aka. monkey #937)
