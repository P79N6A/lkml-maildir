Does the vesafb frame-buffer module work on the Intel 810 and Intel 815
Chipset Families? 
No. The vesafb module can only make use of linear
VESA modes. The Intel 810 and Intel 815 chipset families use banked
modes and therefore, cannot boot into a frame-buffer. It would be 
possible to add banked mode support to the vesafb driver, but as of 
yet there are no plans to do so. The vga 16 color framebuffer 
available in recent Linux kernels does function properly and can be 
used in place of the vesafb framebuffer.

My question is obvious by now I assume: are there plans implementing
banked mode support to the vesafb driver?
