Yes.  We might well have released the page before shrink_mmap() next
comes around to it.  Think about a binary which exits and is respawned.
We want any usage information (the PG_referenced bit) to survive the
exit() so that it is not immediately evicted from cache once the process
exits and shrink_mmap starts taking an interest in it.
