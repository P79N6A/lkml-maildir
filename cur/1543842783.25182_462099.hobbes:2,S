There are few enough of them, I've grep'ed, so that should be doable.
The segher mentioned in favor of his approach (option B -> ioremap
flags) that doing a test in writeX/readX is very cheap compared to the
cost of IOs in general and would make driver conversion easier: you
don't have to change a single occurence of writel/readl : just add the
necessary barriers and change the ioremap call. Thus I tend to agree
that his approach makes it easier from a driver writer point of view.
Now, I don't have a strong preference myself, which is why I asked for a
vote here. So far, I could your vote for A :)
Ben.
