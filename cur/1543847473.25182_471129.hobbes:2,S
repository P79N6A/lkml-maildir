Well, some architectures currently expext __u64/__s64 to be
long long even with 64 bits. Changing that will likely cause
a number of new compiler warnings about conversion between
these. Of course it would be nice to clean these up, since
it's already a pain to printk() a variable of type u64.
More importantly, your code has the problem that it relies
on a CONFIG_* symbol, which will break when user space includes
the file, because that does not have config.h.
