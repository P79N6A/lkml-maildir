Hello,
perhaps someone could help me. 
I want to setup an Application Level Firewall with transparent proxies.
So I installed two ethernet cards (eth0 and eth1) on my Linux System running Kernel 2.2.0. 
I configured the kernel to use transparent proxy Support and Firewall.
After that I used ipchains to redirect all the traffic comming from the
internel ethernetdevice to my firewall on a special TCP Port (example: when
using Port 23 it is redirected to port 9023). 
It only works, when enable ip_forwarding, but I do not want to enable it. I
will do the hole work via my Proxy Application. 
My question is: 
Is it right that (port) redirecting only works when
enabling ip_forwarding? Or is something wrog with my configuration. 
If it does not work, how can I implement such a transparent firewall?
(How can I use / setup the Linux Kernel to redirect the ip packet to an other Port on
my local machine)
Greetings
Marc Plaggemeier
