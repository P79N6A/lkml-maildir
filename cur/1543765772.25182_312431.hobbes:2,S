Because there is no safe way in which you could have multiple
of these modules loaded simultaneously - say one security
module and AFS.  There is an SMP race during the installing
of the hooks, and the modules can still wreak havoc if they
get unloaded in the wrong order...
There just isn't a good way to hook into the syscall table.
