Hmmm...  Looking at my dmesg from the last boot up (which was a clean boot and 
not a resume from suspend), it doesn't seem like the suspend code prints out 
anything when it's checking for a resume image.  (On the other hand, the APIC 
code prints out three screenfulls of useless trivia.  Fun...)
Patrick: is there some kind of debug switch we can set to make it more 
verbose?  (I don't see one in the code.  I'm going to be sprinkling in 
printks myself as soon as my rebuild sans preempt finishes...)
