Andi, please refrain from misrepresenting my position, i can speak for 
myself.
As i stated it before, i'm not against adding some configuration on 
roundup behavior as long as it's clearly add-on optional system policy. 
In fact i already implemented that in the kgdb-light tree.
But if your goal is to create smoke where there is none, then feel free 
to continue to beat down on this poor strawman, ok? ;-) Meanwhile we'll 
continue to clean up kgdb to make it ready for an eventual (and IMO well 
deserved) .26 merge. All the useful bits of your comments have made kgdb 
cleaner - thanks for that. But please lets keep this constructive. 
Thanks,
	Ingo
