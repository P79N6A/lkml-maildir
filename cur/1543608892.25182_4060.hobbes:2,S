	Hello,
	A typo while exporting symbols prevent to use IDE as a module
in 2.4.13-ac7+, to fix it, just move the two lines:
EXPORT_SYMBOL(export_ide_init_queue);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(export_probe_for_drive);
from ide.c to ide-probe.c (I put it at line 914 after the definitions of
both functions), and add ide-probe.o to the the export-objs line in the
Makefile.
	Regards,
	- german
