I'm running 2.2.6 on a little old 486 box. I get the following
output from procinfo:
<not-important stuff snipped>
...
irq  0:   9862714 timer                 irq  6:         3
irq  1:      1521 keyboard              irq  8:         1 rtc
irq  2:         0 cascade [4]           irq 13:         0 fpu
irq  4:        11 serial                irq 14:    408675 ide0
irq  5:     65670 NE2000                irq 129:    362608
And /proc/interrupts looks like this:
           CPU0
  0:    9928497          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       1521          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:         11          XT-PIC  serial
  5:      65850          XT-PIC  NE2000
  8:          1          XT-PIC  rtc
 13:          0          XT-PIC  fpu
 14:     408767          XT-PIC  ide0
NMI:          0
I don't know where the irq 129 and irq 6 are coming from. Is this
just a problem with procinfo? It showed the same thing with 2.3.10
also. Lately the machine has been crashing with no signs and I haven't
changed anything. The only thing this machine does is serve a few
files through NFS. Does anyone know where these strange IRQs are coming
from?
Thanks.
