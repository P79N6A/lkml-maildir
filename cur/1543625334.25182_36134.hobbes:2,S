Hi Richard,
the previous version of my patch did contain a bug,
caused by incorrect parameter order when calling
__devfs_unregister_major. The symptom was, that
major numbers registered with devfs_register_*dev
but not allocated with devfs_alloc_major were not
freed by calling devfs_unregister_*dev. This is
now fixed. Sorry, the patch is attached (due to Notes
messing up with whitespace).
(See attached file: linux-2.4.17-devfs_fixup.diff)
Richard, I would appreciate it if you could finally
look into this.
mit freundlichem Gruß / with kind regards
