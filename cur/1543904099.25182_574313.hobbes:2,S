I certainly cannot speak for all the grotty drivers out there, but I've 
never ever seen anything like the above.  I would consider anyone using 
kernel bit operations on DMA memory to be more than a little crazy.  But 
that's just me :)
Usually you will see
	while (1) {
		rmb();
		if (software_index == hardware_index_in_DMA_memory)
			break;
		
		... handle a unit of work ...
	}
Though ISTR being told that even rmb() was not sufficient in all cases 
[nonetheless, that's what I use in net and SATA drivers and email 
recommendations, and people seem happy]
