So tmpfs is not growing, but you still have a mem leak only with
tmpfs? Is there some deleted file allocating blocks? Or did
redirecting stdout fix the problem. I am not sure that I understand
the situation.

BTW I am running /tmp on tmpfs all the time with KDE and never
experienced something like that. But of course I ran oom without size
limits.
