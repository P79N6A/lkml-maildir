At the moment there is -zero- infrastructure that would allow my tg3 to 
continue working, when I upgrade to a tg3 driver with external firmware.
The user has to put a file in some location manually.
That's a complete non-starter, from a usability standpoint.
Further, several firmwares, including tg3, are really a collection of 
bits of information:  .text, .bss, and random variables (start addr, 
image size, ...).  The current interface is complete crap for this sort 
of setup.
The firmware loader really needs to be loading -archives- not individual 
files.
We are a -long- way from moving the firmware out of the tg3 source code.
