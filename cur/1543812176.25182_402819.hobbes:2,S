Each git tree in -mm has the origin at the start of the patch.  So the
first line of
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc5/2.6.16-rc5-mm1/broken-out/git-nfs.patch
is
GIT 1e28855867c31925e2ffa3a8acf16bb3ad8b634c git://git.linux-nfs.org/pub/linux/nfs-2.6.git
That's "GIT commit-id URL".
