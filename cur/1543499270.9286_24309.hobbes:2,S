This sounds like an excellent idea to me!
I'll bet kernel asserts could be used to considerable effect with a minimal
impact on kernel size and efficiency, so that their default config setting
could be 'on'.  But anyone desiring every last microsecond out of the kernel
could always compile with them off.
