OOPS!
I started downloading your changes from bitkeeper web interface and didn't 
finish that. We have got again out of sync.
I have setup a cvs repository in the meantime. More info at 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/cvs.html
You can add yourself to kgdb project as a developer. Then you'll be able to 
checkin changes yourself.
Thanks.
