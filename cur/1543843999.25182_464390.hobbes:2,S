I prefer 2, where only tifm_sd (and tifm_ms) show up in Kconfig. The
other modules will be "Select":ed via Kconfig.
1 can be a bit confusing for users as they expect a MMC/SD driver to be
in drivers/mmc, but it could be acceptable if it's considered more
important to keep all files in a common place.
3 is out as drivers/mmc isn't for "any flashcard technology". It is
intended to grow with SDIO drivers, so we do not want to clutter it up
with other systems.
Until your (and Winbond's) driver has a generic MemoryStick layer, then
the fact that you use MemoryStick is just an implementation detail. From
the kernel's point of view you're just some odd-ball block driver. When
we have a generic MS layer, we should probably move these to a "ms"
directory, possibly creating a common tree structure for mmc and ms.
