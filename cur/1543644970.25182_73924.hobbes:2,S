I like this, it looks quite nice.
You might want to provide a patch against the development LSM tree
(available at lsm.immunix.org) as that tree already has a lot of ip_*
hooks that have not been submitted to the networking group yet.  If you
do this, I would be glad to add this patch to the LSM tree, which will
keep you from having to do the forward port for all new kernel versions
that come out, if you want.  A number of other security related projects
are already in this tree (SELinux, DTE, LIDS, and others.)
thanks,
