What?
The "bogus" stuff is correct. That's how readX/writeX were _designed_ to
work. The design was the correct one: make it easy to port old drivers to
new architectures - that was what the thing was done for in the first
place. 
It's the _new_ restrictions that people want to have that are bogus, and
they are stuff that will wait for 2.3.x. Changing code for 2.2.x is not an
option.
