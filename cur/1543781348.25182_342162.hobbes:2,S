That is exactly what I did in my proposed patch, attached earlier.
I noticed the same problem.
Does anyone out there know how you can tell if the RageXL chip has
already been initialized?
One test I have that works on my hardware is to test the STAT0
register.  If it ends with 0x95, the chip has not been initialized,
otherwise I initialize it.
