I'm not sure it's that easy.
if we move to pages, then we have to mark pages to be flushed holding
transaction open. now take delayed allocation into account: we need
to allocate number of blocks at once and then mark all pages mapped,
again within context of the same transaction. so, an implementation
would look like the following?
generic_writepages() {
	/* collect set of contig. dirty pages */
	foo_get_blocks() {
		foo_journal_start();
		foo_new_blocks();
		foo_attach_blocks_to_inode();
		generic_mark_pages_mapped();
		foo_journal_stop();
	}
}
another question is will it scale well given number of dirty inodes
can be much larger than number of inodes with dirty mapped blocks
(in delayed allocation case, for example) ?
thanks, Alex
