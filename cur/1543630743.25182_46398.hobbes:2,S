Subject: Htree directory index for Ext2, updated

Precedence: bulk

An updated version of the htree directory index patch for Ext2 is available
at:
   nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/htree-2.4.18-2
This update fixes a corruption-causing bug.
After learning to my horror that gnu patch will, if a patch was made to be 
applied with option -p0, sometimes apply patches to your 'clean' tree (the 
one with the ---'s) instead of the target tree (the one with the +++'s) I 
decided to switch to -p1, and that is how this patch is to be applied.
Changes:
  - Off-by-one bug in second level index block splitting identified
    by Ted using his prototype Htree extensions to e2fsck, isolated using
    same, and fixed by Chris Li (Ted, Chris)
  - Added a missing static, allowing htree to be applied to
    Ext2 and Ext3 simultaneously, withload symbol conflicts (Me)
News:
  - Htree has been ported to Ext3 by Chris Li, patch to be available soon.
    (Chris, do you need a place to post it?)
In progress:
  - Port to Ext3 (Chris)
  - e2fsprogs extensions (Ted)
  - Tuning/testing/finalizing of hash function
  - Delete coalescing
To do:
  - Highmem support (currently buggy)
  - telldir cookie(s)
  - Hash attack resistance
  - Source cleanup
  - Port to 2.5
