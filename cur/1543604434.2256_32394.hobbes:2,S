While compiling 2.4.10-ac11 + keyboard fix for my alpha, I noted that
this is still printed very often:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.10ac11/include/linux/interrupt.h:77: warning: `__cpu_raise_softirq' redefined
/usr/src/linux-2.4.10ac11/include/asm/softirq.h:35: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
Good luck,
Jurriaan
