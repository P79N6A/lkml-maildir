I finally had a chance to try out the 2.2.3ac1 release.
(I assume that this release subsumes the 2.2.2ac7 release?)
I assume you're interested in feedback:  it appears that it's still broken,
and in fact has gotten somewhat slower compared to 2.2.3.
It still takes 6 times as long to transfer a 12 MB file onto a Solaris 2.6 
server than it takes with a mature nfs client like the one used in 
FreeBSD 2.2.8, under identical hardware setup and network topology.
(15 seconds for 2.2.3-ac1 vs. 14 seconds for 2.2.3).  This is with a 
default wsize of 4k.
/proc/mounts:
envy:/server/home/gback /.a/envy/server/home/gback nfs rw,addr=envy 0 0
My other test set, where I write to a synchronously writing BSD ffs server
did get slightly faster (from 30 seconds down to 26 seconds; the BSD nfs 
client took 18 seconds under identical conditions.)
Thanks,
	- Godmar
