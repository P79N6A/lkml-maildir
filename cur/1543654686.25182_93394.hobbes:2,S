There are a couple issues, e.g. in mm/filemap.c, in the patchset I sent.
I'll be looking into it today. I hope to send something within a few
hours. But since tomorrow morning I'm moving, and I'm now packaging et
all, I might have no time to finish it today. In that case until
Wednesday I don't think I'll be able to continue on it...

Yeah, definitely. I'm following the other thread on 2.4.20-rmap15a and
the dl hack. Let's see if we -you really, I'm not yet contributing
anything- can make 2.4.20 work smoothly.
