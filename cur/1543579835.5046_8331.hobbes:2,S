There is something I try to do using Linux and I think you may have a clue:
I want to use the external loopback of my ethernet interface to test it. I
want the data to actually go through the cable and I don't want internal
logic to bypass this process.
There is only one interface available, so I can't use swapped routing as
explained here:
http://www.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/1999week21/0294.html.
I'm not sure if this is kernel specific or if some commands may override
default routing behavior.
Any ideas?
Francois Isabelle
