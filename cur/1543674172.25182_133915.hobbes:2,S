Hi all,
Following code comes from arch/i386/boot/setup.S (memory detection):
387         movb    $0x88, %ah
388         int     $0x15
389         movw    %ax, (2)
Why memory address 2 is used? Where else in the kernel is it used? We are in
real mode, so (2) should be the same as %ds:(2), or not?
Sorry that I'm bugging the mailing list with that question but I didn't
found the answer anywhere. So a web page, a book or something else would be also
nice as an answer.
Regards,
Andy
