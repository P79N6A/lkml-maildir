Yeah, agreed.  I'm quite confused what's going on with all these MWDMA
failures and would really like to know what's broken.  The reason can be
one of the following two.
1. libata itself isn't doing anything wrong but using SCSI for mid and
high level drivers are causing problems as more types of commands are used.
2. Mode programming for MWDMA is broken.  This doesn't seem too likely
as we're seeing MWDMA failures across different low level drivers but is
still a possibility.
However, it's now like drivers/ide drivers didn't have MWDMA problems.
Some drives show similar behavior on IDE too.  It's less noticeable
because IDE is much quicker to downstep to PIO mode.  libata EH logic
definitely can use some improvements here.
I think the correct thing to do regarding command DMA filtering is to
follow what the other OS does.  Apparently, that's all ATAPI device
vendors test against.
Thanks.
