Is it caching when you do O_SYNC?

A raw device is something different than just /dev/sda1 - a raw device is
created with the 'raw' utility and is assigned /dev/raw or /dev/raw1. This
utility, and some documentation can be found on
     
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/sct/fs/raw-io/raw-19990728.tar.gz
AFAIK you don't need any patches anymore if you run 2.4 or a recent 2.3.
