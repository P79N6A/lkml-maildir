Hi out there,
I have a problem using my MO-Drive under kernel 2.4.3. I have several disks 
formated with a VFAT filesystem. Under kernel 2.2.19 everything works fine. 
Under kernel 2.4.3 I cannot write anything to the disk without hanging the 
complete system so that I have to use the reset button. For disks with an 
ext2 filesystem it works okay.
Regards
Detlev
