Hi,
I get the following kernel panic,
kernel BUG at arch/i386/mm/highmem.c:63!
EIP:    0060:[<c011af5a>]    Tainted: PF     VLI
EFLAGS: 00010006   (2.6.11-1.1369_FC4smp)
EIP is at kunmap_atomic+0x35/0x5f
The following is the code, I am using in my driver:
kmap_atomic code:
int hr_km_type = (in_interrupt())? KM_IRQ0: KM_USER0;
         pDataBuffer = kmap_atomic(cur_seg->page,
hr_km_type) + cur_seg->offset;
         if(pDataBuffer == NULL) {
            return (ENOMEM);
         }
kunmap_atomic code:
int hr_km_type = (in_interrupt())? KM_IRQ0: KM_USER0;
                  kunmap_atomic(pDataBuffer -
sg->offset, hr_km_type);
I am not using any locks like irq_disable/restore
before and after calling kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic.
The system has 1GB memory.
with regards,
   Anil
