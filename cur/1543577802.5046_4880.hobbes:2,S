As reported by Neil Booth, your patch contains errors which do not
appear in my patched system using my script.  You probably skipped the
leading '^' in the regexp.  It also turns out that there are a couple
of m68k assembler lines which have a trailing '#' which starts a
comment on that assembler.  So treat '#' as a comment marker as well.
Whatever you used, it was not my script.  It should be (with '#' added)
  find -type f -name '*.[chS]' | \
    xargs perl -lpi -e 's:^(\s*#\s*endif)\s+([^/\s#].*)$:\1\t/* \2 */:;'
BTW, until the patch is correct do not bother sending it to Alan Cox or
Linus, just to linux-kernel..
