I didn't want to 'blame the kernel' for the audio-skipping, I just
followed Andrew Morton's call for feedback. One of three things I find
annoying in 2.5/2.6 is the audio-skipping, as far as I remember it 'felt
better' with the late 2.2 to middle 2.4 kernels on older hardware.
But I also have to say that interactivity (with heavy multitasking, many
apps, massive window-moving etc. pp) on my desktop-system has improved
very very much compared to 2.4. Though I don't have figures to back that
:).

Yay, hd's have dma enabled (udma5). And Metacity is indeed a problem, it
is damn lagging behind most other window managers, but it's gnome2's
default.

ACK.
