First Hans let me remind you that this discussion is not XFS vs
reiser4. Christoph does a lot of reviewing and your child definitely
is in serious need of that to be mergeable. I'm sure Christoph is able
to review inpartially even when he is involved with other FS.

We already kind of have them, there are toolkits to do stackable FS with
the existing VFS.
However I suspect Hans is unwilling to redo his file system in this
point. While it looks quite unnecessary there might be other
areas which deserve more attention. In general all the code
needs review, even if it is not as controversal as the reinvented VFS.
