Right; I've been looking through all the journal_put_journal_head()
callers and most of the instances are places like journal_get_*_access,
which imply that the jh is still on a list.  The problem is races
against places like journal_unmap_buffer() where we can be removing the
bh from those lists as soon as we've lost the journal lock.

Quite.
I think I agree with Andrew here --- the only real solution is to make
sure that whenever anybody is clearing jh->b_transaction, they protect
themselves against journal_put_journal_head() by either elevating
j_count, or taking the jbd_lock_bh_journal_head() lock.
The current stop-gap may actually work, but I'd be more comfortable with
a robust scheme in place.
