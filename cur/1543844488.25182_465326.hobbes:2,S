Yes, it is.  However, the only solution I've invented so far is to print
that number in /proc/swaps, but that would be changing the
kernel-user interface quite badly ...

Not necessarily.  After creating the swap file the installer can bmap it
and figure out the offset from there (it will require some rescaling, but the
code for that is in mm/swapfile.c).

Well, if you don't delete it, it'll stay there. ;-)
The entire problem is we can't use file names during resume, because we can't
mount filesystems at that time, so we need to represent the swap header's
location in a filesystem-independent way.
