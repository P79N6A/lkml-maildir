The VFS-level open() code implements standard permission-checking so I
_think_ you don't need to do anything in here.  See how ramfs does it.
ramfs does have an inode_operations, for ->getattr() support.  So it can
return a correct number in stat->blocks.
sysfs implements inode_operations, so it can do stuff in ->setattr().
I don't think hypfs needs either of those, so you still shouldn't need a
file_inode_operations.
