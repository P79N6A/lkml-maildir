Right - apparently, some crud was lying about, causing weird problems
- it compiles now, and I can only apologize for my overly eager error
reports.  Although I'd suggest the compilation system could be
slightly more robust.
NTFS write support continues to be broken, however, 
ntfs_getuser_update_vm() refers to update_vm_cache(), which the linker 
can't seem to find.
