The EVMS team is announcing the next stable release of the Enterprise Volume 
Management System, which will eventually become EVMS 2.0. Package 1.1.0 is 
now available for download at the project web site:
http://www.sf.net/projects/evms
EVMS 1.1.0 has full support for the 2.4 kernel, and includes patches for most
kernels up to 2.4.19-rc3. It also has nearly full support for the 2.5 kernel, 
and includes patches for kernels 2.5.25 and 2.5.27.
**** Important Note ****
As of this release, EVMS has been assigned a new, permanent major number: 
117. The previous major number, 63, was reserved for experimental drivers. 
Before using 1.1.0, please read the README_Upgrade_To_1.1.0 file included in 
the source package for details on how you might be affected by the major 
number change. You can also view these instructions on the EVMS web site at 
http://evms.sourceforge.net/new_major.html.

      or convert an EVMS volume to compatibility.
  - Add-A-Feature
    - Adding a new feature to an existing EVMS volume.
  - Plug-in-specific tasks
    - Currently used by RAID-1, RAID-5, Snapshotting, and S/390 Seg. Mgr.
  - Progress Indicators
    - Plug-ins can use this to indicate progress of long-running operations.
