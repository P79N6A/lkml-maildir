           Summary: Problem with the /dev/ptmx file
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test2
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org

Distribution: Gentoo GNU/Linux
Hardware Environment: P4 2.0Ghz 512 mo ram, Ati Radeon 9000 Mobility
Software Environment: Linux 2.6.0-test2
Problem Description:
When i want to open an Eterm or an xterm (whatever until it uses a virtual
terminal) it fails saying granpt(4) failed.
I've traced the program and it seems that it calls /dev/ptmx well but that ptmx
doesn't create the right entry in /dev/pts.
Note : I don't have /dev/pts support in my kernel but it works with a 2.4 like
that... And i also tried with it compiled in and it didn't work either.
Steps to reproduce:
For me you only have to open something using a virtual terminal.
It may be a configuration problem but i searched and didn't find where it was...
