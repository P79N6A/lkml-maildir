While pondering this I have stumbled on a problem that rules out using a 
rotating list for implementing promotion.  The problem is that one of 
the requirements is that once a SCHED_NORMAL task is promoted to the 
MAX_RT_PRIO slot it stays there (as far as promotion is concerned). 
With the rotating list this isn't guaranteed and, in fact, any tasks 
that are in the MAX_RT_PRIO slot when promotion occurs will actually be 
demoted to IDLE_PRIO - 1.
Promotion should be a rare event as it is unnecessary if there's less 
than two tasks on the runqueue and when there are more than one task on 
the runqueue the interval between promotions increases linearly with the 
number of runnable tasks.  It is also an O(1) operation albeit with a 
constant factor determined by the number of occupied SCHED_NORMAL 
priority slots.
I will modify the code to take better advantage of the fact that 
promotion is not required when the number of runnable tasks is less than 
2 e.g. by resetting next_prom_due so that the first promotion after the 
number of runnable tasks exceeds 1 will only occur after a full 
promotion interval has expired.  At normal loads (and with sensible 
promotion interval settings i.e. greater than the time slice size) this 
should result in promotion never (or hardly ever) occurring and the 
overhead of do_promotions() will only have to be endured when it's 
absolutely necessary.
