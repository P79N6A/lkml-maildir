I'm just experimenting with git-apply for the forward case, and I'm
hitting a small problem.  I can do:
	cat patch | git-apply --stat
then I come to commit it:
	git commit -F -
but if I just use that, _all_ changes which happen to be in the tree
get committed, not just those which are in the index file.  Manually
doing each step of the commit is far too much work in perl...
Grumble.
And no, I'm not about to try to rewrite my patch database handling
using shell script - I don't know of any way to sanely access a mysql
database from shell.
I guess we'll just have to live with the screwed history until some
of the issues I've brought up with git are resolved (the biggest one
being git commit being able to take a list of files deleted.)
