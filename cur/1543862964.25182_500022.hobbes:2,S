The CPUID and MSR drivers need something like this.
HOWEVER -- and this is where things get gnarly -- the CPUID and MSR 
drivers would really like to be able to execute CPUID, WRMSR and RDMSR 
with the entire GPR register set (except the stack pointer) pre-set and 
post-captured, since it's highly likely that there are going to be 
nonstandard MSRs and CPUID levels (already witness Intel breaking the 
CPUID architecture by introducing %ecx dependencies.)
So I would like to see:
/* It probably makes sense to use the same structure on x86 and
    x86-64 */
struct x86_gpr_regs {
	u64 rax, rcx, rdx, rbx;
	u64 rsp, rbp, rsi, rdi;
	u64 r8, r9, r10, r11;
	u64 r12, r13, r14, r15;
};
void rdmsr_on_cpu(unsigned cpu,
	const struct x86_gpr_regs *in, struct x86_gpr_regs *out);
void wrmsr_on_cpu(unsigned cpu,
	const struct x86_gpr_regs *in, struct x86_gpr_regs *out);
void cpuid_on_cpu(unsigned cpu,
	const struct x86_gpr_regs *in, struct x86_gpr_regs *out);
This requires assembly to do in the nonparavirtualized case, of course. 
  I'll try to get that written up in the next day or so.
