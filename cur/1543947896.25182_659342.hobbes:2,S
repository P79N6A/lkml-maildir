shrink_page_list() would be expected to be passed pages pulled from
the active or inactive lists via isolate_lru_pages()?  I would not have
expected to find the kernel text on the LRU and therefore not expect to
see it passed to shrink_page_list()?
I would expect to find pages below the kernel text as real pages, and
potentially on the LRU on some architectures.  Which architecture are
you seeing this?  Which zones do the pages belong?
