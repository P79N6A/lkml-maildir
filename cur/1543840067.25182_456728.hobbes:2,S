Can you perhaps add a big "strategy" comment somewhere about
how those lazy schemes work?
I suppose some of those functions must be marked __kprobes

Isn't this sched_clock()?

Why does it have an own lock? Shouldn't the caller protect it already.
It must be because you don't prevent preemption for once.
The locking in general needs a big comment somewhere I think.

sched_clock(). And it can be expensive and you seem to do it redundandtly.
I would one do it once and pass down.

Is this really needed? On p4 you added hundreds of cycles now.
