 I have quoted some -- if you need more (I have left out all the 
non-allocatable sections for clarity):
$ mipsel-linux-readelf -S drivers/net/defxx.o
There are 26 section headers, starting at offset 0x3484:
Section Headers:

Key to Flags:
  W (write), A (alloc), X (execute), M (merge), S (strings)
  I (info), L (link order), G (group), x (unknown)
  O (extra OS processing required) o (OS specific), p (processor specific)
So with a quick calculation (`size' unfortunately gives confusing 
numbers): text is 10220 (init 1120, exit 236), data is 2044 and bss is 16 
bytes.  What you gain with this change is the space occupied by the 
.init.str1 section, worth 480 bytes, which would otherwise be resident.

 Arguably all the existing linker scripts should be made more consistent I 
suppose.  Currently all the {init,exit} annotations are handled separately 
by each architecture, so this would be no exception.  If you have a 
proposal as to how to do it cleanly, people will certainly appreciate it.

 Well, `modpost' should already be taking care of this -- __init_begin and 
__init_end are defined for this purpose.
