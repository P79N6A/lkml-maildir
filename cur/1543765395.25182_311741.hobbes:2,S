It still might. Ted and I are as yet unconvince that the Fortuna
approach is superior. While it may have some good properties, it lacks
some that random.c has, particularly robustness in the face of failure
of crypto primitives.

Duplicated code rarely does that.
At any rate, you ought to review the changes (there've been 40+
patches recently). There are a number of bug fixes in there and quite
a bit of cleanup. Syncookies in particular no longer live in random.c.
