And that's exactly how it will be done in fbsplash, as soon as I move
the rest of the 'silent'-handling code to the userspace. Fbsplash will 
call a userspace helper as soon as fbcon is initialized. The helper can 
be used put the console into KD_GRAPHICS mode and paint a full-screen 
picture to cover any text messages. Progress bars and other fancy stuff 
will be handled after init, by 100% userspace code (it's done that way 
even with the current version of fbsplash).
Live long and prosper.
