	Looks ok but can you test an extended version:
- remove these atomic_inc for cp and ct and the corresponding
__ip_vs_conn_put from ip_vs_conn_expire_now
- do the same for ip_vs_random_dropentry, it looks wrong in the same
way because it is not running anymore together with the connection 
expiration in same sltimer_handler
	Also, 2.4 needs the same changes, I hope you can continue?
