Two problems with the comparison:
  Port numbers can be collected into a 32 bit register in network
  byte order directly from the TCP packet without taking two 16 bit
  values and shifting and or'ing them.
  Worse: he folded the jenkins algorith result with
   h ^= h >> 16;
   h ^= h >> 8;
  Destroying the coverage of the function.
I, for one, am not suprised that artifacts appeared in the comparison
as a result of this destruction of the coverage of the hashing function.
