I have ported my "kernel-user space shared virtual memory driver" to 2.2
kernel. It is available at
http://crds.chemie.unibas.ch/PCI-MIO-E/mbuff-0.5.tar.gz
It is a character device implementing mmap method on vmalloc'ed kernel memory
(any size). It is based on "heavy wizardry" in bttv.c driver which can be now
used by normal people as well ;-)
