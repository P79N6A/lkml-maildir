While working on this area, shouldn't we just finally get rid of the
bogus ETH_ZLEN padding? There is no such requirement for IEEE 802.11.
This would remove need for the extra padding code you have in
hermes_bap_pwrite_pad(). The only requirement is to be able to add one
extra byte if the packet length is odd.
