Ok, here I am again, sorry for not being able to react on 
your patches this weekend...
I tested your latest patches with a 2.4.9-ac18 kernels, and,
surprise, the kernel now boots correctly, _without_ any
pnpbios* boot option.
Since the DMI / PNP order was not modified as of ac18, I
suppose the patches change something else which makes it
work...
Stelian.
