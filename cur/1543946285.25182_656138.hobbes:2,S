Quick answer: No.
The VINETIC-CPE (PEB3332EL) is doing the analog voice processing and
needs DSP firmware as well as device drivers provided by Infineon.
I don't think you will get this stuff from Infineon easily.
But you can try to extract it from the current D-link firmware.
YMMV.
I could ask a friend who is working on the DSL-Chipsets at Infineon
about their code/driver policy/availability. Ping me off-list in 2 weeks,
he is on holiday right now.
