OK, so there's a way for the administrator to tune this. I note the
default on my system is 1024, which should be fine for most
applications. However, for a busy WWW server, how deep should the
queue be? Anyone got a benchmark?
Assuming you need a much deeper queue (4096 for example), then tuning
rtsig-max will work, but at the cost of increasing the queue depth for
all processes, most of which won't need it. So how about creating
rtsig-limit and adding a command to prctl(2), so that a process which
needs to increase the queue depth can do so (up to the sysadmin tuned
limit), but other processes use the default?
