Why do RedHat claim there is then?

{Shrug} Persuade RedHat of that, not me - they're the ones who release
it separately. Taken directly from RedHat's FTP site, I note that Red
Hat 6.2 includes RPM's for both mount-2.10f-1.i386.rpm and
util-linux-2.10f-7.i386.rpm which, whilst different releases of the
same version, is sufficient to prove your argument false. I can't get
into their 7.0 tree atm to check due to network congestion, so can't
comment on that...

{Shrug} Thinking isn't sufficient - check your facts.

I tried the version that came as part of Red Hat 6.2 as installed
unmodified on the system I'm using. According to the rpm command, I
see...
 Q> $ rpm -qf `which loadkeys`
 Q> console-tools-19990829-10
 Q> $
I've now tried that on FOUR different systems running Red Hat 6.2, the
last of them a fresh install direct from genuine RH 6.2 CD's with NO
changes since, and all four report the same and do exactly the same to
the command in ver_linux so I have to assume that the command in
ver_linux is UNABLE to determine a version number with this release of
Linux.
Best wishes from Riley.
