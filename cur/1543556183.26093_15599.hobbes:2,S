Block number 461706 is about the last block on the tape. So you probably hit
end of media. The end of tape processing in ide-tape.c doesn'y seem to
be quit robust yet.
I ran into such problems since februari or so and have been in contact with
the ide-tape developers and Onstream about it. 
I recently volunteered to try improving the end of media handling (basicly by
implementing early warning EOM) but so far have not had much time to work on it...
