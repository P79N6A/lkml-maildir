Sure I think you could do it with some effort. They were primarily 
designed for user space. Lots of little side issues where surprises await 
you. I think Lee documented many of them. See the recent mm commits.

The context switch is needed at some point anyways to get the new process 
running on the new CPU? Just do it before allocating structures. That way 
the potential memory policy and cpuset context is preserved and followed.

I would think that the forking process has to wait on completion anyways
and get an error code.

Lets hope that the simpler process is really simpler after all the corner 
cases have been dealt with.
