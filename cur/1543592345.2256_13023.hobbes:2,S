Nope. Its been policy since 2.0. Its both v4l1 and v4l2 policy. In fact its
fairly nonsensical to handle any format conversions in kernel unless the
device outputs a unique format of its own.
It breaks apps by doing conversions, and it breaks important apps like H263
codecs not silly little camera viewers, because you trash the performance
