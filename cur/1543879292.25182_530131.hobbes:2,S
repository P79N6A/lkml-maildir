OK, so there are 2 options: 1) fix 100 spots or 2) ... ;-)

I'm not a linux scheduler expert, but I don't understand this. Suppose 2 extreme situations:
1) I have full time slices and call yield, going to the expired list with again full times slices; this is IMHO a NOOP, i.e. fair.
2) I have only a single slice left, NOT yielding would get me to the expired list via scheduler_tick the next timer interrupt and I would get my full time slice quota. DO YIELD at that moment, will give me full time slice quota again (with my proposal).

Again, agreed, but this tight loop would run in code cache completely. We could call it O(1.1) ;-) With a duffs device it would mean a few clock cycles per position.

That could already solve your concern from above. Statistically speaking, it will give them (benchmarkers) the smoothest curve they've ever seen.
Please be aware that I'm just exploring options/insight here. It is not something I intend to push inside the mainline kernel. I just want to find reasonable and logic criticism as you and some others have provided already. Thanks for that!
