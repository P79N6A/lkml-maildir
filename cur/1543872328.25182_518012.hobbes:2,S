Works for me too. Using a 512mb SD card, and a 256miniSD in an adaptor.
Managed to mount both SD cards and play mp3's off each with mpg321.
Literally music to my ears. I used the 0.1 release on the homepage, so
it still oopsed on removal when I hadnt unmounted.
Laptop is an Acer Travelmate 370 for the record.
