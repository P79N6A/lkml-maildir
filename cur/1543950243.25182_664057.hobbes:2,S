FWIW I don't think it's a release blocker for 4.3.0.  The error is arcane 
and happens seldomly if at all.  And only on unfixed kernels.  A program 
needs to do std explicitely, which most don't do _and_ get hit by a signal 
while begin in a std region.  This happens so seldom that it didn't occur 
in building the next openSuSE 11.0, and it continually builds packages 
with 4.3 since months.
It should be worked around in 4.3.1 if at all.
Ciao,
Michael.
