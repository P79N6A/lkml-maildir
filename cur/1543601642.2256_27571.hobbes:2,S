Well, in recent versions of e2fsprogs it prefers to check /proc/mounts
over /etc/mtab to determine if a device is in-use, because the latter
can be incorrect after a crash, and the root filesystem is read-only at
this time.  There was recently a bug report about this from Slackware
users, where fsck is run on all of the filesystems before root is
remounted rw.  As a result, there is now even extra checking to see if
the devno of the mountpoint == devno of the device, otherwise it assumes
the /etc/mtab entry is bogus.
On most other systems, root is remounted rw before non-root filesystems
are checked, and /etc/mtab could be assumed to be correct, but it will
never be checked if /proc/mounts exists.
Cheers, Andreas
