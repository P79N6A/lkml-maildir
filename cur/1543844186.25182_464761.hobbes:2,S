I've started looking in that direction.  First shot could just be
tracking kernel memory consumption w/o worrying about whether it is slab
or PT etc.  Hopefully next patchset will have that support integrated.

I think the current set of changes (and tracking of different
components) is necessary for memory handler to do the right thing.  Plus
it is possible that user land management tools can also make use of this
information.

That is great to know. Thanks.  Hopefully it is getting enough coverage
to get there.
