Right, it's buggered on Red Hat's kernel. Not really a problem; they
have a bugzilla and it's not big deal to redirect users there.
Actually what I'd really like is for the Red Hat people to backport the
patch. It shouldn't be too hard.
This doesn't change the situation for users on other 2.4 kernels, of
course. But sys_call_table is still there for them.
