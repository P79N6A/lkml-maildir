Ok, this one applied okay for me. It still does not seem to work:
pavel@amd:/data/l/linux$ scripts/miniconfig.sh config.ok
Calculating mini.config...
pavel@amd:/data/l/linux$ cat mini.config
CONFIG_PM=y
pavel@amd:/data/l/linux$ 
...and yes, my config is definitely more complex than that, I
handselected only relevant PCI cards, for example.
