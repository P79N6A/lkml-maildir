Oh God, please indent code examples, and if your email client strips white
space, change your email client.

I assume that the signal_pending is the if result and not the schedule.
Since there was no indentation I couldn't tell.

Before I go to your questions, I'll first answer that this _is_ buggy
code.  If the condition is checked and you are woken up between the
while (!condition) and the set_current_state, then you will end up
sleeping forever or until someone sends you a signal.

Yes, and then put it again after schedule.

Yes, I would put the signal_pending check after the schedule (as most of
the kernel does this).

Yeah, so?  There's no harm in that, except for an extra cpu cycles that
are done to wake it up.  That, I wouldn't change.

BTW, this is not an IRC, we use normal capitalization and normal spelling
(when we know how to spell a word ;-).  So the next time you send to the
list, send it as if you were writing a serious letter, or you may just be
ignored. (as you might have been if I didn't respond).
