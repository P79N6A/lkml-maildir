I made it to boot some minute ago and I am writing this on 2.3.22:

;). I can't diff my current tree now as it's bloated by unreadable stuff,
and in my tree only half of the pci stuff is fixed. Now the detection (and
the handling of the second pci bus) works fine but I completly disabled
the reassign stuff and I am going with the plain SRM PCI settings.
Hopefully I'll fix the rest and I'll have a real patch RSN.
