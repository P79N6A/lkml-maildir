You would think. But that's something that the Linux kernel should expect.
This can happen on a system where it's not no RT, but more soft RT (God I
hate that term). Meaning, the "optimization" of running softirqs as
threads can actually cause longer latencies to the interrupt. Since any
time an RT task preempts the IRQ while running bounded to a CPU, it will
be like masking that interrupt for the full time the RT task is running.

This can't always be done. Say you only have two CPUS, and there's two RT
tasks that run at high priorities, on each. But it could be period that
the two don't always run at the same time. You don't want to stop
an IRQ when it gets preempted by one of the RT tasks.
So my answer to you is, no, it is not just a misconfiguration of the
system. By making an optimization, we just added a latency that would not
be there without that optimization. And it wouldn't be something that one
would expect.
