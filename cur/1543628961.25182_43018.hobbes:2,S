Subject: GW Solo 5350 Laptop APIC trouble?

I'm running 2.4.18 on my GW Solo 5350, and if I compile APIC in for
uniprocessors, it will fail pretty horribly - something like this:
APIC + APM: System Freeze on idle, random time, instant Fn key freeze.
APIC + ACPI: System Freeze when using Fn key with smm feature.
APM w/o APIC: Works fine, but Fn key instant on-screen status info is
corrupt
ACPI w/o APIC: Haven't tried yet.
Redhat 7.2 Kernel (2.4.9-RH I believe): No crashes, Fn-key onscreen works
fine.
(smm=system management mode)
I'm still trying to figure out what's in the RH kernel that makes it work
fine, that's when I found out compiling in APIC aggravated the failures.
Apparently ACPI can't read battery info from the laptop yet.  Or at least
I haven't figured out a way to do so yet...
Anyone have any ideas how to start debugging this?  Chances are it's a
hardware issue, I hope it can be worked around in software without
outrightly disabling or not using the features.
Thanks,
