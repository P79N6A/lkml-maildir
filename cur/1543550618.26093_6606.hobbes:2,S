I sent this to the maintainer of the ppa driver some time ago, and have
received no response.
Please CC me on replies, I'm not on the list.

Subject: ppa driver failure in 2.4.0-test8
I have a relatively old ZIP drive (well back into the ppa era).  I
recently upgraded to 2.4.0-test8 from 2.4.0-test7, and the ppa driver
now no longer seems to work properly.
When I load the drier, the following gets put in the syslog:
kernel: ppa: Version 2.05 (for Linux 2.2.x) 
kernel: ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use EPP 32 bit 
kernel: ppa: Communication established with ID 6 using EPP 32 bit 
kernel: scsi1 : Iomega VPI0 (ppa) interface 
kernel: scsi : 2 hosts. 
At this point, the system hangs up pretty bad.  Alt-PrtScn stuff to set
the console log level reveals that there is an infinite series of
"Detected scsi disk sdXX", where it keeps incrementing the XX through
all the letters, and into punctuation, etc.

You can't have everything.  Where would you put it?
