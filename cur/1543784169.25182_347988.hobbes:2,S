Each process that make a request is put to sleep until the request has been answered by the dameon. A couple of days of development. A bit more in your case due to the fake PCI bridge (yes, I have implemented one of those as well for cardbus).

Can you send me or post your code?
This code can be a good starting point for us.
Thanks
