  Now that's very confusing.   So in order to enable something under the 
Character devices menu you need to 1st enable something under "Input 
device support".   Which for some reason is configured as a module?  It 
says something that I resorted to editing .config by hand.
   Is it too much to ask to make the defaults give us a working 
console?  Otherwise we will be answering the question of "why does 
screen go blank after uncompressing" for the entire 2.6 cycle!!  The 
number of people who don't want to enable config_vt is fairly small, and 
they will be wanting to remove a number of our defaults any way.
