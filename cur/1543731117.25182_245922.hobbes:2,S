That bus also contains other stuffs, I'd prefer the in-kernel specific
driver for this model to be used rather than some generic stuff.

It was wrong to check on the bus number like that. i2c-keywest is used
on a variety of models to driver totally different i2c busses, and at
this point, we can't arbitrarily say "bus 1 is HW monitoring". It
totally depends on the machine model. Besides, I don't like generic
drivers playing with those thermal control stuffs, I prefer drivers that
have been tuned for those specific machine models.

As I wrote earlier. Just testing the bus number and arbitrarily deciding
bus 1 is HWMON makes no sense.
