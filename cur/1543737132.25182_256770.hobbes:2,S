It is indeed the other way around, the clock skew occurs on some Mobos
with timer interrupts routed to the IntIn0 and to my knowledge is not evident
in the ExtInt routing mode.
The downside of using the ExtInt routing mode is that you can no longer use
nmi_watchdog=1 because it only works on nforce2 boards with IntIn0 timer routing.

An earlier Thread on the Topic of the time skew with I/O Apic routing:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2004-01/3129.html
A couple of Skewing Mobos Involved:
Abit NF7-S V2.0 motherboard. 
A7N8X Deluxe mobo/Athlon
Maybe they are using the same revision of non GPU nforce2 silicon?
I personally never had any clock skew but I have only used Mobos with graphics
onboard, several Albatron KM18G and an Epox 8RGA+
