... because I never linked against gcrt0.o. I never used -pg with the
linker. I used it only with the compiler and I feed to the linker my own
mcount() btw.

Because the ITIMER_PROF is simply invoked by the timer interrupt when
happens while the current process is the profiled one.
In select() the profiled process sleeps so it will never be the current
process and it will never get the SIGPROF from the ITIMER_PROF.

Yes, you can use the ITIMER_REAL which sends a SIGALARM. Inside the
SIGALARM callback raise(SIGPROF). I don't know if this is what you want
but doing this will interrupt select to run the signal handler for sure ;).
