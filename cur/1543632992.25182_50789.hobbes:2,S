Subject: lk-changelog.pl now to parse bk changes - output

Hi,
I released lk-changelog.pl v0.26, my changelog reformatter, which does
parse the "bk changes" output format (this was reported by Marcelo
Tosatti) and not only the format of the BK-kernel-tools/changelog script
(which Linus uses).
I'm not pasting my program this time, as the next version is supposed to
pull the log out of bitkeeper itself.
Find v0.26 at
