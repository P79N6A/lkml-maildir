Willy,
could you check whether your current v18 CFS tree has the fix below 
included? I discovered it right after having released v18 so i updated 
the v18 files in place - but maybe you downloaded an early version? I 
thought it's relatively harmless, that it would only affect SCHED_IDLE 
tasks, but maybe it affects nice +19 tasks too on your box!
