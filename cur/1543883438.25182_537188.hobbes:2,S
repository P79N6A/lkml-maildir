Sounds like the sis900 network driver problem.

You never explained what the problem even was, apart from compiling in 
some code that you didn't need to before. Didn't it work in the end?
If it worked, I don't see what the big issue was. You are getting a _lot_ 
of other code in the kernel that you probably never use, you may not even 
have realized.
Uwe, you really aren't helping yourself by being so damn abrasive. I know 
for a fact that your bug-reports are going ignored by some people, and I'm 
not surprised at all.
