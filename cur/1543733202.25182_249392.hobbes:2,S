OK, now I have an ordering problem.  If I understand you correctly, this
patch fixes a ppc problem which was introduced by a patch from the bk-ia64
tree, yes?
If so, my options are to ask Tony to add this patch to the bk-ia64 tree so
they all go in at the same time, or to merge this patch into Linus's tree
prior to the ia64 patch.  To do the latter, I'd need confirmation that your
patch is safe against current -linus.  Can you please confirm this?
