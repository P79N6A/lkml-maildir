The easiest way to do this will be to wait until some planned updates 
are added to the PM core; then this will be a quick and simple change.  
That probably means waiting until after 2.6.25 is released, however.

That could go in along with the previous change.  The PM update
mentioned above involves adding a "suspended" flag to every struct 
device.  With that available, this amounts to nothing more than an 
extra test added at the beginning of mmc_rescan().
