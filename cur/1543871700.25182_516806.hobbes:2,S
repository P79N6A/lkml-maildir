Subject: [PATCH 1/1] hotplug cpu: migrate a task within its cpuset
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Cliff Wickman <cpw@sgi.com>
When a cpu is disabled, move_task_off_dead_cpu() is called for tasks
that have been running on that cpu.
Currently, such a task is migrated:
 1) to any cpu on the same node as the disabled cpu, which is both online
    and among that task's cpus_allowed
 2) to any cpu which is both online and among that task's cpus_allowed
But the task's cpus_allowed may have been a single cpu.
This patch would insert a preference to migrate such a task to a cpu within
its cpuset (and set its cpus_allowed to its cpuset).
With this patch, migrate the task to:
 1) to any cpu on the same node as the disabled cpu, which is both online
    and among that task's cpus_allowed
 2) to any online cpu within the task's cpuset
 3) to any cpu which is both online and among that task's cpus_allowed
Diffed against 2.6.16.37
