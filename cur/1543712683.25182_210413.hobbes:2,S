It can't be made specific. It's a rather unfortunate fact of life that
various arches require magic toolchain versions to produce working
kernels. The bits about dragging this around in front of arch maintainers
is to figure out whether the magic toolchain versions required for the
various arches barf on the constructs you're using.

I think it's feasible to get the requirement lifted. You just need to
(once again) run it past arch maintainers.

Maybe so. The requirements were actually three competing/conflicting
requirements: one from Ray Bryant/SGI for call-by-reference semantics
available to core API's, one from davem for call-by-value on arithmetic
types in core API's. There was another imposed for zero indirection on
small SMP systems you're probably going to have to work harder to get
an ack on since I don't remember where it came from apart from "on high".
But it sounds like at least one of the requirement competitors may be
backing out here. If Ray or other vaguely independent SGI ppl (yes, this
does need to look like it's more than unilateral) could speak up
regarding the call-by-reference semantics requirement that would lift a
third of it. The unwrapped structures was basically davem and tinyboxen,
and I saw the bit where he lifted the sparc(64) side of that requirement.
As I see it we have:
(a) pester more ppl at SGI to get cpumask_const_t requirements dropped
(b) davem's already backed off cpumask_arith for sparc(32|64) ABI bits
(c) some kind of high-level ack is needed for indirection on tinyboxen
	to kill off the second requirement for cpumask_arith
(d) run this past arch maintainers for acks wrt. compiler versions vs.
	the costructs you're using in inlines
(a) should be very easy for you, (b) is fait accompli, (c) akpm could
chime in on at any moment. One hopeful thing here for you is that it's
a question of asking the right ppl; the code itself is largely a non-
issue, apart from whether higher-level maintainers regard it as
excessive code churn or too cleanup-heavy.
I'll send a private reply about how to get a hold of arch maintainers,
which should take care of (d).
(davem please don't shoot me -- this stuff could break things otherwise
similar to how i386 hit bad codegen in earlier revisions pre-merge)
