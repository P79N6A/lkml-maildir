Dear diary, on Wed, Apr 13, 2005 at 11:25:04AM CEST, I got a letter

It's fine to share the objects database. If you want to share the
directory cache, you are doing something wrong, though. What do you need
it for?

I'm working on that right now. (Well, I wish I would, if other things
didn't keep distracting me.)
The idea is to have a command which will do something like:
	mkdir .git
	ln -s $origtree/heads $origtree/objects $origtree/tags .git
	cp $origtree/HEAD .git
	cd ..
	read-tree $(tree-id)
Voila. Now you have a new tree with almost no current neither future
overhead.
This will be used to do the out-tree merges. Command for user to do this
will likely also make it a regular branch, doing
	ln -s $(realpath git/HEAD) .git/heads/branchname
so that you can reference to it easily from your other branches.
Would this do what you want?

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
