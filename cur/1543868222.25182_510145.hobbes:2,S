Right, that was my point. If the MTD API in the kernel is not flawed, why
do we need the 'native' UBI interface? Just merge gluebi into UBI and
get rid of the extra abstraction.

While probably all modern SD cards have some amount of wear leveling
built in, I wouldn't want to rely on that for anything but the simple
large-file-on-fatfs (jpeg or mp3) case. Using UBI on top of the
native wear-leveling sounds like the right solution.

Not on a 4GB SD medium, with the current jffs2 version. The problem
is that jffs2 doesn't scale that well, so you want a different fs.
Since logfs isn't stable yet, you end up with something like ext3,
which in turn means that you need a UBI-like concept to avoid
wearing out the blocks that store your metadata.
