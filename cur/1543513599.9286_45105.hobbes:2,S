Linus,
Attached is a patch against 2.3.23 pre5 which adds 'kphysaddr_t' type.
The idea is to migrate code to using this type to store physical
addresses.  This will help flag problematic iomap code via a warning --
since a lot of code uses char* instead of long to store physical
addresses.  Also, IMHO it would be nice if the source code told us it
was storing a physical address, via the C type system.  (same idea as
kdev_t, etc.)
Regards,
