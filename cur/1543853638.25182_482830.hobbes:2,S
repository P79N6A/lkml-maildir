Compiling the program which uses a lot "sysctl" syscalls, gives me this 
warning on Debian unstable:
"warning: the `sysctl' syscall has been removed from 2.6.18+ kernels, 
direct access to `/proc/sys' should be used instead."
Is it true? And what can be used as alternative which would work with both 
2.4 and 2.6 kernels and would work with capabilities (sys/capability.h)?
Accessing `/proc/sys' directly isn't such alternative as it doesn't work 
with capabilities.
