Ho hum, it is tricky :-)))
At bio_map_user() you need to see the user's most recent write
to the page if you are going "user --> device".  So if "user
--> device" bio_map_user() must flush_dcache_page().
I find the write_to_vm condition confusion which is probably why
I am sitting here spelling this out :-)
At bio_unmap_user(), if we are going "device --> user" you have
to flush_dcache_page().  And actually, this flush could just as
legitimately occur at bio_map_user() time.
Therefore, the easiest thing to do is always flush_dcache_page()
at bio_map_user().
All the other cases are going to be like this, so we might as
well cut to the chase and flush_dcache_page() for all the pages
inside of get_user_pages().
Whoever made get_user_pages() and didn't carry over the
flush_dcache_page calls from the mechanism it is meant to replace
should be spanked :-)
