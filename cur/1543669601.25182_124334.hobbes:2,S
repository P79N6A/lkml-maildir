You think you are kidding? The main hard disk on one of our VAX/11-750
was belt-driven. I think it was a RA50?? Anyway, it consisted of
a 55 pound sealed aluminum casting with fins (HDA), that a technician
would roll in using a refrigerator dolly. It had a pulley on it's
bottom that was fit into a belt to spin it up. The motor sounded
like a vacuum-cleaner motor, probably made by Hoover.
Wmmm.
$ ls /  # "DIR"
%DIRECT-W-NOFILES, no files found
Remember versioned files? What would Unix do with....
$ renam *.*;* *.*;1
$ ls
  *.*;1
$
You get left with one file called *.*;1  -- nice!
I did like....
$ set proc/priv=all
$ @sys$system:shutdown
It was almost as amazing as `init 0` on Red-Hat distributions....
