I'm unsure about community drivers but...
qlogic does have driver source available on their site for the qla2200 and
qla2300 which does include fail over code.  The 6.03 is
also supported under Red Hat AS2.1 and Suse 7.? or 8 by EMC, perhaps
even using RH 7.? at sometime in the near future.
I have tried it and it does work very well, although the timeout for
failover is hard coded and there may be an issue with tape drives if
failover is enabled...  I'll know more about that later this coming week.
