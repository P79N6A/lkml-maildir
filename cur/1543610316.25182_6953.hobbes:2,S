Not in this case, it is because after 'su -' userland tries to
set the RLIMIT_FSIZE to unlimited with with the constant
0x7fffffff which is different from the one kernel uses internal
0xffffffff (see 
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0111.1/0036.html
 and all next messages).
If this is more a gnulib or kernel mistake ? I don't know, but
the kernel uses sys_old_getrlimit and gives 0x7fffffff back to userland.
I think in this case the kernel should do the same in the other direction
(leafing a hole form 0x7fffffff to 0xffffffff where you could not set
the FSIZE).
Cheers,
 Peter
