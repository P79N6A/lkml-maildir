Why do you consider it a mess, and what reason did you see?
The jsm driver is an effort where people like Wen Xiong, Al Viro and me
put in a lot of effort to make the piece of crap the digi driver was into
something almost sane.  Now we should limit it to a tiny subset of the
supported hardware just because digi is full of crack?

While Scott wrote most of the original code that ended up in the jsm driver
he's certainly not the maintainer in any sense.

But the original code isn't technically suitable.

Because a config option is totally pointless.  If Scott wants someone to
use his driver he can that person to simply load that driver, there's
absolutely no reason for us to cripple our drivers because some vendor
has out of tree drivers.  We don't remove support for card from tg3 just
because Broadcom would prefer us to use their bcm5700 driver, or remove
support for cards from the 3c59x driver just because 3com has a driver of
their own for a few of those cards.
