You say that you must panic system if TPM is not acessible during
bootup. That smells just plain wrong. If I want to trick secure
managment point, what prevents me from booting kernel in "test" mode,
and then lie about it?

No; with your current system, it only means I may not place my rootkit
into executable file. I can still place my evil rootkit into shell
script and/or config file.
