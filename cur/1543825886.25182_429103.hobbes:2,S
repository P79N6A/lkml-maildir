See section 7.2.1 of the USB 2.0 specification (p. 177):
	Devices must also ensure that the maximum operating current drawn 
	by a device is one unit load, until configured.
Note that a unit load is defined as to be 100 mA.  This is a requirement, 
not a recommendation.

On that same page the specification says:
	Bus-powered hubs: Draw all of their power for any internal
	functions and downstream facing ports from VBUS on the hub s
	upstream facing port.  Bus-powered hubs may only draw up to one
	unit load upon power-up and five unit loads after configuration.
	The configuration power is split between allocations to the hub,
	any non-removable functions and the external ports. External ports
	in a bus-powered hub can supply only one unit load per port
	regardless of the current draw on the other ports of that hub.
This clearly states that a bus-powered hub cannot supply 200 mA on one
port, even if another port is unoccupied.
