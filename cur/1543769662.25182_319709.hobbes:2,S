Right.  For instance, before I found the 1000 HZ patch for the 2.4
kernel I would set the RTC to tick 1024 times a second, and then add
that FD to my select() fd-sets.  That causes select to return after about
1ms, and I could do this in a loop to get the X ms of sleep that I needed.
This is not as nice as having a clean 1ms tick clock, but it's a hell of
a lot better than a full busy spin...
