What is the nature of this jobs that you are running?
1) Just the continuous computations from the user land
2) computations mixed with some system calls, i/o or some other of sleep
wakeups.
My guess at this moment is that it is the former one. With that kind of
a load, one can easily get stuck in this "bad" situation with 2 jobs
running on the same package. And as these processes doesn't sleep or get
scheduled out, they continue to run on the same CPUs, mostly trying to
use any cache affinity in those CPUs.
2.4.20 has code in place to take care of load as in 2 above. When trying
to find the best CPU to schedule in a process (while waking up from
sleep), it actually looks at idle package v/s idle logical processor.
Thanks,
