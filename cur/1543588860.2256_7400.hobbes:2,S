No. Think instead of blindly following existing implementation
	socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
	connect("/var/run/mailservice");
	write("GIMMEMYMAIL\n");
	read("200 CATCH..");
	read(all my mail)
The daemon needs no priviledge. The client needs no priviledge. The 
PEERCRED authentication on AF_UNIX sockets does the work. I can even pass you
back the file handle of the mailbox if I was using an old style non database
indexed mail spool.

You are doing a lot more exec() calls that way. If you get enough mail
to make spool space an issue you want a daemon.
