Signed-off-by: should imply Tested-by:, with the exception of the final 
Signed-off-by: when it's merged into a tree. Tested-by:, if it really is 
necessary or useful, should be reserved for only those who test something 
but weren't involved in its development. Adding it to the tag is 
unnecessary unless somebody thinks there's a serious problem with untested 
patches being introduced by first-hand maintainers that a forced reminder 
would remedy.
