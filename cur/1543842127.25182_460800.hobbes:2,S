Subject: Wrong free space reported for XFS filesystem

For your information;
I've been running a bunch of benchmarks on a 250GB XFS filesystem.
After the benchmarks had run for a few hours and almost filled up the
fs, I removed all the files and did a "df -h" with interresting
results :
/dev/mapper/Data1-test
                     250G  -64Z  251G 101% /mnt/test
"df -k"  reported this :
/dev/mapper/Data1-test
                     262144000 -73786976294838202960 262147504 101% /mnt/test
I then did an umount and remount of the filesystem and then things
look more sane :
"df -h" :
/dev/mapper/Data1-test
                      250G  126M  250G   1% /mnt/test
"df -k" :
/dev/mapper/Data1-test
                     262144000    128280 262015720   1% /mnt/test
The filesystem is mounted like this :
/dev/mapper/Data1-test on /mnt/test type xfs
(rw,noatime,ihashsize=64433,logdev=/dev/Log1/test_log,usrquota)
