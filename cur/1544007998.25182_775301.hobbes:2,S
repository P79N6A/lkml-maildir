Subject: [PATCH 1/6] cpumask: make CONFIG_NR_CPUS always valid.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/1/43

Impact: cleanup
Currently we have NR_CPUS, which is 1 on UP, and CONFIG_NR_CPUS on
SMP.  If we make CONFIG_NR_CPUS always valid (and always 1 on !SMP),
we can skip the middleman.
This also allows us to find and check all the remaining NR_CPUS users.
To avoid breaking every arch, we cheat and do this for the moment
in the header if the arch doesn't.
