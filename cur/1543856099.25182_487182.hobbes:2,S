Subject: [patch]VMSPLIT_2G conflicts with PAE

PAGE_OFFSET is 0x78000000 with VMSPLIT_2G, this address is in the middle
of the second pgd entry with pae enabled. This breaks assumptions
(address is aligned to pgd entry's address) in a lot of places like
pagetable_init. Fixing the assumptions is hard (eg, low mapping). SO I
just changed the address to 0x80000000.
