Hello everyone,
today I compiled the newest kernel (2.6.22.1 from kernel.org) and installed it into the system.
With the older builds it took about 3...4 days to get an Oops. So we have to be a little patient, I'm afraid.
If there are any news I will let you know.
Thank you all for your help!
Wish you a nice weekend!
Bye
Stefan

Yes, please try with 2.6.22.1 to make sure that the problem persists,
before we go hunting solved problems.
Thanks,
