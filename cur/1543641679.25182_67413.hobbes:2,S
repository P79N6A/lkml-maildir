   No, but using serport.c, you can bind a serio to a tty via a line
   discipline, for example if you want a PC serial mouse on /dev/ttyS0 to
   talk to sermouse.c via serio. I don't like the approach much, I hope(d) we
   could switch somewhere below the tty layer, but it sort of works, and
   maybe will have the bugs fixed sooner or later.
So how about this:
1) When SERIO device is claimed, we fail of TTY copy is opened
   by any user.
2) Once we allow SERIO device to be claimed, we prevent opens
   of TTY copy.
I guess this is sort of what Russell is recommending.
