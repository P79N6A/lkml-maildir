Well, for values of "shortly" in months in most cases. These are 
consumer goods, I would not expect units with consecutive serial numbers 
to fail separated by such a short time that you can't do a backup and/or 
replace and rebuild. If quality control were so good they are likely to 
fail at the same time it would be so good they would be obsolete before 
they failed.
That urban myth is a good reason to do backups, but a bad reason to 
avoid RAID.
