one could do that but it's not optimal; if the process DOES get waken up
earlier, it should take the interrupt then immediately, so that it
doesn't have to wake up again when the timer fires. 
(in fact it would be nice if the guest could somehow poll at the irq
mask at waking from idle, so that it wouldn't need a vmexit/entry for
every such interrupt, but just do the right thing for all pending work)
In addition, yes it'll be a helper function, but since all drivers will
want the functionality its probably best off in the generic code
