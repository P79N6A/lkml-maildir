It's a bad sign that this question is flowing in the you->me direction ;)
I don't see anywhere under slab_destroy() where *cachep state gets altered.
The change did cause
free_block->slab_destroy->__cache_free->cache_free_alien to no longer be
called under this slab's l3->list_lock.  Maybe that locking is
(accidentally?) protecting something?
