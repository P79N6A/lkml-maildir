I think it will be a really big win on quite low speed machines streaming
at eg set top box speeds, without much memory (eg your Tivo).
O_DIRECT needs at least 4M reads to overcome lack of readahead,
so is only really useful if you are doing really big stuff (eg
uncompressed video). It is possible that O_STREAMING will be just as
good as this however, becasue there are latency issues with O_DIRECT
(you really need aio or multiple threads to sustain good readahead,
one test of mine needed 8 threads for optimal performance). I have
a bunch of things I could retest with O_STREAMING and large readahead.
O_DIRECT is always going to win for random access stuff though. It is
good to have a choice.
