Feel free to ignore all of my reply; please note that I am not trying to "be 
right" or to "be wrong" but I still do not understand ... Thank you still for 
your time and pedagogy.

The point I fail to understand is the following : you know the enciphered 
value of these 1-3bits. But how can you know what is 
compressed-but-deciphered 1-3bit value ? Ok my text contains only 0s. OK 
these 0s appear to be "011" once encrypted. How do you launch your 
dictionnary attack ? You do _not_ (?) know what the 3bit deciphered code for 
"0" is. Or maybe you do ?

Maybe my "endless" story is absurd, but I am _not_ protecting against weak 
keys; I am trying to protected against weak _data_ , which is the basis for 
dictionnary attacks even in the case of perfectly random keys.
Thank you for having read till here,
Guillaume.
