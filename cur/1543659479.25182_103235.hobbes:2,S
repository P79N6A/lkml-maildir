Hi Alan,
Configure.help in 2.2 appearss, er, "misleading" re the implications of
CONFIG_NET_RADIO as selecting CONFIG_NET_RADIO (at least) includes the
/proc/net/wireless stuff in net/core/dev.c. Appended patch lifts
apparently more correct text from 2.4.
Lastly, both 2.2 and 2.4 refer to 
ftp://shadow.cabi.net/pub/Linux
 - AFAICS
shadow.cabi.net no longer exists.  I presume this should be
updated/dropped too?
Regards,
Neale.

 CONFIG_NET_RADIO
   Support for wireless LANs and everything having to do with radio,

+  Saying Y here also enables the Wireless Extensions (creates
+  /proc/net/wireless and enables ifconfig access). The Wireless
+  Extension is a generic API allowing a driver to expose to the user
+  space configuration and statistics specific to common Wireless LANs.
+  The beauty of it is that a single set of tool can support all the
+  variations of Wireless LANs, regardless of their type (as long as
+  the driver supports Wireless Extension). Another advantage is that
+  these parameters may be changed on the fly without restarting the

   Some user-level drivers for scarab devices which don't require
