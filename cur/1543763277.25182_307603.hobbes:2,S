Your problem is almost certainly in the hardware area (cpu, bios,
memory, power, northbridge, motherboard, cooling or thereabouts).
> Imo memtest86 should not hang onless something screws up [its] memory area
There is nothing else running when memtest runs.  You cannot assume
that your hardware is operating like a sane digital computer when
memtest hangs - the magic of zero's, one's and instruction set
architectures is coming unglued and you are getting a glimpse of the
ugliness that is usually hidden behind the curtain.
Good luck fixing it.
LKML is probably not the place to continue to analyze this, now that
you've recreated it with memtest as well.
