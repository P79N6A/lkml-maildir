Well could you do me a mall favour of dumping a combined ide cleanup 
relative to 2.5.4 on me?
In contrast to Linus I don't like scattered patches ;-). I will at least 
give it a deep code look today for the
ide-cdrom stuff, becouse it was always annoying to me that the default 
distribution setup
is using the ide interface to my CD-recorder and every single recorder 
aplication out there
is using the scsi interface instead.
