Given that libata goes through the scsi layer at the moment, shifting
from the traditional PATA drivers to the libata ones is going to result
in a shift from hdfoo to sdbar. We're not really looking forward to this
from the distribution point of view, though I think the same thing
happened in the past when shifting from the ancient SATA drivers to the
libata ones.
