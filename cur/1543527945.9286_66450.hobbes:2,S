For those that don't know, this is exactly what Solaris does:
/dev/null -> ../devices/pseudo/mm@0:null
/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s2 -> ../../devices/sbus@1f,0/SUNW,fas@e,8800000/sd@3,0:c
/dev/ptyq3 -> ../devices/pseudo/ptc@0:ptyq3
/dev/pts/7 -> ../../devices/pseudo/pts@0:7
/dev/fbs/cgsix0 -> ../../devices/sbus@1f,0/cgsix@2,0:cgsix0
The /etc/devlink.tab file is used by the devlinks program to
create these links. This program, along with the drvconfig program,
is run during a reconfiguration reboot. Linux is a bit more
dynamic, but it could still use the same config file and
the same "/devices" directory.
I'd guess 
http://docs.sun.com/
 has public documentation for this.
