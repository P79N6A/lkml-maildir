Subject: [PATCH] KVM: Fix lockup on 32-bit intel hosts with nx disabled in the bios
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/31/135

Intel hosts, without long mode, and with nx support disabled in the bios
have an efer that is readable but not writable.  This causes a lockup on
switch to guest mode (even though it should exit with reason 34 according to
the documentation).
