I've noticed my laptop is less able to output the required current for my 
portable HD than my desktop; either way it's probably not a good idea 
exceeding the USB specifications for current output @ 5V, so I'd recommend 
you use a powered hub or external PSU (if the HD supports one).
Also a (slightly) nasty but functional trick is to have the power in when the 
HD initially spins up, then remove the power. Once the drive has spun up it 
seems to use a lot less power.
You can get special USB cables that link two USB ports' 5Vs together in 
parallel, which seems to help supply the necessary current; after the HD has 
spun up you can remove the second "dummy" USB connector (my laptop only has 
two USB ports and I require the second port).
