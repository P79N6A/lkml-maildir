for every save on a gitfs mounted dir, do an implied checkpoint, commit, or 
publish (should be adjustable), on its privately created on-the-fly 
repository.
### END WORKFLOW C ###
For example:
  echo "// last comment on this file" >> /gitfs.mounted/file
should do an implied checkpoint, and make these checkpoints immediately 
visible under some checkpoint branch of the gitfs mounted dir.
Note, this way the developer gets version control without even noticing, and 
works completely transparent to any kind of application.
Thanks!
