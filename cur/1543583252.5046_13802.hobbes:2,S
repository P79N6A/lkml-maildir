Subject: [patch-2.4.2] bugfix -- ENXIO for read/write beyond end of raw device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi Linus,
Yes, I know that Stephen had fixed this bug ages ago but, nevertheless, it
is still present in 2.4.2 and I don't know about his plans for resending
the patch -- but it is a part of the set I maintain so I just wanted to
bring it to your attention. Small bug, small obvious fix -- why not
consider it sooner rather than later?
Regards,
Tigran
