Henning, in any long lived source base, coding style is crucial.  People
who think that coding style is personal are just wrong.  Let's compare,
shall we?
Professional: the coding style at this job looks like XYZ, ok, I will now
    make my code look like XYZ.
Amateur: my coding style is better than yours.
I think that if you ask around, you'll find that the pros use a coding 
style that isn't theirs, even when writing new code.  They have evolved
to use the prevailing style in their environment.  I know that's true for
me, my original style was 4 space tabs, curly braces on their own line,
etc.  I now code the way Bill Joy codes, fondly known as Bill Joy normal
form.
Anyway, if you think any coding style is better than another, you completely
miss the point.  The existing style, whatever it is, is the style you use.
I personally despise the GNU coding style but when I make changes there,
that's what I use because it is their source base, not mine.
