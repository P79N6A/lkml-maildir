I don't see how it works.
spin_lock_irqsave() increments  preempt_count()
in_atomic checks is defined as:
# define in_atomic()    ((preempt_count() & ~PREEMPT_ACTIVE) != kernel_locked())
kernel_locked() is defined as:
#define kernel_locked()         (current->lock_depth >= 0)
If you call schedule while in_atomic() then it prints out the error 
"bad: scheduling while atomic!\n".  
As far as I can see set_current_state() doesn't affect
preempt_count() or current->lock_depth.  I must be 
missing something...
