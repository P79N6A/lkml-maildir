Will check. Thanks for info.

Well one good reason is I don't trust ext3 because it is new and I haven't 
used it before. (You can call me paranoid all you want...) Before I start 
trusting it with my really important data, I would rather use ext3 for a 
while on /, /usr and other non-important partitions (they can be 
reinstalled, /home cannot...)
