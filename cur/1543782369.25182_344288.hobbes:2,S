With reboot=c, reboot=w and reboot=h it still powers off. With reboot=b 
it actually reboots. With 2.6.13-rc2 (the previous good kernel here) it 
just works and does a reboot with no special parameters.
I also have lapic nmi_watchdog=1 in boot command line but removing these 
does not help either.
So far I only know that rc6+somegit and rc7 power off and rc2 works, 
will try som kernels inbetween.
