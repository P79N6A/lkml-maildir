No, we cannot.  This is not true on ThinkPads, for example.  We *can* make
it true, but AFAIK that means overriding the entire generic ACPI battery
driver, and greating a "glue" thinkpad_battery one that does:
	1. generic ACPI battery access when ACPI is available
	2. thinkpad specific ACPI battery access when ACPI is available
	3. thinkpad specific EC firmware battery access (not ACPI).
That requires the new driver to use functions from ibm_acpi and tp_smapi,
plus the stuff in the generic acpi battery access driver.
It might be the best way to go for ThinkPads, actually.  Some rework on
ibm_acpi ain't that bad, and tp_smapi is already undergoing major surgery.

Yes.

Good question.
