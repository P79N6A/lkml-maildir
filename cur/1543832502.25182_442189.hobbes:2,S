Abu, I guess you have turned on CONFIG_EMBEDDED and disabled everything
you don't need, turned off full sized data structures, removed everything
else you don't need from the kernel config, turned off kernel debugging
(especially slab debugging).
If you still have problems, what does /proc/slabinfo tell you when running
your application under both 2.4 and 2.6?
