Not true, though you seem to have already figured that out.
md uses barrier writes when writing the superblock.  This is partly
because it seems like a good idea, but largely to test if barrier
writes are going to work on the component devices.  If any device
claims not to support barriers, then raid1 will claim not to support
barriers.
And the strange hang happens while md is trying to update the
superblock.
