In 256kb it will be hard to even support simple user space.
One solution might be to just use linux as a library and
implement your application code in the kernel, inside
of the . That lets you throw out all system calls and some
of the init code of the kernel (don't call rest_init).
At that stage, you have lost most of the advantages of
using Linux over some other kernel.
