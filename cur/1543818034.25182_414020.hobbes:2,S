I've been using bonnie++ off and on for a long time. Suddenly, it has
started failing when run against an XFS filesystem situated on a SATA
drive. Here's the output of a run:
$ bench/sbin/bonnie++ -m "Luther 2.6.17-rc1 XFS SATA" \
> -d /archive/bench \
> -s 3008 \
> -n 1024 >> bonnie.out 2>> bonnie.err

Cleaning up test directory after error.
This is on a 2.6.17-rc1 Linux kernel. The interesting thing
is that not even root cannot delete the directory in which
bonnie++ is working:
[~]$ ls -ld /archive/bench/Bonnie.8426/
drwx------  2 kwall users 4096 2006-04-05 09:06 /archive/bench/Bonnie.8426/
[~]$ ls -al /archive/bench/Bonnie.8426/
total 24
drwx------  2 kwall users 4096 2006-04-05 09:06 ./
drwxr-xr-x  4 kwall users   42 2006-04-05 06:24 ../
[~]$ sudo rm -rf /archive/bench/Bonnie.8426
rm: cannot remove directory `/archive/bench/Bonnie.8426': Directory not
empty
As you can see, the directory is empty, but a "rm" fails (as does
"rmdir"). I'm retesting with a 2.6.16 kernel as I type. It isn't
clear if the problems is XFS, some other piece of the kernel, or
bonnie++. Neither dmesg nor syslog shows anything amiss. I suppose 
I could strace the run, but I'm not especially eager to deal with 
a multi-gigabyte output file if there is a more focused method to
isolate the problem.
I've also written to bonnie++'s author.
Thanks for the help.
Best regards,
Kurt
