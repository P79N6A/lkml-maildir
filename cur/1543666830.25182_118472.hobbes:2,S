Hi,
My workstation froze hard again , this time after few hours.
There was no disk activiy and nothing on the serial console :-(
The machine didn't freeze even even when i ran several program et the same time
(opera, mozilla, sylpheed, pan,etc...) but froze as the box was almost idle.
Thanks,
Philippe
