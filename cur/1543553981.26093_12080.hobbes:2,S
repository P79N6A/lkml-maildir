Hi Taisuke,
So you like that TASKFILE. ;-)
The 48-LBA stuff is on hold because it requires more than simple changes
to ide-disk.c.  The rules for the setting of the HOB and the double pump
of the safety check that allows on to read back the contents before the
command register is executed, is still in development.  We have not voted
on the final design of the 48-LBA and no drive or BIOS guys have any
product ready for testing.
Cheers,
