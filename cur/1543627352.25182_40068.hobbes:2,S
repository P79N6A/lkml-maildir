oops really sorry, It will really earase your disk.
This morning I was really sleepy and wanted to write something other:
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/ bs=1024 count=100000 
and so you can know what's the speed not of your ide or scsi (or
something other) which is given by hdparm but it will give you the speed
through the used filesystem.
Sorry about that.
