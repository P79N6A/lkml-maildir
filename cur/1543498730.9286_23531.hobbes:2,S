The opl3sa2 driver only works as a module and you have to follow the 
instructions.  I've sent the patch to make it work non-modular a few times to 
lists such as linux-sound but it just doesn't seem to make the kernel.
So if you were trying non-modular, that is your problem.  Search the 
linux-sound archive for the patch.
Somehow I think sound is one of the problems many kernel developers wish would 
just go away.
David.
