Consider this code:
	char *foo = 0;
	sigset(SIGSEGV,SIG_IGNORE);
	for(;;) { *foo = '\5'; }
Your logfiles just got DoS'ed....
(Your syslog will just print 'last message repeated 11934 times'? OK, put two
different signals in the loop.. ;)
And yes, I've worked on systems that will log SEGV... and the logs get ugly.
