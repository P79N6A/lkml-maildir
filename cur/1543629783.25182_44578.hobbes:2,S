Yes, it looks like a good idea.

They still have a problem - but they'll probably know what to do as they
had to change default NLS from iso8859-1 to something else.

Yes, I checked it. After changing iso* all singlebyte encodings except
cp874 contain unique mapping for all byte values (cp874 is unique, but
some values are unmappable).
