Hi,
the macbook pro suspends just fine, but even though the machine returns
to X I see on resume some random garbled output but can still move the
mouse cursor (which is OK!) and using the keyboard successfully adjust
the brightness of the display.
However I cannot switch to the console (via ctrl+alt+f1) nor does ctrl
+alt+backspace do anything....
This is on debian sid with the latest xorg radeon driver from
experimental, i.e. ii  xserver-xorg-video-radeon
1:6.9.0.91-1.
Any ideas?
Soeren
