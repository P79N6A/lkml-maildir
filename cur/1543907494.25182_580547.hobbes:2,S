I have a little more information.  I tried generating the configuration
using a 'make ARCH=x86_64 defconfig' I took the resulting file, which is
configured for x86_64 and use it as a alternative configuration file for
makeconfig and then save it without making any changes.  The newly saved
file has been restructured for 32bit.  Does this sound like a bug?

Subject: make menuconfig refuses to let CONFIG_X86_64=y and CONFIG_64BIT
remain
Hello I'm new to the list.  In the process of using make menuconfig, I
used an older config(2.6.11) to start my new configuration (2.6.17) and
notice that original settings for CONFIG_X86_64=y and CONFIG_64BIT=y are
being over ridden and replace by CONFIG_M686=y setting and
CONFIG_X86_32=y
Does this sound like new dependencies have been added for X86_64 support
and menuconfig is disabling the symbol because of a dependency shortage?
When I search on the symbol in the menuconfig GUI I see that it calls
out the flag as Symbol: X86_64 [=X86_64]... no other dependency's are
specified there.  
Can anyone explain this behavior to me?
