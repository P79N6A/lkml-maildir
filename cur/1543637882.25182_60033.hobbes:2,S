Why not? Who really needs the ability to name anything in /dev ?
You can always use a symlink if you realy, realy want.

I am afraid I have to disagree violently here.
A device on this level is a logical thing. It must not matter which subsystem it
is attached to. Furthermore, the subsystem cannot know what the physical
device actually does. That's what a driver does.

The problem is that a device without a mapping to a driver is a valid
state. In fact, this is how hotplugging scripts have to work.

They export a kdev_t ???
