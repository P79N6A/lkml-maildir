	Oh - I did handle SIGIO (I forgot to show that in my pseudo code).
	The handler logs a warning message about signal queue overflow.

	Is SIGIO somehow guaranteed to be queued?  The reason the
	kernel sends SIGIO is because there is no more room to queue
	signals, right?
	Also, the wouldn't it be better to _lose_ an event (and
	possibly leave a connection in limbo) than to spend the time
	to poll 10k+ sockets?  Remember, you are going to be _heavily_
	loaded before you start seeing SIGIO. 
	I understand that each thread has it's own signal queue and
	that you can tune the size of the signal queue via
	/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max.  Is that correct?  If so, then I
	can consider the SIGIO as a warning that I need to configure
	the server with more queue space, or get faster hardware.
	What do you think?

	This is an excellent reference (I read it several times before
	starting this project).  Thanks for putting it up.

	I'm using only one RT signal.  Each thread seems to have it's
	own signal queue.  In the tests that I've done, the thread
	that F_SETOWN's the socket is the recipient of all IO-related
	signals for that socket. (Which is you would expect with Linux's
	non-posix thread/signal behavior)
