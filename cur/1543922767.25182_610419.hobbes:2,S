I dont think so. IT887x has builtin interrupt controller which multiplexes 
16 external IRQ pins with IRQs from builtin devices (parallel port, UARTs
and GPIO) into single INTA# line. IT887x also contains 8-bit ISA-like bus
and 16 chip select lines and it's all you need to glue UARTs to PCI bus.
I suspect that it's interrupt controller problem, probably edge/level
triggered settings.
