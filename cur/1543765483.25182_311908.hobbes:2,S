I believe I have emailed IBM about 20 times about this, and have sent emails
to the people from IBM Research and the same guys that did the Security chip
Encryption project for Linux and they tried looking into it, but never heard
really anything back. Maybe now that they are with Lenovo, they probably
could release some more specs...
