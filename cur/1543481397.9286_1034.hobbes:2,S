That's an attempt to break into your machine using a buffer overflow.
Don't worry about it, it won't work. Check out Bugtraq for an explanation.
You might like to grab snplog-1.0.tar.gz from www.freshmeat.net and
install them. They'll log all ICMP, UDP, TCP connections along with the
addresses, so you can track them down and get them kicked off the net for
illegal actions. 
Cheers,
Alex
