Umm, stop.
Scsi midlayer patches don't go directly to Linus, but through the linux-scsi
list and James into the linux-scsi bk repository first.
The patch still has a bunch of problem not solved, and contains two things
that should be independant patches.
The first patch should be the host_queue locking you added, this one currently
has the following issues:
* you call spin_lock on a semaphore once!
* you take semaphores inside spinlocks and with interrupts disabled
* the coding style needs some imnprovements (you adds lots of empty lines,
  and there's a space before the opening brakes of function calls).
the actual driver still has other issues:
* you still duplicated lots of code from scsi.c
* your header is still in include/linux instead of include/scsi,
  but imho it should be merged into scsi.h anyway
* you still havent explain why wwn -> host id translation can't
  be done in userspace
* you still have useage information in the driverfs files.
