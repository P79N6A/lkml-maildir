   Seconded.  Thanks for remembering that name.
   
No problem :)
   Has his stuff been cleaned up, code-wise, in the past few years?  My 
   experience with it was 100% positive from a technical standpoint, but 
   negative from a style standpoint...
   
I think it'll be less work to toss his stuff into the tree
and have some janitor whack on it than try to get someone
to maintain what we have now.
