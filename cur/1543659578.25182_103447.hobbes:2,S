_SC_ARG_MAX is one of the identifiers that are used with sysconf() to
lookup a system-wide configuration value:
    $ perl -MPOSIX -e 'print sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX), "\n"'
    131072
The environment size for a program invoked using exec() can be up to
131072 bytes long (my configuration). This environment holds the
command arguments as well as the environment.
On my system, _SC_ARG_MAX is telling me that it is possible to have
argv[0] be just under 131072 bytes long.
