I had a tool long ago on the Amiga which did exactly that. It double checked
that the indentation matched the code flow and flagged any differences. 
It was a dumb tool -- not a full C parser; but worked just fine. I got
it from some free software floppy disk. Unfortunately I forgot the
name and was never able to find it again.
These days emacs can do it for me though, but doing it in batch would
be nicer.
