More like the UTS blocks the thread and waits for an IO upcall to notify
the change of state in the kernel. It's equivalent to a single in overhead,
something like a SIGIO, or async IO notification.
Delete 3 and 4. It's certainly much faster than select() and family.

Right, then marks it running and runs it.

Crazy synchronization by non-web-server like applications. Who knows. I
personally can't think up really clear example at this time since I don't
do that kind of programming, but I'm sure concurrency experts can...
I'm just not one of those people.
