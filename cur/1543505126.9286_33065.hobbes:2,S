I can't speak for the Netherlands as I don't know what goes on there,
but here in the UK, it is the hardware alone that is certified, and if
the hardware has certification, then any software can be used with it.
My understanding is that the UK regulations are based on the USA ones,
so I would expect similar in the USA as well.
Best wishes from Riley.
