I feel that you are getting confused Linux = linux (kernel)? This
effort is pretty much lies with the distro guys. I have played couple
of gameson the Linux. And tried with wine/winex too (mostly failed due
wine config issues).
One day...I would love to see the only games on Windows I play -
MotoGP & Age of Empires   getting rocked on Linux, but am not sure
whether this happens or not.
I didn't try any commercial wine on Linux.
