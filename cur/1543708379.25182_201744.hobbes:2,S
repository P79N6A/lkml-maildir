There's better troll than you, Matti :)
In a stock 2.6 kernel you get support for the following 2GB FC adapters:
  Qlogic 2xxx/6xxx (PCI-X/ PCI-Express)
  LSI Fusion
  IBM zfcp (okay, you need a mainframe for that, but.. :))
if you like a crappy out of tree vendor driver you can also get Emulex
support.  You belowed vendor JNI unfortunately only has binary only drivers
for intel plattforms and 2.2/2.4 kernels.
