Not all architectures have asm/setup.h. And not all have the command line 
somewhere convenient before setup_arch runs, although that could perhaps be 
changed.
I wonder if calling checksetup(0, ...) should be called from setup_arch as 
soon as the command line is available, rather than in start_kernel().
