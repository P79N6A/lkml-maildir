I definitely agree.

I was thinking about having "raw" (e.g. FF_RAW) effect, which would be only
X "axes"/entries of u32, where X is about 10 for future use and simply
posting these values further to HW (maybe after clamping or driver specific
processing) from this array. This seems to be augmentation of FF_CONSTANT
but the fact, it doesn't compute forces from direction.
Also yet another one such as FF_VECTOR or FF_3D could be considered as one
posibility, but it's still the same -- to have no more than 3 entries to
pass forces...

At least me :). I'm using it for wheel and joystick in modules for locally
developped multiplatform virtual reality system.
