It sure is easier, but we're discussinng the case where units change
in runtime; what do we document then? Plug in a different battery and
you get reports in mA and mAh  insted of mW and mWh.
The suggestions so far were:
1. Append units string to the content of such attribute:
   /sys/.../capacity_remaining reads "16495 mW".
2. Add a seprate *_units attribute saying what are units for other attribute:
   /sys/.../capacity_units gives the units for
   /sys/.../capacity_{remaining,last_full,design,min,...}.
3. Append the units to the attribute names:
   capacity_{remaining,last_full,design_min,...}:mV.
