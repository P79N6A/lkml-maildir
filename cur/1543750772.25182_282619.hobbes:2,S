Me too, on the other two machine doesn't have ; only the firewall box has. It seems
to be related to iproute2 or MARK target? as only the firewall box uses 
iptables to mark packets and then use iproute2 to route it.
I am pretty sure the config and kernel build are correct.
I will try to find out how to reproduce the problem with the other two machine I have here
