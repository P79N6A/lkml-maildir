Hi,
I wanted to modify file copy so it supports extended attributes. I am using
extended attributes provided by the XFS filesystem, and right now when I
copy a file with an extended attribute bit set on, the copy of the file does
not preserve the extended attribute. I could use some help in this area
because I am not sure where to start. If anyone has some suggestions or can
offer me some help or resources to go to, please let me know.
Thanks,
Eric
