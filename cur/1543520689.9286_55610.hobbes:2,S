A year and a half ago I wrote the user-space API which would make use
of Eric Biederman's shmfs. This same code will work nicely with this
new implementation. Let me know where it ends up being mounted and
when it goes into the kernel, and I'll dust off the user-space code
and make it available again. It would be nice to finally have POSIX
SHM.
