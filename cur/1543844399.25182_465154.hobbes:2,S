And somebody (I forget who) was complaining that some debugging tool was only available
on the x86/sparc/ppc families of CPUs, and didn't like Alan Cox's suggestion
that they go add it.
Given that missing an entire class of syscall (the *at flavors) on an
architecture isn't a deterrent to inclusion, Alan's response was totally
on-target....
(I'm presuming the usual reason for such missing syscalls is that nobody
has bothered trying to run software that uses a *at call on an ARM, so
nobody's bothered wiring them up and thereby increasing the kernel image
size on a platform where it's likely to be *very* important?)
