I'm not the FSF, and I don't speak for it, but it seems to me that
this would be "mission accomplished".
The goal AFAIK is not to force people to enable others to hack the
hardware or software to their liking.  The goal is respect for the
freedoms, it's not making it more difficult for others to do what you
can and want to do.  I guess it also goes under the name "Golden
Rule".  Others might phrase it as tit-for-tat, or quid pro quo.
