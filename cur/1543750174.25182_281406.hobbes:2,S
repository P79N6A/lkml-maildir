A whole range of quirky systems, probably in most cases buggy hardware,
BIOS firmware setup bugs and the like but they are there and end users
use them. Its __init code so it is free.
As to real bugs there is probably a good three to six months fixing
needed for the DMA timeout paths having been debugging them, along with
timer/irq races all over the place. I'd rather worry about the fact the
IDE eh code is totally hosed first and realistically needs an ide_eh
thread for error handling akin to the SCSI approach.

The current code uses
dma_ for DMA variables
ide_dma_ for functions
Its nice clean and logical. I'll consider moving my IDE code over to
your naming when the naming is consistent again (with or without the
ide_).
