Hi Adam,
Oh, but he _did_ give you information about such things. You filtered out 
the real message. Allow me to expand the macros ...
yucky mess = referenced area has an unnecessarily complex control 
             structure. (more branches & code, slower ...) 
just = fundamental simplification of the algorithm. (less code and 
       branching needed because less to do, smaller, faster ...)
hope, pray = referenced area can generate complex errors that cannot 
       be handled efficiently due to architectural limitations.
       (more local error handling code and branching, bigger, slower ...)
expert opinion != prejudicial speech. 
Read it again. You'll get the hang of it  :-)
Cheers,
Ed
