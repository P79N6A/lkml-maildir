The semaphore is used to protect the fields in ipc_ids structure, while
the spinlock is used to protect IPC ids. For the current implementation,
there is one spinlock for all IPC ids of the same type(i.e. for all
messages queues).  The patch is intend to breaks down the global
spinlock and have a lock per IPC id.
