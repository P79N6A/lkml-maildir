Yuk!  What is the benefit of introducing this incompatibility?  #ifdefs
are harmful to maintainance, and it's only one word, so why not always
put in the dummy struct member?

Is there any reason, other than the above-described bit of evil, for doing
this (forbidding mixing)?  It prevents the bug-finding approach I
described earlier (a binary search for finding miscompiled code) from
working.
