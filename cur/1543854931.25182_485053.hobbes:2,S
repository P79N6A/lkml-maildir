Hi Rogier,
here's a patch to fix a typo in rio_linux which affects both
kernel 2.4 and 2.6. It's not big deal it seems as it only
affects the irq-less path.
I found this one like that :
 $ grep -r '[^&]&[^&]*![^=]' drivers/char/
I'm sure others will find more efficient rules to catch such
errors.
Regards,
Willy

Subject: [PATCH] rio: typo in bitwise AND expression.
The line :
    hp->Mode &= !RIO_PCI_INT_ENABLE;
is obviously wrong as RIO_PCI_INT_ENABLE=0x04 and is used as a bitmask
2 lines before. Getting no IRQ would not disable RIO_PCI_INT_ENABLE
but rather RIO_PCI_BOOT_FROM_RAM which equals 0x01.
Obvious fix is to change ! for ~.
