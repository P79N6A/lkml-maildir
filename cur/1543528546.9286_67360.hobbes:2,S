: DSM isn't nonsense. Porting _is_ easier and computers usually _are_
: cheaper than people. You pulled the "200" and "20" out of thin air;
: it is actually "249" and "243".
Really?  Actually, I didn't pull it out of thin air - read any of the
many (rather pointless) PhD's on the topic, or do some benchmarks.
Or you could just _think_ before you _talk_.  Remote page fault, best
case, around 2 milliseconds.  Cache line miss, around 200ns.  There's a
factor of 10,000 difference.  Add in a really long think time and you
might be only a factor of ten slower, I was being very generous.

Been there, done that, several times over the last 10 years.  What's 
changed?  It didn't work then, so what has changed?
: > As far as I can tell, those limits are all in the performance area.

: This is also just wrong. If there was a solution that was both
: easier and faster than DSM, you might be right. You can only point
: to solutions that are one or the other though. DSM is a compromise.
: For both ease of use and the performance, you get something partway
: between SMP and message passing.
No, you get a toy that looks neat for demos and works like shit in
practice.  But please, don't take my word for it, step forward with
the list of programs that do work over DSM.  Show me the numbers.

: 
: Pages are like huge cache lines. Don't gripe about cache lines, OK?
: Good SMP code avoids cache line ping pong. Bad code doesn't bother.
: (then again, if the "bad" code was cheap, maybe it isn't so bad)
So you like a world were your cache line misses take 10,000
times longer than normal, do you?  You know what, you're right.
If you have code that is so cache insensitive that it wouldn't
notice the difference, DSM would work great.  I just have never
heard of a single example of code like that needs shared memory.
But if you have apps like that, more power to you.  All I care
about it is that it never gets in the kernel.  You shouldn't care
about if it is or it isn't, with latencies like that, you can
do your pager in user space and have the big fun.
