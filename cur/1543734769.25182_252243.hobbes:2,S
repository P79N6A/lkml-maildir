If we are still talking about the same thing here, gibberish is a rather
strong word. In the design I proposed access control affects the subset
of tasks returned as a result -- the tool would still display meaningful
information for the tasks it got replies for.
Anyway, if the access restrictions are hard-coded into the field ID,
then it's only the credentials that can change, and I can't see a race
there at the moment.

They don't, because the access control I had in my dev tree silently
skipped tasks containing fields the process had no permission to read.
IOW, access control works as an implicit task selector. And security
wise that's clean because the kernel does not reveal any information
about other processes to the querying task (not even evidence of their
existence).

Agreed on every point.
The question I am pondering is: Does nproc need access control right now?
It's more work in kernel and user space and adds new opportunities to
introduce bugs. The merits seem rather dubious right now, considering
that all the fields used by current process info tools (files
/proc/pid{cmdline, stat, statm, status, wchan}) are world readable.
So my preference is to wait with access control until we know where
and how it is necessary.
