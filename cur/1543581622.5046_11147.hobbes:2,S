Hi all,
I run RedHat 7 with 2.2.16-22 and 2.4.0
when a program uses the cpuid instruction under 2.4.0 it gets an illegal
instruction signal. 
Under 2.2.16-22 that is not the case (it just works). I think (but can't
easily verify) that I never saw that problem under 2.2.x.
The Processor in question is a 6x86-L-PR200 from Cyrix/IBM.
I have attached a little test in back (run in gdb).
best regards,
 Florian Nierhaus
