I beg to disagree. statm catche eyes when you want to know precisely 
your memory usage or do you consider to be the single statm user via procps?

Sure but displaying it via status information would be much more simple 
furthermore I think it is incorrectly computed.

The free command does provide the information I think so it must be 
somewhere else...

Sure but many people in the embedded wolrd need to know precisley 
process memory usage and possibly inside the program itsel not via 
top/ps/free/...
And if tools display wrong information for ages, then it can still be 
fixed...
