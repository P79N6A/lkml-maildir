The security problem, on a multi-user box, is that negative priority
apps can easily take all of the CPU and effectively lock up the box.
Something I've often thought would fix this is to allow normal users
to set negative priority which is limited to using X% of the CPU -
i.e. those tasks would have their priority raised if they spent more
than a small proportion of their time using the CPU.
