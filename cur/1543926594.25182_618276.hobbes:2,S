will test the patch tomorrow and get back to you with results.

i'm not that familiar with serial port settings either, but IIRC the cflag is
used to set the requested byte size of the transferred chars (cf
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port#Data_Bits
). Thus, according to the
above CS8 is used for setting up transfer of any kind of data over the serial connection.

err, you mean keyspan_open() ...
..and yes, almost all of the usb to serial converter drivers call their own
*_set_termios-routine so that they could "synchronize" the line discipline user
settings with those of the converter.
