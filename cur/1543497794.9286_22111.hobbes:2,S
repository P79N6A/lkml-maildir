   I don't think cross-compiling for a 64-bit target on a 32-bit host
   works properly.
It works perfectly fine, and in fact right now is the only way, to
build sparc64 kernels on a Sparc* system.  In fact the Alpha folks
were the first ones ever, real early on, to make ix86 --> Alpha kernel
cross build working with gcc.
Later,
