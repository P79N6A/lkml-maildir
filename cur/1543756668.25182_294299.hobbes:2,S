Thanks for the kind words.
All distros are trying to reduce boot time.  I don't think that the
module autoload time has been fingered as taking any serious ammount of
boot time due to it happening in the background of everything else.  But
yes, this should help it out (as long as we aren't trading I/O time for
CPU time, like it can happen if you don't have a populated modules.alias
file...)
And yes, I've been in contact with the Ubuntu developer already about
using this code, instead of dietHotplug.
thanks,
