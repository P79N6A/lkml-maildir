Subject: Fasttrak66 hangs with ACPI built in (2.4.18, 20)

hi, all,
i tried to build in ACPI support for kernel 2.4.18 and
20. i have a Fasttrak66 raid and 3 other IDE disks. as
long as i build in ACPI and enable any IDE devices,
the bootup hangs before (or while, i guess) probing
IDE for the device on Fasttrak66. say, every time the
screen frozes as:
    ... ...
    hda: ... /* my IDE disk 1 */ ...
    hdc: ... /* my IDE disk 2 */ ...
    hdd: ... /* my IDE disk 3 */ ...
(if boot up normally, there should be hde: and hdg:
follow to show my harddisks connected to Fasttrak).
however, everything works fine if
    either: no ACPI built-in
    or:     i disable all the IDE disks (hda - hdd).
i'm using ASUS mobo CUSL2, BIOS version 1009.
thanks a lot for your precious time !
