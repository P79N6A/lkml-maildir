Subject: pre9 total IP failure, bad performance with pre[78]

Just booted pre9 aka 2.2.0-final. Hate to say bring something like this
up, but I experienced what appears to be complete IP/TCP/ICMP failure. Can
get at most 1 ping response from ANY interface, including loopback. No tcp
connections can be established, etc. With pre7 and pre8, a ping -f
localhost gives between 80-95% packet loss on average but the behavior
appears in "spurts":
--- localhost ping statistics ---
1553 packets transmitted, 776 packets received, 50% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.6/249.2/501.9 ms
--- localhost ping statistics ---
10574 packets transmitted, 1022 packets received, 90% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.6/461.2/806.2 ms
--- localhost ping statistics ---
63408 packets transmitted, 1022 packets received, 98% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.6/320.9/505.0 ms
--- localhost ping statistics ---
16875 packets transmitted, 1022 packets received, 93% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.6/282.9/521.8 ms
Very strange. Is there something magic about 1022? Using a packet size of
5000:
--- localhost ping statistics ---
96 packets transmitted, 24 packets received, 75% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 5.4/34.5/63.5 ms
--- localhost ping statistics ---
795 packets transmitted, 24 packets received, 96% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 5.6/35.1/64.6 ms
What is going on here?

Any other info needed I am happy to provide. I hope this is an extremely
