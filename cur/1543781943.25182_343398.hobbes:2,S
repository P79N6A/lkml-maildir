I think you're mistaken:
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.programming.threads/browse_frm/thread/0d4eaf3703131e86/da051ebe58976b00#da051ebe58976b00
sched_yield() is required to be supported even if priority scheduling is 
not supported, and it is required to cause the calling thread (not 
process) to yield the processor.
