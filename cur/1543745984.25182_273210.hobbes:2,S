i have released the -V0.7.30-2 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
the biggest change in this release are fixes for priority-inheritance
bugs uncovered by Esben Nielsen pi_test suite. These bugs could explain
some of the jackd-under-load latencies reported.
Changes since -V0.7.29-0:
 - priority inheritance handling fixes:
    - sort the RT wakees at wakeup time, not at block-time: an RT task
      might have gotten boosted while it slept.
    - fix priority-restoration bug at mutex-release time
    - use task_rt() not p->policy to determine whether a task needs 
      PI handling - a SCHED_OTHER task might be boosted to RT prio.
    - fix mutex_setprio() bug: queue now-RT tasks to the active array, 
      otherwise expired SCHED_OTHER tasks will not be properly boosted.
 - went back to the mask-and-delay method of handling hardirqs on 
   UP-IOAPIC as well. Due to APIC prioritization hardirqs can get
   delayed by another, unacked hardirq, so the quick method needs more 
   work before it can be used.
 - added Thomas Gleixner's semaphore -> completion changes for 
   drv->unload_sem. This fixes the module unload crashes reported by 
   Rui Nuno Capela and Shane Shrybman.
 - dvb mutex updates for RT, this fixes the bug reported by Christian 
   Meder.
 - e100 fix from K.R. Foley - this should fix the boot-time e100
   enable_irq warning.
 - NFS lockd mutex RT fixes from Thomas Gleixner - this could fix some
   of the bugs reported by Bill Huey.
 - PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY fixes - this could fix the boot-time hang reported 
   by Lee Revell.
 - wake up irq thread upon creation - this solves the 'irq thread only 
   changes priority after first interrupt arrives' anomaly reported.
