This is part of the implementation of robust PI futexes.  The
semantics is that if the owner of a robust futex dies the futex is
marked with FUTEX_OWNER_DIED.  The next locking thread then has to
clear that bit before calling pthread_mutex_unlock.  If the bit is
still set while unlocking the mutex is permanently marked unusable.  I
cannot say right now whether this is the semantics implemented above.
I'll have to check the glibc test suite whether we check for that
semantic.
