Nobody is forcing anybody to use Linux. If you don't agree, use something
else. Which probably has its own strings attached...

You are free to create your own kernel under your rules, and see how well
that one does. Linux is successful (at least in part) because people who
work on it on the whole agree with its GPLv2, and so do people who use it.
In any case, the split you present is quite something... either BSD's most
everything goes or adding draconian no-DRM-ever-anywhere rules, GPLv3
style.
