Yeah, I thought about that. Unfortunately, it doesn't meet my need for
not Heisenberg'ing the system. I can't instrument the struct semaphore
{} in a running system.

Yes. It is an inode->i_sem semaphore for a file being written to by the
high-priority SCHED_FIFO task.

This is a headless system.

Very. Only pingable, but can't login via telnet/ssh/anything. Reason is
the same reason the low priority mystery task is unable to run and
release the held semaphore.
