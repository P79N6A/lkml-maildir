Subject: [PATCH] show patch names

Precedence: bulk

This four-line patch provides a means for listing what patches have been
built into a kernel. This will help track non-standard kernel versions,
such as those released by Redhat, or Alan's ac series, etc. more easily.
With this patch in place, each new patch can include a file of the form
"patchname.[identifier]" in the top level source directory and
[identifier] will then be added to the kernel version string. For
instance, Alan's ac patches could include a file named patchdesc.ac2
(containing a change log, perhaps), and the resulting kernel would be
identified as 2.2.0-pre6+ac2, both at boot and by uname. 
This may prove especially useful for tracking problems with kernels built
by distribution packagers and problems reported by automated tools.

+This patch adds a simple method to identify patched kernels. Patches
+that include a file named 'patchdesc.*' in the top level source
+directory will cause the kernel to add the file extension to the
+version that is reported by uname(1). For instance, this file will
+result in the 2.x.x+name being reported.
