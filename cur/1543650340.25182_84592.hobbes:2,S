This patch was damaged in interesting ways, in particular the number of 
lines in the patch description was wrong, causing the patch program to get 
very confused.
That implies that you're using some kind of post-processing tool to remove
lines from the diff, without fixing up the diff numeric output. Correct?  
If so, your tools are broken.
I ended up hand-editing the diff to make it apply, please don't make me do 
it again.
