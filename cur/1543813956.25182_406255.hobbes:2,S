There's nothing in the interface documentation which says that a tag is
an index to anything.  It's an integer value which can be attached to an
item in a radix tree.  One has to look into the source to see the
limitation built into it.  
If we don't want the tests, fine, but it might make sense to fix the
interface documentation, at least, to note that "tag" is not an
arbitrary integer value.
