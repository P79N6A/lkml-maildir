OK, that makes sense, and it should be an option.

I look at it differently.  I want the tar filesystem to be analogous
to running tar.  When I run tar, other users are not notified of the
output, it's only for me.  If they want to run tar, they can too.
The same can be true for tarfs.  I mount it for my purpose, others can
mount it for theirs.  Since the daemon providing the filesystem asways
runs with the same capabilities as the user who did the mount, I and
others will always get the permissions that we have on the actual tar
file.
The end result in permission rules is the _same_ as with your
proposal.  There's nothing baroque in it.
Think of the "no permission for others" as "hiding", not as some
special permission rule.  And if this hiding can be nicely done with
namespaces, all the better, I'll happily drop this feature at that
instant.

Yeah, maybe that's something worth exploring.
Thanks,
