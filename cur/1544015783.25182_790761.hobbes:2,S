Yes, the network access part *is* something that should be part of a more
general interface.  Having said that, we currently are lacking a way for a
*general user* program to say "I'm all set up, and would like to disavow any
other further resource access (except maybe r/o access as "other" to file
systems)".
It's pretty easy for stuff running as root to play setuid()/capability() games
to throw away access rights.  It's damned hard for mortal users to do it.
