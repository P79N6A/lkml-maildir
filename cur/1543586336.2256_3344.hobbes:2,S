Subject: IDE Disk Corruption with 2.4.3 / NOT with AC kernels

I run into some major disk corruptions on my IDE disk with the new
2.4.3 kernel version. I did see the same corruptions with 2.4.2
- but back then I blamed reiserfs and went back to 2.4.1.
Now I did some more testing and found out that the Alan Cox 
series of kernel patches does not show these problems. I tried
one from the 2.4.1-ac series (I think it was ac8) and 2.4.2-ac20
with nothing but success. I was using the same .config file for
all tests to make sure that the problem was not caused by 
a kernel configuration issue. 
This is my hardware:
	- ABit KT7 board (KT133 chipset reported by lspci)
	- 1GHz Athlon
	- QUANTUM FIREBALLP AS40.0 disk (cat /proc/ide/hda/model)
Here is the output of lspci:

I can provide more information on request, I can also test patches - I have a test
partition that I'm using to test new kernel configurations without affecting my
"normal" system.
I am following the list only through the archives on the web, so if you want to
get in touch with me, please CC khk@khk.net.
