Hi,
tested this again, with 2.2.0-pre9 ("final"), problem is still present.
Linux machine (P2B-LS, EEpro/100, 10Mbit Hub) floods shared 10BaseT
network with junk packets, nearly killing SCO Unix machine in same
network.
Didn't bother doing further diagnosis on this as already done below, as
nothing seems to have been changed in the eepro100 driver anyway - so all
the relevant stuff should be the same as in my previous mail, attached 
below.
I repeat: this is absolutely unbearable for production environment.

Hi,
sorry to followup on my own e-mail, but I have new interesting things...:

I just found another problem, which is a lot more severe than this
"hickup" (which hasn't happened again since I wrote my last e-mail).
When the machine is sitting idle, it occasionally seems to send some 
kind of "ethernet flood packets" (in lack of a better term).  The traffic
LED of the 2.2.0-pre4 machine's port on the 10BaseT hub starts to flicker
like crazy, and my SCO Unix machine in the same network segment slows
down to a crawl - seems to have to process a lot of crazy stuff.
Doing a tcpdump on a third machine ("tcpdump -e -n") shows things like
the following:

I assumed that maybe something was wrong with auto-sensing 10/100 mbit,
so I built the eepro100 driver as module and loaded it with "options=0xc0",
which made it say:
eth0: Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 at 0xb800, 00:E0:18:90:84:1B, IRQ 10.
  Board assembly 668081-002, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
  Forcing 10Mbs half-duplex operation.   <<<<<<
  General self-test: passed.
  Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
  Internal registers self-test: passed.
  ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x24c9f043).
  Receiver lock-up workaround activated.
but this didn't change anything.
Resumee: the combination of this board (ASUS P2B-LS), driver (2.2.0-pre4) 
and network (10BaseT) is absolutely unusable for a production environment.
Besides this, 2.2.0-pre4 is well-behaving, including SCSI (AHA7890) 
and Sound (Jaz16).  [Sound not loaded during Ethernet experiments]
