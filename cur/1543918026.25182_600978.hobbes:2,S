Hm, well, that's a good question.  The initial semantics of the lazy
mode calls were "what VMI wants", and they're still not really nailed
down.  VMI doesn't support having both active at once, and its a little
unclear what it would mean anyway.  For now, we don't support multiple
lazy modes active at once, and the kernel never tries to do it (in fact,
it would be a bug, since lazy mmu must be preempt disabled, and lazy cpu
is only used for context switches).

Yeah, its a little more general than it needs to be.
