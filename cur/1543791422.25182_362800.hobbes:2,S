I can't remember why i_alloc_sem got introduced, and don't have time to
work it out: something to do with direct I/O races, perhaps?  Someone
else must advise, perhaps you will be able to drop that one.
But I think you'd be very unwise to drop i_sem too.  i_mmap_lock gets
dropped whenever preemption demands here, i_sem is what's preventing
someone else coming along and doing a concurrent truncate or remove.
You don't want that.
Sorry, I've not yet had time to study your patch: I do intend to,
but cannot promise when.  I fear it won't be as easy as making
these occasional responses.
