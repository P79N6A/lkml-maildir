Anyone have a pointer to what we are really trying to accomplish
with .subsection and .previous in the in-line and asm stuff?
Like maybe a readme or coding style doc for in-line and asm code?
That was the main thing I tripped over while trying to build
a 2.5 kernel using the cygwin toolchain with an eye towards
uml under windows.  I found very little documentation about
the directives themselves even in the gnu info stuff and nada,
except one thread about abstracting them in spinlocks,
bout how/why they are used in the kernel.  They appear to be
elf specific which is why the i386pe stuff puked on them.  I
assume that most of this is to maximize cache hits, but that's
just a guess.  There are a largish handful of them scattered
around the kernel outside of locks. Any pointers would be appreciated.
