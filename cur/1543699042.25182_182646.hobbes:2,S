Ouch this English doesn't say what I mean.  Instead I should have said:
a) cdrom.ko refuses to pass thru writes unless patched.
b) sr_mod.ko refuses to pass thru writes unless patched.
c) ide-cd.ko refuses to pass thru writes unless patched or asked via
ioctl e.g. via blockdev --setrw.
I'm guessing the maintainers of cdrom.ko sr_mod.ko would accept a patch
to make blockdev --setrw work for those as well as it already does for
ide-cd.ko.
