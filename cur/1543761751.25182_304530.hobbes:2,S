	Hello,
is the ub.c USB storage driver supposed to work with multi-LUN(?)
devices? I have a Palm Tungsten T5, which in drive mode looks like two
USB storage devices (the internal flash is one LUN and the SD/MMC card in
the slot is another one). With usb_storage driver I can see both devices,
with ub driver I can see the internal flash only.
	I have moved back to usb_storage driver for now, but I am willing
to provide more info if somebody is interested in making ub.c driver working
with both devices on Tungsten T5.
	Thanks,
-Yenya
PS.: There is no MAINTAINERS file entry for the ub.c driver, and Pete Zaitcev
	is not even listed in the CREDITS file.
