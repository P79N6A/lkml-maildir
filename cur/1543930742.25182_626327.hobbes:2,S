In case anyone is interested in playing with this, I updated the fio
syslet engine to this interface. Not very well tested yet, but it seems
to work.
I have to say that I like the new interface a lot better, it's a lot
simpler to work with. I was able to cut about 33% of the code that
handles queueing IO and retrieving events (maybe even more, summed up
losely). I'm still not a big fan of the indirect stuff, but that's
minor.
You can get fio by doing a
$ git clone git://git.kernel.dk/fio.git
or just grabbing the latest snapshot from
http://brick.kernel.dk/snaps/fio-git-latest.tar.gz
