Subject: user-space quota & accounting package for new kernels?

Can someone here point me in the right direction to 'working' (ie, something that will
actually compile and run) set of user-space programs that will link in with the 2.2.*
kernel's BSD accounting, & quota support.
I've tried the quota-1.70 package on sunsite but this doesn't compile (probably due to
the glibc v2.1) looking for __32 and BS, BH, IS, IH.  for block & inode information.
I have another system running v2.0.36 here (gcc v2.7.2.3/ glibc 5.4.33) where I statically
compiled this and moved it over to the new system but then it dies when run as a non-root
user.  very strange..  I was unable to locate the author of the package to or even
a later copy.  the mini-howto is even more out-dated than the package (still going
to ftp.funet.fi which only has 1.51 and in a completely different path.
As for accounting I tried acct-1.3.73 but this doesn't seem to work.  It compiles
but when doing lastcomm or whatnot I show several duplicate entries for each command
plus the time-stamps are really funky.  (each line in the output goes for/back in time
by several hours if not days.  The only thing I can think of is that I'm on a dual 
processor system and commands might be registered differently (for the duplicate entries)
but that doesn't explain the time-stamps.  Anyway, this package as well is very dated and
no information as to author or a site for new code.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Sorry for wasting bandwidth on the kernel
list but if anyone would know it would probably be you guys as you've got to test the
functions in the kernel anyway to make sure they work.
