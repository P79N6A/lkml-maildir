you're right, I actually had it right in the first place, but stupidly
rewrote it to overflow C:-)
it should have been more or less:
unsigned long IV = loop_get_iv(lo,
  page->index * (PAGE_CACHE_SIZE >> LO_IV_SECTOR_BITS)
  + (offset - lo->lo_offset) >> LO_IV_SECTOR_BITS));
I'll be fixed in cryptoapi-2.4.3-hvr6 (see 
http://www.hvrlab.org/crypto/
)
oh, and btw, it should only concern file backed loop's... block devices,
as partitions, should have worked fine...

erm... I've looked at your patch... you do just the same thing as I do, as
it concerns 'changing the kernel'... but you do it in a 'static' way... I
want it to be changeable at runtime... and letting the way open to add
more IV calculation variants in the future, which every filter can choose
among at initialization...
