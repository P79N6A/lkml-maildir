Yes, the generic code was like that too.  It was causing lockups.  Sorry, I
did not realise that voyager had a private invalidatation implementation.
Officially smp_invalidate_needed should be a cpumask_t and
smp_invalidate_interrupt() should be using cpu_isset() rather than
open-coded bitops.  For all those 64-way voyagers out there ;)
(Actually it is legitimate: you may want to run a NR_CPUS=48 kernel on a
2-way voyager just for testing purposes).  I'll drop your patch in as-is,
and maybe Bill can take a look at cpumaskifying it sometime?
