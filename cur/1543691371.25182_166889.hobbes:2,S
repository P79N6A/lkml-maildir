2.4.22-ac1 has it. In mm/vmalloc.c. You cannot (well, I believe) use
any functions which take page array if pages were not allocated one
by one. Maybe you can try using page and page+1, but I'm under
impression that it will not work as expected, and that you'll hit
some BUG() somewhere.

Yes.

Unavailable outside of mm. You must use remap_page_range. And this function
can only remap memory which does not have its 'struct page' (i.e. MMIO on
PCI busses) or pages marked as Reserved. So if you want to use it on
regular memory, you must mark pages reserved... And then you have to do
black magic to correctly remove 'PageReserved' bit at correct time - if 
process does fork, and you'll clear this bit too early, you'll get
page_count < 0 and BUG(). If you'll do that too late, you'll leak memory.
vmmon did this in the past, but it was impossible to get it right under all
possible circumstances.
Other problem is that this functions is targeted for remapping userspace
addresses, not kernel space, and I would not trust this function for using
with from in kernel space. Definitely 2.6.x with 4G/4G patch will do bad
things.
