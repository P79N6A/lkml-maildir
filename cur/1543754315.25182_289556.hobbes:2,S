I haven't seen your other patch. Do you mean that with this patch, ppc64
stops using it's own gettimeofday implementation based on the CPU
hardware timebase ?
There are reasons why I plan to keep that. First, our implementation is
very efficient. It allows a timeofday computation without locks or
barriers thanks to carefully hand crafted data dependencies in the
operation. Second, we have an ABI issue here. For historical reasons, we
have this "systemcfg" data structure that can be mmap'ed to userland,
and which contains copy of some of the ppc64 internal time keeping
infos. Some userland stuff use it to implement a fully userland
gettimeofday (again, without barrier nor locks). This is done at least
by IBM's JVM. My still-to-be-merged vDSO patch will also use this for
the userland implementation of gettimeofday syscall itself.
