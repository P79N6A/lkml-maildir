i like this approach - it makes irqs more resource-alike and attaches 
them to a specific resource control group.
So if /cgroup/boot is changed to have less CPUs then the "default" irqs 
move along with it.
but if an isolated RT domain has specific irqs attached to it (say the 
IRQ of some high-speed data capture device), then the irqs would move 
together with that domain.
irqs are no longer a bolted-upon concept, but more explicitly managed.
[ If you boot-test it and if Paul agrees with the general approach then
  i could even apply it to sched-devel.git ;-) ]
