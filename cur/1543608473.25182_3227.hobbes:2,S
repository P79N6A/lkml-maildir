I was able to get 2.2.20 to compile by changing asm/pci.h line 62 to
"pci_hose_index" (s/host/hose/); see the struct definition at the top of
that file. Also I needed to add "#include <asm/errno.h>" to the same file to
get the definition of ENXIO... Be warned, I have not actually booted the
resulting kernel.
Are pci_hose_* really meant to be named like that, or was it an overzealous
search-and-replace?
Regards,
Dan
