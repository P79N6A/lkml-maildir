I don't fully understand the nature of this problem.  Is it that ub always
assigns the _first_ available minor number whereas add_disk() tries to
assign the _next_ available?  If so, how does tracking devices help?  
Shouldn't you just always want add_disk() to use the same minor number as 
ub?
Or maybe I've misunderstood completely, not just partially.  In any case,
are you sure you will want to do this?  The directive for not tracking 
serial numbers or trying in some other way to make devices appear to be 
persistent across reconnects came directly from Linus.
