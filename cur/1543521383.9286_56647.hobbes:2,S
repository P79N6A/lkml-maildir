Hmm. Shouldn't there also be some interface for handling actual I/O? That  
is, some sort of request queue interface?
As for ioctl: Yes, the current interface is a mess, but a simple I/O  
interface is not always a good equivalent.
I thought that in a recent discussion, an interface approximately like the  
following was found to be useful:
[User mode interface]
int devicecontrol(int filehandle, unsigned command,
                  size_t insize, void *inbuf,
                  size_t outsize, void *outbuf);
That is, the parameters clearly indicate which access is allowed to what  
memory, and how big buffers are. The old ioctl() interface could translate  
old calls to use the new interface. Using some tables would probably work.
Now, this particular patch is probably not the time to make that change,  
but it might be good to remind people ...
MfG Kai
