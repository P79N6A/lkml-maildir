Hi All,
I'm getting the "Busy inodes after unmount. Self-destruct in 5 seconds. Have 
a nice day..." message when trying to unmount initrd. It gets unmounted 
alright but the message is frightening.
The error message appears only if I've written something to a ramdisk (not 
initrd, to another one). For instance, the following commands in /linuxrc are 
enough to get the message:
#!/bin/ash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram6 count=1
exit
The real root file system is on a SCSI disk.
I've tried it with the 2.4.3, 2.4.9, 2.4.10-pre11 kernels - with the same 
results. Also, I added printouts to the fs/inode.c file (from one of the 
patches sent via this list some while ago) showing what inodes appear busy. 
It's a single unnamed inode, number 54, i_count equals to 1 and zero i_state.
Does anyone have any idea as to why this may happen and how to fix this?
Thanks,
Nick
