Hmmm 8390.o needs crc32.o (or maybe you built it into your kernel).
Could you please :
  - grep 8390.o /lib/modules/2.4.32/modules.dep
  - post the exact list of unresolved symbols that insmod outputs
  - grep 2 or 3 of them in /proc/ksyms (eg: printk)
  - post your .config so that we can find a way to reproduce your problem.

By the time you do this, it would also be interesting to retry without
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS. Oh, and please report your gcc and binutils versions
so that we can be as close as possible to your conditions when trying
to reproduce.
