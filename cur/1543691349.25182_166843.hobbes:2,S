1. If you have physical access to the machine you're screwed anyway (boot
   from a CD... if BIOS is password-protected just temporarily put the
   harddrive in another machine)
2. In the relatively rare cases that you have physical access to the console
   but not the machine (locked down kiosks or secured lab settings) you can
   (and should) secure the bootloader.  This prevents any malicious command
   line options (think "root=my.nfs.server:/toolkit") not just "init=".
So this patch is basically pointless.
