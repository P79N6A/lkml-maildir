Agreed...  though IMO that can handled by considering DMA S/G as just 
one more set of helper functions that the driver writer should not have 
to implement ;)  dma_sg_setup_mmap() could function as a peer alongside 
dma_setup_mmap(), mmio_setup_mmap(), etc.  Providing such to driver 
writers gives them incentive to use S/G lists as well as incentive not 
to invent their own mmap(2) setup and handling code.
