I'm pretty damn sure the relevant maintainers (and a bunch of people
on LKML and the netdev lists in general) would like to see patches
that improves their code.
If these friends of yours are sitting on patches that make massive
improvements to the code and they are not submitting patches then they
are not exactely helping (and I'd suspect them to just be full of BS)
- they should get their code merged instead of having to maintain it
themselves out-of-tree for ever - let the rest of us bennefit as well.
It's my experience that if you can explain the problems your patch fix
and explain well why the fix is sane, then getting your patches merged
doesn't have to be hard.
