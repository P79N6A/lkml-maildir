freezer_exempt() as of now does what its name says. I.e, exempt the
thread from all kinds of freeze chills.
But with more subsystems using the process freezer, the exemption needs
to be event specific. There may be threads which should not be frozen 
for say kprobes, should be frozen for cpu-hotplug. This selective
freezing is not yet available. But it will be soon...
