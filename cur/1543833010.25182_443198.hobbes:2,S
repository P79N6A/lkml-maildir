I did it on at least two occasions in the past, and someone else picked
it up and retried submitting it a third time, but it never got merged.
The problem with changes of this scale is they tend to be wide-reaching,
and impact areas which other people are patching, so it's something
that needs to go in as soon as the patch is done, or it becomes stale
very quickly.
It did make a noticable difference to compiles, though I forget the
exact numbers.   Should be in the list archives somewhere.
I have vague recollection that it shaved off around 20-30s, though
my memory is fuzzy.
