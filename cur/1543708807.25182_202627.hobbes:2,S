OK, you need to state that in simple terms at the very begining of your 
proposal in the future.  Otherwise many people won't understand you're 
asking for design help, and are just asking others to do what you want.
Also, fill in more details.  Take all of the ideas against your proposal 
in this thread, and write how they can be overcome.  You have to give 
enough detail so it will not be seen as a dismissal of said problem, and 
enough flexability for a design document.
Frankly, it might be better if you wrote an RFC with implementation details.
HTH,
Mike
