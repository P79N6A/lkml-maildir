Sure, but in that case, if we return "no worries, we have plenty of
memory", then we're opening ourselves up to the memory overrun problem
that was the original issue in the first place.  I suspect that the
underlying problem is that somewhere in the tty layer there is code
that is using receive_room() as permission to simply push that many
characters into the receive queue, instead of using that function as
an hint of how many characters would be profitable to feed into the
line discpline.
