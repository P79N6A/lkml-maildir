Oh, my idea was that only the range passed to ->commit() would be walked,
but any BH_New buffers (regardless of where they are in the page) would be
passed to the journal as well. So the logic would be:
for all the buffers in the page:
  If the buffer is new, or it is within the range passed to commit, pass to
  the journal.
Is there anything I'm still missing here?

We definitely agree. It's not intuitive that the range should change
between ->prepare_write() and ->commit_write() and IMHO, all the issues
we've found are good evidence that this particular approach will be
problematic.

Silly question - what's preventing a reader from filling the !uptodate page with disk
data while the writer is copying the user buffer into it?

It seems more realistic in that it makes sure the write is properly setup
before calling into the file system. What do you think is not as nice about
it?
