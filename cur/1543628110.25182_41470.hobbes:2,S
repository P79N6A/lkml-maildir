Subject: hdc: lost interrupt (only when ripping audio cd)

  I have a problem with cdrom burner, everything works except of ripping
audio cds - whenever I run some ripping program (I tried cdparanoia and
cdda2wav) I get the lost interrupt messages and it rips VERY slowly
(hours per song).
  here's the detailed info:
  system:
    hdc: TDK CDRW321040B, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
    Linux jojda 2.4.17 #1 Wed Mar 13 01:33:28 PST 2002 i686 unknown
    debian unstable
    VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C693A/694x (abit)
    kernel config: CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y
    dma access both on and off (same problem)
    32 bit access both on and off (same problem)
  the cdrom is a cd r/rw writer
  further testing (counter in ide-cd.c) showed that approximately 30-100
reads are OK, then one failure, 30-100 good reads, one failure (the
number of successfull reads fluctuates).
  as far as I can tell everything else works: burning cds, reading data
cds, playing audio cds. none of these activities have any influence on
ripping (and vice versa).
  another cdrom (reader only) on same ide (hdc) exhibits same symptoms,
HD on the same ide (hdc) works with no problems.
  I don't see any irq conflict... as long as it's data cd the count of
interrupts in /proc/interrupts goes up (so the interrupt is working fine
for data cd).
  BTW cd ripping works fine under windows, even though I've read that it
doesn't mean much because windows often pools hw instead of using IRQ.
  searching the web and kernel mailing list archives reveals that:
  - early 2.4.x kernels had some problems with ide and via motherboards
(different from the problem I have) - could this be some remnant of the
same problem?
  - there was one email that seemed to be relevant, there's no further
info on it though:
> From: Jens Axboe (axboe@image.dk)
...
> Does you drive otherwise work, except for the CDDA ripping?
> I might have a possible fix for this.
  in response to a problem somewhat similar to mine. the given thread
does not reveal any solution to a problem apart from the hint of hope
quoted above (Jens, are you listening?)
  any pointers as to what might be wrong and how to fix it?
  TIA
  here's info from /proc/interrupts and lspci, not sure what else might
be relevant:
