these should be fixed in -V0.7.24 which i uploaded shortly after
-V0.7.23, based on your reports. In any case, the export problems
trigger with CONFIG_HIGHMEM and the affected subsystems compiled as
modules.

great!

this might be a side-effect of the chrt-ing of events/[0|1] and/or
ksoftirqd (which we did to debug the 'freeze' problems) - are those
still chrt-ed? Please review and double-check all SCHED_FIFO tasks in
the system and keep only those that are absolutely necessary for
latencytest's operation [i.e. the soundcard IRQ and latencytest itself]
- everything else should be SCHED_OTHER. Do latencies get any better if
you do this?
