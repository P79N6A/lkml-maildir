Hello,
This set of 2 patches make Iwamoto-san's memory hotplug
prototype correspond to an IPF NUMA machines.
The patch is against linux 2.6.5 and works with 
Iwamoto-san's memory hotplug patch.
I don't have an IPF NUMA machine. So, I tested on 
Tiger4 (intel's IPF machine) with NUMA node
in emulation.
Changes from Iwamoto-san's patches are:
- Using SRAT for NUMA node.
- Structures of all nodes are initialized at boot.
  In Iwamoto-san's patch, node0 is initialized
  at boot, and after boot, all nodes except node0 are
  initialized by hot-add operation.
Patch Details:
- Patch(1/2) memory hotplug prototype for ia64
  The main patch.
- Patch(2/2) NUMA node emulation
  To emulate NUMA node on non-NUMA machines.
Remainder items:
The following items are being made.
- Support of HotAdd function.
- Correspond to ACPI's SLIT.
  So, it does not use find_next_best_node() function
  (mm/page_alloc.c) which added to linux 2.6.5.
- Support of hugetlbpage.
How to apply:
 1) First of all, apply Iwamoto-san's patches.
 2) Apply this set of patches.
Thank you,
Fumihiro Terasawa.
