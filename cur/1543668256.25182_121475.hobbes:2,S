Because everywhere else in the file {read,write}_lock_bh() is used 
instead of {read,write}_lock(), so I'm assuming that _bh is required 
but I really don't know why.
Anyway I have some critics over your patch: 
 - locking inside ipv6_add_addr() is simpler and more linear but
   semantically wrong because you're unable to tell the user why his 
   "ip addr add" failed.  E.g. you answer ENOBUFS instead of EEXIST.
 - your ipv6_chk_same_addr() does a useless check for (dev != NULL)

   your never "break" if dev == NULL, so you could return 0 before
   even acquiring the lock.
