1. You will need more documentation, eventually in Documentation directory.
2. Is there 1:1 relationship between ieee80211_device and net_device or 
    N net_devices per ieee80211_device?
3. Don't put a version number on the protocol messages. The way to
   us netlink is to us Type Length Variable structures. And write the
   code to ignore unknown types.  Once you decide on a particular Type
   then it has to be frozen for ABI compatibility.  The version numbering
   in the WE API is part of the problem
4. What about non-ieee80211 devices? With the growth of (mostly proprietary)
   cell phone carrier wireless, you don't want to shut out that.
