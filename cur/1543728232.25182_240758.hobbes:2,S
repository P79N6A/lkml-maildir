I'm not intending to patch the current implementation into the new
version; there are so many changes that it would make the process
extremely painful (as evolution would have been if it were really true).
Instead, I proposed, as Andrew requested to post a number of patches
simply adding the new version along side the old. When you're satisfied
that the new does everything the old does, I'm hoping we'll simply drop
the old version.
I'll start producing patches shortly, then.
Nigel

Many today claim to be tolerant. But true tolerance can cope with others
being intolerant.
