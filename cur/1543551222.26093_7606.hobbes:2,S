Strange.

These addresses looks suspicious to me. Do you have Phoenix BIOS? Or did
Linux kernel assign them to device?
Can you try 'video=matrox:init,sgram', eventually 
'video=matrox:init,sgram,memtype:X', where X is 0,1,2 or 4 ? (see 
Documentation/fb/matroxfb.txt for memtype explanation; if your G400
is expandable to 32MB, it is type 0 or 4; if it is not expandable,
it is memtype 1 or 2)
                                        Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
