And don't forget the cost of cluebats to beat the users over the head
with.  I've been trying for 3 years to get people to save their documents
to the H: drive.  Still find stuff stored wherever they feel like storing
it.
So each facility has a backup server that nightly grabs their entire
drive, gzip's it, and then dumps it to a DDS-4 tape.  Also keeps X days of
daily full backups, and X weeks as well.
Aside from Windows filesharing being so slow(1500kps via smbtar is average
here), it works quite nicely.  Even with a P4/2.53, I still can't get
more than the 1500kps that a p133 is capable of.  All the p4 gives me, is
the ability to gzip -9 or even bzip2 the files, instead of the gzip -1
that the p133 is capable of in real time.
