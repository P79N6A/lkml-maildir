This time, initial test results on -18PK (PREEMPT_DESKTOP, no IRQ
threading).
Again, results running cpu_delay and collecting user triggered traces.
[1] Similar symptoms where I do not get traces that span CPU's plus
the missing trace symptom.

I don't see a significant difference in failures to record when compared
with -18RT (7 vs. 8).
[2] I get no ksoftirqd activity (as expected).
[3] Long sequences of one CPU only was seen again. Though in looking
at these traces I find several incomplete ones like this:

I assume that since it does not start with user_trace_start (or something
like that) that the missing portion is the first portion.
[4] Not sure if I can make the same comment on -18PK as I did for -18RT
on changing CPU's [since I understand we do not have the opportunity to
do so unless the IRQ's are threaded].
[5] The trace output cosmetic problems are on PREEMPT_DESKTOP as well.
Traces to come shortly in a separate message.
