The application _IS_ using aio, which is why it can go and perform other 
work while it waits to be told that the read has completed.  This is not 
possible with mmap because the task is blocked while faulting in pages, 
and unless it tries to access the pages, they won't be faulted in.

Being blocked in the page fault handler means the cpu is now idle 
because you can't go chew on data that _IS_ in core.  The aio + O_DIRECT 
allows you to control when IO is started rather than rely on the kernel 
to decide when is a good time for readahead, and to KNOW when that IO is 
done so you can chew on the data.

You have this completely backwards.  With mmap this is what you get 
because you chew data, page fault... chew data... page fault...

Ever hear of error recovery?  A good db will be able to cope with one or 
two bad blocks, or at the very least continue operating the other tables 
or databases it is hosting, or flush transactions and switch to read 
only mode, or any number of things other than abort().

Sure... now what does your signal handler have to do in order to handle 
this error in such a way as to allow the one request to be failed and 
the task to continue handling other requests?  I don't think this is 
even possible, yet alone clean.

Or use aio.  Simple read/write with the kernel trying to outsmart the 
application is nice for very simple applications, but it does not 
provide very good performance.  This is why we have aio and O_DIRECT; 
because the application can manage the IO better than the kernel because 
it actually knows what it needs and when.
Yes, the application ends up being more complex, but that is the price 
you pay.  You simply can't get it perfect in a general purpose kernel 
that has to guess what the application is really trying to do.

Then redesign those applications to use aio and O_DIRECT.  Incidentally 
I have hacked up dd to do just that and have some very nice performance 
numbers as a result.

Nobody has shown otherwise to date.
