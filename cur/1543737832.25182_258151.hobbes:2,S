This can happen, and is fully to be expected. For a host of reasons the
packet might not in fact appear. Whenever using select for non-blocking IO
always set your sockets to non-blocking as well.
One of the legitimate reasons is the reception of packets which, on copying,
turn out to have a bad checksum.
Stevens has a section on this, recommended reading.
