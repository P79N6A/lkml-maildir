after i reviewed this work with zach last summer, he and i also agreed 
that it would be best if i did this work after the generic changes are 
integrated -- so he wouldn't have to work on, and possibly break, the 
NFS client.
i have been watching the multi-segment iovec work since then, and fully 
intended to add the support for readv/writev aio in the NFS direct path 
when the generic support becomes available.
