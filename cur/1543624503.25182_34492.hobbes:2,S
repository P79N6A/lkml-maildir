If I was to give this patch a name it would be:
"Vojtech Pavlik unleashed from the chains".
So credit where credit is due :-).
BTW> There never was any ide-clean-20.
I have compressed it just to get it through linux-kernel,
becouse I would rather like it to reach any interrested party.
Please excuse me for the inconvenience.
Anyway here follows the change log:
Mon Mar 11 23:48:28 CET 2002 ide-clean-21
- Swallow rewritten amd74xx host chip setup code from Vojtech Pavlik.  We can
   revert it easly if it turns out to be a bad thing. However the code looks
   quite sane to me. In esp. it doesn't containg that many magic numbers.
- Clean stale white spaces in ide-timing.h tirvial fix.
- Make ide_release_dma return void. It's value is never used anyway.
- Swallow more timing setup code cleanup by Vojtech Pavlik. Apply some
   cosmetics to it. Port opti621 to the new setup code.
- Kill abuse of ide_do_reset() on error return paths for atapi floppy tape and
   cd-rom devices. Just stop them. This gives better changes that defect
   removable media will not cause suddenly broken timings on hard discs
   containing system data! Even then comments in ide_do_reset() admit, that
   resetting the whole channel can have adverse effects on the second interface
   on this channel. And I have too frequently observed linux struggling on
   defect cd-rom for a far too long time to wish it to continue.
   Oh did I forget to say that the corresponding "how can I break my system fast
   and reliable" ioctl is gone as well?
   Removing it recovered the fact that the CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_TIMEOUT is
   completely bogous. I have removed this option therefore as well, because it's
   playing the same wrack havoc on the devices if enabled. This cat has been in
   an unfinished and *unfunctional* state anyway.
- Actually add physical suspend code to the power handling code.  Still the
   resume code isn't finished just jet. This is all subject to change at the
   point in time when we get to proper command queueing.
   I think however that Pavel will be interrested in tidding this bit up...
- Resync with 2.5.7-pre1.
