This is incorrect, alright, but not because of any of the reasons James
mentions below.
The only reason why some module (or Kconfig option) should _depend_
on some other Kconfig option is if (*and only if*) it re-uses _code_
exported by said dependency.
In this particular case, SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC=y/n only controls the
default value of some variable somewhere in SCSI, so no other code
can meaningfully "depend" on it.

Umm, this isn't true, actually.

I think the _correct_ way to handle this situation (and which would make
everyone happy here; Robert can get his module-free builds with defconfig,
James gets his SCSI_WAIT_SCAN module even if nobody asked for it
explicitly) would be as follows:
