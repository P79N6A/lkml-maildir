The security arguments with the 32-bit UID stuff are kind of iffy.
My patches try to fix things up in as secure a manner as possible, but if
you have >65535 users on your system, you really need to be running all
glibc-based daemons. (and hopefully your programs running as root used
uid_t and not unsigned short internally)

NFS = No File Security.
Unfortunately, using NFS opens you up to far more attacks than just this
one. If you use NFS for any purpose other than unprivileged, read-only
exports, you are in trouble if there is any sort of public access to your
network. (public access meaning that an untrusted party can run a sniffer
and send packets) That's just the way it is going to be until we are all
using Kerberos NFS or NFS over SSL.

I've tested the kernel NFS server + Linux 2.2 with my 32-bit UID patches
and everything seemed to work fine.
A colleague of mine is using it in a production environment with 32-bit
UIDs to share a RAID array between a bunch of hosts, and so far I haven't
heard of any problems.

The NFS code has been a state of flux for a while. Hopefully, these issues
will be looked at as the knfsd updates, etc. get into 2.3.

As would I.
