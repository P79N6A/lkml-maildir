Which ones?-)  I suspect that since it is several that at least answers 
the MSI_X question right?  Or is it possible to have a single device 
have several MSI interrupts?

I am very clueless as to the design considerations under which Neptune 
was designed, but given that Neptune is based (IIRC) on the same "in 
core" 10G stuff as Sun talks about being in the UltraSPARC-T2 
processors, there is the possibility the design center was somewhat 
different then what one sees in an 8P Opteron system, whether it carries 
a Sun logo or not.  From what I've learned thusfar 8P Opteron systems 
are "interesting" beasts with what I suspect are rather different 
constraints and behaviours than an UltraSPARC-T[12] system.
What I was asking about was more a block diagram showing via which 
sockets the given I/O slots were connected.

If you decide to go the netperf route, feel free to contact me directly 
with netperf questions, or via the netperf-talk mailling list on 
netperf.org.
