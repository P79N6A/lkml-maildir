Ok. Thanks... But it's not my case. Article talks about ata-133 not
ata-100..

I had 2.4.7 kernel, it was working just fine for me... Then I changed it to
2.4.18/2.4.19-preX
(with all problems I wrote about).

It's a little bit hard for non-kernel developer to track changes between 10
kernel versions, sorry :(

As I wrote already... I'm in process of changing hardware... and office
location.

Sure.. But I reported problem as I've seen it in kernel logs.

2.4.7 Sorry, it's old enough, but usually I don't change kernel till it
works...

Actually, no need to do this. As I wrote I'm changing hardware and will try
to avoid promise, via, and may be ide :)
Hope it solves the problem :) at least for me.
