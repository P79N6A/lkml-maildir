I agree that it's desiderable to move buffers to the freelist but you
should at least also check the reference count while instead my approch
make no assumption on the correctness of the set_blocksize caller code.
And I really don't think it will make big difference, this is why I think
that the lazy approch will be just fine.

Starting from the second run of the loop bh is == bhnext. But bhnext is
been moved from the dirty list to the clean list while we was sleeping in
wait_on_buffer(). So without my patch we could continue browsing the clean
list instead of continue to browse the dirty list.
