I know this is different from the original hexdump in ide-scsi.c, I
just want to tell someone that there's a good implementation of
hexdump in kernel.h, and I think the default KERN_DEBUG and
print_hex_dump is more informative and has better output. However,
anyone want more precise control on debug message could make her/his
improvements with print_hex_dump.
