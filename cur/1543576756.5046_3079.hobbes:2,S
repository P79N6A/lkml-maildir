But we should, and something that does it is buried in Chris Mason's
patch under the thread [RFC] changes to buffer.c.  Chris is also trying
some other fancy things in that patch, but the buffer cache mapping part
is actually pretty simple.
For buffer cache pages I think the current thinking is that PG_dirty
should stay on until the last dirty buffer on the page has been
submitted for writing.
