As I said, you can't allow it to be interrupted after you've started the 
copy_to_user(). Show me how the userspace program can prove the signal 
arrived _after_ the 'int 0x80' had trapped into the kernel rather then 
beforehand, and I'll accept that you can't allow read() to be interrupted
even before the copy_to_user() starts.
But I also agree that there are other, better, examples of why
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE has to be used sometimes. Page faults in 
copy_{from,to}_user are probably one such.
It's just that it doesn't have to be scattered all over the place just
because people are too lazy to do the cleanup code.
Yeah -- sometimes it's hard. So go shopping.
