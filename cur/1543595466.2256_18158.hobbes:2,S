One useful thing to try would be to try the old aic7xx driver (say N to 
aic7xxx and it will offer you the old one). Clearly if the aic7xxx_old driver
works then it is rather good information.
Except for an obscure bug under very high memory load I'm not aware of any 
outstanding bugs in the AIC7xxx driver, certainly not like you describe. There
is however always a first time for any bug 8)
