And you should've read the rest of mine. Just because the clock
generator is 14.3MHz doesn't mean that's what the bus runs at -- all
signals a relative to BCLK, which is 4.77MHz, 8Mhz, or 8.33Mhz (or 6, or
10, by Alan's last post).
By your logic, the PCI bus in my PIII machine runs at 100MHz because
it's divided down from the 100MHz Front Side Bus.
