Sure.  The time to seek halfway across the disk, probably.

I'd been thinking more like 20, but it really depends on the manufacturer.  
(And fun little detail, faster seeks can take MORE power, driving the coil 
thingy harder...)

I.E. they've already dealt with this problem in existing designs that use 
some variant of a spring to park, this is Not Our Problem.
No, the "not worth it" above, in addition to the extra logic to unjournal the 
stuff on the next boot (and possibly lose power again during bootup and 
hopefully not wind up with a brick) , is that the platter slows down if you 
don't keep it spinning.  If the spring is seeking slowly, the capacitor has 
to keep the platter spinning longer, which could easily eat the power you're 
trying to avoid seeking with.  Add in the extra complexity and it doesn't 
seem worth it, but that's for the lab guys to decide with measurements...
Oh, and one other fun detail.  One reason I don't like the "battery backed up 
SRAM cache", apart from being another way the disk dies of old age, is that 
it doesn't fix the "we lost power in the middle of writing a sector, so we 
just created a CRC error on the disk" problem, which is what started this 
thread.
If you're going to fix THAT (which you seem to need a capacitor to do 
anyway), then you might as well do it right.
