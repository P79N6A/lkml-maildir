In my experience, if it sucks, it'll be part of the ABI and can't be
removed without breaking userspace code (to wit, /proc/{pid}/smaps,
whose only likely widespread user has declared it too horribly-formatted
to use (i.e. acahalan and procps), but it's still there...)
Stuff in /proc/{pid}/ doesn't die easily...
