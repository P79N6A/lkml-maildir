I remember that I used to be a sysadmin with some NetApp boxes that have 
a .snapshot directory that is invisible, and has special qualities.
It worked.  There were no namespace collision problems.  None.
These things can be survived by users.;-)
Nothing I say should be construed to mean that I think that a particular 
name for a pseudo-file implemented by the default regular directory 
plugin is what should ship.  I am easy in such matters.  You can also 
get me to agree it should be modifiable, so that if Joe Sevenpack needs 
a file named ..archive, he can have it.

Both.  If you want a file named '..glob' that does the same thing as
'..archive', go for it.  I am not necessarily committed to putting 
..archive in the default directory plugin (actually, I don't like that 
name, it should be something snappier, but I haven't thought of it).  I 
also am not funded to implement ..archive at the moment (I am funded to 
do inheritance though) .

read, write, etc., on file.html/..joes_attribute, unless it is a 
particular attribute that has particular effects on the particular 
plugin for file.html, in which case it all depends on the plugin and the 
constraints imposed on joes_attribute.  It may be that modifying 
file.html modifies ..joes_attribute as a side-effect, plugins can do 
anything in response to a VFS operation.  You put the plugin into your 
kernel, you'd better be able to trust it....

If you have permission, you can:
cat /foo/..bar
Or you can use the efficient for small files API we are implementing, 
which I won't go into here.
