At the moment no. I guess when Linus will take patches :-)

I wouldn't say obsolete. The input stuff just got syned to the -dj tree.
So ruby and -dj tree are almost the same in this case. I'm going to work
on drivers/char/keyboard.c today to make it work with the input layer
directly instead of going threw keybdev.c in drivers/input then pc_keyb.c 
as it does now. It still will work the old way tho as well. Thsi is for
the keyboard drivers not ported over to the input api.
NOTE: keyboard maintainers please move your drivers over to the input api. 
It will speed up the transition.
As for the fbdev layer. Their was way to much code to cleanup and maintain
in sync. So ruby had hardly any fbdev ported over :-( Now I'm spending the
time to port every single fbdev driver over. Alot of work but it is
needed.

The correct fix is to do something like fb_info.node = NODEV;

Oh. That will not be fixed for awhile in the upper console layers. I did
have a fix for those sort of problems.

Right now the changes have been the moving of fb_blank from struct fb_info
to struct fb_ops. I placed xxfb_setcolreg into struct fb_ops. I just sent
a patch in to remove struct fbcon_cmap and use instead pseudo_palette in
struct fb_info. I now have every driver compiled with fbgen.c. This allows
us to use one function at a time in fbgen.c. Right now most drivers use
do_install_cmap and fbgen_set_cmap in fbgen.c instead of their own
functions.
