Hate? No this isn't applicable here. I think it's just a very 
twisted idea with really ugly results.
However all the objections against any kind of a special purpose FS
can be compressed to the following:
"Why the hell doesn't
tar cf my_system.tar /
work?"
In fact last time I have tryed (ok it's a lot of time ago) 
it turned out to be the most trivial DOS attack out there.
