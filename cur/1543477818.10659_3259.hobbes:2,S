Well, a week after stating that no development kernel that I've used (121,
128, 129, 130pre2, 131, 132ac(3|5|6|11|13), 2.2.0pre(4|5ac1)) has ever
crashed on me in any way, shape or form pre6 crashed on me. It crashed
hard enough that no sysreq I tried did anything, I couldn't flip to
console and I couldn't apply the vulcan nerve pinch. This could have
something to do that maybe init crashed...
Anyways, the downside of the above was that I had to manually write down
what the oops was. The downside of that is that I've almost forgotten
how to write due to the amount of typing I do. anyways, on with the bug
report:

No I don't know how to trace that mess. :) Near as I can figure it used the
may 9 ld.so which means it's a precompiled ld from redhat 5.1 (the system
is a slightly butchered version of that distro - I like my tarballs :).
Text before oops:
BUG IN DYNAMIC LINKER: ld.so: ../sysdeps/i386/dl-machine.h: 381: elf_machine_rel: Assertion `!"unexpected dynamic reloc type"; failed!
The above was repeated 3 times in one console after I logged in on tty 2
and before I got my bash prompt. Selecting tty 3 produced a whole heap of
those and the oops. Logins on tty's 1 and 11 were fine. tty 1 was running
screen 3.7.4, tf and was attempting a telnet connection. tty 11 was running
screen also, pppd and tail -f on the msgs logfile. it was also running
rc5des in another window of the screen. After the above was repeated
many times on the screen the following was printed followed by the oops:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0018a044
current->tss,cr2=07fdd000, %cr3-07fdd000
*pde=00000000
Oops: 0000
etc...
The ksymoopsed oops report is as follows: hope I did it right. First time.

1 warning issued.  Results may not be reliable.
The warning was: Warning in compare_ksyms_lsmod, module bsd_comp is in lsmod but not in ksyms, probably no symbols exported
The kernel was compiled with the above mentioned egcs with the same
options. The kernel contains no modules other then those required
by pppd.
If you need any more help, like the .config file, just holler.
I hope this was useful.

    There was farting in the air that night,
        It lit so bright,
