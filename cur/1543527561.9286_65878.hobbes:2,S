Hi,
  (Linux/Alpha on LX164 board)
I'm seeing instability of 2.3.47:
  1) Seen in /var/log/messages: BUG IN DYNAMIC LINKER ld.so:
dynamic-link.h: 57: elf_get_dynamic_info: Assertion `! "bad dynamic tag"'
failed!
  2) 10-20 second pause where the whole machine (including keyboard/mouse)
stopped for a few seconds and then recovered.
  3) A .tar.gz of a locally created file which exited with a CRC error
during the decompression.
Dave
