As a maintainer, you should mark the sources with your Email
address. That way people can contact you when they find a bug.
As "someone who has found a bug" you are expected to contact the
maintainer by Email. If you don't get a reply in a week, it is
appropriate to perform a quick "who's where" or "bigfoot" search, to
see if this Email address has become stale. If a week later there
still isn't any answer, it becomes appropriate to post the patch
together with a remark like "Does anybody know where .... went?"
When that doesn't turn up an active maintainer, I guess you're
welcome to take over.
