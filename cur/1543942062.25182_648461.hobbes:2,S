Subject: [2.6.24 regression][BUGFIX] numactl --interleave=all doesn't works on memoryless node.

Hi Lee-san
I change subject because 2.6.24 reproduce too.

unfortunately it doesn't works on my test environment ;-)
				numactl-orig		numactl-with-lee-patch
	2.6.24			  failed		  failed
	2.6.24-rc8-mm1		  failed		  failed
I got below error messages by all case.
	$ numactl --interleave=all ls
	set_mempolicy: Invalid argument
	setting interleave mask: Invalid argument
I think kernel is need changed too.
I attached bellow.
kernel2.6.24-rc8-mm1 + mypatch + numactl-1.0.2 + leepatch works good.

OK, I cancel my previous has_high_memory patch.
and, I understood anyone doesn't use 32bit numa.

Agreed.

this is good news for me :)
I'll wait his patch post.
