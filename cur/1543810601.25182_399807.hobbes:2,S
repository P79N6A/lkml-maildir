The above comment in alloc_percpu regarding use of for_each_online_cpu
probably refers to the fact that once we handover 'pdata' to the caller
of alloc_percpu, there is no way to go back and fix it (i.e allocate
objects) for CPUs that come online later. This could have been possible if 
alloc_percpu kept track of all per-CPU allocations (chain togther all pdata's 
in a linked list?), but I guess they didn't do it to keep it simple.
I would say the code in kernel/profile.c is fine enough to emulate.
