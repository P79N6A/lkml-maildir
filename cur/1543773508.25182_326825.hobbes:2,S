Various people have sent me things in the past few days: thanks, it is
queued for now.
There's a lot of stuff in -mm to go through (I'll put a summary out soon). 
For now, I'm concentrating on cleaning up the diffs and changelogs, poking
reviewers, stabilisation, testing and, once the various subsystem
maintainers (Greg) have done thir bit, merging.
I'll be looking for things to drop, too - it's getting a bit crazy.
