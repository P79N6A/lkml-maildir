Hi Manuel,
I noticed you've opened a thread about this at both V4L ML and LKML. The
better place for you is to discuss this issue at V4L ML. LKML is very
generic and just a very small group of people working with those devices
could help you. Those are also listening at V4L, among with several
other guys.

Maybe the windows driver you took may be using the same VBI algorithm as
the Linux driver.

I suspect it is just a matter of proper settings.
The bttv hardware only provide "raw VBI". It means that it will return
to a program whatever stuff were sent during VBI (*). 
(*) VBI is a timing interval that exists at analog transmissions between
the end of one line and the start of another. It were meant to give some
time to the electron beam to move from one line to another.
For BTTV driver, you just set-up to adquire VBI or not. There are some
standard-based definitions, like the expected VBI intervals, and the
interval where VBI collect starts.
The hard work is doing at software decoding level, where a filtering
process takes place, to analise if the patterns makes some sense,
according with some specification, like teletext. If it makes sense, the
decoding occurs.
Maybe your board is collecting VBI sooner (or later) than expected, and
this is causing the missfunction of your userspace app.
Anyway, Michael Schimek send you some glues at V4L ML. He is one of the
authors of those VBI decoding tools. So, I'm sure he can guide you to a
proper solution.
Cheers,
Mauro
