Ah so.

With respect to GFP_ATOMIC, __GFP_HIGH has no flexibility, as they are
#defined to be the same thing.
With respect to __GFP_WAIT, if we only ever use it exactly when
we don't use __GFP_HIGH aka GFP_ATOMIC, then there is a definite
downside.  My old brain doesn't fold constants nearly as reliably or
rapidly as a compiler.  Every apparent degree of freedom that is unused
wastes a few of my remaining precious neurons understanding it.
It directly leads to such bugs as the one I noted in my last reply,
when I realized that checking cpusets in the 'ignoring mins' case
was bogus.
__GFP_HIGH has a second cost - it is easily confused with __GFP_HIGHMEM.

Good.
