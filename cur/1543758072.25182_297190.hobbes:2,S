I've noticed most of the new AMD64 chipsets now include integrated
marvell GigE and wifi chips onboard.  I haven't been able to find much
on the status of linux support for these chips.  Apparently the PCIE
GigE chip only works with sk98lin and not skge:

Does anyone know if support for the chip is being added to skge?  The
88W8310 doesn't seem to be supported at all, at least not that I can
see.  Does anyone know the status of the 88W8310?  Are there any
experimental drivers?  Is Marvell friendly to opensource?  Are the
databooks available?
Thanks,
Alex
