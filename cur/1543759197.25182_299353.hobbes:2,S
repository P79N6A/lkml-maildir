I've been doing a lot of research on this, and I keep coming up with things 
that don't work, have been abandoned, or are almost impossible to find or get 
working.  So I'll ask here.  Maybe one of the ultra-elightened linux gods 
will have a ready answer.
I want to be able to audit system calls - I want to log when files are opened, 
created, changed, deleted, etc.  Preferably I would like to do it without 
having to apply kernel patches, using vanilla (or close to vanilla) kernel.  
If this isn't possible, my net preference is to use a module.  If this isn't 
possible, well, I'll do what I have to.
I notice there is a CONFIG_AUDIT option.  Is this what I am looking for, and 
how do I use it?  /dev/audit seems not to work...
Thanks.  If you can even point me a suitable FM to R, I'd be content.
