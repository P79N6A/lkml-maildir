Thinking about it from the drive side. If the drive wcache is off then
you have barrier semantics anyway. 
So the logic is something like
has-flush	cache-on		barrier semantics
no-flush	cache-on		random semantics
no-flush	cache-off		barrier semantics
					(the barrier itself is a nop)

Agreed. Unfortunately a lot of users are getting burned by journalling
fs's and IDE write caching. As the caches get bigger the risk gets
bigger. SCSI turns it off (and prints a message) so I'd rather see the
write_cache() changed to something like "write_cache_verbose()" and the
printk done than the issue ignored for longer.
