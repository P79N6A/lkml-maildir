OK, the possibilities are
	* you've discovered a bug in all Unices (BTW, even FreeBSD *does*
allow to break out of some chroots in that fashion; RTFS and you'll see -
just pay attention to setting fdp->fd_jdir logics in kern/vfs_syscalls.c:
change_root(); it sets jail boundary on _first_ chroot and if you've got
nested chroots, you can leave them just fine by use of SCM_RIGHTS to hold
directory descriptor).  All hail David, nevermind that this behaviour had
been described in Unix FAQs since _way_ back.
	* you've misunderstood the purpose of chroot(), the fact that
behaviour in question is at the very least extremely common on Unix and
the fact that any code relying on root-proof chroot(2) is broken and needs
to be fixed, simply because chroot is _not_ root-proof on (at least) almost
all systems.
Note that the last statement applies in both cases; it's simply reality.
Insisting that behaviour known for decades is a bug since it contradicts
your rather convoluted reading of the standards...  Looks rather silly,
IMO, but that has zero practical consequences anyway.  Userland code can't
rely on root-proof chroot(2), period.
