Hi Ralf & others,
I found & fixed kernel bug in unaligned.c which was affecting the iptables code 
in little mips32 endian.
The patch is against 2.4.17 on oss.sgi.com & should hopefully apply to the latest
kernel.
The fixes code for I did mips 64 is untested, I had no way to test them unfortunately.
An example of the bug is the bug following sequence of mips instructions
beqz        v0,<destaddr>
lw          v0,(t3) 
say reg t3 points to an unaligned address
In the emulation the v0 register was being loaded & modified before
the computation of the destination address ( which depended on v0 ) 
this was incorrect so I had to save the updating of the v0 register
until the computation of the destination address was done.
