Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Create and populate toplevel tests/ for kernel tests
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following series of patches create and populate the toplevel tests/
directory. This will henceforth be the place where all in-kernel tests
live.
All patches against 2.6.25-rc1 and are just code movement without any
change in functionality.
