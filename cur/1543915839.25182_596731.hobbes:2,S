 GCC used to complain: "`foo' might be used uninitialized..." and this is 
the usual cure; let me see if this not the case anymore (I have 4.1.2).

 Yes of course, barring the issue mentioned.  Note the message above is 
not the same as: "`foo' is used uninitialized..." that would be reported 
in the case which you are concerned of.

 TURBOchannel is currently MIPS only:
$ grep PMAG arch/mips/configs/*
arch/mips/configs/decstation_defconfig:# CONFIG_FB_PMAG_AA is not set
arch/mips/configs/decstation_defconfig:CONFIG_FB_PMAG_BA=y
arch/mips/configs/decstation_defconfig:CONFIG_FB_PMAGB_B=y
