sigh ... you're right.  here's a thought.  my original patch
submission simply added an explanation for allowing the ({ }) notation
for defining a multi-line macro, without getting into recommending an
actual coding style.  at a minimum, something like that should be
added to the style document.
if someone wants to extend that explanation recommending *when* each
of those two styles should be used, feel free.  but a simple
decription of alternatives should *at least* be added, no?
