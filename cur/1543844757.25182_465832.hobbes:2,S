There is a very simple litmus test for DRM code: code that cannot be
altered or removed, according to applicable law or other agreements.
The GPLv3 could forbid the addition of such code to a covered code
base, I suppose.  However, this runs contrary to the DRM-like optional
clauses in the GPLv3 (mandatory access through sources over a
communication channel, certain forms of copyright notices).
I think several of these optional clauses are bad.  Even the copyright
notices can be annoying (although it's already in GPLv2).  For
instance, if I run
  emacs somefile.c
from the command line, somefile.c doesn't show up on in the editor,
but the copyright notice.  Of course, you can put 
  (defun display-splash-screen () (interactive))
in a startup file, but if you do this as a distributor, it might be a
GPLv2 violation.
