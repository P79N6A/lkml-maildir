Do you think that's common? I considered this while writing the code,
but figured it was just a oddball case not worth caring about.
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC does not call this normally anyways and people
should not call this for unallocated mappings anyways.

That will work for pci-gart, but not for some future users of set_memory_np()
I plan to submit (they run potentially with multiple CPUs online and doing callbacks
there would be quite ugly). So I would prefer  if you kept some variant of my original patch.
