Argh, this is *still* not fixed in -rc4!  How loud does one have to yell
to get an absolutely FATAL bug with a trivial fix merged?
Lots of people spent lots of time trying to track this bug down.  I
would hate to think all that time was wasted.  *Please* apply Roger's
patch, or many people will be unable to upgrade to 2.6.8.  I am getting
tired of replacing via-rhine.c with the version from -mm every time I
compile a new kernel just to keep my network card working.
