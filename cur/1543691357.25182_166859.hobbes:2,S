IIRC those changes were added to 2.5 by David. Architecture like Ia64
and Alpha support error return via a different register set ( $19 for
Alpha ). But syscalls like ptrace can have negative return value for
successful returns. So in that particular case $19 is forced to be zero
to indicate it is a successful return. IIUC
force_successful_syscall_return  is a wrapper around doing that. On
alpha actually r0 in the stack (regs.r0 ) is made zero which is  read in
entry.S and put in $19.
