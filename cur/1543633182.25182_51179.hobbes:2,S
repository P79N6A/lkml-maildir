Long ago, it was considered OK to use the kernel headers
in app code. This is the case with Linux 2.0 and libc 5.
(it used to be OK to symlink /usr/include/linux into an
unmodified copy of the Linux kernel source)
There has been a weak effort to avoid breaking libc 5.
Using __KERNEL__ might make it easier to provide cleaned
headers for user code.
There has been talk of removing __KERNEL__ usage from
some of the header files.
