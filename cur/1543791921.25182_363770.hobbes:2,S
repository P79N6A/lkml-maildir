Thank you very much, Fawad.
I do additional test by follow codes, the result is strange.
========================================
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
static int noop(void *dummy)
{
	int i = 0;
	while(i++ < 10) {
		printk("current->mm = %p\n", current->mm);
		printk("current->active_mm = %p\n", current->active_mm);
		set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
		schedule_timeout(HZ);
	}
	return 0;
}
static void create_thread(void *dummy)
{
	kernel_thread(noop, NULL, CLONE_KERNEL | SIGCHLD);
}
static struct work_struct work;
static int test_init(void)
{
	INIT_WORK(&work, create_thread, NULL);
	schedule_work(&work);
	return 0;
}
/*
static int test_init(void)
{
	kernel_thread(noop, NULL, CLONE_KERNEL | SIGCHLD);
	return 0;
}
*/
static void test_exit(void) {}
module_init(test_init);
module_exit(test_exit);
========================================
If use kernel_thread like above. the output is:
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = dffd2640
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = df4d50e0
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = df4463c0
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = df4d50e0
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = c16ee3e0
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = df4463c0
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = c16ee3e0
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = c16ee3e0
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = df796380
current->mm = 00000000
current->active_mm = c16ee3e0
if use kernel_thread directly in module_init(...). the output is:
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
current->mm = df988060
current->active_mm = df988060
Would you please do some explanation.
Best Regards
