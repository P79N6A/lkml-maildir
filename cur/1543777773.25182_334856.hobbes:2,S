The road to bloatness is paved with lots of little features.
There aren't that many users anyway (none of the examples use that 
feature). I'd prefer to concentrate on a simple and correct relayfs layer 
and we can still think about other features as more users appear.
Starting a design by implementing every little feature which _might_ be 
needed is a really bad idea.
bye, Roman
