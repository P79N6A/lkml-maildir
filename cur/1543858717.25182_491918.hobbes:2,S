not in the locking model i outlined earlier, which would turn it into a 
read-lock in essence.

actually, we use two things here: cpu_online_map and the per-cpu keventd 
workqueues. cpu_online_map is pretty much attached to the CPU hotplug 
subsystem so it would be quite natural to use cpu_hotplug_read_lock() 
for that.
so i disagree that CPU hotplug locking should be per-subsystem. We 
should have one lightweight and scalable primitive that protects 
cpu_online_map use, and that same primitive can be used to protect other 
per-CPU resources too.
