Thanks for the thanks. We don't have a way to tweak the .config per test 
currently.
The .config is adjusted automagically for the machine type.
However, there is a workaround. The PLM supports chains of patches, so you
could do a short diff from -ck3 with only the switch changes, and that
can be applied to -ck3 (PLM #768) automagically by the PLM. 
If you aren't yet up on the PLM, i'd be glad to do the submitting if you
send me the diff.
