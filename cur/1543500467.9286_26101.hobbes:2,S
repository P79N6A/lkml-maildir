Only on ATX4 - which I can't use (see below).

Yep, I can handle that part, it is the hardware switch that I
don't have time to experiment with.

I can just grep /proc/net/dev for ppp0 also.

Message waiting notification changes the dialtone from constant
to intermittent, which makes the modem detect no dialtone when
there is one - it is just intermittent.  I've yet to see a modem
that detects this intermittent tone as a dialtone.

No, the modem works fine, it is the different dialtone.  It can
be disabled at the phone company, but that is not what I want.

It's either that, or no telephone then.  I don't want people
picking up the phone and disrupting my online status.  I rewired
the whole house by flipping the wires and making a special Y
cable that plugs into the modem.  Now when the modem is ONLINE,
*ALL* telephones are dead and cannot disrupt the modem.
This has worked perfectly for 4 years.  As for the modem
disconnecting a voice call, I've never seen it happen.  I've seen
a few modems toggle the relay when resetting, but this didn't
disconnect the voice call.  At any rate I don't need to worry
about that.

That would be great!  I figured a few rectifiers, a zener, and
a few other parts should do it, but I've been away from
electronics for a few years and don't have the time to fiddle.
If you come up with something, I'd be very greatful indeed!
Thanks in advance.
