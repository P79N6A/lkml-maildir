On the surface, multi-path routing sounds complicated to me, while
layer-2 bonding seems relatively trivial to set up/administer.  Since we do
support bonding, if it's a simple fix to make it better, we
might as well do that, eh?
I haven't used either, so this is just idle supposition on my part...
