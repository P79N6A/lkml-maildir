Subject: [PATCH] BAD data corruption in -pre5 - it's really urgent.

	Linus, there is a problem with -pre{4,5} - it's partially my
fault, since I just left the thing in FYI status (I intended to submit the
patch when I will be sure that it works). Please, apply the following to
fs/buffer.c:
@@ -1449,6 +1449,8 @@
                err = copy_from_user(kaddr+from, buf, to-from);
        if (to < zeroto)
                memset(kaddr+to, 0, zeroto-to);
+       else
+               zeroto = to;
        if (err < 0)
                goto out;
        /*
Explanation: zeroto is left 0 if there is no new buffers partially written 
within a page. In that case it fails to dirty any buffer - with obvious
results. Fixed variant (that's what was posted for testing on l-k) didn't
bring any bug reports so far. Ouch...
