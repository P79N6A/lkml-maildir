Umm, what version of the kernel are you running?  If you are running a
recent version of 2.3.x, could we see the e820 output (at the head of
/var/log/dmesg)?

Linux is NOT designed to cope with bad RAM or overclocked CPU. If you can
swap RAM banks try to do this. It shurely looks like faulty RAM. Or faulty
motherboard (some Pentium motherboards can not sanely handle more then
64MiB RAM). One changed bit in kernel structure can sent kernel to hell.

Not without parsed kernel Oops I afraid. And even then if Oops are in
different places in different incarnations it's more like bad RAM then
anything else.
