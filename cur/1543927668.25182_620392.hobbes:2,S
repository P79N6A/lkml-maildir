Fantastic, thanks!  I've copied this to Debian bugs 433236 and 426124
which were about this problem.
BTW, the framebuffer penguin logo looked a little wierd (low number of
colours, odd colours), though on my powerpc it has always looked odd
(wrong colours).  Could there be some endianness bug in the fblogo
code?  I'll check it with other video options when I next have a few
minutes.
Thanks again,
Roger
