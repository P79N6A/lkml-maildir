I'm guessing rather it is an embedded setup, then a weird pata thing.
If we want to remove crud from this path we should provide a hook like
pm_power_off to handle the reboot case.
This is not the kind of thing that a reboot notifier can be used for.
as: 
a) reboot notifiers don't get called on all paths to machine_emergency_restart.
b) touching those bits looks like they immediately flip the reset line, so
   trigger the reboot immediately.
