Sorry for stepping in so late. io_remap_page_range() has an
architecture-specific calling convention. It can't be used in code
shared across where the calling conventions differ until that's
resolved (which I intend to do, though I'm not going to stop anyone
from doing it before I get around to it).
As drivers/char/mem.c is shared across all architectures, using
io_remap_page_range() there now is unsound and some other method to
accomplish whatever it does beyond remap_pfn_range() must be found
unless the io_remap_page_range() calling convention is resolved first.
