I have no argument that restricting it to v2 is potentially harmful,
but allowing distribution under GPL v3 is also potentially harmful
since the terms are not yet known, and later v3plus changes would
restrict the whole work to v3plus.
As for the "additional restriction" theory, the FSF apparently does
not think it is a restriction; the GPL says what happens *if* the
program says "or any later version."  If the intent were to always
allow newer license, that should be clearly written into the license
rather than making it conditional.  The GPL FAQ[1] implies that "or
any later version" is optional.  When the issue came up on
debian-legal earlier this year, Dave Turner provided an answer[2].
