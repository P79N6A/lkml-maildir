Could you provide at least remote way to find it?
I only found the same problem at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/27/3
but without any hits to solve the problem.
I will try CVS oprofile, if it works I will provide details of course.
My tree is based on rc1 and has this latest commit:
commit b5bf28cde894b3bb3bd25c13a7647020562f9ea0

There are no commits after that data with word 'oprofile' in
git-whatchanged at least.
