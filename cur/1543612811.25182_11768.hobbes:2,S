After a quick check it looks good.
One niggle, some strings for kuild 2.5 are longer than 30 characters,
cml2 restricts the string length in make menuconfig.  Only menuconfig
has this restriction, not oldconfig nor xconfig.  Can the limit be
removed, or at least changed to $ROWS-n which would adjust to screen
size?
