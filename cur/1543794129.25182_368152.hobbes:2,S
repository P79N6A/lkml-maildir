Good catch but wrong fix.  This code works fine on a 386.  Or
it did last time I tried it.
This dependency only exists if 3 level page tables are configured.
CONFIG_X86_PAE
The call to set_64bit is a specialized version of set_pmd.
Which also uses set_64_bit.  So I don't see how your kernel can
even build without this.
The only way I can see this even being selected is building
a kernel for a 386 or 486 and wanting pae support.  Which won't
work on a 386 or a 486.  Making it a pointless exercise.
So I think either the pgtable-3level.h needs to fixed,
or we just make CONFIG_HIGHME64G depend on CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG64.
