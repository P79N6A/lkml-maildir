It's a question of maintainability and simplicity also Greg.
I actually have no idea why you're making any sort of fuss about this.
To me it's so clear cut that we should do that.
Mutexes provide a much simpler locking technology.  The things that
semaphores can do that mutexes can't are rarely if ever used.
Therefore it's better to convert all of those cases only using the
simpler semantic set of mutexes from semaphores.
And we've been converting the entire tree this way for about 2 years,
I'm sorry that you've only just noticed that this is happening and
that there is general agreement that in general all such conversions
should be made.
