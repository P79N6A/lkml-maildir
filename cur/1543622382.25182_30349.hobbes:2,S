The spec doesn't make any statements about this, so the devices are allowed to 
do whatever seems best.  Although it is undoubtedly implemented as a fixed 
queue on a few devices, there are others whose queue depth depends on the 
available resources (most disk arrays function this way---they tend to juggle 
tag queue depth dynamically per lun).
Even if the queue depth is fixed, you have to probe it dynamically because it 
will be different for each device.  Even worse, on a SAN or other shared bus, 
you might not be the only initiator using the device queue, so even for a 
device with a fixed queue depth you don't own all the slots so the queue depth 
you see varies.
The bottom line is that you have to treat the queue full return as a normal 
part of I/O flow control to SCSI devices.
