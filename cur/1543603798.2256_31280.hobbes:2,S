O.k.  I'm getting more interested as I read this.  So we have things like
superio chips and the like with configureable resources, (and possibly some
pci<->isa bridge resources that need to bec onfigured.)
Coming from the linuxBIOS side I'm interested as that will allow me to
rip out more code, from linuxBIOS. And I think it is only sane to report
such devices.
I don't know about the stock BIOS interfaces to those devices though.  I'll
keep an eye on them and see what I can do.  Hopefully within the next couple
of mounths I can start attacking this problem.
