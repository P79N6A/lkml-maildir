While playing around with 2.6.0-test2 on my laptop, I tried to see if
APM support still worked on it. When I tried apm --suspend, the screen
would blank, but it would unblank as soon as I hit a key and I would
have the syslog messages "kernel: Suspending devices" and "kernel:
Devices Resumed." I found that if I ejected my card and made sure the
drivers were properly unloaded, apm --suspend once again suspended my
laptop. Under 2.4, the kernel would properly suspend while cards were
loaded, although I would sometimes have issues with waking the laptop
up if the state it was woken up in did not match the state it was put
to sleep in.
