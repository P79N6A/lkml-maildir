we could work on virtualizing the net interfaces in the host, map them to
eth0 or something in the guest and let the guest handle upper network layers ?
lo0 would just be exposed relying on skbuff tagging to discriminate traffic
between guests.
host                  |  guest 0  |  guest 1  |  guest2
----------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------

  |-> foo0   <--------+-----------+-----------+-> eth0
  |                   |           |           |
  `-> foo0:1  <-------+-----------+-> eth0    |
                      |           |           |
is that clear ? stupid ? reinventing the wheel ?
thanks,
