I didn't see any clean way to intersperse overwrites and appends to a
record-structured file without using vfs_llseek, which steps on f_pos.
 Actually, we may already have a problem with append races in
sys_write/sys_writev.  If it's possible for two threads to write() to
the same file in different threads (both intending to append), they
may wind up passing the same "pos" value into vfs_write().  Or does
fget_light/fput_light do some sort of locking that I'm not seeing?
Cheers,
