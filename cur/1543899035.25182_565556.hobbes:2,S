That's media error on sector 247236823 on WRITE.  Media errors on write
are bad signs - it usually means the drive even failed to remap the
sector because extra space ran out.  I'm not sure this is the case here
tho - the smart log is clear.  Please run smart short/long tests and see
what they say.
