Hi Linus,
Here's a relatively minor AVR32 update which fixes a few problems I
and some other people have run into when working on various drivers.
I'm sorry if this comes a bit late, but since none of this is very
critical, I've been sitting on the patches for a while to see if I
can gather up some more updates before sending it to you.
By the way, I've got access to an externally visible git repository
now, so the next update will probably be a git pull request if that's
ok with everyone.
