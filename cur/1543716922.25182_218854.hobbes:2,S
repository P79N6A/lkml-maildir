I think it is better to call sys_ioctl always from the wrappers and
only convert the arguments. This way you are guaranteed to not get
subtle differences in behaviour. This gives a clear layering. Otherwise 
driver writers have to do this ad-hoc and only chaos can evolve from
that.
In addition this is how all the current ioctl handlers work, no need
to be different.
