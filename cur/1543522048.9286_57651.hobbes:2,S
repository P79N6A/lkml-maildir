Yes, a well-known complaint.
Some time ago I sent a patch to someone with the same problem.
The comment
+       /* Look for partitions in two passes:
+          First find the primary partitions, and the DOS-type extended partitions.
+          On the second pass look inside *BSD and Unixware and Solaris partitions. */
shows what it does.
The patch was for 2.3.29 - will check that it still applies and post it here
later this evening. It also solves the problem people had where only one
BSD partition was detected.
