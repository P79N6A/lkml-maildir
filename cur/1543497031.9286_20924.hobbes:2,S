Recently I promised to produce man-pages-1.24 and util-linux-2.9s
this week. Unfortunately, a terrible disk crash caused a lot of
delay. So, only util-linux-2.9s today.
(At ftp.cwi.nl:/pub/aeb/util-linux and ftp.XX.kernel.org)
If your favourite patch is not in there it is possible
that it was lost (but more likely it is still in the queue).
I lost a small partition manipulation program,
but added addpart and delpart so that people on 2.3.3
can play with these ioctls.
Made in a hurry, without checking the details - do not use
on your production systems. In a week and a half I hope
to hear what was wrong.
