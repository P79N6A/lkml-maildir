I'm for its removal. As for the gcc project "losing its way" consider
that 3.4 has quite matured and also has much smaller binary size from
3.3. 4.0 however is still too early in its development to come close
to surpassing 3.4.
With all the changes and deprications it seems pointless to have to
maintain extra code so 3 people can use an obsolete compiler.
Something more recent like 3.4 should be used as a bench.
Just my two cents.
