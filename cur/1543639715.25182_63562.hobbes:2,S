That makes for 4 working reports to 2 non-working.  Apparently, these 2
people are having a true hardware issue, not merely a configuration
problem.
Can you tell me how old your modem is?  (i.e., about how long ago you
bought it?)  My theory is that actiontec made a new revision of the
modem that has sacrificed pure 16550 UART emulation in order to expose
more of the call-waiting feature to the computer.
Additionally, even my modem occasionally ceases to work, requiring a
reboot.  When this happens, dmesg contains the message "LSR safety check
failed."
Here's to getting this figured out!
