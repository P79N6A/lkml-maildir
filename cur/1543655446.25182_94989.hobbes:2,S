As a reminder of ancient times, one of the reasons I wanted to do
per-PCI-device interrupt routing was due to the older incarnation of
these chips, the Via 686 a/b southbridges.  They have a similar method
of routing interrupts, where writing to PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE directly
makes internal chip magic occur.  So you are correct WRT
"only work ... on the same chip as the irq controller"
