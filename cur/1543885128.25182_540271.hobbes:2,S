This is where you are very wrong.  Yes, it's rare in the Unix world
because non-trivial programs cannot implement this in most cases with
the available infrastructure.  But it is very common in other places
and what is more, it makes a lot of sense.  It gives you scalability
with the size of the machines at no cost associated to reorganizing
the program.

"basic", but not complete.  And I never said that the implementation
thye have is perfect, far from it.  The concept is good and if we now
can implement it, with all the event sources available, using an
efficient event delivery mechanism we are far ahead of their design.
The proposal now  on the table doesn't bring us there all the way and
it has the potential to make future work in the area of event delivery
harder just because there is more legacy code to be kept  happy.  This
is why I propose to not consider these changes and instead go for the
gold, i.e., the full solution.
