You hit all the fun bugs.
Just before we initialise cpufreqs notifier list..

The actual BUG you hit is 
        if (unlikely(lock_policy_rwsem_write(cpu)))
                BUG();
It _looks_ like we're leaking a refcount on that lock, but
I don't see where.  It's a shame you can't reproduce this easily,
as cpufreq.debug=7 would give us more clues.
(And CONFIG_CPUFREQ_DEBUG=y)
I'll think about this some more.
