My argument was about being able to browse the amount of data I was
refering to. The hearbeat thing was an asside to Roman as to the
fact that we already do what he's suggesting.

I've already clarified your mischaracterization of custom events,
you are being dissengenious here. If you want a generalized hooking
mechanism, feel free to ask Andrew to take kernel hooks:

Again, damned if we do, damned if don't. LTT isn't meant for kernel
debugging per se, though you can use it to that end to a certain extent.
However, if you are kernel debugging, you will find the ad-hoc mode I'm
talking about adding to relayfs quite useful.

Oh, now you want to lighten the weight on postprocessing? Common Thomas,
please stop wasting my time.
Note, however, that we are thinking of dropping the lockless scheme
for now. We will pick up this discussion separately further down the
road.

It is. Have you even read what I suggested to change in my other mail:
if ((any_filtering) && !(ltt_filter(event_id, event_struct, data)))
	return -EINVAL;
You're not honestly telling me that checking for any_filtering is
going to ruin your day.

Actually, on a PII-350MHz, I was already generating 0.5MB/s of data
just by running an X session. If we assume that a machine 10 times
faster generates 10 times as many events, we've already got 5MB/s,
and I'm sure that there are heavier cases than X.
Here's the paper if you want to read it:

Like I said above, fighting for/against lockless is not our immediate
goal, and we will likely remove it.

Not even Ingo hinted at getting rid of filtering. Remember the earlier
e-mail I refered to? Here's what he was suggesting:

Notice the "event_wanted()"?

Again, Thomas, I don't mind hearing you out, but please don't waste
my time.

Like I said, we are willing to accomodate those who want to be able
to use relayfs for kernel debugging purposes, but we can hardly
be blamed for not making LTT a generic kernel debugging tool as this
is exactly the excuse many kernel developers had for not including
LTT to start with. It's just totally dissengenious for giving us
grief for claiming that we are doing something and then later turn
around and blame us for not doing it ... cheesh ...
