Oh, I recognize the code is _ancient_, almost two years old.  But the
point of my post with those excessively long quotes from Intel is that
on the P6 , Intel doesn't guarantee LOCK for write-back cached addresses!

I was somewhat surprised that both CPU's oops'd simultaneously at the
same EIP.

the address is aligned [so it won't cross cache lines].  I've observed
gcc being very poor at alignment, inserting .align 2 when .align 4 would
have been better.  And gas using the last given .align when there are
multiples.  So movb is a good idea.  Or is there something else?

Is this related to the documented 82443BX erratum of hanging on 
reboot when DRAM refresh is in progress?
