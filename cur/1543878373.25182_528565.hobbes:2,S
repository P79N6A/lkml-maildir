As far as the memory usage is concerned, I can. :-)  Usually, it takes 1 extent
(40 B on x86_64) to register all of the allocated swap pages.  If bitmaps are
used, we need as many bits as there are swap pages available (for 1 GB swap
and 4 KB pages that would be ~250000 bits, which gives ~8 pages, and we can
save more than 800 extents using that much memory).

Yes, I think so, but still we can ask Andrew to include it into -mm earlier? ;-)
