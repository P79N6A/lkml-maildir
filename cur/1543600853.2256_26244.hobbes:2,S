My system crashes with an oops (haven't written it down yet).  I found
that if I compile the trident sound as a module it doesn't crash.  This
is true even after insert.  If I don't compile it as a module it oopses
on boot right before it would bring up the Networking things (after the
few lines of output are given for sound).
I just wanted to provide a heads up.  I will be trying to capture the
oops soon and sending it on.
It works fine in 2.4.8.
