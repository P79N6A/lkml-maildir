Patches are often saved and applied later. In this case it is useful to have
the context of the mail message it was contained in around in the same 
file, so that you later actually know what you apply if you happen to 
not memorize it completely. Patch will ignore the mail part so it can be 
still applied directly.
With saved attachments you usually just a patch and no description, or 
it requires extra effort to save the description too.
