as for distros: RHL8 and later ship with it on the RH side
(default enabled as of RHL9).
As for where to start it: I really think an initscript is the logical
place; there has been some discussion about doing it
from the initramfs but I don't see real benifit from that; from starting
init to running the initscripts isn't exactly THIS interrupt/performance
heavy.
