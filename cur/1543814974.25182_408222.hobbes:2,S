It would have been much better if you'd avoided the temptation to make
sweeping cleanups.  We're trying to get a product out here and there are
good reasons for preferring minimal fixes at this stage.
The non-MIPS changes eyeball out OK.  The MIPS changes are quite unobvious.
A patch which applies cleanups like that would have been rejected out of
hand as a post-2.6.16-rc6 candidate, so why on earth go mixing it up with
important bugfixes?
Sigh.

Why clamp it at INT_MAX/2?   INT_MAX is positive.
