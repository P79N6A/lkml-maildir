Ok, I've been following up on this failure on elm3b132/3.  I moved
forward to v2.6.22-rc2-mm1 and that also fails.  I ran a bisection on
the git-newsetup patch in as in -mm and basically it came down to the
first patch, ie. any and all of this tree stops the boot.
I just tried reproducing git-newsetup boot failures with the latest
version of your tree (369f16fdd423d79640c4390915e6ab71189cb497) and that
also fails.
Fails in this context is hard boot failure after loading the kernel and
before anything is printed.  I also added a printf to the top of main()
in boot/main.c and it doesn't come out, not that I really know if that
means it got there or not.
Any suggestions how to debug this puppy?
