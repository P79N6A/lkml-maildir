I confirm gcc version:
~/src/linux-2.6.23-rc3$ gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-slackware-linux/3.2.3/specs
Configured with: ../gcc-3.2.3/configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared
 --enable-threads=posix --enable-__cxa_atexit --disable-checkingi
 --with-gnu-ld --verbose --target=i486-slackware-linux
 --host=i486-slackware-linux
Thread model: posix
gcc version 3.2.3
glibc-2.3.2
Sorry, you have to guess this, but, after reporting long time ago some
acpi make warnings, I didn't even suspect anybody would be interested
more this time...
It's an old box with Slackware 9.1, and this make is the last stage
of testing such a hot kernel version... But, according to README gcc
3.2 seems to be legal. (I hope there would be some warning about gcc
too old, anyway.)
Cheers,
