Your config still has CONFIG_X86_TSC set, hence the panic.
Do a 'make oldconfig' after switching CPU type from a
TSC-capable one to a TSC-less one in 2.4 kernels. There
is a known bug in the old configuration system where it
can leave derived options in an inconsistent state after
a single round of option changes. CONFIG_X86_TSC is the
prime example of this. Doing a second configuration round
allows the derived options to reach a fixpoint.
