I agree that this would be a useful enhancement to the uhci_hcd driver. 
For example:
           CPU0
  0:  183247514          XT-PIC  timer  0/47514
  1:      67096          XT-PIC  i8042  58/67096
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade  0/0
  8:   82425669          XT-PIC  rtc  0/25669
 10:  163607273          XT-PIC  uhci_hcd, EMU10K1  0/7273
 11:    1912890          XT-PIC  uhci_hcd, eth0  0/12890
 12:          0          XT-PIC  uhci_hcd  0/0
 15:     244330          XT-PIC  ide1  0/44329
The front panel USB port shares an interrupt with the sound card, the
rear with eth0.  Fome some of my testing it would be helpful if these
just had numbers that I could mentally associate with a USB port.  Right
now I have to move the mouse and watch the interrupt count.

Agreed, this bug should be fixed either way.
