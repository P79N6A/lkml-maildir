Use my S3 fb driver when it comes out.  :)  Initially it will be a
merge of the existing S3triofb and cyberfb drivers, supporting NewMMIO
cards (Trio64V and later), but the next step after that is to support
mmio_968 cards (Trio32/64 and some earlier cards), which are somewhat
similar.
If anybody knows a cheap source of S3 cards, let me know.  The older
cards are tough to find, and I would like some for testing.
