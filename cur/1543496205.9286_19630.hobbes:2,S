Hello folks! How are you today?
Well, I've been having some difficulty on compiling kernel 2.2.x. I read
the Changes file, and I'm sure I upgraded everything in need. Still I get
this error message that's pissing me off:
------
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.9/arch/i386/lib'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.9/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2
 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=586   -c -o checksum.o checksum.c
checksum.c:200: redefinition of `csum_partial_copy'
checksum.c:105: `csum_partial_copy' previously defined here
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:185: Fatal error: Symbol csum_partial_copy already defined.
make[2]: *** [checksum.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
------
I hope any of you get a solution, I really don't know what to do...
Oh, please reply to my e-mail address: marcelo@pegasus.com.br
Thanks in advance,
 Marcelo Borges
