I think we're agreeing here.
The current kmalloc_percpu() is a wrapper around kmalloc.  That seems OK to
me.
What we _do_ want to solve is the problem that DEFINE_PERCPU() does not work
in modules.  Rusty's patch (reworked to not alter kmalloc_percpu) would suit
that requirement.
(kiran has a new version of kmalloc_percpu() which may be faster than the
current one, but for the purposes of this discussion it's equivalent).
