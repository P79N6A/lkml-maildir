My interest is in having journalled processes at the system call level
so you can do full forward error recovery and resume on another node.
But in this day and age of webby stuff it's often not necessary for
the enterprise and a lot of hassle for everyone else (especially
preserving and handling network state). In any case, at OLS, I asked
the Xen folks about this and was told some people are apparently
looking into somehow "transactionalising" Xen so you'll be able to
checkpoint as you go and handle failover.

I think that for very specific applications it would be possible,
others would make it much harder and necessary to have userland
support (even if not in the application itself). It's something I'd
recommend as a research topic due to it's open ended nature but I'm
not so sure we'll see this in Linux any time soon :-)
