Hello again!
scsi:
   why is 3ware ide controller still listed under the SCSI section?
   other ide raids are under the ide menu, too.
   should fusion mpt not be moved to the scsi section, too?
   (as far as I understood mpt it looks like that...)
net:
   what about a new point 'virtual network devices' for tun/tap/bonding/eql ?
   why are Xircom CardBus not under removeable/pcmcia devices?
Nico
