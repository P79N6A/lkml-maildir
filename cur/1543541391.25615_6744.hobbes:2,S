Subject: 2.4.0-test6: PCI probe/config problem?

2.4.0-test5 works fine, but here's what I get when I try 2.4.0-test6 on
a Dell Latitude CPx:
(...)
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfc0ce, last bus=1
PCI: Using configuration type 1
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Using IRQ router default [8086/1234] at 00:07.0
PCI: Error while updating region 00:03.0/1 (10000000 != 220000a0)
PCI: Error while updating region 00:03.1/1 (10001000 != 020000a0)
(...)
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.20
  kernel build: 2.4.0-test6 #1 Thu Aug 10 17:32:03 CDT 2000
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [apm]
Intel PCIC probe:
  Bridge register mapping failed: check cb_mem_base setting
not found.
ds: no socket drivers loaded!
The "PCI:" lines are identical for a 2.4.0-test5 boot except that
the "Error" lines don't show up: the CardBus bridge is at the
expected 0x10000000 and 0x10001000 addresses.
Any idea what's going on here?
