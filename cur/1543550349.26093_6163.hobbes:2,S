NFS and FXSAVE.  Ouch.  Well, let's set the stage for the future:
I'm doing kernel coordination for VA now.  And I'm very careful not to
break things.  I may make mistakes -- heck, I *will* make mistakes;
it's a big kernel, after all -- but I won't be negligent.  I care
greatly about stability ... just ask anyone who was around for the
upgrade from Perl 5.3 to 5.4.
BTW, VA's current kernel-in-testing has Trond's (now your! :-)) NFS,
rock-solid NFSD from Neil Brown and Dave Higgen, and FXSAVE support
back-ported from 2.4.  I hope to get much of VA's kernel-in-testing
patch set into mainline 2.2 ... keeping up with N/2 patches is 4x
easier than N.  (Or at least it seems so.)
