We want to install PCs over ethernet with PXE. For the first boot from 
net we have nothing than the network, we don't know the hardware, so an 
UNDI in the kernel would be perfect. IMHO

Does it matter in our case?

We need it not to run an operating system, we need it for the 
installation of an operating system.
On the other hand, UNDI will deliver a network driver for all PXE-cards 
that come up before there is any direct hardware support. (Ok, then b 
matters)
