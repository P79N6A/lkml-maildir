OK I didn't realise it is a test from ltp.
But I can't reproduce it for the life of me with the latest git kernel
and latest ltp tarball.
Is it easy to reproduce? Are you reproducing it simply by running the
ftest03 binary directly from the shell? How many times between oopses?
It is multi-process but no threads, so races should be minimal down
this path -- can you get an strace of the failing process?
Thanks,
