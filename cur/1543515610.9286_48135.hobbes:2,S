Not quite.  The thing *as a whole* is GPL-licensed, but its compenents
may be extracted under their original license terms.

"may not be integrated with non-GPL software" appears, to me, to refer
to software that is non-GPL *prior* to integration.
Your point about integrated software becoming GPLed as a whole refers to
*after* integration.
Therefore, the clause "may not be integrated with non-GPL software" is
an additional restriction beyond the GPL, which is not permitted by a
clause in the GPL, so the overall license is not GPL and is
self-contradictory.
Also "integrated" means different things to different people, including
lawyers.  These different things have different consequences according
to the GPL's terms.
