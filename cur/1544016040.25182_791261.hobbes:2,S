Subject: [PATCHSET linux-2.6-x86:tip] x86: make percpu offsets zero-based on SMP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
This patchset is re-hash of Mike Travis' original work on zero-based
percpu offsets.  I couldn't get the original patches working (where is
the linker script changes other than the PHDR addition?) and ended up
doing a quite similar series of patches.  A lot of this patch series
was copied verbatim from or got a lot of hints from Mike Travis'
original patches.  Some differences are...
* better splitted - one thing at a time.
* how the pda is allocated at the head.  this patch uses preallocation
  directly from linker script as it's something arch specific anyway.
* pda ops are wrappers around x86 percpu ops.
* x86-32 SMP is also converted to zero-based offsets, so we should be
  able to do cpualloc (or whatever) for both subarchs.
This patchset contains the following thirteen patches.
  0001-x86_64-fix-pda_to_op.patch
  0002-x86-make-early_per_cpu-a-lvalue-and-use-it.patch
  0003-x86_64-Cleanup-early-setup_percpu-references.patch
  0004-x86_32-make-vmlinux_32.lds.S-use-PERCPU-macro.patch
  0005-x86_64-make-percpu-symbols-zerobased-on-SMP.patch
  0006-x86_64-load-pointer-to-pda-into-gs-while-brining-u.patch
  0007-x86_64-use-static-_cpu_pda-array.patch
  0008-x86_64-fold-pda-into-percpu-area-on-SMP.patch
  0009-x86_64-merge-64-and-32-SMP-percpu-handling.patch
  0010-x86_64-make-pda-a-percpu-variable.patch
  0011-x86_64-convert-pda-ops-to-wrappers-around-x86-percp.patch
  0012-x86_64-misc-clean-up-after-the-percpu-update.patch
  0013-x86_32-make-percpu-symbols-zerobased-on-SMP.patch
0001-0004 prepares for coming changes.  0005 converts x86_64 SMP
percpu to zero based offset.  0006-0007 preps for percpu/pda
simplification.  0008-0012 unifies percpu and pda handling
step-by-step.  0013 converts x86_32 SMP percpu to zer based offset.
Each step was tested with gcc-4.1.3, 4.2.3 and 4.3.1 on x86_64, 4.3.1
on i386 for both SMP and UP configurations.  The final state is
currently being tested using 4.2.3 on both x86_64 and 32.
This patchset is on top of the current linux-2.6-x86:tip[1] and also
available in the following git tree.
