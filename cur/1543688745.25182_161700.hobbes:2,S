I'm working on a new driver for 2.6 that include my 2.4 updates, a
slightly reworked version of Kronos and Jon i2c DDC code and some
more source cleanup (split the driver in separate files actually).
It's not finished yet though. I'm not yet sure I'll add support for
dual head in the first version neither, all of this pretty much depends
on how much time I'll be able to dedicate to it during the upcoming
week.
Ben.
