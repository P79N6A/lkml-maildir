hm, then why does causal.c trigger a causality violation on a 8-way box?
Interestingly it's getting triggered if there are two copies (4 threads
total) running. [which could be simply just randomness added to the system
bus load and thus statistically finds the window]
the basic causality test is what was analyzed yesterday:
           CPU0                           CPU1
        for (;;) {                     for (;;) {
               i++;                            a = j;
               j++;                            b = i;
        }                                       if (a < b)
                                                        BUG()
                                       }
i've extended this to do the same thing in a 'symmetric' way, still two
threads on two CPUs, but now both are doing loads and stores and the above
causality test:
         CPU0                            CPU1
        for (;;) {                     for (;;) {
               i1++;                            i2++;
               j1++;                            j2++;
               a = j2;                          a = j1;
               b = i2;                          b = i1;
               if (a < b)                       if (a < b)
                       BUG();                           BUG();
        }                              }
(i've attached the code again. i1, j1, i2, j2 are shared global, a, b are
private local variables.)
note that this cannot be reproduced on Andrea's dual-PII box (neither on
my dual-PIII box), but can be reproduced on my 8-way Xeon box, if two
copies of the above are running. [maybe if i added delay timings to the
above then we could trigger it on dual boxes too] 'two copies' means two
independent pairs of the above.
the code is simple and obvious enough extension of the most trivial
causality test, but it doesnt work.
