Not sure. Maybe its partly due to the host bridge having all the
smarts to deal with the memory controller.

Why exactly are you trying to write host bridge drivers anyway ?
Confused.
If there's a sensible reason for such drivers, we could at some
stage have the bridge drivers check for AGP capabilities, and
if found, start up the initialisation of the relevant AGP chipset
driver. (and then rip out the whole PCI detection stuff in agpgart).
This is quite a lot of work though, so unless there's a really
compelling reason, I don't think its worth doing.
Another way forward (somewhat hacky in one sense, but a lot cleaner in another)
would be to change the PCI code so that it'll load and init
multiple drivers that claim to support the same PCI ID.
This may cause issues for some other drivers however where
we have an old and a new driver with ID overlap.
So,.. what are you up to?
