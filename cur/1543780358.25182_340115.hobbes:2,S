Subject: [PATCH - RFC] Move initramfs configuration to "General setup"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/8/92

At present the configuration items for initramfs is located in:
Device drivers | Block Drivers | xxx
This is maybe not the most natural place to have it.
So with the following patch it is moved below "General setup",
and relevant config items are collected in a file with a new
home in usr/.
The original reason why I looked into this is the upcoming merge of klibc
and I missed a good place to include the KLIBC relevant config options.
With the Kconfig file added to usr/ is will be a simple menuconfig
in here for all the KLIBC relevant config options.
Any comments?
