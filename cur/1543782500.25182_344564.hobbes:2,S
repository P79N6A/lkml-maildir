Hi Venki,
   I'm confused by the calculation of the drift value in the hpet
driver.  The specs defines the recommended minimum hardware
implementation is a frequency drift of 0.05% or 500ppm.  However, the
drift passed in when registering with the time interpolator is:
ti->drift = ti->frequency * HPET_DRIFT / 1000000;
Isn't that absolute number of ticks per second drift?  The time
interpolator defines the drift in parts per million.  Shouldn't this
simply be:
ti->drift = HPET_DRIFT;
The current code seems to greatly penalize any hpet timer with greater
than a 1MHz frequency.  Thanks,
	Alex
