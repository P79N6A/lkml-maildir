No - look to see if the __cast__ is there, the (cpumask_t) term
that was needed in the define of CPU_MASK_NONE:
#define CPU_MASK_NONE                                                   \
((cpumask_t){ {                                                         \
        [0 ... BITS_TO_LONGS(NR_CPUS)-1] =  0UL                         \
} })
This would be on the preprocessor code that is generated from line
1137 of drivers/perfctr/x86.c, where the error is generated.   This is
the source line that looks like:
	old_mask = perfctr_cpus_forbidden_mask;
The preprocessor output from this line in the x86.i file will look
something like this, hopefully:
   Good:
	old_mask = ((cpumask_t){ { [0 ... (((8)+32 -1)/32)-1] = 0UL } });
Not like this:
   Bad:
	old_mask = { { [0 ... (((8)+32 -1)/32)-1] = 0UL } };
(the '8' varies with your NR_CPUS configuration).
