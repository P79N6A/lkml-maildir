Hello,
There's a weird behavior we are experiencing with the Marvell
6081 controller, which I though you might have also experienced
or might find interesting.
Basically, the problem involves sporadic device disconnection 
during driver load time and sometimes during continuous use. It
was seen both with sata_mv and the driver provided by Marvell 
(version 3.6.1), so I have a reason to believe it's an hardware 
problem (to which we can find good software-based workarounds, 
hopefully).
The system seen below has 2 Marvell 6081 controllers harboring
a total of 14 hard-drives.
Once in every a few hundreds-or-so insmods of sata_mv the 
controller "misses" one of the drives, as seen below:

Rest assured that drive is there, we haven't pulled it out. 
On Linux 2.4.27 with the Marvell driver (3.6.1), using the 
add-single-device command on the (now depricated) /proc/scsi/scsi 
interface, we managed to bring the drive back to life...
The drives are the 500GB from Maxtor. This problem has occured 
with drives from a different manufacturer.
