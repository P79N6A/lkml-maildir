I kind of figured.  I just wanted it to be clear why I have
a problem with the semantics of the current VPID implementation.
Especially as the tone of the post from the last day or two
was:  Can't we satisfy everyone?
The picture you drew is all that is required for my implementation
and it doesn't run into problems because you only need one PID in
your parent pspace.
