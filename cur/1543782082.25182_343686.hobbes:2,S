Hmm, true. release_task() is not called in this case, so p->sighand is
still there.
But we can not check for p->sighand == NULL, as sighand is released
after exit_itimers() so we are still deadlock prone. So I think
__exit_sighand() should be called before exit_itimers(). Then we can do 
retry:
	if (unlikely(!p->sighand))
		return -1;
instead of checking for PF_EXITING.
