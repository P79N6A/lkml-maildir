Since you're willing to use CMPXCHG in your suggested implementation, would it
make it make life easier if you were willing to use XADD too?
Plus, are you really willing to limit the number of readers or writers to be
32767? If so, I think I can suggest a way that limits it to ~65535 apiece
instead...
