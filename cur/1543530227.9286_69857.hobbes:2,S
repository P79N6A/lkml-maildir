"Get rid of OOM". Wonderful! Now, if you'll just send us a copy of your
patch which gives the kernel infinite memory...
You CANNOT "get rid of" running out of memory. You have a finite amount of
memory, with various processes all taking chunks of it - once it's all
gone, you are OOM. Now, how do you "get rid of" the problem? The clone()
syscall doesn't work on DRAM...
