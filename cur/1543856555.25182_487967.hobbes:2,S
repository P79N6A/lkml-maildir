I'd be surprised if the choice of hash algorithm itself makes much difference.
But we can't say much about it unless we can see the code (ie: your code).
Is it a simple old hash-to-find-the-bucket-then-walk-a-list implementation?
If so, what does the bucket count distribution look like?  What is the average
walk length?  Does it use a single lock, or hashed locking, or a lock-per-bucket?
etc.
