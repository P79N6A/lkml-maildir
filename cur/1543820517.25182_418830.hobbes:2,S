Umm.. Stephen? Where in Fedora Core is it?  I'm running a Fedora Core Rawhide
right now, and it's not on my system, and 'yum provides pam_namespace.so'
doesn't find it either.  There *is* stuff over in the -lspp branch, but it
(AFAIK) hasn't escaped into anything resembling general availability.  Was this
what you were referencing?
