I wrote out the contents of /dev/rd/0 a few times and diff'ed with the
uncompressed image of the initrd on the server. No difference each time. The
same after digging into swap, turning off swap, running blockdev --flushbufs
several times (always with BLKFLSBUF: Device or resource busy).
The next test will be to create an initrd that has the 'initrd' directory..
(this is all with 2.4.4-ac13 +crypto-2.4.3.1 +alsa-cvs)
