Or smart hardware with kernel intervention at some earlier point in
time to set the demultiplexing up securely.  We've got a NIC that does
this, and you can basically drive CPU utilization to zero while 
saturating your PCI bus if you do it right.
This issue of user-space networking strikes me as a red herring, though -
I don't see any reason why user-level networking creates any greater need
for lightweight processes than anything else.
