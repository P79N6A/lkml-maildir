Subject: 2.4.6-pre6 cs46xx build error with CONFIG_SOUND_FUSION=m

With CONFIG_SOUND_FUSION=m, I get the following error for 2.4.6-pre6 during
make modules:
cs46xx.c:386: conflicting types for `cs46xx_suspend_tbl'
cs46xxpm-24.h:39: previous declaration of `cs46xx_suspend_tbl'
cs46xx.c:387: conflicting types for `cs46xx_resume_tbl'
cs46xxpm-24.h:40: previous declaration of `cs46xx_resume_tbl'
cs46xx.c:5617: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
cs46xx.c:5618: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
cs46xx.c:5693: conflicting types for `cs46xx_suspend_tbl'
cs46xx.c:386: previous declaration of `cs46xx_suspend_tbl'
cs46xx.c:5702: conflicting types for `cs46xx_resume_tbl'
cs46xx.c:387: previous declaration of `cs46xx_resume_tbl'
make[2]: *** [cs46xx.o] Error 1
With CONFIG_SOUND_FUSION=y, 2.4.6-pre6 builds without errors,
but the sound doesn't work while running 2.4.6-pre6.  The sound does
work with 2.4.3-20mdksmp as shipped with LM 8.0.  
I've got a number of older 2.4.[3,4,5] kernels, so I'll go back and try to 
figure out when the change occured, but this is the first time I've seen 
this particular build error.
