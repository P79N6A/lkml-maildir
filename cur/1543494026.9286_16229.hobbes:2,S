I've had these sitting around for a few days, and they are very easy to
reproduce (this was with 2.2.6):
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp       48      0 bhalpha1.nibh.go.:shell bhmarvin.nibh.go.j:1023 CLOSE       
tcp       45      0 bhalpha1.nibh.go.:shell bhmarvin.nibh.go.j:1021 CLOSE_WAIT  
tcp       47      0 bhalpha1.nibh.go.:shell bhmarvin.nibh.go.j:1022 CLOSE       
tcp       46      0 bhalpha1.nibh.go.:shell bhmarvin.nibh.go.j:1022 CLOSE       
tcp       46      0 bhalpha1.nibh.go.:shell bhmarvin.nibh.go.j:1022 CLOSE       
tcp       44      0 bhalpha1.nibh.go.:shell bhmarvin.nibh.go.j:1023 CLOSE       
I just did a mess of "rcp" from marvin (which is on the same network
segment as the alpha) pulling stuff and inetd on the alpha eventually
killed it with
inetd[223]: shell/tcp server failing (looping), service terminated 
kill -HUP <inetd> was required to get it going again, and the tcp socket
remained with stuff in the recv-q.
which (Alan pointed out to me) can be fixed with this:
shell   stream  tcp     nowait.120 root /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.rshd
                              ^^^^
(the default is 40 per second) but the point is it's easy to generate.
I'll have a look at that patch...
