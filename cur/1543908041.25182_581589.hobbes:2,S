This is not working...
ACPI can and does access all kind of other I/O ports and other
resources.
Hmm, are the disk accesses done by ACPI via OperationRegion/Field
declared variables?
I try to get a check for those clashing with native drivers (hopefully
this approach is successful for 2.6.24, can't say for sure yet), I
wonder whether this one would give a warning like "Libata driver is
using the same SystemIO/SystemMem resources than ACPI OperationRegion
declaration XY".
This would not solve the problem, but at least show the need of such a
test. Such ACPI vs native driver interference problems are very hard
nuts (in identifying and solving).
Can someone post an ASL code snippet how ACPI actually access the disk
and in which parts/functions, pls.
Thanks,
   Thomas
