Actually, that's the version installed by RedHat 6.0.  heh... I hadn't
even realized (or thought to check) if it was a prerelease.  Output of gcc
-v is:
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
So, either egcs 1.1.2 was released 0314 or RH is fudging a little. 
Oh, and to stay on topic, the posted patch worked for me here also.
