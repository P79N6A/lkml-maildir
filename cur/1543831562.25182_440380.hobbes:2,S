Brice,
The above comment and the main part of this patch don't look right to me.
Maybe it's the glass of wine I had two hours ago and it's around midnight
now...
If the "root chipset" is not a PCI device and the architecture doesn't
fake it, the root chipset (aka "PCI Host bus controller") is not visible
to PCI subsystem. Some of the arch code (e.g. drivers/parisc/dino.c)
uses "bus->self == NULL" to differentiate between PCI-PCI secondary busses
and PCI bus below a "root chipset". ISTR alpha and sparc doing the same.
Can you confirm I'm remembering/understanding this bit correctly?

I don't see how this could work for alpha/parisc/sparc (IIRC) or any other
architecture that doesn't create "fake" PCI Root busses.
I think your previous patch was correct in this regard.

In particular, I'm thinking this loop isn't correct though I'm not
in a particular, erm, "certain" frame of mind right now.
Under a parisc root device, pdev->bus->self would be NULL.
Maybe that's why parisc uses pci_scan_bus_parented()
instead of pci_scan_bus(). (I've forgot the background
behind that change).
thanks,
