Odd.  It works fine for me (I've had this sort of configuration on
some machines for ages, and I just tested a bleeding edge kernel and
it still works).
So I suspect there is something else going on that has nothing to do
with the usage of partitioned md.... then again, maybe there is some
weird sign extension happening to '254' somewhere, though that would
be terribly strange.
So: details please.
 What md device exactly (major and minor)
 What filesystem.
 'tcpdump -s0' trace capturing all nfs/mountd/rpc packets from before
 you issue the mount command. e.g.  use 'rpcinfo -p' to find out what
 port mountd is listening on then,
   tcpdump -s0 -w /tmp/trace host CLIENT and host SERVER and \( \
    port 2049 or port 111 or port MOUNTDPORT \)  &
 Then try the mount.
 After the experiment, on the server
    grep . /proc/net/rpc/*/content
    cat /proc/fs/nfsd/exports
That should be enough detail to start with.
