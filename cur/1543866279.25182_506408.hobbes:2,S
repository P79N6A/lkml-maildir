What would be the advantage of that? 
The reason we present nodes to user space is that we can tell the user
where the memory is. You seem to try to promote it to some abstract entity
beyond that, but that doesn't seem particularly fruitful to me. I think
I prefer "down to earth" memory nodes.

Well it is then most local to that node's memory.

The main problem I used to have was regressions. e.g. having memory
less nodes in different combinations would break in new releases.
(on x86-64 this depends on how the DIMMs are distributed so sometimes
breakage wasn't noticed for a long time. We ended up trying all combinations
on a simulator in the end). Assigning to nearby nodes avoided that special
case.
Ok there is still one other case -- nodes that have memory, but not enough
to do anything useful. This can happen too, but is still somewhat different.
Basically all kmalloc_node() need to fail gratiously.
