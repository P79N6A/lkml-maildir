This is a special case.  Usually, the use of volatile is just lazy.  In 
this case, it's probably necessary on at least some architectures, so we 
can't remove it everywhere unless we want to rewrite atomic.h completely 
in inline assembler for several architectures, and painstakingly verify 
all that work.  I would hope it's obvious that having consistent 
behavior on all architectures, or even at all compiler optimization 
levels within an architecture, can be agreed to be good.  Additionally, 
atomic_t variables are a rare exception, in that we pretty much always 
want to work with the latest value in RAM on every access.  Making this 
atomic will allow us to remove a bunch of barriers which do nothing but 
slow things down on most architectures.
I agree that the use of atomic_t in .c files is generally bad, but in 
certain special cases, hiding it inside defined data types may be worth 
the slight impurity, just as we sometimes tolerate lines longer than 80 
columns when "fixing" it makes things unreadable.
