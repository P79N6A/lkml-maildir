Well, as to what should be the default for this, enabling or not
enabling memory spreading on these inode and similar such slab caches,
I will have to leave that up to others more expert than I.
I am content to suggest that the default should reflect either the
current default (no spreading, as such was not an option until now) or
what is best for the majority of systems (whatever that is).
Probably best not to change the default, unless there is a clear
concensus that it's wrong in the majority of cases.
Whatever systems don't like the default can change it easily enough,
one way or the other.
