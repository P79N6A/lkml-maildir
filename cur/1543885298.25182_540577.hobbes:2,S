It turns out the system is no go with 4 GB of RAM (4 * 1 GB modules): system
instability & SATA controller doesn't detect the drives (as I reported to
linux-ide:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-ide@vger.kernel.org/msg06174.html
).
With only 2 GB of RAM (with either pairs), system is very stable (surviving
many parallel kernel compiles for over 3 times longer than that of 4 GB), and
it detects & works fine with the SATA drives also.
Any advice on getting all of 4 GB to work reliably with SATA also?
Thanks
PS: Here's a dmesg of the all stably working 2 GB system, & the oopsy one with
4 GB.
