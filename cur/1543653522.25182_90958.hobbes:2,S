Subject: [patch] remove magic numbers in block queue initialization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
Your less-requests patch signaled a way-too-many magic numbers alarm
(not the patches fault, of course, but it pointed it out).
Attached patch removes the minimum queue length, maximum queue length,
factor of queue length that is number of batch requests, and the maximum
number of batch request magic numbers and replaces them with defines and
some comments.
Look OK?
	Robert Love
Replace magic numbers in block queue init with sexy defines.
