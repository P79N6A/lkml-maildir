Unless the new windowing system is 100% backwards compatible with X11, then yes.

And when the windowing system crashes it'll take the kernel down with it - ouch.
And if I want to run a headless server without a graphical display I
can't simply stop the windowing system I'd have to rebuild a kernel
without the windowing system in it - yuck.
What we have now is a nicely decoupled system - it would be even
better if X was even more decoupled from the kernel, but lets not put
the windowing system in kernel space.
X is not perfect, but it has been around long enough that it has a
huge base of software using it. Throwing that out the window would be
silly.
X also has had networking support since the beginning, and all X apps
can run with remote displays without having to do much (if anything)
themselves to support that - that's a really nice feature.
Modern X can be quite fast with a properly supported graphics card,
and stuff like Xgl has just improved things even more recently.
X has good multihead support - another nice feature.
Graphics drivers for X run (usually/mostly) in userspace - nice, then
they don't destabilize the kernel.
And there's lots of other features as well.
Do you really want to put all that complexity into the kernel?
