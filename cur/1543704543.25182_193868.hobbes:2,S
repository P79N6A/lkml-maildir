A boolean is just a one-bit reference count. If the maximum number of
simultaneous 'users' for a given module is one, then a boolean will work.
If there is potential for more than one simultaneous user then you need
more bits.
Either way, it doesn't simplify the problem.

And how will the module know when it is or is not "in use"? By keeping
a count of the number of current users, of course.

I don't follow your logic. Once it works we don't have to test it so 
therefore we never need to test it? I don't buy the premise or the
conclusion.

This moon's not worth barking at.

Linus can of course speak for himself but from my perspective it's just
a simple cost/benefit analysis. This one's just not worth any more toil.
Several extremely bright people have tackled the problem and eventually
concluded it's extremely hard to solve and generally not worth the
trouble. It's time to let go.
