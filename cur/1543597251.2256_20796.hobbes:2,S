Yet another case of Linux pro-active bug-fixing.  I have already sent
a patch for this to Linus and Alan.  It seems I CC'd ext2-devel, but
not linux-kernel.
Here is the patch again.  It was likely caused by Al Viro's major
overhaul of the ext2 directory code, to move it into the page cache.
Cheers, Andreas
