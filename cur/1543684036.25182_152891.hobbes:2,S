well there is add_timer_on()...
I still don't see the race in the itimer code actually.  On return
from del_timer_sync() we know that the timer is not pending, even
if it_real_fn() tried to re-add it.
ie: why does the below "crash"?

(Does the timer_pending() test in del_timer_sync() needs some
barriers btw?)
