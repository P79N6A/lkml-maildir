That's what I meant with the coffee break. In a big installation
somebody is always drinking coffee :-)
You also have often different loads during daytime and
nighttime. Swapping buffers out to swap disk instead of rereading from
the database makes a lot of sense for this. But a single job should
never swap. (It works for two month and then next month you get the
big escalation and you would love to have hotplug memory)
So swapping happens in productive use. But nobody should rely on
that too much. 
And I completely agree that uncooperative OOM is not acceptable.
