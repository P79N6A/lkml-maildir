Only if it's not a good idea to do debugging in a multi-user 
environment.
gdb makes it quite simple to call target program functions from inside a
debugging session.  Imagine that someone works out how to insert a trojan
inside a core file (I dunno -- by mucking up a jump table or some such).
Even worse if someone has a reason to be debugging as root...
So, maybe it's a low risk, but it's not no risk.
