So what?

Go back and read.

Nor yours.  Just because you can't get your mind around a concept 
doesn't mean that it's a bad concept, and that no one else can use it.

Actually, they do -- ext3 was experimental once.  ReiserFS was very 
experimental once.
Please stop bashing it just because it's new/experimental.

Smaller (and thus faster) on supported systems, otherwise exactly the 
same, but maybe a little more modular, which is good.

I never said that, but for one thing, whether they do or not, it's nice 
if my shell and my editor and all the other things that I use don't have 
to agree on anything to manipulate the formats involved.
This is not just about GNOME/KDE.  It is about GNOME/KDE not developing 
an additional layer, that you wouldn't like anyway, that cannot be 
accessed from anything except GNOME/KDE.
