Yes, it used to work.  I have sometimes had to help the boot
scripts as the "gave up" when modprobe failed.  But
it always worked after setting up the mixer manually.
Sometime before 2.5.47 ALSA broke, at least for trident.
I haven't tested if it works with modules - if it don't
work compiled-in it don't work for me.  I don't get all the devices
either.

Yes, and also avoiding the maintenance of modules.conf, extra
devfs issues, and so on for only a little extra memory.
