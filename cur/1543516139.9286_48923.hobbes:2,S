Hi,
Regarding the internal compiler error I was getting, I
recieved a load of responses. One of them suggested
that the processor cooling fan might not be moving the
air properly. I opened the case, and sure enough an
IDE cable was blocking the fan. After I tied that up,
the problem has stopped occuring. So thanks to all who
replied. I love LINUX and I love the support I get by
using it.
Thanks
