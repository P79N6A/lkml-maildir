When the child doesn't send SIGCHLD (clone() lets you do evil things :)
Seriously though, that may be an option. Scott (CC'd ) is primarily the 
consumer of this, so he can better comment.

Yeah, I ripped this up because during debugging poll was behaving oddly, 
and I had been instrumenting the code with printks. It can go back to 
being 1 line now.

Wow... and I read this patch before I sent it, too *facepalm*
The function did briefly return a siginfo_t (I implemented on top of 
waitid first).
