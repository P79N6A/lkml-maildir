I think the right thing to do is do both of these things. I already 
applied Hugh's patch - it seemed like a total nobrainer to do at this 
stage in the 2.6.22 -rc series. But that doesn't mean that we should not 
_also_ look at "flush_dcache_page()" users.
I do think that even just the name (the ".._page()" part) makes it obvious 
that it was designed for page-level allocations, not kmalloc(). So I think 
Christoph's patch makes sense in that context.
At the same time, I do think that the whole notion of flushing the D$ is 
certainly something that makes sense for kmalloc() allocations also, and 
maybe people do actually do small DMA allocations and Christophs patch 
would break that.
End result: for 2.6.22, I think the patch from Hugh that I already applied 
is the right thing. 
But as to 2.6.23 and onward.. I dunno.
