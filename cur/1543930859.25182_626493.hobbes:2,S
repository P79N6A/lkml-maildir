David,
With your suggestions, I'm feeling a doubt at e1000.
It's seems to me e1000_clean does call netif_rx_complete and returns
non-zero work_done when !netif_running()
So net_rx_action has (work == weight) as true with NAPI_STATE_SCHED cleared.
Here is the e1000_clean.
static int
e1000_clean(struct napi_struct *napi, int budget)
{
    /* Keep link state information with original netdev */
    if (!netif_carrier_ok(poll_dev))
        goto quit_polling;
...
    adapter->clean_rx(adapter, &adapter->rx_ring[0],
                      &work_done, budget);
    /* If no Tx and not enough Rx work done, exit the polling mode */
    if ((!tx_cleaned && (work_done == 0)) ||
       !netif_running(poll_dev)) {
quit_polling:
        if (likely(adapter->itr_setting & 3))
            e1000_set_itr(adapter);
        netif_rx_complete(poll_dev, napi);
        e1000_irq_enable(adapter);
    }
    return work_done;
}
Thanks.
