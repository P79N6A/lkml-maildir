You beat me to the answer. I was re-writing this to use a pointer,
not an already allocated data object that exists in the .bss section.
This was to show how it's usually done. Basically, SHM_RND may round
down so, with odd-sized mapping, you have to be careful.
Since I did not think it should work, I tried first to initialize
global01_, which would put it into the .data section. This didn't
work either so I don't think the demo code is supposed to work.
Cheers,
