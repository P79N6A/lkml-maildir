I'd advice you to seriously look over your network, are you 100% sure you
don't have a duplex-issue anywhere?
I've been running linuxrouters for quite a while and right now I have a few
linuxrouters routing 100Mbit/s internetconnections. We have never had any
problems like the one you describe so my first guess would be that you
have a duplexproblem, probably between the linuxrouter and the switch it's
connected to on the inside, that's usually where it's located. Or maybe
between some switches or something but do look into this. I seriously
doubt that this a problem with the networking in linux.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
