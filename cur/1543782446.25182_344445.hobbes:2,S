I get slightly worse performance on this system when running RH9
with kernel 2.4.29 (my hacks, HZ=1000, SMP).  Tried increasing
e1000 descriptors to 2048 tx and rx, but that didn't help, or at least
not much.
Will try some other tunings, but I doubt it will affect performance
enough to come close to the discrepency that you show between 2.4
and 2.6 kernels...
I tried copying a 500MB CDROM to HD on my RH9 system, and only 6kpps
of the 250kpps get through the bridge...btw.
