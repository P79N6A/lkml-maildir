Hi!
As of 2.4.21-pre harddisks that I attach to a secondary PDC20268 don't
show up (although correctly detected) in /proc/partitions. Instead the
/dev/hda's partition table is cloned ...
As this box has two pdc20268 (promise tx2) ide controllers I can
reproduce this behaviour on both of them with different harddisks.
Linux was booting using a harddisk on the onboard via vt8235 chipset
(asus a7v8x).
This problem does not occur with 2.4.20. 
I will happily supply additional information if needed.
Thanks,
Soeren.
