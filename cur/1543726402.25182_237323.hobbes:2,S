Make smp_processor_id check if preempt_count() is non-zero to make sure 
that you're running within a non-preemptable critical section (scheduler
deferred). Do the same with local_irq_* critical section by checking to
see if interrupts are disabled. They are also non-preemptable (hardware
defered).
That's my suggestion.
