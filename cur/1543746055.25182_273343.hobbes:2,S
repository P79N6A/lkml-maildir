Chris, 
The kill-from-kswapd approach on top of recent -mm which includes 
"ignore referenced information on zero priority" should be quite 
reliable. Would be nice if you could try that. 
The current scheme is broken yes, the main problem being the all_unreclaimable
logic which conflicts with OOM detection - I (we) were hoping 
"ignore-referenced-information-on-zero-priority" would be enough for 99% of 
cases, but it doesnt seem so.
Either way killing from kswapd or from task context all_unreclaimable logic 
is conflitant with OOM detection.
But we are going the right way :)
