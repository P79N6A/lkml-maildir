I'm not suggesting that anyone waste any time over this, but are there any
"real world" benchmarks of the "fastest" vs "non cache-polluting"
algorithms.
Could there be any situations whereby even with cache-pollution we'd get
better performance?
I know it depends on the workload mix and amount of I/O, but...
Just curious.
