And again: it won't matter.  split-include.c does *not* need a specific
version of kernel headers installed.  Any helper program that *does*
depend on kernel constants should use -I$(HPATH).  (I would expect to
find such in places like arch/*/boot/.)  This one *doesn't*.
So you can just put back your symlink or whatever, it'll be fine.  I
compile multiple kernel versions all the time too; my <linux/*.h>
doesn't ever point to current kernel source and it's never bitten me.

Not to me.  I recently sent Michael Chastain a patch to fix the $(CC)
thing.  He agrees with the intent and the approach and has indicated
that he will likely send it on to Linus some time soon.  Perhaps this
explains why I really can't agree with your suggestion to do more or
less the reverse.

I know.
