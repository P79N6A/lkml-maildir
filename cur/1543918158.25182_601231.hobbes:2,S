Subject: [PATCH] Fix up SH DMAC code to correctly handle PVR DMA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch fixes up SH DMAC code to correctly handle channel 2 DMA on
the Dreamcast.
Points to note:
* Currently the comments say that dar must be set - this appears to be
incorrect
* Currently the code uses calc_xmit_shift(chan) though that fuction does
not appear to work - this code relies on a division by 32 before the
xfer function is called
* Currently the code supports reading and writing, but the hardware only
supports writing
