.. but not abotu the kernel that it depends on.
In other words, if driverloader was a stand-alone project, you could do 
whatever the hell you wanted with it.
But it isn't a standalone project, is it? It depends on the kernel, and 
there is no question that driverloader is a derived work.
Which means that you had better follow the rules.
So stop yer whining. When you write your own operating system, and your 
driver doesn't have to depend on anybody elses code, then you can set the 
rules. As it is, the kernel requires modules to tell it their license, and 
if you lie to it, that is not only potentially violating the DMCA, it's 
also likely a crime under regular copyright laws (ie you are knowingly 
misrepresenting a license - in this case the license of the binary part, 
and that's not legal either).

Oh, so it's ok to do something illegal, because it helps usability? And 
ethics take second place to "the user doesn't want to see that line in the 
logs"?
Sure, that's a good argument. NOT.
GET RID OF YOUR LYING LICENSE LINE!
