Hm, or more specifically, why would that be a problem for softlockup? 
Do you mean it doesn't measure time during ACPI idle?   That would just
make it trigger later than it would otherwise.
Andrew is reporting that it is triggering very early, and making the
machine feel jerky.  How can that be related to sched_clock's quality,
unless its too broken to be useful to anyone for anything?
