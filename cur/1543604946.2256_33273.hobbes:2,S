RAM is cheap :). BIOS is the latest available from Tyan for this board.

->pio is almost never a sane setting; certainly not for a dtla.
I moved the IBM drive to another system and experienced a lockup. A
search showed that some BIOS/chipsets locked when these drives reported
as UDMA 100 and a solution is to use the IBM "dft 2.30" to cause the
drive to report itself at some lower capability. This worked in the
other system so I tried the drive in the VIA chipset system again. It
still locks.
->mixing vendors on the same cable is asking for trouble;
Tested with both and with each.
->do you see problems with just one disk per channel?
Yes.

Tested as slave, master on secondary, not connected.

->preferably with 80-conductor cables?)
That's an interesting point. This thing does not like 80 conductor
cables at all. I first suspected a damaged motherboard instead of a
buggy chipset/BIOS. I went through all tests at
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-hw1/
 and
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-hw2/
 to check the
hardware. Continuous kernel compiles overnight caused no locks using
default Debian (stable) kernel. memtest86 ran its full test (over 10
hours) with no problems.

APM is disabled in BIOS.

D'oh! Thanks, I will try that.
Update: system locked overnight using 2.2.19 with ext3 while doing
apt-get dist-upgrade. Some directories were mounted via NFS, but it
locks under 2.4.x whether NFS is involved or not. Will go back to 2.2.19
with ext2 and see how long it can do disk work.
