Ok, I've fixed it.
I just didn't know that this also belongs to coding style (I don't
like goto's much and it isn't in CodingStyle ;-).

Hmh, you remind me about one thing that I'm constantly forgetting.
In fact allocation will stay (it is dynamic queue and it must be that way)
but I should use there list.h stuff. My fault.

Of course. I just wanted to be fair. There were pointed out main
differences (in first place) and some advantages.

wait_event is rather not good as I don't have condition to check - in that
case I just place process in a queue and wait for wake_up.
But I agree that it is ugly - I used it only as a quick fix for one bug.
Now I think I have good solution but I have to test it first.
Thanks for advices - new patch will be placed on
www.mat.uni.torun.pl/~wrona/posix_ipc
on Tuesday along with new library.
