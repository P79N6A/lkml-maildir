My main concern is that when I picked up ieee1394 maint myself, it was
because it was not big-endian or 64-bit friendly. I spent the better
part of 3 months getting this right on PPC and UltraSPARC. Not because
it's hard to fix these issues, but because the hardware is not well
defined for a lot of these cases (I know you've seen the ohci1394 code
to handle endianness).
So while I can understand that ieee1394 doesn't have much man power
right now, and that there are some hard to find bugs in the current
tree, I can't see how starting from scratch alleviates this.
The tree is years old, and a lot of work has been put into it (lots of
my work, I'll admit I'm being a little protective). I'm not sure that
"replacing" it is wise, or even needed. Fork it, clean it up, but
rewriting just doesn't make sense.
Granted, this is your time, and you can spend it how you want, I just
don't want to see the ieee1394 stack take a step backwards in the hopes
that it will be better a year down the road.
