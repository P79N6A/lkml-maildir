Subject: 2.6.9 won't compile

Dear all,
I downloaded version 2.6.9 of the kernel from kernel.org
I went throught menuconfig, importing the configuration of my current
2.6.15-28-686.
I then tried to compile it but the compilation exits with an error
(below).
I also tried to do make mrproper, got rid of the .config file, made
menuconfig again without importing anything, and when compiling it
failed again.
The reason for me to use this kernel is because I have a VIA VT82C
693A/598/686 chipset and I suffer from perf problems (which google says
only happen since 2.6.10).
Might I request to be personally CC'ed in the answers/comments posted in
response to this post ?
Many thanks in advance for your comments and help!
With kind regards,
Pedro Mullor
