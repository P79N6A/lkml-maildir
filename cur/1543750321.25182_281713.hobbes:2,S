Look at Table 1 page 2 (pin description). There is a table which details
which data goes on the bus for each address in read and in write mode.
If you read address 3, it should return the control reg (according to
the table).

Have you tried delaying more ?
Honnestly, I don't remember if I have ever read the control reg. Since it's
more of a command than a register, it does not make much sense (depending
on bit 7, it does different things). So at most, you would read the last
command sent to the chip. I don't know if this can be very useful.

Willy
