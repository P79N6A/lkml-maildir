Probably legacy mode always routes to CPU #0. Makes sense and is
not really a misconfiguration of legacy mode.
But if CPU #0 has interrupts disabled no interrupts get delivered.
So choices are:
- Move to CPU #0
- Do not use legacy mode during shutdown.
- Or do not rely on interrupts after enabling legacy mode
- Or do not disable interrupts on the other CPUs when they're
halted.
First and last option are probably unreliable for the kdump case.
Second or third sound best. 
I suspect the real fix would be to enable IOAPIC mode really
early and never use the timers in legacy mode. Then the kdump
kernel wouldn't care about the legacy mode pointing to the wrong CPU.
IIrc Eric even had  a patch for that a long time ago, but it broke some 
things so it wasn't included. But perhaps it should be revisited.
