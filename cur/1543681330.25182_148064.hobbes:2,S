Anything beyond basic host-only TOE adds massive complexity for very 
little gain:  interfacing netfilter and routing code with a black box we 
_hope_ will act properly sounds like suicide.

All this is vague handwaving without supporting evidence.  So far we get 
stuff like Internet2 speed records _without_ TOE.  And Linux currently 
supports 10gige...  and hosts are just going to keep getting faster and 
faster.
