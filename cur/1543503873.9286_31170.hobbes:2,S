I thought that. But I wasn't at all sure of the level of support, of
even the level of lack of support/uncooperativeness you had. So i
didn't want to speculate.

  Duh, have you ever tried to read and understand "three card monty"
  design of "CheckUPS II".  It is as bad as the canned packages that create
  the miniport interface for M$'s API.
I remember only that only a year or two ago (before you cracked
'SmartUPS') that buying an APC for use with linux was money wasted.
You couldn't use the extra features of the APC. But if you bought a
Best then you could use all the features - no matter what Unix you
used. And if it sucked then you could improve it for private use.
  
I can't comment about the code, i havn't seen it or used it. But i do
think the fact that it was there is a point in favour of Best.
  > which one do you trust/respect the most?
  
  Company or Hardware?
i think they're both important factors. And let's face it, both the
APC and Best UPS's meet the bar in terms of hardware
features/quality. They both do the job. They both do pretty much the
same thing, or at least as far my standards are concerned.
So the next factor becomes the Company. Which one has the better
attitude? Which one do you want to reward with your money? In my case
I'd rather reward Best for co-operating from the beginning, rather
than APC for making things difficult.
  Something born of OpenSource fighting to live?
  	or
  Three Card Monty, that claims to be a token gift.
  
  Now for the final note::
  
  They have one or two guys.......
  	or
  All of opensource and many of the finest minds in computing to day!!!
  
True. But i assume Best wouldn't be averse to patches. OpenSource
won, but wouldn't if be nicer if APC had co-operated? Then maybe
those who bought SmartUPS could have got the full-use of them a lot
earlier. And what happens if APC next revision of SmartUPS is again
closed and you're not around to crack it?
Basically, When the hardware is pretty level, which corporate outlook
do you support and reward?
The triumph of opensource over corporate hostility is another matter.
You are to be commended for getting the software out there, but APC
shouldn't be.
If your fight has made APC see the light, then i'll change my
attitude.
