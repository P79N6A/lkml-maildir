No, I'm not. I'm not suggesting that no compensation for the fact that 
disks and filesystems go bad is needed. What I'm saying is that that
compensation should not need to be application-level. If I need to do
a lot of checksumming and manual parity calculation and such in my
application, then either the OS author or whoever put together my
machine seriously fucked up somewhere. If my data gets silently
corrupted without me noticing for months or years, then there are
problems that no SCM can solve.
Also, I'm not claiming that having an SCM do extra stuff like
corruption checking is bad. It's pretty cool, actually. But you made
it sound like Peter should be run out of town and have small children
publically mock him for not building it into his system. That's not
just wrong, it's rude.

"you and your buddies"? "you aren't exactly representative"?
Larry, could you do me a favor? Could you be a little more
condescending? I almost got the impression for a second there that you 
might possibly have the tiniest smidgeon of respect for someone who
might dare to disagree with you.
We have over five years worth of research code in our repository. I
think that's more than a little effort, and we're definitely worried
about protecting it. That's why we make sure it's regularly backed up
and we often burn snapshots to CDROM. We may be a little insignificant
research group and not big important Captains Of Industry, but we do
care about our code. Our sponsors, who _are_ Captains Of Industry,
also care about our code and us not losing it, so that's a little
extra motivation right there.
Also, if I buy BitKeeper, store lots of important code in it, and it
fucks up my repository, what can I do? I mean, I can whine about it a
lot in public, which might make me feel better, but can I do anything
that gets me my code back or provides me with actual compensation? Can 
I get a refund? Can I sue you? Can I say "He did it! Blame him!" to my 
boss or my sponsors? If the system breaks, then fundamentally I really 
don't care whose fault it is, I just want my data back.
> You'd have a point if RCS told you when there is a problem, but it doesn't.
RCS shouldn't have to do this. If I need my data uncorrupted, I'd
better use mirrored disks with parity. If I might need data for months 
or years, I'd better have offsite backups and burn important bits onto 
CD in case a tape dies.
It's nice if my application helps me out there, but if I'm depending
on it doing so, then I deserve to lose my data when it fails. I'm sure 
BK's integrity system is nice, but I think I'd prefer to have more
than a single piece of software to fall back on.

Can you explain to me where you got this "Nat uses raw RCS with no
other safeguards" strawman from? I'd really love to know.
In practice, stuff breaks and overheats and catches fire and get
stolen and deleted and lost and water damaged and what have you. Will
BitKeeper protect me from that too? If so, cool, sign me up. If not,
pardon me for wanting to have safeguards other than some piece of
software.
> Great.  I'm equally uncomfortable with you not paying for it in that case.
I'm glad to know our research isn't pure enough for you, Larry. Will
you admit that maybe all the people who complain that when you call
BitKeeper "open" you don't actually mean "open" have a point now, please?

Funny, a few messages ago you seemed to be saying something totally
different -- it was more like "Why would you be stupid enough to use
Aegis when you could use BitKeeper instead, which will solve all your
problems and make toast for you in the morning?".
Part of the point here is that those of us outside of BitMover and the 
beta groups really have no idea whether BK will solve ANY of the
problems that CVS, Perforce, ClearCase, Aegis, or whatever don't. You
say they will, but you haven't produced anything to back it up with.
You attack Peter for having the temerity to think that he's produced a 
good system by waving your ridiculously expensive vaporware around,
and then when someone mentions a much cheaper product that a lot of
people are pretty happy with from an actual commercial company with
support, you get huffy. I'm just trying to point out that BitKeeper is 
not the only game in town, no matter how much you love it. Yelling at
people will never convince them that BitKeeper is good. Only BitKeeper 
itself can do that. Yelling will only make them think you're arrogant
and obnoxious, and wonder what kind of support you'll provide. That's
no help.

Right, so I'm at exactly the same place I would be if I used
Aegis. Since something Linux shows us that users can keep free
software alive and make it great, I'm not screwed. I'm okay. Except,
wait, no, I'm not. I'm also out an eighth of a million dollars.
Fuck, I guess I _am_ screwed.

But you jumped into it and harangued him about it. "He started it" is
not and never has been a good excuse for this sort of thing, Larry.
Uh, I mean, "Larry, my man".
(hint: take the marketing hat off. talk about the technical
 details. give us reasons other than "because I say so". accept that
 others can be more than just mouth-breathing annoyances. we'll like
 you for it. really. we might even buy your software.)
(especially if you consider adding an educational discount. education
 is the future, y'know.)
