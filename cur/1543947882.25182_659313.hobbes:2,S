Thanks for reviewing. Was it the patch I sent to Larry Finger
with the subject line "[PATCH] Fix the bcm43xx driver breakage in 2.6.24/25"
or the patch I sent with the first email in this thread? The patches are
generally the same, but the one sent to Larry was split into two pieces
and the condition on which the bcm43xx config option was hidden
changed a bit.

I'm quite sure my patch won't cause any problems, but if Greg
wants to be 100% sure there won't be any regressions introduced
in -stable, reverting the said commit should be the right thing.
