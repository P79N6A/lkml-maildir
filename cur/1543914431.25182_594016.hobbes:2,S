ive restricted the .S check to arch/blackfin/, but the other check
should be run on all .c files since Blackfin drivers may live anywhere
in the tree, not just in arch/ ... i really doubt that'd be a problem
unless another architecture starts implementing functions with
"__builtin_bfin_ssync" in its name ...
side note, Joe pointed out that arch/blackfin regex should be m@...@, not s@...@
