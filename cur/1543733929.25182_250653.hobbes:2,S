I'll follow up shortly with a task_mem()/task_mem_cheap() consolidation
patch atop the others I sent.

I'm not aware of a discrepancy with the fs/proc/task_nommu.c code; I
did, however, have to mangle the things via guesswork to avoid adding
the new fields, which I really wanted you to arrange for or comment on
as they are a matter of interface. Also, could you be more specific
about these discrepancies?
