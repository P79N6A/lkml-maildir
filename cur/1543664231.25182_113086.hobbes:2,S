Works for me, but I'm curious if it works for Rusty. We're still not sure 
if he's hitting the same bug... but I guess it's rather early morning in 
.au. :-)
Oh, and 2.4 needs the same fix -- and if Mikael's original BUG_ON() is 
undesirable then we should probably also remove this code from 2.4's 
apic.c:setup_local_APIC()
        if (!clustered_apic_mode && 
            !test_bit(GET_APIC_ID(apic_read(APIC_ID)), &phys_cpu_present_map))
                BUG();
because it's essentially the same test as the BUG_ON(), at least for the 
UP case.
Thanks,
Ion
