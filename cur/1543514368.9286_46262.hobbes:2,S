I'd like to just plead with people _not_ to use xchg unnecessarily.
On PA-RISC, it is going to _suck_.  PA-RISC's only atomic instruction
is load-and-zero.  Therefore we have to have a spinlock in our generic
xchg implementation.  And disable interrupts.  Ugh.  It's OK if you
xchg something with zero though, and most of the xchg's in the kernel
are with zero.
