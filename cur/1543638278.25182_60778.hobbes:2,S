First, we were talking about written for free vs. written to make money.
Second, the quality of the output depends on the quality of the process,
not how much you pay for it. Equally likely isn't what I said, either.
One last time: commercial software is not a guaranty of quality nor is
being free an indication of being shoddy. Clearly if you underpay people
for any work you are likely to get poor work, but that doesn't apply to
someone who is being paid in satisfaction and recognition, and who has a
real motivation to do it to the best of her/his ability.

Glad it reminds you, I sure as hell don't see the point... and I never saw
any such thing. Studies show that locking people up longer doesn't make
*that person* less likely to commit a crime, which is not at all the same
thing as the crime rate in crimes per unit time by all persons.
