Well, under the system I'm currently envisioning, the driver would be 
able to provide the data needed by the mii bus, but the hope would be 
to enable board files (for when the PHY is soldered on the motherboard, 
and the enet is not -- like on an MPC85xx) to provide this information 
instead, and leave out the enet as middleman.

I really don't want the driver to intantiate PHYs directly.  The PHY is 
its own device, and the less net drivers have to understand their inner 
workings, the better.  However, I hadn't considered the possibility of 
multiple MACs sharing the same PHY.  It does, as you say, support my 
argument, though.  With some careful design, the mii bus should be able 
to handle this type of setup easily.
One of my goals, personally, is to allow multiple net drivers to share 
the same mii bus, as in the case of the FCC enet controllers' PHYs on 
an 8560 ADS, which can be accessed through TSEC1's MII Management bus.

So when you say instantiated, would you consider calling an "attach" 
function with the phy_id and bus_id of the desired PHY instantiation?  
I'm fine with that.  The PHY would need to be able to send 
notifications to the enet controller (currently done through a 
callback).  I'm interested in ideas on how the notifier could be used 
(I have a distaste for callbacks).
Autopoll features sound pretty neat.  I think the system should support 
that.  PHY interrupts are supported (they work quite well on my 85xx 
system), as is timer-based polling.  Do you really think that there are 
special cases which can't be handled using a library similar to the 
sungem_phy one?

Yeah, that sounds good.
