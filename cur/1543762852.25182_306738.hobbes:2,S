Right, but that is not the point. If you need to look closely at the GPL
part, or swipe stuff from other GPLed code that uses the same interface,
the result might have to be GPL.

The problem is that noone is sure what exactly qualifies as "derived work",
and what can be used/copied without concern for infringement (Can you use
declarations of stuff in a public .h? What if the .h is "local use" in the
code? Can you write your own declarations matching what you find in random
code, and use them? What about inlined functions?  Lists of e.g. IOCTL
codes or system calls?). Does it matter that you are writing your stuff for
compatibility with what is out there, or to add functionality? Does it
matter if you are just using "standard" interfases to the GPLed stuff
(whatever that means in each case)? How much copying makes it derived? 1
line, 5%, what?
