sysfs doesn't do quite that level of categorization; if it did, cdrom_id 
would be unnecessary. It would be nice if you could do 
"grep 1 /sys/block/*/burns_cds" and get a list of all the block devices in 
your system that burn cds. (You can currently get a list of all of the 
removable block devices in your system, but not much else.)
The kernel must know a bunch of this sort of stuff, and it would be nice 
if the information available. (In fact, there's a lot that's in /proc/ide 
that isn't in /sys, which is a bit annoying, since it would be useful in 
/sys, especially if it would mean that you could ignore details of what 
kind of bus things were on.)
