Hi!
I tried to modify kernel2-4-18 for checkpointing and
recovering(s.t. fault tolerance)
When I measure duration time for checkpointing and
recovering in kernel mode, I found there is some
problem with measuring accurate duration time using
gettimeofday().
My watch said ten seconds is past, but kernel said
only 1 second!!
Is there other method or function for figuring out
duration time in kernel mode?
