Hello!

The access to last_ino is serialized by spin lock, so that
it is allowed to be not-atomic.
Real bug is inside grow_inodes(), which calls prune_dcache() in turn.
And nobody took care of poor dcache in 2.3, so that it stands now
as bone in throat and all similar operations require big kernel lock.
