It shouldn't. HTTP, etc. will transfer 
the default stream only.

Yes.

Interesting idea -- an option on pax to
unravel a streamed file into a directory
structure on FSes that do not support
streams. So "foo.txt:default" would become
"foo.txt/foo.txt". On a streams-capable
FS, it would simply restore the file with
streams intact, so "foo.txt" is what you
expect. And if you don't want streams
restored on non-streams FSes, then it simply
discards them.
