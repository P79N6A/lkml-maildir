Then every driver must implement it's own ioctl() and utility.

mv sethdlc.c hdlctool.c ?

I'd rather have hdlc_device pointing to it's own net_device instead of 
embedding it directly but I won't fight too much about this (so far :o) ).

Yes, it's used. It may/will be done slightly differently.

{hdlc/line}_settings are defined in hdlc/ioctl.h
Others layer 2 protocols may use if_settings (they don't seem to be in a
hurry though :o) ).

Imho hacking drivers/net/wan/hdlc_fr.c::fr_rx() and hdlc/ioctl.h isn't
the hardest part of ppp-over-fr for those who really need it.

Do you have a specific protocol in mind ?

Admitting there is a heap of ppp-over-fr code waiting to be included and
even if someone is ready to code this all, I'm for a lazyer solution. :o)
