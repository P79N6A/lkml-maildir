Sorry, I don't understand. AFAICS, if the driver does not have a
ioctl_compat() file op, it will only be called for those ioctl numbers
that are registered in fs/compat_ioctl.c, but not for the ones that were
added by a third party module.
If it has a ioctl_compat() function, it can handle its own ioctls including
those that are dynamically added, but not any generic ones that have static
conversion functions in fs/compat_ioctl.c. Do you mean it should call back
from its private ioctl_compat() function to the global ioctl32_hash_table[]
lookup?
