Marcelo:
Initially some non-inline/non-gcc34 related backports
sneaked in the original patch and this was why I splitted
the patch up.
These hunk are, as they're labelled, fixes from 2.6 while
we are working on the intermezzo directory:  While hunting
for the many changes for the intermezzo inline fixes in
the other trees, I also caught these ones and thought that
you may be interested in them.
Feel free to apply or dump them.

Ozkan,
What is this about?
I can't understand this as trivial gcc3.4 inline fixes.
