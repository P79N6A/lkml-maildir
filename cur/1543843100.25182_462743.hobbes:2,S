Hmmm...  You're right.  However, note binfmt_elf_fdpic().  This calls ksize()
but should really call kobjsize().  It should not assume that the allocation
it's been given is of any particular type.  IIRC ksize() changed purpose at
some point.

ramfs for example.  See get_unmapped_area() hooks, not mmap() hooks.

Yeah.  It might be worth ditching it entirely too.
