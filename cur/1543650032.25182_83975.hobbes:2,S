Does your swap partition show up in /proc/swaps? It has to contain
something like this:
Filename			Type		Size	Used	Priority
/dev/hda6                       partition	506008	0	-1
Btw, do you see something swap-related in dmesg? Like:
  Unable to find swap-space signature
  Unable to handle swap header version ...
  Swap area shorter than signature indicates
  Empty swap-file
And do you actually see something like this:
  Adding Swap: 506008k swap-space (priority -1)
How did you initialized the swap partition? Recent kernels support both
v1 and v2 swaps, which is can be set for mkswap using -v0 (-v1).
Actually i mean did you initialized it at all? 8)
