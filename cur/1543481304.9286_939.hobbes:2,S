In v2.0 kernels the maximum process limits could be edited in the limits.h
file, with a re-compile it could be upped quickly.  We migrated our Alphas
to 2.2.0pre7ac4 and I can no longer find any information on how to up the
max process limit.  Is there a sysctl for this or is it done 'dynamically'? 
If it is handled dynamically I would like to say that it does not work.
The second I hit 512 processes nothing can fork.  I just need to bump this
up to around 2048, some information on how to do this would be very handy.
Thanks, and everything is looking very nice.
