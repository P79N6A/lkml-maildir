This is a typo fix that is needed :: linux/include/linux/filter.h
-extern int sk_run_filter(unsigned char *data, 
+extern int sk_run_filter(struct sk_buff *skb, 
However this is only partial and breakage is still present.
From "linux/include/net/sock.h"
#ifdef CONFIG_FILTER
        /* Socket Filtering Instructions */
        struct sk_filter        *filter;
#endif /* CONFIG_FILTER */
I believe that "struct sk_filter" is not define or incorrect reference,
or I am blind and can't read.........
Lastly function "sk_filter_len(??)" is no where to be found either.
This is my WAG but I'm sure it is wrong..............
extern __inline__ unsigned sk_filter_len(struct sk_filter *fp)
{
/*
        return blah_blah->something;
*/
        return fp->len;
}
