If you aren't planning to use locking; you can use knfsd or unfsd.
If you do want to use locking then knfsd is your only choice.
You should also get better performance from knfsd.  You should
check 
http://csua.berkeley.edu/~gam3/knfsd/
 for the latest patches.
What I would do is use autofs and knfsd for /home.  If you have
the diskspace using rsynce should be more robust than nfs for
/opt and /usr.
