I'm trying to nail down what is causing this problem but I suspect
it is the FPU changes in p8 that are breaking my box.. it will boot
fine until it has to create module dependencies (which is the first
spot that actually uses the fpu module, although it is not a module
on my box).. it hangs.
I don't have time right now to trace the crash but it is a hard lock
that I had to big red button.
Anyone else with a multia have trouble with p8?
p6 runs great (what I'm under now)
