I have never had any luck with that driver. The problems with it seem to
vary from one type of motherboard to another. I think I have the v90Q
driver on one machine at work. What I had to do there was send a couple of
pings immediately after I ifconfig the interface up. If the interface sat
unused for more than a few seconds after ifconfig, it would not work. So
my network startup script on that machine now sends ping -c 2 192.168.50.1
>/dev/null and THAT machine works. 
In any case, I have not been lucky enough to have ANY machine where the
supplied driver works. I will drag the v90Q driver over there and see if
that will fix it.
