You are right that the patch is possibly not fully correct. I was trying 
to fix the situation I was getting into with the bug in usb_resume_both() 
(see my "[PATCH] 2.6.18-rc6-mm2 - usb_resume_both() - fix suspend/resume" 
mail from yesterday), but now it is obvious that the EINVAL from UHCI is 
of a "different kind" than EBUSY from OHCI and UHCI (though they are 
triggered in the same situations -- when the previous resume was not done 
correctly).
As far as I can see, the UHCI driver is, strangely enough, not using 
hcd->state at all. 
(by the way, EHCI and OHCI seem to have broken (read: missing) locking 
when accessing the hcd->state. Should I fix it by per-hcd spinlock, or 
does the patch already exist somewhere?)
Thanks,
