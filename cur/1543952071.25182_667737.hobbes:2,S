Looks good in general.  What's left in bitops_{32,64}.h now?

This comment seems wrong.  My "man ffs" says that it returns 1-32 for 
non-zero inputs, and 0 for a zero input.  This function returns 0-31, or 
-1 for a zero input.
DESCRIPTION
       The ffs() function returns the position of the first (least significant)
       bit set in the word i.  The least significant bit is position 1 and  the
       most  significant  position  is,  for example, 32 or 64.   The functions
       ffsll() and ffsl() do the same but take arguments of possibly  different
       size.
RETURN VALUE
       These  functions  return  the  position of the first bit set, or 0 if no
       bits are set in i.

The prevailing style in bitops.h is to use "bsf"/"cmovz" and let the 
compiler work out the size from the register names.

And this comment is even more wrong, given that ffs and fls are 
completely different functions ;)
I know these are from the original, but its worth fixing given that 
you're touching it anyway.
