Traverse (www.traverse.com.au) supplies a binary driver
module for its Pulsar ADSL PCI Modem.  Binary modules are
available for some obsolete kernel versions for ITEX based
modems.  (Know of any others?)
I would like there to be a free driver for one or more PCI
ADSL modems.  Unfortunately, it looks like it would be a lot
of work to write one.  Does anyone out there have any
relevant experience to share?
