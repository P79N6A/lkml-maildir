Subject: [2.6.1 MCE falseness?] Hardware reports non-fatal error

I get the following problem with 2.6.1 consistently after apm resuming:
"ksyrium kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable
incident occurred on CPU 0.
Message from syslogd@ksyrium at Wed Jan 14 13:33:06 2004 ...
ksyrium kernel: Bank 1: f2000000000001c5"
It does not happen on any other kernels I use (vanilla 2.4.24, SuSE 9
2.4.21-166) - even though CONFIG_X86_MCE=y for both. The equipment is
brand-new - an IBM Thinkpad R50P - and it passes all IBM's s/w
diagnostic.
I'd appreciate help with the parameters for parsemce to interpret the
problem...not sure if my usage is correct? ;)
# ./parsemce -b 1 -a 0 -e f2000000000001c5
Status: (f2000000000001c5) Machine Check in progress.
Restart IP valid.
Is this really hardware (maybe a bug in  the BIOS?) or are false
positives possible with 2.6 MCE code?
