Patch applied.
So in summary, patch 1 has been applied with some additional changes.
Patch 2 is applied as is except for a change to accomodate the cpu->be
change from Denis.
Patches 3-5 have been made redundant by the cpu->be change.
Thanks again for your efforts in making sha1 smaller and faster.
Cheers,
