But you can build a call graph with the function tracer, that what
does the script draw_trace.py
in a bit loosely way for example.
IMHO, function cost measurement or call graphs are particular uses
that can be made of this engine.
You can also use it to trace function return values for example.
The general sense of this is more about return hooking.
But....
Perhaps defining it as a "return" tracer is not easy to understand at
a first sight and could bring developpers
on misinterpretation (sorry does this word exist?).
So perhaps naming it by thinking on the purpose it could be use at
most would be better that its "general" or "potential"
purpose. I don't know...

If we convey/consider it on a sight where it is capable on several
things, so a more generic name should be chosen.
