  "At all" is not what I would say. Of course noone is trying to defend
  just at the kernel level. But I believe every step to make the linux
  kernel less trickable to such exploitation of TCP implementation
  "weaknesses", and also trying to make linux kernel behave less like
  a TCP flood amplifier, is welcomed (without serious or harmful
  "violation" of the protocol).
  Untill some other way comes up, I will try out Alan's patch. I believe
  it will help a lot, in conjuction with ipfw and some kind of dynamic
  manipulation of it.
  Thanks Alan Cox and everyone else.
