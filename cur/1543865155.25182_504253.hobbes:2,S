As you can see in the error-log including in the Ubuntu bug report, the
51/04 errors are generated in dma_intr() and occur in the initial phase
when the driver is using DMA.
After a  few of these errors it disables DMA and switches to PIO mode,
which is when the 59/04 errors are generated in task_in_intr().
