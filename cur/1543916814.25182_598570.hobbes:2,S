Hi!
Following Christoph's usual nitpicking and Randy's suggestions to put the sample
code in the new samples/ kernel directory, I made modifications to the markers.
The result is that the marker code holds into a single patch; other patches are
for menus, documentation and samples.
Here is the updated version for 2.6.23-rc8-mm1.
It applies in this order:
kconfig-instrumentation.patch
linux-kernel-markers.patch
add-samples-subdir.patch
linux-kernel-markers-samples.patch
linux-kernel-markers-documentation.patch
