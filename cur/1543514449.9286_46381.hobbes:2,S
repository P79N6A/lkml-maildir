Subject: changes to rlimit struct in 2.3.24

The changes in include/linux/resource.h of the rlimit struct seem to
cause some strange problems with various programs.  ulimit under bash
shows the limit on cpu time to be -1; similar results occur with limit
under tcsh and gnome-pty-helper's sanity checks receive similar results.  
Although the programs could probably all be fixed with source-level
changes, is there a way around it other than recompiling the apps?  It
wouldn't be a good thing to have to have all users recompile all of
their apps which check limits when 2.4 comes out :)
