The GPL does not talk about the code to create things, but code to
_modify_ things. If you never have to modify the firmware file, where is
the point?
I do not see a big difference between firmware data stored in a flash
rom inside of the hardware part and the same data loaded during the
driver initialisation. In contrary, it saves money and makes things more
flexible. You should thank your hardware manufacturer instead of
bitching about bogus things.
Regards,
Eduard.
