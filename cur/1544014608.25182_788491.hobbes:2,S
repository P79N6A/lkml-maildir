Well, the code is to process when the kernel is told about leap seconds
(it doesn't have to be NTP, you can do it with adjtimex, which is what I
did to track down the problem).
But why should it be removed?  Why change Linux to be incompatible with
POSIX and other Unix systems?  This could create real problems with
things like network file systems for example.  Even trying to get
interoperation between UTC-Linux and TAI-Linux would be a PITA.
There was a bug, there is a patch, it should be fixed.  There's no
reason to reinvent the wheel just because there was a bug.
Looking at comments, there was another bug related to the same
xtime_lock/printk issue but not in leap second related code; it was
trying to print a message about changing clock sources.  Should we now
re-architect all of that as well?
