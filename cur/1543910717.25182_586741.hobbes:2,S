Thanks. If this doesn't give us any hint, it would be useful if you could 
do git-bisect between rc2 and rc3, I really can't immediately see anything 
in the list of commits that might directly cause the behavior you are 
seeing (most importantly because there were no USB and no HID updates in 
this window).
There are approximately 290 commits, so it shouldn't require more than 9 
reboots plus the time needed to check whether the bug triggers or not.
Thanks,
