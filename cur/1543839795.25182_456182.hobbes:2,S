I think a notifier is overkill, the top_cpuset mask should just be a
copy of cpu_possible_map, which doesn't change after boot so we don't
have to worry about keeping it in sync.  cpuset_cpus_allowed already
guarantees online cpus in the returned mask.

Agreed.
Here's a patch:
We have this code in sched_setaffinity:
	cpus_allowed = cpuset_cpus_allowed(p);
	cpus_and(new_mask, new_mask, cpus_allowed);
	retval = set_cpus_allowed(p, new_mask);
In the default case (the task belongs to the default toplevel cpuset),
cpuset_cpus_allowed always returns a copy of whatever cpu_online_map
was at boot.  When a new cpu is added to the system, the user is
unable to bind tasks to the new cpu -- in the code above we wind up
passing an empty cpumask to set_cpus_allowed and get -EINVAL.
Since cpuset_cpus_allowed already ensures that the cpumask it returns
reflects only online cpus, setting the default cpuset's cpus_allowed
mask to cpu_possible_map (which never changes) ensures correct
behavior.
