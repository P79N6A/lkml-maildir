I have one problem with the patchset, I cannot compile
the patches individually and some of the code is hard
to read as it depends on functions from future patches.
Patch 2, 3 and 4 fail to compile without patch 5 applied.
Patch 1 failed to apply with a reject in kernel/Makefile
I applied it on top of 2.6.20 with all of Paul Menage's
patches (all 7).
