Hi,
I've asked this question in several Newsgroups but nobody was really
able to answer it. That's why I decided to send it to LKM. Please CC
me on your replies. Thanks!
I've got a question related to ide performance.
First of all my hardware:
Mainboard: ASUS P4PE (using onboard IDE but not S-ATA)
   
http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket478/p4pe/overview.htm
Harddisk: Western Digital WD800JB
   
http://www.westerndigital.com/products/products.asp?DriveID=32
Now about the current performance (on 2.4.20 and almost the same on 2.5.56):
tom@storm:~$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.27 seconds =474.07 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.05 seconds = 20.98 MB/sec
The cache read time is pretty ok but the disk read time is below of
what I'd have expected. My expectations would have been around 40MB/sec.
Am I wrong with my expectations for this setup?
I'd really be interested in any suggestion about how I could omptimize
the system.
And here's some more information about the current settings (let me
know if you need anything else):
tom@storm:~$ sudo hdparm /dev/hda
