It used to be tiny (32 aligned bytes), then 2.6.22's quicklist enlarged
that to a whole (lowmem) page.  I think we were all too busy with other
stuff to protest loudly enough about that bloat.
If the quicklists are going, it'd be good for PAE to go back to a
kmem_cache of 32-byte entries as in 2.6.21 - I think Ingo's patch is
still using a whole page there.
Or have sl?b alignment changes, or virtualization issues (locking
per underlying struct page?), made a kmem_cache awkward there now?
