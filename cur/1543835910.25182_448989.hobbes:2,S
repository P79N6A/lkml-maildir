Subject: [PATCH] AVR32: Fix bug in __avr32_asr64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/1/197

libgcc uses a logical shift right instruction in one place we're
using an arithmetic shift right. I believe libgcc is right.
This fixes some weirdness in the timer code that I've seen lately.
