Hi Andrew!
Do you have any objections to merging FUSE in mainline kernel?
It's been in -mm for the 2.6.11 cycle, and the same code was released
a month ago as FUSE-2.2.  So it should have received a fair amount of
testing, with no problems found so far.
The one originally merged into -mm already addressed all major issues
that people found (most importantly the OOM deadlock thing), and
though there were some minor changes in the interface since then, I
feel that the current kernel interface will stand up to the test of
time.
Thanks,
Miklos
