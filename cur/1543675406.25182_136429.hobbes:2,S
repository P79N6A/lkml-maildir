cachetlb.txt also says "_OR_ the kernel is about to read from a page cache 
page..." and it's used like this in mm/filemap.c. I think it would be 
better to move this into a separate function, e.g. like this:
flush_user_dcache_page(): If the page is mapped writable into user space, 
flush the dirty data from the user D-cache, so it becomes visible from the 
kernel.
flush_kernel_dcache_page(): The page was written from kernel space and the 
data has to become visible in user space, so flush the data into memory 
and possibly invalidate data in the user D/I-cache. The flush can be 
delayed if this page is currently not mapped.
bye, Roman
