Can you remind us:
 - your ARM is UP, right? Do you have PREEMPT on?
 - This is probably a stupid question, but you did make sure that the 
   database was ok (with some rebuild command) and that you didn't have 
   preexisting corruption?
Anyway, the page_mkclean_one() fixes (along with _most_ things we've 
looked at) shouldn't matter on UP, at least certainly not without PREEMPT.
