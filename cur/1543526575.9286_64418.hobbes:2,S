It sounds to me like you want bootp support in the kernel because the
mkinitrd script is 
not easy to use.  Solvable problem, not necessarily a kernel problem
though...
I just sent a patch into Linus which fixes IP autoconfig, but Alan sez
"it has-got-to-go" (with elaboration) so I don't think your plea is
going to get farther than 2.4.x. :)
