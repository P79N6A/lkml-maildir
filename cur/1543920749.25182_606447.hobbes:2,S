Subject: [PATCH 0/9] RT: RT-Overload/Sched enhancements v4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/17/318

Applies to 23-rt1 + Steve's latest push_rt patch
Changes since v3:
1) Rebased to Steve's latest
2) Added a "highest_prio" feature to eliminate a race w.r.t. activating a task
   and the time it takes to actually reschedule the RQ.
3) Dropped the PI patch, because the highest_prio patch obsoletes it.
4) Few small tweaks
5) Few small fixes
Regards,
-Greg
