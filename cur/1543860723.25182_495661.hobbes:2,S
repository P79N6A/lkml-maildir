Yes, it's "silly" people people use configurations you find inconvenient.
At least one embedded x86 case cares, that I know of.  They only needed 
to make two minor changes to make it work.

Not /all/ the resources.  And YOU were the person harping me about 
acquiring all resources, so that even races no one cares about[1] are 
avoided.
But those two items were just from my five-minute, on-vacation review. 
Obvious bug #3:
The code no long reserves resources for the "extra" PCI BAR that often 
exists on PCI controllers regardless of legacy/native mode.  Previously, 
the code called pci_request_regions() to reserve ALL regions attached to 
the PCI device.
You have suddenly decided that it's OK to --not reserve at all-- these 
additional regions.
Proof:  The AHCI PCI BAR (#5, zero-based) is clearly NOT reserved, even 
though we talk to it, in piix_disable_ahci() of ata_piix.c.
