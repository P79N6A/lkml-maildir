Both use gcc 3.2.  The desktop pentium III is very old. Slow ram/bus may 
be the
reason. Or this may be the fastest a pentium iii 1 MHz can perform?.
Large RAM don't help pentium III. It doesn't need them here.
Large RAM should help Cursoe a lot. CMS should use those RAM as traslation
cache and put the entire processes (make, gcc, as) in it.
I guess 17.x min kernel compile time result from CMS still taking time 
interpreting x86
code (because it decide to do so to conserve translation cache space?).
I wish the linux kernel could hint CMS to do a better job, if possible, like
when to interpret, translate or fully optimize and save-to-disk for 
later use.
