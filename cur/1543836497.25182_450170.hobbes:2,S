I totally agree, Intel driver maintainers generally act like complete
idiots in these kinds of situations.
If the EEPROM has a broken checksum, the user should have an option
that allows him to try and use the device anyways, end of story.
It is only self serving to not provide this option to the user.
People make errors, EEPROM's get shipped with bad checksums but the
device might still be usable.  That is life get over it.
