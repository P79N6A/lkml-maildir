Hi All!
Just stumbled over it ...
ulimit -H -u <#procs>
refuses to go below the current 'soft' limit,
this was not the case in 2.4.21, but I do not
know when, how and why this changed ...
I do not have a problem with that, but it will
give some troubles on certain configurations,
which simply reduce the hard limit to something
reasonable and expect the soft limit to follow
best,
Herbert
