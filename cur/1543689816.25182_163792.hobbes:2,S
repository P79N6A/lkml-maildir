I think you're reading it as a "list_for_each(i, head1)" loop,
whereas it is and must be a "list_for_each_safe(i, next, head1)" loop.
So it won't (in general) terminate after this one requeueing (as
list_for_each would, finding i->next == head1): termination depends on
next (already set) and head1, so I repoint head1 to the first requeued.
So it should terminate after one pass down the list, when it reaches the
first requeued, and can then return the appropriate "ret" count to user.
You may perhaps know that the ret count is not important, but I don't
know that, so wanted to get it right.  (At the time, I also wanted to
have the list sorted exactly as intended, but now I can't see that the
relative positions of different keys could matter at all.)
It may be bad practice to use a familiar macro like list_for_each_safe,
yet play with its controlling variables within the loop.  I just felt
safer that way than expanding it, or adding extraneous variables.
