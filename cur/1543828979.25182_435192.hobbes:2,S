No, this memory is used to describe the tx ring from the host's
perspective.  The HW never touches this memory.  The HW's TX descriptor
ring is in adapter memory and is mapped into host memory (see
c2dev->mmio_txp_ring).

In this particular case, I believe this is done to avoid a swap of '0'
since its not necessary.  In other places, __raw is used because the
adapter needs the data in BE and we want to explicitly swap it using
cpu_to_be* then raw_write it to the adapter memory...

Um, what's a 'PCI posting flush'?  Can you point me where its
described/used so I can see if we need it?  Thanx.

The 1100 hardware caches the dma address of the next skb that will be
used to place data.  When the MTU changes, we want to free the SKBs in
the RX descriptor ring and get new ones that sufficient for the new MTU.
To effectively flush that cached address of the old skb, we must quiesce
the HW and firmware (via c2_down()), then reinitialize everything with
skb's big enough for the new mtu.
