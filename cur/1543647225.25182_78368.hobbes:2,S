I think that is a valid argument as long as it's called "driverfs" or
something, but since the thing is clearly evolving into a "kernelfs"  and
has drivers and devices as only a part of its structure knowledge, and is
used to expose various kernel hierarchies and relationships, I actually
think that it makes sense to expose the relationship of partitions to
devices.
(Not that it has to use "struct device" to do so, of course, although I 
don't see any major reason why it couldn't..)
What's the oops due to?
