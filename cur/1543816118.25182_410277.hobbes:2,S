I tried the patch below.  
It went to sleep fine.  It wouldn't wake up with the Fn key or
closing/opening the lid (both methods wake up Linux sleep).  But the
power switch did the trick, and it made it through most of the wakeup.
But the screen came back toofull of garbage and not taking keyboard
input (at least not to X), and it might have been stuck in PCI0._INI.
That was the last Execute Method on the serial console, and after that
line it was just printing dots one at a time: .......
So I had to power it down (by holding the power switch until it turned
off) and could never try the second sleep.
