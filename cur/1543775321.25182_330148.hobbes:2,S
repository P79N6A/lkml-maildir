It seems my patch was incomplete.
Thinking more about it, since it exists in all arches
and also since delaying is not performance critical
(hey, if we're going to delay/sleep, we surely can burn
a few more cycles), this can be done as follows:
linux/timer.c:
void ndelay(unsigned int nsecs)
{
	unsigned int m = nsecs/(1024*1024);
       	while (m--)
		__ndelay(1024);
	__ndelay(nsecs % (1024*1024));
}
void udelay(unsigned int usecs)
{
	unsigned int k = usecs/1024;
       	while (k--)
		__udelay(1024);
	__udelay(usecs % 1024);
}
void mdelay(unsigned int msecs)
{
       	while (msecs--)
		udelay(1000);
}
void ssleep(unsigned int secs)
{
        msleep(secs * 1000);
}
and arches will need to only supply two functions:
__udelay(n) [n is guaranteed <1024]
__ndelay(n) [n is guaranteed <1024*1024]
For users, _any_ value, however large, will work for
any delay function.
