It'll be roughly proportional to the number of processes, I guess: if we
have 100,000 processes (or threads) doing sleep(1000000) then yeah, it'll
take some time to wake them all up and capture them in refrigerator().
But I suspect a suitable fix for any problems which arise there is to
implement gang-offlining and onlining, rather than the present
one-cpu-at-a-time.  That'd be pretty simple to do: we already have sysfs
interfaces which take a cpumask.
