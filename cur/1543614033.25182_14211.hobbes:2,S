        Thanks. just gave it a try with -dj4, and it works fine. The eject 
button in xplaycd doesn't work anymore, but that's something the coder can 
look at. /usr/bin/eject works fine as well.
        When able, please apply this to the main tree, if it's not there 
already.
                                                        BL.
