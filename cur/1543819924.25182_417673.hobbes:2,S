Thanks for looking into this.  But we already know mdelay(2000) works
around it, and that the failure is "ata1: qc timeout (cmd 0xef)" when
trying to resume the SATA disk (in my case, don't know about Jeff's):
so I'm confused as to what binary search to be doing.  I just tried
backing out the time.c patch I sent originally, and substituting the
patch below, much closer to the heart of the problem: that works too.
This is with ata_piix, by the way; resuming from suspend to RAM.
Do let me know what else to try if you've got an idea.
