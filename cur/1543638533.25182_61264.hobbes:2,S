Yes, but that applies even to a transparent superpage scheme: in those
instances where an application knows what page size is optimal, it's
better if the application can express that (saves time
promoting/demoting pages needlessly).  It's not unlike madvise() or
the readahead() syscall: use reasonable policies for the ordinary
apps, and provide the means to let the smart apps tell the kernel
exactly what they need.
