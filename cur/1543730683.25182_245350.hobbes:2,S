The use of this would be to provide some access to crypto for portable 
programs which might be usefully run on systems which have not installed 
the big libs needed for usermode crypto. And it also addresses the 
reality that many people update their kernel more often than their libs, 
and new methods are more likely to be available there. For a low-volume 
task like encoding a key or other small chunk of data it might be that 
the overhead of the system call would be no more than the memory 
footprint of loading a lib to do a single operation.
And every time I see a new method in the kernel, I wonder why it's there 
is users can't access it?
Don't take this as a stand to include this, I'm just being devil's 
advocate and bringing up the benefits since multiple people are bringing 
up the drawbacks. If this was actually going to happen it *might* be 
done with a totally different interface and happen in a kernel thread or 
some such. One feature of MULTICS we don't have is the ability to 
execute kernel code in user mode, sort of like a shared library.
