I found out a couple of problems with IRQ rebalancing in that the
latency spread was effected by a ping-ponging of the actual interrupt
itself. I reported this to you in November and I fixed this problem
by gluing the interrupt to the same cpu as the irq-thread.
Not sure if it was the rebalancing or the cache issues, but they seem
related.
