 I assumed you had booted for a short time, suspended, resumed, and
then noticed the uptime was longer than time since resume.
 If you think there is a bug it might help to do a cold boot, at
some point note uptime and then immediately suspend, resume some time
later, immediately note uptime (including local time), keep it
running, and later monitor uptime against local time (i.e. the local
time will let you know the change you expect to see in uptime).  You
might also want to confirm that the local time is maintained
correctly.
