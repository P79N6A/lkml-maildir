it's more complex than that - MTRR's are caching attributes that the CPU
listens to. Mis-setting them can cause anything from memory corruption
to hard lockups. The question is, does any of the Intel (or AMD) docs
say that the CPU cache has to be write-back flushed when setting MTRRs,
or were those calls only done out of paranoia?
