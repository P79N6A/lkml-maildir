Ironically, we're currently trying to chase down a 'database benchmark'
regression that seems to have been cause by the last round of "let's
rewrite the scheduler again" (more details later). Nick, you've added an 
awful lot of complexity to some of these code paths yourself ... seems 
ironic that you're the one complaining about it ;-)

Because the zone is statically sized, and you're back to the same crap
we had with 32bit systems of splitting ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_HIGHMEM,
effectively. Define how much you need for system ram, and how much
for easily reclaimable memory at boot time. You can't - it doesn't work.
