If you consider any kind of patch tracking valuable, you should either 
do it yourself or write the tool yourself. In both cases, the 
interesting parts would be how to integrate it into the workflow of 
kernel development without creating extra work for anyone and how to get 
the information into the got commits.
"requires a real PRO" and "would probably involve" sound like cheap 
phrases for avoiding doing any work yourself.
Talk is cheap, but unless YOU will do it your emails will only be a 
waste of bandwidth.
