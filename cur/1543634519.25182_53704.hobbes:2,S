Is this LVM?
I don't see how LVM could produce such values.
(And in fact LVM does not even compile, so only a patched LVM
could produce anything at all.)

    I traced the change to the part of mainline ChangeSet 1.496 given
    below (warning: cut and pasted).  It seems to cause every possible
    device that a driver could provide to show up in /proc/partitions.
    For LVM, that's a zillion devices, and /proc/partitions overflows,
    showing some random pages from memory.  Reverting the patch below
    makes /proc/partitions and LVM happy again.

Yes.
Normally the nr_real field indicates how many devices are
present. But LVM sets that to 256 even when nothing is present.
So, indeed, when all size fields are set to 0 this would probably
yield a list of 256 absent LVM devices.
Maybe LVM has to be fixed, or this patch fragment reverted, or both.
Something else is that if /proc/partitions overflows that must be
fixed independently of zeros or LVM.
