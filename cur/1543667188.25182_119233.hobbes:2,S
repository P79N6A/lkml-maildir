On boot of 2.5.65-ac2, I got this (taken down by hand)
checking TSC synchronization across 2 CPUs:
divide error: 0000
CPU	0
[register stuff not transcribed]
Call Trace:
release_console_sem+0xa0
init+0x53
init+0x0
kernel_thread_help+0x5
I can write down the register stuff if needed.
I had previously booted with MORSE_PANICS enabled, and
the machine also either oopsed or panicked on boot.
I saw something about morse_panics in that trace, which was
very long, so I rebuilt -ac2 without MORSE_PANICS and got
the above.
The machine is dual PIII, kernel SMP, PREEMPT.
I can provide the .config if needed.
