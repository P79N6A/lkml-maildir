Hi.
Just wanted to chime and and say that my build of 2.6.21 + CFS-v6 + PI
patch by Thomas Gleixner has been running exceptionally well on my
single processor PII machine (Debian unstable) and my SMP PII machine
(Fedora Rawhide). On both systems no automatic 'renice'-ing happens,
and I've not noticed any performance issues on the Debian box while
in X. The Fedora machine currently runs X only occasionally as most of
the time I use it for building and testing various non-graphical
things.
