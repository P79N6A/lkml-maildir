Could you start up your brain now :) and think about the actual issue. All
the drivers must share the device resources and there is no (simple) way
to do so generically.
What you want to do is to write a single software driver, optionnaly
broken into several modules, that is aware of all the functionnalities of
the board and that will register to all involved sub-systems as needed.
