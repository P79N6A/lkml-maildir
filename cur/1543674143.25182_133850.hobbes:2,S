the static priority is the same for all tasks in the system unless you
use nice. I believe linux should do well without forcing the user to set
the GUI at high prio etc..

the dyn prio doesn't change the timeslice size, it only chooses if to
wakeup a task immediatly or not, timeslices are calculated in function
of the static priority, not the dyn prio. Those interactive tasks uses
nearly zero of their timeslice anyways, the size of the timeslice has
little meaning for interactive tasks, what matters is "when" they run
and that's controlled by the dyn prio.

if the static priority is much higher the immediate switch already
happens. But if we choose to guarantee a min_timeslice to tasks to avoid
the ctx switch flood for your testcase, then also the higher static prio
tasks will have to wait for this min_timeslice. The issue is no
different with higher static prio, or you will complain next time that
you get a ctx switch flood from a dd bs=1 writing into a pty connected
to an xterm running at -20 prio.
