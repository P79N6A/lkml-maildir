So care for him/her and don't wake him/her up ;)
Are you aware that - for DOS and Win9x - there is a similar project,
closed-source, but free for personal use, by the German Heise publishing
company?
It's called h2bench and available at 
ftp://ftp.heise.de/pub/ct/ctsi/,
comes with German, Dutch and English documentation.
Also, how does your software relate to ZCAV by Russell Coker?
