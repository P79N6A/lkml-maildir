For one thing, it means you can do :
obj-$(CONFIG_OPROFILE) += oprofile.o
oprofile-y                              := $(DRIVER_OBJS) init.o
timer_int.o
oprofile-$(CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC)       += nmi_int.o op_model_athlon.o \
                                           op_model_ppro.o op_model_p4.o
which is very nice. I don't know why they're installed like that though.
