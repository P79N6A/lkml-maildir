Subject: Compile problem with 2.4.4-pre6 (net_pcmcia.o not found in link)

If I configure PCMCIA out of the build, the build will not link,
because the linker is still looking for the net_pcmcia.o file.
If I say yes for PCMCIA and enable a single module, it works.
compile configuration available if someone would like to see it.
Thanks,
Ben
