What's wrong with just using bus_for_each_dev() instead?  You have to
supply a "match" type function anyway, so the caller doesn't have an
easier time using this function instead.
You also don't increment the reference properly when you return the
pointer, so you better document that... :(
In short, I don't think this is needed at all, as it's an almost
identical copy of bus_for_each_dev().

Same comment as above, I don't think this function is necessary.
