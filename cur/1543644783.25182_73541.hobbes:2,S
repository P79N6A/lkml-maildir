kallsyms/kksymoops existed for quite some time already, and there are a
couple of additional things it does:
 - it includes and uses the full symbol table, not just the module 
   symbols. (hence the 'all' in KALLSYMS)
 - as far as i can see your patch did not extend to show_stack()?
 - kksymoops prints a module list as well.
