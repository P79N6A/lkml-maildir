I don't know about CGL, but a unified async notification mechanism _is_ 
needed.  In ~2002, I needed one, and what I ended up with was a Red Hat 
2.4 kernel with IO_CMD_POLL hacked in.  Five years later, mainline still 
can't do that.
Whether it's syslets, threadlets, io_getevents with networking support, 
kevents, epoll with kaio support, queued signals, or something else, 
users don't care, but they need _something_.  Please don't ignore the 
users just because they quote the wrong text.  The need is very real.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
