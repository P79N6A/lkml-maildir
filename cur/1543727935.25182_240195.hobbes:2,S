Might be nicer to just put the locking inside of format_corename() if it
is the function itself that really needs the locking.  If another use of
it popped up, that user would get the locking for free and couldn't
possibly forget it.  Also, it's nicer to put the lock closer to the code
that actually needs it.  Untested patch to do that attached.
BTW, were you actually seeing a BKL contention problem, or was this just
for cleanliness?
