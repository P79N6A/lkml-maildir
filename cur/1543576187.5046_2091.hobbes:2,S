This is the case, but the important thing that David Schwartz said is that 
it does not rely on the time in a clock, but rather on the pretty much 
completely random skew between several independent clocks.  Any particular 
oscillator will vary in speed semi-randomly, and if you compare multiple 
clocks you can get pretty random numbers.
