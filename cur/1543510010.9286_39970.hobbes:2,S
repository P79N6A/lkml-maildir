Hello!
This is an Alpha AXPpci33 System. 2.3.18ac6 has several problems here:
1) final linkage fails because of missing strnlen_user in fs/exec.c:206.
   indeed there is no strnlen_user in arch/* except i386....
   I replaced the call with strlen_user and booted the resulting image:
2) serial console works only until the line
   Serial driver version 4.30 with MANY_PORTS MULTIPORT SHARE_IRQ SERIAL_PCI PCI_IOMEM enabled
   is displayed. only the vga-console shows the following messages.
   With 2.3.10 this works OK.
3) The ISDN driver 
   3a) doesn't receive irq's 
   3b) panics when it's giving up initialisation
   with 2.3.10 this is also OK.
   I've already mailed this to the ISDN maintainer.
   I disabled isdn support:
4) Now the kernel boots and I finally can login, also on the serial console.
   But tere are more problems: 
   setserial segfaults (IIRC on all 14 ports).
   loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz
   immediately locks up the system. Only SysRq works. It shows several 
   processes in 'R'unning state. No Sync, no unmount. 
   At this state the serial console _is_ receiving characters but it's 
   dropping most of them. One can only read small pieces of the much longer
   SysRq output.
   I'm not shure whether it's pure incidence but I once booted without calling
   loadkeys and played a bit with midnight commander and suddenly (about 2 
   minutes after boot) the same lockup occurred.
What can I do to find out what's going on here?
Bye,
Thorsten
