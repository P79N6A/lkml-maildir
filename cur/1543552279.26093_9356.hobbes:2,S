"Bugs" in the kernel are related with things like supposing that the compilers 
makes things (such as alignment or padding in structs) in certain way, that 
could be done in any other way, but are done 'that' way in gcc.

I am now compiling my 2.2.18-pre kernels with gcc-2.95 and work fine. It is
2.96 what is broken.

That should not be done that way. A 2.2.17 kernel is a 2.2.17. If you want
AGP, or USB, build a kernel and name it 2.2.18-pre17 and offer it in your
distro with that name. So users can know they are installing 2.2.18-pre, and
not 2.2.17.
