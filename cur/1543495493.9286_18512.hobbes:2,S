It seems to me that we are allowing it also on not VM_SHARED or a file
opened without O_RDWR:
[..]
int generic_file_mmap(struct file * file, struct vm_area_struct * vma)
{
        struct vm_operations_struct * ops;
        struct inode *inode = file->f_dentry->d_inode;
        if ((vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED) && (vma->vm_flags & VM_MAYWRITE))
{
                ops = &file_shared_mmap;
                /* share_page() can only guarantee proper page sharing if
                 * the offsets are all page aligned. */
                if (vma->vm_offset & (PAGE_SIZE - 1))
		    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ here OK
                        return -EINVAL;
        } else {
                ops = &file_private_mmap;
                if (inode->i_op && inode->i_op->bmap &&
                    (vma->vm_offset & (inode->i_sb->s_blocksize - 1)))
		     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ but here?
                        return -EINVAL;
        }
[..]
Probably I am missing something in the whole picture...

This make sense. Even if I think the natural is to allow alignment as far
as the bmap/readpage level can handle them.

Ok.

Really as I stated in my previous email I think that the executable case
is not a big issue for making sure that everybody uses the same physiscal
page. My point is that nobody run `cp executable /dev/null` while running
`executable'.
