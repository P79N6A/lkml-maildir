Yes, the arm code is nice.  But the Zarus uses the code from Lineo,
which I have merged into the main tree at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/usbd-2.5
I really want to merge the arm and Lineo code together, so people don't
have to maintain two different trees which work on the same devices,
doing much the same thing.  That's the goal at least :)
The code also needs some serious cleanups, which is why I am asking for
help from people with one of these devices.
thanks,
