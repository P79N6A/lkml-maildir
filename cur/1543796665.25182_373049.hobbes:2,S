security@kernel.org works that way already in a way. Of course it'd be
nice to add a cve name while coding the security hole into the kernel,
but nobody is that clearvoyant ;) The hardest part is actually knowing
which versions are affected, especially when the code no longer quite is
the same, the locking rules got cleaned up in later versions (which
means the older kernel was a mess, so you're always looking at more
messy code than the "new" kernel). For some stuff this is easy. For
other stuff it for sure isn't, especially if you want to keep api/abi
compatibility, or at least low impact. Some security fixes just are
invasive. Those are rare, maybe 2 or 3 times a year or so. But they do
exist... unfortunate as it is. The irony is that doing a "hacky" less
invasive risk actually may introduce more risk to stability than doing
the full invasive fix. Nasty trade-offs there....
