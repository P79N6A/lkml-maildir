That all looks normal.  Could you be more specific about
the performance problems?  How much slower? Output from
`top' and `ps'?  Any nasty messages in the system log?
Looking at the ethernet driver won't help, I expect - it's
as efficient as most any other driver.  If there is a problem,
it lies elsewhere...
A kernel profile would be illuminating.  Build the kernel with as few
modules as possible, boot the machine with `profile=1' and play
with readprofile.
