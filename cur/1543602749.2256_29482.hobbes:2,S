Moving clear_bit just above submit_bh will fix it (please Robert make
this change before testing it), because if we block in submit_bh in the
bounce, then we won't deadlock on ourself because of the pagehighmem
check, and all previous non-pending bh are ok too, (only the next are
problematic, and they're still marked pending_IO so we can't deadlock on
them).
So you can re-consider my approch, the design of the fix was ok, it was
just a silly implementation error.
