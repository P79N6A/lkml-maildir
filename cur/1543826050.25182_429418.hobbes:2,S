 Yeah, it will be a lot of work to port all the USB-Serial drivers to the
new interface. We have to discuss if it really pays off.
 IMHO, yes, it does. Currently, USB-Serial is duplicating code and solutions
from the Serial Core implementation. From the kernel POV, we're maintaining
two interfaces to solve (almost) the same problem.
 Killing one of the interfaces would make people concetrate in only one
of them.

 But I wonder why I couldn't just use the Serial Core's spinlock for
that.

 Hmmmm. I'll have to buy a new simcard for that (I can't use GPRS with the
one I have), then it will have to wait some days.
 Would be good to get some help here. :)

 Good point.
 In my first version of the port, I added additional code to handle
the multi-port thing. When it worked, I realized that that code wasn't
necessary: just registering each port with the Serial Core seems
enough.
 Then yes, I think we can do it.
 Will think more about that and try a new version in the weekend.
 Well, for some reason the patchset e-mails didn't reach LKML.
That's strange, because our replies are going there.
 Either, git-send-email has a bug or I did something wrong.
 Anyways, I just uploaded the patchset to:
