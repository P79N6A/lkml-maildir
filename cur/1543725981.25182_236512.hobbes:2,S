You can't prove anything by a single found watermark, but you can encode
additional information by placing the watermarks at chosen offsets in your
file.
For example, take prime numbers starting at 2 as offsets, and place the
encodings in a chosen order at those offsets.
The chances for a random occurence of this pattern are marginal, and -
unless the watermarked file becomes strongly fragmented - this pattern is
easy to retrieve.
While this might not be evidence in the legal sense (it could well be, but
IANAL), it is at the very least a strong indication.
