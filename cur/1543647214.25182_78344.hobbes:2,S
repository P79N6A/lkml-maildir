Huh?
Without reading the kernel routing table code a bit more,  I'm not certain
what that change does,  but it looks as if it might be changing the
connected route for a link local from fe80::/10 to fe80::/64.
I'd actually say that is wrong.
All link local's are currently supposed to have those top bits
('tween 10 and 64) zero'd,  however any address within the link local
prefix _is_ on link / connected and should go to the interface.
i.e. it's perfectly valid for me to assign a link local of fe80:1910::10
     to an interface and expect it to be work,  likewise for a packet
     destined to any link local address to trigger ND.
