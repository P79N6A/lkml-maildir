| Hello:
|
| I am running 2.2.9 on a Gateway GP6-300 which is a P2 box with the PIIX4 IDE
| chipset. It has performed faithfully with IDE/UDMA drives on 2.0, 2.1 and now
| 2.2 kernels. I've used the Matrox FBCON without trouble, various
| modems, and an  NE2K ethernet card.
|
| I purchased an Adaptec AHA-2940UW Pro card, built the appropriate SCSI driver
| into the kernel, and installed a new HD and CDROM. Everything runs swimmingly
| on bootup until Linux itself starts.
|
| The SCSI interface is not recognized by the kernel on bootup (I get scsi: 0
| hosts), and scanning /proc/pci shows that it is seen as an "Adaptec unknown
| device".
|
| I don't know what to blame here; my motherboard's BIOS, the Adaptec
| SCSI bios,
| the kernel's aic7xxx driver, or gremlins. However, the AHA-2940UW "Pro" is an
| odd card; it's a 2940UW that is supposed to be able to handle all three
| connectors at once, and I can't find documentation on the cursed thing
| anywhere, least of all from Adaptec.
|
| If there is a known linux fix for this such as a kernel parameter, a tweak to
| the driver, or a goat to sacrifice, I'd very much appreciate hearing
| about it.  A hug would be nice too. ;-)
Sorry, but I don't have a solution to your problem. I do have a
suggestion though. You're likely to get a better response to your
question by posting it to the aic7xxx mailing list. It's a small
volume mailing list dedicated to the aic7xxx Linux driver. The
instructions for subscribing are:
  To Subscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org 
  with "subscribe aic7xxx" in the body of the message 
Good Luck,
Gary
