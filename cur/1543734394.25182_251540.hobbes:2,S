right now we might have a periodic timer interrupt, but for the sake of
powersaving (and for virtualization) we want to try variable rate timer
interrupts real soon, which would remove any sort of determinism from
the mwait() loop. So we cannot take this approach unless CPU makers
guarantee the behavior. Right now it's inherently fragile.
Besides, even a 1msec upper cap on spinlock-wait times is totally
unacceptable from a latency and quality of implementation point of view.
