Hey,
Is there any movement in the kernel world to "pickle" process, i.e.
completely move a process and all associated kernel resources to disc. 
At a later time the process could be "brought back to life" on a
DIFFERENT machine.  The idea would be to move processes around between a
cluster of machines, possiblly storing a process for months or years
before waking it up again.
Has this been a discussed before?  Is it even possible?  Seems very
useful.
Please respond to my email address as I'm not a regular subscriber of
this list.
Cheers,
Curt
