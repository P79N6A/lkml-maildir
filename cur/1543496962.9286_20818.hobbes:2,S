Subject: corruption of ext2 loopback mounted encrypted filesystems.

I'm seeing corruption of filesystems, encrypted, with idea, on kernel
2.2.5, with the kerneli patch applied, and e2compr (though I am not using
e2compr on the affected filesystems) 
Apm, as it's a laptop.
Config is below.
Symptoms: mounts ok initially, though with errors,
when e2fsck is run over them, they explode in a messy heap.
I'm trying to narrow down the circumstances, though have
not succeeded so far.
I believe I'm always unmounting them cleanly.
On a side note, is there a clean way to sync any blocks that
are due to go to an encrypted device, take away the encrypted
device, and have any requests block, until the encrypted device
is put back.
Basically, laptop recieves "lid's closing, suspend", then removes the
password to the loopback device, suspends to disk, and on awaken,
switches to an unused VT, and asks for a password, if not given,
every time a blocking I/O happens, it switches back to the 
password VT.
Thoughts?
