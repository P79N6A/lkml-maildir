Uh no, reverting it will just re-introduce bugs that it fixed.
2.4.22-pre should have come around a long time ago. The only reason most
of the changes in 2.4.21-pre for ieee1394 are there is because of the
amount of time that 2.4.21-pre has been sitting around. I was trying to
hold off most of these changes for 2.4.22-pre, but .21-pre lingered for
so long it became unreasonable.
Then after a long huge pause, it suddenly goes -rc. Should that leave me
stuck? Don't think so.
