This is a pretty minor nitpick...
hardware: ibm thinkpad t21 using the apm driver
With 2.4.5-ac13, unplugging from AC, reconnecting to AC no longer causes
sound to be scratchy/garbled, but if something already has /dev/sound/dsp
open and AC state changes, the sound is garbled until the program reopens
the device (usually requires restarting the program e.g. mpg123).
At last, though, i don't have to rmmod and insmod.  That at least is a
relief.
