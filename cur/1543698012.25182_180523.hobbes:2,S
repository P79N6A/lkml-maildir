While booting 2.6.0-t11 into textmode I found out there are still some
problems with the keyboard code.
On my laptop with PS/2 keyboard (Japanese layout) I can't use the key
with the Yen on it (which also has the pipe). All other keys seem to
work OK.
On my PC with USB keyboard (Logitech iTouch) I can't use the "\" key
properly so I can't type "ps -ef | grep blabla" which is not very
helpful is you want to try to investigate problems.
So there seems to be some kind of anti-pipe conspiracy here...;-)
