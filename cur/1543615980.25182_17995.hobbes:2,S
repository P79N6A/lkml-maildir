One of the ideas that I've kicked around with some people here and the
ACPI guys is the notion of trigger device enumeration from userspace
completely.
During the initramfs stage, a program (say devmgr) figures out what type
of system you have, where the PCI buses are, etc. It tells the kernel this
information, which then probes for existence, then loads drivers.
There of course needs to be a fallback mechanism for cases where the
hardware isn't known about, the tables are buggy, or you need to do
things like make bios32 calls. But, that can be triggered via a procfs
file, a system call, etc.
But, this all fits nicely with the notion of parsing firmware tables from
userspace, be them DMI, MPS, or ACPI tables. How they're read is
unimportant (/dev/mem or /var/run/*), it's just that the logic to do so
can be moved out of the kernel and consolidated.
