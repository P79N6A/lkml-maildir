Ok, I just committed a rough first cut at fixing up arm/.
I don't have a cross-build environment, and am too lazy to set one up, but 
that should likely fix 99% of the issues, and any missing things should be 
fairly obvious from the compiler warnings and errors that are bound to 
remain.
Somebody with an arm environment, please test and send in any remaining 
missing parts, and we'll get it all sorted out long before rmk comes back 
from holidays ;)
