You may want to consider Mel's antifrag approaches which certainly 
decreases the chance of this occurring. Reclaim can open up the needed 
linear memory hole in a intentional way. The memory compaction approach 
can even move pages to open up these 2M holes. The more pages we make 
movable (see f.e. the targeted slab reclaim patchset that makes slab 
pages movable) the more reliable higher order allocations become.
