So a quick update on what I am seeing.
I have now tried with a myriad of driver and kernel versions watching very
carefully for a pattern.
What I have observed is memory corruption in what looks like it may
be a confined area of memory.  The ECC SDRAM is being closely
monitored and I am not getting as much as a correctable error much
less and uncorrectable error that would show up so memory is ruled
out.  When I am connected to a particular Extreme Networks gigabit
switch.  (The switch has some problems and it is hypothesized the
switch is injecting problematic packets into the network).
Bad packets should not be a problem but it looks like they are
triggering the problem whatever it is.
