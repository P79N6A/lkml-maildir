I've not made major changes since the last patch post, just some small
optimizations and fixes - I've been too tied up with other stuff.
Whilst I've got no objection in general to using nsproxy rather than
the container_group object that I introduced in my latest patches, I
think that Vatsa's approach of losing the general container object is
flawed, since it loses any kind of per-group generic state (e.g. "this
container is being deleted") and last time I saw it, I think it would
tend to lose processes so that they didn't show up in any directory in
the container fs.
