  Yes. Some of the sysrq are considered insecure - for example OOM
kill, which was added lately, can be used to kill some process and I
could imagine security implications from cleverly killing syslogd (or
some other important process) by it. OTOH some other functionalities
are useful and safe...

  And that is exactly what the patch does ;).
