My scripts generated patches that were duplicates due to either something in my
scripts that messed up, or due to some way that the git commands changed from
the last time I checked.  Odds are it's my fault.  So it counted
everything twice.  Let me go generate the patches again...
Ok, here's what I get:
 drivers/block/ub.c                      |    4 -
 drivers/pci/hotplug/cpci_hotplug_core.c |    2 
 drivers/pci/hotplug/cpci_hotplug_pci.c  |    5 +
 drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c           |  118 ++++++++++++++++++++++++--------
 4 files changed, 99 insertions(+), 30 deletions(-)
So your merge is correct.  Thanks for verifying.
