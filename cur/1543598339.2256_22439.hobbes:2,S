Downloading now, will try this afternoon and let you know. 
Another person mentioned that there might be an irq routing problem, 
and using 'noapic' might fix the problem also. The machine has two 
ioapics, and it is possible to disable one through the bios setup. I 
have noticed that interrupt routeing is quite different with both 
ioapics enabled than with just one. 
Is there any benefit to enableing both, and will enableing just one 
fix the issue?
