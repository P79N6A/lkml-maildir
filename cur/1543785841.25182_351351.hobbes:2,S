Subject: "Failed to acquire semaphore" with ACPI since 2.6.10-rc2

I've been sticking with 2.6.9 for a while. Since 2.6.10-rc2, when ACPI is
enabled, I spontaneously (I don't know how to provoke them) get lots of these
messages:
osl-0940 [1279] os_wait_semaphore     : Failed to acquire
semaphore[00000100018befa0|1|0], AE_TIME
osl-0940 [1292] os_wait_semaphore     : Failed to acquire
semaphore[00000100018befa0|1|0], AE_TIME
...
Same problem in 2.6.14-rc1. With acpi=off, there's no problem. In
2.6.10-r1, with or without ACPI, no problem.
I have an nForce 3 mainboard in an Asus laptop, arch is x86_64, and all
kernels are vanilla and without proprietary nvidia in the tests.
Please CC my personal address.
Thanks,
Havard
