Yeep. And now please take the next step and grep for "jiffies + 1"
to realize that a timeout primitive along the following
take_a_nap(temeout_function, timeout_data);
would help simpify the usage of timers and speed up the kernel
due to cache locality for stuff which is added to the global
timer list just for doing short micro-polls and beeing taken
out ther on the next scheduler round. In esp. nearly every
single eth driver out there shows precisely what I mean.
Becouse most of the timers get only added for one jiffie!
