For try_to_free_pages, shrink_zones will continue to be called until
priority reaches 0. So temp_priority and prev_priority are now 0. When
it breaks out of the loop, prev_priority gets assigned temp_priority.
Both of which are zero *unless you've hit the temp_priority race*. As
I said, getting rid of temp_priority and somehow tracking it locally
will close this race. I agree this race is a bug and would be happy to
see it fixed. This might be what your patch inadvertently fixes.

OK it is an improvement for the cases when we hit priority = 0. It would
be nice to fix the race for medium priorities as well though. Hmm, OK,
if we can't do that easily then I would be OK with this approach for the
time being.
Please don't duplicate that whole loop again in try_to_free_pages, though.

No. If we've walked the whole bloody list and failed to reclaim any
pages, we do not set prev_priority to DEF_PRIORITY. Read the code, it
does the same thing with the priorities as shrink_zones.

AFAIKS there is no bug that have identified here or in your changelog.
There is a race, there are many of tolerable races in reclaim. I can
accept this races is intolerable for you, so I am OK with fixing it.

No problem, I didn't ask you to do that. But if you want this patch
in the upstream kerenl, then I will keep asking whether it fixes a
problem in the upstream kernel.

I can't see any besides the temp_priority race.
