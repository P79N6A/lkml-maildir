When using 2.3.30's internal isapnp, my AWE64 doens't work anymore.  I
used all the same settings I was using in .29 [0x220.irq5,dma1,etc].  The
joystick port isn't detected either.  The kernel logs just display
"Starting sound init." and then "Sound init. finished." with nothing
between them.  The joystick driver reports that no joysticks were found.  
My system for setting up this card is compile sound support into the
kernel and have the kernel isapnp init it before the sound code is
activated.  So far it has worked in all dev kernels up to this one (.30).
The only thing that my inexpirenced eyes can see that would cause this
change are the updates to the isapnp code and the sb_card code.
