I think I should really add somewhere a comment for this issue.
This field is not used in practice in linux kernel (neither in 32 or
64 bit), but should have some value, since a CAPI message trace will
display it.
The correct value in the 32 bit case is the address of the
data, in 64 bit it makes no sense, maybe we should use 0 here.
