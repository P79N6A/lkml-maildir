Please stop this kind of trolling, you did not remove anything here,
so do not claim to remove things....
As you don't seem to know the nettiquette:
If you believe you have some kind of problems that was used by the
OP to send a personal attack, the natural reaction is to send a
personal mail that does _not_ include a list of persons or a mailing
list.
As it does not seem to make sens to continue here, I will not reply to any 
further mail that tries to discuss something from the "mail threading"
attack.
