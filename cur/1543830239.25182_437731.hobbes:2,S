Ok. Sorry for my wonky memory then :)

Yes, I'm always feeding it PAGE_SIZE chunks and compressing each page 
separately. It's a long time since I looked at or thought about this, so I'll 
spend some more time getting it fresh in my head if you like.

I just left Marc's original code as it was, so I'm not completely sure, but I 
guess it's because we want lowmem.

Page_buffer is the destination buffer passed to the compressor. Local buffer 
is used to buffer the output for writing (and vv).

Is that from our previous correspondence? I can't find anything like it now.
