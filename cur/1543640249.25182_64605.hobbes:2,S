Sigh...  What we need with IDE is
	a) translator/bogon filter between hardware folks and the rest of
us.  If Jens or Alan are willing to do that for a while - wonderful.
	b) review of code structure in existing code.  Doing that.
	c) careful massage (as opposed to grand rewrite) of said structure
into something sane.  With series of small provable equivalent transformations.
And whoever does that is in serious risk of burnout - current spaghetty in
there is a fscking mess.  I'll try to help with that - I know how to do such
work, but I don't promise to get it all the way to sanity.
When we will have sane structure and sane interfaces, the life will get easier.
Until then full-time maintainership of drivers/ide/* is a one-way ticket to
Bedlam.
