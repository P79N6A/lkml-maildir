Bingo !!! 
This raised performance from 270 rps to 802 rps when 64 clients were
pulling a 4k HTML-page. Single CPU perfomance lies by 890 rps -- but the
new numbers are just from a very short run. (BTW: NT/IIS on 4 CPUs
deliver 840 rps :-)
Or with apaches ab:
ab -c 8 -t 120 127.0.0.1/4k.html
produces:
2.2.8 4 CPUs:                350.95 
2.2.8 4 CPUs with patch:    1334.19
2.2.8 no SMP:               1540.22
BTW: I'm going to release my test program under GPL after I cleaned it
up a little. ab is not working for me, because it dies with "broken
pipe" when I try it over the network -- perhaps because they are doing
non-blocking I/O...

I'd like to here some comments from other people on this. Is this a
proper patch or is it dangerous in any way ?
Linus, Alan, would you recommend to run a machine with that patch ?

My intention is not to publish benchmark results and let others explain
them. I want to understand, what I'm measuring and why. For this, your
suggestion is excellent. 
If I can even present a patch, that might help people, it's a lot better
than shouting out the latest "records".

Thanks for the open statement.

Yes, please send me patch. I'll try the other way, too.

Will it come into 2.2 or 2.3 only ?
Thanks for your help, juergen
