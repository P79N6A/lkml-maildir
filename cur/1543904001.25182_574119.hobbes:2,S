Just a wild thought: could the actual problem be with accessing the
initrd? After all, everything that's failing is based on modules
which are stuffed there. But I know far too less about initrd to
pursue this thought further.

Yes, of course. Sorry, I thought I'd mentioned that. It shows the
standard behaviour of a Suse that cannot mount its root filesystem:
first a message: "waiting for /dev/system/root to appear" followed
by a series of dots, and then fallback into a standalone /bin/sh.
