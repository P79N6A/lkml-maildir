Its pretty close to correct. If the RT tasks need the O/S services to
perform they're rt function, as oppossed to your logging scenario where
the logging passive and doesn't feed data back into the rt system, then
they inherit the determinism of the *least* deterministic part of the
system. If you're running an 200Hz controller that expects setpoints
via a udp connection at 40 Hz, and is loggin large amounts of data, you're
"real time" controller is going to be affected by the non real-time
nature of the user-space activities. This is not good. Note that the
disk logging and the gui displaying progress charts, and the tcp are all
logically disconnected systems, the only necessary shared resources are
CPU time, and irqs, so they shouldn't have to affect each other, but they
are too closely coupled under Linux right now.
