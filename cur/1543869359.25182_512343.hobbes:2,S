This code is really tricky. There are now three functions (cio_tpi,
sclp_sync_wait and __udelay) where we use a local_bh_disable()
_local_bh_enable() pair while we are disabled for interrupts. cio_tpi
and sclp_sync_wait are used to wait for the interrupt of the console
device to make room in the buffer for a printk out of disabled context.
__udelay() is used in the ETR clock-synchronization code where we are
disabled as well and the only alternative would be looping on a STCK for
about a second.
So basically we want to synchronously receive a specific interrupt. All
other interrupt sources are disabled. We know that the interrupt we wait
for will not cause a softirq to get scheduled. In case of sclp_sync_wait
and __udelay the interrupt is delivered the usual way by using the
asynchronous interrupt handler (I told you it is tricky ;-). That works
as long as only the hardirq part of the interrupt is executed, the
softirq part may not happen -> local_bh_disable. Back in the function
after the interrupt we cannot allow the softirq to happen when we
reenable the bottom-halves since the functions are called disabled and
need to stay disabled -> _local_bh_enable. Since the interrupt we waited
for did not add a softirq no harms is done, no?
