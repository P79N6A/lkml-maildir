Thanks for your reply.
That make sense. But at least ext3 needs to know when all data has
been flushed so that it can commit the meta data. Question is how can
ext3 knows that? The data flushing is done by flush daemon. There go
to be some way to notify ext3 that data is flushed. Where  is this
part of code in ext3 module?
