Sorry if I quote myself again , but I think to have understood why my system
hangup at installation .
The default IRQ that my motherboard sets for USB 2.0 controller and the
Sound Card is "12" if no PS/2 mouse is plugged-in (generally IRQ12 is
reserved to PS/2 mouse) , but the PS/2 Mouse port is always present , also
if no mouse is plugged-in , and the linux PS/2 mouse driver occupies the IRQ
12 when loads , so , when it's the time of the USB 2.0 controller driver the
booting hangs up.
Is not possible adding a feature in  the kernel , that if the PS/2 driver
doesn't find any mouse plugged in the port just leve free the IRQ12 instead
of catching it up? (if this feature is not already implemented , but it is
doesn't work for me)
