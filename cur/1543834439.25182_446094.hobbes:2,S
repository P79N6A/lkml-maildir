Following three patches introduce support for color themes in
menuconfig.
First patch is a refactoring of the color support in lxdialog, and the
next two introduces two new color schemes: blackbg and bluetitle.
The latter should be well know to -mm users.
To use a color theme:
make MENUCONFIG_COLOR=blackbg menuconfig
Avalable themes:
blackbg, mono, bluetitle
