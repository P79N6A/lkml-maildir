Pavel, I tried with your .config, and indeed the system came back to life after
2-3 minutes after I press Fn/F4, indeed the issue seems to be with the disk.
It could be that the same takes place with my original .config - maybe
I just wasn't patient enough. I'll need to re-test that.
However, I noticed that, after resume, when the system is presumably functional,
if I try to suspend to ram again, this second suspend hangs, displaying
the following on screen:
[   17.170000] ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:00.0[A] -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 20
[   17.170000] PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:02:00.0 to 64
[   17.250000] e1000: 0000:02:00.0: e1000_probe: (PCI Express:2.5Gb/s:Width x1) 00:16:41:5
4:6c:47
[   17.330000] e1000: eth0: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
the crescent LED starts blinking and does not seem to stop for at lest 10 min,
I've run out of patience after that. It could be that it's just very slow again.
Pavel, did you try suspend to RAM after a successfull resume from RAM?
Under 2.6.20, the system suspends/resumes to memory within about 20 sec
any number of times.
