If you want the changes present in pre10 _and_ xfs _and_ LVM,
get the -aa kernel. Version pre10-aa2 has xfs included.
You can get the original at
http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.19pre10aa2.gz
http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.19pre10aa2/
Or a copy at:
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/kernel/2.4.19-pre10-jam2/00-aa-pre10aa2.bz2
I talk about the copy because in the same location you also have Andre's
ide-convert.10 IDE update patch:
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/kernel/2.4.19-pre10-jam2/40-ide-10.bz2
You can try with those patches to see if this gives any help (note: IDE's patch
is not the original, it has been edited to merge with -aa, so I can have made
a mistake -- if it works someone could give it a thorough test, I have not
the hardware...)
