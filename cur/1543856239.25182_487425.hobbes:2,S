I know the difference between APIC and IO-APIC :)
Thing is, the function right above the one I added was this:
static int __init parse_noapic(char *arg)
{
        /* disable IO-APIC */
        disable_ioapic_setup();
        return 0;
}
early_param("noapic", parse_noapic);
So while "ioapic" might make more sense, it's doesn't match the opposing
command line option of "noapic".
I could include this in the diff:
+/* "noapic" is for backward compatibility */
 early_param("noapic", parse_noapic);
+early_param("noioapic", parse_noapic);
And then add the "ioapic" option.
