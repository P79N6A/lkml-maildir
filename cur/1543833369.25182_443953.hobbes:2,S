It prints this bit for a reason
MCE almost always occurs because your processor detected an internal
inconsistency, in this case a parity error. So you almost certainly have
a real hardware problem.
Fixing it tends to depend on the system. With bigger servers you usually
find that the MCE info produces the correct response because the server
people actually understand use and care about MCEs even in other-os.
For random cheap desktop PC systems it can be more fun, reporting an MCE
is as likely to cause them to send you a new monitor as any other part
