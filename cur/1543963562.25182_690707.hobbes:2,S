The normal expectation is that all allocations are made using
vmemmap_alloc_block() which allocates from the appropriate place.  Once
the buddy is up and available it uses:
	struct page *page = alloc_pages_node(node,
			GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO, get_order(size));
to get the memory so it should all be zero'd.  So I would expect all
existing users to be covered by that?  Can you not simply use __GFP_ZERO
for your allocations or use vmemmap_alloc_block() ?
