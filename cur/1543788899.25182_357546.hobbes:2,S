Hi Ingo, just a heads up, I'm still seeing the same problems I reported
with rt13. After about 10 to 15 minutes of up time I see the usual
warnings from Jack, keyboard repeat problems (repeats keys too fast) and
random screensaver triggers. The last two seem to be "clustered" in
time, for a little while things work, then both happen and so on and so
forth. 
Sorry to not have any traces that could help, I'm still too busy to be
able to sit down quietly and gather data.
