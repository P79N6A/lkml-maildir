In the quite unlikely situation where that happens, you've obviously
got a piece of software which is broken dependency-wise.  Many of the
current schemes will fail to accommodate that too.
For example, no amount of moving the /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K35smb script
around will fix that situation on Red Hat.
A solution to your example is to fix two of the three broken pieces of
software by splitting B into B1 and B2, and either A or C into their
components likewise:
A1 --> B1 --> C --> B2 --> A2
 -or-
C1 --> B1 --> A --> B2 --> C2

Your example did in no way prove that, so thus far that statement is not true.

And my next posting was about ext3 again.
