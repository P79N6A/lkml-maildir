It is already in use by the F_SETSIG FASYNC code in 2.3.  Worse, the
"_fd" member which follows it is also in use, even on 2.2.  
si_band isn't in use in 2.2 to my knowledge, so we could conceivably
move it after the si_fd member and replace the old si_band with padding,
but is this really any better than leaving si_band as an int?
