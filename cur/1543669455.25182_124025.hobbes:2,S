 Most ATA-RAIDs disable write-caching, and that's not really a performance
-disadvantage with a decent drive-scheduler (afaik most OSes implement a
cyclical-scan and not elevator-schedulers) when the HD has a linear mapping;
and today's ATA-HDs all have linear mappings. Only with back-to-back writes
can cause the HD to have a lap of honour.
