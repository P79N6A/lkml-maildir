  A year or two ago I had a peek after I got reports that it
  didn't work together with ZMailer -- turned out that some
  baseline PYTHON library for SMTP does something stupid in
  its protocol line construction..  The system experiencing
  problems was running ZMailer with ultra-strict RFC 821
  (plus amendaments) mode.
  Ergo, the MAILMAN might be ok, but underneath it there may
  be buggy language library..  (may STILL be, that is.)
  Another point, DaveM, was that MAILMAN is written in Python,
  and neither of us "speaks" that language...

  Oh dear me.  It is feeding those one message at a time with least
  possible resource usage...  Perhaps it can be made less "vicious"
  with e.g. sprinkling sleep(1) calls all over the code, but I would
  rather not do such a gross thing..
