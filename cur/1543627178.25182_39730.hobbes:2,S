OK, thanks Robert will try without it after some sleep.
But preemption without lock-break on 2.4 is like running without preemption.
The general latency problem with O(1) for 2.4 still stands.
Do you have similar observations with the current -ac tree?
You should have my numbers.
I only would bring your focus somewhat back to 2.4 'cause 2.6 is so far...
Thanks,
