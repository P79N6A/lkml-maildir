Subject: [PATCH] USB: Only enable autosuspend by default on certain device classes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

We're seeing a large number of problems with devices not appreciating 
USB autosuspend, especially printers and scanners. According to 
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/bus/USB/USBFAQ_intro.mspx
 only a 
subset of drivers support it in Windows XP, meaning that most devices 
are probably untested in this situation. This patch alters the behaviour 
to match that of Windows. Userspace can still whitelist devices as 
appropriate, and the set of classes supporting autosuspend probably 
covers pretty much every driver likely to be found on any portable 
device.
