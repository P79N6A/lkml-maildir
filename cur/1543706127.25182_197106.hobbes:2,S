Yes that is how I read the Athlon data sheet. It also needs the disconnect bit
set in the Northbridge.

Great Idea and I think well worth trying but...
I just tried booting with "idle=poll" and without my apic_tack arg
which to my understanding should avoid using the hlt instruction. I know
my system has the disconnect bit set by the bios.
I was just writing you to tell you how well it prevented lockups when my system
experienced a hard lockup in a slightly different form. Firstly mplayer bailed
complaining about misuse of cpu ram etc, which is an abnormal failure for
this system. I then swapped desktops back to continue my email and then 
no mouse or anything else just like one of the original hard lockups.
A bit early to draw conclusions but could it be that the bios also executes
a hlt instruction in a System Management Interrupt?? Perhaps on detecting a 
hot cpu or something??
Other info I have uncovered which I think disproves my above theory:
I earlier decided to try some more things with my apic ack delay patch and found
that it was still able to prevent the lockups on my system when moved to the end
of the  smp_apic_timer_interrupt()????, way after the apic ack????
At least this is so on my preempt lowlat vhz64 1000hz 2.4.24 kernel.
What this tells me is that on an nforce2 system if the smp_apic_timer_interrupt()
routine completes execution in under about 1us time since the hardware
interrupt occurred then the system can (will?) hard lock-up.
Why?
I also altered the CLK_Ctl MSR bits along the lines of changes since model 4 
Athlon and found nothing useful - they appear to me to be already optimised
on my model 8 cpu.

Ross.
