All things considered I'd still prefer forbidding FUSE mounts on non-leaf
dirs. For name space sanity. And it may be easier to get the whole thing
accepted:
-	One could argue that the existing name space is extended rather than
	changed [for a subset of processes], what Al Viro seems to reject.
-	The processes which cannot be ptraced/sent a signal by the mount
	owner are not "forced" to traverse the FUSE mount for the sake of
	name space invariancy, with all associated security problems: they
	can see everything up to the leaf node of all the usual mounts.
But put otherwise: is there a compelling reason to permit FUSE mounts on
non-leaf nodes?
Can FUSE mount on a file like NFS?
What is your opinion about replacing the ptrace check by a signal check
(later on, no hurry)?
