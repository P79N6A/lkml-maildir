The two drivers cover different versions of the Kahlua firmware. VSA1
was the original (at least AFAIK) firmware block. It provides SB16
emulation but has no hooks for drivers to 'take over' properly as you
really want to hook into SMI. VSA2 (the next gen firmware) had various
changes and differences and Cyrix long ago released a rather icky but
working 'native' driver for that.
I have the Cyrix public and most of the earlier NDA documentation if
there are questions but I can't redistribute it.
