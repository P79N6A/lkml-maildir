Hello dear list readers,
Since 2.2.x got out i have a very strange problem with my atapi
cdrom drive. Everytime i try to mount any cdrom from it, the
kernel get totally locked, even does not allow me to change my
virtual console anymore, does not accept requests over network,
nothing, like the machine has no power .
i have no scsi, pure ide. the cdrom gets detected as
"LTN362, ATAPI CDROM drive", speed is 36x and is /dev/hdc .
The last message in my syslog is
	kernel: VFS: Disk change detected on device ide0(3,64)
which seems no help to me as i get this message every time
i change my cdrom medium.
i noticed when executig the mount command, the green "activity light"
goes on, than kernel locks, but light does not go out. the cdrom
is still spinning inside (can hear it).
so far i tried 2.2.0, 2.2.2, 2.2.3 and 2.2.5 (nor ac patches).
My system is a pentium MMX 200Mhz (not overclocked), 256MB Ram, 2 NIC's
(ibm tokenring card, pci-ne2000 card).
I certanly would like to help in debugging this problem, but i am by no
means a kernel hacker, so someone can assist me a bit how to get
more information out of this situation ?
sincerly,
	Markus
