I wonder if you could have an indirection table for the hash, which
may allow you to allocate the hash memory from discontinuous, per
node chunks? Wouldn't the extra pointer chase be a similar cost to
incurring TLB misses when using the vmalloc scheme?
That _may_ help with relocating hashes for hotplug as well (although
I expect the hard part may be synchronising access).
Probably too ugly. Just an idea though.
