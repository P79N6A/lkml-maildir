That is not what Linus said on LKML only a week or two ago.  He said git 
pulls are just fine.  It is the content of the git pull that matters.  It 
has to be bug fixes only.  As Linus said, and I couldn't agree more, it 
would be silly to limit the method of patch submission given only the 
content is meant to be limited.
