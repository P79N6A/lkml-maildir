Right, but the memory accouting was a much bigger and more intrusive
patch than I wanted to include as an example.

Would you also be happy with the restriction that a task couldn't be
moved in/out of a beancounter container by any task other than itself?
If so, the beancounter can_attach() method could simply return false
if current != tsk, and then you'd not need to worry about locking in
this situation.

I thought that we solved that problem by having a tmp_bc field in the
task_struct that would take precedence over the main bc if it was
non-null?
