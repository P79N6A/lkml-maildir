s/mplayer/X11/
The behaviour on my noteboot (512MB, no swap) is that X keeps grabbing
more memory until either I or OOM take measures.
The interesting part about it is that Mozilla and gcfclient seem to
cause the memory leak - X frees up to 400MB when one of those is
closed - but according to top, X owns that memory.
Anyway, I am quite sure that this is not a kernel problem, so please
take lkml out of any replies. :)
