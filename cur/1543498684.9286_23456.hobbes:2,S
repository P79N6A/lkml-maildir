You could try the patch, reshuffle your disk and easily might get
another 2x speedup. Situation is like this:
		FSCKspeed	SPACEefficiency		NORMALspeed
normal ext2	low		good			high
ext2 with bs=4K	high		bad			high
ext2+my diff	high		good			lower
(and, probably)
ext2+my+bs=4K	veryhigh	bad			lower
Setting bs=4K is completely orthogonal to my patch, they should be
pretty efficient together.
