BK as of this morning already contains the bounce patch, so I only applied 
the IDE bounce enable and it worked fine. - Thanks!
Note there is something odd wrt IDE initialization. The driver seems to be 
trying to initialize twice and there quite a few messages output which 
don't reflect reality (probably a consequence of the double init). For 
example it says DMA disabled but checking with hdparm and in /proc/ide/via 
DMA is enabled just fine. And it says neither IDE port enabled (BIOS) which 
isn't true either.
Here is the current IDE output on boot:

But it all seems to works just fine, despite the slightly confused init...
Best regards,
