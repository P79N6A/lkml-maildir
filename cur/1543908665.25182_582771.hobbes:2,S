A task labeled star would create files labeled star, which would be
readable and writable by everyone (rule 4). This would be bad.
Over the past three decade I've seen a lot of secure installations
but I have never seen one where they really wanted to deny any
real application access to "/". That's a major reason for chrooted
environments.
Remember also that a process labeled Coffee would have read access
to floor files, all access to star files (e.g. /dev/null), read and
write access to Coffee objects, and no others unless specified. If
you are serious about reducing the programs a Coffee process can run
you can do so by moving them off the floor, that is, giving them
a different label, say "Tea". There is a cost to doing this, which
is that you now have to give other labels explicit access to Tea
objects. This is how you would implement a Biba integrity policy.
So, can you give me an example where you don't want access to any
file system objects (no read or execute access on floor) and are still
doing something useful? Remember that you can't exec a program if
you can't access it.
I think that access to the file system namespace is universally
required. I'm open to education.
