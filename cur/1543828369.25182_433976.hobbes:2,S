So lets enable it in the kernel, and let the distros turn it off.
The Joe User who isn't a kernel hacker won't be running 2.6.17
in a long time.  He'll be running whatever his distro packages for him,
and they will know how to disable (or patch out) window scaling.
Someone who compiles his own kernel runs into all sorts of
issues, this is just one more of them.

Yes.  And make sure you complain to those running the bad
box as well.
