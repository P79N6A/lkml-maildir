Subject: 2.3.4[78] no networking with 3c509 card
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

FYI:
With both 2.3.47 and 48, unable to up the 3c509 driver when compiled
into the kernel.  Works fine when compiled as module.
