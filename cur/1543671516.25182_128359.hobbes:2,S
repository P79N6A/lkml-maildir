That is "implementation dependent", and not a rule. 'sh' may
take additional parameters after '-c'. In the case of Linux
which uses `bash` for `sh` this can be helpful since when
bash is envoked with ths '-c' argument, $0 becomes the next
parameter, instead if the file-name, and $1 becomes the second, etc.
