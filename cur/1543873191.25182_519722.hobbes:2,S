Thank you Christoph for that informative response to my comments.  I
take it that you consider read_write.c to be code of the highest
quality and maintainability.  If you have something specific in mind
when you write "utter bullshit" and "half-knowledge", I'd love to hear
it.
Now, for those who still care to respond as if improving the kernel
were a goal that you and I can share, a question:  When
generic_file_llseek needs the inode in order to retrieve the current
file size, it goes through f_mapping (the pagecache entry?) rather
than through f_path.dentry (the dentry cache?).  All other inode
retrievals in read_write.c go through f_path.dentry.  Why?  Or is this
a question that can only be asked on linux-fsdevel?
Cheers,
- Michael
