Stop breaking kernels from compiling? ;-) If people tested their patches
before fixing them, would make it easier ...
Or as Nish suggested, fixing some of them helps. it's exhausting to try
to debug all of them myself. Yes, I'm aware that some require specific
hardware access, and are a pain in the butt ...
I can very easily test fixes that are sent to me as a straight patch 
URL on top of the kernel in question, anything else is a hassle (hint:
this ain't a full-time job for me ;-))
