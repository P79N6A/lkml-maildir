that is a fatal misunderstanding on your part. lkml is a perfectly fine 
place to report Linux bugs, why should testers be aware of the zillions 
of tiny, mostly irrelevant lists mentioned in the MAINTAINERS file?
Maintainers are required to read lkml for bugreports regarding their 
subsystems - not the other way around. If a tester manages to Cc: a 
maintainer (be that a person or a list alias) that's a bonus, but not a 
requirement at all ...
