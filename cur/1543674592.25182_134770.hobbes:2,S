Hello,
I get this message when trying to use irda with 2.5.x. I know it has
been there for a long time, but since nothing happens, I wonder if
anyone knows about it? I don't really need to unload it, but when I
reboots (or shutdowns) my pc, it hangs at "deconfiguring network
interfaces". Which is quite annoying. I guess I can change my
init-scripts to now do that, but...
Module irtty_sir cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in
include/linux/module.h:456
Best regards,
Stian
