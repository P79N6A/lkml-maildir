LOL... Well, as far as I'm concerned -- let Microsoft use UNIX source
code.  Who gives a rat's rear if they give the credit -- Microsoft is a
special exception.  If they take BSD source code, then so be it, if it
makes their OS just a little bit more stable, fine.  Although, my
impression is that it will *NOT* be as stable:  They'll lose stability
unless they "rewrite" that BSD code so that their hackers can understand
it's purpose just a wee bit better.. which they've probably already gone
and done.
