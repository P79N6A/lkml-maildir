Subject: [PATCH] libata: only ports >= 0 need to synchronize
In a discussio with Jeff Garzik, he mentioned that the serialization
for the libata port probes only needs to be within the domain of a host.
This means that for the first port of each host (with ID 0), we don't
need to wait, so we can relax our serialization a little.
