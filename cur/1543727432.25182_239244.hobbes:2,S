Lets get rid of root, I mean you don't need root, you could just turn
your computer off.
What planet are you living on Jens ?
End users have lots of reasons for being able to access /dev/cdrom
directly and also often for groups of users to access a disk directly
(for example Oracle databases).
That means any security model that isn't based around things beyond
basic device access is flawed.

support for it ?
