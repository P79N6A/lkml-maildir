I am not so sure about that.
Please correct me if I am wrong, but contact stop in an emergency retract
shakes the head assembly badly as well. It subjects the head assembly to
higher acceleration than a normal seek, and a nasty impulse at impact with
the stopper.  And I very much doubt it is nice to the heads to slide into
the parking zone at high speed and hit the bumper while over it.
Unless I missed something, I don't why an emergency retract would not be as
big a problem as an emergency unload.
Maybe we should hunt down some proper datasheets for drives lacking head
load/unload technology, and check what they say about emergency unloads...
