Hiren,
The gcc-2.96 released with RedHat 7.0 is a development snapshot of the 
compiler, not an offical gcc release.  It has some changes which makes it 
impossible to build a kernel.  RedHat 7.0 also includes a rpm with kgcc ( 
"Kernel GCC" ) which provides the compile you should use for this task.
Over the past couple of weeks, there has been a lot of discussion on this 
mailing list of this topic.  Check the archives for more of the gory details.
Good luck!
David
