There must be something more to it. I got a clean -mm and it still
does not build after applying the patch. It does have less problems,
but it still won't build. I tried to get it to compile for half an
hour, but considering the amount of sleep I got (and my experience),
there is no surprise that I failed miserably. After fixing the
complaint about a structure not having a 'x86' member, it died in the
linker complaining about stuff relating to rwsem.h.
