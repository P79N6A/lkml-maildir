Hm, what do you mean by "instance"?  My /sys/class/pci_bus has the
individual pci busses:
 $ tree /sys/class/pci_bus/
 /sys/class/pci_bus/
 |-- 0000:00
 |   |-- bridge -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00
 |   `-- cpuaffinity
 |-- 0000:01
 |   |-- bridge -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0
 |   `-- cpuaffinity
 `-- 0000:02
     |-- bridge -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0
     `-- cpuaffinity
We already have the cpuaffinity stuff in there, why not more, pci bus
specific things?
thanks,
