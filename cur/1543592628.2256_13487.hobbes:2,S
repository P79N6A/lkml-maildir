Moin,
I have a DualAthlon System here (2xAthlon 1.2GHz, 256MB RAM, icp-vortex
6513RS/128MB, 3*9.1GB/10k HD, Dual 3com980 NIC) which runs really fine with
kernel 2.4.4 and as far as I can see now with 2.4.5.
Now I am interested in comparing this system's performance to others. Can
someone here give me a hand on how to do this best?
And, if there are any special things (compilers, tools, ?) that I should
use, please point me to...
Olli
