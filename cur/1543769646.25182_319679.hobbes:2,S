Why are you using LSM for this?
LSM should be used for comprehensive access control frameworks which 
significantly enhance or even replace existing Unix DAC security.
We're going to end up with a proliferation of arbitrary security features 
lacking an overall architectural view (I've written about this before, 
see 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0503.1/0300.html
).
I think it would be better to implement this directly.
