The kernel version installed on the server is 2.4.18-5
Would that be a problem ? Do I need to upgrade my kernel ?
Since the memory doesn't seem to be a problem apparently, what should be my next step to check the flaw.
Although this happened only once, this could lead to a possible problem.
Thanks a lot for your help.
