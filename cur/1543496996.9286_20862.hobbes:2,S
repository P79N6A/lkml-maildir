Make sure that nothing else is trying to read from /proc/kmsg.  I have
seen and had reports of this behavior when something attempts to
compete with klogd.
This can be tested by running klogd with the -s switch.  This setting
causes klogd to use a kernel syscall to retrieve the contents of the
kernel message ring buffers rather than using /proc/kmsg.

This should not be a problem.  You will probably need to compile a
copy of klogd in order to include debugging symbols.
