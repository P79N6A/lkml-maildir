Kerneldoc needs to be updated -- no @parent or @fmt.  Also no error
returns.  But you could say that after this routine runs, the kobject
should be deallocated by kobject_put() and not by calling kfree()
directly.

In which case kobject_put() isn't needed?

Should you say something here about uevents?

Looks like this should call kobject_add_varg() instead of duplicating
its code.

Could the comments be made shorter by saying merely that this routine 
combines calls to kobject_init() and kobject_add_ng()?

Looks okay.
Did you want to add an extra kobject_put() to the end of kobject_del()?  
Or did you want to define a new kobject_destroy() that combines calls 
to kobject_del() and kobject_put()?
