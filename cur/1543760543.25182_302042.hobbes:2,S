Can you check to see whether there are any BIOS updates available
for your box?  It looks to me like your USB controllers are wired
to IRQ9, and that's how the BIOS is leaving them configured.
But ACPI is telling us they're on IRQ10, which seems like a BIOS
bug.
Can you also post the complete dmesg log without "acpi=off"?  There
might be an ACPI interrupt link device for the USB controller, and
maybe there's something wrong there.
