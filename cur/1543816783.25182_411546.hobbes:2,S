Really?! Read *any* specification of NAND FLASH then.

No, it is not. NAND FLASH is used in CFs while NOR FLASH is used in
BIOSes.

What FLASH technology do you think CF cards are based on? It seems you
think it's NOR FLASH, right? I believe you are wrong.

Once again, you seem to assume NOR FLASH, and AFAIK that's not the
case. For NAND FLASH block (128Kb) erase time is in order of 2ms, and
write time is about 20ms.
