It'd probably suffice to pass on the command line and BIOS settings
which are unavaible once Linux has booted - or for the case that the
first kernel needs a different command line than the second, find a
mechanism to pass the other on, maybe just passargs="blah \"we have
escapes\"" and just purge anything else like MMU tables and such,
i. e. have a complete fresh boot besides that.
