Hmm interest enough,
But please see man.
NOTES
       On Linux, the only supported domain for this call is AF_UNIX (or
 syn-
       onymously,  AF_LOCAL).   (Most  implementations have the same
restric-
       tion.)
Only for AF_UNIX..
Well, as many said Live patching is very historical & authoritative
function on especially carrier, telecom vendor.
If linux want to be adopted on mission critical world, this function is
esseintial.
