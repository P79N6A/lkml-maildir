First of all, thanks for forward port. I think this patch is quite usefull
for both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, but I can't check it on all kernels myself.
comments:
1. why have you replaced list_del with list_del_init in my patch?
It's not required.
2. locks are ok, as for i_list, i_hash lists.
3. Missed 
+list_add(&inode->i_sb_list, &sb->s_inodes);
in get_new_inode_fast() function. Please add it.
I looked through, everything else looks ok.
[your patch]
Kirill
