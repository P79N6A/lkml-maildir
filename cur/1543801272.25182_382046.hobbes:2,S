Yes, this is undoubtedly the case; we developed it organically based on
our evolving needs, and we're only now (maybe a bit belatedly) stepping
back to take a breath and see how things should be logically split out.

Right.  The purpose of the whole ipath_layer.c file has perhaps been
unclear; we've been holding back a network driver that makes use of it,
to keep the size of the review patches down.  Some of the other
verbs-related routines in the core driver are in the process of finding
a new home, as you suggested.
As ever, thanks for the comments.
