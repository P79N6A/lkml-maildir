This would be especially handy for network booting: you only need to send
the one file to the client, and it boots the kernel and loads the initrd
without any extra requests/parameters/configuration needed.

Probably not - the kernel would handle all of it.  It sounds like Linus
and Al are in favour of this, so it will likely be in 2.5.early.  Having
the tar be extracted into ramfs has the added benefit that you don't need
to 'pre-configure' ramdisk size, make dd initrd images, or waste memory
that is representing empty fs space.  Conversely, if the root is ramfs
you also don't need to worry about the ramdisk fs being too small if you
need to create some temprary files there...  It is a win in all cases.
Cheers, Andreas
