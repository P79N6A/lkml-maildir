Yes, it would work nicely. 
But, the problem is that the struct user_beancounter (part of
wombat_controller above) is a _copy_ of the original, not the original
itself. We cannot keep the original (in _each_ controller), as there may
be more than one controller in the system and user_beancounter structure
is created/owned/destroyed by the beancounter infrastructure and not the
controller.
