  Yes, I've seen your reports. Thanks for them and sorry for being a bit
unresponsive (I have a lot of other work...).

  Yes, this seems to be correct analysis.

  Right.

  Yes, this is definitely safer check and should also catch the case
when jh was released from memory so buffer_jbd() is not needed any more.

  BTW: I've also written another version of the patch using a bit
different approach. When I have some time I can benchmark them against
