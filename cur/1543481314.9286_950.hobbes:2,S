Subject: SCSI driver problem with cdrom?

Hello PPL,
	I've got 2 scsi cdroms on my scsi chain.  The first is a
Plextor cd-r that is mountable.  The second is a Pioneer DR-506S which
whenever the cd-r is on the chain, will not be mountable.  If I remove the
cd-r from the chain the cdrom works perfectly.  Now I haven't been able to
define this as a non-jumper termination problem.  The cdrom (I was told)
was set as terminant, and the cd-r was non-terminant.  They both have
different IDs also.  Here is some info on my system:
	Motherboard: ASUS P2B-D
	SCSI card: Symbios Logic SYM8951U
	SCSI card: Symbios Logic 875
and so that this doesn't get redundant if I need to respond, here's whats
being said in my messages file:

Thanks for making it this far, and please don't rip me too hard if there's
a really simple solution, I'm very new to scsi.
