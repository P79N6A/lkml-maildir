Did you do a normal read from memory, or did you use port-i/o? I think
you should use the latter. Of course, your card could be at 2000h in
stead of 1000h, or at X000h for that matter. I'm not very familiar with
the EISA architecture, but I do know that each card can use the
following I/O ranges:
X000h-X0FFh; X400h-X4FFh; X800h-X8FFh; XC00-XCFF, where X is the slot
number. There is a book on the EISA architecture available free of
charge as a PDF file from www.mindshare.com/pdf/eisabook.pdf. Perhaps
you'll find what you need to know from studying that. I hope this helps.
Veel success ermee,
Camiel.
