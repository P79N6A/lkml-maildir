Thanks, that will be a useful data point for Nathan.

Sorry, I didn't mean to be unclear.  I'm merely a user of XFS and
am in no position to make a statement except that "it works for me"
with the usual caveat that my platform and workload may differ.
However, I do work on NFS for a living and can point out that in 
the 2.6 SMP case there have been issues with the unnatural acts
knfsd needs to perform upon the dcache, and that these might be
factors in the problems you're seeing.  In particular, the stack
traces I've seen just might be caused by dcache confusion caused
by one of the bugs I've mentioned.  Or not.
I just wanted to point out that there are more potential sources
of bugs in your setup than just XFS.
Greg.
