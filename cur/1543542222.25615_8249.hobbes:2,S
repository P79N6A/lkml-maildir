The root thread can tell Linux: I'm a pthreads root thread, I don't want
POSIX signals, I want raw signals.
The advantage is that for things like kill(threaded_pid,SUSPEND) 
and kill(threaded_pid,SOME_SIGNAL_THAT_POSIX_SAYS_A_RANDOM_THREAD_GETS)
does not have to be in a place where it slows down sensible signal
usage.
Libc can make sure that all the usual signal operations in non-root
threads update the per-thread signal information and then the root
thread can do:
            got_a_signal:
                        find a thread that takes this signal
                        pthread_kill(that_thread,signal);
Signals are slower but using this feature of signals/threads is dumb
anyways.
