I had exactly the same issue as you, but this time it was on my laptop
when using a 3CCFE575CT CardBus 10/100 NIC. The only solution I found
was to use SourceForge's PCMCIA-CS instead of the built-in PCMCIA
support.
I tracked down the problem to PCI resource allocation, although never
knew what was causing it: the CardBus bridge was using the PCI subsystem
to allocate resources for my CardBus NIC, but it failed and tried to
assign an invalid I/O range (the starting I/O address was higher than
the ending I/O address). I wasn't able to fix it, but in newer kernel
releases, the problem was fixed.
Now, I've got other problems: the card works correctly and I get full
throughput when sending data using FTP/NFS/SCP (~12MBps) but no more
than 4MBps when receiving files.
