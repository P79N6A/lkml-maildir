There is not second caller :)  Also it wouldn't work because you check
for kprobe_running() which wouldn't be true for it.  It also means
you go through the whole notifier chain mechanism for every userspace
page fault when kprobes are running which is the least of them.
So let's no do odd preparations for the future but optimize for
the current case and add things if needed in the future.  Note that
I plan to send similar patches for all kprobes supporting architectures
so that we have common code again.  Eventually notify_page_fault should
move into include/linux/kprobes.h
