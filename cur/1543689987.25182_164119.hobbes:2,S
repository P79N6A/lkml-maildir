Hmm. I did manage to build it, although I got my version from here
instead of ATI's site:
http://www.schneider-digital.de/html/download_ati.html
Maybe there's a difference. Using the new glue code, I also managed to
build a kernel module for the older 2.9.13 driver as 3.2.5 seems a bit
flakey with my radeon 9700 pro.
