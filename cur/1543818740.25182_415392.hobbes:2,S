I see, that makes it indeed a bit more complicated to preserve the 
symlink, I thought you had something to automatically update the .config, 
when you apply/remove patches.
Anyway, as I mentioned in one of the patches, we can start to relax the 
syntax requirements, e.g. we can add something to ignore unknown symbols, 
so you don't have to update the .config all the time, only because a 
config option was added/removed.
I don't want to change the default behaviour yet, but there is now a lot 
of room for experiments, e.g. it's now possible to properly support a 
miniconfig by adding an option to set all unknown symbols to 
n/m/y/default.
bye, Roman
