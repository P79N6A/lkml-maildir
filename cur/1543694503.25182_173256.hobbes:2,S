Since the default (hit in case nothing else fits and where it would return)
returns -ENOTTY, shouldn't the return be -ENOTTY?
The function could almost at that point remove the default: case and return
-ENOTTY at the end of the function and still be correct...
Of course, it's just wrong to not have the default case, but just as a
point..
