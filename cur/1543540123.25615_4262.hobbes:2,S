Are you sure you showed us your entire command line? Isn't the truth
slightly longer than that? You see, the limit on command line size is 79
bytes so if your total length is approaching this limit and
"console=tty0" is at the end if can easily get chopped off.
Seeing you are the same guy who reported the oops in kmem_cache_alloc() -
did you try 2.4.0-test5? It contains the suggested fix.
