Ah, yes.  That makes sense.

Nevermind my patch, its bogus.  I was mistaken earlier in thinking it was better with the "+1" removed.  Subsequent testing has demonstrated that the issue is still present, even with my "fix" applied.  The root issue seems to be real, but I cant spy it in the code via visual inspection.  Reverting the patch outright does seem to restore proper balancer behavior.  (Note that the commit-id for Peter's patch has since changed...probably due to a recent rebase in sched-devel).  Perhaps someone with a better understanding of the load calculation will see it.
