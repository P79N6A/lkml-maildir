Well, I'd prefer having (one or more) people to do work on the whole
area, not onle CE / embedded related stuff. It woule be *really* cool to
have somebody to whom you just post a URL to your repo to care about
reviewing it, sending it upstream etc. I guess embedded work is a big
player there, but don't forget the minor architectures and other repos
with li'l enhancements.
