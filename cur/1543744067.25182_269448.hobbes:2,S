As I said in the email, we need know the bus type to decode and encode
address. If you use platform_notify, you must do something like this:
switch (dev->bus)
{
case pci_bus_type:
bind PCI devices with ACPI devices
break;
case ide_bus_type:
bind IDE devices with ACPI devices
break;
....
}
But note this method requires all bus types are build-in. If a bus type
is in a loadable module (such as IDE bus), the method will failed. I
searched current tree, only ARM implemented 'platform_notify', but ARM
only cares PCI bus, ACPI cares about all bus types.

Ok, I'll try to fix them.
Thanks,
