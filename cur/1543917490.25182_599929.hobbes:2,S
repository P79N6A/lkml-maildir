Actually, the *really* nice thing to do would be to just add the reason 
something got enabled into the ".config" file.
IOW, wouldn't it be nice if the .config file just said
	...
	CONFIG_ACPI=y		# selected by X86_64_ACPI_NUMA
	CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS=y	# user choice
	...
etc, since the config process actually does know these things?
That way, there's always a fairly straightforward way to see why some 
configuration is the way it is (and the .config file is not only useful 
for "make oldconfig", it's also what normally gets passed around for bug 
reports, and is part of distro kernel packages etc, so it would seem to be 
the right place, no?)
