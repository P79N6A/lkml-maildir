Subject: [PATCH 11/13] checkpatch: struct file_operations should normally be const
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@canonical.com>
In the general use case struct file_operations should be a const object.
Check for and warn where it is not.  As suggested by Steven and Ingo.
