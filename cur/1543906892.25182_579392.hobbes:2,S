HSM uses atime as a _hint_. The only even remotely valid argument is 
Mutt, and even that one could easily be fixed _it is not even installed 
by default on most distros_ and nobody but me uses it ;) [and i've been 
using Mutt on noatime filesystems for years] So basically a single type 
of package and use-case (against tens of thousands of packages) held all 
of Linux desktop IO performance hostage for 10 years, to the tune of a 
20-30-50-100% performance degradation (depending on the workload)? Wow. 
And the atime situation is _so_ obvious, what will we do in the much 
less obvious cases?
