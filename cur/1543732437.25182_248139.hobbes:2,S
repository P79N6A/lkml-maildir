How would we go about finding out how many data forks were in a file? 
Because in order to be able to retrieve data from a fork we would need
to know that the fork were there.  Currently this would imply that we
go looking through mtab or some such to find out what fs we're running
on, which seems ugly.
Alternatively we go through the _exciting_ task of making every other
fs (with the exceptions of ntfs, and whatever it is that macs use,
which would need there own custom code) and add code that effectively
goes
getNumForks(fileref){ return 1;} 
or add a new open call that can take a fork number...
either way we have to add a new syscall, that doesn't conform to any
real standard(though i suppose it would be possible to use
macOS/windows style fork iopening interface)
I personally like the concept of having multiple forks in a file, but
in this case I'm inclined towards usermode first, then if it takes off
add kernel level support.
