The ideal situation is for you to send two sets of patches, one for 2.4 
tree and one for 2.5 tree.  Those will get applied to 2.4.21-pre and 
2.5.<latest>.  Patches against 2.4.20 proper are ok as long as they 
apply correctly to the latest 2.4.21-pre tree (so, patches against 
2.4.21-pre are preferred)
If the patches are the same for 2.4 and 2.5, just send one set and note 
that fact.  My preference would be to address these patches
	To: davem@redhat.com
	CC: netdev@oss.sgi.com, jgarzik@pobox.com
(David, feel free to correct me here, or direct patches to me)
When you receive bug fixes, forwarding ASAP would be very much appreciated.
