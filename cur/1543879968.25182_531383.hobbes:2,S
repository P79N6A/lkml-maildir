No, to be accurate the count would have to be made with the profile lock
held, which would then need to be released so as not to use GFP_ATOMIC
for the allocations.
An iterative approach could be taken where we do something like
repeat:
  lock profile
     count
     if preallocated < count
        unlock profile
        if (! allocate count - preallocated)
           Fail
        goto repeat
  do replacement
