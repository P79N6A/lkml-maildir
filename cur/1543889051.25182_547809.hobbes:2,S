That seems like a really high number to me, in terms of the number of
blocks being check pointed here.  Should we be more aggressively
writing journal blocks?  Or having sub-transactions so we can write
smaller atomic chunks, while still not forcing them to disk?  
I dunno, I'm probably smoking something here.  
Just thinking out loud, what's the worst possible layout of inodes and
such that can be written in ext3?  And can we generate a test case
which re-creates that layout and then the handling of it?  Is it when
we try to write N inodes, and we do inode 1, then N, then 2, then N-1,
etc?  So that the writes are spread out all over the place and don't
have any clustering in them at all?

How much data was written overall at this point?  And was it sorted at
all, or were just sub-chunks of it sorted?

It sounds like Mark Fasheh just needs to have a bigger test case to
also hit the same wall.  His hardware just moves it out a bit.

So what happens when your vaporFS is told to allocate in 128Mb chunks
doing this same test?  I assume it gets into the same type of problem?  
I'm happy to see these tests happening, even if I don't have alot to
contribute otherwise.  :[  
One thought, do you have a list of the blocks being written for the
dirty block device inode?  Should we be trying to push them out
whenenever we write data blocks which are near by?  
I wonder how ext4 will do with this?
