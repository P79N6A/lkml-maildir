Hi. I have a bunch of SCSI disks with odd HP firmware that are formatted
with 520 byte sectors. When I try to use these disks with Linux, the
kernel crashes after scanning the SCSI bus. (confirmed with 2.0.36, 2.2.5,
2.2.10; see my original message to linux-scsi at
http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~wingc/scsicrash/email.txt
)
If I comment out the code in drivers/scsi/sd.c responsible for "deleting
the device entries" and just set the capacity to 0 for all SCSI disks with
non-standard sector sizes:
http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~wingc/scsicrash/no-scsi-crash.patch
then I get an I/O error when Linux attempts to read the partition table:
Jun 30 16:18:48 machine kernel:  sdc:scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:20, sector 0 
Jun 30 16:18:48 machine kernel:  unable to read partition table 
but otherwise everything is fine, no crash, and I can still talk to the
disks via the SCSI generic devices. (they are not usable as SCSI disks,
though)
I don't understand enough about the SCSI code to be able to be able to
find a better workaround, but the above patch does seem to stop the kernel
from crashing. (tested on 2.2.10)
Does anyone care to comment on this?
Thank you very much,
Chris Wing

p.s. does anyone know how I might go about reformatting these disks to 512
byte sectors?
