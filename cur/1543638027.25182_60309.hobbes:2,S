I suspect what Christoph is remember is that the in-kernel API was still 
in flux and up for discussion.

syscall 250 isn't used in anything Red Hat shipped, that was a matter 
of experimentation I was doing in recent aio development trees (which 
is what the 2.4.18 patches are, as they still cause that VM to OOM under 
rather trivial io patterns).

You haven't looked at the code very closely then.  It checks that the 
payload matches, and that the caller is coming from the vsyscall pages.  
Yes, the dynamic syscall thing is a horrific kludge that shouldn't be 
used, but the vsyscall technique is rather useful.  This is something 
that x86-64 gets wrong by not requiring the vsyscall page to need an 
mmap into the user's address space: UML cannot emulate vsyscalls by 
faking the mmap.
