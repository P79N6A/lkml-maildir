Does anyone have or know of any SCSI benchmarking tools?
I have just installed two 9.1Gig LVD drives on a Adaptec 2940 U2W
controller.
Everything is working fine in Linux as far as access to the drives. I have
noticed that there is not a big performance difference from my IDE drive to
the SCSI devices. Also I expected less CPU activity due to offloading the
i/o instructions to the controllers i/o processor. I actually have seen more
CPU resources being used now.
Anyone come across the same symptoms? 
Any information on tuning the SCSI devices? I have left everything at there
default settings in the kernel.
