So what happens when:
cpu0:                         cpu1:
kill_pid(vt_pid,....)         fn_SAK()->vc_reset()->put_pid(xchg(&vt_pid, NULL))
Can't kill_pid dereference vt_pid after put_pid is called?
It's a microscopic window, and requires the user to attempt a vt switch
and a sak simultaneously but I think it is there.
