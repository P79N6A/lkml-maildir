Well, of all work-arounds for the problem this one is probably the worst: it
wastes space on good drives and runs out of space for sure on bad ones.
What is so bad about the simple way: the one who wants to write (e.g. fs) and
knows _where_ to write simply uses another newly allocated block and dumps the
old one on a blacklist. The blacklist only for being able to count them (or get
the sector-numbers) in case you are interested. If you weren't you might as
well mark them allocated and that's it (which I would presume a _bad_ idea). If
there are no free blocks left, well, then the medium is full. And that is just
about the only cause for a write error then (if the medium is writeable at
all).
Don't make the thing bigger than it really is...

_should_ do, or do you know for sure?
Take real life: it is near midnight and your ide hd has just filled its last
available bad-block-mapping. The next write comes in and your fs goes boom. You
notice next morning and work is waiting for you. Can you mount it again? Is
your data being corrupted? Well, you need some luck ...
On the other hand, you could have been informed by mail that your ide-drives'
fs has just mapped another bad block and the total number of bad blocks just
reached 4 percent of the available space on the drive.
Why do you trust hd manufacturing sites in Malaysia or Hungary or whereever,
when you can make _sure_ yourself?
I don't get it, sorry.

Well, this is for sure nothing for a fs, you are right. But lets fix the _easy_
things first ...
