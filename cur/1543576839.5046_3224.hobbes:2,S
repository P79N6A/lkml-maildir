Subject: UDP ports 800-n used by NFS client in 2.2.17

Does anyone know what causes netstat to show UDP port 800
as active on a Linux NFS client with 2.2.17 kernel when an NFS filesystem
is mounted?
Using Debian Linux 2.2 with Kernel 2.2.17 with one NFS filesystem mounted, 
I see
the following:
    rsh@lithium [3]$ netstat -n -a -u
    Active Internet connections (servers and established)
    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address          Foreign Address
    udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:800            0.0.0.0:*
If I unmount the NFS Filesystem, the UDP port disappears.
It appears that each NFS mounted filesystem uses a separate UDP
port, and that they count down from port 800.  I.e. the first
mount uses UDP port 800, the second UDP port 799.
"lsof -i" doesn't show this port belonging to any process, and the "-p" 
option to netstat
doesn't show any process info either. I assume that this means that it's a 
kernel thing
rather than a process level thing.
A network sniff while mounting and umounting the NFS filesystem
doesn't show any traffic on UDP port 800 - I just see portmapper, mountd 
and nfs
traffic.
Does anyone know what this is or where I can look in the source for more info?
I've searched /usr/src/linux/fs/nfs/*.c for 800 and 320 (800 in hex) 
without success.
