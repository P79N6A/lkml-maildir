I have other measures to protect the consistency there; forgot about
them until you reminded me. There are simple hooks in the page
allocation and freeing code so that pages allocated and freed during
suspending/resuming come from and go to a fix memory pool. All pages in
this pool are saved with the atomic copy, regardless of whether they're
used or not. This makes the image state consistent even if drivers
allocate or free memory during suspending (including during the
device_suspend/resume calls).
The freezer hooks also catch processes forking or exiting during
suspend, and preserve consistency there too. Right after an init S, the
network code was often seen to be running processes in the middle of a
suspend, after freezing had finished. This works correctly now.

I'll say nothing here; I'm not thinking about suspend-to-ram at all.
