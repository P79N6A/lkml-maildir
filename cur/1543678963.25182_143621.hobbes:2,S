The PCI spec doesn't allow more than four slots per bus.  Some boards 
try to put on 5 or 6 slots anyhow, violating the spec.  It's no wonder 
there are so many problems with those boards.
You can often get them to work anyhow, but it involves swapping cards 
around in slots until you find an arrangement that works, but it's still 
unreliable.
