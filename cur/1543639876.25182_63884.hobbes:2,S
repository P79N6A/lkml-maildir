The warning about ioctl's is fairly bogus.  It gets reported for *any*
unknown ioctl, whether it looks like it might be raid related or not.
So I wouldn't worry about that.
I have a new collection of patches for md which break if fairly
thoroughly.  I am about to started testing/fixing and will
make sure that mkfs/fsck/mount work for raid{linear,0,1,5}.
