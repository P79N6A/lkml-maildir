Actually, this occured at 2.4.2
I searched though the archives, and the only people who were able to get
this resolved were those with a non-isapnp card (by added isapnp=0).
However, I have an isapnp card and the driver doesn't think my card
exists. If I lod it, withot options, I get:
russ kernel: opl3sa2: ISA PnP activate failed
russ kernel: opl3sa2: No PnP cards found
russ kernel: opl3sa2: 0 PnP card(s) found.
OK, so I use my old isapnp.conf 
russ:/home/russ# isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf
then insmod it like this:
Board 1 has Identity 81 ff ff ff ff 20 00 a8 65:  YMH0020 Serial No -1
[checksum 81]
YMH0020/-1[0]{OPL3-SAX Sound Board}: Ports 0x240 0xE80 0x388 0x300
0x100; IRQ10 DMA0 DMA3 --- Enabled OK
YMH0020/-1[1]{OPL3-SAX Sound Board}: Port 0x204; --- Enabled OK
russ:/home/russ# insmod opl3sa2 irq=10 io=0x240 dma=0 dma2=3
mss_io=0xe80 isapnp=0
Using /lib/modules/2.4.4-ac1-lpp/kernel/drivers/sound/opl3sa2.o
/lib/modules/2.4.4-ac1-lpp/kernel/drivers/sound/opl3sa2.o: init_module:
No such device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters,
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
hmm, and kern.log says:
russ kernel: opl3sa2: Control I/O port 0x240 is not a YMF7xx chipset!
something in the changeover forgot about my card
