Hello Greg KH,
thanks for reviewing these patches.

Yes, I know. The code was imported from an external source, and the code 
was kept mostly unchanged to keep syncing easier.
But with all the problems you mentioned, I'm now going to review the 
code. I'll send an updated patch later.

OMG. I'm sorry for having submitted something like this. It was not 
tested by me, no. I'll fix it and test compiling for SMP.

I don't want to defend the original author, but perhaps these functions 
were copy&pasted from a Windoze driver.

I'll review it.

No.  I2C is used by all devices at least to access the different 
chipsets that make up the tuning.
In former times, the project had a hard time getting tuning to work in a 
reliable way, because some of these chipsets are particularly picky when 
it comes to timing and expect messages in a fixed form. Especially 
probing of other i2c devices was a problem, which locked up the i2c bus 
often.
I know that an class field for i2c adapters exists now and that i2c 
clients can check if they want to probe that bus at all now.
The DVB core is quite self contained and we decided to copy the i2c 
functionality needed for our purposes. So we ended up in using about 100 
lines of code instead of the whole i2c core.
Now that you have finished improving the i2c core, perhaps we can switch 
back to the kernel i2c system at a later time.
