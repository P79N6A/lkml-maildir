Hi,
 I have a bootable CD and normal ISO9660 data CD (linux non-bootable)
, both has linux on it.
 I don't have the BIOS password and hence cannot change the bios
startup options.
1) Is there any way to boot the CD from grub command line ?
 2) Can i access the data in ISO9660 from grub command line ?
I can boot a floppy like root(fd0)
chainloader +1
boot
simlarly windows partition like root(hd0,2)
chainloader +1
boot
Is there anything for bootable CD .
How to access data in ISO CD . Can we do it like ext2 of harddisk.
Regards
Nik
