This is a related change discussed during V16 with Nick.
The page is protected from munmap because of the down_read(mmap_sem) in
the arch specific code before calling handle_mm_fault.

Seems that mark_page_accessed was discouraged in favor SetPageReferenced.
We agreed that we wanted this change earlier (I believe that was in
November?).

That is up to the arch maintainers. Add something to arch/xx/Kconfig to
allow atomic operations for an arch. Out of the box it only works for
x86_64, ia64 and ia32.

You definitely need this for machines with high SMP counts.

Earlier releases back in September 2004 had some pte locking code (and
AFAIK Nick also played around with pte locking) but that
was less efficient than atomic operations.
