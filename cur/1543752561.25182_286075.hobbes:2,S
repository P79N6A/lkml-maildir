First of all, thanks for your concern.

No interrupt at /proc/interrupts. The ISR never gets called. If it
would, it returns IRQ_HANDLED.
As I mentioned on the first mail, using a logical analyzer I saw the
device generating interrupts behind the PCI bridge, but I didn't see
them pass through the bridge, so I didn't expect to read something at
/proc/interrupts.

Same here, ISR never gets called.

How can I do that? Don't bother explaining everything. Maybe a link 
to somewhere on the net where I can learn more?
Thanks,
