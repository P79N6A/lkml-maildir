Subject: [PATCH -mm 00/02] Update rt-mutex-design.txt per Randy Dunlap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following two patches are updates to the rt-mutex-design.txt document
which were suggested by Randy Dunlap.  The first patch fixes the problems
that Randy pointed out.  The second patch changes some indentation. I
separated the two so that people can review the changes without having to
look through the big diffs that the indentation made.
Randy,
Could you check to see if I hit all your concerns.  I might have missed
some.
Andrew,
I'm sober this time ;)
