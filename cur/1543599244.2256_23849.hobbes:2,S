I wonder if we're trying to do the impossible: an algorithm that works
great for very different workloads, without hints from the process.
Shouldn't we encourage use of madvise(2) more? And if needed, add
O_DROPBEHIND and similar flags for open(2).
The application knows how it's going to use data/memory. It should
tell the kernel so the kernel can choose the best algorithm.
