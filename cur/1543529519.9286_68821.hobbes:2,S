That means no overcommitment of memory. It's a solution, but you'll need
_huge_ swapspaces just for making sure each time emacs spawns an ls the
space for the 4 500Kb files it has open is available.

How does the VM notice that it needs to reserve space or dole it out, when
there are several root processes that need memory (named, the ftpd inetd is
spawning, ...)? They'll eat up your root allowance, and then the problem is
the same as before. Besides, this isn't a solution anyway, you don't want
to sit beside your server just in case it runs out of memory.
There is a flamewar each time the problem is discussed: The solution looks
extremely simple, there are many simple "solutions" too. But none of the
proposals gets more than half the work done; each one a different portion,
and by its very nature not in a position to do much (if anything) about the
rest.
