In my mind, one possibility for a powerful API would be to specify a
mask of acceptable physical addresses, and a "state" for what kind of
mapping you wanted - global kernel permanently mapped address, unmapped
address, per-task kernel mapped address, per-address space kernel
mapped address, etc.
Without thinking about it too much (aka I'm sticking my neck out and
am going to get shot down ;-)) it would seem possible to do the phys
mask idea inside the current buddy system without too much problem
if the mask was aligned on 2^MAX_ORDER * sizeof(struct page) boundarys?
I need to think about that one some more, but I thought I'd throw it
out to see what people think ...
