You mean ProDVD? It's a JOKE! I tried to buy a copy when it came out, 
and he doesn't take Paypal, and he doesn't take credit cards, and he 
doesn't want personal checks, and given the new rules about sending cash 
to a foreign national from the US I doubt if he makes enough to buy 
beer. Particularly since he found it easier to give a free license for 
personal use than to setup the accounts he could use to get money in 
convenient ways.

That is a problem, but I will pass on starting over when there is a fine 
  software to use. He's not the only dificult author around, or even the 
most dificult, just the most visible.
