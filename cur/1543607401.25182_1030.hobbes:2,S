But that's _your_ problem. Not the kernels.
If you have a acpi deamon that decides to make the machine go to sleep
while burning a CD, that's nothign to do with the kernel at all.
It has nothing to do with sg.c either, for that matter.

Absolutely NOT.
The kernel does not set policy. If the user says "suspend now", then we
suspend now. Whether a CD burn or anything else is going on is totally
irrelevant.

Not a way in hell. If the sg layer wants to export a "/proc/sgbusy",
that's its problem.
But if I say "suspend", and the kernel refuses, I will kill the offending
piece of crap from sg.c before you can blink an eye.
