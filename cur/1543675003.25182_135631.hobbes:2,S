I have almost the same, but without the "server cheating":
16:12:06 NFS: giant filename in readdir (len c8f2d9f0)!
got this by doing "find /mnt -type f | xargs cat > /dev/null".
The server is 2.4.20-ck4 (Con Kolivas patches: aavm, preempt, lolatency).
Also seen something about 7 min later (the find was still running):
16:19:22 nfs: server server1 not responding, still trying
16:19:25 nfs: server server1 OK
The "server1" (my desktop machine) was doing almost nothing at this time
and felt ok (still does).
