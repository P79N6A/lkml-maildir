I noticed on the kernel status doc that a revamp of kernel pcmcia is in 
the works.  Can anyone elaborate?
For example, does this mean that 16-bit PCMCIA cards will use hotplug?
Does this mean that 32-bit cards will stop requiring cardmgr to simply 
bind devices to drivers (is it too much to ask that the driver know what 
it drives :)?  The only card of mine (and I have a few 3coms, xircoms, 
lucents) that I think works sanely is my xircom 32-bit cardbus card... 
it would be nice if they all worked that way.  Even though I know that 
this will not be possible for the 16-bit pcmcia cards, IMHO atleast all 
the hotplug devices should use ONE daemon.
I'm curious and excited by the prospect... if there is anything I can do 
to help (even as a newbie I can certainly help change 
unregister/register functions or add any device tables, etc), please let 
me know.
