All the P4 family of processors uses a techniwue called quad pumping or 
something along those lines. So you actually have a 100 Mhz bus, but it can 
take action at 4 different points during the clock cycle hence Marketeering 
gives us 400Mhz bus. It is the same with AMD using the DDR bus/memory. They 
don't actually have a 266/333Mhz, bus it is really a 133/166 bus that is 
double pumped. Hope this helps.
