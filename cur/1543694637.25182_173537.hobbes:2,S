This same thing happens on my Alpha (4 x EV45, 512mb RAM).  The system
will boot fine so long as I never bring up networking... The driver
scans for and finds the devices, but as soon as the system attempts to
bring up an interface, it locks up.
On someone's suggestion, I had tried the -test5 version of de4x5.[ch]
(along with some reverted changes in Space.c), but it had the same
effects.
