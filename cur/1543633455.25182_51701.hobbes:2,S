Could you please explain this ?
I thought this was a problem of a CPU dirtying a cache line
that overlaps with an area being DMAed into. So the determining
factor should be the granularity of the dirty status of the CPU.
Are there really PCI controllers which have to physically write
much more than is transfered ?
