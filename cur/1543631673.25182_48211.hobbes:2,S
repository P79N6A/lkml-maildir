Yes, that is what we have to do now.  So, when our product is
installed, a user is presented with a confusing, and highly technical
question, the gist of which is:  please give us your root password
so we can do something you don't understand.  It's okay, trust us,
really...<grin>
Further, I would argue that if you accept that unhide is a
reasonable default for me to force into the fstab, then
it is a reasonable default for the kernel to have.
Cheers,
Jeremy
