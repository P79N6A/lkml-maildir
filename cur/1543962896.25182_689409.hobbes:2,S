Sure, but the API would be general enough to handle it.

I think we're talking past each other a little bit.
There is no irq-disabled calls as yet, therefore I don't think we should
add a lot of complex code just to _allow_ for it; at least, not until a
really compelling user comes up.
The main thing is to parallelise the code. The fact that we can trivially 
support irq-disabled calls for nowait case (if the caller supplies the
data or can handle failure) is just a bonus.

Having the fallback is fine, yes. I'd say it shouldn't often get called.

Of course ;)

I think I'd like to keep existing smp_call_function that disallows
irq-disabled calls and can't fail. Introduce a new one for irq-disabled
case.
But sure, the existing smp_call_function implementation can't fail.

I think so. At least for the call_function_single case.

For the last cases, I actually think your polling loop is pretty cool ;)
So I don't completely object to it, I just don't think we should add it
in until something wants it...
Don't let me dictate the requirements though, the only real one I had
was to make call_function_single scalable and faster, and call_function
be as optimal as possible.
