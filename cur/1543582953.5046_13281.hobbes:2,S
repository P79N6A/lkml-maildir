I agree. I have been having problems with isapnp reliably finding my
ALS100 since 2.4.1 (I think). I have just modularised isapnp which
means you can at least reload it when it fails to id the card.
Since doing that, I've noticed that the use count for isapnp in lsmod
continues rising eachtime the sb driver is removed. I am hoping to get
some more time this weekend to look at it.
