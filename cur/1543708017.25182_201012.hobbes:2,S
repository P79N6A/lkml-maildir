Humph. OK you're right. The above is of course right when all
else is equal, however slab can only be allocated from lowmem
while pagecache can come from anywhere.
So if you have 500MB of slab and 100MB of cache in lowmem, but
10000MB cache in highmem, lowmem pressure should be shrinking
more cache than slab.
