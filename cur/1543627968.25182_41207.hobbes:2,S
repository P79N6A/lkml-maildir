This seems right.  I was skeptical because it is very easy here to rely
on some implicit behavior that is not at all defined.  I cannot think of
anything wrong with your approach - good.

Oh, this is indeed a problem.  But perhaps the bigger question is, why
does not double_rq_lock disable interrupts like task_rq_lock?  You are
right about rq_lock vs. interrupts - thus interrupts must _always_ be
disabled when holding a runqueue lock.
The only other code that uses double_rq_lock is init_idle, which
correctly disables interrupts.  Maybe it is wise to just make
double_rq_lock disable interrupts?  If not, at least a comment above the
code: "must disable interrupts before calling!".
Also, this is almost certainly the cause of the preempt race in
set_cpus_allowed.  I knew it was not kernel preemptions fault!
