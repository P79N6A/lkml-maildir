    That was my confusion: I forgot that the i386 does segmentation
AND paging. Thanks for the help :) I've taking a look at a book that
I had gathering dust (maybe 8 years...), by Douglas V.Hall. I must
take a really *deep* read into it and other i386 documentation before
getting in this kind of conversations O:)). Thanks again for your help.
