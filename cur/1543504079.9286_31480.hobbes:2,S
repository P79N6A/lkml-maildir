Not up to me - I'm not the one in need of it. RedHat 6.0 upgraded to
kernel 2.2.10 does everything I currently need...

The patches in question are NOT currently under consideration for the
distribution kernel, at least not as I understand it. Basically,
various people have implemented various patches that enable the kernel
HZ rate to be set to various speeds other than 100 Hz, and have made
their patches available for downloading on various sites. However, as
I understand it, the various patches are (A) incompatible with each
other, and (B) largely untested other than by the author.
However, I understand that those patches have brought to light certain
other kernel problems which have been fixed as a result...
Best wishes from Riley.
