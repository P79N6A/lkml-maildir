Cool. This has been on my todo list forever.
However I'm not sure 256 is a good number. It seems a bit too high.

Did you measure this prefetch makes a difference? I would expect it to
be too soon to be really worth while (normally you need hundreds of
instructions for them to make sense and that's probably not the case here)

Putting it at the end is also not good because there are the rarely used
cachelines. Probably better in the thread structure
