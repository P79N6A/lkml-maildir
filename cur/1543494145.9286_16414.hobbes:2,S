Hi!
I found some problem on all boxes I tested (with kernel from 2.1.132 to
2.2.6 -- I didn't try 2.2.7 yet) with shaper.
When I insmod shaper and attach it to any ethernet device (doesn't
metter which one) and send ping with large size (for example: 
ping target -s 64000) the linux box responds to any other packet with
about 6 to 20 seconds delay. Doesn't metter that I do send only 2 64k
pings (semms to be some defragmentation problem, 'cos it appeared only if
I enabled masquaradinf and defragmentation). I only need to send few such
packets and whole box seems to be faar away. When I send normal size pings
it responds after 6 to 20 seconds or later.
After that, all tcp connections that were established before are working
OK. All new one needs to wait about 6 to 20 seconsds to be established. If
I'll restart ipchains rules (ipchains -F) everything starts to work well
(until I'll try to send large ping again ;).
This computer was set up as a masquarading box.
I'm not shure whethet it is known, but I reproduced it several time (on
one computer with 6 ethernet devices) on few different kernels. I did it
on the ethernet, so I'm not shure whethet it works for a long distans.
