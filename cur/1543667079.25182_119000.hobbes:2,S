    Just one point: while with kernel sources the space saving is
notable using .bz2 instead of .gz, in my experience with different
files, formats, etc... the saving is negligible and the speed just
sucks, gzip beats bzip2 for me in general.
    Anyway I think bzip2 is standard nowadays.

    IMHO, just the decompression speed. I've made no tests, but if
the kernel sources behave like other archives I have, .gz is faster.
OTOH, you save a few megs for downloading, and this is *very*
important too.
