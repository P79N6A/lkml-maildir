I kind of like the idea of not releasing the pid when someone is using it.
However with my trivial hostile program I can with 32 or 33 living processes
each with 1000 references to dead processes I can completely saturate the
default pid map.  And it won't be obvious why alloc_pidmap is failing.
Your resource consumption with the extra hash table is higher than
mine at until very high process counts.
In addition it doesn't really help with the problem that inspired
this work.  That of having multiple pid spaces.  I could make it work
by throwing a pspace reference in struct pid_ref, but without some
fancy footwork it would prevent cleanup until all of the outside
references are gone.

So I kind of like it but I don't feel it does as good a job solving
the problems I am solving.  
In this instance I'm not at all certain I like having NULL ref
pointers.  It increases the number of cases you have to deal with when
reading back the pid, but that is minor and something task_refs suffer
from more than pid_refs.
