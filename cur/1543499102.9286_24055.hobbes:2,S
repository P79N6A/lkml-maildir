I am having trouble with an IDE cdrom drive and 2.2.10
it will not mount a cd...
2.2.9 worked fine.. both kernels were running on redhat 6.0
when i try to mount it it sits there liek this:
[21:01:12] root@pandora:~# mount /cdrom/
mount: block device /dev/hdd is write-protected, mounting read-only
and sits there and sits there..
all kernel configs havent changed..
kernel identify's cdrom as:
hdd: NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:273, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdd: ATAPI 4X CD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache
mounts version:
[21:04:27] root@pandora:~# mount -V
mount: mount-2.9o
any ideas?
