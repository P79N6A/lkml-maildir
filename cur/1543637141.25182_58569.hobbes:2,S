The problem is a common one for complex statement-like macros.
You have a macro M consisting of (in this case) two statements
S1 and S2: "#define M S1; S2". Now consider what happens when
M is used in non-block context, i.e. not as a top-level
statement between { and } but rather in e.g. the true branch
of an if-statement:
	if (condition)
		M;
which after preprocessing becomes
	if (condition)
		S1; S2;
However, indentation doesn't matter, only grouping does, so this
USE of the macro really is
	if (condition)
		S1;
	S2;
Now do you see? The macro body was broken up, and the second statement
is now executed unconditionally.
The traditional approach is to write the body of a complex macro as a
do { ... } while(0) statement (i.e. #define M do { S1; S2; } while(0))
since this turns the macro body into a single unbreakable statement
which is safe to use in any context where a statement may occur.
Simply wrapping the macro body with a pair of braces { } doesn't work
in all contexts; the do{...}while(0) idiom does.
