In this particular case Wu had asked about postgres numbers, so I 
reported some postgres numbers. You could probably get similar speedups 
out of postgres by implementing readahead in postgres. OTOH, the kernel 
patch also gives substantial speedups to thing like cp; the question 
comes down to whether it's better for every application to implement 
readahead or for the kernel to do it. (There are, of course, other 
concerns like maintainability or whether performance degrades in other 
cases, but I didn't test that. :)
