The discussion has been most complete, I guess at this point is you
can't fix the sender to stop this anti-social behaviour, you might try
using iptables to "mangle" the PSH off from this host or rate limit the
ACKs, or some other hack. None of which is a "solution," just some
interesting things to try.
As noted, the core problem is that TCP doesn't like really asymmetric
bandwidth.
