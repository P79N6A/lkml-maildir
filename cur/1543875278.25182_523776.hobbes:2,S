Probably due to use of:
#define NS_TO_JIFFIES(TIME)	((TIME) / (1000000000 / HZ))
#define JIFFIES_TO_NS(TIME)	((TIME) * (1000000000 / HZ))
Excuse our 64bit world while we strive to correct our 32bit blindness and fix 
this bug.

It should far more accurately represent the cpu usage without any userspace 
changes.
