The first two are not for me to decide.  They look fine code-wise,
but IIRC Roman had some issues with wether the condition should be
possible at all.
The third one is where I requested a respin, and I'm pretty sure I've
seen a version with some improvement over the one in your tree.  Let's
get the latests version back on -fsdevel and review it again.
The one in your tree certainly is not ready.
