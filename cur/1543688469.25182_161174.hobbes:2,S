Yes the cifs vfs code was using current->pid in multiple places and in 
about five of the places the meaning
really was process id,  and thus presumably better to change this to 
current->tgid.   I have made the change
from pid to tgid for those places in the bk tree for the cifs vfs 
(
http://cifs.bkbits.net/linux-2.5cifs
) and will try them out.
The locking tests needed to be rerun anyway.
