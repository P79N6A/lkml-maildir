But you can trivially run an executable via e.g.:
    /lib/ld-2.3.4.so some-nice-proggie
and the execute permissions (and noexec, etc) on some-nice-proggie don't
matter.

It makes their running a bit harder, but not much.

Right. But this is a broken idea, IMVHO.
Besides, something that has been overlooked in all this discussion so far:
It does routinely happen that fixing some "just an ordinary bug" really
does correct a security problem. Plus backporting "only security fixes"
gets harder and harder as they start depending on other random changes.
