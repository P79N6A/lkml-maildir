I got side tracked by a customer with money :)  The fold is fine with me, but I 
would like to know what went in.
By the way, in my looking at the network link stuff, I started wondering if it 
could not be done without modifying the card stuff.  Here is what I see:
The poll routine just calls the interrupt handler.  We only need the address of 
that routine and a generic poll function to do the indirect call.  That address, 
once the link is up, can be found in the interrupt tables using the irq.
I haven't looked in detail at where we might find the address earlier, but I 
suspect it may be possible.
There is an issue around when we can start talking to gdb.  I am not sure when 
the net cards are initialized, but it is after memory is available from the slab 
manager.  I am not sure what else needs to be up, need help here.  I keep 
finding myself wondering about a small memory manager to allow the network card 
to come up a bit sooner (like first C code).
We would also need to arrange to have the needed network parameters at that 
time, but we can do this using the CONFIG stuff, then override with command line 
if that is desired.
Thoughts and hints are welcome.
