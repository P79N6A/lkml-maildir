Since this is really homework, you really should ask these questions
to your teacher or a teachers assistant.

enqueue_task_head only puts the task at the front of it's prio queue.
If next is higher in priority than task (as it probably is since it was
picked) than next will be queued again.

It hangs because you keep scheduling next (it's has the highest prio)
but you keep setting need_resched, and thus it goes into the scheduler
an infinit amount of times.
