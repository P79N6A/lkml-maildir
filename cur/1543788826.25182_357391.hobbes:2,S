Thanks Arnd
If I have understood correctly the following would be the changes I
would have to make in the kernel...Please correct me if I am wrong.
It seems to me step (d) would be as you say a little tricky but I
could attempt it
depending on the amount of time I have in the project I am on at the moment.
Proposed modifications...
a) Struct file_operations(include/linux/fs.h) has a compat_ioctl hook for file
ioctls. Include a compat_proto_ioctl hook in proto_ops(include/net.h) for
modular socket ioctls.
b) socket.c has a 'file_operations' type struct socket_file_ops where the
.compat_ioctl member is currently not used. Define compat_sock_ioctl in
socket.c and assign to .compat_ioctl member of socket_file_ops
This is ifdef'd with CONFIG_COMPAT
c) compat_sock_ioctl will by default call the protocol's ioctl
 currently supporting the socket interface when handling modular socket ioctls,
like so. socket->ops->compat_proto_ioctl(...)
which in this case is x25_compat_ioctl.
d)If compat_sock_ioctl has to perform a function similar to
sock_ioctl(socket.c)
where in SIOC* commands are handled, then introduce a newly defined
compat_dev_ioctl that would have stuff like dev_ifsioc that would have
previously
been removed from fs/compat_ioctl.c.
Then the protocol's ioctl (called by default in the step c above) would itself
default to compat_dev_ioctl ensuring other socket layer
ioctls are handled by the device layer function, compat_dev_ioctl
regards,
Shaun
