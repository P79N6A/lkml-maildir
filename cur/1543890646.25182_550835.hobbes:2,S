If I didn't misunderstand the idea is that no caller will face an
-EOPNOTSUPP in future. IOW every layer or driver somehow makes sure
the right thing happens.

Seems there are at least two assumptions about what the semantics
exactly _are_. Based on Documentation/block/barriers.txt I understand
a barrier implies ordering and flushing.
But regardless of that, assume the (admittedly constructed) following case:
You got a linear target that consists of two disks. One drive (a)
supports barriers and the other one (b) doesn't. Device-mapper just
maps the requests to the appropriate disk. Now the following sequence
happens:
1. block x gets mapped to drive b
2. block y (with barrier) gets mapped to drive a
Since drive a supports barrier request we don't get -EOPNOTSUPP but
the request with block y might get written before block x since the
disk are independent. I guess the chances of this are quite low since
at some point a barrier request will also hit drive b but for the time
being it might be better to indicate -EOPNOTSUPP right from
device-mapper.
