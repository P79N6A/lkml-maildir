Subject: Not Initialize the shrinker->list after kmalloc() in mm/vmscan.c(V2.6.12)?

Dear all:
I am reading the function set_shrinker() in mm/vmscan.c of V2.6.12, and I
have a question about the not initialization of list_head,
/*
 * Add a shrinker callback to be called from the vm
 */
struct shrinker *set_shrinker(int seeks, shrinker_t theshrinker)
{
        struct shrinker *shrinker;
        shrinker = kmalloc(sizeof(*shrinker), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (shrinker) {
	        shrinker->shrinker = theshrinker;
	        shrinker->seeks = seeks;
	        shrinker->nr = 0;
	        down_write(&shrinker_rwsem);
	        list_add_tail(&shrinker->list, &shrinker_list);
	        up_write(&shrinker_rwsem);
	}
	return shrinker;
}
As above, the shrinker is allocated from kmalloc, coming from slab
allocator,the list in shrinker is not initialized, directly list_add_tail()
to shrinker_list, don't need to INIT_LIST_HEAD(shrinker->list)?
Thanks,
Best Regards!
