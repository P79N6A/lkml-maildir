But the in-kernel swsusp stuff (looking at the current linus kernel now)
does write each page to the swap in a sync manner. That definitely is
pretty slow, I would not be surprised if Nigels numbers are correct. If
you repeated without write back caching enabled, a factor 10 in slowdown
as compared to async io would not surprise me.
Why don't you split the writeout into a few seperate loops? Step 1,
submission, step 2, wait for completion, step 3, check for io errors.
You could even collapse step 2+3 if you wanted, the important bit is to
queue all the io first.

If you keep writing single pages sync, you sure as hell wont get
anywhere near async io in speed...
