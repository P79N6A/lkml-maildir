Do NOT do this.  The fact that this works should tell you something ..
that Linux is being told to "halt" not "power off"!
To fix this, you need to edit your shutdown script (/etc/init.d/halt
on Debian, /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt (?) on RedHat, similar on others)
and make sure that the "halt" in there has the "-p" switch.
Calling "halt" with -p from any run level except 0 (and 6?) will
just run shutdown (and the -p switch is not propogated).
By the way Debian (what I use) already has the -p switch in its
halt script - so I have not problem.
Cheers,
Stephen
