	The primary reason I like GID (or, based on your later arguments, a
UID) based role system is that administration of capabilities is centralized.
Just a personal preference, and it helps me with my old-fashioned 
``what is user X up to'' as opposed to ``what is program X up to''
system administrator mindset.

	Excellent reasons why GID based role systems are bad. Let's go up
a level - why not a UID based role system, then? A UID based system would,
IMO, take care of problem (1) since capabilities are assigned to a single
user, (2) since the UID gives positive ID and allows for ``least privilege'',
and (3) it becomes a manditory control, if I understand that phrase
properly.

	Had CC become practice yet? What are some good examples that I
can look at? (UNICOS? Trusted Solaris?)

	When did this 16 group limit on NFS/NIS come up? I've been using 
large-group NIS (over 60 groups!) for over two years, on Solaris and
Linux, and NFS mounts, without any problems...

	The UNICOS UID<->Capability role system - that I like. Can it be
implemented without the PAL on the inodes? Ie: (snipped from an offline
discussion I'm having)
My (so simple it's probably braindead) concept for UID-based roles:
(for the purpose of the following, CAP_CAPUPDATE allows modification
 of the kernel capability<->UID mapping table, and CAP_SUIDOTHER
 allows marking inodes SUID if you don't own them)
        a) Use the capabilities as defined by the kernel
        b) Bind (via init(1)) capability masks to UIDs
        c) Only process id 1 has CAP_CAPUPDATE, which allows it
           to read /etc/capabilities and update the kernel
           with that information. (userful after adduser)
        d) By default, a file executed by a UID runs with
           a capability mask of 0
        e) The only time that capabilities are used is when
           an executable that is NOT writable by group or other
           AND marked SUID is executed. The executable then
           gets the capability mask of its owner's UID.
        f) Said process can then drop capabilities if needed.
        g) Said process cannot regain dropped capabilities,
           nor can if assign itself new ones.
        h) Only UIDs with CAP_SUIDOTHER (ie, ``classic'' root)
           can SUID an inode that doesn't belong to them.
    Seems to be dead-simple to me. You have a bunch of
``pseudo-users'' that own critical programs, ie:
        http    httpd, apacectl, etc
        login   login,xdm, etc
        console setleds,loadkeys, etc
	Everything else just stays the same.
