Every task (process) has its own stack which can be as large as
necessary. It grows down towards the user data.
When a user calls the kernel, the kernel code switches to
a 'kernel stack' which is a separate stack and there is a
different one for each and every task on the system. Since,
with thousands of tasks, there will be thousands of kernel stacks,
it is essential to make the kernel stack as small as possible.
In the ix86, this has meant either 1 or two pages of PAGE_SIZE
length (0x1000 currently).

All code that executes in the kernel must use the stack that has
already been allocated for it. If you have code that cares about
the size of the kernel stack, the code is broken. If you have
an array, allocated in the kernel, that's longer than a few
hundred bytes, you use kmalloc() or other kernel allocators
for that array.

Stacks are never resized and, in fact, this isn't a Unix/Linux
thing, it's just never done because it's stupid and, if necessary,
is used to cover up something equally stupid, like excessive
recursion.

You don't.
