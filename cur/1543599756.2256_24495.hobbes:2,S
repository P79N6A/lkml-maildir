The lock-up occurs even if there is no PC card in the slot.  In its most
verbose mode, lspci reports no other PCI device using IRQ5, so I'm fairly
confident it's not an IRQ problem.  I'm further convinced of this because
the PCMCIA slot works perfectly if I hack cardmgr to ignore socket 0
(which has no physical slot attached) and only initialize socket 1 (which
is the one card slot on the PCI card).

David
