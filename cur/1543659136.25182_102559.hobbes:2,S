Intel seperate out things that are docmentation errors, clarifications
and actual bugs. They publish regular errata documents listing these,
and when they do decide to turn a flaw into a specification update they
document that too. AMD likewise.
Some vendors may not do this, but the x86 CPU vendors seem to do a good
job.

It depends on your chip revisions. For example the O(1) scheduler will trigger 
very occasional random crashes or reboots with early PII Xeon microcode sets.
I'm sure Debian has a package for this somewhere.
