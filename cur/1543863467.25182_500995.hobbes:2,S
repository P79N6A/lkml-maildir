I was running into this yesterday - turns out that Debian's current
smbfs package contains a patch that checks for user passed options,
and disables unix capabilities in that case. It was added in
3.0.14a-4. I've filed a bug requesting the removal of this patch:
  
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=408033
Grant: Do you know if are you running a version of smbfs w/ this
       patch?
