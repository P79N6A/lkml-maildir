Okay. Thanks for sheding some light here. :)
I'm still not sure that trademarking RTLinux is good, as the use of
such a generic name would make forking difficult. 
I.e. If it were cold YodaLinux-Real-Time(tm) and I didn't like the
development direction, I could make a fork called FooBarLinux-Real-Time
and all would be good.
With the width of trademark enforcement today, I might hae a hard time
producing 'Real-Time Linux' or 'LinuxRT' or even 'Greg's RTLinux' from
RTLinux.
Not that I would fear a developer doing something so rude, but with
coperate buyouts, shareholders, etc. Uncreful trademarking could have a
chilling effect on open software development.
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance or something along those lines.
