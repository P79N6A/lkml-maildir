The perfctr kernel extension (not yet merged) calls
cpu_set() from a function invoked via smp_call_function(),
relying on cpu_set() being atomic.
I can take a spinlock there, but it seems ugly when an
atomic set_bit would suffice.
Also, may I request that when changing a fundamental aspect
of the semantics of an operation, you also change its name?
That way, unconverted code will get a compile or link error
rather than breaking at runtime.
