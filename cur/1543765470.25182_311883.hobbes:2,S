And of course if I take care of making them consistent... What I'd like 
is stability. Not in the sense of having a rock-stable kernel, that of 
course is already there. I'd like API stability, if API stability is 
achieved, ABI is there.

No. I have compiled everything from scratch, every single package. Now, 
every vanilla kernel brings the problem of recompiling modules for that 
particular version.

Applying a patch to 2.6.11 making it 2.6.12 brings one thing: all 
modules external to the vanilla kernel are no longer there and I have to 
recompile them every time...

The global feeling about kernel is that it seems that you don't care 
about the purpose of your task, which of course is not the kernel by 
itself. It can't be. It's about what it does (and already does it well), 
and what it provides to third-parties: the kernel and the API given to 
the outside world, since the kernel is not alone... and will never be of 
course! ;)
