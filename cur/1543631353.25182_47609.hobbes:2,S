^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Because read() may *consume* its input, while memcpy() it's only a copy and
leaves the source intact (if you care not to overlap src and dst).
If you're read()ing from a serial line with 1-byte fifo you want to
know how many chars you read successfully in the first place, since
once read, they're gone. SIGSEGVing won't help in re-reading the chars.
