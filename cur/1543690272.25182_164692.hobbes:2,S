One common problem I saw with the original netconsole patches
was that the low level drivers' poll function was grabbing the 
driver spinlock, but the driver would otherwere do printk
with the spinlock hold (->easy deadlock) 
Does your patchkit handle that?
I worked around it in some drivers by not grabbing the lock
in the direct access poll path, but it's a bit ugly.

P.S.: Also what would be really nice for netconsole
would be "kernel ifconfig" similar to what the nfsroot code does. 
With that it would be actually possible to use it as a full console 
replacement.
