	Ok...  Here's one back to you.
	I went to build 2.2.0pre2 on several systems including a Pentium Pro.
The PPro configuration blew up with this compile error:
] chaos:/usr/src/linux# make bzImage
] gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/u/src/linux-2.2.0pre2/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686  -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
] /u/src/linux-2.2.0pre2/include/asm/bugs.h: In function `check_config':
] In file included from init/main.c:27:
] /u/src/linux-2.2.0pre2/include/asm/bugs.h:354: `smp_found_config' undeclared (first use this function)
] /u/src/linux-2.2.0pre2/include/asm/bugs.h:354: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
] /u/src/linux-2.2.0pre2/include/asm/bugs.h:354: for each function it appears in.)
] make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1
] chaos:/usr/src/linux#
	Reconfigured to 586/K5/5x86/6x86 and it compiled fine.  Reconfigured
back to PPro/K6/6x86MX and it blew up with the same error.  This is a UP
build.
	Pentium/TSC configuration also builds fine.  PPro/K6/6x86MX with SMP
also builds fine.  It's just the PPro/K6/6x86MX UP that cooks.
