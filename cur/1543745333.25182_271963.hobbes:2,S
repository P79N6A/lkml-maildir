Hello
I've been running until now 2.6.3 without problem. I had a test 2.6.7 
kernel with reiserfs debugging enabled, and indeed it is running slow. Now 
I compiled 2.6.9 without reiserfs debugging, but it is still slow... In 
the attached tarball dmesg outputs plus configs for all 3 kernels. "Slow" 
means just running top alone in a vt it takes 1.6% CPU. Under 2.6.3 it 
takes 0.2% (Duron 900MHz). Another peculiarity with 2.6.7 and 2.6.9 is 
that the power LED is blinking with about 1Hz frequency. It's an ASUS 
A7VI-VM motherboard. In the manual there's nothing about error-codes. I 
played with various APIC settings - no change. Related or not - if running 
with LAPIC enabled (2.6.7), I get quite a few ERR in /proc/interrupts.
Any idea?
If not - will start compiling and testing different kernels. Does Reiserfs 
(3) now always do debugging?...
Thanks
Guennadi
