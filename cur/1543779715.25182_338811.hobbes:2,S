OK I did the following:
 find arch -name "*.c" ! -type d | xargs grep  "update_process_times" |grep -v user_mode
arch/arm/kernel/smp.c:  update_process_times(user);
arch/um/kernel/time_kern.c:     update_process_times(CHOOSE_MODE(user_context(UPT_SP(regs)), (regs)->skas.is_user));
arch/sparc64/kernel/smp.c:                      update_process_times(user);
arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c:         update_process_times(user);
arch/alpha/kernel/smp.c:                update_process_times(user);
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:         * update_process_times() expects us to have done irq_enter().
arch/x86_64/kernel/apic.c:       * update_process_times() expects us to have done irq_enter().
arch/sparc/kernel/sun4d_smp.c:          update_process_times(user);
arch/sparc/kernel/sun4m_smp.c:          update_process_times(user);
I also did a find without the -v user_mode and here's some of the output
(filtered to only show what's relevant):
arch/arm/kernel/time.c: update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
arch/sparc64/kernel/time.c:             update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
arch/m32r/kernel/time.c:        update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
arch/alpha/kernel/time.c:               update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c:                update_process_times(user_mode_vm(regs));
arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c:      update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
arch/sparc/kernel/pcic.c:       update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
So all but (amusingly) user-mode-linux use the user_mode macro. So it
does look good. I'm not too worried right now for user-mode-linux, but
that sould be fixed too if need be.
So I'll add this to the patch I'll be sending you soon (after it's all
tested).
