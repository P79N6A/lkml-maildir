Often removing half the ram, running a kernel compile, see if it
segfaults, then repeat with the other half of ram is much faster and
more reliable than memtest.  memtest just doesn't have the same random
accesses while keeping the cpu underload as a kernel compile does.
Personally I just don't bother with memtest anymore.  The only thing it
tells you is that you have errors or that you might have errors but it
didn't find them.  It never tells you that you do not have errors and it
often does miss that you have errors since marginal memory is more
likely to fail under cpu load it seems which memtest doesn't do.
