Apparently Marvell's driver accesses PCIE configuration registers through
I/O ports specific to their hardware:
/*
 *	Macro PCI_C()
 *
 *	Use this macro to access PCI config register from the I/O space.
 *
 * para:
 *	pAC		Pointer to adapter context
 *	Addr	PCI configuration register to access.
 *			Values:	PCI_VENDOR_ID ... PCI_VPD_ADR_REG,
 *
 * usage	SK_IN16(IoC, PCI_C(pAC, PCI_VENDOR_ID), pVal);
 */
#define PCI_C(p, Addr)		\
	(((CHIP_ID_YUKON_2(p)) ? Y2_CFG_SPC : B7_CFG_SPC) + (Addr))
...
			/* clear any PEX errors */
			SK_OUT32(IoC, PCI_C(pAC, PEX_UNC_ERR_STAT), 0xffffffffUL);
			SK_IN16(IoC, PCI_C(pAC, PEX_LNK_STAT), &Word);
			pAC->GIni.GIPexWidth = (SK_U8)((Word & PEX_LS_LINK_WI_MSK) >> 4);
...
			SK_OUT8(IoC, B2_TST_CTRL1, TST_CFG_WRITE_ON);
			SK_OUT16(IoC, PCI_C(pAC, PEX_DEV_CTRL), Word);
			SK_OUT8(IoC, B2_TST_CTRL1, TST_CFG_WRITE_OFF);
...
		/* clear the interrupt */
		SK_OUT32(IoC, B2_TST_CTRL1, TST_CFG_WRITE_ON);
		SK_OUT32(IoC, PCI_C(pAC, PEX_UNC_ERR_STAT), 0xffffffffUL);
		SK_OUT32(IoC, B2_TST_CTRL1, TST_CFG_WRITE_OFF);
But sky2 uses standard pci_read_config_*, pci_write_config_* functions,
which require working MMCONFIG access.  Maybe sky2 should be changed to
use I/O space for access to PCIE-specific configuration registers.
