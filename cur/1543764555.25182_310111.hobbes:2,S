Subject: [2.4] "Fix" introduced in 2.4.27pre2 for bluetooth hci_usb race causes kernel hang

Hello.
I have noticed a problem with a race condition fix introduced in
2.4.27-pre2 that causes the kernel to hang when disconnecting a
Bluetooth USB dongle or doing 'hciconfig hci0 down'. No message is
printed, the kernel just doesn't respond anymore.
Seen in Changelog:
Marcel Holtmann:
  o [Bluetooth] Fix race in RX complete routine of the USB drivers
Reversing the following patch to hci_usb_rx_complete() makes 2.4.27-pre2
up until 2.4.30 happy and does not hang when removing the dongle
anymore. (bfusb.c has the same patch applied)
2.6.11.7 does not show the same problem, but has similar code to the
"fixed" (that hangs) code in 2.4, so the real problem is probably
somewhere else.
I have tested this on Dell Optiplex GX150, 260 and 280's which has Intel
P3 and P4 with Intel UHCI USB chipset. I have tested both usb-uhci.o and
uhci.o with the same results. Tested with USB Bluetooth dongles with
both Broadcom and Cambridge Silicon Radio chipsets, same results.
