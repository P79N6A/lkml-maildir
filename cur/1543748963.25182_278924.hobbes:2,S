Well, the TSC is a terrible time source. Currently when interpolating,
the error between the TSC and the PIT allows for time inconsistencies. 
When using it as the sole timesource, accurate calibration does become
much more important, because we do accumulate the error.  However, NTP
or other methods of correcting for poor calibration or drift could be
used. 
I realize not everything can use NTP, but George Anzinger has some code
that would use the PIT to measure and adjust the TSC frequency values.
Unfortunately I haven't gotten around to looking at it yet.

Yea, my code currently doesn't have cpufreq hooks, but the cpufreq
notifier would act as an interrupt which would save off the accumulated
time at the old frequency and update the time source with the new
frequency.

I agree. Fixing the irq handler is right solution.
