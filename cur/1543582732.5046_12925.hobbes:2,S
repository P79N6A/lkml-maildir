Its only normally invisible. Mark Hemment pointed out there is currently a
race where if both cpus go to fill in the same entry the logic goes
	CPU1					CPU2
	pgd present 				pgd present
	pmd not present
	load pmd
						pmd present
						Explode messily
The race looks right to me since both CPU's can be running from the same
mm.
The obvious fix (removing the 2nd check) of course hangs the WP check. I
have a hack [not for Linus grade] for that now but really need to walk as
far as the pte in the racey case to check for a WP fault.
