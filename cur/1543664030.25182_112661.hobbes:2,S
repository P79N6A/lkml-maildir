	In the past, one could rebuild symbol versions with the faster
step of "make depend".  It's fine if you want to combine code
generation and generating symbol information in one step when all of
the .o's are being built, but it would be nice to still have the
ability to just update the symbol information.  I'm not necessarily
volunteering to add this (but who knows), but I'd like to know if
there is some reason why this couldn't be added to the current kbuild.
