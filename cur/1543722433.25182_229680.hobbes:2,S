Hi,
can anyone explain what is the difference between the following two pieces
of code.
1. if (!pskb_may_pull(skb, sizeof(struct iphdr)))
                goto inhdr_error;
   iph = skb->nh.iph;
2. if (!pskb_may_pull(skb, iph->ihl*4))
                goto inhdr_error;
   iph = skb->nh.iph;
Also, does anyone know how the headers are stripped from the packet at the
receiving end. Does the function __pskb_pull_tail() strip of the header fields ?
Thanks,
Rahul.
