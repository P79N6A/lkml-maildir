Well, we certainly do not want to see artifacts leaved behind cursor,
which is what 2.6 currently does. (Type something in bash, backspace
over it).
Making it behave like it does now with 2.6, but with cursor properly
deleted after after backspace, it would be okay.
[It should behave the same way on 2.4 vgacon and fbcon... with
possible difference that "bright background" might cause characters to
blink on vgacon. That depends on vga card setting and is not really
important.]

Were you able to reproduce it?
