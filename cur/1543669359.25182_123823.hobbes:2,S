Hi Dwaine, I don't understand your email too well, sorry.  Many USB devices
take a while before they are usable, because first you need to load some
firmware into them.  MOD_INC_USE_COUNT will not slow down initialisation.
It is to do with unloading the driver, and stops the driver being unloaded when
it would be dangerous to do so.
All the best,
Duncan.
