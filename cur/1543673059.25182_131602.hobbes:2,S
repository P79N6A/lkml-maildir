Hi,
While tackling bug 699, it became clear to me that irq balancing is the cause 
of the performance problems I, and all people using the SMP kernel Mandrake 
9.1 ships, are dealing with. I got the problems with 2.5.69 too. After 
disabling irq balancing, the system is remarkably faster, and much more 
responsive. 
For those interested in the issue, please look at bug 699.
