As well as helping memory hot-remove, it provides a known lower-limit that
the hugepage pool can be resized to at runtime. Grouping pages by mobility
on its own does not give a known number of pageblocks that could be used
for hugepage allocation. On it's own, it provides a high probability that
the hugepage pool can be grown but how large depends on the workload. With
the zone, an administrator can set aside X amount of memory that can be used
for hugepages if necessary and base pages otherwise.

The memory unplug patches already migrate pages without the help of memory
compaction. Memory compaction needs a bit more work before I try sending
it towards -mm for wider testing. It's important to get right because
with compaction, the migration code is getting a lot more exercise than it
does today. However, memory compaction needing more work should not hold
back memory unplug nor does it impact on the utility of grouping pages
by mobility or the movable zone.

The number of scenarios that cause fragmentation have dropped over time.
It's something I see as constantly improving over time.

Thanks Christoph for your reviewing of the code, your comments here and the
quite rigorous exercise of the anti-fragmentation code. I too believe
there are performance gains to be had through the use of larger pages
and working on this does not preclude work on improving the use of base
pages.
For larger pages to be used though, external fragmentation has to be
addressed in some fashion and no other viable implementation exists
besides anti-fragmentation right now.
