Was it ever established what the intended audience
of this press release was?  e.g. what magazine's
readership is it aiming at: 
Newsweek, www.news.com, Computer Shopper, or ...?
Maybe we should have two press releases - one for
general interest publications, one for nerd city.
I'd be happy to have a writer friend massage it
if we want a press release intelligible to the
average nontechie user.
