I used 2.3.22 no problem for a while.  I ran ps to check for a running
daemon, since it woudl not respond (it was not running) was curious
about other processes and did a ps ax ... this forced the shell to
logout.  Switched consoles...  since it did not reset.  And logged in as
root, no problem, executed ps ax again, same result.
Switched to another console (again, woudl not reset to login) and
instead of running ps ax this time I tried an ls just to humor myself.
This time same result, logout.  Tried logging in as a normal user on yet
another console and got an oops in cron.  Reboot.  Tried it again, only
second time running ps ax the system spit too much to read too fast and
then rebooted.
Other ps tools work fine, and I haven't had a `normal` ps commandline
cause this.  The fact that init is having problems makes me wonder if
this is a memory problem?
I've done an strace on ps ax, it works fine.  Trying it a second time it
fails and strace reports a missing process (as if it had dissappeared)
and then performs the forced logout.
I can provide whatever info you feel is relevant.
(i figured teh actual oops output would be irrelevant since it didn't
seem in any way directly related to ps ax, and teh fact it was cron, if
it is, let me know).
