Okay, I commented out those lines and compiled a new kvm-82 userspace
and kernel modules. Using those on a vanilla 2.6.28 kernel, with all
guests run with -no-kvm-irqchip added.
As before a number of the XP guests wanted to chug away at 100% CPU
usage for a long time. Three of the guests clocked up ~40 minutes CPU
time before I decided to just shut them down. Perhaps coincidentally,
these three guests are the only ones with Office 2003 installed on them.
That could be the difference between those guests and the other XP
guests, but that's probably not important for now.
The two Linux SMP guests booted okay this time, though they seem to only
use one CPU on the host (I guess kvm is not multi-threaded in this
mode?). "hermes-old", the guest I am pinging in all my tests, had a lot
of trouble running the apache2 setup - it was so slow it was difficult
to load a complete page from our RT system. The kvm process for this
guest was taking up 100% cpu on the host constantly and all sorts of
wierd stuff could be seen by watching top in the guest:

Running the ping test with without apache2 running in the guest:
--- hermes-old.wumi.org.au ping statistics ---
900 packets transmitted, 900 received, 0% packet loss, time 902740ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.568/3.745/272.558/16.990 ms
And with apache2 running:
--- hermes-old.wumi.org.au ping statistics ---
900 packets transmitted, 900 received, 0% packet loss, time 902758ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.625/25.634/852.739/76.586 ms
In both cases it's quite variable, but the max latency is still not as
bad as when running with the irq chip enabled.
Anyway, the test is again not ideal, but I hope we're proving something.
That's all I can do for tonight - should be ready for more again
tomorrow night.

Kevin.
