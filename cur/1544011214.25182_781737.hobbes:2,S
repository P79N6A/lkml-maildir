With your hint I figured out that put_io_context() isn't sufficient and 
I should also call exit_io_context() instead of the latest 
put_io_context(). Thanks!

Unfortunately, it would be very non-optimal. As it is known, to achieve 
the best performance with async. IO, it should be submitted by a limited 
number of threads <= CPU count. So, the only way to submit IO from each 
of, e.g. 100, clients in a dedicated per-client IO context is to 
dynamically switch io_context of the current threads to io_context of 
the client before IO submission.
