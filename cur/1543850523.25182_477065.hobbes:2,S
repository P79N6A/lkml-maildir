Subject: x86-64 with nvidia MCP51 chipset: kernel does not find HPET

I have a 6 month old x86-64 machine with nvidia MCP51 chipset on which
the kernel does not detect the HPET.  According to HPET maintainer
Clemens Ladisch, this machine certainly has one, but it cannot be
enabled for lack of hardware documentation.
Is there anything I can do to help debug this?
