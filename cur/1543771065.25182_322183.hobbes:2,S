  Actually I just wanted to write Andrew to include the two one-liners
that fix the real bugs (the patches will follow soon). I have the bigger
patch splitting the checkpoint lists but that is certainly not a 2.6.12
thing. And this bigger patch needs the two one-line fixes anyway.
I'll elaborate more in the mails with the patches...
