According to drivers/char/defkeymap.map:
ScrollLock (keycode 70) -> activates scroll lock
either shift key + ScrollLock -> calls Show_Memory (=alt-sysrq-m)
left Alt + ScrollLock -> activates scroll lock
right Alt + ScrollLock -> calls Show_Registers (=alt-sysrq-p)
either control key + ScrollLock -> calls Show_State (=alt-sysrq-t)
This happens whether you have magic sysrq support compiled into your kernel
or not.
