FreeBSD adopted devfs because it solves very real problems. I dont think
the BSD developers are stupid. They reasoned it out and came to the same
conclusion that Richard Gooch came to : devfs *is* useful.
And in any case if you disagree with devpts so vigorously, just dont
compile it into the kernel.
Pretty simple actually.
