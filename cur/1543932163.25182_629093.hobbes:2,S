Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI fixes for 2.6.24-rc5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Here is a single PCI fixes against your 2.6.24-rc5 git tree.
It reverts a previous patch that caused some problems with some
machine's expansion roms.  The proper fix for this will be in the next
release, so for now, let us restore the previous functionality so we do
not break any machines that were previous working just fine.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
