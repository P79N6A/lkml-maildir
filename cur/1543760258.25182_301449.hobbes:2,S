Subject: Exuberant ctags can tag files names too

Exuberant ctags can tag file names too. I find this extremely useful
when browsing kernel source, and so would like to share it with
everyone. (You can now type ":tag oprof.c" for example, and jump to the
file with that name.)
I previously sent a patch which naively just appended an "--extra=+f" to
the ctags line. Here's a much smarter patch that works by first
querrying if ctags is exuberant, and if so, whether the --extra
functionality is available before adding the line. Please apply.
