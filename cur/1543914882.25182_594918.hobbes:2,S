Regarding "Linux Kernel developers," false.  _I_ have posted.  ath5k, 
wireless, and net driver maintainers have all sent emails.  License and 
code fixes have been committed.
As for the FSF:  It has been repeatedly stated that the FSF has zip to 
do with this.  Nothing.  Nada.  Zero.  Zilch.  Linux != FSF.

You are failing to observe that changes have been made in response to 
criticism.
Given that Linux Kernel devs have responded both with code changes and 
emails, "silence" and "inaction" are provably false.
And since the changes go ath5k->linville->me->linus or 
ath5k->linville->me->davem->linus, I am a step in the approval chain.  I 
do know what I'm talking about.  :)
