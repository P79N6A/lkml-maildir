That is an orthogonal problem to kbuild 2.5.  The spaghetti that is the
include tree needs to be cleaned up, other people are working on that.

Since release 2.0 [1], kbuild 2.5 has been faster as well as more
accurate than the old build system.  A couple of people have complained
that some restricted operations are slower in kbuild 2.5 [2] but
overall it is faster, more accurate and provides more facilities,
especially for people building multiple kernels.
