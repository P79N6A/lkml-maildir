Ok, I found it: actually it is the PAUSE opcode in the P4 instruction set,
and the doc for PAUSE mentions that it is equivalent to a NOP on older
IA-32 processors.
So no black magic here, except that "rep;nop" is a bit misleading, since
the Intel docs for REP and NOP do not mention PAUSE...
Thanks all for you help.
