It works fine for my Synaptics with default resolution, I don't have
ALPS to try but I think Peter tried to make it behave similarly.
Still, I agree that relying on the screen coordinates is a bad idea.

Why is that having 5x better resolution is considered broken? And how
synaptics should "make them reasonable"? Driver emits pretty much raw
coordinate values and it is up to the consumer to make sense of them.

Yes, because there are other things we can do in that special code. Do
you like default tochpad sensitivity? What if someone does not? Do you
like verical and horisontal scrolling? Circular scrolling?
multi-finger tappng (synaptics only)? Corner tapping? What about
rebooting every time you change an option?

Well, your code will make my touchpad (Synaptics) go ballistic. It
really has resolution of about 4000 points across.
