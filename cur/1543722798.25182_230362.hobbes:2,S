Sorry for the noise, it also happens with -staircase.
Lets remake the question.
I start /usr/lib/xscreensaver/glmatrix -fps, and the frame rate starts at
25 fps. In 30 seconds it has dropped to 6 fps. The app is still using 
the same cpu time (about 90% of one cpu on a dual xeon box with ht).
Any ideas ?
