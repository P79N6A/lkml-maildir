Hum, I'm surprised this caused a freeze - you are sure this fixes your
problem?  This flag is never checked anywhere in the dock code, and if
it's not set, it will not matter, it will still do the undock.  The
flags file is exported to user space via sysfs though, so maybe because
the flag isn't being set, some user space script is doing something it
shouldn't?  The patch does seem correct though, so might as well add it.
