Yes.  It *might* work if you don't PROT_SEM the page the semaphore is
on, but it's still a bug waiting to happen.  OTOH, it'd be nice if
PROT_SEM returns EINVAL was a reliably indicator of no futex support.
This way you actually need to call the futex syscall once to see if it
works.
Cheers!
Rusty.
