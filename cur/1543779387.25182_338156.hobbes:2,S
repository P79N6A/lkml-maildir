Hi,
This card use the sata chip pdc 40718 (as of my card)
the lastest sata_promise kernel with sata promise patch driver doesn't 
recognise
this card.
I added the following line to static struct pci_device_id 
pdc_ata_pci_tbl[]  in sata_promise.c:
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_PROMISE, 0x3d17, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0,
          board_20319 },
and the card was recognised and seam to work without errors so far.
bilding a soft raid5 on it and moving data doesn't broke it.
It would be interesting to hear from the guru's if this is ok to do?.
Otto
