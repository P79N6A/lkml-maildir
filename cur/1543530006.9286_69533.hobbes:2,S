With a copy of GCC built for cross-compilation running on a different
architecture (and possibly running something other than Linux, but why?).
Consider Linux for Merced was probably bootstrapped without the help of a
"native" OS as it was originally running on simulators before the chip was
even available. 
The kernel can only be built with GCC. Unfortunately, ANSI C is missing a
few things that are critical to making a high-performance kernel, most
importantly inline functions and inline assembly. Linking pragmas are
becoming increasingly important as well. So we're forced to break with
portability between compilers. Not generally a problem, as GCC is very
widely ported. 
I'm not much of a PowerPC maven any more, so I don't know what's different
between the "G3" and "G4", but I suspect for kernel code the optimization
possibilities are pretty limited and involve hand-tuning anyway so simply
using another compiler isn't going to buy much.
