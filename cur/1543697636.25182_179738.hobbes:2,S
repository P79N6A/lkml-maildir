Yeah, I think Richard may be right.  Anyway, the drive sort of reads
from the raw partition.  It gets a IDE reset and then it reads.  I can
read it a second time with no reset.  Haven't tried a reboot between
reads, hang on, yeah, a reboot brings the errors back.
But, fscking the dd-ed image gets me less errors so I'm trying that 
route to get the data back.
