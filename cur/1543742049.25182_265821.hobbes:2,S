That was the last piece.  It also fixed up some odd bugs when it was
done.
Do we really want drivers to go back to have to declare the pci config
space themselves if they want to?  What does that buy us?
I agree that Ben's comments are valid, but the recent patch doesn't
change anything that wasn't already being done.
