Here's what I expect is happening:
In the /bin/blah case, bash has a fully-qualified command
name to work with, so it doesn't have to do a path search.
Rather, it proceeds directly to doing a stat or open on the
file which for some reason fails with an EPERM (I'm not going
to argue whether that's right or wrong without perusing the source).
In the second case, bash must do a path search, so it does
stats on /path/blah for every path in your PATH. Since those
all fail, it prints that fact - i.e. command not found. Two
different mechanisms resulting in two different but understandable
error messages.
I think the argument could be made either way. Some might
see this as two completely different scenarios, since one
involves a path search and one doesn't. Others might expect,
as it seems you do, that the base of the "problem" is really
the same, so the error messages should be the same. I can't
say as I really have a strong opinion either way. But I
figured it might help if we understand from whence cometh
the difference...
