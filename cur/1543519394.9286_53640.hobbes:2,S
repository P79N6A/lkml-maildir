Hello,
I have some problems using an IBM Travelstar disk with a Jumptec
DIMM PC.  My setup is as follows:
 IBM Travelstar 25GS (DARA-225000) (/dev/hdb)
 SanDisk SC414379PU3 IDE Controller 
 AMD Elan SC410-66 CPU
 16 MB flash ROM with IDE-interface (/dev/hda)
 Kernel 2.2.13 
 gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
The problem is that it seems like the Linux kernel is unable to
properly detect that particular disk, some times it says:
hdb: probing with STATUS(0x40) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x50)
and other times it is able to detect the disk, but the identification
string from the disk is garbled, and the geometry information is
screwed up.  The BIOS is not able to detect the GS25 either.  I have
tried the disk on other computers, and everything seems to work fine
on those.  Therefore I suspect that the problem is caused by the
SanDisk IDE controller.
The IBM Travelstar 14GS (DCYA-214000) works flawlessly on the same
board.  I have checked the timing specifications on both the 25GS and
the 14GS and they seems to be identical on the electrical interface.
Does anyone have any thoughts on what could cause this problem?
I have an option on using a separate IDE controller, but I hope
this problem could be solved by altering the ide-probe code.
