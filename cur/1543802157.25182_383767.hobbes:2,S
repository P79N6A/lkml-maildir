It would be nice to know which part of the usb-handoff code causes the 
problem.  In the 2.6.15 source file drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c, at the 
end of the file is this routine:
static void __devinit quirk_usb_early_handoff(struct pci_dev *pdev)
{
	if (pdev->class == PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_USB_UHCI)
		quirk_usb_handoff_uhci(pdev);
	else if (pdev->class == PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_USB_OHCI)
		quirk_usb_handoff_ohci(pdev);
	else if (pdev->class == PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_USB_EHCI)
		quirk_usb_disable_ehci(pdev);
}
If you comment out the call to quirk_usb_handoff_uhci and rename the 
/lib/modules/2.6.15/kernel/drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.ko file so that it 
doesn't get loaded automatically, does that fix things?
Similarly, if you comment out the call to quirk_usb_disable_ehci and 
rename /lib/modules/.../ehci-hcd.ko so that it doesn't get loaded, does 
that help?
Leonid's system log showed that he doesn't have an OHCI controller, but if 
Martin does then he should do the same test with quirk_usb_handoff_ohci.
