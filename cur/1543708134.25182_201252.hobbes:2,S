Thats taking me back a few years - IIRC this was originally added
because mkfs.xfs zeroes out the last N KB of the device before it
goes on to creating the XFS filesystem.  Waaay back (~3 years now?)
there was a problem when someone had, say, a 4K block size ext2 fs
on the device - mount/unmount of that left the device block size at
4K in the kernel, when mkfs.xfs then came along it would not be able
to zero the last small-amount-less-than-4K of the device (on devices
where the size was not 4K aligned only - heh, that was a fun wrinkle)
and mkfs would see write-past-end-of-device errors.
No idea if that can still happen in 2.6, I imagine it can in 2.4
where we originally saw the problem.

At least for some older kernel versions this was needed - possibly
still is, I'm not sure.
cheers.
