This is my bad with some sysfs updates I did recently to scsi. The patch
will make you compile, but the to_scsi_host is host.h does not return the
same data as the previous to_scsi_host in edd.c did if class_data is not
set. Though the "sh" variable is never used in the function
edd_find_matching_scsi_device. I will look over this function some more
and send mail to the list / Matt as to what else might have broke.
