Okay. I was under the impression that it wasn't good to have more than one bit 
of information per file in sysfs.

Pardon me for saying this, but... I don't actually care about them. It's the 
fact that MIT is a *huge* college and likely has money to pursue license 
issues and similar, and the BSD license, IIRC, states that the code is 
"Property of the Board of Regents" of, IIRC, UC Berkeley. UC Berkeley is 
again, a rather huge college, and has the resources to pursue license issues.
For that reason alone I am going to try to keep any code I produce clean. I 
could care less if BSD or an MIT OS project use the code - I'm writing it for 
Linux.
