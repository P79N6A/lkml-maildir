So, that means that DSFS runs on userspace? (We can't see the source
so it'd be nice to know how DSFS works)
Also, I'm curious about this piece of code on your patch:
ftp://ftp.soleranetworks.com/pub/dsfs/datascout-only-2.6.9-06-28-05.patch
-		printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: module license '%s' taints kernel.\n",
-		       mod->name, license);
+//		printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: module license '%s' taints kernel.\n",
+//		       mod->name, license);
I mean, nvidia people also use propietary code in the kernel (probably
violating the GPL anyway) and don't do such things.
