Hi all
    I've a server with 2 Operton 64bit CPU and 12G memory, and this server 
is used to run  applications which will comsume huge memory,
the problem is: when this aplications exits,  the free memory of the server 
is still very low(accroding to the output of "top"), and
from the output of command "free", I can see that many GB memory was cached 
by kernel. Does anyone know how to free the kernel cached
memory? thanks in advance.
Sincerely,
Ashley
