   However, the state as designed is basically generic to ANY half duplex
   line discipline and, as a result, would be best implemented as a core
   module for half duplex disciplines, with the individual disciplines
   hooking into it.
That's fine, as long as all of this gunk isn't in each individual
low-level tty driver.  The phrase "the serial port will provide" is what
set me off --- this is something that's specific to the line discpline
state management, not the serial driver.  I think we're in violent
agreement; it was just the wording that made me worried.
