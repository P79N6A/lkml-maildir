ah, interesting. Since you have CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG enabled, could you 
please try to figure out what the best value for 
/proc/sys/kernel_sched_latency, /proc/sys/kernel_sched_nr_latency and 
/proc/sys/kernel_sched_min_granularity is?
there's a tuning constraint for kernel_sched_nr_latency: 
- kernel_sched_nr_latency should always be set to 
  kernel_sched_latency/kernel_sched_min_granularity. (it's not a free 
  tunable)
i suspect a good approach would be to double the value of 
kernel_sched_latency and kernel_sched_nr_latency in each tuning 
iteration, while keeping kernel_sched_min_granularity unchanged. That 
will excercise the tuning values of the 2.6.23 kernel as well.
