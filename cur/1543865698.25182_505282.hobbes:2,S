Uh, would it?  Are you talking about handing off the *task_struct*  
that it was submitted under to each worker thread that inherits the  
stack?
I guess I hadn't considered going that far.  I had somehow  
constructed a block in my mind that we couldn't release the  
task_struct from the submitting task.  But maybe we can be clever  
enough with the task_struct updating that userspace wouldn't notice a  
significant change.
Hmm.

I, too, totally agree.  I didn't even approach the subject for  
exactly the reason you allude to -- I wanted to get the hard parts of  
the kernel side right first.

Haha, well, yes, of course.  You couldn't have thought that the dirt- 
stupid sys_asys_wait_for_completion() was anything more than simple  
scaffolding to test the kernel bits.

You picked a weird struct to highlight here.  struct asys_input seems  
more related to the stuff you go on to discuss below.  This asys_call  
struct is a relatively irrelevant internal detail of how  
asys_teardown_stack() gets from a fibril to the pre-allocated  
completion state once the call has returned.

I strongly disagree here, and I'm hoping you're not as keen on this  
now -- your reply to Matt gives me hope.
As mentioned, that they complete out-of-order leads, at least, to  
having separate submission and completion rings.  I'm not sure a  
submission ring makes any sense given the goal of processing the  
calls in submission and only creating threads if it blocks.  A simple  
copy of an array of these input structs sounds fine to me.
When I think about the completion side I tend to hope we can end up  
with something like what VJ talked about in his net channels work.   
producer/consumer rings with head and tail pointers in different  
cache lines.  AFAIK the kevent work has headed in that direction, but  
I haven't kept up.  Uli has certainly mentioned it in his 'ec' (event  
channels) proposals.
The posix AIO list completion and, sadly, signals on completion need  
to be considered, too.
Honestly, though, I'm not worried about this part.  We'll easily come  
to an agreement.  I'm just not going to distract myself with it until  
we're happy with the scheduler side.

Hmm, indeed.  Some flags could let userspace tell the kernel not to  
bother with all this threading/concurrency/aio nonsense and just  
issue them serially.  It'll sound nuts in these days of cheap  
syscalls and vsyscall helpers, but some Oracle folks might love this  
for issuing a gettimeofday() pair around syscalls they want to profile.
I hadn't considered that as a potential property of this interface.
