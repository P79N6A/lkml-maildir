This is rather good news.  I was staring at about 200-300 MM patches
wondering which one was buggy.  Thanks heaps for doing the bisect.  Now the
main worry is Randy's dead box.
A lot of Greg's driver tree has gone upstream, so please check current
mainline.  If that's OK then we need to pick through the difference between
2.6.21-rc7-mm2's driver tree and the patches which went into mainline.  And
that's a pretty small set.

hm, big mess.  Could be it was some glitch from Tejun's sysfs changes which
are all being extensively redone, so perhaps we'll never hear from it
again.  Or perhaps we just merged it into mainline.
