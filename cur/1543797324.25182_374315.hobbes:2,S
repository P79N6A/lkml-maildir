This is a grave oversimplification of how it would work.  Look at sound
hardware, vendors come out with new devices so fast that it would be a
full time job to keep that ALSA wiki 100% accurate.  At least half the
bugs that users report aren't real bugs.  There are gazillions of small
variations of the same device.  Vendors are deceptive at best and lie
through their teeth at worst.  A "Sound Blaster Live! SB0410" could use
a COMPLETELY different and VASTLY inferior chipset to a "Sound Blaster
Live! SB0350".  They release two devices with identical PCI ids but
different hardware.  And they don't tell us word one about their plans.
Often the users know a lot better than the developers do what devices
are supported to what degree.  Etc.
If we followed your scheme 95% of supported hardware would be listed as
broken.
