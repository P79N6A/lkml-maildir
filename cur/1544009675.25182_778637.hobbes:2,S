I still have a long unused Amiga around.  However, it has not been
graced with Linux yet, has no network device, the harddisk wasn't
sounding very happy the last time I ran it those many years ago and that
probably didn't improve.  So I might be able to test it myself, but it
would take time to set up.

Yes, it should be.  I came back to Linux kernel development only in the
recent months and totally missed these kind of locks.  I'll prepare a
new patch later.
