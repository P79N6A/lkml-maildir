Dmitry, I don't see the effect of your patch. I.e., both the patch by 
Arjan referenced in the bug, and combination of that patch with yours, 
produce a working mouse and this dmesg output:
psmouse serio1: ID: 10 00 64<6>elantech.c: Elantech version query result 
0x00, 0x01, 0x64.
elantech.c: Probably not a real Elantech touchpad. Aborting.
input: ImExPS/2 Logitech Wheel Mouse as /class/input/input18
