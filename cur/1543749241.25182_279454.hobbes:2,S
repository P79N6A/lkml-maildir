Okay, I'm about to send that.  By the way, while going through my 
original patch, I noticed that one of its changes to drivers/char/moxa.c 
was incorrect.  Line 671 of the original used a fixed 30 second timeout. 
  My change replaced that to use closing_wait but I got the name of the 
variable wrong; it should have been 'ch', not 'info'.  My split-off 
patch doesn't change moxa.c.
