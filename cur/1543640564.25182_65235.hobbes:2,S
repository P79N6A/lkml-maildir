his problem sound a lot like mine.. never going further than Ok, booting the 
kernel. my chipset is a i845g.
it looks like the problems start with 2.4.19-pre7 which shows exactly this 
problem.
2.4.19-pre6 still works.
from the changelog pre6 to pre7 :
<wim@iguana.be> (02/04/07 1.383.2.6)
	[PATCH] 2.4.19-pre6 i8xx series chipsets patches
<wim@iguana.be> (02/04/07 1.383.2.7)
	[PATCH] 2.4.19-pre6 i8xx series chipsets patches
<wim@iguana.be> (02/04/07 1.383.2.8)
	[PATCH] 2.4.19-pre6 i8xx series chipsets patches
could this be the root of the problems ? Jens ? could you check please if you 
can boot pre6 and pre7 ?
