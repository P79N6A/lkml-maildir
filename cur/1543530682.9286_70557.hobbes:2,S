Subject: Reiserfs as root? 2.3.99-pre1

I decided to migrate a test system to 100% reiser fs.
/tmp, /var, and /usr went fine. They run great.
/boot is being left as ext2 (It's smaller then the reiserfs log, and
normally mounted read only).
After copying root to a reiserfs volume and pointing the kernel to it, I
see it get mounted fine, then the system hard locks after the "Freeing
memory" message. This is booting with init=/bin/bash
Any suggestions?
