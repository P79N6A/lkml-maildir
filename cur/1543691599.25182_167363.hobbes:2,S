Dear Sir,
SOLICITING FOR A BUSINESS VENTURE AND PARTNERSHIP
Before I proceed, I must be grateful to introduce myself. My name is Mr. Joseph Taylor a 
Liberian. I am the first son of President Charles Taylor, the president of liberia . During the 
rebellion in my country, I absconded under my father's instructions with Twenty-Eight Million 
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$28.5M) which was part of the money meant for 
campaigning for President Charls Taylor re-election into office.
Presently I have been able to move the funds diplomatically to a Financial Vault Company in 
Europe where it is still kept in safe custody.
MY REQUEST
As a result of my present situation as a refugee who cannot have access to own an account or 
accounts, I am looking for a trustworthy individual/firm by my father's instructions to advice us 
in making the rightful investment as well as to provide account(s) where the funds will be lodged 
into. More also, we are at the interim interested in buying properties for residence as my family 
will be residing there in the near future.
COMMISSION/REMUNERATION
As regards your commission/remuneration, my family have decided to offer you 25% of the total sum 
and also set aside 5% for all your expenses (i.e telephone bills, travelling expenses, hotel 
bills and other miscellaneous expenses).
I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this and other business ventures will 
derive a huge success hereafter and it will be a long lasting business association via my email 
for further breifing.
I await your anticipated co-operation.
Yours truly,
Mr. Joseph Taylor.
