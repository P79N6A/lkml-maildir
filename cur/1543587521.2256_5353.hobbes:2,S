Subject: I can eject a mounted CD

My fstab:
/dev/cdrom              /mnt/cdrom              iso9660
noauto,user,ro           0 0
/dev/cdrom              /mnt/cdmac              hfs    
noauto,user,ro           0 0
I insert an apple cd (hfs) and mount /mnt/cdmac
If I type eject /mnt/cdrom the cd momes out but
df shows it's still mounted:
/dev/sr0                667978    667978         0 100% /mnt/cdmac
It's funny it don't let me eject cdmac
[Giu@Jay Giu]$ eject /mnt/cdmac/
umount: /dev/sr0 is not in the fstab (and you are not root)
eject: unmount of `/dev/sr0' failed
Bye.
