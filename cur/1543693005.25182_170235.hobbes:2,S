Subject: libata support for Adaptec 1205SA?

I need to add some SATA ports to a system, not RAID, just plain SATA 
ports. I've found the SIIG SC-SAT212 which is based on the Sil3112A 
chip, but may not fit in my low-profile case. There is also the 
Adaptec 1205SA which already is a low-profile card, but I can't seem 
to find any information on the 'net as to which chip it uses.
Does anyone here know, and more importantly, is libata ready to 
support it? I want to build a 6-drive SATA RAID using software RAID 5 
(can't just the expense of a 3ware card for this application), so I 
need to add four ports to the two already present on an ICH5 on the 
motherboard.
