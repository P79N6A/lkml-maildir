I stand by my assertion that anybody who develops kernel
modules in C++, including MIT students, is arrogant.
Let's see if C++ is in use in the kernel. At one time, some
of the tools that came with it were written in C++ (like ksymoops).

Well, perhaps the kernel developers were ignorant. They didn't
write anything in C++. Maybe they were just too dumb to learn the
language?
Maybe there is another reason:
The kernel development languages, as previously stated, were
defined at the project's inception to be the GNU C 'gcc'
compiler's "C" and extensions,  and the 'as' (AT&T syntax)
assembler. Anybody can search the archives for the discussions
about using C++ in the kernel.
Any person, or group of persons, who is smart enough to
actually write some kernel code in C++, has proved that
they are not ignorant. Therefore, they have demonstrated
their arrogance.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
