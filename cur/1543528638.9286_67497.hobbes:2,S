As far as I know, initrd _is_ fixed.  Funny thing: B. D. Elliot and I
both posted workarounds for the problem, and you didn't even comment.
Now you blurt "People, will it EVER be fixed?".  Color me unimpressed.
WRT (your) boot problem: If you're good enough to add syscalls to the
kernel, you're good enough to sprinkle printk's around and at least try
to see where it hangs.  Posting diagnostic info might lead to resolution
of your problem whereas posting sarcastic comments certainly will not.
