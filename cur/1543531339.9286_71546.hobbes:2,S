Hello, I recently installed a Lava PCI Dual Parallel port card in my SUSE
Linux system and I'm having trouble getting it to see my HP CD-Writer and
SyQuest Sparq drive via the two new ports.  The logs say that the kernel
sees the 2 new parallel ports but not the peripherals attached to them.  Any
help?  I'm running the 2.2.14 kernel.
