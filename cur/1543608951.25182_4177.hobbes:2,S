Hm, while still on the default RH7.2 kernel using ext3 on all partitions I 
flicked the reset switch accidentally (wrong reset switch it was...) and 
when coming back up it fscked (I didn't touch anything - didn't even notice 
any 5 second thing but I wasn't looking at this screen) and it found two 
lost inodes (I got two entries in lost and found). So it still needs to 
fsck by the looks of it?
