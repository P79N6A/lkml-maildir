This hasn't been an absolute requirement. There have
been 32-bit Unix implementations that gave separate
4G address spaces to the kernel and to each user
process.  The only real downside to this is that
copyin()/copyout() are more complex. Some processors
provided special instructions to access user-mode
addresses from kernel to mitigate this complexity.
