Only the latter. I've _seen_ traditional, pre-Linux man pages; while they  
were great compared to, say, DOS help (which didn't even exist at the  
time), they weren't much compared to what a typical Linux distribution  
has. They certainly didn't have a concept of portability ("What, you want  
to use other vendor's offerings?!"). The best you could expect was, very  
seldom, some kind of hint about USD-BSD differences.
Traditional Unix didn't have the market of M$, but they sure had a lot of  
the attitude.
