acpi_fan_suspend should probably set state to ACPI_D3, rather than ACPI_D0.
With this change the fan works after S3 suspend atleast on HP nw8000 laptop,
for which the suspended fan has been broken since sword-and-stone.

Why this was ACPI_D0 beats me, but it's been that way since
the _suspend/_resume functios got added in the commit
0feabb01d93e5801d1127416a66cfc3963280bca (2.6.18-rc1, I think).
The fan hasn't worked on my HP nw8000 laptop after an S3 suspend
ever, but fixing that to ACPI_D3 there finally makes it work as
expected.
If there was some hidden reason why that was set to ACPI_D0,
then perhaps a config option for some ICH4 or HP laptops
is called for.
