Pardon my ignorance, but what is this AS iosched ?

I'm not entirely sure if that proves something or not,
as the whole (interrupt & hang) problem seems to exist
only with HPT374 and not with any other version of the chip anyway.
I do personally have one mb with a 372-chip and it has always
worked just fine with this same driver (perhaps its harder
to detect the problem with only two disks?).
