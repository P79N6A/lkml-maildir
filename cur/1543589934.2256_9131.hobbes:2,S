	> Define 'direct sockets' firstly.
	Direct Sockets is the ablity by which the application(using sockets)
can use the hardwares features to provide connection, flow control,
etc.,instead of the TCP and IP software module. A typical hardware
technology is Infiniband . In Infiniband, the hardware supports IPv6 . For
this type of devices there is no need for software TCP/IP. But for
networking application, which mostly uses sockets, there is a performance
penalty with using software TCP/IP over this hardware.

	The application needs to rewritten to use VIPL, but if we could
provide a sockets over VI (or Sockets over IB), then the existing
applications can run with a known environment.

	My point is that if the hardware is capable of doing TCP/IP , we
should let the sockets layer talk directly to it (direct sockets). Thereby
the application which uses the sockets will get better performance.
