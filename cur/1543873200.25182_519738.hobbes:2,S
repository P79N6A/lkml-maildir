That's actually a larger goal, but for the immediate future, I figure
this would be a good first step.  Start out by stating what's similar,
and then build off of this for something bigger.  But in the mean time,
we can have a staging ground for work that's for both i386 and x86_64
archs. And for those that know these systems in a more intimate way
(Andi :) they can work off of this to make that monster.
