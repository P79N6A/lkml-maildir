This is a very rarely used instruction. People either do
plain old rep stosl or do 3DNOW or SSE2 non-temporal stores.
Maybe movnti is different (buggy?) in subtle way.
Does it blow up if you use 3DNOW or SSE2 non-temporal stores?
If yes, then try different BIOS (not nesessarily latest is best).
BTW, 'Athlon bug' was tracked down similarly. New BIOS enabled
buggy chipset feature - BOOM! non-temporals killed the box
(took several months to figure it out back then).
