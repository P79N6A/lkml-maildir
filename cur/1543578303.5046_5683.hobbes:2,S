I tried this: apparently no effect. However, there may be hardware
issues involved (see below).

I tried this: Reading the entire image never caused any crashes.
However, I did have some (rare) instances of the kernel booting
successfully. Then it would fail again, booting the very same image
that had worked before.
I am beginning to suspect that I may be dealing with flaky hardware.
(I'm working from home today and I only have access to one of my 386
specimen here).
I guess I'll better shut up until I can double check on
some other 386 boards tomorrow....
In the meantime, it would be helpful if anyone who has successfully
booted a 2.4.0 kernel on a 386 could report this to the list.
