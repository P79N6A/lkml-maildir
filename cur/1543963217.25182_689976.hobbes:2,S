How long have you been doing kernel development?
How about you read SubmittingPatches a few times before you show just how 
clueless you are?
Hint: look for the string that says "From:".
Also look at the section that talks about "summary phrase". You got it all 
wrong, and you don't even seem to realize that you got it wrong, even when 
I told you.
