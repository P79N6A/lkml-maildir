| Everything is right. The indent only goes from "1" to "2" [see above], 
| "3" to "4" is called

Thanks to all of you for answering. Actually I was concerning about function
arguments' alignment (on separated lines) not about indentation. So as I see
it's a question of bent ;) And a simple rule exist - use tabs for indents
and spaces for alignment (when amount of spaces are < 8).
