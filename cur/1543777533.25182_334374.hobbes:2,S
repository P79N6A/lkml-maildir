Subject: [PATCH] generic_file_sendpage

This is a generic sendpage() for regular files.
With generic_file_sendpage() it is possible to use sendfile() on file 
targets, instead of only sending data to sockets.
This implementation is basically an extension of Joern's original patch 
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109455958522766&w=2) but 
is honoring signals. I also removed some unnecessary code: no IOVs, no AIO.
