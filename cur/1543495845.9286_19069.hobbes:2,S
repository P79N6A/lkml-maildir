I'm looking for information about these errors. They are defined in
kernel includes but I can't find what they are for and why they are
returned.
I need some general information to be able to translate those error
messages in the glibc catalog. What is an exchange?
I'm also looking for information about ENOTNAM and ESTRPIPE.
