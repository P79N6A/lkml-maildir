For however useful defragmentation may be to make speculative use of
physically or virtually contiguous memory more probable to succeed, it
can never be made deterministic or even reliable, not even in pageable
kernels (which Linux is not). Fallback to allocations no larger than
the kernel's internal allocation unit, potentially in tandem with
scatter/gather capabilities, is essential.
