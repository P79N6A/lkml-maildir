Jeff, he's trying to go incremental, the idea is to make the union
something like ->i_fs_private (void pointer) or something like that, or do
like I did for the struct sock case, using a per fs slabcache, to avoid the
extra allocation for the private area, Al thinks that this is not needed,
but Daniel thinks it can be worth it, doing it incrementally we can test
both approaches and avoid getting to big a patch. But yes, the idea is to
kill the union completely and remove all the fs specific includes in fs.h.
After the access to the union is abstracted, we can do the next step, which
is to remove the union, touching then only the function/macro that
abstracts the access to the fs specific data.
So, yes, the ext2 stuff will be removed, as all the other fs specific stuff
