Yeah, I'm not saying I think it's a good process flow for people to
implement.  But if they want to, they now can.
The main reason for this is for drivers that replace built in drivers,
or multiple modules for the same device (think of new rev of driver,
both loaded at once, some devices should bind to the new one, other
devices you want staying with the old one due to it controlling your
root partition.)  Now userspace has a chance to unbind and bind devices
to drivers in those situations, which it never could before.
But remember, I'm not changing the way things bind to devices here, like
requiring userspace to pick the driver for the device, so no one lives
will change at all, if they don't want to.
Hope this helps explain it.
