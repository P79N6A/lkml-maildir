Such systems you do need to run with notsc - although 2.6 autodetects
this prints complaints and does the job itself.

Are you trying to use tsc for delays or measure CPU speed. The original
question you asked was about CPU speed and the two are very different.

If you are trying to do tsc stuff remember tsc synchronization between
processors is not guaranteed and works on most boards today as a quirk
of design.

Presumably they use the other timers that Apple designed into their
hardware as they control both ends. You've got a good 48Khz or so clock
in the audio device too so many games clock off the audio clock anyway.
