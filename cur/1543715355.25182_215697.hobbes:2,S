Better yet, file a bug and we'll look at your ehci interrupt issue in
detail.

How to file a bug against ACPI:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
For failure and success case, please attach
1. dmesg -s64000, or serial console using "debug" on cmdline.
  (increase CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT if it doesn't get back to beginning)
2. /proc/interrupts
3. lspci -v
Please attach the output from acpidmp, available in /usr/sbin/, or in
pmtools:
