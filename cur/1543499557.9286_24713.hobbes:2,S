Most of these do not run out of inetd, for performance reasons.  And
several systems have wrappers for this sort of thing anyway.
innd has the inndstart program, which runs as root, binds the port, then
becomes user news and loses all privs.  There is a similar wrapper for
sendmail, though not many ppl use it.
