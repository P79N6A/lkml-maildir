Let really good. I applied it to my local tree but haven't passed it to BK 
fbdev yet. The only thing I like to see changed is get_EDID. At present it 
accepts a struct pci_dev. Now for generic support for the intel platform 
we can get this from the BIOS. You already have a patch that does this. 
It doesn't need a struct pci_dev in this case. It is possible to get this 
info from the i2c bus but I never seen any drivers do this. What data would
we have to pass in get the EDID inforamtion? So the question is how 
generic will get_EDID end up being or will we have to have driver specfic 
hooks since I don't pitcure i2c approaches being the same for each video 
card. Petr didn't you attempt this with the matrox driver at one time?
