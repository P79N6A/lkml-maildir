Hello Daniël,
(the follwing is made with 2.4.23:)
at first I want to thank you again for helping me to debug this bug.
After you left irc, i continued to debug, with the following results:
First, I need to enable CONFIG_FB_ATY_GENERIC_LCD. But I dont need 
to patch it. around the hack for Geerts notebook.
Second, I need to enable "Video Expansion" in system bios.
(At lower resolutions, video is expanded to cover the entire LCD)
If I dont enable Video Expansion, the 640x480-60 and 800x600-60
resolutions are broken. Repairing by pressing Fn-F5 is possible,
though. In that case booting with video=atyfb:1024x768-8@60 helped
to get at least that resolution working.
Have a look at my debugging logs 10.log - 16.log at
http://www.rootdir.de/files/atyfb/.
 
regards, claas
