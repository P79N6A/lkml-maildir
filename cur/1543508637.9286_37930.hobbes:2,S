I was looking into how security levels are implemented in linux and I
stumbled on what I think is a bug.
An immutable file can still be touched to change its date. I'm not really
sure if immutable should prohibit that but I think so (since you can't
change permissions on an immutable file) and I think it should.
I traced it to sys_utime() and sys_utimes() in fs/open.c and patched it
there. But after seing directories turning into files (spooky) i tried
again and patched inode_change_ok() in fs/attr.c.
Oh, and a question: does linux even *have* security levels? I assumed it
did since it has immutable files but people say it doesn't have it.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
This patch works for me but am sure Linus will beat me silly for patching
absolutely wrong.
