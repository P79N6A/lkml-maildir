the machine only has 4G of ram and you've an huge zone-normal, so I
guess it will offset not more than 1 point percent or so.

are you saying you force _all_ people with >4G of ram to use 4:4?!?
that would be way way overkill. 8/16/32G boxes works perfectly with 3:1
with the stock 2.4 VM (after you nuke rmap).

how? just curious.
