It should be noted, mainly for russell's benefit, that the ->irq_ack() 
hook is only called if a debug define is manually enabled in libata.h, 
in a single callsite.
The number of people that actually use the hook -- kernel hackers 
debugging screaming interrupts -- can probably be counted on one hand.
