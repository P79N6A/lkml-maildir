The point would be that old user land just works without any changes.
I know that is a virtue that has gone out of fashion recently
with udev and sysfs, but older distributions that weren't
that sysfs-layout-of-the-week dependent used to be fairly kernel version
independent.  I always found that very useful.
The hda->sda move would be the only "radical" change that prevents booting for
a long time (the last one before that was the 2.5 modutils transition)
