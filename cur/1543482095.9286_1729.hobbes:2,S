I'm glad it's safe now but not being able to run 'ps' when heavy swapping
is occuring, and not being able to run 'vmstat' to see how things are
going is pretty terrible, IMHO...  Those are the times where getting
process information is most important.  
The problem is centered around the call to read() from /proc/NNN/stat.  
I'll look at the changes and see if I can understand what you are
referring to, but I'm really not in a position to provide any help here
except as 'user' feedback :-(  The VM's up to pre7 had seriously impressed
me, and now even sending SIGTERM (by PID, not even using 'ps first) to a
process seem orders of magnitude slower.  
Thanks for the explanation,
David
