Hi Linus, Alan.
The Linux Kernel Version History page that I've been developing
appears to be as complete as I can make it at the moment, so here's a
status report thereon...
 1. Kernels numbered 0.* appear to have several gaps. Judging by the
    dates in the tarballs available, the following are missing:
	0.02 through 0.09
	0.13 through 0.1x (at least two versions, maybe more)
	0.95b
	0.95c
	0.96d
	0.97.1 through 0.97.5
	0.97.7 through 0.97.? (one or more versions)
	0.98.7 (did it exist? Not more than one here)
 2. Kernels numbered 1.0.* appear to be complete up to 1.0.9 but
    versions above that appear not to exist. Were there any?
 3. All kernels from 1.1.0 upwards are listed.
For reference, the relevant details are as follows:
    Web URL:
	
http://ps.cus.umist.ac.uk/~rhw/kernel.versions.html
    AnonFTP URL's used:
ftp://SunSITE.org.uk/Mirrors/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
*
		(UK Mirror of ftp.kernel.org site)
	
ftp://ps.cus.umist.ac.uk/pub/rhw/Linux/
*
		(Tarballs not on above site)
If ftp.kernel.org would like to grab the extra tarballs I've collected
that weren't on their site, they're welcome to do so...
Best wishes from Riley.
