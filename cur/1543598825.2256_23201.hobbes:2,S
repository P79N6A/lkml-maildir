Cannot install diald 0.99.4 in RedHat 7.1/ 2.4.3-12. I want to use
my Linux Server as a gateway/firewall to the Internet for my other
PC'S using a dial on demand 56k modem (ppp0)that hangs up after
timeout of no use. How do I install the diald daemon into the 2.4.3
kernel? is there a better way to do this gateway using a modem?
Any advice would be appreciated.
