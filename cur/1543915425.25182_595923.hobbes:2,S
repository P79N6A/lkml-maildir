And none of those issues are a factor at all in ath5k (which spawned 
this sub-discussion), or indeed many other drivers.  The above code you 
cite is -generic-, hardware agnostic code.
Most new hardware is MMIO-only, making ioread32() only for drivers that 
care about legacy IO support, something that is being slowly phased out. 
  e.g. legacy IDE, legacy 10/100 mbps ethernet NICs with the dual 
MMIO/PIO register spaces.
