rather than fixing up the gazillions of existing BUG()'s we have
littered through the tree, maybe we could default to current behaviour
if no argument is passed ?
Failing that, resurrecting the k_assert() idea someone proposed
(jgarzik?) a few months back.
One reason for doing this would be to make it less painful for people
writing drivers that compile on 2.4/2.6
