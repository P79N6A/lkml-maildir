I think that is a good idea more support to Toshiba Laptops, so 
omnibook+toshiba_acpi is a perfect couple, because some functions works 
with toshiba_acpi and others works with omnibook.
Jaime (in cc too) do a very useful module that work in some laptop 
models that not work on toshiba_acpi and omnibook driver.
So, I think that is a very good idea all work together to do a more 
powerful (and compatible) module in next kernel releases.
