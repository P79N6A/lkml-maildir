I'm using now again a second computer with a single USB keyboard through 
an USB switchbox. Switching between computers is equivalent to connect 
and disconnect the USB keyboard rather often. After this 
disconnect/connect I still happen to experience times when the USB stack 
can't synchronize again, leaving me without access to the computer 
(kernel 2.6.12-9). I since I've mentioned this already several years ago 
I though this might be solved but it seems Linux isn't able to build a 
state-of-the-art USB stack which is able to synchronize in _each_ case.
Is there anything I can do to help find out why the USB doesn't work? Is 
there a log anywhere on they system?
