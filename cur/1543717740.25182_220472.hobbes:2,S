In kernel/sysctl.c, you can define a ctl_table entry that has a
proc_handler of proc_dointvec and also define your own strategy
routine.  It turns out that the strategy routine is not called, despite
the comments saying it should be.  echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/foo
invokes sys_write() -> proc_writesys() -> do_rw_proc() ->
proc_dointvec() and completely ignores the strategy field.  The
strategy is only used on the do_sysctl() path, which is deprecated.  Is
this deliberate?
