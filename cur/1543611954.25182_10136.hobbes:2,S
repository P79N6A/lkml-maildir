Don't do it!
A stable kernel should be stable also on the building tools.
When Marcelo will correct some grave potential security problem,
the user will rebuild the kernel and it will found that it must
install some other package (machine with 2.4 are now common,
python2 not yet so common) to secure his kernel, it would be
happy.
This is an example, but for a better maintainability you will
give serious problem to the novice kernel user.

BTW there is alreay a punishment for you:
you will resync the variout ARCH, speak with various
subsystem maintainer, ... before to sent path to Marcelo.
