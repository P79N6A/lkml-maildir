I think your RFC patch is the right solution here. As I see it, there is
no race with your RFC patch.
As long as you call a dummy smp_call_function on all CPUs, we should be
OK. We can get rid of cpu_idle_state
and the current wait forever logic altogether with dummy
smp_call_function. And so there wont be any wait forever scenario.
The whole point of cpu_idle_wait() is to make all CPUs come out of idle
loop atleast once.
The caller will use cpu_idle_wait something like this.
// Want to change idle handler
- Switch global idle handler to always present default_idle
- call cpu_idle_wait so that all cpus come out of idle for an instant
and stop using old idle pointer and start using default idle
- Change the idle handler to a new handler
- optional cpu_idle_wait if you want all cpus to start using the new
handler immediately.
May be the below 1s patch is safe bet for .24. But for .25, I would say
we just replace all complicated logic by simple dummy smp_call_function
and remove cpu_idle_state altogether.
Thanks,
Venki
