frankly, I haven't checked the licenses on the software. I'd suggest going 
to www.tivo.com/linux and download all the source for all the different 
versions there.
by the way, it looks like there is one wireless driver that they ship in 
some releases but don't provide the source for. but if you plan on going 
after them for that you better go after everyone who ships binary kernel 
modules.
