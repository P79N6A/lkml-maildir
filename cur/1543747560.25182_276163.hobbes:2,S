Yes, when potentially hop'ing between CPUs, definitely.

Hrm... on "pure" x86, I would expect so at the HW level, not sure about
x86_64... but there would be definitely an issue on ppc with your
scheme. You need at least a full barrier before you trigger the
workqueue. That may not be the problem you are facing now, but it would
become one.
