Where the hell do you see it above. The only thing I said above is it is
controversial.
The userland tools don't need to know. They just need to not be suid.

Ok, here I say it is ugly (but not that it's crap). And the reason is,
that there is a permission system, with some semantics, and then various
filesystems adapt it in varous ways to fit what they want. So every
filesystem ends up with it's onw little different behaviour.
That being said, fuse does just about the same as NFS, samba and others
and I don't really see the reason why it couldn't be integrated. But
I am not the one to decide.
