You're not.  Complain to nvidia - using both email and snailmail.
If everybody with such problems did that, chances are they see
the light someday. Oh, and complain to the guy handing out
nvidia cards like confetti, state your preference for some other
card.  Perhaps that is easier to achieve.

Whats wrong with tainting?  It is just a message, telling you that
the kernel is unsupported.  In this case because you're running a
closed-source module.  The tainting message itself does not do
anything bad.  There is a way - which is to write an open nvidia
driver.  To do that, you'll need to get the specs out of nvidia or
figure it out by reverse-engineering some other nvidia driver. Either
approach is hard, so people generally find it cheaper to just buy
a supported card.
