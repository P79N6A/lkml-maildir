I have no grudge against this BUG_ON().
But BUG_ON() is more prominent than WARN_ON().
Because I often could not realized whether WARN_ON() happned or not.
Should we make warn_counter which will be increment when WARN_ON()
happens, and export it as /proc/warn-counter? (also export die_counter
as /proc/die-counter) Then I'll make pretty gnome applet.
Or put the shell script which just do "dmesg | grep $warn_on_pattern".
