The documentation is wrong... To my defence, I belived that was the result
when I wrote it because I assumed a slightly different behaviour, which
you can only obtain on UP.
Anyways, I think we found that the general bound is
 2^{depth} ms
(I have to find the old mails to check it though...)
It does require many threads though. But N=10 for d=3 giving 8 ms of
maximum latency should be enough. Notice, that the worst case should be
hit very rarely.
