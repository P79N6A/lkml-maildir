 From my understanding of iptables/ebtables, identical functionality  
is already avaialble within that framework; and as such this patch is  
just removing broken experimental and redundant code.  The IPTables  
code also properly handles IPv6 and all the other old warts of the  
frame diverter as well.  I agree that this should go.
