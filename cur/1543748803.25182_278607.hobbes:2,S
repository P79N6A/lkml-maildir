Posted -11 for -mm and -BK as well. Changes:
- Preemption fairness fixes
- Enable preemption
For 2.6.10-rc3-mm1:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.6/2.6.10-rc3-mm1/cfq-time-slices-11-2.6.10-rc3-mm1.gz
For 2.6-BK:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.6/2.6.10-rc3/cfq-time-slices-11.gz
Note that the syscall numbers are different yet again, I will
consolidate these on next release. For now, find your sys_ioprio_set/get
numbers from include/asm-<your arch/unistd.h and change ionice for your
arch appropriately (if in doubt, just mail me).
