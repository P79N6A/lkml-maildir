I can't tell you how that happened.  I'm certainly not explicitly
setting it anywhere.  Apart from PG_reserved (now gone, as seen above),
I don't touch any page flags.

This is more or less what we're doing now.  Except we're not doing a
get_page after dma_alloc_coherent, and vmops->nopage is doing a
get_page.  Reading between the lines, I guess the driver should be doing
a get_page right after the allocation, and a put_page before it does the
free?  This matches my mental model at least, but it seems that my model
is a bit mental.

OK, we don't have any cases like this.

And we don't have any cases like this either.  All of these mappings are
per-process, not to be shared across fork or clone.
