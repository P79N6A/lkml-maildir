I'm afraid that this a more complicated question than it should be.
I treat the standalone PCMCIA package as my main development vehicle,
because this is what almost everyone uses, and that's what I get bug
reports, patches, etc for.  So fixes go into the standalone package
first.  I've also been sending updates to Linus for the 2.3 tree,
though not for every minor PCMCIA release.  The 2.3 tree still has
only a subset of the client drivers in the full PCMCIA distribution;
I've been working on that off and on, but it has not been my top
priority.
The complication is that Linus has now initiated a rewrite of some
parts of the 2.3 PCMCIA tree on his own, so the code base has been
forked.
