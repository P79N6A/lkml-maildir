I looked for iomem with a kernel-2.4.2:
/proc/iomem reports
00000000-0009fbff : System RAM
0009fc00-0009ffff : reserved
000a0000-000bffff : Video RAM area
000c0000-000c7fff : Video ROM
000f0000-000fffff : System ROM
00100000-1fffbfff : System RAM
Nothing in the region 000d0000-000d0006 (used by my driver),
so why is it BUSY?
I have not tried yet to use it anyway.
Thanks
