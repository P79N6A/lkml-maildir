Subject: [PATCH 004 of 5] md: Allow reshape_position for md arrays to be set via sysfs.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/8/7

"reshape_position" records how much progress has been made on a
"reshape" (adding drives, changing layout or chunksize).
When it is set, the number of drives, layout and chunksize can have
two possible values, an old an a new.
So allow these different values to be visible, and allow both old and
new to be set:  Set the old ones first, then the reshape_position,
then the new values.
