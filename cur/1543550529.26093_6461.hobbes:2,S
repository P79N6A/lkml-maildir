Hi Alan,
2.2.18pre14 compiles and runs on Alpha with the
following patch. It only replaces loops_per_sec with
loops_per_jiffy*HZ. It works for me, although I'm not
totally sure this is quite correct.
BTW, I had to remove nvram and drm to compile. Will
see later why (unknown references to LOCK_PREFIX and
CHECK_DRIVER_INIT).
The loops_per_jiffy patch is attached.
Willy.
