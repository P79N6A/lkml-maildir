To some extent.  To some extent before people started ``correcting''
the situation the masculine pronoun was on it's way to becoming
gender neutral in English. 
In a similar case sir has become vendor neutral in some contexts.
I need to review what has actually happened in the armed services
to see if a vendor neutral usage has caught on at large.  But it is
encouraging to see that things like this can happen.

It lowers my opinion of someone when they do not want to perpetuate
stereo types and yet cannot rephrase a sentence in a gender neutral
way, in English.

So brining this back on topic.   Given that plurals are gender neutral,
and that there are gender neutral words like person and people.  When doing
kernel documentation please do it in a gender neutral way.
