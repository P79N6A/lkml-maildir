It's actually a fair bit worse for us.  We have paths where a false
optimization like this would hyperspace the machine.  In fact, this
frightens me so much I've just gone off to investigate whether gcc has
gone and done this to any of our code.
Clearly the right solution is to introduce threads and write protected
memory into gcc so that the developers are either motivated to ensure
they work or self-destruct.
