Hi,
this goes back to a discussion in August last year:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0408.1/0623.html
The following patchset addresses three issues of the security.h stub
collection:
* All the functions are implemented twice, once for
  CONFIG_SECURITY enabled and once for disabled.
  Makes it harder than necessary to keep in sync
  and the file much longer than needed. 
* We do lots of indirect (and thus non-inlined) calls to
  mostly noop functions, which has a performance impact.
  By using a branch (as suggested by David Mosberger and
  implemented by Brian Baker) we can save a number of cycles.
  Especially visible on IA64, where we can get > 3% improvement
  on netperf -t TCP_RR
* The default of dummy if CONFIG_SECURITY is enabled is not
  desirable as it does differ from the CONFIG_SECURITY disabled
  default. Thus make capabilities the default.
Patches are against 2.6.11-rc4 and follow in subsequent mails.
