Subject: [patch 0/6] New Generic HW RNG

This patch series replaces the old non-generic Hardware Random Number Generator support by a fully generic RNG API.
This makes it possible to register additional RNGs from modules. With this patch series applied, Laptops with
a bcm43xx chip (PowerBook) have a HW RNG available now.
Additionally two new RNG drivers are added for the "ixp4xx" and "omap" devices. (Written by Deepak Saxena).
This patch series includes the old patches by Deepak Saxena.
The x86-rng driver is the old RNG driver ported to the new API (and cleaned up a bit).
Please apply to -mm for testing.
