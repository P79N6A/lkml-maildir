Why would staying in polled mode for 2 jiffies be too long in the 10G 
case? I don't see why 10G makes any difference. Your poll() would be 
called as fast as your CPU allows during those 2 jiffies (it would 
actually be between 1 and 2 jiffies in practice). It is therefore 
critical that the driver's poll() implementation is as efficient as 
possible for the "no work" case to minimize the overhead of the extra 
poll() calls. Your poll might be called thousands of times in 1-2 
jiffies with nothing to do...

My scheme doesn't use timers to do netif_rx_schedule() because the 
device stays in polled mode for 1-2 jiffies _after_ it detects it has no 
more work. So the device remains scheduled, processing packets as usual. 
The device deschedules itself and re-enables its interrupts only when it 
has a period of 1-2 jiffies of doing no work.
BTW, I chose 2 jiffies in the example patch just to keep the patch 
simple. It might be more for systems with large HZ or those that want to 
be even more aggressive at staying in polled mode. I envisage it being 
another parameter that can be tweaked using ethtool if people see a 
benefit of this scheme.
