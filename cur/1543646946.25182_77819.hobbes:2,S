It seems at least one file is missing, the following compile error occurs
when trying to compile 2.5.41-ac1 with both CONFIG_VOYAGER and CONFIG_SMP
enabled:
<--  snip  -->
...
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `arch/i386/mach-voyager/trampoline.o',
needed by `arch/i386/mach-voyager/built-in.o'.  Stop.
make: *** [arch/i386/mach-voyager] Error 2
<--  snip  -->
