Because it is very difficult to determine when a user goes into a
directory because we are using the ramfs/libfs code.  It also does not
cause any errors if the kobject is removed, as the vfs cleans up
properly.
Only when a file is opened does a kobject need to be pinned, due to
possible errors that could happen.
