The ide and /dev/random related latencies are indeed gone.  Here is an
ugly one that I got:
preemption latency trace v1.0
-----------------------------
 latency: 142 us, entries: 4 (4)
 process: ksoftirqd/0/2, uid: 0
 nice: -10, policy: 0, rt_priority: 0
=======>
 0.000ms (+0.000ms): rhine_check_duplex (rhine_timer)
 0.000ms (+0.000ms): mdio_read (rhine_check_duplex)
 0.067ms (+0.067ms): mdio_read (rhine_timer)
 0.139ms (+0.071ms): check_preempt_timing (sub_preempt_count)
This looks like the exact same problem Florian had, in his case it was 
the sis900 driver.  Your recommendation was:
        #define mdio_delay() do { } while (0)
Should I try this?
Also, isn't there a better solution than for network drivers to actively 
poll for changes in link status?  Can't they just register a callback that 
will get run on a link state change event?
