Sigh.  No.  The comment header says it all:
	/**
	 * roundup_pow_of_two - round the given value up to nearest power of two
	 * @n - parameter
	 *
	 * round the given value up to the nearest power of two
	 * - the result is undefined when n == 0
	 * - this can be used to initialise global variables from constant data
	 */
Ie: round, say, 30 up to 32, not 5.
