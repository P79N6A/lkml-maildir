It isn't that hard to build a cross compiler straight from the 3.x
sources; just takes an extra pass.  I've had pretty good luck building
m68k-linux and ppc-linux cross C/C++ compilers from the sources, all I
needed to do was to build a boostrap C compiler that is used to build
glibc, and then come back and build a full up C/C++ compiler.  Check
out the build script from Bill Gatliff's site:
