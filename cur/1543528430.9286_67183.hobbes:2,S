This reminds of reading about booting Linux out of VM's on an S/390. Since IBM
is working to improve the Linux support there, that could be the best form of
high availability for linux, until someone comes up with one of these 32-cpu
machines that *isn't* built around some sort of DataCenter Win2k setup. Of
course, you'd have to be doing some serious work to drop 7 figures for a
machine, but wouldn't that be sweet?
