It's better to do an include here. Duplicating prototypes in .c files
is frowned upon (despite the fact that it's already done here).

We've been steadily moving towards grouping EXPORTs with function
definitions. Do *_ksyms.c exist solely to provide exports for
functions defined in assembly at this point? If so, perhaps we ought
to come up with a suitable export macro for asm files.

Any reason this needs its own .S file? One wonders if the
        .p2align 4
in memcpy.S is appropriate here too. Splitting rep movsq across two
lines is a little weird to me too, but I see Andi did it too.
