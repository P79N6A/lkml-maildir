> Am I missing something or the patch is really broken?
I don't think it is broken, there are many people who did succeed in building 
without reporting broken patches. I use "patch" version 2.5.4, Rik's 
bitkeeper diff's did always work for me. Maybe you should upgrade to a newer 
version of patch.
Thank you and good luck
Jörg
