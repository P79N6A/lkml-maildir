Subject: Sharing modules between different kernels of same version.

I'm wondering if it's possible to compile two different kernels, with
varying drivers and architecture, but share a single set of compiled modules
between them?
Is this possible or is some information stored somehere (in kernel or
module) that would prevent me from doing so.  Such as address/offsets or
similar. I'm sorry I don't know much about how the module support is
designed, so I ask here.
The architectures are x86, a Pentium II and a 486.  I would probably
want the modules compiled for use on the 486 and wonder if that would
prevent proper operation if used by the kernel built for an i686?
