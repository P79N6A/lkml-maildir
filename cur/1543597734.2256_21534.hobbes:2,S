I've had the same problem, with my intel etherExpres Pro/100
But I've solve it, by using the e100 driver provide by intel in replacement of 
the eepro100 driver provide by kernel.
You can find source of e100 at this URL : 
http://appsr.intel.com/scripts-
df/File_Filter.asp?FileName=e100  I 've used the file e100-1.6.13.tar.gz.
Compile and Install without any problem, and now, the card work perfectly.
