i'm compiling 2.6.13-rc6-mm2 atm and noticed that xfs is having lots of 
warnings while compiling. recently i switched to gcc 4.0.1 - maybe it's 
because of this.
details:
fs/xfs/xfs_acl.c: In function 'xfs_acl_access':
fs/xfs/xfs_acl.c:445: warning: 'matched.ae_perm' may be used uninitialized 
in this function
fs/xfs/xfs_alloc_btree.c: In function 'xfs_alloc_insrec':
fs/xfs/xfs_alloc_btree.c:622: warning: 'nrec.ar_startblock' may be used 
uninitialized in this function
fs/xfs/xfs_alloc_btree.c:622: warning: 'nrec.ar_blockcount' may be used 
uninitialized in this function
fs/xfs/xfs_bmap.c: In function 'xfs_bmap_alloc':
fs/xfs/xfs_bmap.c:2335: warning: 'rtx' is used uninitialized in this 
function
fs/xfs/xfs_dir2_sf.c: In function 'xfs_dir2_block_sfsize':
fs/xfs/xfs_dir2_sf.c:110: warning: 'parent' may be used uninitialized in 
this function
fs/xfs/xfs_dir_leaf.c: In function 'xfs_dir_leaf_to_shortform':
fs/xfs/xfs_dir_leaf.c:653: warning: 'parent' may be used uninitialized in 
this function
fs/xfs/xfs_ialloc_btree.c: In function 'xfs_inobt_insrec':
fs/xfs/xfs_ialloc_btree.c:750: warning: 'nrec.ir_free' is used 
uninitialized in this function
fs/xfs/xfs_ialloc_btree.c:750: warning: 'nrec.ir_freecount' is used 
uninitialized in this function
fs/xfs/xfs_ialloc_btree.c:567: warning: 'nrec.ir_startino' may be used 
uninitialized in this function
and the following warning appears a lot of times:
fs/xfs/xfs_bmap_btree.h:508:21: warning: "__BIG_ENDIAN" is not defined
fs/xfs/xfs_bmap_btree.h:626:21: warning: "__BIG_ENDIAN" is not defined
just giving a heads-up if somebody wants to clean this code. 
thanx + greetings,
Damir
