Sorry you're getting involved in this. It all centres around me merging a few of
the more popular performance patches [O(1),preempt,low latency,rmap]. 
The preempt count in the log they're referring to only occurs frequently with my
patches so it's not due to your code; it happens with every single process using
my butchered patch. I based the merging on your latest patch for 2.4.19 and a
previous patch you had created for preempt on O(1) for 2.4.18

I don't expect you to debug this, and I expect it's a fault in my version of
sched.c (most obvious choice).
Cheers,
Con Kolivas
