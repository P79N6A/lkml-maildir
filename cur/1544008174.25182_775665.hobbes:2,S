You're in luck. I still had /proc/io* contents from .28-rc3 lying around 
from working on some other issue.
Here's the relevant diff for iomem; there's no diff for ioports.

I've tried a few quick suspend/resume cycles and no failures so far, but 
that's not really conclusive yet.
Besides snd_hda_intel I've also been unloading e1000e before suspend 
because I thought it contributed to resume failures. I'm now keeping that 
loaded as well. Will report results.
Cheers,
