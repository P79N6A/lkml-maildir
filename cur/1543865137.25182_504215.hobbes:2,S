We violently agree on this :).

I might quibble with some of the details, but I understand your  
fundamental concern.  I do.  I don't get up each morning *thrilled*  
by the idea of having to update lockdep, sysrq-t, etc, to understand  
these fibril things :).  The current fibril switch isn't nearly as  
clever as the lock-free task scheduling switch.  It'd be nice if we  
didn't have to do that work to optimize the hell out of it, sure.

It'd certainly be doable to throw together a credible attempt to  
service "asys" system call submission with full-on kernel threads.   
That seems like reasonable due diligence to me.  If full-on threads  
are almost as cheap, great.  If fibrils are so much cheaper that they  
seem to warrant investing in, great.
I am concerned about the change in behaviour if we fall back to full  
kernel threads, though.  I really, really, want aio syscalls to  
behave just like sync ones.
Would your strategy be to update the syscall implementations to share  
data in task_struct so that there isn't as significant a change in  
behaviour?  (sharing current->ioprio, instead if just inheriting it,  
for example.).  We'd be betting that there would be few of these and  
that they'd be pretty reasonable to share?
