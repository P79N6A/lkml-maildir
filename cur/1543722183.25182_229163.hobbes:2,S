It does need some architecture-specific support for getting the caching
behaviour right, but I do believe that as long as there is some "struct
page" that can be returned, together with a way of setting the
vm_page_prot bits right, it should be ok.
The argument at some point was that some architectures may not even _have_
a "struct page" for DMA memory, since it's not "normal" memory (ie "slow
memory" on m68k). However, I thought we all agreed that such a "struct
page" could be furnished if that architecture wants so support mmap'ing.
