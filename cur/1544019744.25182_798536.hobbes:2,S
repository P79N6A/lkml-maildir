I think very few architectures actually need the unsigned long.
For 2.4 I had a hack (when it did still matter for struct page)
to define a new type for this that denoted the minimal type size
needed here.
That could be reintroduced. Then only the few archs which really
require unsigned long here would pay the overhead.
