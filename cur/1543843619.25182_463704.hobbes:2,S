Disagree.  I was describing a means by which a set of systemtap trace
points could be described.  A means which would allow those tracepoints to
be maintained without human intervention as the kernel source changes. 
(ie: use a similar algorithm and representation as patch(1)).
Presumably those tracepoints would have been provided by a kernel developer
and delivered to non-developers, just like static tracepoints.

People have been speeding up kprobes in recent kernels, to avoid the int3
overhead.  I don't recall seeing how effective that has been.
