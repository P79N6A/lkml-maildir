It happened somewhere after 2.1.74. I've already corrected it for the
NFS write-gathering code and smbfs in the 'ac' series since it gives a
downright bug in the NFS code (you copy onto a page before checking
whether it is being flushed or not). 'generic_file_write' should not
do anything other than the minimum required to call the lower level
routines.
NB: It should NOT set PG_lock, or PG_uptodate. Nor should it copy the
data. All these things should be done by the lower level.
 The reason I haven't propagated my change to Linus' tree is 'cos I'm
loth to break anything else that uses generic_file_write: we are after
all in a stable release, so these interfaces are not supposed to
change.
Cheers,
