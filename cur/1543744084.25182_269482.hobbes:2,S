Hmn, this bug has been present since the beginning of 2.6, probably even
2.5, hidden, but got exposed during the cursor cleanup.  The main problem is
that fbcon is not checking if the vt is using its own softcursor, and this
has been the case since the fb architecture was rewritten. 
We fix this by checking if vt.c is using its softcursor
(vc->vc_cursor_type & 0x10), and if true, disable fbcon cursor.
I'll submit a patch to Andrew.
