 Hi,
 I have seen many patch baches in LKML that look like arranged by some
 kind of script.
 Are there any public scripts to do the job?
 Could some kind soul send me his "patch sending" script?
 I'll put them all together in some kind of web page for everyone to use
 and try to make a "one size fits all" tool based on them.
 There also seams to be some arrangement rules, which are not always the
 same.
 Is there any preference or documentation on the different arrangements?
 I could also gather information here and document it for those to come.
 Have a nice day
 	Manuel
