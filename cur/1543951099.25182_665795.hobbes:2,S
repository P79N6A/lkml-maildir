That sounds more like a Xen bug. Why should it validate anything except
the first four entries which are used by the hardware? 
I can imagine that false sharing would be slow because you would
have unnecessary traps, but it shouldn't be a correctness issue.

x86-64 used to do that, but it turned out this breaks some shared cache 
optimizations on the P4 between SMT threads. So you might actually see 
user space performance regressions from it.
