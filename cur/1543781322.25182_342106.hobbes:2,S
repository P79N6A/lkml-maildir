That needs to be cleaned up before merge. This code is already ugly and I don't
want the cruft accumulating here.

I was thinking of IO-APIC hotplug here. IIRC the ia64 folks
have it already and I'm sure someone will turn up with a patch
for i386/x86-64 soon. For devices it should be ok, you're right.
Ok I guess they can change it in that patch then. Perhaps
just add a comment.

Can you drop into the sharing path unconditionally?
