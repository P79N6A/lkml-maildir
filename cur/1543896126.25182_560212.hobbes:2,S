Not in this case. If an attacker can CHANGE THE BINARY then
it's already game over.
Putting this into the security policy was an error born of
lazyness to begin with. Abuse of the security mechanism
was easier than hacking the toolchain, ELF loader, etc.
Either a binary needs self-modification, or it doesn't. This is
determined by the author of the code. If you don't trust an
executable that needs this ability, then you simply can not
run it in a useful way.
