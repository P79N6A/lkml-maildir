Strongly agreed.  I stress this, in Linux driver writing talks and 
rants, to whomever will listen as "the proper way to do things in Linux".
Presuming things about a device's state upon entry to the driver has led 
to bugs in the past.  Popular bugs include assuming (a) MAC address 
registers hold a valid/useful value or (b) ethernet NIC's DMA engine is 
not active.  Both of these are quite often not true when you take into 
account driver re-loads, warm reboots, and firmware features such as USB 
kbd/mouse/storage or PXE booting from a network.
A good driver unconditionally makes sure the device is inactive in its 
probe function (struct pci_driver::probe), before registering itself 
with any kernel subsystems.  This must also be done before request_irq 
and before enabling the bus-mastering bit in PCI_COMMAND register.
