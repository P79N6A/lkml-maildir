Megaraid still needs fixing. I sent you the patch twice, so have
other people, but it still isn't fixed. The
megaBase &= PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK;
...
megaBase &= PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_IO_MASK;
is removed by the 2.2.18 version (read the patch) and that breaks
older megaraid cards.
Existing megaraid system with 2.2.x kernels WILL break with 2.2.18
