That is too often not the case.
I can get the desktop machine working about as comfortably
as 2.4.19 with:
# echo 10 > max_timeslice 
# echo 0 > prio_bonus_ratio 
ie: disabling all the fancy new scheduler features :(
Dropping max_timeslice fixes the enormous stalls which happen
when an interactive process gets incorrectly identified as a
cpu hog.  (OK, that's expected)
But when switching virtual desktops some windows still take a
large fraction of a second to redraw themselves.  Disabling the
interactivity estimator fixes that up too.  (Not OK.  That's bad)
hm.  It's actually quite nice.  I'd be prepared to throw away
a few cycles for this.
I don't expect the interactivity/cpuhog estimator will ever work
properly on the desktop, frankly.  There will always be failure
cases when a sudden swing in load causes it to make the wrong
decision.
So it appears that to stem my stream of complaints we need to
merge scheduler_tunables.patch and edit my /etc/rc.local.
