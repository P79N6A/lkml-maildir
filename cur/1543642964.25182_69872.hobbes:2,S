It would seem that in 2.5.34 gendisk->part[0] no longer refers to the
whole disk, but instead refers to the first partition.  Is this
correct? There isn't a struct hd_struct that refers to the whole disk
anymore?
I'm working on porting forward the sard patch for disk statistics, so I
want to make sure this is the intent and not an off-by-one bug. Other
code, though, suggests it's intentional.
