Ben,
Any updates on when we can see some more "core" aio code for 2.5 ?
Is the code you've been developing substantially the same as in 2.4 ?
 From a brief examination of the 2.4 aio code for raw I/O, it doesn't 
look like it'll need a whole lot of changes except to use bio's. Or do 
you have a different design in place now ?
Any comments/dates will be much appreciated....
