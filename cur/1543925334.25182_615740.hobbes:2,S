Actually, it is rather mmap() needs to be fixed. It is cold calling the
filesystem while holding all sorts of nasty locks. It needs to be
migrated to the same sort of syscall layout as read() and write().
You _first_ call the filesystem so that it can make whatever
preparations it needs outside the lock. The filesystem then calls the
VM, which can then call the filesystem back if needed.
