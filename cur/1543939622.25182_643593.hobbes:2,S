Hi,
I have been working on a watchdog timer using the mfgpt on AMD Geode
CS5536. I initialize the setup register MFGPT0_SETUP (0x6206) with hex
value 0x306 (1100000110b). However, after this first initialization if I
ever read/write to the register it hangs the system.
I have been through all the documentation, tried several different methods
but all the efforts, frustratingly, to no avail.
Does anyone have any idea as to why would this be? TIA!
