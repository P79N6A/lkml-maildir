Just as a curiosity, why not do this in userspace ?
You'll notice that /bin/mount already is a suid application,
so you could just add your functionality there, or write your
own suid mount application.
As an added bonus, you'd be able to have a more flexible
configuration framework then what would ever be accepted
into the kernel, without needing to go through the effort
of getting anything merged into the kernel.
