No. This is forbidden by the intel documentation. First off, the
documentation clearly states that it's a locked r-m-w cycle.
Secondly, the documentation also makes it clear that the CPU page table
accesses work correctly in SMP environments, which the above simply would
not do. It doesn't allow for people marking the entry invalid, which is
documented to work (see the very part I quoted).
So while the above could be a valid TLB writeback strategy in general for
some hypothetical architecture, it would _not_ be an x86 CPU any more if
it acted that way. 
So a plain "just write out our cached value" is definitely not legal.

True. I'd still consider it unlikely for the other reasons (ie this is not
a timing-critical part of the normal CPU behaviour), but you're right - it
could be done without making the actual TLB any bigger or different, by
just having the TLB fill routine having a separate "source cache" that the
dirty-marking can use.
