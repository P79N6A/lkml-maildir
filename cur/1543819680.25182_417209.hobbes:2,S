I guess this would require per-vfsmount flags (i.e. mount --bind -o ro)
to be implemented, but IIUC the suggestion is
given a policy
/bin/stty {
	/bin/stty r
}
during execve AA would unshare(CLONE_NEWNS), remount / readonly and
noexec,  and mount /bin/stty into place with exec privs.  I guess
getting /bin/stty into place shouldn't be much of a challenge (i.e.
just do the operations in the order
	mkdir /.tmp123
	mount --bind -o ro,noexec / /.tmp123
	mount --bind /bin/stty /.tmp123/bin/stty
	mount --bind /.tmp123 /
)
but implementing the 'ux' exec permission which apparmor currently has
(i.e. giving the ability for stty to then execute /bin/login without
restrictions) could be more challenging.
This also might beg for sys_unshare() (and corresponding code in clone)
to have it's own security_vfs_unshare() hook, rather than being globbed
in with CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
