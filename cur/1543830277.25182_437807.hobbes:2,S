I don't need to do anything special.  They are just IP packets.
If packets are local in the current net namespace, they are delivered to
socket or handled by icmp_rcv.
Certainly, packet/raw sockets shouldn't see packets they aren't supposed to
see.  For raw sockets, it implies making socket lookup aware of namespaces,
exactly like for TCP or UDP.
