Exactly, and given that this is a fairly easy thing to do, and that
occasionally we see systems where this happens (even if their BIOS is
later fixed).  It is likely worth it for someone to write up the patch
and that compare MTRRs with available memory, and to complain and
reserve all memory that MTRRs claim is not write-back.
