Insufficient data to draw anti-local-APIC conclusions.
- ensure you have the latest BIOS
- if you're using APM, ensure that CPU_IDLE and DISPLAY_BLANK are
  disabled, and that APM isn't built as a module
  (these things are known to cause APM hangs in UP APIC systems)
- if you're using ACPI, try without ACPI, or at least with ACPI not
  doing any power management
A very general "may break some BIOSen" warning could be in order.
