Hey Larry,
You might check out the asterisk project, 
http://www.asteriskpbx.org
Its a fully open source pc based PBX system that supports a wide variety
of PSTN options as well as a open source voip protocol called IAX, as
well as H.323 and SIP support is supposed to be coming (as soon as a
group or a person wants to donate some cash to its implementation).  So
far I have been very impressed with their progress.
