I suspect it would disturb timing so badly that it might hide the original
problem. If that is true then adding udelays might hide it too. 
Ok i guess you could test with a UP kernel. There change_page_attr
should be much cheaper because it doesn't need to IPI to other CPUs. Also use 
a .2.6.20-rc* kernel that uses CLFLUSH in there, not WBINVD which is also
very costly.
Anyways I guess we can just wait what the hardware people figure out.
