Well, the ideas are somewhat similar, but I'm viewing it more from a
module perspective that lets any module author implement something, so
it's not specialized, and hopefully has a better chance of getting in
the kernel (i.e. I think your system could work for this as well).
basically what I envision is something simple, in process creation and
deletion we do something like
item = some list_head;
while (item)
{
	item->function(task_struct);
	item = item->next;
}
so it has very little overhead into the actual kernel if it's not being
used (1 memory load and 1 compare/branch).
the way pagg would work (I think, just did a cursory reading) is that
instead of storing the data in the task_struct, you'd have a seperate
struct that deal with it.  Not as pretty in that regards, but also the
standard way modules that want to extend the linux kernel have to work,
and therefore hopefully linus would be willing to include it in his
kernel.
