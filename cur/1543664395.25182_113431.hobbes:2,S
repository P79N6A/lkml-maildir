Agreed, a benchmark suite gives a better view of overall performance.
When ext3 came out I benchmarked it running a usenet news server. I
configured it for one file per article and fed in about 100k articles with
each one being offered multiple times to generate both rejects and
accepts. I suppose I should do that again, it would give some insight into
performance creating *lots* of files, many in the same directory.
Needless to say for production use I configure a news server for least
resources and the filesystem plays little part in the performance.
