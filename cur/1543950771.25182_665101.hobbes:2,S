Ah. :-)  So is there no way to add mount options, or is there a 
different mechanism today?

I mount multiple remote file systems.  Only one of them I own, so I'm 
willing to potentially hammer it with huge READDIRPLUS requests, while 
the others probably deserve more benign behavior. ;-)
In general, I think having system-wide defaults somewhere in proc is 
helpful---and certainly superior to a constant in the source---but there 
should really be mount-specific overrides wherever the system-wide 
default might not be globally appropriate.
