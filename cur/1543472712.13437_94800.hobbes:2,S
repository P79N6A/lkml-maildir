Hey guy can You imagin the following situation:
I don't care whatever linux is free or not or whatever, as long, as long 
it is reasonable affordable for me. In fact about $50 for a desktop os
seems OK to me. I'm using Linux for technical and not political reasons.
And I don't care about you needing to get some ego points by renaming it 
to GNU/Linux. The GNU project has started with the intent to provide
it's
own kernel compleatly independant from the FSF. In fact at the beginning
the Copyright text wasn't even the same...
So the situation is the following:
1. X11 doesn't came out of the FSF.
2. TeX doesn't came out of the FSF.
3. Linux-kernel doesn't came out of the FSF.
4. Lots of utility programms only got assimilated by the FSF and not 
written by them or in esp. You.
5. KDE/Qt doesn't came out of the FSF.
6. Netscape doesn't came out of the FSF.
and many many others, which shurely account for most of the code beeing
run
on my system. Therefore calling it GNU/Linux in esp. that order is just
a lie.

PS. BTW. Still the question remains: Whot does this have to do with the
linux kernel's developement?
