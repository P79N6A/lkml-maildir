Compiled 2.3.99-pre3-7 with PCMCIA builtin, including cardbus support.
Using cardmgr from David Hind's PCMCIA beta, dated March 20.  It
recognises a 16 bit AHA152x card but it does not recognise a cardbus
Xircom RBEM56G 10/100 + modem.  The problem appears to be this bit of
code in drivers/pcmcia/cistpl.c, pcmcia_get_first_tuple.
        pcibios_read_config_dword(s->cap.cb_dev->subordinate->number, 0, 0x28, &ptr);
        tuple->CISOffset = ptr & ~7;
        SPACE(tuple->Flags) = (ptr & 7);
tuple->CISOffset is coming back as 0x100 which is probably too high.
When pcmcia_get_next_tuple is called it immediately returns
CS_NO_MORE_ITEMS.  After that nothing works.  I have lspci output if
anybody wants it, or any other debugging data for that matter.  Does
the fact that this is a multifunction card have any bearing on the
problem?
