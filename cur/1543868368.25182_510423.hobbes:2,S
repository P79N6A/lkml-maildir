Oops. it should return 1 on success.

It's a BUG, I'll fix it.

ok.. I'll convert the functions to be consistent with the
"return 0 on success" philosophy.

The container field of the mm_struct is protected by a read write spin lock.

We took a consistent snapshot of cont. It cannot change outside the lock,
we check the value outside. I am sure I missed something.

Yes, will do.

Yes, because we are adding a -1, reducing the rss on failure.
> Why does MEMCTLR_DONT_CHECK_LIMIT exist?
> 
MEMCTLR_DONT_CHECK_LIMIT exists for the following reasons
1. Pages are shared during fork, fork() is not failed at that point
    since the pages are shared anyway, we allow the RSS limit to be
    exceeded.
2. When ZERO_PAGE is added, we don't check for limits (zeromap_pte_range).
3. On reducing RSS (passing -1 as the value)
