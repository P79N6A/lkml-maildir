Hi Manik
and sorry that I read only half of your initial post.
I had a quick look at fs/read_write.c.
I don't see any hook in the functions here, to perform such a task. And
here this should belong to -- shouldn't it?
the functions could add ``count'' to the procfs entry of ``current''.
(just a thought) This info could be valuable - I think - if it wouldn't
make a large performance issue.
Regards
Frank
