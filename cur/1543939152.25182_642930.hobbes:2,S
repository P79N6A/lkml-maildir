no, that build error was in patch #2, and your later patch made it 
possible for me to bisect down to that point. #1 failed differently. 
(and not in module.c - dont remember the details - let me know if you 
cannot reproduce - the hang in #2 was the more significant bug.) The 
hang gave no messages on the earlyprintk serial console.
