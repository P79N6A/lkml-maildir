Stop making stupid statements like this, please, and comparing well-defined
RFC standards with proprietary formats. 
MIME is a way for people that happen to use non 7bit characters to be able
to print their name correctly, even in presence of MTAs somewhere in between
that don't handle 8bit. Or with PGP, which also prefers 7bit ...
You'll probably complain about me using a GnuPG signature as well.
