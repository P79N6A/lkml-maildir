No, imagine /dev/hda3 being set as swap in /etc/fstab, but user doing
swapoff /dev/hda3, swapon /dev/usb_zip_drive, then suspend.
/etc/mtab would be better choice, but swap does not appear there.

Well, I'd hate to write docs for that system call.
"It is exit and resume from specified swap, you must not write any
disk before you call it, must not access (list) devices, must not
access any network."

Well, just compile all the drivers you need in, and it just
works.... I'm using both cardbus and usb and no, I'm not using
modules.
