to further expand on the above question it isn't really crystal clear
whether this (from the ATI driver) is legal..
(psuedo diff vs the kernel agp drivers)
+#ifdef STANDALONE_AGPGART
 MODULE_AUTHOR("Jeff Hartmann <jhartmann@precisioninsight.com>");
 MODULE_PARM(agp_try_unsupported, "1i");
 #ifdef MODULE_LICENSE
 MODULE_LICENSE("GPL and additional rights");
+#endif
and then linking the result to their binary blob.
I assume ATI's lawyers think its legal, as it's been a year and
a half since I first brought this questionable act to their
attention.
