Subject: [PATCH 01/15] mm: poison struct page for ptlock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/9/423

The split ptlock patch enlarged the default SMP PREEMPT struct page from
32 to 36 bytes on most 32-bit platforms, from 32 to 44 bytes on PA-RISC
7xxx (without PREEMPT).  That was not my intention, and I don't believe
that split ptlock deserves any such slice of the user's memory.
Could we please try this patch, or something like it?  Again to overlay
the spinlock_t from &page->private onwards, with corrected BUILD_BUG_ON
that we don't go too far; with poisoning of the fields overlaid, and
unsplit SMP config verifying that the split config is safe to use them.
The previous attempt at this patch broke ppc64, which uses slab for its
page tables - and slab saves vital info in page->lru: but no config of
spinlock_t needs to overwrite lru on 64-bit anyway; and the only 32-bit
user of slab for page tables is arm26, which is never SMP i.e. all the
problems came from the "safety" checks, not from what's actually needed.
So previous checks refined with #ifdefs, and a BUG_ON(PageSlab) added.
This overlaying is unlikely to be portable forever: but the added checks
should warn developers when it's going to break, long before any users.
