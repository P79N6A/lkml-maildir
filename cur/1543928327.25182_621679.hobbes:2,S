Cool, thanks.

This is true.  There is only one sysctl table, and it's data points
to the location of the desired field in the initial namespace.  So
the trickery finds the same field in the target namespace.
I believe Eric and Pavel are working on a patchset that will make
this trickery unnecessary by having sort of shadow sysctls.
