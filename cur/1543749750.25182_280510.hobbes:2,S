I didn't realize this was ppc64 testing.  What was the exact setup
for the testing?  The patch as posted (and I hope clearly explained)
only turns on the behavior by default when both CONFIG_NUMA and
CONFIG_IA64 were active.  It could be activated on non-IA64 by setting
hashdist=1 on the boot line, or by modifying the patch.
I would hate to find out that the testing didn't actually enable the
new behavior.
Thanks,
Brent
