Subject: 2.4 odd behaviour of ramdisk + cramfs

I am experiencing a problem when I try to run the following script:
#! /bin/sh
cat /flash/modules-2.4.21 > /dev/ram1
mount -t cramfs -o ro /dev/ram1 /lib/modules
Running it once causes the mount to fail with 'cramfs: wrong magic' - 
running it twice will make mount succeed on the second try.
Oddly enough, repeating the 2 lines within the script doesn't work either.
The behaviour has been reproduced by several people with different 2.4 
kernels.
As I need this to go into some boot scripts, I'd like this to work without 
human intervention.
Any suggestions ?

Typical kernel config:
2.4.21 unpatched kernel tree
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE=4096
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
CONFIG_CRAMFS=y
CONFIG_TMPFS=y
CONFIG_RAMFS=y
