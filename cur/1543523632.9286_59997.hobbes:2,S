It's worse than that. The L2 cache-controller 'knows' where a write
occurred. It also 'knows' where a read occurred. It does not 'know'
that a bit is missing in the decode because there are no bits missing
in the L2 cache. It may not even read the aliased location a second
time. It's already in the cache.
The 'slow' address-bit20 enable happens on some machines because it's
handled by the keyboard controller which is a uP that takes time to do
things. If the machine is not broken, all you have to do is wait some
time.
The bus clock is still going to timer-channel zero even though its
interrupts have been turned off. You can spin on the hardware count,
waiting to it to change at least 120 times (don't care about the
actual value). This will guarantee the 1 ms necessary for the
a20 bit to be enabled. Since all IBM/Intel machines have that
timer, it's already enabled, and it all runs off the same clock,
it will work on any machine of any speed. Note that we don't
care if the divisor has been set. The BIOS divisor was 0 (65536)
which would have generated an interrupt at 18.206 times per second.
This same mechanism can be used for small timeouts in kernel
drivers. In other words, we don't really need 'BogoMIPS'. You
can spin on the hardware rather than a register-count.
