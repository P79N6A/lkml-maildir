You may have stuck processes wich doesn't run but count as active for
the load avg count. Almost all processes that get stuck in D state and
can't be killed increases the load avg by one per process stuck.
So look for processes in zombie state or D state. If you can't kill them
perhaps you will need to reboot.
If it increases slowly it could be another thing, but if it increases
suddenly at a fixed time it could be a cron job.
