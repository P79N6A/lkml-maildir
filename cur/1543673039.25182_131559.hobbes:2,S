Well, not exactly the _only_ one. Inferior alternatives include
 - tracking all user memory accesses, and protecting those pages
   against modifications by other processes (but this adds a
   deadlock risk)
 - like above, but copy all such data to/from a user space area
   that is then protected
 - like above, but use kernel space instead, then use
   set_fs(KERNEL_DS)
Which probably just proves that there are always more painful ways
to do things :-)
