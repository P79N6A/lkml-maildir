Hi!
We have a fairly large installation on-campus, and we have some problems
with the current linux-kernel (and older ones) - namely that processes
entering D-state will stay there forever (given that the right event got
them there in the first place).  This right event is killing the 
autofs-daemon.  Doing this will result in heavy load because of lots
of D-state processes, and you can't kill any of the D-state processes.
Why shouldn't one be able to kill processes that has entered D-state?
We have to reboot our servers to get rid of this problem, and it's
rather annoying.
