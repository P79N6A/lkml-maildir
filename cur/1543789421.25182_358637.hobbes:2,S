why you insist on ktimers being 'process timers'? They are totally 
separate entities, not limited to any process notion. One of their first 
practical use happens to be POSIX process timers (both itimers and 
ptimers) via them, but no way are ktimers only 'process timers'. They 
are very generic timers, usable for any kernel purpose.
so to answer your question: it is totally possible for a watchdog 
mechanism to use ktimers. In fact it would be desirable from a 
robustness POV too: e.g. we dont want a watchdog from being 
overload-able via too many timeouts in the timer wheel ...
