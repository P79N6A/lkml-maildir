Subject: PROBLEM: 2.3.99-pre3 missing symbol tcp_v4_send_reset for ipt_REJECT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
 2.3.99-pre3 missing symbol tcp_v4_send_reset for ipt_REJECT
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
 I compiled the iptables and packet filtering support as
modules. Appearently the ipt_REJECT module has an unmet dependence to
tcp_v4_send_reset. AFAIU this symbol is exported by netsyms.c only for
some rare cases (IPv6, http accelleration...), which are not enabled in my
configuration.
[3.] Keywords:
 modules, networking, kernel, 2.3.99-pre3, iptables, tcp_v4_send_reset
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.3.99-pre3 (root@tk147051)
(gcc version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux))
#1 Mon Mar 27 15:18:12 CEST 2000
[5.] Output
/lib/modules/2.3.99-pre3/ipv4/ipt_REJECT.o: unresolved symbol tcp_v4_send_reset
/lib/modules/2.3.99-pre3/ipv4/ipt_REJECT.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.3.99-pre3/ipv4/ipt_REJECT.o failed
/lib/modules/2.3.99-pre3/ipv4/ipt_REJECT.o: insmod ipt_REJECT failed
[7.] Environment
Probably not relevant, if someone can _not_ reproduce this problem, i
am sorry, please tell me, i will provide information about the
environment then.
Maybe all relevant info is:

[7.5.] modutils:
insmod version 2.3.9
depmod version 2.3.9
modprobe version 2.3.9
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
[X.1.] A patch:
 The following patch to linux/net/netsyms.c solves the problem, but
i'm not enough a hacker to know what it does else... sorry.

> #endif
[X.2.] Disclaimer:
 This is my second kernel bug report. I learned a lot about bug report
style since then. If however it is still not satisfying, please tell
me.
 I tried to find out if someone else has already reported this
problem. I am sorry if so. I also did not check unofficial patches.
Thanks
Leonard
