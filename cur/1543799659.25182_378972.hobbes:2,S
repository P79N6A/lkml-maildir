From: Kristian Slavov <kristian.slavov@nomadiclab.com>
I reported a problem and gave hints to the solution, but nobody seemed
to react. So I prepared a patch against 2.6.14.4.
Tested on 2.6.14.4 with "ip monitor addr" and with the program
attached, while adding and removing IPv6 address. Both programs didn't
receive any messages.  Tested 2.6.14.4 + this patch, and both programs
received add and remove messages.
