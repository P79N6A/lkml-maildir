   Please check whether these devices are recognized by the latest
version of lspci. If they aren't, please send me a patch adding their
IDs to the pci.ids file.
   The PCI ID list in 2.2 kernels is not kept uptodate, but the pci.ids
file from which both pciutils and 2.3 kernels take the ID's is.
				Have a nice fortnight
