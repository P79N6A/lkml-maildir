Added, 1 vs 2/3/4 clients isn't very interesting, so to keep it short
here are numbers for 2 clients to /dev/null and localhost.
Sending to /dev/null
ml370:/data # ./splice-bench -n2 -l10 -a -s -z file
Waiting for clients
Client1 (splice): 19030 MiB/sec (10240MiB in 551 msecs)
Client0 (splice): 18961 MiB/sec (10240MiB in 553 msecs)
Client1 (mmap): 158875 MiB/sec (10240MiB in 66 msecs)
Client0 (mmap): 158875 MiB/sec (10240MiB in 66 msecs)
Client1 (rw): 1691 MiB/sec (10240MiB in 6200 msecs)
Client0 (rw): 1690 MiB/sec (10240MiB in 6201 msecs)
Sending/receiving over lo
ml370:/data # ./splice-bench -n2 -l10 -a -s file
