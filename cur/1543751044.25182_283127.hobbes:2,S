Ok, let's start merging this slowly, and in particular, this 1/4 one looks 
pretty much like a cleanup regardless of whatever else happen, so let's 
just do it. However, for it to really be a cleanup, how about making 
_this_ part:

Match the existing previous part:

>  			prep_compound_page(page, order);
and just split it up into a "prep_zero_page(page, order)"? I dislike 
#ifdef's in the middle of deep functions. In the middle of a _trivial_ 
function it's much more palatable.
At that point at least part 1 ends up being a nice clean patch on its own, 
and should even shrink the code-size a bit. IOW, it not only is a cleanup, 
there is even a technical argument for it (even without worrying about the 
next stages).
Hmm?
