2.6.6 still fails, just like the failure reported by the thread independent of 
swappiness: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=107806010900002&r=1&w=2
However; as hinted in the thread turning off premption does seem to fix the 
problem.
When will the CONFIG_PREEMPT work with swsusp again?  (it works with 2.6.2-mm1 
on my system a NEC VERSA E120 Daylite with 512MB ram)  
Also, why does it burp out such a bogus message?  not enough swap, when its 
trying to dump only 7000 some pages to a 700MB swap partiion that isn't used 
yet is missleading.
