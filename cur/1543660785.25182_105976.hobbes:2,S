Along with Rustys new module-init-tools (required to get started - I
downloaded mine from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/
 ) I had to apply
this patch:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104284883805276&w=2 to make
modules on 2.5.59 load without hard locking my kernel. I believe there's
newer/better versions of this fix on the list -- you might want to check the
archives.
