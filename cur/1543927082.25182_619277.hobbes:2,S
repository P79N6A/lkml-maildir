There is a kind of ongoing project to support the panel buttons in
FSC Lifebook laptops. This is another approach since the apanel driver
does not work for me. They are partly similar, though.
It seperates I2C chip support from the handling of the table
information. That improves readability a lot (at least for me) and
allows one driver per chip and reusability of those drivers.
The components include:
  * the oz99x driver to make the buttons on a Lifebook C-6637 work
  * the fjkeyinf driver to read the BIOS table information
The oz99x driver is independent of the fjkeyinf driver.
