Let's continue the analogy. Do you find useful to supply
NULL buffer to write() and some not-zero length?
I do not. And I see no differences between data buffer,
address buffer and ancillary data buffer and no reasons
to introduce code lines considering unnatural special cases.

Maybe, yes. Though, to be honest, it is rather recvfrom()/sendto()
should be fixed to be self-consistent 8)
BTW for beginning fix your program. 8)
