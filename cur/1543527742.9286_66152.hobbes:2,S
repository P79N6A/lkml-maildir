Perhaps it would be better for a "short spin" to actually perform all
the calculations of a schedule (goodness loop etc.), while checking to
see if it should abort.
That way the overhead of a real schedule() would be avoided when the
contention isn't that long, and when there is a schedule, most of the
hard work has been done already.
