This is exactly what I have been saying.

I don't know - I don't use zlib.
We can make LZO cleaner and perhaps faster. This will be good.

Yes. Many projects require LZO support and it might be getting
frustrating to delay  full-and-final code in kernel. I have been
extremely busy these days so I could not follow-up with authors
comments - also considering that some people want LZO patch split-up
into patch series which is highly cumbersome and time consuming in
this case.
I hoped that all of us can look into valuable feedback from author and
correct the issues he pointed out. This code duplication is really
pointless.

Yes there might still be problems - that is why I posted as RFC. I got
useful comments and the code is improving. Going for such fork might
be pain initially but IMHO its worth it. My idea for this 'fork' is
not just clean-ups but potential optimizations that such cleanups
usually bring along. I do not think there will be major overhauls in
such mature de/compression implementations so I believe its okay to go
for such 'fork' for sake of cleaner and perhaps faster code.

I have identified those memory alignment issues and working on same.
Due to time constraints it might take me a bit longer.

Again, I am working on improving the code as per feedback. This is
what I expect from RFC. Many people raised concerns regarding
bloatware in your patch too, including me.
