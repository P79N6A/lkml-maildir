 There is one issue here, although it does not happen within Linux,
seemingly.  If two different sources (e.g. two redirection entries of an
I/O APIC) issue a level triggered interrupt of the same vector in an
overlapping manner, due to the focus feature they will both be delivered
to the same CPU.  However the first remote IRQ source deactivation will
remove the IRQ request from the local APIC (i.e. the relevant IRR bit gets
cleared) regardless of the state of the other IRQ source.
