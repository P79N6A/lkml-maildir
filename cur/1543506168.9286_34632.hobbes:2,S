Hi
> Known problem in 2.2.11.  See

http://www.linux.org.uk/VERSION/relnotes.2211.html
 for details.
How is it that I'm not experiencing any of the problems in 2.2.11? I
don't get problems from tcp memory leaks and the vmware modules
compile perfectly even though they said they don't!
I patched from 2.2.9 to 2.2.11 - is it possible that this didn't work
properly? I didn't get any errors from patch and 'uname -r' and the
very first kernel message all report 2.2.11!
