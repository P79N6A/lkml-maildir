Sorry for the late response.
Yeah, the cmd_status is a very important thing.
The culprit of the problem is the simultaneous update of the status part of
the word by the card and the command part by the driver.
The problem can be relieved by atomic operations on the word.
However, e.g. the operations with "lock" prefix appear to be not sufficient:
experiments have proven it.  I'm not sure about cmpxchg.
It looks like that on x86 the problem can be solved by using 16-bit
operations on the proper part of the word.  But I'm not sure that in not-PC
world 16-bit operations have the same behavior.
Nevertheless, I'm aware of the problems and working on it.
