Yes it was private and you told me to be careful about "waving this patch 
around". No mention of not posting it.
And I repeat that I am sorry to have removed the paragraph that mentioned 
you being the author during rewrites of the text. Signoff line is there. 
This is an RFC so we can still add this if we want to apply it at all.
I think we need to discuss this openly. It seems that I am getting into 
unknown minefields of an ancient discussion between you and Andrew.
