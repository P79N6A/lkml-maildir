BUG() in 2.3.x is a nicer way to say *(int *)0 = 0 (and BUG() probably
will work also if the virtual address zero is mapped to a valid physical
page but that's not an issue for most code).

Fine thanks. I'll look into it ASAP.

Because with hex I understand without possible mistakes where the CPU was
running inside do_IRQ. (I don't need the System.map if the trace is long
enough)
>Will enabling CPU info be useful in my case?
No, the trace you sent should be just fine. I didn't known you was UP (and
the CPU info will never harm so I suggested you the safe way ;).
