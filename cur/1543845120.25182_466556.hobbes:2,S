Subject: Improvements in 2.6.18 will help SATA?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I'm an end user, not a developer. From:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.18
I see that a lot of the changes are related to SATA. I have a Seagate SATA HDD 
as my one and only HDD so if I will really be benefitting performance-wise 
from the new features or improvements, then I will install 2.6.18 over 
2.6.15. So please tell me as I am not able to decipher for myself, whether 
these improvements will lead to better performance, efficiency, speed or 
something like that on my SATA HDD.
Please don't be harsh with me if this question is way OT for this list. I 
thought only the developers can answer such a question so I asked here. I'm 
sincerely sorry if I am bothering anyone.
Please cc me as I am not on the list.
