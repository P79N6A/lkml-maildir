Subject: applesmc - sensors patch missing from 2.6.22-rc2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I wonder why the attached patch is missing from applesmc (written by
nicolas boichat) without which sensors simply won't work ...
( but these ones has been applied and are rather useless without the
attached one

I am using this for some weeks on 2.6.21 now without problems
