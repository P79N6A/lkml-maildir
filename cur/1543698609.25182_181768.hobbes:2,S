I did, but my vm knolege is rather limited.
I don't really know really know _where_ to place 
out_of_memory() in the new try_to_free_pages_zone()...
and what  other changes would be necessary in vmscan.c.
My try & error approach did not succeed.
I would be really glad if someone (aa may be :) could
provide the information where/how to place the call for a custom
(or the old) oom killer -  if it's really that simple ...
cheers,
pet
