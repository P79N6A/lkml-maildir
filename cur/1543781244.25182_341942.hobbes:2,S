All right, I'll see what I can come up with. This is quite a tall order.
1. A mechanism for creating virtual network interfaces
2. A mechanism for restricting binding to certain network interfaces
3. A mechanism for binding certain network interfaces.
4. The jail code itself
Much of the work is already done in other projects, but it requires grafting.
It seems much simpler to bind the jail's address to an network alias
(such as eth0:1),
and bind the jail to the address of the alias.
