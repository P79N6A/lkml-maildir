Hi everyone,
I have a question about the 64Bit mode in AMD 64bit
My question is if I run a 32Bit application in Optreon AMD 64Bit with
Linux 64Bit does this give my any benefit ? I mean running 32Bit
application in 64Bit machine with 64 Linux is it better that running
it in 32Bit or doesn't make any different at all ?
Thanks
