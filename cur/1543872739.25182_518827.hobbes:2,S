Since 2.6.20 /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/online isn't there anymore. The
directories exist, though. I also tested linux-2.6.21rc3. I had a look at the
archives and I found nothing about the removal of that file, which is still
documented in Documentation/cpu-hotplug.txt. I don't know if other
architectures are affected.
