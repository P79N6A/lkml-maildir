Because I hold in my hand "i486 Microprocessor Programmer's Reference 
Manual, c 1990", and it has no mention whatsoever of CR4, and all 
documentation I had until Friday had either no mention of CR4, or 
something to the effect of "new on Pentium, the CR4 register ..."  So 
I've had to re-adjust my definition of 486, which was weird.
