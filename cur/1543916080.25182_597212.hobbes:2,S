Hm, can you please run the test I've suggested in another branch of the
thread, ie.
# echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk
# echo disk > /sys/power/state
without your debugging code in disk.c?
This makes the hibernation code omit the major ACPI hooks, so if it works,
we'll know that these hooks are responsible for the problem.

Well, that seems less intrusive than changing the code ordering right before
the major kernel release, but I think we should do our best to understand what
_exactly_ is happening here.
