Perhaps "should be fine" but the test I just ran indicates otherwise.
The kernel is -V0.7.7 plus the patch you just sent me.
All IRQ and /# tasks were set to RT priority 99.
Started the X test and the display locked up almost immediately while
ping responses continued to flow on a regular basis. After several seconds
I could see the display update / move the mouse & then the display locked
up again. It went back and forth a couple cycles and did not get unstuck
until the RT audio application quit (over 250000 samples).
I will let it run to see if I can reproduce the deadlock or if the symptoms
change with one of the other tests.
