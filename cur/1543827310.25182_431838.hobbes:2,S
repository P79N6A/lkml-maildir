1. Would you mind to push this patch to -stable?
Reason: If killing a drive was hit in the field, this should be critical 
	enough.
2. Could you disable (at least optionally) read ahead complety 
  on the first IO error?
Reason: In a data recovery situation (hitting EIO quite often, 
	but not really sequentially) readahead is counter productive.
	E.g. trying to save an old CD with the cdparanoia software.
