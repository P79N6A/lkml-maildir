  Hello,
  I have a friend who connects his digital camera to computer via USB. In 2.4.17
everything worked ok but in 2.4.18 the device is detected by USB, SCSI prints
message about the device but no entries are created in /dev (he uses devfs). Also
when the camera is disconnected from the computer or when it's connected again
no message appears. Does anybody know where could be the problem?
								Thanks
									Honza
