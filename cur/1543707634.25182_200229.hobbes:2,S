Actually, I've got a better setup: instead of having a D_TENTATIVE flag in 
the dentry flags, just do
	#define TENTATIVE_INODE ((struct inode *) 1)
and just have "dentry->d_inode = TENTATIVE_INODE" for the dentries that 
were filled directly from "readdir()" data.
This not only avoids using a bit in the dentry flags, but it pretty much
guarantees that everybody is forced to use them correctly. It would be
very hard to have a buggy user: the dentry will clearly not be a negative
dentry (since d_inode is not NULL), but if anybody ever uses it as a
positive dentry, you'll get a nice and immediate oops.
So we'd see very quickly if these tentative dentries were to escape 
outside of __d_lookup().
