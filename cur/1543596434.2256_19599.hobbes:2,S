Looks like your system has an old version of modutils. You need Adrian
Bunk's linux-2.4 packages for running linux-2.4.* with Debian potato.
Add the following two lines to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb 
http://people.debian.org/~bunk/debian
 potato main
deb-src 
http://people.debian.org/~bunk/debian
 potato main
Now run 'apt-get update ; apt-get dist-upgrade' and rebuild the kernel.
