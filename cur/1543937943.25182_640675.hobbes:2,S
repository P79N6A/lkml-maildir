Actually it is already enabled on AMD. You check for is_cpu(INTEL)
but that just checks the generic MTRR architecture and all AMD CPUs
since K7 use that one too.
That is ok imho.
Perhaps it would be good to fix the incorrect comment though.

I see a failure here now on a (AMD) system where it trims a lot of memory, but
should probably not (or at least i haven't noticed any malfunction
before without it). Investigating.
