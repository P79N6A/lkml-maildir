Ok, I've been unable to do any testing for a few days, but today I had
some spare time and set my box to run my test script while doing some
other work. It was running latest git at the time of 2.6.19-rc2 + a
day or two and it locked up after ~20min.
So we are not so lucky that the problem has been fixed by some of the
patches that have gone in recently :-(
Since there was nothing in the system logs and the box was completely
frozen (not even sysrq worked) I goess I'll have to try and restart
the bisection.
Just wanted to report the little data I had. I'll be back with more
(hopefully soon).
