Yup. And whatever you create will be GPLed completely anyway.

Which is the prime question and has not yet been proved (not even in the
juristical meaning, let alone in the technical/mathematical) - neither
by you nor by SCO or anyone else. Even worse SCO is telling exactly that
since months (without providing detailed or even any reasonable
explanations that hold why one should believe in these words) and all
supporting (so-called) "facts" from SCO vanished and did not proove
anything.
BTW this lead to a verdict in Germany that disallows all of these claims
by SCO.
[ all of the propaganda removed ]
	Bernd, not believing your and/or SCOs empty claims
