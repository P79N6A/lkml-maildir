Subject: knfsd problem

X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/8/2/145

short form: need hints for debugging/gathering usefull information
long: client: plain 2.2.10, server: 2.2.10 + knfsd patches, knfsd 1.4.6
/home/install is exported readonly, no_root_squash, mounted as / via
nfsroot, and running a small bash script (read some input, run cfdisk,
then do automatic mkfs, mkswap, mount, untar, sed, lilo, umount, sync).
programs were not found, sometimes it worked till cfdisk, sometimes
much sooner everything stoped working. i could still give commands in bash,
but they were not found.
rebooting the server (killing the knfsd tasks did not kill them) and 
useing normal userland nfsd -> everything works as usual.
dmesg showed no warnings (related to that machine/files).
