Physical temperature reading of exhaust from primary cooling fan and the regular triggering of secondary cooling fan confirms this (it is not a readout scaling issue). The kernels and temps below:

CPU frequency scaling not working perhaps? What's your dmesg output from 
bootup look like? Is the acpi-cpufreq driver being loaded?
