Please download libsmbios 0.10.0-beta1 and send the "dumpCmos" output
from your machine. Please send it to the libsmbios devel mailing list.
>From that output, I can tell you if this token is available on that
machine. If that token is available, then yes, you can set that feature.
libsmbios can be obtained from 
http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios/main/
dumpCmos is part of "make minimal", so you don't need any other libs
present to compile. It is found under bins/output/ after compile.
(alternatively, install the libs and bins rpms)
