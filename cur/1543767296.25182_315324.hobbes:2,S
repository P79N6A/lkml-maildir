I did preliminary testing of the patch applied to the rc3 on the IA-32
ES7000, and it booted fine, without the useapictimer boot option. As
Zwane pointed out correctly, ES7000 doesn't handle IRQ broadcast. The
kernel by-passed the non-apic timer option (chose pin1 in check_timer)
and came up safely with local APIC timer.
