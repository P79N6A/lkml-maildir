In kbuild quite a lot of effort has been done to make life easier
for those dealing with external modules. There are several
reasons to deal with external modules:
- Alpha stage module that is not yet ready for kernel inclusion
- Special stuff that does not belong in the kernel for som reason
- Experimental stuff of any kind
This covers maybe one fifth of all external modules but that is enough
to make proper support anyway.
That said I continue to be mystified over how much effort the external
module people put into avoiding using kbuild.
I have even seen external modules that mixed up proper kbuild
supported modules and old 2.4 style modules in the same Makefile.
And the effort trying to deal with vermagic stuff in external modules,
inspecting CFLAGS setting etc. is just countless :-(
But that does not change my point about giving these people a proper
warning in at least one kernel release.
