Thanks for the pointer.
FYI, that URL didn't work for me.  This one did:
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs/dist/files/source/RHAT/RHAS3/coreutils-4.5.3-33.src.rpm
Whoever maintains that code should consider merging their changes with
something newer.  There are over 500 lines of NEWS entries alone for the
coreutils releases that have been made since 4.5.3.
Besides, those patches have portability and robustness problems,
and they aren't even based on coreutils-4.5.3.  Maybe they're
based on some vendor's version of coreutils?

As far as I know, no one ever submitted such O_DIRECT-based patches
to me or any of the bug-*@gnu.org mailing lists.
The only pending O_DIRECT-based patch is one for shred.
Clean, complete, and well-justified patches usually go in pretty quickly.
