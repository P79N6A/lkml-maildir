Thanks for reminding me about it ;)

I didn't, I actually hoped it would work with older twisted too ;)

You don't need to reboot them, however I can't trust past uptimes or it
would be way too easy to fake the results (it's still easy but it takes
a lot more effort).

This is the objective yes.

So it sounds like the next thing to do is to extend the protocol to add
an _optional_ reporting of more info on the subsystems and hardware
involved (turned off by default). About the oopses that will require
kernel changes, and as per previous emails that'd be a very interesting
feature to enable optionally too (via sysctl etc..).
The old protocol (number 0) will stay, infact that will remain the
default.
Thanks.
