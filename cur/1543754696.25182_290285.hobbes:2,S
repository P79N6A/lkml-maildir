About the only kernel-level enforcement I would feel comfortable with is
to have non-fixed mmap()s refuse to grab the _page_ at address 0. Any range
larger than this is policy, and hence needs a user-space override mechanism.
Also, if user-space wants to catch accesses in a larger region above 0 then
it can do that itself, by checking the result of mmap(), or by doing a fixed
mmap() at address 0 with suitable size and rwx protection disabled.
