Note that this is certainly new to the newer intel CPU's.
Older intel CPU's not only killed the pipe on a TLB miss, they also did
all TLB handling uncached - so that a regular TLB miss cost was
basically the cost of (twice) bringing something in from the L2. 
If they indeed do it in three cycles without a stall, that's a
surprisingly _huge_ improvement for them. Good show.
