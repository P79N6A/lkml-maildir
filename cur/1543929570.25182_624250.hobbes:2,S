Ingo,
This series applies on GIT commit 2254c2e0184c603f92fc9b81016ff4bb53da622d
(2.6.24-rc4 (ish) git HEAD)
These patches replace v6 + v6b announced here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/20/613
 and
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/21/226
The series is a collaborative effort between myself and Steven Rostedt.
Changes since v6:
*) cleaned up patch headers
*) fixed some checkpatch errors
*) incorporated v6<x> add-ons to one unified series
Synopsis:
---------------------
Most people don't care about RT tasks, but some of us do, and this series
helps us fix a problem with the current design.  We designed carefully to have
negligible impact on non RT code paths, and we believe we have achieved this
goal.
These tests against a 64-way SMP architecture show that the series doesn't
hurt those that don't care about RT tasks, but it helps out those that do.
