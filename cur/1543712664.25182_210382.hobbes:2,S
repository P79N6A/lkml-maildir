After more than a year (or two?) of discussions there's no better idea
yet than giving a userspace hint. Default should be to balance at
exec(), and maybe use a syscall for saying: balance all children a
particular process is going to fork/clone at creation time. Everybody
reached the insight that we can't foresee what's optimal, so there is
only one solution: control the behavior. Give the user a tool to
improve the performance. Just a small inheritable variable in the task
structure is enough. Whether you give the hint at or before run-time
or even at compile-time is not really the point...
I don't think it's worth to wait and hope that somebody shows up with
a magic algorithm which balances every kind of job optimally.

The current code isn't a result of a big optimization effort, it's the
result of stripping stuff down to something which was acceptable at
all in the 2.6 feature freeze phase such that we get at least _some_
NUMA scheduler infrastructure. It was clear right from the beginning
that it has to be extended to really become useful.

That is not true in the case of HPC applications. And if someone uses
OpenMP he is just doing that kind of stuff. I consider STREAM a good
benchmark because it shows exactly the problem of HPC applications:
they need a lot of memory bandwidth, they don't run in cache and the
tasks live really long. Spreading those tasks across the nodes gives
me more bandwidth per task and I accumulate the positive effect
because the tasks run for hours or days. It's a simple and clear case
where the scheduler should be improved.
Benchmarks simulating "user work" like SPECsdet, kernel compile, AIM7
are not relevant for HPC. In a compute center it actually doesn't
matter much whether some shell command returns 10% faster, it just
shouldn't disturb my super simulation code for which I bought an
expensive NUMA box.
