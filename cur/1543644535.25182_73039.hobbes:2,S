This is not a valid example.  We do not make tradeoffs between 
performance and reliability.  Reliability _always_ comes first.  If it 
did not, it's a bug.

What exactly does this mean?  Can you give a concrete example of taking 
an existing driver and updating it for that last few percent?
[I venture to guess that Intel doesn't know yet what is necessary, but 
that's just a guess.]

It depends on what needs to be "enforced."  If its compliance to 
existing APIs, that's pretty much a given.  Non-compliance would be a bug.

That's still not a concrete example :)  We already knew you were talking 
about drivers.
Does Intel even have --one-- example of a driver that could be hardened?
It seems to me Intel is writing a spec for an abstract objective, IOW 
writing a solution when the problem hasn't even been defined yet. 
Please define the problem ("<this> API needs updating to harden 
drivers") not the solution ("add <this> API and drivers will be hardened").
Finally, and this bears repeating -- I am very encouraged by Intel's 
participation, and initiative in hardening Linux drivers.  I actively 
encourage this effort, and think that Intel's resources can 
[potentially] dramatically improve the overall quality of Linux kernel 
drivers.  Guys, you have an excellent opportunity here ;-)  Please 
listen to the feedback from kernel developers, we are the guys in the 
trenches doing the Real Life software engineering day in and day out.
