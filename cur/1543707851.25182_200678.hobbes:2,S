Subject: [PATCH] Fix use of sector_t in swim3 driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi !
This driver won't build with CONFIG_LBD due to a 64 bits division.
Use the "simple" fix of a cast down to 32 bits, this is only
a floppy driver, no need to do sector_div.
Please, apply.
Ben.
