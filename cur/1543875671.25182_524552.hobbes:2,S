You may have a point there.  It isn't important at this point, and
it is easy enough to fix at this point.

Migrating IRQS gets called from the irq handler.  So I guess in that
sense it qualifies as a fast path operation.   The actual irq migration
itself is time consuming even if the individual operations aren't.  In
large part because ioapics don't appear to obey pci ordering rules so
flushing pending irqs is black magic :(
The comparative low frequency is important.
I guess what I meant is as soon as the test to for IRQ_MOVE_PENDING
is true we need to migrate an irq so we branch off of the fast path,
and irq handling path, where we do what we have to make things
work and the cost is what it takes to be reliable.

If true I think that would be bad.  However I don't see it.
Where in handle_edge_irq do we mask the interrupt?
The only place I see us calling ->mask is from move_native_irq
and that only if IRQ_MOVE_PENDING is true.
All I can see is us routinely calling is ack_APIC_edge.

Agreed.  However the driver should not have any access to the mask method
in any shape or form.  That is an internal irq implementation helper.

Please point at code because you are reading the code quite differently
from myself, and I think I have been over that code enough times to see
how it operates.
