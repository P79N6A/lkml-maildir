I am not sure if it is the case:
1. I can access the web site in question on the Linux router.
2. Here is the slip interface on the router:
# ifconfig sl0
sl0       Link encap:VJ Serial Line IP  
          inet addr:209.249.10.145  P-t-P:209.249.10.10  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:576  Metric:1
          RX packets:2182 errors:0 dropped:5 overruns:1190 frame:1
             compressed:0
          TX packets:2001 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:1069 carrier:0
          collisions:8 compressed:0 
On the remote slip site:
# ifconfig sl0
sl0       Link encap:VJ Serial Line IP  
          inet addr:209.249.10.10  P-t-P:209.249.10.145  Mask:255.255.255.248
          UP POINTOPOINT NOTRAILERS RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:576  Metric:1
          RX packets:158898 errors:2049 dropped:0 compressed:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 compressed:284488
Everything seems to match. The only difference is I don't have
NOTRAILERS.
Thanks.
