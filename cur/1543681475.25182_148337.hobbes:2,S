It will truncate it at runtime.
I suggest
	dmatimer.expires = jiffies + HZ/2;
Also, you you need to use the time_before() macro, like
	while ( time_before(jiffies, dmatimer.expires) )
            do_something();
... so you don't have a timer-wrap problem during jiffie rollover if
you haven't already done so (I don't have your source here).

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
