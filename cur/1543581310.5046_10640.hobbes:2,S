	Ah!  But now you are placing conditions on it (that at least one
pair is local).  That is the very fine distinction that makes up the
"not quite" in the "almost" above and the difference between the "should
not" vs the "must not" in the specifications.  You basically can't qualify
it by saying "you can do this, but only if one pair is in the same SOA".
