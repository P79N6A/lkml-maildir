Please listen, I said you should export it in /proc/<pid>/mounts, which is
an ASCII interface and any half-sane parser does not depend on the width
of the field in the kernel.
Can we please get rid of the broken ioctl now so it doesn't become part
of the ABI and you'll add the trivial output to /proc/<pid>/mounts?
