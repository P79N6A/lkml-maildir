Serious question: which kernel threads would actually want to be
frozen?
Threads that do no I/O at all don't care about suspend/resume and
don't need to be frozen in any case.  Threads that issue I/O requests
in order to service incoming I/O requests can't be frozen because of
the possibility of deadlock.  Which leaves threads that do I/O just
for the fun of it. :)
What am I missing?

I believe the distinction between threads and user processes is a
false one, because user processes can now do things that were formerly
only doable by kernel threads.

Do you know which drivers they are?  I'm happy to help hack things
into shape.

I don't know how you can make the freezer completely deadlock-free
while still providing the guarantee that some drivers currently need,
without constructing the dependency graph I mentioned.
