Subject: Help: kernel option root=/dev/nfs failing 2.6.10

I am attempting to create network bootable system with 2.6.10 and nfs and am
having trouble.
I am using grub and the boot goes without a hitch until the kernel attempts
to use the commands I've sent.
<SNIP from grub.conf>
bootp
root (nd)
kernel (nd)/redhat-2.6.10/kernel root=/dev/nfs ip=bootp
nfsroot=10.0.120.1:/diskless/redhat-2.6.10/
baseos
</SNIP>
Network booting machine X does fine until. It attempts to open the root
device.
<SNIP>
VFS: Cannot open root device "nfs" or unknown-block(0,255) Please append a
correct "root=" boot option Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount
root fs on unknown-block(0,255) </SNIP>
It looks like the kernel isn't recognizing the virtual device /dev/nfs but
I've enabled all the NFS options and everything is compiled into the kernel.
Any ideas?
Thanks
Haven
