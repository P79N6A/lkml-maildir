Maybe it's simply *old* code, possibly written under libc5.
There, signal() used SA_RESETHAND which implies SA_NODEFER
which in turn did not block the signal and exiting from the
signal handler via longjmp was OK.
With the new signal() behaviour in glibc2 one may get results
undefined by POSIX but it still worked as before because the
sigprocmask was ignored for SIGSEGV under Linux <2.6.
It's the combination of new glibc2 and new kernel that makes
code like the mentioned one break.
It has nothing to do with POSIX - for POSIX all of this is
"undefined/implementation defined behaviour".  I had chosen
to stay compatible...
Ciao, ET.
