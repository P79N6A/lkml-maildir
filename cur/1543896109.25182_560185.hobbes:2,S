The really annoying things are the one-off things. You've been happily 
working for a while (never even being _close_ to saturatign any IO 
queues), and then you untar a large tree.
If the kernel now let's you dirty lots of memory, you'll have a very 
unpleasant experience.
And with hot-pluggable devices (which is where most of the throughput 
problems tend to be!), the "one-off" thing is not a "just after reboot" 
kind of situation.
So you'd have to be pretty smart about it.
