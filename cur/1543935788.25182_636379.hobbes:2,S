Because binary drivers don't use ioread/iowrite/readX/writeX (or if they
do, they've long been inlined in the blob). The only solution is to map
things as non-accessible and trap the page faults.
It's a sane thing to do, Christoph, I don't think it's a unreasonable
request to put the hooks back in.
