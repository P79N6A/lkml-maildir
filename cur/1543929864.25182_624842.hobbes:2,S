I too once battled with the moral dilemma of freeing in programs that exit.
Then in 2001, I was moving out of a house which was to be demolished.  The 
landlord insisted that we pay for the carpets to be cleaned.  My wife still 
uses it as a canonical example of wasteful idiocy.
So I hope this has contributed to your enlightenment, as it did to mine.
