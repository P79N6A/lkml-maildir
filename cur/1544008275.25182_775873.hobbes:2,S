Sure, I can add some comments outlining future developments in 
v4l2-device.h and v4l2-subdev.h. The v4l2-framework document can point 
to those headers (headers are easier to keep in sync when new features 
arrive than documentation).
But I'll wait with this until I get Mauro's review back, just in case 
there are more changes for me to do.
