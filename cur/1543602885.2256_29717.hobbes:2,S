Subject: 2.4.9-ac10 IDE access slows as uptime increases

   I've been noticing this for months, and thought I was crazy. But I
just verified it.
   I ran a program that's a GUI app/front-end to a data base, on the
local drives. It took seconds to access a record.
   Rebooted. Ran the same thing again. The program accessed records
almost instantly.
   I get faster response time from the 2.2.20-pre2 systems over 100MBs
NFS than I do on the 2.4 system after it has been running for a few
hours. NFS is slow enough, usually use ssh and run the program on the DB
system. (Only use a local copy when testing.)
   Use the system mostly to compile, debug and test.

All those users are me, logged into different xterms, most of which are
not being used during the uptime.
   XFree86 4.0.3. Using nVidia drivers. I really don't remember if the
problem was there when I was using an Athlon similarly configured except
for a Voodoo3 and 3/4 the RAM. Had so many problems with the Athlon, I
gave it to a co-worker who doesn't use their box as heavily as I do.
They haven't had any problems with the Athlon.
   I seem to remember this as a problem on the Athlon, too, but won't
swear to it because there were too many other things going on and this
is the first time I actually checked to see if the slowdown was real.
   Also have VMware modules loaded all the time. Don't always use it
every day though, and still see the slowdown. The system is rebooted
each morning right now, most of the time (unless I just forget). The
slowdown doesn't just affect the data base program. Its just really
noticeable there.
   Config attached. Any ideas how to check this out further?
