Well this does not count, but the oldest file and directory on the oldest
Linux-Box (original) is 
'-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            4 Feb 23  1993 NETWORKING'
'drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root         1024 Jan 28  1994 setup'
This machine has been up and down for kernel updates, but I know it has
run continuously (except for extended power outages) since the install
of an 'aout' kernel.........somewhere around Slackware 2.3.
'-rw-r--r--   1 root     root          154 Aug 20  1994 exports'
Is the oldest file that I can remember editing.
