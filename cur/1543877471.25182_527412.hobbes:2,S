If we're going to consider this seriously, there is a case I know of.
Look at flush_dcache_page()'s test for ZERO_PAGE() on sparc64, there
is an instructive comment:
	/* Do not bother with the expensive D-cache flush if it
	 * is merely the zero page.  The 'bigcore' testcase in GDB
	 * causes this case to run millions of times.
	 */
	if (page == ZERO_PAGE(0))
		return;
basically what the GDB test case does it mmap() an enormous anonymous
area, not touch it, then dump core.
As I understand the patch being considered to remove ZERO_PAGE(), this
kind of core dump will cause a lot of pages to be allocated, probably
eating up a lot of system time as well as memory.
