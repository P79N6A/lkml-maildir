what about CryptoAPI is so expensive that you can't use a stack-based
context?
this seems pretty dumb converting a stack-based md5 context to multiple
instances in multiple structures.
the stack is almost guaranteed to be in L1 cache.
multiplying that structure by N connections is just a waste of memory
bandwidth.  not to mention the locking crud you seem to need to do... the
stack is implicitly locked.
is CryptoAPI really this broken?
