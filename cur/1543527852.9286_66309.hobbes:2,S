Subject: Odd NFS behaviour

I get an odd NFS behaviour.  Let's say I have my home directory mapped at
/nfssrv/home, then I would see all my subdirectories under /nfssrv/home, but
when I 'cd' into one of the sub-directories (i.e. /nfssrv/home/src) and do an
'ls' it shows nothing.  I've seen this on redhat 6.0 (kernel-2.2.5), it
looked like the bug went away, but now I see it on 2.3.42.  Has anybody
seen this before?
Thanks
Andrew Park
