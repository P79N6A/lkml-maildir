I have to agree with Eric that sizing the max timeslices to fit the
hardware seems like a reasonable thing to do. I have little salvaged
systems running (well strolling would be more accurate) Linux on old
Pentium Classic 90-166MHz machines. I also have 3+ GHz SMP machines. I
have a gut feeling that the timeslices need to be longer on the slow
machines to allow them to get something done, that the SMP machines
will perform best with a different timeslice than UP of the same speed,
etc.
I think you also want a user tunable for throughput vs. interactive, so
you know what you're trying to do best.
Perhaps some counting of wait time between dispatches would be useful,
and drop the timeslices to keep that limited. Sort of a "deadline CPU
scheduler" with limiting bounds. That might at least give some hope of
compensating for CPU speed changes after boot.
