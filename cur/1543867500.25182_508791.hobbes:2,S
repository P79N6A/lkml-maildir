That patch adds a bunch of memory dereferences and another allocation 
to the thread creation code path -- a tax that all users must pay.  Granted, 
it's small, but at the very least should be configurable out for the 99.9% 
of users that will never use this functionality.
I'm willing to be convinced, it's just that I would like to see some 
numbers that scream out that this is a good thing.
