I thought I did - "bounded latency" is the heart of it.  Maybe I'm the
one that's out of step with the rest of the world ;-))
This is now rather a long way off topic, so I think I'll be dropping it.

Lest I mislead anyone about my meaning: I personally would not attempt
"real" aka "hard" aka "realtime" realtime on a vanilla Linux box (at
least not if I cared about the outcome ;-)).  I was addressing a generic
RT point, and that's why I'm going to drop it...
