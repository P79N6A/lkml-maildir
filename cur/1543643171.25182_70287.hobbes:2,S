Subject: [PATCH] fcntl.h consolidation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

New version of the fcntl.h consolidation.  This time,
linux/fcntl.h is a set of default values and structures that
are overridden in the asm/fcntl.h files.
The intention is to stop from happenning what happened to
PPC and PPC64 - which are arbitrarily different but only in
a couple of the defines.
In each case, I have taken the most popular definition among all
the architectures for linux/fcntl.h (this happens to reduce
asm-i386/fcntl.h and a couple of others to effectively empty).
The patch is at
