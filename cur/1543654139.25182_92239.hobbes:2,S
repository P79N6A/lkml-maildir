Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

James, all,
	Ok, again, this patch tries to cleanup the subarch directories by
splitting up the .h files and moving them into
include/asm-i386/mach-xyz. It also lets the build fall back to the
default .h files in include/asm-i386/mach-default (renamed from
mach-generic as Alan suggested). 
Most of the patch is very boring file moves, so I've bziped and attached
it below. I've also inlined the Makefile changes as they are at least a
bit more interesting.
If there are no further comments, I'll re-submit w/o the rfc bit. 
thanks
