I won't disagree with your experiences.  For me, outside of one brief 
moment when the r8169 driver didn't work on Athlon64, it has worked 
flawlessly for me.
RealTek 8169 is currently my favorite gigabit chip.
WRT Marvell Yukon, make sure it is not the Yukon2.  Yukon2 isn't 
supported by any driver in the kernel, presently.
