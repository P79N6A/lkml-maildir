Things like raid, now file mapping functionality. I'm sure there are
more examples, it's how dm was always developed probably originating
back to when they developed mostly out of tree. And I think it's a bad
idea, we don't want duplicate functionality. If something is wrong with
loop, fix it, don't write dm-loop.

If loop.c is a problem, I'd rather see a newloop.c (with a better name,
of course) that we can transition to.

Well mine didn't exist 4 days ago, I was just listing missing
functionality.

I know that's your opinion, I reserve the right to have my own on where
this functionality belongs :)
