The easy way out is to unpack the initrd, fix permissions, and repack. That
requires root, though (it creates devices).

I'd use sudo(1) + specially cooked commands to unpack/pack an initrd. It is
a bit more work, but gives you extra flexibility (i.e., not just futzing
around with permissions, can also add/replace/edit/rename/delete files, ...
using bog standard tools).
