The problem is pretty nasty unfortunately. To solve it properly I think
the file_operations->read/write prototypes would need to be changed
because otherwise it is not possible to do atomic relative updates
of f_pos. Right now the actual update is burrowed deeply in the low level 
read/write implementation. But that would be a huge impact all over
the tree :/
Or maybe define a new read/write64 and keep the default as 32bit only-- i 
suppose most users don't really need 64bit. Still would be a nasty API 
change.
