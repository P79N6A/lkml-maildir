Good.
(a minor disclaimer :)
We discussed it a bit with Ingo and I don't remember who first
expressed this idea in written words (although I seem to remember, I
did have it in mind before -- it's not rocket science after all :)

Well, as a _temporary_ stub - just return the 'raw_weighted_load'
contributed by the RT tasks..
Ideally, we'd like a similar approach to the update_fair_load() --
i.e. we need the run-time history of rt_sched_class's (like of any
other class) tasks over the last sampling period, so e.g. we do
account periodic RT tasks which happen to escape accounting through
'raw_weghted_load' due to the fact that they are not active at the
moment of timer interrupts (when 'raw_weighted_load' snapshots are
taken).

just substitute {exec,fair}_delta == 1 in the following code:
        tmp64 = SCHED_LOAD_SCALE * exec_delta64;
        do_div(tmp64, fair_delta);
        tmp64 *= exec_delta64;
        do_div(tmp64, TICK_NSEC);
        this_load = (unsigned long)tmp64;
we'd get
        tmp64 = 1024 * 1;
        tmp64 =/ 1;
        tmp64 *= 1;
        tmp64 /= 1000000;
as a result, this_load = 1024/1000000; which is 0 (no floating point calc.).

The raw idea behind update_load_fair() is that it evaluates the
run-time history between 2 consequent calls to it (which is now at
timer freq. --- that's a sapling period). So if you call
update_fair_load() in a loop, the sampling period is actually an
interval between 2 consequent calls. IOW, you can't say "3 ticks were
lost" so at first evaluate the load for the first tick, then the
second one, etc. ...
Anyway, I'm missing the details regarding the way you are going to do
per-group 'load balancing' so refrain from further commenting so
far... it's just that the current implementation of update_load_fair()
is unlikely to work as you expect in your 'replay lost ticks' loop :-)

Ok, let's say user1 tasks were highly active till T1 moment of time..
cpu_load[] of user's lrq
has accumulated this load.
now user's tasks were not active for an interval of dT.. so you don't
update its cpu_load[] in the mean time? Let's say 'load balancing'
takes place at the moment T2 = T1 + dT
Are you going to do any 'load balancing' between users? Based on what?
If it's user's lrq :: cpu_load[] .. then it _still_ shows the load at
the moment of T1 while we are at the moment T2 (and user1 was not
active during dT)..
