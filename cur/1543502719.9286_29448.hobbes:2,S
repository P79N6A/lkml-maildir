That's fine but it's completly broken right now and if I'm reading
correctly no one seems to know how to fix it with the new buffer changes.
I need vfat more than I need a magical conversion system that doesn't
work when I need it most anyhow.
You shouldn't need to change anything else on your system even with this
thing's removal since there are many cases where you can get dos text
files that aren't on a dos/windows fs.
I can't upgrade untill I can mount dos filesystems.  Perhapse you
would like to take a stab at it since your most vocal about the need to
keep the bloat?

PS I won't care if the conversion disapears I _WILL_ care if this stuff is  
still broken come 2.4.0.
