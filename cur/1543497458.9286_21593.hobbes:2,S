   * I did not remove the initialize_secondary() functions
   from arch/{alpha, ppc, sparc, sparc64} because
   I've heard that the most up to date versions
   are maintained in individual CVS trees.
This is really not the case anymore, we're pretty synchronized at this
point.
And at worst, us port maintainers just merge your changes into our
tree when we sync up with the next release.  In the end, changes do
not get lost, which is the important bit.
Later,
