I'd just like to say that last time I tested CFS it was very slow
on context switching. I don't know if this has been improved, but I
think it should be.
I'm not talking about context switching with heaps of tasks, but
about lmbench 2-task ping pongs and such.
Also it used pretty small timeslices to achieve interactivity, which
didn't seem like a good idea. I wonder if that's been fixed?
