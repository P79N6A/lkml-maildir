Brad,
I'm running an ASUS A7N8X Deluxe mobo (nforce2 chipset) and still
getting hardlockups.  I applied your patch but my system still locked
up after about a day.  However 2.6.0-test5 seems to be stable.  I have
had my system up for over three weeks with APIC and ACPI turned on.
Just to let you know,
Ross
