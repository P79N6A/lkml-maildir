Do you have any form of automation when dealing with breaking drivers?
If I could reduce the necessary time for creating a working
allyesconfig, that would be quite nice.
Allyesconfig has a couple of advantages. The analysis of object files
is must simpler with just vmlinux to worry about. And some errors
don't show up until link time, not sure if you can catch all of them
with allmodconfig.
