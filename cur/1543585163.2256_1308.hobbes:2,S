I've found a good exercise for exercising memory faults is to recompile
the kernel with a -j16 flag; and in a second virtual console, do something
like dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=2048k
Either the kernel compile will fail with a sig11, or the dd will fail and
lock the system, in my experience.
I've used this method, crudely, to chase down memory problems in systems
using 256-512MB ram.
YMMV.
