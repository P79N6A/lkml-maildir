Can you not load the usb-storage driver, load the usbcore module, and
the USB host driver that you are using, and point hotplug to somewhere
else:
	echo /bin/true > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
Then plug in your device, and send the output of /proc/bus/usb/devices
to the list (and the linux-usb-devel list, which is a better place for
this :)

Did you set it up properly?  See the Linux USB Guide at
http://www.linux-usb.org/
 for info on how to do it.
