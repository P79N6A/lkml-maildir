The iTLB would be flushed when he did the reload of cr3 ( per your
suggestion ) UNLESS the G bit was set.
I suppose theres some small chance, that at the time this instruction was
first cached and its corresponding iTLB entry was loaded, the G bit may
have been set.. Seems unlikely. but I'll hack up something to
unconditionally flush the iTLB.

Or somehow the I/D TLB's got messed up and the ITLB for that entry is now
wrong.
