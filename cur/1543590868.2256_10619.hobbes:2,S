From what I remember, 3c590 was a horribly buggy card that sometimes
broke even in workstation use (possibly fixed by driver updates more
recently). 3c905B and later are fine, I'm not sure if the original
905 had any bad issues. The original ones definately won't do zero-copy.
The tulips from that era work pretty reliably. Some of the older ones
just won't do autonegotiation (I've seen this with an old 
SMC with both 10/100baseTX and 9-pin "for use with token ring cabling"
connectors). Forcing the link speed works just fine, though.
