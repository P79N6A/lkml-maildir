Hi Ismail,
it would be great if you'd be able to isolate what is the cause in a 
little more detailed way - i.e. try a different network card in the same 
machine, try a different bluetooth mouse in the same machine, try the very 
same mouse and network card in a different machine, etc.
Otherwise I am afraid this is going to be just a totally wild guessing.
Thanks,
