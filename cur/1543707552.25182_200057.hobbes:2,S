Hi!
There I have a Soekris bord with some weird PCI Handup while booting
Linux during PCI-Scan .
# lspci
00:00.0 Host bridge: Cyrix Corporation PCI Master
00:12.0 ISA bridge: National Semiconductor Corporation: Unknown device 0510
00:12.1 Bridge: National Semiconductor Corporation: Unknown device 0511
00:12.2 IDE interface: National Semiconductor Corporation SCx200 IDE (rev 01)
00:12.5 Bridge: National Semiconductor Corporation: Unknown device 0515
00:13.0 USB Controller: Compaq Computer Corporation ZFMicro Chipset USB (rev 08)
There was a patch on 2.4.x which worked fine.
Now I tried to patch Kernel 2.6.x - well I'm no programmer
- I had no idea where to put it ... so I started putting some debug
messages into some files ... and suddenly including a printk(".") into
drivers/pci/probe.c fixed the whole PCI-Hangup ??? - That was not what the
2.4.x Patch did.
Hmmm ...
I've no idea why that printk fixes the Problem nor if it's a good idea to
have that printk there ...
Regards
