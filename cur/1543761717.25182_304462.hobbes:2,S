Yup, audio works fine, this is why I never noticed. Also, the external midi 
interface also works fine. Digging around, /proc/asound/card0/audiopci says 
"Joystick enable: off, Joystick port: 0x200". 
I've also been looking through alsa's cvs for alsa-kernel, and I can't see any 
changes that might have broken it.
Also, I have a usb gamepad that currently works fine.
