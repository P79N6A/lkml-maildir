* Fixed variables have to be in a separate source file.
* They have to be maintained separately from the main code that uses
  them.
* Either the fixed variables are always compiled into the kernel or the
  source that defines the fixed variables is wrapped in #ifdef
  CONFIG_...
* The source that defines the fixed variables has to include lots of .h
  files to get all the variable types.
All of the above used to be done, see the 2.2 init/main.c code.  But it
is difficult to maintain and was replaced by __init code in 2.3.
