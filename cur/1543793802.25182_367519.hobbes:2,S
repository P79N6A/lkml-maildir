I tried running "Xorg -configure" on my alpha (EV56) with Linux kernel
2.6.15-rc1 and got the following error message: "xf86EnableIOPorts:
Failed to set IOPL for I/O". I checked the kernel log and found the
following error message:
Nov 16 06:38:49 [kernel] [4394179.238460] program Xorg is using
MAP_PRIVATE, PROT_WRITE mprotect of VM_RESERVED memory, which is
deprecated. Please report this to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
If you need any further information or would like me to test anything,
feel free to contact me.
