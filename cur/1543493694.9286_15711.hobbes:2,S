I'm looking for a project that fits the following criteria:
1) Is harder than it sounds
2) Isn't very important
3) Teaches me something
4) Is fun.
As such I've decided I'm going to try and build a quiet boot option
for the kernel, that is one that displays MINIMAL output to the
screen, and instead dumps it all to a log file. So I guess what I am asking is 
a) Has anyone previously attempted this? I know there was talk of it
in the past.  
b) Anyone want to point me in the right direction? I figure this is
probably mainly a change in the behavior of printk and friends
c) Comments, misc.?
