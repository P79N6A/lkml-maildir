That's currently implemented via this:
	/*
	 * We need to reference all the pages for this order, otherwise if
	 * anyone accesses one of the pages with (get/put) it will be freed.
	 */
	for (i = 0; i < (1 << order); i++)
		set_page_count(page+i, 1);
I assume the CONFIG_MMU logic assumes that it's legal to physically free a
single page from inside the middle of a higher-order page.  I wonder if the
no-buddy-bitmap patches allow that?  And if they've been tested with that?
See, if we enable the compound page logic if !CONFIG_MMU then all this
stuff just goes away and the page refcounting is controlled purely by the
head page.  A get_page() or a put_page() against any of the constituent
pages will manipulate the head page's refcount.

OK.
