...Thats why I said i didn't want to start another geometry war. But
then again, I did write RFC too, yes?
Yes, geometry is a fiction. And a bad one at that. To be honest I'd
rather get rid of it completely. But you said it: The geometry still
exists for the sake of backward compatibility. If it is still there, why
not export it? That's what sysfs is for...
Additionally have a look at libata-scsi.c which is part of the SATA
implementation. Theres CHS code in there...
Personally I want the geometry information in sysfs because debugging
partition tables not written by linux tools becomes just that tad more
easier...

I did not say I'd implement it for _all_ devices. In fact I indent to
make geometry available only for devices whose drivers provide the
getgeo function.

Exactly. I don't want the kernel to fix BIOS problems. But i want to
give userland the opportunity to overwrite what the kernel thinks (as in
/proc/ide/hdx/settings).
One example where this might be usable is connecting a PATA drive using
an Adapter to SATA. PATA returns the drive's geometry. SATA defaults to
x/255/63...
