Doing more runs and a more thorough analysis has driven me to a
different conclusion.  The important result is that *neither* nice-20
*nor* SCHED_ISO work properly in their current forms.
For further comparison, I booted an old 2.4.19 kernel with Andrew
Morton's low-latency patches and ran the same test SCHED_FIFO, with
and without background compiles.  The results were roughly the same as
SCHED_FIFO on 2.6.11-rc1...

+compile
In addition, I extracted some across the board information by grepping
for key results.  Looking at these numbers in aggregate paints a
pretty convincing picture that neither of the new scheduler prototypes
are performing adequately compared to SCHED_FIFO on either 2.4ll or
2.6.

Looking at delay_max broken down by directory is particularly
striking.  Below, I grouped the values by scheduling class to show the
striking differences.  These kinds of worst-case numbers are what
realtime applications designers are generally most interested in...

Looked at this way, there really is no question.  The new scheduler
prototypes are falling short significantly.  Could this be due to
their lack of priority distinctions between realtime threads?  Maybe.
I can't say for sure.  I'll be interested to see what happens when Con
is ready for me to try his new priority-based SCHED_ISO prototype.
On a different note, the fact that 2.6 is finally performing as well
as 2.4+lowlat on this test represents significant progress.  In fact,
it performed slightly better (I don't know whether that improvement is
statistically significant).
Congratulations to all who had a hand in making this happen!
