If I've got the numbering right;
	0 - concatenated stripes => no sync required
	1 - mirrored => resync required
		a: which drive has the correct info?
		b: having determined that, read the correct block,
		   it must now be written to the mirror.
	all others => resync required (rebuild possible bad block)

My experience has been with hardware raid, and even then there has been
a 1-5% decrease in I/O during resync (not accurately measured - fsck took
longer, and then only when the channel is maxed out -- otherwise the 1-5% is
not visible; filesystem was 3 IRIX efs, spread across two raid luns).
fsck is particularly bad, since nearly every read instigates a write to
the mirror drive. Fsck can then modify the block and write it back, causing
two more writes; for a total of 3 writes for a read (worst case).
It does mean that when fsck finishes, MOST of the re-sync will be finished.
All of the metadata will be synced, and only file data blocks will remain.
