I fixed it some minute ago (sorry I overlooked a copy-user call while
fixing assorted races in /proc/):

Yes, have a look at Documentation/Changes
Note also that 2.3.22 has a deadlock condition the TCP/IP code (precisely
in /proc/net/tcp) that may lead to process not killable too (I triggered
it the first time while running pppstats -w 1).
I fixed such network deadlock too some week ago; this is my fix that will
go fine on the top of 2.3.22:
