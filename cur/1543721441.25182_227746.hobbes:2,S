Hi there, 
I've a 2.6.7 kernel, and I cannot use VLAN (MTU problem)
HW : ASUS A7N266VM-AA, onboard lan
When I do a ping (from another host to my box) -s 1468, it's working,
but not at 1470.
So, I've commented out #if 1 for debug, and there is no logging output
(rx_process) for thoses big packets (and, of course, tcpdump cannot see
it). Dropped by the nic ?
Could you help me ?
Thanks
Best regards
	--Alexandre
