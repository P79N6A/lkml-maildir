This patch independently causes the same failure: the Vaio doesn't power
off after suspend-to-disk and after a manual power cycle and resume,
networking is dead.
The message `acpi_power_off called' never comes out, so something probably
got stuck.
Or maybe something failed somewhere and the error code which would have
helped us solve this bug was simply ignored.
Note that pci_block_user_cfg_access() calls pci_save_state(), which can
fail.  But pci_block_user_cfg_access() discards that information and
returns void.  If this happens, userspace config space reads will return...
what?
