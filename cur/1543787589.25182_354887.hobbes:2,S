Regardless of any other explanations, it turns out that "p->state" can be 
something like "TASK_RUNNING | TASK_NONINTERACTIVE", and then this would 
trigger totally incorrectly.

No, I think it's correct. If you have a traced child, you can't just wait 
for it. You need to use ptrace to release it first.

If it's TASK_TRACED, and it's our child, then it shouldn't be changing. 
Besides, even if it does, we had a perfectly fine race, and we'll have 
been woken up again and we'll just go through the do_wait() loop once 
more.
So I think the code is mostly correct. But that ">" is definitely 
incorrect.
Maybe it should just be
	if (!exit_code || (p->state & TASK_TRACED))
instead?
Roland?
