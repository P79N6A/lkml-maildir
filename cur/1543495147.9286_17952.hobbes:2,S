[ please CC me directly; I'm not subscribed to this mailing list ]
`autofs' wasnt' working right.  I typed `ls /amnt/jh/', testing, and
that command hung forever, with D in the ps output.  I took both my
machines down to runlevel 1, then back up to the normal runlevel,
hoping that would fix it.  The laptop was probably fine, but I rl
cycled both of them just for overkill.
`autofs' wouldn't start back up then on my server, the machine where
that `ls' had hung, it said that the mountpoint was busy; already in
use by a low (<1000) pid.  There where no pid's less than a lot more
than that after the runlevel change.
So Linux thought that the mount was still there, an automount, even
though the pid of the autofs deamon was no longer in the ps table...?
You tell me and we'll both know.  I've not delved into the kernel much
yet.
I rebooted the server, after starting this bug report.  During this
reboot it said something about a timeout waiting for dma on /dev/hdd;
a partiton on that is one I couldn't umount where the umount hung with
D int the ps output... (more on that in a sec) I've appended the
`dmesg' output.
Everything seems to work fine again now after a reboot without
starting coda... I wonder if it's a factor because...
I'd installed the debian coda-server and coda-client packages, (don't
recall where I got them) and had tried later, after shutting them off
(since they don't work right due to a segfault in one of the tools
used during setup), to umount the partition on /dev/hdd I'd mounted on
/vicepa.  The umount command hung with D in the ps output.  Hmmm.
While I was looking at the `ps' output, I saw a [mount] command with a
low pid, as well as the `ls' command I'd run earlier.  It had hung my
terminal, and I'd clicked the X button on it.  Still a big D.  At that
point I rebooted.
I'll make copies of all the logs on the server; let me know what yous
need grepped from them.
I need to get my math done.
