it touches the waitqueue spinlock - and the __down() path [ie. the process
that gets woken up, which has the semaphore on the stack] takes the
spinlock after waking up. Ie. there's guaranteed synchronization, the
semaphore will not be 'unused' before the __down() path takes the spinlock
- ie. after the __up() path releases the spinlock. What am i missing?
