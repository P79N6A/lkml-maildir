So, this was a known issue and it's hard to fix?  I didn't know that.
I know it's a "nicer" idea to use some partition for the swap
instead of a file on reiserfs, but I created too small swap partitions
originally and I can't(/bother?) resize the other partitions.
And sometimes some memhog forces me to add even more swap.
BTW. your MUA does not generate References: header field,
it makes scoring hard...  With References I would easily
notice when someone writes a followup to some of the threads I have
participated in.  But I could patch my MUA... 8)
