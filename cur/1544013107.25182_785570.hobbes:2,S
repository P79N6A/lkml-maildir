Well I dont like local_t as you may have noticed. It limits us to an int.
I think its better to start out with the idea of the cmpxchg that applies
to any scalar. Focus on the operations instead of the use of types.

Ok so a special allocator for big percpu that avoids the need to
dynamically resize percpu sections. But this still leaves the problem that
too many small allocations may overflow the percpu area.

This is only the requirement if the page allocator and slab allocator is
converted to use the percpu area. Additional users may require more space.

Doesnt that move limit how the percpu area can be handled by the arch? If
it becomes a requirement that a percpu address is like any other global
variable then the zero based approach no longer works and with that we may
create x86_64 issues for pda conversion.
