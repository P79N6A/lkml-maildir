Or get a hybird vehicle. IMHO its seriously worth it. Doing 50mpg+ would be 
cheap even if gas is $5 per gallon (predicted price for 2006). Better than 
the 3mpg SUV mechanical whales everyone drives around. Costs like $90 to fill 
the tank, and you have to fill the tank just going up the road to get a loaf 
of bread.
