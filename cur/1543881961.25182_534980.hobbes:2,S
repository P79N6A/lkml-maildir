Sure. Like just about any PCI device that doesn't do things on its own.
A "freeze" does nothing at all, or perhaps shuts down the reader side 
(for something like a network controller).
A "suspend" does "write D3 to the suspend register". Absolutely zero in 
common.

AND THAT IS STUPID. It mixes up "suspend()" and creating a snapshot in 
ways that are totally idiotic. There is nothing in common!
