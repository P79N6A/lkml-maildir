Hm, no, no convention right now, sorry.

No.  Binary sysfs files are for "pass-through" mode only.  You are ONLY
allowed to use them if you want to read from, or write to, some bit of
hardware and not manipulate the data at all.  Examples of this is the
raw PCI config space, firmware binary blobs and BIOS upgrades.
You should NEVER pass a raw structure through sysfs by using a binary
file.  If anyone sees anywhere in the current kernel that does this,
please let me know and I'll go hit them with a big stick...
And yes, I know the documentation on the conventions for this is
seriously lacking.  Fixing that is slowly moving up my TODO list...
Hope this helps,
