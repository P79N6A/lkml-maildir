I said no such thing!  In fact, I said exactly the opposite: Windows 
does _not_ cut the port's power.  Instead it disables the port.

Note that this is different.  The START-STOP command is used to spin-up 
or spin-down a disk.  It does not affect the state of the data link.

As far as the device is concerned, there is essentially no difference 
between 1 and 3.  When the device's upstream port is disabled, the 
device must go into suspend mode.
The best approach is to send a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command followed by 
START-STOP (if the device supports it), and then to disable or suspend 
the port.  In Linux, those two commands will be sent automatically if 
you unbind the device from usb-storage.  The suspend has to be done 
manually unless you have set up a udev rule (or something equivalent) 
to enable autosuspend for the device.  Of course, this requires 
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND.
