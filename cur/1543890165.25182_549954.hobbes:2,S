Oops,
i was wrong : I did patch my 2.6.21.1 with x86_64-mm-vmalloc-32.patch :
Fix vmalloc_32 to really allocate <4GB on 64bit platforms
Ugly ifdef, but should handle all 64bit platforms that have suitable
zones. On some like Altix it's probably impossible without IOMMU
use to get memory <4GB this way,  but they have to live with that.

And I don't remember exactly what else (in case that needed I could look
at my email archive) but the bug that was found in 2.6.21 regarding the
use of system with 4Gb is still present in 2.6.21.3 : is that something
that was forgotten to be included ?
Please CC to me all lkml answer as I am not on lkml, thank.
