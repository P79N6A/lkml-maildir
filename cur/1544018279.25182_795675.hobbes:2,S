Hi
Last December we talked about 64 queues and IXP4XX. Karl has a patch
for them, and although I think it could be better to splitt it into
two different ones ("plain 64 queue expansion" for which I proposed a
modified patch based on Karl's, and "debugging and other things"), I
prefer Karl's to none.
What do you think of this? Which should be the best way to include it
in the main stream kernel?
Thanks
Miguel Ángel
