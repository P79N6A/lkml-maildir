Yep, that makes sense. If we do this, the patch needs more audit, as the
existing code uses "unsigned long" for block numbers in many many
places.
Also I think it might make sense to define "ext3_fileblk" for logical
block type, as right now many functions called "block" in many places
for file logical block, and it takes some to determine whether it's a
file logical block or physical block.

I do have an untested patch which tries to change all fs-wide block
numbers from "unsigned long" to "sector_t" type as Laurent suggested. He
did this in his 64 bit ext3 block number support patch. I wasn't sure if
we should do this for current 32 bit ext3 or wait until other 64 bit
patches.
Yeah, with the suggestion you made above, this change should be easy to
support 64bit filesystem without go through all the code again.

Okey, I will add more comments in the function.
