I think it is not quite right. You are tracking the number of ptes
that point to mlocked pages, which can be >= the actual number of pages.
Also, page_add_anon_rmap still needs to be balanced with page_remove_rmap.
I can't think of an easy way to do this without per-page state. ie.
another page flag.
