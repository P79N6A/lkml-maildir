Hello,
I have a call beack registered on write_space in kernel, so when I do a
asynchronous sock_sendmsg in the kernel, I get notified.  However, I want to
know how much data was sent on that socket, so I can free the socket after
all data has been sent.  How do I check for this condition?
Thanks
Lee
