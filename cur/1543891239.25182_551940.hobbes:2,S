flush_workqueue() blocks until any scheduled work on any CPU has run to
completion. If we have some work_struct pending on CPU 2, it can be completed
only when events/2 executes it.

This patch replaces flush_scheduled_work() with cancel_work_sync(). The latter
can still hang if the floppy interrupt happens on CPU 2 and does schedule_bh(),
events/2 starts running floppy_work->func() and preempted by RT-thread. This is
very unlikely, but possible.
From your original post:

if the floppy interrupt can't happen on CPU 2, the above scenario is not possible.

Well, I don't know what is xosview, sorry :) so I don't understand what does
"spare time" precisely mean. If this thread does some i/o or something which
can sleep, then...
OK. In that case we may have another reason for deadlock, say a pending
floppy_work needs open_lock or test_and_set_bit(0, &fdc_busy).
Could you apply the trivial patch below, and change the i/o thread to do
		prctl(1234);				// hangs ???
		printf(something);
		ioctl(Q->DevSpec1, FDSETPRM, &medprm);	// this hangs
to see if prctl() hangs or not? This way we can narrow the problem.
(of course, you can just kill the above ioctl() if this is possible).
Thanks!
Oleg.
