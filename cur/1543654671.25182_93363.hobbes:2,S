.data is significant, that is e.g. something that cannot be shared
between processes.
The fastest model on x86-64 would IMHO be a 32-bit model using all
registers, rip relative addressing and register passing conventions
(ie. a 3rd ABI).

Surely it does, for startup time (unless prelinking) the 3 times bigger .rel*
sections mean significantly more data needs to be loaded into RAM and
caches, for short-lived processes it matters a lot.
