Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.5-dj2, modify arch/i386/Config.help for highpte options.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch modifies the help text for the CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM option in
arch/i386/Config.help to explain the two new options; 
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G_HIGHPTE and CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G_HIGHPTE.
Since this is a choice selection, the help text for the first option,
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM is the only one which is visible using the current
configurators.
Here is a snippet from arch/i386/config.in both 2.5.5-dj2 and 2.5.6-pre1:
choice 'High Memory Support' \
        "off           CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM \
         4GB           CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G \
         4GB-highpte   CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G_HIGHPTE \
         64GB          CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G \
         64GB-highpte  CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G_HIGHPTE" off
If the notes for the highpte options are incorrect, feel free to provide 
a better explanation.
Steven
