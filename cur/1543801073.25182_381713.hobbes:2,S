I'm not sure it's e1000, is there any chance you can try a different
network adapter (like not e1000 based)?  with the ethtool diags error
there is something corrupting memory in your system or on your pci bus
(most likely)
My best recommendation is to check to make sure there aren't any bios
updates for your system, make sure you aren't running overclocked on
the pci bus, try different slots, try a different network adapter. 
Maybe you can try memtest86 overnight?
Honestly right now it doesn't sound like a network problem, but a
system problem.
