Yeah, I know, and it will probably work when you don't enable
data-journalling. Coda's kernelmodule currently uses generic_file_read
and generic_file_write on it's containerfiles, which works for many
filesystems. However, ext3fs (and tmpfs and several others) have a
filesystem specific write implementation and don't really like being
called with the generic functions.
The patch is simple, but I haven't made it yet. Basically we need to
wrap the read/write calls and call cii->c_cfile->f_op->file_write or
something.

ext2 uses the generic file read/write functions, so whenever ext2 is the
underlying filesystem it all works fine.
