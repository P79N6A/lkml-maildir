Nothing but further bloat in swsusp :> With a swapfile, we need to know
the location of the file (and be able to find it again when it changes,
and know how to find the next block in the file system - it might be
fragmented). The simplest solution is to keep using the current method
and create a separate swap partition if you really feel you need to,
only turning it on before swap and turning if off afterwards. As Pavel
said, code could be added to get swsusp to do it itself.

Nigel
