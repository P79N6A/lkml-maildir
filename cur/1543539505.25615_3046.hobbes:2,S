It is wanted and I'll definitely use it.  Security is NEVER a 100%
guarantee, it's a leveraged risk.  Everything that gives me more of the
advantage than the script kiddie, then by golly I'll have it.

Then try again.  When the patch is sane, doesn't have adverse side affects,
gives benefits to the masses, etc, etc, then I'm sure it'll go in.  Getting
a patch in is a sales pitch.  Convince me why I need it and I'll put it in
my kernel.  Convince Linus why everyone needs it and he'll put it in.
Speaking of the 100% factor, I'm sure with some ingenious thought, we can
figure out a way to block this pretty darn close to 100%, raw bit banging or
ioctl.
