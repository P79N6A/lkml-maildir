I managed to use a a lot of C++ code in a kernel modules. I used wrapper
functions to pass data between C and C++ parts. C++ code had no exceptions
and such thing, but I had to play some dirty tricks anyway because C++
code needs stuff which is provided by userpace libraries to run.
Maybe the right solution is writing a module that provides a fast data
path between the kernel and the userspace router.
