I took an alternative approach - since Integrator never had the complete
SMP support merged, I ripped it out of that platform.  Whether realview
suffers from the same thing or not I'm not sure - uniprocessor realview
is not something covered by the ARM default configuration files, and
therefore kautobuild won't check that configuration.
However, the things I find annoying about this is:
1. asm/smp.h was _never_ included in ARM UP builds prior to this change.
2. we have linux/smp.h and the general rule is that if asm/foo.h and
   linux/foo.h are present, linux/foo.h is included in preference to
   asm/foo.h
Given the amount of janitors we now have looking at the kernel code,
(2) is a big concern - it could mean a constant stream of patches
trying to "fix" files including asm/smp.h.
I would suggest that if there is a desire to include asm/smp.h on UP
builds, the inclusion of it by linux/smp.h is made unconditional.
