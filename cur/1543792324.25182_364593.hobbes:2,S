This is unlikely to be a Linux kernel internal development
issue, which is what this "linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org"
list is focused on.  If I knew a good list to recommend
you ask this question on off the top of my head, I'd
recommend it.  Nothing jumps to mind.  Thought I'd at
least let you know that you might not get much help here,
and encourage you to research other possible resources.
