NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
1) This message is a debug message! You forgot to set the printk level.
2) The message text is bad, the average log reader only knows swap files
   and pages in swapfiles. The first reaction will be like "WTF happened
   to my swap???". Thousands of admins will cry out in anguish trying to
   get the meaning of this message, and again cry out in wrath after they
   found out.
3) What should I do if I see this message? It's neither good, nor bad for
   me, nor is it in any way informative even if it were changed to be
   meaningfull. It's utterly useless! Let it be!
