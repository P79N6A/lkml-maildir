Thanks Walter (I cc'd Alan as RH should (and probably do already) know
this too).
Yes, I did find yesterday that it is SEP, i.e. not strictly a kernel issue
because what arrives in the PARAM block is already chopped. So,
the patch used by SuSE you mention is probably used by Red Hat as well
and causes the problem.
I have not looked at LILO sources yet (plain or patched) to confirm that
plain compiled LILO works fine with respect to >79 command lines.
Regards,
