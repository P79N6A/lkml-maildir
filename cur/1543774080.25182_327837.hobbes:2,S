OK, I looked and I have a few suggestions or comments.
1.  ort.sh needs to be run as root so that lspci -vvv and lsusb -v
work as expected.  Maybe include that requirement in 'help'?
Aha, that's what root@ng02 is supposed to mean, right?
I think it should be more explicit than that.
2.  Item 2 (full description) should allow for more than one line
of input.
3.  Item 3 (keywords) probably should allow for more than one line
of input.
4.  Item 4 (kernel version) and all of 7 (Environment) assume that
the oops happened on the system where the oops report is being
produced.  That's probably correct lots of the time, but not always.
But I don't know what to do about it.
5.  Item 7 (small sample program to duplicate problem):  at least put
an empty reminder at this spot, this is a Very Important Program.
6.  Use $EDITOR instead of vim if it is defined (set).
7.  Consider ending with on-screen message to email 'ort_oops.txt'
to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org or some other appropriate Linux
mailing list.
I did use ort.sh and it produced a pretty good output file.
Thanks,
