It was in a recent Usenix ;Login: edition, and it also appears on their
web site.  See:
	
http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/standards/22.posix.html
posix_fadvise() takes the options:
	{POSIX_FADV_NORMAL}	No further special treatment 
	{POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL}	Expect sequential references 
	{POSIX_FADV_RANDOM}	Expect random references 
	{POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED}	Will need the specified range soon 
	{POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED}	Don't need the specified range anymore 
	{POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE}	Expect data will not be reused once accessed 
and can operate on any range of any fd.  The WILLNEED/DONTNEED gives
cache control (prefetch and discard) over specific address ranges, and
the others give hints about the access pattern over the entire file.
It looks like a sensible place to start.
