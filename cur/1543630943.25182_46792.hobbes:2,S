There is an inode leak in lockd in 2.2.19, caused by a reference 
counting problem as mentioned in 
http://lists.insecure.org/linux-kernel/2000/Sep/0129.html
i have this on 2.2.19 SMP kernel
kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached in syslog
i searched web and mailing lists if this issue was fixed in 2.4 but i 
did not found any reasonable mention about it.
can someone provide me more information about this?
many thanks
rasto
