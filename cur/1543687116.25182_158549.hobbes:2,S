Hmmm... looks like 130k is too big for lk so I'll resend all split up.

Ok. I think I did it.
I used grep+sed at first and then went through the resulting patches,
fixing any problems by hand until I could spot no more. It was a lot
of fun weeding out the mistakenly changed bit-definitions but I think
I got them all. I also compiled the kernel with make allyesconfig, 
checking into compile failure for anything I broke. Obviously though,
the more people that check this the better.
Also, while I finally decided on a single patch, I can split if
need be. It's 100k and not that hard to go through, esp with syntax
highlighting (I should know... I went through it several times :)
Anyhow... here goes...
