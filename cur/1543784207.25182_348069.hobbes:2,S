Yes, you are right. I am working on rewriting the driver a bit to use a
platform device for the APCI driver, I'll take your bug report into
account as well.
On a related note: can I use the "serial8250" platform driver also for
non-ISA devices (like my APCI platform device)? The comments in
drivers/serial/8250.c suggest it's for ISA devices only, but I don't see
a particular reason for not using it for my APCI devices.
Kind regards,
Kars.
