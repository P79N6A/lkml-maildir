No, I don't think thats necessecary.  Once the apics are enabled, interrupts
shouldn't travel accross the hypertransport bus anyway, opting instead to use
the dedicated apic bus (at least thats my understanding).  The only systems what
you are suggesting would help with are systems that have no apic at all, which I
can only imagine on 64 bit systems is rare, to say the least.  The affected
domain is further reduced by the fact that this quirk is only currently being
applied to systems with nvidia PCI bridges, since those are the only systems
that this problem has manifested on.  That seems like a rather small subset, if
it exists at all.  I suppose we could only optionally enable the quirk if we
are booting a kdump kernel (implying that we would need to do something like
detect the reset_devices command line option), but I think given the limited
affect this patch, its not really needed.
