  I would think far mnore than marginally useful... this would provide
an improved possibility of avoiding fsck, something many people would find
desirable. And along that line I'll offer one more idea, not to increment
the mount count if a f/s is mounted and no writes are done to the f/s,
such as ro mount, noatime mount and no writes, etc. The check for fsck
after N mounts was designed to assist with reliability, not be a penalty
in boot time.
