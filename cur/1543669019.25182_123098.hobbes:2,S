Subject: ptrace fix changes output of ps ax

Hello, 
After 2.4.21-pre6, I found "ps ax" displays some processes
as the process names which are embraced with square brackets
like these.
1115 ?        S      0:00 [httpd]
1478 ?        S      0:00 [atd]
It is because proc_pid_cmdline() calls access_process_vm() and it fails.
The patch below fixes the problem. With this patch, access_process_vm()
do not reject requests if the access is read only.
I'm not certain this is right fix, but at least I confirmed
isec-ptrace-kmot-exploit cannot get root privilege with this patch.
Please comment.
