I think Roland's --build-id doesn't create very big section, the likely
culprit would be a hacked up ld that e.g. defaults to --hash-style=both.
Can you retry with --hash-style=sysv?  vdso really has to include the
traditional .hash section, otherwise it wouldn't be compatible with
old glibcs, and an additional .gnu.hash might be an overkill for it
- doesn't the vdso define only very few symbols?
