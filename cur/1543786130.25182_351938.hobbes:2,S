Nope. 2.6.13 is now closed to new features as is 2.6.14 (unless it is 
a really sper special case that Linus feels is important enough to slip 
in).  At this point the best thing to do is to post your patches for review,
make the changes that are asked, and be ready to post a patch vs 2.6.14
within the first week after it is released so that it might be be picked
up for 2.6.15.
