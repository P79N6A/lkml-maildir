Yes, this is a problem. Please see the new version below. Instead of delaying
pid releasing, free_pidmap() just invalidates pid_ref. The code becomes even
simpler.

The size of ref_array[] could be arbitrary low (we can't use pid_hashfn() in
this case, of course). And tref adds 4 * sizeof(void*) to every task, and it
is much more complicated.

Ok. I missed the virtualization/pspace discussion completely, so you are
very probably right.
