There are some nice pointers to information in the
Documentation/kernel-docs.txt file, which is included
in the kernel source.
If you're looking for more specific information (I take
it you've already read all documentation), then you'd
best subscribe to the linux-fsdevel list and ask there.
regards,
Rik
