Yep, it was really easy.  Following Linus' design[0]
it was a really easy hack[1].
I'd like these things to be really easily shareable,
and that's harder to do when you need to communicate
a mapped area and a file descriptor.
But without an obvious handle, it's hard to collect
unreferenced locks.
Rusty's idea is nice (though I think it'd be better
with a filesystem than a device, so you can share
names rather than file descriptors) but the page per
lock seems like rather too much overhead.
Matthew.
