Ahh, you don't believe in the development model that has produced Linux! 
Personally I do believe in it, so much so that I question the value of
signatures at the changeset level.  To me it doesn't matter where the code
came from just so long as it works.   Signatures are just a way to
increase the comfort level that the code has passed through a number of
people who have shown themselves to be relatively good auditors.  That's
why I trust the code from my distribution of choice.  Everything is out in
the open anyway so it's much harder for a con man to do his thing.
