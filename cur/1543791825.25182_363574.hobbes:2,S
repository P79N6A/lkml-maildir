it ought to be possible to get pretty much the same API as hugetlbfs via 
the 'hugetlb zone' approach too. It doesnt really change the API and FS 
side, it only impacts the allocator internally. So if you can utilize 
hugetlbfs, you should be able to utilize a 'special zone' approach 
pretty much the same way.
