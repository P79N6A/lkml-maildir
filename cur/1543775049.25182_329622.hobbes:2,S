I took a quick look and for OSS devices linphone seems to just loop over
/dev/dsp* so if the names were moved, I doubt it would work. 
But it also seems to have ALSA support and in that case it uses 
snd_card_get_name in a for loop to build a list of available cards, since 
all ALSA functions use card index numbers they should work fine independent 
of device file names.
