I have stated it several times, but here a sum up:
- XFree86 4.3 (debian/sid) 
	no work
- X.Org 6.8.1.99 (debian -dri-trunk stuff plus kernel modules9
	no work
	with 2.6.11-rc4 and 2.6.11-rc3-mm2
	this server crashes when switching to the console or shutting
	down (crashing is sometimes, not always), very nice screen which
	slowly turns white
Best wishes
Norbert
