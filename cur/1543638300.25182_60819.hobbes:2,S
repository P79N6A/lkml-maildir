read(2) is permitted to return -EINTR. Granted, we shouldn't allow it to be
interrupted and return a partial read after the point we start to
copy_to_user(), but before then it's fair game.
Regular file I/O through the page cache is inherently restartable, anyway, 
as long as you're careful about fpos.
There are better examples where you really can't have a cleanup path without
severe pain, even using ERESTARTNOINTR, and I was only joking about removing
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE _entirely_ -- but the point remains that reducing its
usage would be nice.
