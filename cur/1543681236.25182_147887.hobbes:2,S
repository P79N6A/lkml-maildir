That ends the push of -ac contributions that want adding now. There is a
chunk of quota stuff that vanished with hch's merge that looks important
as it avoids deadlocks in ext3. Perhaps Christoph can take a glance at
the ext3/super differences and the related code ?
I've resynched -ac to the quota code in pre5 and added the automatic
quota loader on top again.
