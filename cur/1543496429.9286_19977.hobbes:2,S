[1.] Process killing, kflushd problems ?
[2.] I get plenty of process killed by the kernel while I "make", "tar
xvfz" or other things CPU eaters, I get sig11 or sig4 for example, but I
also get many Segmentation Fault and also many core dumps.
I also have a problem with kflushd. Sometimes it gets totaly crazy and
uses about 96% (used top) of CPU when I mv or cp a file between
partitions. So that it takes about 1min to mv a 1Mo file ! So I have to
reboot each time he acts like that because it never stops. This is very
unconvenient.
Tonight I lost 2 CDR (this is why I'm a little angry...)because of
buffer underuns. I never had problem like that on my linuxbox, and I
wasn't running big cpu eaters processes nor using the partition the files
were on, I was just connected on the net and I used bitchx only. So my
buffer was at 6% full (!!) whereas it was always full (98%) every time I
burned a CD before. I had a 2.0.36 kernel before, and I had a 6days
uptime withtout any of those problems, and I hadn't got so much process
killed.
