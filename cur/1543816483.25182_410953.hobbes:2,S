Hasn't been for quite some time.  CPU schedulers are stuck at boot time, even
if you have the 'plugsched' patch (and if you don't, you're stuck with the one
scheduler in-tree currently).  There was a patch posted a few days ago
that allowed on-the-fly changing of plugsched, but that's still too bleeding
edge even for me... ;)

From my /etc/rc.local:
echo cfq > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler
echo noop > /sys/block/hdb/queue/scheduler
(hda is a real disk with ext3 partitions on it, hdb is a DVD/CD/RW that almost
always has exactly one process reading or writing to it at a given time, so doing
things in the order requested is just fine).
Simple enough? ;)
(This *does* require that you built more than one scheduler, and possibly
to make sure they're loaded if you managed to build them modular...)
