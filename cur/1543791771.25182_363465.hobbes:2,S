Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: mem_init crash for sparsemem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have a Cell blade with some broken memory in the middle of the
physical address space and this is correctly detected by the
firmware, but not relocated. When I enable CONFIG_SPARSEMEM,
the memsections for the nonexistant address space do not
get struct page entries allocated, as expected.
However, mem_init for the non-NUMA configuration tries to
access these pages without first looking if they are there.
I'm currently using the hack below to work around that, but
I have the feeling that there should be a cleaner solution
for this.
Please comment.
