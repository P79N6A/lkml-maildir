Is that by any chance the USR Courier I-Modem you're referring to? If
so, no driver is required - it just appears as a standard serial port,
and you treat it as such. 
I configured one of those beasts for a school last summer, and it's
the easiest task I've ever had. Went as follows:
 1. Set jumpers on ISDN card for COM3, IRQ9.
 2. Plug ISDN card into expansion slot on motherboard.
 3. Insert the following command at the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.local
	setserial /dev/ttyS2 irq 9
 4. Configure PPP to use it. THIS was the hardest part...
Best wishes from Riley.
