Yes, and as an additional clue, 2.6.20.4-rc1 does this, the later 2.6.20.4 
does not, so we have narrowed it down to one or more of the 31 patches in 
that gap.

Yes, that's why I'm fussing now, hopefully before this gets into the field 
as a final version.

Tar is used with the output sent to /dev/null, to obtain those numbers 
since the last $level figures and these are then assigned to $level + 1.  
Each disklist entry gets scanned twice during the estimate phase, once 
for a level 0 reference, and once for a "since $timestamp" value.  I'm 
not sure if the timestamp in the /etc/amandates file is used, or the 
timestamp on the indice file amandates names is used. Amanda then decides 
what to do next in an attempt to balance the tape usage run to run, and 
not let a needed level 0 ever get more than 1 run behind if amanda can 
help it.  It will drop incrementals to meet that goal if it has to with 
the current order I have setup in my amanda.conf.

And I miss-quoted the above, its the 31 patches between 2.6.20.3 and 
2.6.20.4-rc1.  Then for some reason I don't grok, 2.6.20.4 is good again.

I wasn't aware of a 'timestamp' problem on the FS level ever being 
discussed at any length here on lkml.  As far as my checking, I'm limited 
to what "ls -lc?" tells me, and those figures seem to be sane.
Is there additional data present now that could screw up tar, and do it 
without being obvious to ls?  I don't know. :-\
