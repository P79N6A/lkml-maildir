  ACPI driver only has name with no _HID _CID contest.  The handle reads
the name space to fill in the device.    There is no way to explicitly
order the list correctly for all cases as we are trying to reorder the
driver list.
  
  I looked into making the memory device dynamically change itself to
not contain a _CID (thus changing the namespace) but it got pretty ugly.
This is perhaps doable but a little on the ugly side.  
  So I just flip the order of the device list for all cases in a simple
patch.  This is a total hack and workaround for just my current
situation.

Uhh this looks to require a whole new black list infrastructure?
Any more ideas????
