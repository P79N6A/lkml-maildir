	This was a totally different question. This was about the implementation,
not the interpretation. You'll note that I objected to the implementation.

	Again, I don't see that I commented on the interpretation. This was an
unfortunate missed oppurtunity. Kaz is incorrect here.

	Obviously not, since they are incorrect and nobody did.

	Again, this had nothing whatsoever to do with whether the interpretation is
correct or not.

	The problem is that this interpretation is simply incorrect and results in
maximally inefficient implementations.
	David Butenhof recently posted to comp.programming.threads and indicated
that disagreed with this implementation. That's about as close to
authoritative as you're likely to get.
	POSIX had no intention to constrain the scheduler to compel inefficient
behavior. In fact, they went out of their way to create the lightest
possible primitives.
