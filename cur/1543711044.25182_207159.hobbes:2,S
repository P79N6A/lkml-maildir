Ah, I had seen that, but it doesn't seem to be very appropriate for an
LCD controller in an embedded environment. TFT and STN (STN in
particular) displays don't often fit into any of the standard mode
definitions. There's also several settings which aren't in the DB, such
as pixel clock polarity, dual vs. single panel STN etc.
I quite often get asked to make some arbitrary panel which a customer
picked up somewhere dirt cheap to work, it is very useful to be able to
give each of the parameters explicitly, even if they do not correspond
to a mode listed in the DB. 
I could make the code use the same XRESxYRES-DEPTH syntax though since
the 2.4 version did (by copying the parsing code from fb_find_mode()), I
just changed it to match i810fb for the 2.6 port.
I had considered extending the modedb stuff to support the requirements
of embedded LCD controller drivers and to encompass a db of LCD panels
by part number (Kconfig selectable, something like the NLS support
perhaps) containing the extra options that you can have -- but I wasn't
sure if it was something that would be useful only to me or to all
embedded LCD driver authors.
Ian.
