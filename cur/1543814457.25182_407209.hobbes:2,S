There's no need to do a get_page after the allocation and a put_page
before the free (though you could, it's just extra unnecessary work):
the allocation comes with a reference count of 1, the free frees up
that last remaining reference count of 1 (as Andrew explained more
lucidly elsewhere in his mail).
