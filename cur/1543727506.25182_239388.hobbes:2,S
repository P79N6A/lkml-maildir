I'm overall _NOT_ happy with the growing number of people trying to
"fix" PCMCIA to do what they want it to do.
I've recently had davem screaming and shouting his head off at me
while I was at OLS claiming that PCMCIA network drivers _MUST_ be
user unloadable at any time, irrespective of the requirements of
the PCMCIA layer.
It's _VERY_ easy to fuck up the PCMCIA code - we've fucked it up
several times already and the only way to detect these fuckups is
to change things _SLOWLY_ and let a full release cycle pass by
between changes.  Yes, it means that PCMCIA changes take _MONTHS_
but that's reality.
So please slow down.
