Yes, a driver shouldn't mess with that lock anyway.  I was pointing out
that there is already a lock to prevent reading and writing config
errors from happening.

Ick.  It sounds like "clean state" isn't always true if userspace can
mess the device up by simply reading its config space :)
Worse case thing, stop the whole machine while doing BIST if you want to
prevent this from happening (not that I'm actually suggesting you do it,
but if you really think it's the only way...)
Is there any way you can not run BIST all the time, except when
explicitly asked for from the user?
