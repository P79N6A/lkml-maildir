Hey Guys,
Recently, I need work on my TTY (console) driver so that it could 
support kdb. I didn't have much experiences on linux kdb. So my 
questions are:
1) 2.6 Linux for PowerPC could support kdb? where can I find the source 
code?
2) If 2.6 Linux for PowerPC doesn't support kdb, where could I get the 
package and integrated it to kernel?
Thanks in advance,
Gavin
