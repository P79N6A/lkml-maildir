Hello!
I met the strange problems (SUBJ).
I've found out that mplayerxp causes segfault when I trying
to use vesa outputs. Well, I've really spend a lot of my time
to investigate this problem and found out that this strange
combination is unworking.
Really, when I stay on ext2fs - everything works fine!
when I trying to compile my test code without threads on ext3fs -
everything works fine!
When I use mplayerxp with -vo dga (means: ext3fs+/dev/mem+pthread)
everything works fine!
Thus, if I'm excluding any component from SUBJ then everything works fine!
But not the SUBJ!
I've tried to concentrate this problem within of small project (attached)!
Any ideas please!!!
Btw, does there exists any way to convert ext3fs to ext2fs safely?
WBR! Nick
