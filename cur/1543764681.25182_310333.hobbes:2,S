Sparc64 has a deadlock because we hold mm->page_table_lock during
switch_mm().  I bet IA64 did something similar, as I remember it
had a very similar locking issue in this area.
So the deadlock was, we held the runqueue locks over switch_mm(),
switch_mm() spins on mm->page_table_lock, the cpu which does have
mm->page_table_lock tries to do a wakeup on the first cpu's runqueue.
Classic AB-BA deadlock.
