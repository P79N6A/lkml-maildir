AFAIK, root-on-LVM on the whole disk (BTW, I use such setup myself) requires 
LILO, doesn't it? Could you please list a few distributions with an easy 
method to install LILO (and, of course, root and /boot on LVM on whole disk) 
from their default installation media? So far, I only know that Debian can 
do it if you run debootstrap by hand, although they say that such setup is a 
bug (

).
