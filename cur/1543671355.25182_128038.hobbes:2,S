% man statfs

       Solaris and POSIX 1003.1-2001 have a system  call  statvfs
       that returns a struct statvfs (defined in <sys/statvfs.h>)
       containing an unsigned long f_fsid.  Linux,  SunOS,  HPUX,
       4.4BSD  have  a  system  call statfs that returns a struct
       statfs  (defined  in  <sys/vfs.h>)  containing  a   fsid_t
       f_fsid, where fsid_t is defined as struct { int val[2]; }.
       The same holds  for  FreeBSD,  except  that  it  uses  the
       include file <sys/mount.h>.
