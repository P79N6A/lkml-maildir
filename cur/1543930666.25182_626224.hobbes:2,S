It did not applied cleanly on a 2.6.22.14... copy/paste might be the issue here... Anyhow, I corrected the patch failure to apply and here is my version of it... Hoping I got this (attached patch).
Compiling at the moment... will try this out with commvault 5.9 probably in the morning and get back with the results.
Let me know I got the patch wrong.
