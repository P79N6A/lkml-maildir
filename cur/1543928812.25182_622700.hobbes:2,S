Due to my faux pas of top posting (see

By testing the situation I can confirm that the one line patch above
fixes the problem.
I will continue testing some other cases to see if it cause any other
issues but I don't expect it to.
I will post this change for 2.6.24 and list Feng as author. If that's
ok with Feng.
As for the original patch I will resubmit it for 2.6.25 as a general
purpose improvement.
