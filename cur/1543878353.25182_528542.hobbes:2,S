Hi,
I am one of those who have been happily testing Con's patches.  
They work better than mainline here.
There seems to be a disconnect on what Con is trying to achieve with SD.
They do not improve interactivity per say.  Instead they make the scheduler 
predictable by removing the alchemy used by the interactivity estimator.   
Mikes patches may be better alchemy but they continue down the same 
path - from prior experience, we can say with fairly good confidence, that
 there will be new corner cases that trigger problems.
With SD, if you ask too much of the machine it slows down.  You can fix this,
if required, by renicing tasks some tasks - or by reducing the load on the box.
If one really needs some sort of interactivity booster (I do not with SD), why
not move it into user space?  With SD it would be simple enough to export
some info on estimated latency.  With this user space could make a good
attempt to keep latency within bounds for a set of tasks just by renicing.... 
Thanks
Ed Tomlinson
PS.  Get well soon Con.
