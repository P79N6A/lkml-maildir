Hmmm. I wonder, then, does RSDL give an advantage in the areas I mentioned 
(starvation and predictability)? 
RSDL does give equal timeslices (eg equal cpu time) to each process - it's 
just that processes which didn't use their time yet can quickly run, right? 
Now I might not understand things here, but that it sounds more fair, though 
you're more quallified to judge that. So, for me, as an user, it boils down 
to: does this solve problems, and does it introduce problems?
I must say I compare RSDL to staircase, as that's what I'm used to - a bit 
more interactive compared to mainline. RSDL does slightly worse AND slightly 
better - worse in interactivity on heavy loads (8 makes running on my 
dualcore) but it doesn't have the systemwide stalls sometimes occurring on 
both mainline and staircase - though it replaces them with shorter, 
app-specific ones (the worse interactivity I mention).
