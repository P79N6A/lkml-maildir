In fact, I'd like to remove the sys_sync() from the freezer entirely, because
it just doesn't belong in there.
The only advantege of having sys_sync() in freeze_processes() is that we
have a chance to write out everything when applications cannot produce more
data to write, but there are filesystems which don't do that anyway (eg. XFS),
so generally there's no reason to bother.
