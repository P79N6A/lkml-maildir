The former may only be used when we *know* there aren't any references
remaining to any of the dentries (as it severely reduces the amount of time
spent holding the dcache_lock).  The latter is used in situations in which the
assumptions of the former don't hold true.
Now I could make the former hold the locking a lot more (I had a version of
the patch that did that), but the former destroys all an sb's dentries,
whether or not they're still in use (which they shouldn't be), and the latter
does not.
The latter also doesn't reap the anon list directly; only where anon dentries
are also unused does any anon reaping occur.  The former reaps them directly
and forcibly.
So, in conclusion, I don't think you can replace the latter with the former,
and the latter is insufficiently complete to replace the former.

If you're just remounting, then not all dentries can necessarily be purged
anyway - some of them may still be open.  Consider remounting root for
read-only or read-write...
