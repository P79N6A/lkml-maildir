I stand corrected.

Is there a way in software to auto-sense the type of flash used ?
Maybe some BIOSes store that in their DMI area ?
(I forget whats stored there altogether).

Exactly.
I doubt the encryption algorithms are PGP strength, more likely something
slightly more advanced than a progressive XOR. :)

That's pretty cool. Looks like an interesting project.
I notice from the docs that it was written around the time of 2.1.9x,
anyone tried it on anything more recent ?
I also notice it only supports a few chipsets. Mine isn't supported,
(VIA VP3) but I may see if I can hack something out of this tonight.
Fun :)
