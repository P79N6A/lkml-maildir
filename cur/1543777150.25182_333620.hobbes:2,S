Sounds like a different issue. The patch Bron included before fixes (or at 
least reduces to the point where it fixes it for us) a problem where 
processes get stuck in D state and are unkillable. A reboot is required to 
remove them. Apparently this is a known bug in ReiserFS (see messages 
below). As noted, the same bug exists in ext3. There appears to have been 
some patches to try and fix it for both reiserfs and ext3, but I'm not sure 
if they're in the mainline kernel yet.
