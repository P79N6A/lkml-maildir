1) What hardware is your eth1 (snippage from lspci might be helpful)?
2) Any chance of upgrading to at least a relatively recent 2.2 kernel
(e.g. 2.2.25 is the latest) and seeing if the problem persists?
3) If per chance you can reproduce the problem with current 2.2, you're
going to have to tell us more info.  E.g. see: linux/REPORTING-BUGS or
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lkml/reporting-bugs.html
HTH,
Neale.
