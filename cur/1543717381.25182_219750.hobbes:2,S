Hi Andre,

One problem: You do not close the socket. The select() call itself keeps
the socket open ;-)
It was discussed a few months ago with poll(): The standard is wrong,
noone implements it as specified. Just think what should happen if the
selected fd is replaced with dup2(). HP UX kills the process if you do
that with poll - I expect that select causes the same result.
You'll have to change your user space app.
