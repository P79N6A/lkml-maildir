So, to rephrase, your stated goal is to get rid of any non-singular goto
labels in function error handling paths? Aside from sounding trippy in a
non-conformist kind of way, what benefits will this give to the kernel?
I ask this because there's already one easy-to-spot downside: you'll end
up calling kfree(NULL) a bunch of times that can be, and should be,
avoided. Whereas turning my computer into a better space-heater using
noops (like repeated kfree(NULL) calls) may be a noble goal, I'd much
rather not waste this planet's limited resources unnecessarily.

The parameters to a '+' operator need not be equivalent.

These cases should be fixed independently of any particular KFREE()
agenda.

I am curious as to how a KFREE() macro can fix cases where people don't
check the kmalloc() return value.

I glanced at one instance, and...

'acpi_perf_data' is a global and persistent data structure, where a NULL
value actually has a specific and distinct meaning (as in
acpi_cpufreq_cpu_init()). How you think this helps your argument with
setting a local pointer to NULL after free is beyond me.
