That's true. And it sounds all reasonable from your point of view, and
the firmware loader needs fixing, and the silly blocking request needs
to be removed from the kernel, that's known for a very long time now,
but nobody did the work so far.
But in this specific case, it is more the combination of your options,
what causes this problem to appear. You don't have an initramfs, you
don't use modules, but you are linking a driver into the kernel image
which depends on a conceptually broken blocking userspace transaction to
initialize.
This combination of options just doesn't make sense. Either use
initramfs, or use a kernel module for the driver that needs userspace to
initialize, or patch the driver not to block in the request, or patch
the driver to optionally include the firmware in the driver.
You just picked a set of options that doesn't work nicely together. No
distro setup has this problem, that's probably why nobody really cared
and it didn't get fixed so far.
