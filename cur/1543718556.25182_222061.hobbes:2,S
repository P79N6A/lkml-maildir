yes, you are right, this is an external driver.
I have written to linux kernel, because I had massive problems with this
modem with many kernel versions, including 2.4. for example, load of
sound modules was  freezing network connection. 2.6.6 changed this to
more stable situation and now the only problem is what I have described.
that's why I think it's rather kernel problem.
this is nforce2 based system.
