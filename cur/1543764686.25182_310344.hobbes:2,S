Ok, so the above is interesting, something is callign setcmap way too
much here I would say... Besides, it looks like set_par is called twice,
which is wrong too.

Hrm... the last (serie of 64 setcolreg) are probably X beeing extremely
dumb, and calling the ioctl 64 times to set each palette entry instead
of doing a single call for the whole palette...
Anyway. Except for maybe the double set-par on switch from X to console,
there isn't much more we can do here. We might be able to improve X but
there is a significant lag between a fix done to X.org HEAD appears in
any distro. The fact is, according to ATI, there is a HW bug on M6 taht
can cause lockups of the chip, and this 5ms workaround is necessary to
avoid it... 
Ben.
