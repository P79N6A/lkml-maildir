Forgive my insistence here...I'm trying to figure out what LDD3 is going to
say on this subject.  If we get it right, hopefully that will head off a
lot of questions in the future...

Actually, as I read it, each kobject has a kobj_type pointer, and in *that*
structure is a release() method.  I had found it...:)
The struct cdev which I, as a driver author, can embed within my own
structure has a kobject in it.  If it's an embedded cdev, its ktype pointer
will be aimed at ktype_cdev_default, which sets up cdev_default_release()
as its release function.
If I understand things correctly, as long as references to the embedded
struct cdev remain, I cannot free the driver-specific structure in which
the struct cdev is embedded.  So, somehow, I need to know when that struct
cdev's release() method is called.  I could do that by changing its ktype
field to my own special type, and remembering to call cdev_purge() in my
own release function.  Somehow, however, that doesn't feel like the right
approach.  It seems to me like we need a release() method in struct cdev
that is called from the struct cdev's own release() method - at least, in
the non-dynamic case.  No?  What am I missing here?
Thanks,
