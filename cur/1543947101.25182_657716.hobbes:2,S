FWIW, my general guidelines for merging drivers in my areas are:
1) it's not fugly
2) it has an active maintainer who responds to feedback
I tend to think it is NOT in the best interests of Linux users, for us 
to merge vendor-fugly drivers with many layers of OS wrappers and 
similar obfuscation.
But similarly...  I merge drivers long before our SCSI maintainer will, 
and I value "it works" above stupid checkpatch warnings.
