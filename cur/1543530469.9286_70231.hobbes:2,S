   What should XFS or any other file system do with these? I guess they
   should return EINVAL.  What if we accidentally or purposely get called
   with this?  Applications don't normally check which file system they are
   running on.  I don't suspect that all file systems should be including
   linux/include/linux/ext2_fs.h.
Well, if you don't recognize the ioctl, you should return EINVAL.....
If XFS doesn't support any ioctl's, then it can have a very trivial
ioctl() handler, and you don't hve to worry about any device collisions.
In practice the collision hasn't been a problem, since the 32-bit space
is relatively sparsely occupied.
