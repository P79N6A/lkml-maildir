Any reason to not just use a struct device here?  This is a device,
right?  Or at the very least, a kobject would be acceptable.
Please don't roll your own reference counting code, when we've already
gotten a in-kernel version that has been debugged quite well.
Is this going to help us be able to get rid of the MOD_* calls in ATM
drivers soon?
thanks,
