Subject: [Patch:000/004] wait_table and zonelist initializing for memory hotadd

Hi.
These are parts of patches for new nodes addition v4.
I picked them up because v4 might be a bit too many patches.
These patches can be used even when a new zone becomes available.
When empty zone becomes not empty, wait_table must be initialized,
and zonelists must be updated.
So, They are a good group for once post.
  ex) x86-64 is good example of new zone addition.
      - System boot up with memory under 4G address.
        All of memory will be ZONE_DMA32.
      - Then hot-add over 4G memory. It becomes ZONE_NORMAL. But, 
        wait table of zone normal is not initialized at this time.
This patch is for 2.6.17-rc1-mm1.
Please apply.
----------------------------
Change log from v4 of hot-add.
  - update for 2.6.17-rc1-mm1.
  - change allocation for wait_table from kmalloc() to vmalloc().
    vmalloc() is enough for it.
V4 of post is here.
