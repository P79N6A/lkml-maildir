Hi Dave,
I'm coming back on this topic since I managed to get DRI to work with
the open source driver on 2.6.15 (I mean drivers/char/drm/radeon).
And it does not work on -mm (actually I only tried -mm3) since
apparently radeon loads drm, and drm needs some agp symbols. Both radeon
and drm (and agpgart) and built as module here.
How are we supposed to get DRM to work on PCI Express cards if DRM needs
AGP and agpgart does not load when no AGP card is found ? :)
drm: Unknown symbol agp_bind_memory
...
drm: Unknown symbol agp_backend_release
radeon: Unknown symbol drm_open
...
radeon: Unknown symbol drm_release
thanks,
Brice
