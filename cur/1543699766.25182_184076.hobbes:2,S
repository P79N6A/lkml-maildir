ok, we only recently started zapping SIGCHLD==ignore processes via the
detached-thread method. Your testcase shows one hole in this mechanism: if
a process that was created as a 'deatched process' itself creates a
detached thread (NPTL thread), and the thread exits before the thread
group leader, then nobody will release the leader. The patch below fixes
this bug, your testcase now works fine on my box. I've tested both UP and
SMP kernels.
the code is a bit ugly, but it's necessary - a parent can decide _after_
starting the child that it wants to detach it. (by setting SIGCHLD to
SIG_IGN. The testcase doesnt do this.) So the only place where we can
detect the detached-ness of a process is in do_notify_parent().
