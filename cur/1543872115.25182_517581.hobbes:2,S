Sort of, IMHO sysfs classes seems the logical final incarnation for user space 
access. But to get there it has to migrate down from the machine layer to 
something that declares it's mapping to the pins on a board.
However, just like gpio.txt discusses I am using them to detect MMC insertion, 
so I needed standard way to declare the pin. 
This provides that, thank you.
