once upon a time, i suggested having more than one level of module
"quality".  at the moment, some kernel code is marked as "EXPERIMENTAL",
but this is supported via a regular dependency when it doesn't really
qualify as a dependency.  dependencies are typically used to refer to
dependencies on other *code*, not some abstract level of goodness
like "EXPERIMENTAL".
perhaps it's time to add another category with values like OBSOLETE,
DEPRECATED, EXPERIMENTAL, BROKEN(?) and so on.  by default, the
quality would be regular, or something like that.
and in the end, while i know some folks don't think it's a big
deal, i think doing a "make allyesconfig" really should work.
