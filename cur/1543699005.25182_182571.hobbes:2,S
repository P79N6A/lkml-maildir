Hello,
I just experienced a problem with ns83820 and 802.1Q vlan support. It seems
that incoming packets get dropped if the device is connected to a tagged switch
port. Reducing the mtu solves the problem but is of course not nice.
I remember some old docs where it says there can be problems because of the
oversized tagged packets. Intel e100 seems to work flawlessly in same setup.
Regards,
Stephan
