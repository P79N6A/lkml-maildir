cpusets provides cpu and memory NODES binding to tasks.  And I think it
works great for NUMA machines where you have different nodes with its
own set of CPUs and memory.  The number of those nodes on a commodity HW
is still 1.  And they can have 8-16 CPUs and in access of 100G of
memory.  You may start using fake nodes (untested territory) to
translate a single node machine into N different nodes.  But am not sure
if this number of nodes can change dynamically on the running machine or
a reboot is required to change the number of nodes.
Though when you want to have in access of 100 containers then the cpuset
function starts popping up on the oprofile chart very aggressively.  And
this is the cost that shouldn't have to be paid (particularly) for a
single node machine.
And what happens when you want to have cpuset with memory that needs to
be even further fine grained than each node.
Containers also provide a mechanism to move files to containers. Any
further references to this file come from the same container rather than
the container which is bringing in a new page.
In future there will be more handlers like CPU and disk that can be
easily embeded into this container infrastructure.
