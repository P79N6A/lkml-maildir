OK, so there are actually two separate bugs, it seems: one that 
remounting a RO media in the RW mode succeeds (this "works" for any RO 
media, as far as I can tell) and the second (this one is specific to the 
floppy driver only) that a further write to such a falsely rw-remounted 
media doesn't return (in the user space) an error.
