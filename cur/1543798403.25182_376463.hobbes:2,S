I haven't seen any such comments from you, so I haven't ignored anything.
The spec I have says that this is a single block command. So such
trickery would not work. It isn't explicit about padding so it might be
possible to pad the data (since password length is specified in the
data). If not, then we either ignore this function or have a system
where we can detect limited hosts and print warnings.
