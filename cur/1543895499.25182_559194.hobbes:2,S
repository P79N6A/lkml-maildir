I realize that it is non-linear - and I didn't do anything to "speed
things up". Just build -> boot -> git bisect good/bad -> build etc.

I don't believe that either of these is the case. I have booted
about 8 different kernel revisions several times (most three times),
alternating between them (not the same three times on a row) and the
ones that boot correctly always booted correctly, while the ones that
hung, always hung (although in a totally reproducable way).
Nevertheless, it is not 100% impossible. I have the feeling that it
MIGHT be related to the fact that I have 4 CPU's - and that perhaps some
race condition is involved. And if that is the case, then there might be
some kernel version where boot/not-boot is less reliable then with the
eight I tested - apart from that three times isn't very much (but doing
it for four good kernels and two bad kernels, it still is a reasonable
indication for reproducability).

I didn't -- what is the command to generate a list like this with git?

Heh - now you are insulting me :p  I said I did, and I did.
The reason that I made that list manually is because wanted to have more
overview. I use this alias to build the kernels:
hikaru:/usr/src/kernel/git/linux-2.6>alias build
alias build='cp /boot/config-2.6.22-rc4-hikaru-amd64 .config &&
make-kpkg clean && VER=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M") && BRANCH=$(git branch |
grep "^\*" | sed -e "s/\* //") && NAMEEXT="-$BRANCH-$(git rev-list
--max-count=1 $BRANCH)-$(dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH)" &&
make-kpkg --revision=$VER --append-to-version=-$NAMEEXT --rootcmd
fakeroot clean && make-kpkg --revision=$VER --append-to-version=$NAMEEXT
--rootcmd fakeroot --initrd kernel_image modules_image'
That results in debian kernel package names like:

Heh - hopefully you have 20" monitors like met :p
However - it didn't give me an overview of the git bisect good/bad
process. Therefore I used 'gitk -all' and it's search function to
find all the kernels that I tested and put them in a file, such
creating that list I posted here. If there is a way to generate
this list with a command, please tell me :)

Some online documention said you can use git reset --hard gitId to
choose a different point nearby what git bisect 'suggests' to test next.
I didn't do that in this case however.

I suppose you mean: ... then you WILL get sensible values out of git
bisect. But, since I already did a real "git bisect" without giving it
random points, I am afraid you jumped conclusions.

No such file exists (anymore).
However, I can easily reproduce it. From my history file I can see that I started with:
   git bisect start
   git bisect bad v2.6.22-rc5
   git bisect good 99f9f3d49cbc7d944476f6fde53a77ec789ab2aa
I wrote everything down on paper (the git id's and whether they
were good or bad), so I can reproduce it with:
hikaru:/usr/src/kernel/git/linux-2.6>git bisect start
hikaru:/usr/src/kernel/git/linux-2.6>git bisect bad v2.6.22-rc5

    mm: Fix memory/cpu hotplug section mismatch and oops.
    When building with memory hotplug enabled and cpu hotplug disabled, we
    end up with the following section mismatch:
    WARNING: mm/built-in.o(.text+0x4e58): Section mismatch: reference to
    .init.text: (between 'free_area_init_node' and '__build_all_zonelists')
    This happens as a result of:
            -> free_area_init_node()
              -> free_area_init_core()
                -> zone_pcp_init() <-- all __meminit up to this point
                  -> zone_batchsize() <-- marked as __cpuinit                     fo
    This happens because CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n sets __cpuinit to __init, but
    CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y unsets __meminit.
    Changing zone_batchsize() to __devinit fixes this.
    __devinit is the only thing that is common between CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y and
    CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=y. In the long run, perhaps this should be moved to
    another section identifier completely. Without this, memory hot-add
    of offline nodes (via hotadd_new_pgdat()) will oops if CPU hotplug is
    not also enabled.
