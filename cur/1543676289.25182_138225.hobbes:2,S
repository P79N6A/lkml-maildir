[SNIPPED patch]
But you just removed the portability hooks. The current code worked
in DOS, on Windows, etc., as will as Linux. This means that if some-
body, as unlikely as it may seem, develops a better/quicker
version using M$ Visual C/C++, you can't get a patch. In particular,
FAR is your friend. A simple #define makes it disappear when you
are not using a segmented architecture, but allows the use of
large arrays when you are.
These kinds of things don't make the code 'pure'. It just prevents
future enhancements. Look in the 'C' header files and see all the
macros that disappear under the right conditions. Would you
justify getting rid of __P in those headers? If not, please don't
eliminate FAR.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
