We can.  Graham Stoney had all this going against 2.2.  See

The kernel doesn't link when you compile with -fno-inline because of all
the `extern inline' qualifiers.  These need to be converted to `static
inline'.    Jim Houston has a script which does this.  See
	
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0201.3/0888.html
It would be rather good if we could get that script run across the
tree - no-inline has its uses at times.
