Hello together
I've a problem with my system clock. It runs too fast. In realtime 5 minutes 
my notebook runs 8 minutes. The BIOS-Time doesn't run.
With kernel 2.4.24 everything is ok but when I boot my new 2.6.2 the clock 
runs.
Could it be that the compiled speedstepping caused this problem?
Or is there an another causing?
My system: IBM A31p, Kernel 2.6.2, Debian unstable
I already tried "adjtimex --adjust", but I only get the following lines:
