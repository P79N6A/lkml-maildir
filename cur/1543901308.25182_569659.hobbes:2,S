is this  a matter of running some test to find out, or is this a question 
for the kexec implemantors?

ok, this means that the resume operation is not a solved problem (at least 
for the kexec process)
now, one possible approach to this (and this may be what Ying Huang it 
thinking of) would be to have the restore process be
1. boot the normal kernel with a dummy userspace, initializeing all 
devices
2. kexec to the hibernate kernel
3. the hibernate kernel's userspace overwrites all memory from the 
origional system that was saved
4. kexec from the hibernate kernel back to the origional kernel
the ugly part here is the need for the dummy userspace in step #1 so that 
it doesn't try to access the wrong things.
now, it may be that the kernel boot in step 1 doesn't need to be able to 
initialize all drivers for things to work in step 4, in which case things 
are much simpler (but you still may need the three kernel hop so that the 
final kernel is running in the same addresses that it started in.
