First thing I thought of - Slackware is a 'clean, straight' distro though, and 
the only asound.state file I had was in /etc/ and only one alsactl in 
default /usr/sbin

Well, it appears to have fixed the issues I had.  Several reboots since and no 
problems now.
Looking back, originally I had a 2.4.x kernel - I have since upgraded to 2.6.x 
series, plus built a lot of new tools and such from source - all except alsa 
stuff, of course - so it does make sense and I kick myself for not thinking 
about this in the beginning.  One to remember.
Thanks,
Nick
