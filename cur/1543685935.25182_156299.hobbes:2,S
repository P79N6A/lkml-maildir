Where is the pool size set to 1024 bits?  I'm reading 2.5.75, and it
looks to me like the hash is over the whole pool, of 512 bits for the
primary and 128 bits for the secondary pool:
	for (i = 0, x = 0; i < r->poolinfo.poolwords; i += 16, x+=2) {
		HASH_TRANSFORM(tmp, r->pool+i);
		add_entropy_words(r, &tmp[x%HASH_BUFFER_SIZE], 1);
	}
