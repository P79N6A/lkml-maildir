Hi,
Whilst setting up a bunch of thin clients, I thought it'd be really
useful if a symlink could be pointed at, say /mnt/{ip}/hostname and
{ip} would expand to the IP address of the machine (inspired by
Tru64 unix).
It was subsequently realised that this could have other uses, so
here is a patch, against 2.4.20 (applies against 2.4.21-rc6 too)
that allows you to expand {keyword} to something customisable
through /proc. For usage details, see the comments at the top of
fs/vfs_map.c

So does anybody think this would be a useful feature to have, or
just feature bloat? If useful, I'd be happy to port it to 2.5.xx.
Ta,
Bernard.
PS. please CC me on replies.
