After upgrading from 2.4.2 to 2.4.3 with jfs 0.2.1 my machine died last 
night.
The last messages in syslog were:
Apr  3 01:35:01 hades kernel: Unable to handle kernel paging request at 
virtual
address 8d0800c0
Apr  3 01:35:01 hades kernel: *pde = 00000000
Apr  3 01:35:01 hades kernel: Unable to handle kernel paging request at 
virtual address 8d0800b8
Apr  3 01:35:01 hades kernel: *pde = 00000000
And the last application message was:
Apr  3 01:35:01 hades gnome-name-server[225]: input condition is: 0x11, 
exiting
Does anyone have a clue what this means?
Regards,
	Andreas
