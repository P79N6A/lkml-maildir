You are talking about hibernate, right?  Suspending (to ram) is
instantaneous, in that _after_ suspend no CPU is active obviously.

OK, this has _nothing_ at all to do with fuse then, and everything to
do with disk I/O.
Just because fuse is a filesystem, it doesn't have to do anything with
block devices, just like procfs doesn't either.
So removing the freezer from the hibernate path would be problematic,
but as I understand this is not what has been proposed, only removing
the freezer from the STR path, which should be OK.
