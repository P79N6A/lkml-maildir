I did that at first, but decided that what I really wanted was "safe".
"nonnull" is nice for avoiding the NULL check, but it's useless for 
anything else.
"safe" to my mind means that not only is it not NULL, it's also safe to 
dereference early (ie "prefetchable"), which has a lot of meaning for the 
back-end.

That's pretty much _exactly_ what "safe" means.
Basically, a real C compiler is not allowed to dereference a pointer
speculatively, since that could have undefined side effects in the
machine. And "safe" means that there are no side effects, pregnancy- 
or otherwise.

No. "nonnull" is useless. Even if it isn't NULL, the C standard does not 
allow the compiler to just dereference something willy-nilly.
In contrast, "safe" means that the compiler could do something like
	int * safe ptr;
	if (!a)
		a = *ptr;
and know that it is "safe" to transform this into
	tmp = *ptr;
	a = a ? : tmp;
which it otherwise can't necessarily determine.
