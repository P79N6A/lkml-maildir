There is no special consideration for user space. Since all useful memeory is 
mapped 1-1, guess user space would work as is. Unless iam missing something 
here.. so yes.. there is no protection with 1-1, but guess its like 
compatibility mode until the code gets converted over.
Keith: cced says some of the user space side also is getting converted over with
some driver support possibly. So this is an interim problem until X catches up
with it.
