in the performance/gamer end of the market, you're screwed.
ATI -    Radeon 9200 is AGPx8, supported by open driver (Based on R200 core)
         All other current cards need binary only driver.
Nvidia - Binary only for accelerated 3d.
Matrox - Not exactly a speed demon any more in the 3d market. Open
         drivers though. Not sure about Parhelia.
SiS    - Cards like the Xabre are quite cheap, though unsupported,
         though SiS folks did seemto wnat to help at one point, then
         when quiet.
S3     - Again, poorly performing, specs/drivers are out there.
who did I miss ?
