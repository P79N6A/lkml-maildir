Your driver basically boils down to a simple IDE host driver configured
by platform functions. I suggest you remove "compact flash" here and
have the platform resource optinally be either PIO or MMIO and you
magically get a "generic" IDE driver useable by a lot of simple embedded
machines (it assumes all timing related things have been handled by the
firmware). Want to be sneakier ? Add a timing setup callback to the
platform data you pass to it and you get one that can even do PIO
modes :)
