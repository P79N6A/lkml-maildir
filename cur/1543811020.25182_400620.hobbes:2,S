Hi there,
I'm looking for a file monitor for Linux, basically like filemon
(
http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Filemon.html
) for Windows.  But
it looks like filemon for Linux has been discontinued.
I looked into dnotify but it was not what I'm looking for.  I want a
monitor program that can intercept all file access of any process that
satisfy a given filter.  Is there a program?  I searched on Google but
had no luck.
Thanks,
Wei
