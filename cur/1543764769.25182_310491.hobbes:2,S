I do not know about any and I do not think it would be usefull here. How
would you convert value passed by API into register value? Driver has no
chance to know about hardware design.

I'd like to, but simply do not have enough informations to do it. In other
worlds I still do not know what is reasonable here.

That's not about taking any shortcuts, that's about finding sane API. When
time shows it wrong and it will need change people will complain about
compatibility. See my questions about API bellow [*].
Based on your and Jean's input, following so far sounds reasonable:
Create "charge" sysfs entry for ds1339 when it is detected. Do not write
any value to Trickle Charge register, until its value is written to this
entry.

Agree, but with probability near the certainty I can tell that device works
a bit differently than described in datasheet. Anyway, new 100% reliable
test is done, so it could be eventually used if ds1339 support finds its
way into driver.

Think about this register as about NVRAM address. It can have any value,
but only certain values will enable charge.
[*] Now lets forget ds1339, there are few things I'd like to know about
this driver.
How are you using this driver? There is non-static function
ds1337_do_command which expects id. How do you know which id belongs
to which chip? Do you actually have machine with more than one ds1337?
Chip has fixed address, so only one can hang on one bus (am I right?)
Also it is unlikely that machine will have more that one RTC. The only
exception which comes on mind are NUMA systems which have one RTC per
node. Anything else? Why date format returned/expected by this driver
differs from other drivers?
Thanks in advance,

PS. I'm sorry about some formulations I used in earlier mails. I was
overworked and tired and that affected my otherwise (hopefully) good
decorum :)
