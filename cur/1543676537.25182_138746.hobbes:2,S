   The basic problem is still that module_exit is a synchronous interface, 
   from where you can't call any asynchronous functions, unless you prevent 
   new callbacks via try_module_get() or you have to wait for all pending 
   events.
We don't use module refcounts at all anymore for netdev objects.
That's the whole key.
Module refcounts are spurious when a subsystem does it's own sane
accounting and uses strictly dynamically allocated objects.
