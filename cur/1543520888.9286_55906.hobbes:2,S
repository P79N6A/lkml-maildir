	No it is not. The argument used in the late seventies / early eighties was
that nobody would be using the same application code. Most of us are writing
application code now that makes no such date-related assumptions. A
recompile will fix them.
	We aren't saying that our code will not be in use after 2038. It may well
be. But it will work by then.
