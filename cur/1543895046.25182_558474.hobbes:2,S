When you get into the recycling issues with storage, the patents come 
into play. Also, using the file name to reference revisions is already 
the subject of a patent previously filed (I no longer own the patent, I 
sold them to Canopy). There is a third one about to be issued.
The patents are:
*
6,862,609
**6,795,895
and this one about to be issued:
http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/fetch.jsp?LANG=ENG&DBSELECT=PCT&SERVER_TYPE=19&SORT=1211506-KEY&TYPE_FIELD=256&IDB=0&IDOC=1205953&C=10&ELEMENT_SET=IA,WO,TTL-EN&RESULT=1&TOTAL=3&START=1&DISP=25&FORM=SEP-0/HITNUM,B-ENG,DP,MC,PA,ABSUM-ENG&SEARCH_IA=US2005045566&QUERY=
%28IN%2fmerkey%29+
The last one was filed with WIPO and has international protection, UK 
included.
