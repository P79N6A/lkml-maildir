Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

NTFS 2.1.1a is now released for kernel 2.4.20. This fixes both the
reported hangs and improves the handling of compressed files so that the
warning message people keep reporting is now gone. (Note the hangs were
specific to the 2.4.x kernel ntfs versions. 2.5.x kernel ntfs versions
are not affected.)
Download the patch from:
        
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/downloads.html
Or get from our BK repository (which is at the current BK linux-2.4
version, i.e. 2.4.21-pre4-bk):
        bk://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-2.4
Best regards,
	Anton
