Not the design center for the original "exec /sbin/hotplug" style
event delivery, no way!
A near-term option would be just to have some kind of throttle on
how many hotplug invocations are going on concurrently -- avoiding
process creation storms.  That should easily take Linux all the way
into the 2.7 series, for those who want to tread carefully in terms
of changing sysadmin technologies.
