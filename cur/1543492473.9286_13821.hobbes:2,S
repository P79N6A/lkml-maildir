Alan, may be you are right but ...
I have just bought a Toshiba laptop and it have an internal modem. It's a
winmodem so I have this piece of hardware soldered somewhere on my
laptop's motherboard and I don't use it. It's there doing absolutely
nothing. Of course I will buy a decent PCMCIA Lan+Modem card (I've heard
the xircom one is very good) but if someone will make a winmodem working
team I will be more that happy to join the team and help.
... I don't see any reason for discouraging people working on a winmodem
driver.
Ciao,
	Riccardo.
