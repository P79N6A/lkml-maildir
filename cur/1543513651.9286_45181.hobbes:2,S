As long as we're FWIW'ing, here's my mail sorting scheme.
qmail lets you make suffixed versions of your address, and easily munge your
From: to match them, like so:
echo ./Mail/kernel > ~/.qmail-kernel
kelm () {
  MAIL=$HOME/Mail/kernel QMAILINJECT=f QMAILUSER=pacman-kernel QMAILNAME='Alan Curry' elm "$@"
}
And zsh lets you make multiple versions of the "You have new mail" message,
like this:
export MAILPATH="$HOME/Mailbox:$HOME/Mail/kernel?You have kernel mail."
As for "look in many places", well, I use screen, so I'm always looking in
many places. :) One screen runs kelm, always. Once every few months, the box
is rebooted and I have to hit ^A^C and type "kelm" again.
