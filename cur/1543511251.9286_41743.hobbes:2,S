I apologize for the off-topic post, but I'm having a really hard
time finding out definitively whether the current major Linux
distributions support the SCSI chip used on the Tyan 1837
motherboard.  The chip is the AIC-7896, and I've seen numerous
references to the 7895 and the 789x series being supported, but
I've yet to find something that explicitly mentions the 7896.
Since I will be running tests with borrowed hardware which isn't
in my possession yet, I need to answer this question soon and 
unambiguously.
Also--if anyone can tell me how the chip is supported (natively, 
patch needed, whatever), that would also be appreciated.
We now return you to your regularly scheduled kernel discussion....
Lou
