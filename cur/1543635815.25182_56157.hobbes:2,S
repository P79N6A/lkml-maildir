Vanilla 2.5.25 still uses the original driver even if the new one was
enabled. It isn't removed there. If both are enabled, they won't work.
-dj trees have the old driver removed, so the new one can work. In
2.5.26 (or 
http://linux-input.bkbits.net:8080/linux-input
) the new
driver config option will disable the old one.
