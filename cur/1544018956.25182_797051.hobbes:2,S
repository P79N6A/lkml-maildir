note, we could reuse the ftrace/irqtrace callbacks as well to create an: 
"enforce IRQs off and debug violations of that" facility.
It would work like this, you could mark IRQs as disabled 'permanently':
   force_irqs_off_start();
   ...
   force_irqs_off_end();
you could mark an arbitrarily complex code sequence that way, and ftrace 
would emit a WARN_ONCE() if irqs are enable anytime during that sequence - 
by using the irq-tracking facilities we have for the irqsoff tracer (and 
which we also have for lockdep).
Would that be useful?
