Excellent.  I'll post it on upstream.

Do you mean a patch to gcc?  Apparently gcc 4.3 should be fine, but I haven't
been able to build a toolchain that includes it.  I'm currently stuck on
trying to get through the glibc build phase.

Yeah.  Dunno what to do about that.  I suspect I need to do something about
cond_syscall(), but I'm not sure what.

It's entirely possible that free_initmem() should not itself be marked __init.

debug_stub() needs to arrange for start_kernel() to be invoked on its first
entry, but can't itself be __init because it gets invoked on every debugging
event (single step, h/w breakpoints, break instruction, etc).  However, its
first call is right at the end of head.S, so it isn't actually a problem.
Note that it isn't possible to jump directly into the debugger.  You have to
take an debug-level exception to enter CPU debug mode - which is a level higher
than kernel mode.

Hmmm... pci_scan_child_bus() is not __*init, but it calls pcibios_fixup_bus()
which is.  That smells a trifle fishy.
