Hi Andrew,
I just noticed that the line 'extern const int
dlm_lvb_operations[8][8];' had been removed in the inline patch you just
mailed.
Sorry for not making it clear in my first mail, but that definition is
needed with CONFIG_DLM_DEVICE=y. Without it, the build fails at line 362
in drivers/dlm/device.c.
Regards,
Alexandre
