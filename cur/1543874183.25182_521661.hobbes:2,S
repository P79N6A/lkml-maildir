Subject: how core dump (core size) works

Hi All,
I have a large process (~ 2G address space) and I want to get a core
if this crashes in production. I haven't been able to get the core
file size to a low enough value so that this doesn't end up eating a
lot of disk space on small partitions.
In general, if I decrease the ulimit -c param, I've noticed that a
core is not dumped at all.
I'm sorry if this is not appropriate for this alias, I've searched
around a lot of forums and couldn't find an answer.
Thanks,
thushara
