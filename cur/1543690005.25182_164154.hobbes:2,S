Sorry about the delay in responding to this.
Anyway, I started doing it manually, but gave up since it would
mean copying/duplicating quite a bit of code from signal.c.
Instead I now do:
	BUG_ON(current->state != TASK_RUNNING);
	send_sig(SIG_ILL, current, 1);
I've checked sched.c and done runtime testing, and this does seem to
be true and work Ok. (Fingers crossed, knock on wood, etc.)
