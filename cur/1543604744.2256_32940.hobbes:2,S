Thanks Linus.  You are right, speeding up read() is the right thing to do.
In fact it was proposed here on this list years ago, and I think you
argued against it (TLB flush costs).  The costs and kernel
infrastructure have changed and maybe the idea could be revisited now.
Sometimes one has to be an idiot and explore an application of MAP_COPY
to get someone looking at sensible old ideas again :-)
have a nice day,
