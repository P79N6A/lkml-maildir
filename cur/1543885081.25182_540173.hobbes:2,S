Yes, it seems pointless to me ...

Hollis nominated me to be "hvsi people", although I'm near-totally
ignorant of the thing.
If hvsi_count is zero, then the device tree did not have any
"serial" nodes that speak "hvterm-protocol". The hvsi should not 
have even tried to register anything. The attached patch seems more 
to the point.
--linas
The hvsi driver is used whenever the device-tree contains
nodes for serial ports, and those serial ports speak the hvterm
protocol. However, if no such nodes are found, then the hvsi
driver should not even register. 
This patch avoids a kernel panic with "Couldn't register hvsi 
console driver". 
In addition, this patch makes tty_register_driver refuse
to do anything, if there are no actual tty ports to be 
registered.
Utterly & completely untested.
