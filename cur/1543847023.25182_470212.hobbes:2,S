AFAIK there is no demonstrated need for an API to suspend
individual devices.  Of course there's the question of who
would _use_ such a thing (some unspecified component, worth
designing one first), but drivers can use internal runtime
suspend mechanisms to be in low power modes and hide that
fact from the rest of the system.  That is, activate on
demand, suspend when idle.
