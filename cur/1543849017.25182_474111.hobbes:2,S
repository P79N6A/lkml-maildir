Subject: [PATCH](acpi:memory hotplug) Remove strange add_memory fail message
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello.
I wrote a patch to avoid redundant memory hot-add call at boot time.
This was cause of strange fail message of memory hotplug
like "ACPI: add_memory failed".
Memory is recognized by early boot code with EFI/E820.
But, if DSDT describes memory devices for them, then hot-add
code is called for already recognized memory, and it shows fail messages
with -EEXIST.
So, sys admin will misunderstand this message as something wrong by
it.
This patch avoids them by preventing redundant hot-add call until
completion of driver initialization. 
This patch is for 2.6.19-rc2.
I tested this patch on Tiger4 with my hot-add emulation.
Please apply.
