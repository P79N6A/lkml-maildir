On second thought, maybe not. I think your filesystem is at fault.
Firstly, there possibly is a bug in do_pagecache_readahead which allows 
it to
read off the end of the file in a completely serialised situation. But 
even so,
notice the absence of locking - i_size can change at any time can't it? Then
your fix will blow up when you race with a truncate, right?
I think you need to handle reading off the end of the file properly: I'm not
too familiar with this code, but IIRC you are allowed to setup pagecache 
past
the end of the file - it gets handled correctly in 
do_generic_mapping_read, and
ends up falling off the LRU. This should help you.
