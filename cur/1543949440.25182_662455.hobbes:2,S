this is a clear NAK since you gonna break all old CSR based dongles.  
Within the Bluetooth 1.0b and 1.1 specification there was an issues  
with if HCI_Reset should only reset the Bluetooth internals or also  
the transport. So issuing HCI_Reset on an old dongle will cause an USB  
reset.
The solution is to find the build id when CSR produced correct  
firmware and set the HCI_RESET quirk based on that. I meant to do this  
for a long time, but so far never got around to inquiry the correct  
build id where this got fixed.

Marcel
