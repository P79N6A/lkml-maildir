I'm not sure what the fuss is; a strict 386 kernel runs just fine
without any problems on an Athlon.  But anyway...
Dave, you are conflating "kernel compiled strictly for 386s" with
"compiled for lowest-common-denominator".
They are totally different configurations.  Isn't that why we have
"generic" now?
The latter is for distro boots.  The former is for that
386-as-a-firewall with 1MB of RAM, where it _really_ has to trim
everything it can, and no errata thank you.
I've not heard of anyone actually wanting a strict 386 kernel lately,
but strict 486 is not so unusual.
Just as some people want a P4 optimised kernel, and some people want a
K7 optimised kernel, so some people want a 386 or 486 or Pentium
optimised kernel.  Lowest-common-denominator means it runs on
everything, and isn't really anything to do with 386 any more - that's
not really the lowest-common-denominator, by virtue of the obvious
fact that pure 386 code isn't reliable on all other CPUs.

I agree.  It shouln't be possible to boot on the wrong hardware: it
should refuse.
There is precedent: X86_GOOD_APIC && X86_LOCAL_APIC: when booted on a
non-MMX P5, it refuses to boot, because it does not contain the errata
workaround.
Unfortunately the kernel has opposite precedents too.
By selecting a PII kernel, it is possible to configure out the code
for X86_PPRO_FENCE and X86_F00F_BUG, yet as far as I can tell, those
_can_ possibly boot on kernels where the errata are needed, and nary a
printk is emitted for it.  Nasty bugs they are, too.
More generally than the CPU, you can also configure out BLK_DEV_RZ1000
which is another crucial workaround that needs to go in any
lowest-common-denominator kernel.  Basically, if you're building a
distro boot kernel, you must turn on all known workarounds.  That's
certainly lowest-common-denominator, but it's a far cry from the
configuration that a 386-as-firewall user wants.

If the kernel had a consistent policy so far, it would be more clear,
but it doesn't.
