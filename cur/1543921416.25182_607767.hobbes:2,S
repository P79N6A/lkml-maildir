If the pci_intx change will be applied to the SATA driver, can it be
applied for the ATI USB-HCDs too? See
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/21/47
 for more details. That should help
most of the ATI MSI quirks. It helped me (Acer Aspire 502x laptop with
ATI RS480/SB400).

I am still somewhat confused: most people developing the Linux kernel
are limited to look at this hardware from the outside. They had to
find out by trial and error. I really hope your colleagues will be
more actively helping your team and (other) Linux kernel developers.
But I'm glad AMD has such a team.
(So while you're at it, ask about the ATI USB HCDs and any other MSI quirk too)
