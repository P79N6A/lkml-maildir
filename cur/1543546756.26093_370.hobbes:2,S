I'm not too sure about that.  If you want to do more things than a single
copy,
	if (copy_to_user(...))
		return -EFAULT;
	...;
	return 0;
is obviously required.  Also for those who don't trust strace (or don't have
it, or can't use it because -EFAULT is ambiguous)
	if (copy_to_user(...)) 
		return -EFAULT;
	printk("no fault\n");
	return 0;
might make sense.
