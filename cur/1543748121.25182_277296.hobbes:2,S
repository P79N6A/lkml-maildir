Experimenting with my simple memory allocation program for little more
time, I found that Free=MemTotal-Active gives kind of rough
approximation to the "free" memory amount. Can I make it somehow better?
What about SwapCached or Inact_target? Are there any pointers to the
information I might find useful on this subject other than

Thanks

P.S. I need this to work with 2.4.19+ and 2.6 kernels...
