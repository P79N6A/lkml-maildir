Subject: [PATCH 04/13] regulator: fixed regulator interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/2/288

This patch adds support for fixed regulators. This class of regulator is
not software controllable but can coexist on machines with software
controllable regulators.
