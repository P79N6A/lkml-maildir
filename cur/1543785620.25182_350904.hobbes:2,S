I consider them all to be 2.6.14 material, which is why I sent them.
With the exception of uml-breakpoint-an-arbitrary-thread.patch, which
adds a bit of functionality, they are all bug fixes and code
movement/cleanup.  In order of my preference of reaching mainline:
uml-remove-include-of-asm-elfh.patch
	serious bug - this fixes the x86_64 build
uml-preserve-errno-in-error-paths.patch
	serious bug - if you hit some of these, UML will hang
uml-return-a-real-error-code.patch
	a small bug, almost a cleanup
uml-remove-a-useless-include.patch
uml-remove-an-unused-file.patch
uml-remove-some-build-warnings.patch
	code cleanup
uml-move-libc-code-out-of-mem_userc-and-tempfilec.patch
uml-merge-mem_userc-and-memc.patch
	code movement
uml-_switch_to-code-consolidation.patch
	code cleanup - can be omitted from mainline if
	uml-breakpoint-an-arbitrary-thread.patch is
uml-breakpoint-an-arbitrary-thread.patch
	functionality
