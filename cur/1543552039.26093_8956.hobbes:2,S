Can I completely ignore vm_pgoff in nopage()?  Currently I just do the
following, to get the page number relative to the start of the vma:
	pgoff = (address - vma->vm_start) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
where 'address' is the value passed to nopage().

The first draft of code had only
	vma->vm_ops = &via_mm_ops;
	vma->vm_private_data = card;
and userspace apps segfaulted.  I then added the two objectionable
lines, and things started working:
	vma->vm_flags |= VM_LOCKED | VM_SHM; /* Don't swap */
	vma->vm_file = file;
Have not yet checked any combinations in between...

	Jeff
