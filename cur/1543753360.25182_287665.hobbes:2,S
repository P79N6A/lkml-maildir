There of course has to be some kind of end marker, but that's less 
critical as it's not the active buffer anymore.

Sorry, you missunderstood me. At the moment I'm only secondarily 
interested in the API details, primarily I want to work out the details of 
what exactly relayfs/ltt are supposed to do. One main question here I 
can't answer yet, why you insist on multiple relayfs modes.
This is what I basically have in mind for the relay_write function:
	cpu = get_cpu();
	buffer = relay_get_buffer(chan, cpu);
	while(1) {
		offset = local_add_return(buffer->offset, length);
		if (likely(offset + length <= buffer->size))
			break;
		buffer = relay_switch_buffer(chan, buffer, offset);
	}
	memcpy(buffer->data + offset, data, length);
	put_cpu();
ltt_log_event should only be a few lines more (for writing header and 
event data).
What I'd like to know now are the reasons why you need more than this.
It's not the amount of data and any timing requirements have to be done by 
the caller. During processing you either take the events in the order they 
were recorded (often that's good enough) or you sort them which is not 
that difficult.

I know you don't want to touch the topic of kernel debugging, but its 
requirements greatly overlap with what you want to do with ltt, e.g. one 
needs very often information about scheduling events as many kernel 
processes rely more and more on kernel threads. The only real requirement 
for kernel debugging is low runtime overhead, which you certainly like to 
have as well. So what exactly are these requirements and why can't there 
be no reasonable alternative?
bye, Roman
