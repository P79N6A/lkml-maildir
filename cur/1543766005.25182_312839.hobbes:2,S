I think it is not needed. The check should be able to handle overflow case also.
This probably assumes that you don't sleep longer than (2e32 - 1) jiffies
(which is ~1193 hrs). Current VST implementation let us sleep way less than that
limit (~896 ms) since it uses 32-bit number for sampling TSC. When it is
upgraded to use 64-bit number, we may have to ensure that this limit (1193 hrs)
is not exceeded.
