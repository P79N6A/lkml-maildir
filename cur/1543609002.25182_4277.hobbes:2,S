Subject: multiple identical nfs mounts allowed

I understand this has been discussed before in a limited way 
(
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0108.1/0070.html
 is all I 
could find), but what is the justification for allowing multiple identical 
nfs mounts?
eg
# mount server:/export /mnt
# mount server:/export /mnt
will give this:
# mount | grep server
server:/export on /mnt type nfs (rw,addr=192.168.1.210)
server:/export on /mnt type nfs (rw,addr=192.168.1.210)
This is not possible with block devices.
Is this at all a dangerous state of affairs?
thanks
ABeet.
