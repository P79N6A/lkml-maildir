Hi,
I am facing a problem where-in some files are not visible across NFS and 
hence, not able to read those files. However, after sometime, the files 
become visible and the data is accessible. I have tried to do an 'ls -l' 
operation on the directory and repeat it till the directory gets mounted 
and visible. This works in some cases but sometimes fails as well.
Is there any reliable way of ensuring that the directory gets mounted 
and all files in it are visible before accessing the data ??
Any help/pointers in this regard would be really great.
-Thanks & Regards
Sai
