good to hear.  I hadn't experienced interupted system calls, but it's
been a bit since I've done any serious unix programming (will change
soon thankfully).

Yes, that was what this started with.  Which is why what I was thinking
was a library
call that wrapped select (shoot the code for the wrapper is already in
Apache).
