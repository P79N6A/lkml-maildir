Hello everyone,
I've rolled up some fixes for older kernels and fixed an uninitialized 
variables in btrfs-progs that could cause an oops on mount.  I'll wait a few 
days to see if other bug reports come in and cut a 0.15 with any other 
critical fixes.
Until then, you can find download information on the important fixes so far:
