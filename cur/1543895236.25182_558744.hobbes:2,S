This sounds like a good argument, but it doesn't hold water.
Consider this: We manufacture bread toasters and sell them in the
market with great success.  They're big and bulky.  So the engineers
work on reducing its size, but in a way they can still fit perfectly a
slice of bread.  When we launch bread toaster, people complain that
this new product cannot toast bagels any more, that we've changed the
spirit of the bread toaster.
See?  Just because you could use it for other purposes doesn't make
the intent behind it any different.

It just shows that they've never agreed with the spirit of the license
in the first place.  They just saw it could do something else, and
used it for this reason.  There's nothing wrong about this.
What's wrong is to complain that those who introduced the license with
a specific and public intent, and that advancing that intent with a
new revision of the license, are changing the intent.
