i've uploaded -5 with a fix in profile_tick() - does it boot fine for
you now?
Btw., a good way to catch such early bootup bugs is to activate
early-printk over the serial console:
 earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,38400 console=ttyS0,38400 console=tty0
and in this particular case the most effective serial logging method is:
 earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,38400,keep console=ttyS0,38400 console=tty0
the 'keep' tells the kernel to keep the early console a bit longer -
which in this particular timer-interrupt crash case produces a more
usable log. (the 'keep' parameter makes the serial console a bit less
useful as a regular console later on, so it should only be used for
crashes that the normal early console doesnt catch.)
