That's true, but there are other good reasons. Here are two: memory can be
implicitly allocated, and the kernel uses memory dynamically.
And actually it isn't all _that_ different. The kernel has to deny a
resource to user-space if that resource is used up. Most programs will
cease to function if you deny them a resource that they really need.
Memory is the most fundamental of resources.
