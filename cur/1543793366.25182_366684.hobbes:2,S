In case of user space probes we adopt a similar method for executing the code
out-of-line. In user space probes  we find free space in the current
 process address space and copy the original instruction to that location and
 execute that instruction from that location. User processes use stack space
 to store local variables, agruments and return values. Normally the stack
 space either below or above the stack pointer indicates the free stack space.
Also in case of no stack free space, we can expand the process stack, copy the 
instruction and execute the instruction from that location.
Detials about this method is discussed on systemtap mailing lists. URL is below.

Please let me know if you have any other solution to the above problem.
Thanks
