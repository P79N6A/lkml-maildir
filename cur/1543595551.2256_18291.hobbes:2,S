! This problem occurs, nomatter wether ECN is enabled or disabled !:
Since upgrading to Linux 2.4.5 (ECN disabled!) I'm unable to connect to any
hosts which are located behind a Bintec Brick router (the brick performs
port forwarding).
When I'm trying to connect from a Linux 2.2 machine, I have no problems
at all.
Are there any known networking problems between Linux 2.4 and
Bintec routers?
