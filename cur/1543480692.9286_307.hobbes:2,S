Hi!
After the changes to pc_keyb.c in 2.2.0-pre8, the kernel fails to
detect my PS/2 mouse. The problem seems to be in
detect_auxiliary_port(), but I am not sure.
I backed out the changes to pc_keyb.c in 2.2.0-pre8 and then the
kernel was able to detect my mouse.
More information (like system information) is available on request.
Thanks,
peloy.-
