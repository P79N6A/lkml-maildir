Actually I run it on 1-4 CPUs (don't have more to try), but didn't 
always bother to report everything.. With the default
mm5 scheduler the bandwidth of 1,2,3,4 is constantly like 1 CPU.
I agree with you that the "balancing on fork is bad" assumption is dubious
at best. For HPC it definitly is wrong, for others it is unproven as well.
As I wrote earlier our own results on HyperThreaded machines running 2.4
were similar. On HT at least early balancing seems to be a win too - 
it's obvious because there is no cache cost to be paid when you move
between two virtual CPUs on the same core.

Choice is probably not bad, but a good default is important too.
I'm not really sure doing it by default would be such a bad idea.
A thread allocating some memory on its own is probably not that unusual,
even outside the HPC space. And on a NUMA system you want that already
on the final node.
