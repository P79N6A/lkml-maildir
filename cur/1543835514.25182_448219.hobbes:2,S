The daemon sets the list of acceptable channels, the transmission powers 
for each of them and modifies this based on things like the temperature.
Oh, yes, and it writes 802.11 scan frames that get passed straight to 
the firmware and broadcast. Insane crack. For reasons I don't as yet 
understand, various received frames also get passed back up to the 
daemon. I probably really don't want to know why.
