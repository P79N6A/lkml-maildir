I think it stops counting only CERTAIN events. That's where it becomes difficult
to interpret. There was a defect like this on Itanium 2.

Yes, the way it is implemented today means that nothing happening while the idle
threads runs/sleeps is counted. Monitoring is disabled at context switch boundaries
for task->pid==0.
I would rather have something that would stop counting *EVERYTHING* ONLY when
going low-power OR when busy looping. That's why the idle notififers that Andi mentioned
are interesting. But this would not cover interrupts received while in idle and yet we
want to measure those as they represent useful kernel work. This is unless interrupts while
idle qualifies for an exit_idle() notification.
