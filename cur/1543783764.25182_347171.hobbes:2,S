And the boogeyman might really exist too.
This is just hypotetical hand-waving.

Fedora kernels have been built with 4K stacks for a long time.
(Since even before the option went upstream). The only things that
have been reported to have problems with 4KB stacks are..
- NDISwrapper / driverloader.
  (Shock, horror - no-one cares).
- XFS when used in conjunction with RAID
  Fixed now ?  (Though Neil Brown does have a pending patch for md
  to make that use less stack, which will also help).
- Reiser4
  Fixed 'soon'.

This is what was proposed not long after the option got merged.
"After a while" has passed by quite a stretch.
