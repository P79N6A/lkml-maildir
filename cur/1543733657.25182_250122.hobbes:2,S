Thanks Ingo. Here goes my .config, altough Q3 specific it's been the base
for all others (from Q5 to R6).
Few moments ago, Tim Savannah was kind enough to send me it's working
.config for 2.6.9-rc1-bk13 with ck patch and voluntary
preempt R6. At first glance it seems that he takes the monolithic approach
while I prefer all-modular. The other main difference is that he has
HIGHMEM disabled, while I'm on HIGHMEM(4GB) 'coz my machine has 1GB of RAM
:)
I didn't test Tim's configuration yet, as I can only do it when I get back
home tonight. I'll wait for yours too then.
Thanks again.
