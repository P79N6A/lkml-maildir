Ohhhhh... Now I see :)
CKRM is using too much heavy framework, with hierarchical settings and 
so on, but little practical things.
Our approach is totally different, we make it simple and straitforward 
and all resource management features are compile-time configurable.

it depends. if you want trully secure environment in Linux, resource 
management is a MUST. Also, per-process management is not natural from 
user POV.
