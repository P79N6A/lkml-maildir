Guessing from the symptoms I would rather suggest that:
1. Are you sure you have the support for your chipset properly
    enabled? It's allmost a must for DMA.
2. Could you please report about the hardware you have. There are
    chipsets around there which are using theyr own transport layer
    implementations. host chip (aka south bridge) disk types and so on.
3. Some timeout values got increased to more generally used values (in esp.
    IBM microdrives advice about timeout values. Could you see whatever
    the data doesn't eventually go to the disk after georgeous
    amounts of time.
4. Could you try to set the DMA mode lower then it's set up
    per default by using hdparm and try whatever it helps?
