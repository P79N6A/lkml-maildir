a generic "IO trace"  function (as config
option) sounds actually like a good idea... that could do a direct call
if the config option is enabled (as well as some sysctl thing I
suspect, so that you can turn it on and off as you want)... I would
entirely support one of those going to mainline.
The problem with a chain is that those are quite expensive to run, and
page faults should really be a fast operation... so the normal case
should be a light as possible.
