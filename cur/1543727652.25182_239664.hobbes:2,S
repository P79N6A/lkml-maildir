Let me attempt to clarify here.  You have two fd's open against the same
file and you are reading in the following manner:
fd1:   0-11k        33-44k        55-66k
fd2:         11-22k        44-55k
yes?
If correct, I think you're expecting a bit too much of the readahead
system.  If you have a real application which is using such access patterns
perhaps it should be taught to use POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED.
