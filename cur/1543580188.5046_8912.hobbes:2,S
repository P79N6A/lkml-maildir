this is known: Linus decreed that, since two people reported 
disk corruption on VIA, any machine with a VIA southbridge
must boot in stupid 1992 mode (PIO).  (yes, it might be possible
to boot with ide=autodma or something, but who would guess?)
Linus: I hope you don't consider this a releasable state!
VIA now owns 40% of the chipset market...
