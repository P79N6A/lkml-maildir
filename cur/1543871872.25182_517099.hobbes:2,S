Yes, the problem starts with USB resets (or USB errors that trigger a reset)

Recently, the USB drive has choked up after several hours of moderate
use. However, before this instance, it would consistently hang up my
watchdog process and force a system reboot (no idea why; the watchdog
process didn't use this drive at all). This may have changed when I
upgraded from 2.6.20-rc6-mm3 to 2.6.20-mm2, but my sample size is to
small to be sure.
