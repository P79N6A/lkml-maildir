I've got the Extreme Linux installation CD for i386, but it won't boot on
the intended victims: Some incompatibility with the PCI devices. OTOH,
RedHat-5.2 installs fine, so I guess this is just a problem with the
outdated kernel (2.0.33 + patches).
Now the question is: Has somebody ported the Beowulf patches forward to
recent kernels? Recent 2.0.xx or even 2.2.x? Does it even make any sense to
do so?  Which of the patches are critical, which ones aren't? Any areas
where I should look out for tarpits?
I'm asking before trying to integrate the patches myself, as surely
somebody more knowledgeable than myself has done so already ;-)
Thanks for any help!
