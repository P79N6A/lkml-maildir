Dell Latitude C840 laptop.  Didn't see this under 2.5.59.
Calibrating delay loop... 3145.72 BogoMIPS
Memory: 255056k/262024k available (2010k kernel code, 6248k reserved, 895k data,
 104k init, 0k highmem)
Debug: sleeping function called from illegal context at mm/slab.c:1618
Call Trace:
 [<c0135353>] kmem_cache_alloc+0x51/0x55
 [<c013490f>] kmem_cache_create+0x6c/0x448
 [<c0105000>] _stext+0x0/0x22
Security Scaffold v1.0.0 initialized
System continues on just fine however.  Quick perusal of the source seems
to smell like an uninitialized flag in a function call, but I don't know
where. The call trace seems wonky - addresses near _stext in the System.map:
c0104000 T empty_zero_page
c0105000 T _stext
c0105000 T stext
c0105000 t rest_init
c0105022 t do_pre_smp_initcalls
c010502b t init
c010517d t unlock_kernel
but unless there's some macro-expansion wizardry none of these guys call
kmem_cache_create directly, so it seems almost like some stack frames are
missing.
Does this ring a bell, or does anybody have a hint how to start debugging
this?
