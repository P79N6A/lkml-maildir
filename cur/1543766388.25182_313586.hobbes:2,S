2.6.11 and 2.6.11.7 work fine.
2.6.12-rc1 2.6.12-rc2 and 2.6.12-rc3 fail to read partiton table on my laptop,
also 2.6.12-rc3 works fine on another box also running FullPliant.
The meaningfull part of the boot sequence log is:
With 2.6.11.x:
hda: 117210240 sectors (60011 MB) w/8192KiB Cache, CHS=65535/16/63, UDMA(100)
hda: cache flushes supported
 hda: hda1
With 2.6.12-rcx:
hda: 117210240 sectors (60011 MB) w/8192KiB Cache, CHS=65535/16/63, UDMA(100)
hda: cache flushes supported
 hda:
so with 2.6.12-rcx, the boot process ends with an unpleasant:
VFS: Cannot open root device "301" or unknown-bloc(3,1)
The partition table has been created by Pliant partition tool:
http://fullpliant.org/pliant/linux/storage/partition.pli
function 'partition_create' at line 52.
Since most of you are probably not awared of Pliant programming language,
neither FullPliant operating system,
I've attached 'dd if=/dev/hda of=/tmp/partition.bin bs=512 count=1'[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
