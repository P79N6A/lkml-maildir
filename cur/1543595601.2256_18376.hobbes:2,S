If you don't have free memory, you are limited to 2 choices:
1) wait on IO
2) spin endlessly, wasting CPU until the IO is done
If (1) isn't possible in reiserfs, I'd say something in
reiserfs needs to be fixed, otherwise you will always
have problems when the system has lots of dirty mappings
that need to be written out.

Rik
