From a 32-bit long perspective, bit 0 of a long is always the bit which
represents odd numbers.  Where this falls depends on the endianness:
                       MSB                    LSB
big-endian long0:      byte0  byte1  byte2  byte3
little-endian long0:   byte3  byte2  byte1  byte0
Bit 0 of a BE long ends up at byte 3 bit 0.
Bit 0 of a LE long ends up at byte 0 bit 0.
However, bit 0 of a byte stream is always byte 0 bit 0.
Hence, converting the bitops to take a different sized pointer from
the one we presently pass changes the semantics of the function for
big endian machines - by the fact that you change the order of bits
in memory.
Whether this matters or not is up to how the bitops are used.  If
it's something which only bitops operate on, it probably doesn't
make that much difference.  If it's some external data or some
data which is accessed in other ways, it most certainly does matter.
