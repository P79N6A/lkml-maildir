This is a lot of code for a very special case.
Could you try to put all the xip code into a separate file, e.g. mm/xip.c
that's only built when CONFIG_XIP is set?  It would probably require
duplicating a little more code if you want clean interfaces, e.g. probably
a separate set of generic operations.
