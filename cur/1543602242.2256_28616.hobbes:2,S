dear all,
i just built a system:
	1.3GHz amd athlon
	epox 8kha ddr motherboard
		via kt266 (vt8366, vt8233)
	768MB ddr ram
	radeon QD with 64MB video buffer, tvio
i enabled agpgart, and got the message:
  Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
  agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 690M
  agpgart: Unsupported Via chipset (device id: 3099), you might want to try
    agp_try_unsupported=1.
  agpgart: no supported devices found.
  [drm] Initialized radeon 1.1.1 20010405 on minor 0
i rebuilt the kernel with agpgart built as a module.  rebooted.  loaded the
agp module with:
  insmod /usr/src/linux-2.4.9/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o agp_try_unsupported=1
loaded the radeon driver with:
  insmod /usr/src/linux-2.4.9/drivers/char/drm/radeon.o
this was successful -- DRI was enabled when i started X (and i played quake3
to reward myself).
i read that success with agp_try_unsupported=1 should be reported here, so
i'm reporting it.  please feel free to ask further questions if you want to
know about my hardware.
i do have 2 questions:
1. modprobe didn't seem to know where agpgart.o and radeon.o lives, so i had
   to resort to insmod.  is there a way of telling modprobe where to look for
   modules?
2. i recompiled the kernel but built agpgart in rather than loading it as a
   module.  i then inserted the following line into /etc/lilo.conf:
      append="agp_try_unsupported=1"
   but it didn't seem to work.  someone told me that to get agp work to work
   for my system, agpgart MUST be built as a module and you MUST pass it the
   argument agp_try_unsupported=1.  in other words, you can't build it into
   the kernel and pass the argument as a kernel parameter at boot time.
   is that true?
please cc replies to p@dirac.org.
thanks guys!
pete
