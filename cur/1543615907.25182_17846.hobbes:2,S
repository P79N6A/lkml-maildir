Hi,
i've tried to export a reiserfs volume over nfs (knfsd).
First kexportfs fails with "invalid argument", and mounts
are failing with a "reason given by server: Permission denied".
All subsequent exports succeeded.
The same is in 2.4.18-pre1. 2.4.17 looks ok.
I suspect that unexport everything before first export
could also make it work properly.
