Agreed.  The sequence should be to send patches to get rid of
all "#include <asm/segment.h>" references.
Once they have all gone, then a patch can remove the files.
If you are concerned that people would start adding new
references and you don't want to get into a game of whack-a-mole,
then you could add #warning "include of deprecated asm/segment.h",
but that might be overkill.
I'll apply this for ia64 w/o the deletion.
