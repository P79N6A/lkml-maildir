I've seen more minimal minimal configs but if it works
it is 50% of success.

Was this lock-up effect visible during above 2.6.19-rc1 tests?
If not I'd try to continue linux debbuging:
- is 2.6.19-rc1 working with "normal" config (use make oldconfig
to "upgrade" .config),
- is 2.6.17 working with "minimal" config (use make oldconfig),
- changing one or two options at a time try to find which one makes
the effect returns (acpi, smp...).
