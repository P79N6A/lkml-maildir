Hi Brian,
I believe the patch which follows will fix your "Error -16..."
problem with the orinoco_cs driver.
I sent the patch to David Gibson a couple weeks of ago but have
not heard from him yet.

Hi David,
The patch which follows "fixes" a problem I'm seeing with the
orinoco_cs wireless driver.  The problem results in the error
"Error -110 writing packet header to BAP," and the connection locks up.
This happens almost immediately with the link active. I see this problem
with old "Wavelan Bronze" cards which the driver reports as "Firmware ID 1F
vendor 0x1 (Lucent) version 3.06."  I'm assuming that the problem
is a feature of this old hardware/firmware.  
The change is to some existing error handling (avoidance?) code
which retries if it detects an error setting a BAP offset.  My change
also does this retry if the operation times out.  I looked at the
wvlan_cs driver (which just works) to see if it had a similar
workaround.  It doesn't.
