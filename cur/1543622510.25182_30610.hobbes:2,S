Can you try a file between 2^31 and 2^32-1, inclusive?  Maybe it's a
sign-related bug in the loopback driver, not a 64 bit I/O bug.
The file I tried to mount is this on an NTFS partition:
12/10/2001  20:13     3,522,562,048 dvd.iso
"losetup" fails too, meaning it's the loopback driver (and possibly the NTFS
driver) that is glitching, not the ISO driver.
Maybe trying to mount *anything* from an NTFS driver doesn't work?  I'll
have to check that possibility too...

I'm not aware if there's a fix in this patch. afaik it
