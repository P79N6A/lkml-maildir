I guess a) is okay. There are not *so* many remote controls out there.
I loose a tiny bit of flexibility: if I take DAV remote that happens
to almost work with bttv, I was able to use most of its keys with
lircd, but kernel module will not permit me to do that.
I guess thats okay; if I want decoder-that-decodes-anything, I need
one that connects to serial port and has non-trivial configuration.
