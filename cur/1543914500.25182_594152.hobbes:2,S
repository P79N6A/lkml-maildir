You removed Bernhard from the cc list.
I'd like to know a little bit more about why this is needed, how it will be
used, etc.  And given that this feature is intended to improve life for
distributors, it would be nice to get some feedback from the appropriate
persons.
So could you please redo the patch as Jermey suggests (if you agree),
revamp the description and then cc suitable people at suitable distros so
we can get their input?
Thanks.
