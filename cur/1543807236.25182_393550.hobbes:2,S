Not quite as I tried that once and it didn't intercept every
->end_request call. I've just traced this to an explicit call to
ide_end_request() rather than drv->end_request() in ide-taskfile.c
The patch below might or might not be an appropriate fix. With this
applied, the led trigger simplifies to:

Ensure ide-taskfile.c calls any driver specific end_request function
if present.
