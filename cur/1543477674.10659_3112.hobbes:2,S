What is the presentation of the interface, eg is it a network device? 
I suppose note if it uses char device structures.  I've ported a
driver for a multi-channel WAN card, but chose to make it a network
device to utilize the benefits of being one.

I guess I'm confused about what you mean by "HDLC line discipline". 
HDLC implies frames, bit stuffing, CRC, etc...  Most WAN interface
cards provide HDLC support in hardware, with configurations, eg 16 or
32 bit CRC, frame flag selection (eg 7e in most circumstances).  
In any event, I'm an interested party.  I've got the port mentioned
above, which unfortunately is a half breed GPL/other.  We haven't
shipped it / sold product with it, so no issues there, we used it for
internal R&D for an evaluation which is complete.  ImageStream has
also done a port of another WAN driver, but it's completely
proprietary AFAIK. I used dlci.c and sdla.c (in the standard kernel
distributions) as starter material, and will happily share those, but
the proprietary stuff we don't own, and cannot disclose anyhow.
