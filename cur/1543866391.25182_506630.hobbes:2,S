Subject: [PATCH 5/5] sysctl:  Hide the sysctl proc inodes from selinux.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/8/259

Since the security checks are applied on each read and write of a
sysctl file, just like they are applied when calling sys_sysctl, they
are redundant on the standard VFS constructs.  Since it is difficult
to compute the security labels on the standard VFS constructs we just
mark the sysctl inodes in proc private so selinux won't even bother
with them.
