Well, unshare(CLONE_VM) is not yet supported. Currently (as I see
it) mm->mmap_sem is enough to protect against changing ->mm. Yes,
exit_mm/exec_mmap take task_lock too, so it can be used as well.
Please correct my understanding.
I think it is better to take ->mmap_sem in sys_unshare, this path
is rare.
