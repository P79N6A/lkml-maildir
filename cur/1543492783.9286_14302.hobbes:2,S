I think you are missing the point. 
It really doesnt matter where in the code you put your fix.
The issue is why is this acceptable? Why is your patch in the kernel
proper?
Where do you draw the line? For example:
Did you know that most windows machines are *not* capable of 3 dupack
generation? The maximum i have see is 2 dupacks (maybe MS has fixed that
now, but not in the environment i am in). In essence, when you use them as
a client; a lost packet means a transmit timeout. 
So are you willing to put a hack in there for this MS problem since there 
are a lot of Windows clients (more than solrais boxes) which will visit
Linux servers? 
I think this has to stop. Linux is mature enough to not care about this
little issues. There are a lot of 'unofficial' patches servers -- this is
where such patches belong
