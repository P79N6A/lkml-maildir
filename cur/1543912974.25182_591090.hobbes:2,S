Then go yell at Mr. Floeter. The code is dual-licensed and he put BSD-License 
only code in it. Because that's the *EXACT* *SAME* thing you're talking 
about.
IANAL, but your argument is specious - if the code is dual-licensed and you 
are going to let one person add code to it that is only licensed under one of 
those licenses, you *CANNOT* complain when somebody else does it and chooses 
the other license. (Well, you can, but the complaint has no legal standing)

Then why aren't you complaining about Mr. Floeters code ?
His code doesn't maintain the dual-license. I think the reason is that you 
could care less about the "Dual License" and you just want the code - period.

The same can be said of Floeters code. *ALL* of his code, IIRC, is 
*SINGLE-LICENSE*. ie: a complexity trap. But you aren't complaining about his 
code - you are complaining that somebody is doing the same thing, but is 
using the side of the dual-license you don't like.
Nothing *LEGALLY* actionable there.

Exactly.
If you want to only have your code available under a specific license but rely 
on dual-licensed code, you create a fork that contains the new code under 
that side of the license. For instance: Suppose I've written a new filesystem 
and released it with three licenses - CDDL, BSD/ISC and GPL(v2) - and a Linux 
developer decides to import my FS into Linux. But the code isn't optimal for 
Linux, so he fixes it - and only wants his code usable under the GPLv2 - he 
can do this - it just means that that fork isn't usable under the other two 
licenses.
Note that the boundary of what a "work" consists of is complex - but as far as 
a computer program goes it is "the collection of source code needed to build 
the functional result" or "the functional result". 
This means that I can contribute as much code as I want to a project under 
whatever license I choose, but the project itself can have a different 
license. In the case of the code in question, that means that the second Mr. 
Floeters code was distributed as a part of the "whole work" that constitutes 
the Atheros driver it automatically fell under the dual-license of the 
controlling project. When Jiri downloaded the code and began the work of 
porting it to Linux, he accepted the terms of the GPL license - his choice to 
make. However, the initial patches altered the licensing of files that, 
individually, have a different license. That was illegal and pointed out to 
him - and that code *WAS* *NOT* accepted into Linux.
In other words: everyone claiming that Jiri making changes that are GPLv2 only 
is illegal needs to learn the law. And Theo's statement about Alan Cox fully 
constitutes Libel (Slander?). (I've never looked into the specifics of those 
laws - so I'm not sure which one e-mail falls under, however it is one of 
those)
To the 90% of the people that are following Theo's lead and bitching that they 
can't import Jiri's changes because they are solely GPL:
STFU, OK ? -- Your position isn't legally tenable *AT* *ALL*.
(Okay, so it might be that any Atheros driver containing Jiri's changes loses 
the dual-license because of the viral nature of the GPL... IANAL, but I can't 
see that happening in this case.)
