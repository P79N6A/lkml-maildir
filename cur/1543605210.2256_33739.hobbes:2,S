Hi,
the mouse needs to be reinitialized after being replugged. First it needs to
be enabled and then set to the protocol it uses (if different from plain
PS/2). This should be handled by mouse driver, i.e. gpm and X11.
However, it isn't. 
There once was a kernel patch to do the first part (it can't do the second,
asw the kernel has not the slightest clue about the specifics of the mouse),
but
* it was bad design (should be done in userspace, where knowledge baout the
  specific mouse id present)
* broke some mouses (synps2 most notably)
so it got disbaled. You can try reenabling by using the parammeter
psaux-reconnect and check whether this makes a difference.
I don't have the slightest clue why it affects yoiur keyboard.
Regards,
