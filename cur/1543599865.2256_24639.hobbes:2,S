Diald killed pppd
I recently installed diald 0.99.4. into RH 7.1 2.4.3-12. After diald
is started it listens for http requests and initializes pppd with
the chat program and connect script. The problem is that since the
first time I ran diald, pppd no longer works with any command or
dialup tool. It worked fine before with no problems. Using RedHats
"Dialup configuration tool" I highlighted the ppp0 interface and
clicked on the debug button. After it finished I was asked to create
& save a log file. I named it "ppp.log" this was what it looks like:

SvV- something is wrong with pppd, I wonder what error (exit code=10)
means?
Checking the /var/log/messages I looked at entries related to ppp:

The previous day entries shows that pppd worked and interface ppp0 was
started
and running. How do I fix the pppd daemon?
