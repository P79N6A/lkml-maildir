I'm afraid that it really is a problem.
Existing user space, some of which I have written myself, is going to
respond very poorly to being told that an input device does X and Y, and
then abruptly having the device start doing Z on us.  No matter it's a
new few buttons, a new few keys, or a touch-pad added to the keyboard,
it's just not going to be happy, and it is most definitely not going to
actually support the new events.
This is a real killer.  You can remove the input device and reregister
it with new capabilities[0], you can wait to register until you know them
all, but you can't change those of an existing device without breaking
userspace.
0: If you keep all the ID identical, userspace may have the capabilities
cached.  This may also cause problems, but if Dmitry or Greg calls that
a userspace bug I'll believe them and find a workaround.  But existing
user space _may_ break in roughly the same ways as if you just change
capabilities on an existing input device, that said, remove and readd
would be greatly preferred just because it does give us a chance to see
that something changed.

I could imagine that there might be some GPL project out there that
_deserves_ getting sued(*) and it has nothing to do with Linux.
