I don't believe so. You're describing the precise effect of finite-
quantum FB (or tiny quantum RR) on long-running tasks. Generally
multilevel queues are used to back off to a service-time dependent
queueing discipline (e.g. use RR with increasing quanta for each level
and use level promotion and demotion to discriminate interactive tasks,
which remain higher-priority since overall policy is FB) with longer
timeslices for such beasts for less context-switching overhead. I say
lengthen timeslices with service time and make priority preemption work.
