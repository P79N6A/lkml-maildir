Three cheers for John Stultz for plugging at this as long as he has!   
Despite the ugly code, the many requested changes and revisions, etc,  
he's made awesome progress.  These are sorely needed changes and we  
should thank John  (and all the rest of the participants) for their  
time on this particular project.  Hurrah to you sirs!
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett

Somone asked me why I work on this free (
http://www.fsf.org/
 
philosophy/) software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz  
had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."
