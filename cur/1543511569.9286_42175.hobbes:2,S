I'm implementing ACLs. Project location:
<
http://major.rithus.co.at/acl/>.
For utilities like `ls', I need a flag `has extended access
control information' in `struct stat'. Also, some operations
in the VFS can be optimized with such a flag. An ioctl() call
is inappropriate; this really belongs in the VFS.
Here is what I want ls to do. (This is also how Solaris
implements it):
	andy@snowball:/acl/test > ls -l
	-rw-rw----   1 andy     toolies         5 Oct  5 13:27 file1
	-rw-rw----+  1 andy     toolies         5 Oct  5 13:27 file2  
I simply would have added a bit to the st_mode field in struct stat;
that would have done the job. Unfortunately on i386 systems, st_mode
is 16 bits wide, all bits used.
I know this will break some scripts. The scripts need to be changed,
simply.
