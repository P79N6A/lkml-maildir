The problem with this case is that pci_enable_device() is the very first thing that the driver
calls, but (as I understand it) I have no hope of sending commands to the device until this
function returns. This is a "catch 22" situation from my perspective, because how am I supposed to
know which device interrupt to disable if I can't call pci_enable_device()?
Does the 2.4 kernel survive because IRQs are disabled globally during module_init() or something?
Cheers,
Chris
