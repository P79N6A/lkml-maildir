I've tried what you propouse me but when I make:
	patch -p1 < linux-2.2.7-sunrpc.patch
the system ask me:
	*.c ...
	Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected ! Assume -R? [n]
It's possible that my kernel 2.2.10 is newer (although I think I have
installed knfsd 1.4.6) and then "patch" tells me that warning ?
Please, could you give me a little help on this: I'm newbie and never made
kernel updates or applying patches. Please could you give more detailed
instructions ?
I want to thank you very much your help.

- Apply the following patches included with that package to the kernel:
linux-2.2.7-sunrpc.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-3.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-nfsfh.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-2.lockd.patch
Life should then improve considerably.  I've given up trying to understand
why these are not in the base kernel, so don't ask...
