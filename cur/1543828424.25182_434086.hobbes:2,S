Subject: [PATCH 10/15] frv: initrd is grossly broken on frv (never built)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/19/145

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>
The FRV arch doesn't currently support initrd, so it should be disabled
automatically for the moment.
