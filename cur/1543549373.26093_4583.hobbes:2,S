BTW is this right? Does kill -9 guarantee that all syscalls are dead by
the time it returns from kernel? Because if not, then race is pretty clear.
[And I'm pretty sure that kill -9 does *NOT* guarantee that.]
Try adding sleep 1 before umount -a

I've seen this in past with various -testX and older. I doubt it is 
mainoard-specific.
