There's this patch which was intended to fix it:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/22/148
which hasn't been merged yet. I see now that there was some further 
discussion from someone saying that didn't fix the problem for them, 
which I wasn't CCed on.. It looks like in their case, libata is 
receiving SGs with DMA addresses above 4GB even though the block layer 
bounce limit is set to 32-bit. That's the mechanism that sata_nv depends 
on to ensure that it gets proper addresses when accessing ATAPI devices 
where it is limited to 32-bit DMA.. Could that be breaking or 
insufficient somehow?
