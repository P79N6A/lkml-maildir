Not sure that this should come from the bio mempool. Objects
allocated from the mem pool are expected to be released back to
the pool within a reasonable period (after i/o is done), which is
not quite the case here.
Dump preallocates the bio early when configured and holds on to 
it all through the time the system is up (avoids allocs at 
actual dump time). Doesn't seem like the right thing to hold
on to a bio mempool element that long.
