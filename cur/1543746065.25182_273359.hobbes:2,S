Hi people,
 A straight forward question. Wouldn't adding a "file as a directory"
mechanism more logical in VFS itself, rather than having each fs (like
reiser4) to implement it seperately? My vision is to give archive-file
(.tar, .tar.gz, ...) support in the VFS itself, and of course
transparent to any fs and any user-land application. There are many
archive FSs around, but how feasible would it be to implement the
archive file support in the VFS at dentry-level? I'd be happy to share
my proposal.
