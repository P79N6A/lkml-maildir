Any reason you keep CardServices-compatibility-layer.patch around?
Having a compat layer for old driver around just for some architectures,
thus having drivers that only compile on some for no deeper reasons sounds
like an incredibly bad idea.  Especially when that API is not used by any
intree driver and only in -mm ;)
