 Hi all,
 I have 52X ATAPI/IDE internel cdrom dive. I am using
2.2.16 kernel. At the boot time I get the message:
  hdb: CDROM DRIVE 52X
 Then two lines later, i get the following message:
  hdb: 48X CD-ROM DRIVE w/128kb buffer
  Can someone tell me why am I getting these two
different messages?
 
  Thanks,
    Siddharth.
