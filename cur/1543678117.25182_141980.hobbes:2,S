The SiS chipset line can be quite confusing :
- the 730 was roughly a 735 with integrated video,
- the 740 is a pure northbridge with integrated video whereas the 745 
docs mention MuTIOL (usually a hint for separated north/south bridges) 
but the southbridge is still integrated and seems to be ATA100 like the 
735. I hope there isn't any 745 revision with different capabilities I'm 
not yet aware of...
I'll post a one liner this evening or a full patch if Alan and/or Linus 
didn't already patch their tree.
LB.
