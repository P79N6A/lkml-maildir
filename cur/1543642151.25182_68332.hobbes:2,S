Snipped code.
How do you know that 
 	up(&a->sem[enumerator]);
in the ISR and...
 	down_interruptible(&a->sem[enumerator]);
In axl_get_response...
	... have the same value of 'enumerator', therefore the same
semaphore?
One comes from a modulus and another from indirection off from 'board
address'?
I think there is a bug there.
