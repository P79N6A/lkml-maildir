   Actually, it isn't - it is deliberately 12 BLOCKS. True, this is 12k
   on a 1k block filesystem, but it is 48k on a 4k block filesystem. I'm
   not sure whether this was intentional or a bug in the mklost+found
   code.
It was deliberately chosen to be 12 blocks, but arguably 48k is more
space than is really necessary.  Probably not a disaster in the grand
scheme of things, but I will think about changing this in future
revisions of mke2fs.
