I also had that problem... I never fixed it, I just gave up, but what I
did notice was that any files inside the wblock size were copied fine, but
anything bigger than that was useless.  I just got a little bit of junk
data appended, and a bunch of error messages that I'd never seen before on
the FreeBSD server.  That was between 2.2.2 and FreeBSD 2.2.8, I believe.
I was using the userspace NFS daemons on the Linux side, 2.2beta37, stock
binaries from a RedHat 5.2 installation.
