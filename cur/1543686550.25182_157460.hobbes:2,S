Hi,
I just wanted to ask two question about the upcoming(?) 2.6.0 release
and BitKeeper. Just because I'm curious ...
1) Will 2.6.0 be a completly new import of an exported 2.5.XX release ?
2) Will 2.6.0 be _excactly_ identical to 2.5.XX ? With no additional
   changesets ?
Thanks,
Patrick
PS: I know it's (nearly) OT
