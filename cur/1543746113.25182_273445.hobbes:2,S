Oh yeah I've experienced that myself (and ever since, fear nested functions).
The compiler generates like "nested_function.0" for a nested function entitled
"nested_function". So far so good, but GDB does not now "nested_function.0",
even if it is a valid symbol according to `nm`. Sigh.

Not in C, at least. And neither in C++. (Only Perl if you ask, but that has
vastly different semantics for "($thing,$anoterthing)".)
I totally agree that some extensions are like superfluous. Some may say "nice
to have", but go make a survey and ask how many users use them. Bet zero on
the average? ;)
