I don't think it would make sense as a bitwise operator since the
right hand side thereof is the result of a != test. I would read that
as if it had been written as follows:
 Q> if ( (chrdevs[major].fops != 0) && (chrdevs[major].fops != fops) )
Note that naming an integer type variable as a condition is the same
as applying a test for non-zero to that variable, and naming a pointer
type variable is the same as applying a test for non-NULL.
Best wishes from Riley.
