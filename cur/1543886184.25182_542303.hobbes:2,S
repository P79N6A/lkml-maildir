arch/foo almost always supports a single compiler too - gcc. We simply
don't support anything else. We use gcc inlines and features extensively.
And who cares about such fine detail of C99, did they fix the struct copy
bug in ANSI C even ? [1]

[1] ANSI C says access to the padding fields of a struct is undefined.
ANSI C also says that struct assignment is a memcpy. Therefore struct
assignment in ANSI C is a violation of ANSI C...
At this point its a lot simpler not to care about other compilers pet
insanities or areas of the spec like volatile that are vaguer and less
credible than the output of the US congress.
