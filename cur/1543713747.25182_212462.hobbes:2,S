A correction: I can now suspend to ram and resume. But it seems that the
laptop is not in a good state after suspend to ram. I have let it in
this mode the whole day, and when I was back at home, the battery was
empty. :-(
I don't have use this laptop (or even another one) with another
configuration for suspending to ram, so I don't realy know how much time
we can have it in the suspend to ram state before the battery is empty.
But talking with one friend, he say that with 2.4 kernel and APM, this
will be many weeks.
I'm ready to help with the ACPI stuff if this may be usefull. Just let
me know what I can test.
Good day, and thanks for your help.
