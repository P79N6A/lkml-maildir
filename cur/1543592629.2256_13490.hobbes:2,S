I've also been having problems with 2.4.4 (and 2.4.4-ac10).
But my problems havn't been very easy to trigger as sometimes it happens
after a few hours and sometimes after 4 days.
I have a 8139A card.
The machine ran 2.4.2-ac6 for a long time without any problems, and then I
switched to 2.4.4 and it hung after 1 day. It was a silent deadlock, it
didn't print anything on the screen and it didn't respond to anything.
Then I switched to the 8139too driver from 2.4.2-ac6 to see if it's
stable. It has 2 days of uptime now so I'll have to wait some more until
I can say if it's stable or not.
