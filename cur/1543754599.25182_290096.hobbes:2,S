    That's irrelevant, the program I was trying to fix uses libusb.
My question is about the preferred kernel interface, 'cause I don't
know if it's the ioctl one or the URB one (well, I'm calling 'URB'
interface the API that is implemented using URB's inside the kernel).
    BTW, and judging from the program I've read, there are lots of
operations that must be done using 'usb_control_msg', and libusb
implements that function with exactly the same interface as the
kernel. The only difference is that libusb uses ioctl and the kernel
implements the function using URB's. IMHO libusb doesn't provide a
cleaner API, the only advantage of libusb is portability. Anyway,
I've not used it enough to judge, I'm more concerned about kernel USB
interface, not libusb one.
    Thanks anyway :)
