I thought (maybe I misunderstood) that Lomesh wanted to know
which kernel function (by name) is called for specific syscalls...
and strace will tell the syscall by name, but not the kernel
function names.
If Lomesh wants what I described, then the answer is more like
"see the syscall tables in each $ARCH".
