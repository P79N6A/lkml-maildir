FIWI, the explosion is related to the fact that I have two graphics
cards configured in.  One is on-board (Intel 865 Chipset), and the other
is an ATI X850 AGP (which I use, the other is there in case of failure).
If I disable all of the Intel 865 options, the box gets much further.
It then oopses while initializing sound, and eventually hangs.  I poked
SysRq-T while it was hung, and was looking at the serial console output
when it took off again.  It stalled again, and eventually, I gave up on
it.  The complete log up through me poking SysRq-T is available for the
asking if anyone is interested.
The oops is below, but is probably irrelevant for this thread.
