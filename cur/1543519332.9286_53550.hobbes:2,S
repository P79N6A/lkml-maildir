Ok.  As long as everyone else accepts it. What does the almighty penguin
say about this?
I REALLY need to know KNOW whether people accept me or not. I won't mind
being critised now, as long as complaints are laid out in a serious
manner. If any of you has anything on your minds that you don't want to
discuss openly on the list, feel free to reply privately.
(Oh, and what "other chunk of bugs" are you talking about?! If this chunk 
is very great, I might get cold feet...)

Well, that's rational, I can agree to that. Can't help that I'm a little
pedantic sometimes, I guess.
Then again, there are probably tons of ways to crash a v2.0.xx kernel that
won't get fixed. But this one has gotten quite some attention, that's why
I want it fixed. There are probably a few more such.
