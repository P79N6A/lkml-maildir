I've got a 2.0A GHz P4, advertised as non-hyperthread, that seems to be
reporting the presence of a second CPU. It also seems to be disabled by
setting bit 7 of its ID. I've tried compiling with support for 130 CPU's
and nothing changed. What would have to be done to get this disabled
CPU half back online?
