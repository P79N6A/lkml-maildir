This a key problem.  You do closed source development with public code
drops after many months.  That is not the Linux kernel way.  That is not
the Internet way.  The world now moves in Internet time.

Incorrect.  My patch was dropped shortly afterwards for a much better
version from Martin Mares.  (he describes these events in another
message in this thread)
Further, your months of CLOSED SOURCE work and testing produced buggy
code which completely ignores kernel infrastructure.
I notice you chose to completely ignore my bulletted list of bugs in
pci-netif.  You did not respond to this bug list, nor was pci-netif
ever updated on your web site.

Correct on the last point.  And re-read the thread:  I did not need
to have written any hot-swap drivers to be able to point out all the
MMIO-related deficiencies in your code.  Deficiencies which could
have easily been corrected had you PUBLICLY discussed your changes,
instead of doing closed source development.

The Linux kernel is incrementally developed.  That is how things work in
the open source world.  If you have a better design, you cannot simply
appear one day and say "mine is better, take it or leave it."

Did you ever stop and consider that implementing 2.3 drivers with a
backward compatibility layer for 2.2 and 2.0 kernels is more flexible,
and also easier to integrate into the mainline kernel?
Your approach of making 2.0 drivers work under newer kernels leads
to bugs because you do not work well with newer kernel infrastructure.

The Linux kernel user base is the largest test base in the world.  As
Linus has pointed out to you, the people who use the drivers from
your Web site are a self-selected test group.  If a Linus tree driver
works by default for a user, you never ever hear from them.
