Yes, I did, there were none.
I had one patch that required a fuzz factor, but it only has a vendor ID
definition in pci.h. It's the patch by Lukasz Trabinski, Subject "Re:
[patch] 2.2.18 PCI_DEVICE_ID_OXSEMI_16PCI954", Date 2000-12-16 19:51

That patch has been approved by Theodore Y Tso as being correct.
The other patches I applied did not leave any rejects behind.

It's at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/serial/
 and since these are down
ATM, I'm keeping a copy at
http://www-dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de/~ma/kernelpatches/v2.2/v2.2.18/
Procedure:
1. fetch 2.2.18-fix-serial-5.05-pre.patch (has also been posted here, it
   just adds a missing #define to pci.h)
2. fetch serial-5.05.tar.gz
3. patch the kernel with that 2.2.18-fix-serial-5.05-pre.patch, it takes
   a high fuzz factor (try patch -p1 -F10)
4. unpack serial-5.05
5. sh install-in-kernel
6. patch with VM-global-2.2.18pre25-7
7. make clean dep bzImage modules, install, boot, and see it hang.
Note my kernel also contains the IDE and I²C patches, should that
matter, if it matters, please tell the corresponding maintainer there's
an incompatibility.
For what it's worth, that www-dt server directory also has my config,
it's named config-ma2.
