Subject: [PATCH][fs/cifs/cifsfs.c] Make use of cifs_xquota_get
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Functions cifs_xquota_set and cifs_xquota_get at respectively
fs/cifs/cifsfs.c:367 and 392 are entirely similar - except for
whitespace
struct quotactl_ops contains function pointers .set_xquota and
.get_xquota that both get the address of cifs_xquota_set.
cifs_xquota_get isn't called anywhere else in the kernel.
The patch below makes use of the function cifs_xquota_get, As
an alternative the entire function cifs_xquota_get could be 
removed.
