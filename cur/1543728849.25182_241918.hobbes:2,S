Darren,
   I ran your test of "ls -laR of /etc >/dev/null" on our system and you
need to gen a kernel without himem and try it.  I get around .1 seconds
without himem and a whopping 4.45 with himem enabled.
I also tried without preemption and got the same results.  It is strictly
do to setting HIMEM in the kernel.
