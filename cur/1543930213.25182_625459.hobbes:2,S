I changed SYSFS_DEPRECATED to y, and it was able to boot with the same old
initrd I've been using for a while.
Note that I had it set to 'n' for at least the last 4-5 -mm kernels, so it
*was* working fine without it..

It was working fine with =n here until -rc4-mm1 as well, that's why it's a bit
of a surprise.  What got added to the 'deprecated' list in this iteration?
Now for the truly odd part - I just tried with a rebuilt initrd that included
the lvm.static from last night's Rawhide (lvm2-2.02.29-1.fc9).  And that didn't
work any better.
So to summarize: (old lvm == 2.02.24)
release	SYSFS_DEPRECATED	lvm2		works
-rc3-mm2		N	old	yes
-rc4-mm1		N	old	no
-rc4-mm1		Y	old	yes
-rc4-mm1		N	new	no
(I'm sure looking at that, everybody is now going 'WTF??!?' ;)
gregkh-driver-driver-core-fix-class-glue-dir-cleanup-logic.patch and
gregkh-driver-block-device.patch are the only patches left in the (very small)
bisect window that reference SYSFS_DEPRECATED at all (according to grep)
Anybody got any brilliant ideas? :)
