Now when you sent full backtrace - it looks to me like that fbdev
drivers are initialized before pci subsystem in -mm1. Unfortunately,
as proven by i2c, kobjects infrastructure does not like if you reference
non-existing bus type before it is registered. 
Can you try reverting _initcall changes? Although I see no reason
why it should matter, it is clear that pci subsystem is a bit unhappy.
Maybe it is caused by driver or device which is probed before fbdev?

P.S.: And what about change in drivers/pci/probe.c, which does
