	It won't be the first disagreement.  Debian actually was
poised to become *the* GNU distribution until they insisted on
carrying non-free software, when that was even more essential.  Every
so often this issue is raised again; presumably they will shed
non-free completely once a recent free version of Java 2, SWF player
and assorted stuff becomes available.
	What they *are* doing is removing the GNU FDL stuff.  I have
read the discussions, and it seems to me something they could get over
if RMS and some small group of Debian people -- *not* all of
debian-legal -- had a good talk over a good beer.
	OTOH all this never prevented Debian from being preferred by
the FSF, actually used by RMS, and from calling itself Debian
GNU/Linux, as well as being the Hurd distro.
