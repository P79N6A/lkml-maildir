I don't really like this port_tbl approach.  I think it complicates 
things too much.
Direct indexing should be fine.  For the non-linear case, just make sure 
the non-existent ports are always dummy ports.  If the driver directly 
references a port we know isn't there, that's just an AHCI bug to be 
fixed...
