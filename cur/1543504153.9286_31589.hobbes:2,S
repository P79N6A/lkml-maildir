While it is nce to have motorola *effectively* supporting linux
may I make the follwoing comments :
    1) The form you need to fill to access patches is quite
    painfull and if the purpose is only to notify users of
    patch changes, then email would be sufficient...
    2) The patch for 2.2.10 is 1.5 MB. It could have been 
    compressed!!!
Thanks for the work anyway...
