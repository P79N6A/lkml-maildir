I've just excluded it, with a comment to never _ever_ kill the machine 
unless there is a major reason for it.
We might want to add some "weaker" form of BUG_ON() for sanity checks that 
aren't life-threatening (ie a "CHECK(a == b)" kind of debug facility) that 
would be prettier than doing printk's and show_trace(), and that would 
also be easier to disable for production kernels (not that I personally 
much believe in disabling debugging like that - if it really isn't needed 
it should be removed, not disabled).
