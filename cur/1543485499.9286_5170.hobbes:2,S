The etherboot code has a very primitive DOS emulator which allows DOS packet 
drivers to be embedded into it's BIOS startup code. Any chance of doing a 
similar thing here, to load the DOS TSR during the Linux bootup sequence, and 
remove the need for DOS and loadlin?
Some BSDs, I believe, handle it differently - they can switch back to real
(vm86?) mode and call a VESA 1.2 BIOS directly.
