heh, a 128MB stripe?  that'd be huge :)

i actually tried this first :)  the problem then becomes a fork()
bottleneck before you run into the disk bottlenecks.  iirc the numbers
were ~45s for the 1-file-per-cat (for any -Pn, n<=10), ~30s for
100-files-per-cat (-P1) and ~1m15s for 100-files-per-cat (-P2).

one idea i had -- given that the server has a volume manager and you're
working from a snapshot volume anyhow (only sane way to do backups), it
might make a lot more sense to use userland ext2/3 libraries to read the
snapshot block device anyhow.  but this kind of makes me cringe :)
