Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Intelligible build process v0.02
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's v0.02 for those intrepid testers who want to see what their build is 
actually doing rather than watching a wall of mostly uninteresting text 
scroll by really fast.
With this script, you can actually spot the warnings.
The previous version got really confused by what "make dep" did in response 
to kernel module versions being switched on (but only after a fresh untar, or 
after running make mrproper).  I've now taught it more about the evils of 
make dep, so it's less confused, but I wouldn't call the cleaned up version 
of the output pretty...  (I'm not too worried: Kieth Owens' new build makes 
make dep go away completely.  I now know a lot more about why this is a good 
thing.)
Just throw the attached file in the scripts directory.  The script to test 
this still goes:
### Start of script
# "Entering directory" messages are just clutter in make dep
make dep | scripts/blueberry.py e
# This is short enough we don't need to see progress
echo "Cleaning out old temporary files."
echo " "
make clean > /dev/null
# Okay, build.
make bzImage | scripts/blueberry.py
make modules | scripts/blueberry.py
# make install/modules install require root access, not handling this yet.
### End of script
And it still requires python 2, but you cml2 testers should have no trouble 
with this. :)
I'm working on the curses frontend to replace the above script.  (The 
frontend is about  half the point of the exercise, cleaning up text mode is 
just a nice way to test it), but I've got paying work standing between me and 
that for a bit, so it'll be a few more days... :)
