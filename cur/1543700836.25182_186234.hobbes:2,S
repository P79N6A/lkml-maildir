	I had this problem with a RH9 install. Instead of modutils, upgrade the the 
latest module-init-tools from 
ftp://kernel.org
.
	The problem is that most of the module loading code has been moved from 
userspace to kernel code to make module loading more portable. Be sure to 
follow the upgrade instructions carefully. If done correctly it will keep 
your old modutils in case you load a 2.4.x kernel and will default to the new 
module-init-tools for 2.6.x kernels.
