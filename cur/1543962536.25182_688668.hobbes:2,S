Yeah, looking back at the code, I suppose by the time we've added the
new lease to the inode's lock list, we've already broken conflicting
leases.  OK.

I honestly don't understand how exactly Samba uses leases; it'd be
extremely useful to have a concise list of requirements from them.  I
know that they don't really meet the nfsv4 server's requirements (any
bugs aside).
