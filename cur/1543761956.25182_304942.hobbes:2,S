My case is simpler, as the application I attend it to is similar to a NAT. 
A packet comes in, a little alternation of the headers and off it goes 
again. So there's no TCP-stack or anything.
What I thought of doing, is map the skbuff to user-space. Have the 
user-application alter the headers. Send the (same) skbuff from 
kernel-space.
Does there exist anything equivalent?
