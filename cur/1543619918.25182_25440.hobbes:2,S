This is perhaps the part we it disagrees with our code.  I will
investigate this part.  The way we normally do things is have callbacks
per fd, that get called when our event occurs doing the read, or, write
directly.  We do check for the EWOULDBLOCK stuff and re-register the
event.  The thing we do not currently do is, attempt to read or write
unless we've received notification first.  This is what I am assuming is
breaking it.

Did that part too.
