Hello all,
I'm having a problem burning CDs. I ruined 3 cds (yeah, now I know '-dummy' 
:-/ and after checking dmesg, I see lots of these messages (or similar)
	ATAPI device hda:
	  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
	  Invalid field in parameter list -- (asc=0x26, ascq=0x00)
	  The failed "Mode Select 10" packet command was:
	  "55 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 3c 00 00 00 "
	hda: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
	hda: packet command error: error=0x50
	hda: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
	hda: packet command error: error=0x50
This is kernel 2.4.20 (actually gentoo-sources 2.4.20-r1 with ptrace patch.) 
I'm using glibc 2.3.2, cdrecord 2.0, xcdroast 0.98_alpha13. I'm not using 
ide-scsi.
hda: SAMSUNG CD-R/RW DRIVE SW-208F, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdb: Pioneer DVD-ROM ATAPIModel DVD-114 0124, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: QUANTUM FIREBALLP AS20.5, ATA DISK drive
hdd: ST330630A, ATA DISK drive
(full dmesg is attached.)
I know this drive works because I burned lots of CDs with it under Linux. The 
only thing I've changed is glibc (from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2) but I find it hard to 
believe it'd be the culprit; correct me if I'm wrong.
Someone suggested me to try a new ide cable, but it didn't make any 
difference.
Thanks in advance for any help,
Norberto
