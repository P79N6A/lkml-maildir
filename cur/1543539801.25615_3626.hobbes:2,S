Yep, in other word one of the the four flush_icache_range() calls can die.

I think the scenario only affects MIPS >= R4000 caches.  Assume a machine
under memory pressure.  It swaps the pages just loaded by the a.out loader
or the a.out ELF interpreter loader out even before flush_icache_range()
is called.  Next flush_icache_page() gets called and applies a cache
instruction to one of the swapped out pages.  Then the CPU will throw a
TLBL exception for which no exception handler exists, so fault.c will
panic with Unable to handle kernel paging request ...
I've fixed that in current set of MIPS cache patches.
