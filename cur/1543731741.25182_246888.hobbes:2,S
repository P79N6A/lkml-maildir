I think it should be up to the reader to request stuff, so I'd probably
just have the kernel notify the client that there won't be any more
differential updates. Then the client can decide what to do now.
But I'd have to play around with this to see what works.

The races left with nproc are much smaller. There is of course the question
of whether the pid still exists by the time you query the kernel about it.
But you get all the information in one go (although the process may still
disappear while the kernel prepares the requested info).

Entertaining, but you missed the point: I am not terribly impressed with
the fact that ps opens two files (stat, statm) for _every_ _single_
_process_ if all I want to know is, say, the name of PID 42 (example
taken from ps(1): ps -p 42 -o comm=).
And FWIW, you don't need the "minimum set of /proc files needed to
supply some required set of process attributes". Any set that supplies
the required fields will do, and you can get an excellent approximation
in O(n).
I suspect Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest would take exception with your
assertion that ps tools can't be improved. Or even that doing so is hard.
