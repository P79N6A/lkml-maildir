I'm pretty sure you want to do this.  The less work done in the drivers,
the better.  See Jeff's response on this as well.

I'm not sure what compatibility code you're referring to.  We need to
target older kernels with the same code base, so a simple
HAVE_ETHTOOL_OPS would make this easy.  I'd really like to move over to
ethtool_ops for e100/e1000/ixgb, but it's problematic if we need to
manage multiple code bases.
