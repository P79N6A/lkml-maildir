Hi,
I'm porting a driver on 2.4. , I've done the necessary to get him working,
but 
when I read the logs I found something like this after doing that :
insmod my_module
ifconfig up my_module
>my_module : received ioctl 35585
>/etc/hotplug/net.agent : register event not handled
Somebody know how ensure that the ioctl call come from net.agent ?
Am I obliged to handle the ioctl for compatibilty or something else ?
coud I just ignore it ?
I'm using redhat 7.1 kernel 2.4.2
Thanks
sebastien person
