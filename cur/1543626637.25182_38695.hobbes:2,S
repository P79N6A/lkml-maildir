As someone else has already responded.  Closed source standard so I'd guess
unlikely to become a true standard.  Seen many variations before and they've
all crashed and burned.  Whatever happened to the NorWEB field trial ?

More interesting could you hack into the protocol for reading the electricty
meter remotely ?  Spoof the meter and save a fortune in power bills!
Worked nextdoor to a remote meter company once and it was a problem they
took very seriously.
Still puzzled by the European political standardisation of the power supply.
Politics says 230V yet my AVO still reads 240V RMS in the UK and 220V in
Germany ?  Still it also says 50Hz and I'd swear I only get 49 and a glitch.
