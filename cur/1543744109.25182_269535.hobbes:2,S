OK, progress.  The oops is due to CONFIG_LEGACY_PTY_COUNT=512.  I assume
anything greater than 256 will trigger it.
- tty_register_driver() calls tty_register_device() for 512 devices.
- tty_register_device() calls pty_line_name() for the 512 devices, but
  pty_line_name() only understands 256 devices.  After that, it starts
  returning duplicated names.
- class_simple_device_add() gets an -EEXIST return from
  class_device_register() and then tries to kfree local variable s_dev, but
  it's already free.  Presumably all that icky refcounting under
  class_device_register() did this for us already.  Can you fix this one
  Greg?  Just enable slab debugging, set CONFIG_LEGACY_PTY_COUNT=512 and
  watch the fun.
As for the limitation of 256 legacy ptys: we should either raise it by
cooking up new device names or limit it to 256 in config.  The latter, I
guess.  Is there a requirement to support more than 256 legacy ptys?
Limit the number of legacy ptys to 256.  pty_line_name() isn't capable of
generating more than 256 unique names.
