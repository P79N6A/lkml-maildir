Ok, good to hear.

It's not known, no, and yeah, that's scary (and 60 seconds is long enough 
that most people would have grown bored and pushed the power button for 
five seconds, having considered the resume a failure).

Do you mean that doing "date" twice does not increase the seconds? If so, 
that's almost certainly related to the gaping delay. Which timer do you 
end up using (what does "dmesg | grep clocksource" say)? Does adding 
"clocksource=acpi_pm" to the kernel command line change things?
Also, what does your lspci look like?
