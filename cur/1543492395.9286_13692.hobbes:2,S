As I understand it, the 'hardware access' part of the driver consists
of it reading from or writing to specific IO ports or memory
addresses, and that much is already available...correct me if I'm
wrong here...

I would see that as being something like the following (which is a
pseudo-listing as they aren't set up here), which uses a range of
character device nodes that are currently unallocated, but other
node numbers would probably end up being allocated:
 Q> $ cd /dev
 Q> $ ls -lG modem wm*
 Q> lrwxrwxrwx   1 root            3 Mar  7  1998 modem -> wm0
 Q> crw-------   1 root       5,  32 May  5  1998 wm0
 Q> crw-------   1 root       5,  33 Apr  7 16:59 wm1
 Q> crw-------   1 root       5,  34 Apr  7 13:48 wm2
 Q> crw-------   1 root       5,  35 Apr  7 13:48 wm3
 Q> crw-------   1 root       5,  36 Apr  7 13:48 wm4
 Q> crw-------   1 root       5,  37 Apr  7 13:03 wm5
 Q> crw-------   1 root       5,  38 Apr  7 13:03 wm6

When the WinModem driver was started up, it would be told which wmX
device to hook itself into, defaulting to the first unused one, and it
would hook itself in from that.

I believe the required code already exists.

As far as the rest of the world is concerned, whether the modem is a
winmodem or a decent one should be totally transparent. For example,
referring to the above listing, minicom by default uses /dev/modem and
care's nothing whether that's a symlink to /dev/ttyS2 or /dev/wm0 as
it is above.
At worst, one would develop a libwinmodem library containing routines
common to most winmodem drivers, and the drivers would just be linked
against this library...

Nodz...
