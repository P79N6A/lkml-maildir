[ Changed the function name above.  It really isn't a lookup, it returns
a key, not a value.  My fault. ]
Looks correct otherwise.  Probably needs a comment that without "tmp" we
would skip a 0 key.  Or am I the only one who wants to simplify the code
before spotting this little subtlety?

Not sure what you mean.  Something with the same effect as this?
#define btree_for_each_val(head, geo, key, val)				\
	 for (key = btree_last(head, geo),				\
	 		val = btree_lookup(head, geo, key);		\
	 		val;						\
			key = btree_get_prev_key(head, geo, key),	\
			val = btree_lookup(head, geo, key))
