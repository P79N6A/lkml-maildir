We've been seeing an early boot hang on IBM x-series (at least on an
x440) with -rc6-mm1.  Finally got hold of a box to go search for this
and it seems that backing out the three patches below fixes it.
 515  dmi-move-acpi-boot-quirk.patch
 516  dmi-move-acpi-sleep-quirk.patch
 517  dmi-remove-central-blacklist.patch
I am pretty sure it is actually the first one (thats where my bisection
search pointed) but I had to drop the other two to back it out.  Anyhow,
2.6.12-rc6-mm1 boots on an x440 with these backed out.
Cheers.
