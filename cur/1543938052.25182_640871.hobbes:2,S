Well, it's a major pain in the a**. I've no idea, what reversed the order of 
PCI devices, but I had to disable the automatic dvb driver loading in order 
to get the picture back (dedicated vdr system with one FF and one budget 
card). I could have taken the route of exchanging the cards, but that would 
have been even more painful..
Oh well,
