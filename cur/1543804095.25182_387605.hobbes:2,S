I don't think it is quite irrelevant. Regardless of where it is used, it
doesn't hurt to make something smaller and more efficient.

dec_and_lock is not exactly a slow path. Maybe unrolling doesn't slow it
down in the traditional sense, but you're the one (rightly, I gather)
always talking about icache. In fact it unrolls an exceedingly rare second
iteration into the main code path.

fs/file_table.c uses it as well (inc_not_zero).
