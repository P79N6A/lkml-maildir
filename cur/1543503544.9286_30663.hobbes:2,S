I'd say this is probably something with your setup, or with the
cordless model specifically.  I have a Logitech wheelmouse (corded)
with P/N 811375 that has worked great with every 2.2 kernel I've tried
(2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.5, 2.2.6, and 2.2.10).
What specific vesion of kernel were you using?  Was it a "standard"
kernel or with distribution "tweaks?"  What's the part number for your
mouse?  How is it cordless?  Does it communicate with a device that
plugs into the standard mouse port, or does it use something funky like
an IR port?
