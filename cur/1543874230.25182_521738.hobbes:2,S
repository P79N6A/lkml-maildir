thanks for providing the data. Your ACPI tables don't provide
information about the power states (C-States), but your BIOS seems to
switch the CPUs into deeper power states, when it runs on battery. In
those deeper power states the local APIC timers and the TSC are stopped.
So the machine waits for ever on the next timer interrupt.
We have a broadcast mechanism for this, which gets activated from ACPI,
but the broadcast mechanism is not activated:
[    3.798000] Clock Event Device: pit
....
[    3.798000] tick_broadcast_mask: 00000000
Can you please boot with 2.6.20 or earlier and check the output
of /proc/interrupts ?
IRQ#0 and the LOC (local APIC timer) Interrupts should increment in the
same frequency.
