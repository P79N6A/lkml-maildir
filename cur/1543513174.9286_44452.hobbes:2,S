A friend of mine has a machine which is being used for certain
numerical problems. The system has 512 MB RAM and another 1.5
Gig of RAM. The memory objects in use are usually contiguous
chunks of memory sized between 2 and 20 MB, which are normally
accessed in a sequential manner.
Benchmarking the harddisk area which is being used for swap, he
can get sustained write rates of 26 MB/sec under Windows NT
4.0SP5 as well as under Linux 2.2.12. Swapping a gigabyte of
data takes 6 min under NT and 11 min under Linux, resulting in a
data rate of 6 MB/sec under NT and 3 MB/sec under Linux. During
paging operations heavy seeking is audible.
The questions are:
1. Why is this so slow compared to the benchmarked data rate?
2. What tools are available under Linux to determine the reason
   for the paging activity (i.e. are these only accesses for the
   desired memory objects or are we observing some strange
   interference between multiple processes?) or to show how
   memory objects map to swap area data blocks? Or, formulated
   more abstract, what tools are available to debug such
   problems?
3. Are there any system calls available which can be utilized to
   advise the system that a certain area of memory will always
   be accessed as a contigous chunk of memory that should be
   grouped contigously in a swap area if possible and to advise
   the system that all memory accesses to this area will be
   sequential/sequential backward/random so that the system can
   optimize its memory access strategy. Where would one search
   for documentation on such system calls?
