Yes you are right, I check for amperage < 0 first and then for 
amperage < 100. It should of course be amperage < -100 and is meant for
the case where one is on AC, battery was fully charged and which is now
slightly decharging by less than 100mA/min leading to a remaining time
being displayed of more than 700 hours left.
/proc/apm output with that patch (but wrong check amperage < 100):
0.5 1.1 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x01 99% 92276 min
/proc/apm output with new patch:
0.5 1.1 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x01 99% 0 min
This is the /proc/pmu/battery_0 equivalent.
flags      : 00000011
charge     : 3130
max_charge : 3148
current    : -2
voltage    : 16629
time rem.  : 5634000
Well it is a special case to be dealt with... one could aswell change
the flags from 'high battery' status to 'charging' or return -1 as the
remaining time... However the battery is fully charged but as the system
is on AC it is simply idling messing up the remaining time.

actually that is dealt with already as there is a check for both
amperage < 0 and for amperage > 0.
