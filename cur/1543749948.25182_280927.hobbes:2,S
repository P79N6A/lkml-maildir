On ppc64 we avoid having to zero newly-allocated page table pages by
using a slab cache for them, with a constructor function that zeroes
them.  Page table pages naturally end up being full of zeroes when
they are freed, since ptep_get_and_clear, pmd_clear or pgd_clear has
been used on every non-zero entry by that stage.  Thus there is no
extra work required either when allocating them or freeing them.
I don't see any point in your patches for systems which don't have
some magic hardware for zeroing pages.  Your patch seems like a lot of
extra code that only benefits a very small number of machines.
Paul.
