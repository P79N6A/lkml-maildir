Stupid task.  If task wants to run on -all- cpus on a
hotplug system, task should not pass a saved mask, but
rather construct a mask with all bits set and pass that:
  cpu_set_t mask;
  unsigned int i;
  /* set all bits in mask - code totally untested */
  for (i = 0; i < sizeof(cpu_set_t) / sizeof (__cpu_mask); i++)
    mask.__bits[i] = ~0;
  sched_setaffinity(&mask);
Similar problems exist for a task running in a cpuset under
migration.  Saved masks are useless in all but static systems,
having no migration, no hotplug.
That, or use a library on top of this that lets the task work
with relative (to whatever is available) CPU and (for the
mbind/mempolicy calls) Memory Node numbers and that handles
the above details.  If all goes well, I should be releasing
such a library in the not distant future.
