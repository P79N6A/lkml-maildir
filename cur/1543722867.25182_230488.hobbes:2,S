I was wondering if not.  I didn't notice any problems while using it 
once it had booted, but then I didn't really try to stress it much 
either.  I'm running gentoo and have RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP="yes" set in my 
/etc/conf.d/rc, maybe that's what makes me hit this during init whereas 
I haven't seen anyone else mention this.
