All wonderful. However, it dosn't fix the problem. You are,
again, assuming that the problem is the symptom! The problem
is that some piece of code is not handling an exception
properly. It is waiting forever for something that will
never happen. It's that CODE that needs to be fixed.
"Cleaning" up the immediate symptoms doesn't let
the next thread that acquires the "cleaned up" lock
use the hardware because it has jammed code between
that thread and the hardware.
The bad code needs to be fixed. If the bad code is
fixed, you will __never__ have a process stuck
in 'D' state unless you run for the 1000 years
that could statistically result in a bit in
the semaphore getting flipped.
