So I tried something new. I enabled the SCSI error reporting and now get 
this:
FAILED
   status = 1, message = 00, host = 0, driver = 08
   Current sd: sense key Illegal Request
Additional sense: Invalid command operation code
FAILED
   status = 1, message = 00, host = 0, driver = 08
   Current sd: sense key Illegal Request
Additional sense: Invalid command operation code
I found another interesting thing: It seems those errors only appear 
when I use mozilla thunderbird! Any idea what tb is trying to do to the 
hd? As I said earlier kernels didn't report such errors. (Are those 
actually errors?)
