In EVERY case where your non-overcommit system operates correctly, my
overcommitted machine does too.
Under heavier load, there is a point where my system continues to
operate correctly but yours fails with OOM errors.
Finally, we reach a heavy overload situation, where both systems fail
with OOM errors.
Explain why you believe causing the second situation to fail
unnecessarily is an improvement.

Yes, we KNOW you want user resource quotas. You can't have them yet,
so stop talking about them - they are irrelevant here.
