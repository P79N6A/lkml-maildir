I installed pthread libaries recently, anyhow, I keep getting errors what I cannot work around with gcc and make in general. I cannot even compile a new gcc to allow for the new pthread extenstion. I uninstalled pthread libs in hopes to restore prior state but umm yah. After reinstalling::
Current Kernel:2.4.20
Current GCC:2.95.3
Current Pthread:1.4.1
This was the error I got when building commoncpp-2-1.0.9, but this error is similar in everything else I try to build.
::Configure options::::
./configure  --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --with-pthread --with-ftp
