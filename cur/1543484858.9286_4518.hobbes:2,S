Of course :-)

Where I said that rename() change was done to screw modules up ? It's just
side effect :-))

Uh ? How you could make filesystem modules without dependency on VFS ???

Correct.

Yes. And when next tarball will be made most of them will be fixed already.
At least important ones. With add-ons it's always catch-up :-((

Interfaces changes sometimes. In case of Linux kernel interfaces changes
more often then anywhere alse (hm... may be interfaces in GNOME are changes
even faster sometimes :-) since binary compatibility are not goal of prime
developers (Linus and Alan at least :-)... With tarball it's not so big
problem: you always can recompile modules when switching to new kernels...
With splitted kernel this will become much bigger problem (when you download
new tarball it's not so strange that you should recompile your NTFS module;
if NTFS module will be separate package this will become FAQ #1:
  "Why after upgrading kernel from 2.2.5 to 2.2.8 I'm no longer could access
my Ethernet card and NTFS partiton is not mountable" ?
since users are used to binary-only Windows modules nowadays where you could
use old drivers after applaing service pack or hotfix :-))
