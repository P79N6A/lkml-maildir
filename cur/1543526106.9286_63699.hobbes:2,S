It should be fairly clear from my original message. The executive
summary:
She's conducted a pointless argument (it turns out she's done pretty
much the same thing as Larry suggested, yet she came out ridiculing
the idea at the start). And she's cast aspersions on people's
knowledge, competence and maturity (the "ego" comment). So her conduct
in this debate has been inappropriate in this public forum.
Her PC manifesto is a separate issue, although it is
hypocritical^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hironic given her subsequent
conduct. It does take the wind out of the sails of her PC manifesto.
