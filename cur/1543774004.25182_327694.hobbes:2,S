Yes.

I don't know any.  But with 'sudo' the potential set of SUID apps is
basically infinite, so you'd have a hard time proving that this sort
of situation won't arise.

Another theoretical possibility is that you make the SUID app consume
some resource by feeding it a large-file/deep-directory/etc that quota
would otherwise prevent (you can't do quota on a synthetic filesystem,
without the filesystem's cooperation).
