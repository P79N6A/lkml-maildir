Hi,
Since we use 2.4.23 we have lot of crash. I have no kernel panic.
All I can report is this kind of syslog's message:
__alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x1d2/0)
VM: killing process rateup
Mysql doesn't like 2.4.23 either.
SQL Error : 1 Can't create/write to file '/tmp/#sql2ec_1acd2_2.MYI' (Errcode: 30)
It arrives on servers which need swap.
No problem with 2.4.22.
Thanks
Octave
