i_dir_acl is for directories only, whereas
i_size_high is for other inodes, thus you cannot have +4GB directories (and
you generally don't even want that, even with btrees), otherwise you can
well have acls and +4GB files at the same time. See discussion on this topic
on l-k several months ago.
This is the same as it there was a union...
I hope ACL will make it into 2.3, as well as journalling, btrees, so IMHO
you don't need to start thinking about ext3, ext2 is extensible enough to
cope with that. There is even space for 32bit uid/gids and large devices,
AFAIK.
Cheers,
