I don't have any good numbers, although it is enough that you can
measure the difference.  I think Roland Drier and the other IB
guys have actually made the measurements.  For low-end hardware
I expect the performance difference is currently in the noise.
However because MSI irqs are not shared a lot of things are
simplified.  In particular it means that you should be able to have an
irq fastpath that does not read the hardware at all, and hardware
register reads can be comparatively very slow.
Further because all MSI irq are not shared and edge triggered we don't
have a danger of screaming irqs or drivers not handling a shared
irq properly.
The big performance win is most likely to be for fast I/O devices
where the multiple IRQs per card will allow the irqs for different
flows of data to be directed to different cpus.
So for the short term I don't think there is much downside in having
MSI disabled.  For the long term I think MSI will be quite useful.
Further my gut feel is that my two patches together will enable MSI on
most of the x86 chipsets where it currently works.  Because most
chipsets are either from Intel or are hypertransport based.
