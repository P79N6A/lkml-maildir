Hi there.
I have one machine which Oops's when I try to install RedHat 5.2 from
the CD. It gets as far as the "Welcome to RedHat" screen (the one with
the single OK button on it), and as soon as one presses the said OK
button, it displays an Oops over the screen...
Because of the colours at that time, it gets displayed as red text on
an almost identical red background, thus being VERY hard to read, and
as I don't have any symbol tables for it (it's the kernel in the
boot.img file), I can't decode it anyway, so if anybody can give me
any clues as to what I should be doing next, it'd be appreciated...
Basic system info: AMD K6-2/350, 128M RAM, 512k cache, S3-ViRGE/DX
video with 4M video ram, anything else needed just ask...
Best wishes from Riley.
