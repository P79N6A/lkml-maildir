    Stupid things like overheating. wrong voltages can also trigger it
Is there any reason why, with proper MCE checking for both K7 and PIII
we can't automatically off-line processors when they start doing bad
things?
Sure, its a pretty lousy thing to do, but if you buys you a few
minutes and allows userland to initiate some kind of remedy
(pager("HELP"); system("shutdown"); sort of thing)...
Also, I'm pretty sure I was seeing overheating problems or something
on a K7 at one point, but never saw MCE; I take it this code only
exists fully in -ac kernels? I looked in Linus' tree and couldn't see
anything.
