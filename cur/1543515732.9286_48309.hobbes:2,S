I agree with both you and Alan.  Here is a possible solution:  Instead of
compiling a list of problematic hardware, which will be resource intense, why
not compile a list of working hardware.  This is a much safer alternative, as
the kernel/initscripts would have an iron-clad set of rules.  If you go the
other route, someone is going to have hardware that is not on the "problematic"
list and get themselves locked or corrupted.
You can tell alot about a person by their choice of hardware :).  The person
that cares enough to pay an extra few dollars for quality hardware is usually
the same person that would care about proper tuning of said hardware.

Exactly, which would work well with the "known to work" list.

I'd much rather see a message like that than an Oops or Aieeee. :)
