    I've had this problem with 2.1.1xx kernels, but I've not yet tried
it on pre-2.2.0 kernels. The problem I saw was that modules.dep was
zero bytes long, strace showed traversing of directories, but not
stat'ing the files in the modules directories.
    I posted the problem here, but no one else seemed to have hit it.
I'll have another play with it in about 4 weeks time, see if it's the
same.
Regards
Sid.
