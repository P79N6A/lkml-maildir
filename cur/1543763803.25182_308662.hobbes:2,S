Adam,
We need to coordinate your work with the PCI Express Port bus driver
that was accepted into the 2.6.x kernel.  The PCI Express Port Bus
driver claims all PCI-PCI Bridge's which implements PCI Express
Capability Structure. Please refer to PCIEBUS-HOWTO.txt for why we
developed PCI Express Port Bus driver to support PCI Express features.
Your current patch will claim PCI Express root ports, preventing the PCI
Express Port bus driver from loading.   Given the many advanced features
of PCI Express a separate bus driver was required.   Can you change the
patch so it only loads on standard PCI bridges and not PCI Express
devices?
Thanks,
Long
