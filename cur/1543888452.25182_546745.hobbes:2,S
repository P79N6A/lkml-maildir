I also though of using LZO compression for some of the diskless nodes
which use iSCSI over 100 Mbit or slower.
Certainly, a fast de/compression algorithm in the kernel could bring
some new, innovative uses:
- there are talks about compressed filesystems (jffs2, reiser4, LogFS) -
why no one thought about a compressed tmpfs (should be way easier than a
compressed on-disk filesystem, as we don't have to care about data
recovery in event of a failure)?
- using compression for networking (like Bill mentioned)
- compressed caching
- compressed suspend-to-disk images (should suspend/restore faster this way)
