A maintenance update, as usual:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-8.tar.gz
Fixes another CONFIG_BOOTIMG_SMP problem (configuration only - if it
compiled, it was okay), and brings ELF loading efficiency back on
track. Besides that, there's only minor cleanup, plus the addition
of man pages for bootimg(2) and bootimg(8).
The patch is still for 2.3.48, but should work for .49 and .50 too.
Unfortunately, I still haven't gotten hold of that "missing interrupts"
bug - whenever I think I can reproduce it, it vanishes on the next
reboot and doesn't come back for two or three days :-(
Also, no initrd address selection improvements. But I hear that initrd
is okay in .50, so I'll give it a try soon.
- Werner, ghost-busting ...
