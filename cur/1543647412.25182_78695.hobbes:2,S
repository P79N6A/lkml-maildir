It does. When using syn cookies you cant use some of the new advanced
features of tcp. Linux uses the backlog queue when not under attack.
When the queue overflows it just uses cookies - but can still accept
connections.

I don't think these statements are entirely true. While it is true that
you can't use things like window scaling or SACK - syncookies 100%
successfully stop syn flood attacks.
The attack is that if you fill the syn backlog queue with bogus requests
then legitimate clients can no longer connect. The syn flood attack
isn't "your legitimate connections wont be able to use window scaling".
