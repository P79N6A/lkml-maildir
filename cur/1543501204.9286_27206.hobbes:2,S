	(This is a FAQ with e.g. Oracle setup at Linux..)
	Size of the SysV SHM is runtime controlled by writing to:
		/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
	# echo "55000000" > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
	Now your maximum SHM size is 55 million bytes (you get the idea ?)
	There are some limits at how high you can push that, but they
	are pretty high...  At least 512 MB is possible at SysV SHM.
