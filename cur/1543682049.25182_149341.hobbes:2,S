Alan/Eran,
Thanks for your TIPS - I'm thinking that it is the memory being the problem.
I download and run memtest86 v3 and I have many errors (25-35) when it run test #3 
and test #4 (I'm just memtest86 without any configuration).
Given that this is the 2nd (different) type of memory Ive tried - I'll get my 
supplier to give me something else and hopefully that'll fix the Ooopss..
Thanks for your tips!
