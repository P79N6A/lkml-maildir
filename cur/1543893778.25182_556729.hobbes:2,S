Growing the FS is just either extending or adding a new extent tree.
Shrinking is more complex.  The extent trees do have back pointers to
the objectids that own the extent, but snapshotting makes that a little
non-deterministic.  The good news is there are no fixed locations for
any of the metadata.  So it is at least possible to shrink and pop out
arbitrary chunks.

So far, I'm not planning quotas beyond the subvolume level.

HSM in general is definitely interesting.  I'm afraid it is a long ways
off, but it could be integrated into the scrubber that wanders the trees
in the background.
