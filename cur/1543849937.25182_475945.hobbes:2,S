The if test appears to be redundant as kfree(NULL) is a valid no-op.

Many users will misconstrue this has a hard disk name - is there a
better name to use.

These all really show that we should pass the name into the misc
register and do the printk there to cut down on random name variants and
kernel size. Separate problem, just noting it in case someone feels
inspired 8)
