One more thing I forgot to mention is that if I use that hard 80-pin
cable, then I do not get such errors at boot time, but get them when
some service is loading, and if I use the cheaper more flexible
cable(with possibly lesser number of cables), then I get these errors
while the kernel is loading as well as when some service is loading.
That service is smartd.
Again, only in 2.4.20-8, in the previous version(the default that came
with RedHat-7.2), there is no such problem. Also, I use a re-compiled
version of the 2.4.20-8 kernel, whereas the default RedHat provided one
for 7.2, but the errors persist even for the default RedHat-9 kernel
2.4.20-8, so I suspect that it's a kernel thing.
One more thing! In RedHat-9 with 2.4.20-8, sometimes, the number of
processes just increases like mad! and the whole system becomes
unstable. Then I get errors like I/O error, and hda can not be read
from, and a whole list of blocks.
