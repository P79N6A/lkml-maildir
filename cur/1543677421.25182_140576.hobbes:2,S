It stops code from using software scrollback, which is common for both
heads, and which can corrupt memory if screen size on both /dev/fb* differs.
Maybe it wont help, but scrollback is known problem, so lets rule this

I'll try to build some 2.4.x kernel on monday, but I assume that I would
notice such reboot during regular usage of dualhead system, as in the past
I was using 2.4.x...
