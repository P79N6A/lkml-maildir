  If you think that one test under one set of conditions proves that
user tuning is worthless, then remove OOM, as I can prove there are
cases where things work as well without it.
  To be honest I don't think that running a single player process while
running memory tests is representative of typical usage. Someone on a
small memory machine with memory pressure spread over multiple processes
would be better, and sudden program growth is also a reasonable thing to
expect, such as opening large files in an editor, entering a busy
newsgroup for the first time, opening a large image with gimp, etc.
These loads are things which users commonly do, and tuning parameters
for better responsiveness is certainly as valuable as running a test
with a numeric output. Sluggish system is one thing I do notice with
most Linux kernels on memory challenged machines.
  I think it would be worth waiting for a bit of additional feedback on
"feel" would be useful before adopting the Windows "system knows best"
approach.

  His first management concern is not solving the problem, but covering
his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
