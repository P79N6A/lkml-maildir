I've found that with the combination of process affinity and irq affinity you
can get very good interrupt latency/determinism. We use a pci card that has
some external interrupts and some 250ns resolution timers and have found the
interrupt latency/determinism of the external interrupts to be more than 
exceptable as long as the process and irq of that pci card are forced
to one cpu and ALL other processes/irq's are forced to another cpu. Of coarse
you need an SMP box for best results. We found that with a UMP box you can
get the latency but there is no determinism to that latency.
