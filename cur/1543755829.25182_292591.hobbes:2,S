The dcbz instruction on the G5 (PPC970) establishes the new cache line
in the L2 cache and doesn't disturb the L1 cache (except to invalidate
the line in the L1 data cache if it is present there).  The L2 cache
is 512kB and 8-way set associative (LRU).  So zeroing a page is
unlikely to disturb the cache lines that the page fault handler is
using.  Then, when the page fault handler returns to the user program,
any cache lines that the program wants to touch are available in 12
cycles (L2 hit latency) instead of 200 - 300 (memory access latency).

But that also disturbs cache lines that may well otherwise be useful.

As has my scepticism about pre-zeroing actually providing any benefit
on ppc64.  Nevertheless, the only definitive answer is to actually
measure the performance both ways.
