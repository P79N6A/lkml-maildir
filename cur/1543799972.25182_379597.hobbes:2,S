    Because free memory is a *waste* of memory. Why leaving unused
memory when it can be used for caching? The kernel will (up to some
extent, I suppose) try to use all free memory for caching if no app
needs it.
    If you have 8GB of memory, it's a bit difficult to fill it just
with the running apps, so the kernel cleverly uses the rest for
caching things so the system runs faster.
    For example, I have 1GB of RAM, and even when I use X (seldom...)
I never eat up more than, let's say, 500MB. So, I have another 500MB
of memory unused: the kernel uses it as cache, and that makes my
system run much faster (I noticed a speed increase when I switch from
512 to 1G).
