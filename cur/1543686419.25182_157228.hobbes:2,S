Microbenchmarks are useless for this. You have to bench the users too,
otherwise you don't recognize the additional cache misses.

Possible. In my experience the best copy functions vary widly between
different steppings. Just optimizing for a single one is probably
not a good idea, especially not for an very old one 
(except when you add dynamic patches for the different steppings, but
then it quickly gets ugly with too many variants)
When in doubt use the more simple function.
