Good spotting... can you try something slightly different?
In speedo_start_xmit, make the logic look this like...
	...
	if (tx_full_condition)
		netif_stop_queue(dev)
	...
That should be the _only_ start or stop queue in speedo_start_xmit.
In order for this change to be complete, you need to go over the
spinlocking to make sure it protects stuff (mainly stuff on the transmit
side), and also make sure the interrupt handlers looks like this...
	if (! tx_full_condition)
		netif_wake_queue (dev)
ie. no netif_stop_queue calls in the interrupt handler.
