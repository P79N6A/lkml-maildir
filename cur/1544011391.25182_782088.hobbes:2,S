Just to make sure I understand it correctly, the slab_free() fast path
stores the pointer to the freed object into c->freelist. However, this
object is no longer tracked by kmemleak because of the
kmemleak_free_recursive() call at the beginning of this function (false
negatives make sense only for allocated objects).
On the slab_alloc() fast path, the pointer to an allocated object is
obtained from the c->freelist pointer but this seems to be overridden by
the pointer to the next free object, object[c->offset], which isn't yet
tracked by kmemleak. So, during a memory scan, it shouldn't matter that
the kmem_cache_cpu structures are called as they don't contain any
pointer to an allocated (not free) object.
The new slabs are allocated with alloc_pages() and these are not tracked
by kmemleak.
Is my understanding correct? Thanks.
