OK, I have been busy with other things, so haven't been able to test as
much.  There might be a few regressions with S7.  Here is a trace from
the ext3 journaling code that I never saw before.  It starts with some
printks from the rtc_interrupt, due to having the rtc-debug patch
installed, but these accout for less than 100 usecs of the ~600 usec
latency.
