I meant it as a plural "you" mainly refering to Christoph, who did use
those words, and not too sparingly either :)
I did not mean it personally, please accept my apologies.

But I'd want to continue distribute the non-crippled kernel module
too, with suid fusermount.  Then fusermount _has_ to know which kernel
module is currently active.

Every opinion counts.
I'm not trying to convince people that the current solution is
perfect.  What I'm saying that it's
  a) not harmful
  b) it makes non-privileged mounts possible
And b) is _the_ most important feature IMO, so the argument for
stripping it out has to be very good.
Thanks,
Miklos
