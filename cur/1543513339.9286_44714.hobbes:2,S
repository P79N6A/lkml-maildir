Hi,
    Okay, I finally got a chance to get a recent 2.3 kernel to boot
(almost) on my Miata past the PCI probing stuff.  Unfortunately, all of
my disks hang off of two QLogic ISP1040B adapters (aka KZPBA-CAs for you
DECies/PAQies).  So...with 2.3.22, I get some mention about
"qlogicisp : unable to decode i/o address 0x8100" for one, and the same
just with 0x8200 for the other.
If I go back to my 2.2.12 kernel, I see base addresses of 0x9000 and
0x9800 respectively.  I went to check the data that the io_base was
pointing to (which was what caused the query to fail) and got back
0xffff for what should have been either the PCI_VENDOR_ID_QLOGIC or the
PCI_DEVICE_ID_QLOGIC_ISP1020.  Needless to say, that's not quite the
right answer.  So, I changed DEBUG_CONFIG to 1 in drivers/pci/setup.c
and got the following for a boot log.  The rest of the boot log
disappeared after the serial init, but the end result is the same.  I
can hand copy one if someone would like.Anyone have any idea what
happened here, or a better way to continue debugging this?  Thanks!
 - Pete
P.S.  Sorry for the long log at the end...
