One long-standing problem is DM/LVM. That -may- be fixed now, but I
suspect issues remain.

That'd be handled in the usual way by switch_to_new_stack. That is,
we'd store the location of the old stack at the top of the new stack
and then literally change everything to point to the new stack.

It's not any ickier than explicitly calling schedule().

Maybe.
