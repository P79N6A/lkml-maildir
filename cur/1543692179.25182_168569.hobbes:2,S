I'm thinking now that 2.4.21 had right:
CONFIG_ACPI == ACPI
!CONFIG_ACPI == !ACPI
No special config option to include/exclude HT.
Internally, the table parsing code will be included if (CONFIG_SMP ||
CONFIG_ACPI) -- since that code doesn't even know about HT, it just
knows about parsing ACPI tables and enumerating processors etc.  This
makes sense as this code is needed, for example, by an SMP system that
doesn't implement HT, and also by uni-processor ACPI-enabled systems. 
Inventing an "HT-something" config option to describe this code was
probably a mistake.
So at the config option level, we'll be compatible with 2.4.21.  Under
the covers we'll be different as 2.4.21 erroneously made acpitables
depend on the IOAPIC -- which didn't support HT on IO-APIC-less boxes
(eg the volume P4 desktops we see today).
thanks,

ps. Thanks for emphasizsing the "config selects a feature concept".  I
really do agree.  Indeed, I implemented it this summer, but I got hung
up on the fact that when I was done, in the CONFIG_ACPI case, CONFIG_HT
== !CONFIG_HT so I discarded that scheme.
