Comedy. So the story so far..
- ATI grab 2.4.16's AGP driver.
- Working AGP3 support happens in 2.5
- ATI gets backported to 2.4 and 'munged'.
- Additional fixes go into 2.5
- ATI forwardport their trainwreck to 2.6.
It shouldn't have *any* need whatsoever to touch agpgart in 2.6.
The mind truly boggles.
