Looks like you've got a different animal. What I had was the breakage in
add_to_swap_cache() - it tired to add page into the inode queue of phoney
inode. Which didn't have initialized i_pages. Back when it was a simple
list we managed to get out with that, but now it's a cyclic list and
{NULL, NULL} doesn't work. Could you try the following:
--- mm/filemap.c.old	Tue Oct 19 17:02:12 1999
+++ mm/filemap.c	Thu Oct 21 16:09:20 1999
@@ -539,6 +539,8 @@
 	page = page_cache_alloc();
 	if (!page)
 		return;
+	if (page->buffers)
+		PAGE_BUG(page);
 
 	if (!add_to_page_cache_unique(page, inode, offset, hash)) {
 		inode->i_op->readpage(file, page);
and see if it will barf in a different place? From the stack trace you've
posted it looks like somewhere along the way we manage to get
->buffers!=NULL on fresh page...
