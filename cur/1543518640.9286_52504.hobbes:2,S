Thanks for the advices to all of you who replied :-)  I will try some
(of course, after verifying them with a doctor, now it's the first
time I regret not going to a medical school :-))...

Well, I am coding right now.  I made some significant improvments to
the latest version I sent - so please wait for the next patch if you
are going to put it in the kernel - in a day or two - this time I want
to test it more thoroughly so I can really say it's final.
After that, if kbd soft repeat _really_ makes sense, I can start to
think about it and then implement it...  Linus?
