And often we can provide a boot param or whatever, that makes it at
least useable.

But we cannot (copy all windows (mis-)behavior).

For Adrian it would be enough to be able to lower them.
Also being able to define a passive trip point (even if not provided by
BIOS) could help a lot machines.
What about at least:
  - Be able to override passive cooling trip point
  - If BIOS does not provide one, let user be able to define it
This should already make a lot people happy.
