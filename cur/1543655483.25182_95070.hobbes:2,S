2.4.21pre1 has updated IDE core code so it probably wants a bit of a
resync before it can go in. The 2.5.50 one is matching the 2.4.21pre1
IDE core so it shouldnt be too bad.
The one current difference is that 2.5.50 has ->vdma on devices which if
set indicates you should set up as if for DMA but issue PIO commands.
Its used for controllers that support DMA for PIO mode transfers
