It seems to be caused by the incompatibilities with I2C 2.8.0:
"ADDITIONALLY, i2c-2.8.0 is not API compatible to earlier i2c
releases due to struct changes; therefore you must NOT ENABLE
any other i2c drivers (e.g. bttv) in the kernel.  Do NOT use
lm-sensors 2.8.0 or i2c-2.8.0 if you require bttv."
