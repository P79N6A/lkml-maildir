Wrong.  The existing implementation is racy as hell.  There is NO
locking on the existing chains, these patches make the notifier chains
race free.
Some of the notifier callbacks are used in weird contexts, including
NMI, so the only option for those chains is RCU.  Obviously those
callbacks cannot sleep.  Other chains are used in more normal context
_AND_ the callbacks want to sleep, so those chains need to use sleeping
locks.
