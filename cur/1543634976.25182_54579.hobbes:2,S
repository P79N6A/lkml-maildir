Right --- sync only guarantees that the writes have started; you're
not safe until the disk light is off.
The VFS kernel core syncs each filesystem sequentially during sync and
bdflush.  If we do each one synchronously, we end up serialising IO
and performance with multiple disks goes _way_ down.  However, you can
choose synchronous completion of ext3_write_super() by giving modular
ext3 the module option "do_sync_supers=1".
