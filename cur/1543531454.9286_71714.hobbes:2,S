	The MTA.  Except at VGER there is special static
	routing rule asked from Demon folks for dumping
	there all  *.demon.co.uk  subdomains.  That static
	route puts them all to punt-2.mail.demon.net.
	At VGER's lists there are currently 455 recipients
	which are at various (sub)domains under  demon.co.uk.
	This method makes them transported from VGER in one
	SMTP transaction per message instead of 46 separate
	(for linux-kernel list, other lists have other counts..)
