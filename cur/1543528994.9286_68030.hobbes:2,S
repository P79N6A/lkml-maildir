You've lost at least one entry from the config list:
   if [ "$CONFIG_ARM" = "y" ]; then
      if [ "$CONFIG_ARCH_ACORN" != "y" ]; then
         tristate '  AM79C961A support' CONFIG_ARM_AM79C961A
      else
         source drivers/acorn/net/Config.in
      fi
   fi
and oops, you've just removed the only way for one ARM architecture to
do anything useful (diskless machine).  This driver doesn't really come
under the classification of "ISA" because the bus it's connected to is
not ISA, but more the raw system bus.
I think you need a "miscellaneous" section. ;)

ARM doesn't have MCA, but may have ISA and PCI buses depending on the ARM
architecture selected.
