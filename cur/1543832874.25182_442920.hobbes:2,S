The exec'd application may return regular error codes, which would 
interfere. IIRC /usr/sbin/useradd has different exit codes depending on 
what failed (providing some option, failure to create account, failure to 
create home dir, etc.). Now if you exit(errno) instead, you have an 
overlap.
And your code is somewhat wrong. Given that exec() would stand for 
execve(someprogram_and_args_here), if it returned -1 you would return 0, 
indicating success. Can't be. And if exec() does not return -1, which it 
never should, you return errno, which never reaches anyone.
