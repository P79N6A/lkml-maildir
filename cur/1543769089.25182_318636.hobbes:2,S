I hit the same problem trying to add sysctl's from inside the LSM.  What I
ended up doing was letting the security_initcall() set up the *other* stuff I
needed, and then had a regular initcall() that ended up called after sysctl was
initialized, but before we went to userspace.  I'm pretty sure that all the
initcall chails get run before we mount the initrd and all that.
