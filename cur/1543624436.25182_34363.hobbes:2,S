Okay, I understand this part :)
But what's with the more important one? Isn't that simply readable
from the BIOS somehow?
Doesn't store the BIOS the devices used for ACPI wakeup somewhere
in the ACPI tables?
Can't one read them out there?
And if not - is there actually a syscall interface where i can reach
acpi_hw_enable_gpe_for_wakeup()?
And if so - how can I translate devices to GPE numbers?
thanks & regards,
