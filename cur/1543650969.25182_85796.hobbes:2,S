The logic you seem to be missing is, the Washington Monument is a
physical object.  Linus's source tree is a collection of "copied" parts 
from other peoples source trees.  You obviously see his source copy 
as special, more so then say my copy.  This is true _ONLY_ because 
Linus's copy commands more respect then yours or mine.  
If you think about it, the respect Linus's copy has is _PURELY_ 
the result of his past _choices_ over how he maintains it.
In effect you are saying: 
Patrick: "Everyone trusts your source tree, I think LKCD 
is SUPER DUPER important and should get the exposure and trust 
that being in your tree commands." 
Linus: "I think LKCD is a bad idea, until I am convinced otherwise I 
will not merge it."  
Patrick: "You are wrong, LKCD should be in your copy of the kernel source.
It is your Job Linus, to add things to _your_ copy which others find 
important, what you think is secondary."
You cannot have it both ways, either Linus's tree is a dumping 
grounds for all ideas (both good and bad) or it is a place for good 
ideas (good defined by Linus) where people who trust Linus's judgment can 
work from.
In truth you can have it both ways.  Take Linus's existing copy, add the 
features you think are important.  If your choices prove to be superior. 
you can expect that people (over time) will begin to trust/respect your 
copy more then Linus's.
