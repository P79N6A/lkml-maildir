We've been seeing rather variable results for TSO as well. With TSO off
netperf TCP_STREAM will hit line speed and stay there. With TSO on
some runs will hit line speed and others will be about 100Mbit/sec
slower.

Yep we definitely noticed much more higher allocations when watching
/proc/slab. Playing around with slab tuning didnt seem to help.
