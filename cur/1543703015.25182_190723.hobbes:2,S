Greetings all;
I have a problem running a kde app (ksysguard or kpm) that forks the 
actual app from the script that runs it, but the actual app itself 
has connection problems.  An strace only traces the apps invocation 
up to the point of the fork call, and it is therefore no help with 
the application proper as it doesn't get traced.
Is there a way to make the app itself inherit the strace so that its 
errors can be located/defined and fixed?
