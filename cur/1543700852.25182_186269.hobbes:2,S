Sure, and you can do it as
	tmp = d;
	a ? b = tmp : c = tmp;
instead if you want to. It all depends on what b/c actually are (ie maybe
they are memory-backed anyway).
The point being that there are no actual _advantages_ to being
non-standard. And there are definitely disadvantages. Lack of portability
being one, semantic confusion being another (the semantic confusion is
more visible in C++, since there lvalue'ness is more complex. But it's
visible in C too, where the gcc extensions can cause buggy programs that
_should_ give syntax errors to possibly compile to unexpected results).
