Err, but that's not guaranteed to produce what you expect.  Although GCC
(and ANSI compilers) are not allowed to re-order the elements of a
structure, they are allowed to add padding (unused bytes) between elements
of the structure.  (Yes, we've encountered this before).
The only truely portable way of doing this type of thing is to use either
integer or char arrays.

From reading IO-mapping.txt, it appears that the correct way is to:
	char *my_ptr;
	my_ptr = ioremap(...);
	my_reg = readb(my_ptr + reg_offset);
BTW, isn't it about time this document was updated wrt the isa_* macros?
It currently implies that it's ok to do:
	reg = readb(0xc0000)
to read ISA address 0xc0000, which seems it should now be:
	reg = isa_readb(0xc0000)
at the very least.
