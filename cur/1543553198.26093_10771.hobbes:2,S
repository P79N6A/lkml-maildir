Because the stuff on the initrd is not at all what I want in the resultant filesystem. The machine(s) in question are some disk-based some disk-less. I have a system for remote installation/removal of packages (--> the "partition" _has_ to be able to grove/shrink). 
The package builder should not have to worry about these details, so the directory hierarcy cannot contain any traces of _how_ the packges got there in the first place.
