This is totally undesirable.  We don't want the device sending
out MSI messages unless the driver for it explicitly knows
that it is operating the device in this mode.
TG3 will disable MSI for several chip variants as well.  It will
also disable MSI if it's internal self-test of MSI functionality
fails.
