Sort of, but incomplete....
The real-mode segment is a 16-byte thing:
 	0001:0000	=  0x00000010
 	0002:0000	=  0x00000020
 	0003:0000	=  0x00000030
 	b801:0000	=  0x000B8010
 	b802:0000	=  0x000B8020
 	b803:0000	=  0x000B8030
To get the physical address, you multiply the
segment by 0x10 and add the offset. To access
these in 32-bit "linear" mode, you use the
address on the right. To access these in paged-
mode on Linux, you OR in PAGE_OFFSET. This
is an artifact of how the low-memory page-tables
were written. It is not the "correct" way. There
are macros available to perform the translation
for you if you are making some driver that needs
to work over many kernel versions.
