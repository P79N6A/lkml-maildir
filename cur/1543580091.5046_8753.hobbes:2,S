FWIW, I have seen behaviour like this under kernel 2.2.x and 2.4.x,
for me taking the interface down and then bringing it back up usually
makes the problem stop, at least for the moment.
I have always assumed that it is caused by a bug in the Ethernet card
driver, as the first time I noticed this behaviour, I was using the
Realtek 8139 driver about two years ago, it was really not good
hardware and the driver was pretty new.  Anyway, it would do this, so
I contacted Donald Becker about it, he pointed me to a newer version
of the driver that did it _much_ less often.
Cheers,
Wayne
