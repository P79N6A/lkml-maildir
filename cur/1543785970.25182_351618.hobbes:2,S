Subject: PATCH: Fix race in cpu_down (hotplug cpu)

Hi.
There is a race condition in taking down a cpu (kernel/cpu.c::cpu_down).
A cpu can already be idling when we clear its online flag, and we do not
force the idle task to reschedule. This results in __cpu_die timing out.
A simple fix is to force the idle task on the cpu going to reschedule.
Without the patch below, Suspend2 get into a deadlock at resume time
when this issue occurs. I could not complete 20 cycles without seeing
the issue. With the patch below, I have completed 75 cycles on the trot
without problems.
Please apply.
