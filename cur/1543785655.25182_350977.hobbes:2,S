If this is really needed, we can just create a "interfaces" directory at
every "class" top-level and put symlinks pointing to all interfaces of that
class into it. How does that sound?

Well, this is just putting two different classes into one subdirectory. :)
We would better just add "/sys/class/input_device" and don't need to change
any userspace software then.
Sure there is the cosmetical difference that the two classes are just named
input* and not live in the same directory, but that's not enough reason
to start a complete different model in sysfs, I think.
I would like to have the option to move "block" into "class" some day
and therefore prefer the "stacking class devices", compared to the "grouping
and symlinking" classes model.
