Hello,
If the fragmentation number (say, 17.4%) is a statement of how many 
files are not fully contiguous, it's not really telling you much. 
E.g., it doesn't tell you how many fragments are typically occupied 
by non-contiguous files or whether it's occurring to small files as 
well as large ones.
If we knew some more detailed statistics about the number of 
fragments into which the files are broken and how fragment counts are 
distributed over different file sizes, it would help. It might also 
be useful to know about internal fragmentation (space wasted due to 
minimum allocation increments).
With some of these more detailed statistics, it might be possible to 
optimize a file system by re-creating it (via: "dump; mke2fs 
-better_parameters; restore") after it had been in use long enough 
for the statistics to be representative of file sizes and growth 
patterns.
Presumably adding some more detailed statistical output to e2fsck 
wouldn't be too difficult?
Sorry, though, I'm not volunteering. I have neither the ext2 
knowledge nor the time to implement this suggestion.
