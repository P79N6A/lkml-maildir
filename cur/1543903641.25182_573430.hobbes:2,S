how do you deal with the "power at idle" vs "power at full load".. you
need both at each level to pick the best one, as well as relative
performance etc.

it doesn't.

no I want to run at the max frequency PERIOD. On just about any PC, it's
more power efficient to go full speed when executing code, and then idle
for as long as you can. (there are some second order effects that make
this a bit more complex, but as first order approach it's a sound
approach). Voltage follows, and that's fine.

why would I care about voltage? Most PCs don't expose it, and that's
fine, they can switch to the voltage needed REALLY quickly (single or
double digit microseconds). PCs in fact only expose numbered states (P0
to P7 at most), and some number that you can use to show the user, but
doesn't mean anything beyond that. Some people interpret it as
"frequency", and that's nice, but it doesn't really mean that. You
really don't know anything beyond that....
and that's ok. As I said before, as a general strategy you want "highest
speed when running code" for race-to-idle, with some 2nd order effects
for when you execute code really shortly coming out of idle; in which
case you don't want to do a voltage transition twice (most cpus have the
idle voltage be the lowest-execute voltage as well).

that actually is the example showcase of race-to-idle where you
absolutely want to run at the highest frequency..
