Greetings;
I just rebooted to a new config of 2.6.24, basically trying to strip out the 
building of modules I don't use.  And I enabled a couple of checks that 
weren't checked in the kernel-hacking menu.  .config posted on request.
Now the messages log is being spammed at 2-5 second intervals by these:
Feb  1 10:41:08 coyote kernel: [ 3085.501037] MCE: The hardware reports a non 
fatal, correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
Feb  1 10:41:08 coyote kernel: [ 3085.501042] Bank 1: d400400000000152
Feb  1 10:41:08 coyote kernel: [ 3085.501045] MCE: The hardware reports a non 
fatal, correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
Feb  1 10:41:08 coyote kernel: [ 3085.501048] Bank 2: d40040000000017a
Always the same 2 addresses.  Is this telling me I should be running memtest86 
for a couple of cycles?
Thanks.
