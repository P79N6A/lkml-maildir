The console driver should not be hijacking /dev/tty or /dev/ttyS
devices. Instead, it should use its own char device, like the pSeries
hypervisor console does (/dev/hvc).
Yes, I understand that installers, inittab, and securetty files will
need to be updated. Luckily, there are a couple of distros interested in
supporting Xen who I suspect will be able to help.
