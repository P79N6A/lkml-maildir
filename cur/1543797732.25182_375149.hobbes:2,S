No. The ACPI Mafia^H^H^Hintainers :-) no longer accept any hotkey drivers
and IIUC it will be reimplemented in a generic driver. This driver
then should pipe the hotkey events to the input subsystem.
Disclaimer: i cannot judge if the pcc_acpi code is "nice" or particularly
correct, but it works fine (for me).
