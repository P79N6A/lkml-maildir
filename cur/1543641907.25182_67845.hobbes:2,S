Do you know if this is one of the default checks from spamassassin?
I would imagine that a lot of people (including myself) have it
installed, so it is possible that it (or some other widely-used tool)
now does this sort of check out-of-the-box, and the people who are
installing them have no idea about the kind of load it generates on vger.
I doubt that there are a large number of people who are independently
misconfiguring their mail setup this way
If it is possible to track what tool is causing the problem and fixing
the default setup of that tool at the source, it will probably solve
99% of the problems in one go (after the list knows to which version
they should upgrade).
Cheers, Andreas
