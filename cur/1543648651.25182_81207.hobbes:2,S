Actuall, yes it does, and that is the point. You don't have to like 
SELinux's system calls, or any other module's syscalls. The whole point 
of LSM was to decouple security design from the Linux kernel development.
There are a butt-load of different access control models, and many of 
them are not compatible with one another. You wouldn't want to support 
them all--that would be serious bloat. So instead, LSM lets each user 
choose the model that suits them:
    * server users can choose a highly secure model
    * workstation users can choose something desktop oriented
    * embedded people can choose nothing at all, or the specific
      narrow-cast model that they need
On the other hand: what is the big cost here? One system call. Isn't 
that actually *lower* overhead than the (say) half dozen 
security-oriented syscalls we might convince you to accept if we drop 
the sys_security syscall as you suggest? Why the fierce desire to remove 
something so cheap?
