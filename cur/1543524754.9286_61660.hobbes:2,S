Yes, if there's one packet there, then the read will properly grab it. 
What if your read loop doesn't get to reading the tap device before a 
second or 3rd packet is sent by the linux ip stack? How does the 
simple "read hoping for a packet" method cater for multiple packets in 
that devices buffer? What if the ip stack decided to fragment the 
packet?
Also, is the placement of packets in the tap devices buffer 
necessarily atomic? If not, then partial packets must surely be a problem.
I'm currently changing my code to make the assumption you've suggested 
(& that I mentioned), & for what I want to do, might not have the 
problems I'm suggesting, but I'd still like to know....
Thanks for your help, Rusty.
