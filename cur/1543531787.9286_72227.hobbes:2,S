Subject: USB and ISAPnP Modem PROBLEMS on 2.3 kernels

On just about every 2.3 kernel (and 2.3.99pre3 as well) I have never been able to solve these two problems:
USB: Depmod -a doesn't do dependency information, always sais "undefined symbols".  I've tried a lot of stuff and it just doesn't
happen.  This is probably common, but why, and when will it be fixed?  Insmodding every module is a pain...
ISAPnP Modem: My 56k Zoom modem, which works just fine on /dev/ttyS2 if I setserial it with irq 5 and port 0x03e8 on 2.2 kernels, no
longer works.  I figure it might be an ISAPnP/kernel or setserial/kernel problem...
Any continuing comments on this post, anything that may help get my modem working, that'd be greatly appreciated.  The device ID is
OZO800f by the way.
