Yes, I mean more aggressive
static void __init smp_init(void)
{
        unsigned int i;
        /* FIXME: This should be done in userspace --RR */
        for_each_present_cpu(i) {
                if (num_online_cpus() >= max_cpus)
                        break;
                if (!cpu_online(i))
                        cpu_up(i);
        }
let cpu_up take one array instead of one int.
So  in do_boot_cpu() of smpboot.c
                /*
                 * Wait 5s total for a response
                 */
                for (timeout = 0; timeout < 50000; timeout++) {
                        if (cpu_isset(cpu, cpu_callin_map))
                                break;  /* It has booted */
                        udelay(100);
                }
could wait all be cpu_callin_map is set.
then we can spare more time.
