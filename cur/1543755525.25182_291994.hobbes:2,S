I apologise for this bug. If someone had pointed this out in a clear and 
to-the-point kind of way, then this would have been fixed a long time ago.
Anyways, if anyone else has any suggestions, fixes, or special wishes for 
PaXtest (some exec-shield specific tests perhaps?), then please speak up now. 
I'd rather not bother this list again about PaXtest related issues.
Groetjes,
Peter.
