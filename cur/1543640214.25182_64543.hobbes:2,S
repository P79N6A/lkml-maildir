I have a large patch (>130KB) against 2.5.31 converting most of oss 
sound drivers to
use spinlocks instead of cli() - so that they compile on SMP systems.
Most changes are trivial but I think some drivers are simply not SMP 
safe. I hope I haven't
break any drivers. Since one can argue that OSS in the kernel gets 
obsolete and there are
no maintainers for individual drivers I would  prefer NOT to split the 
patches for each
individual driver.
Some like the GUS driver and the dmabuf.c were more complicated - I had 
to change the
locking a lot. Now if I grep through the kernel source with
/usr/src/linux-2.5.31:>find . -name "*.c"| xargs egrep 'cli[ \t]*\(\)' | 
wc -l
    1838
Is the usage of cli() really obsolete? Will all occurences will be fixed 
as stated in
/usr/src/linux-2.5.31/include/linux/interrupt.h
/*
  * Temporary defines for UP kernels, until all code gets fixed.

#if !CONFIG_SMP
# define cli()                  local_irq_disable()
# define sti()                  local_irq_enable()
# define save_flags(x)          local_irq_save(x)
# define restore_flags(x)       local_irq_restore(x)
# define save_and_cli(x)        local_irq_save_off(x)
#endif
