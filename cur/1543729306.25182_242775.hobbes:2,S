The existing code didn't allow reuse of the hwif. It leaked it forever
each time because the chipset was left randomly set to pci. ide_unknown is
used by the scanning code in various places to mean "reusable". It has no
impact on ordering I can see because you don't hotplug ide until after
the boot sequence is complete. Once you do hotplug well the order is already
intriguing although it will preserve the pre setup legacy interfaces.

I've done some basic testing on things like unload invalidate. It would
have missed the unload/reload one. As discussed earlier I'm trying some
alternatives - refcount turns out to get really horrible because unless
we switch to refcounting -everything- in one go we get unregisters that
can randomly fail as busy depending on /proc and other accesses, and
code that isnt meant to cope with this.

No. Follow the locking. You have to move that locking outwards and I
already did so. Remember ata_attach is only safe under the setting sem.
The attach methods should always have ben called under setting_sem but
were not. Now they are so they in turn call the setting functions safely.

It's unsafe for the PCI case. Its also unsafe for every other case. Thats
why I have a fixme tagged on it 8)

Once you have drive and controller hot plug you don't need them. Until then
some laptop users rely on them. I'd prefer to ignore the issue (its a
privileged code path) until the hotplug is there, or patch it up by
allowing unregister only of SCAN_HWIF added hwifs ?
