I don't usually participate in flamewars, but he's right Larry.
You just insulted most of the Open Source community, even though
you seem to be using Open Source as a bitkeeper selling point...
Besides, Open Source is the _only_ guarantee that the product
will be around in 20 years. If bitmover falls apart or gets
aquired by someone, we have no chance in hell to keep using
bitkeeper -- and that's all because of that weird licensing.
