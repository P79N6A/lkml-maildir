	when i was running seti@home (more than 10k WU, 7y), i was using a a
home-maid script that controled the seti process. when load > <value> i
was stopping seti (SIGSTOP) then, when load <value>, i was restarting it
(SIGCONT). i was using a kind of fuzzy logic to prevent from too
frequent switchs and i was polling the 3 loads to make a efficient
decision. that way, i was able to get 100% of my cpu when it was
needed : while playing quake or comipiling a big stuff.
