Unfortunately:
* there are static executables out there.
* I'm afraid that people around dynamic linker would simply tell me to
put it into kernel
* there are 2 different dynamic linkers (libc5 a glibc), but there's
only one kernel.
I think that it is better to put into kernel than to put into dynamic
loader; which is in turn better than having it nowhere at all.
