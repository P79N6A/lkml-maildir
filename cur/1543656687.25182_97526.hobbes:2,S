Hi Dave,
just to inform you:
I have requested the KT400 agp specs from VIA.
I'll receive the docs in 1-2 days.
As far as i have the docs, I can help you with on the VIA AGP 3 issue.
My state:
	- found a 2.4.20-rc? patch for the Intel 7505 with agp 3 support.
	- copied via_generic_setup to via_kt400_setup and modified it to
agp3
	- waiting for the via specs

Silvio

The AGP only works if the chipset is in 2.0 compatability mode.
Luckily some BIOSen out there seem to do that if a 2.0 card is present.
If you have an AGP 3.0 card in there you're shit out of luck right now.
I'm working on it..
