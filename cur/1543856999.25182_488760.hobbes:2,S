The old iso API of (lib)raw1394 has been marked deprecated and
undocumented in libraw1394's documentation for some time, and will go
away in 2007.
Dv1394 might go away in 2007 too if there is enough effort to move
high-profile users over to rawiso a.k.a. the current iso API of
(lib)raw1394.
I suppose video1394 might get a viable migration path with your new
driver, if you and interested developers put effort into development
(and help with deployment) of a proper replacement.

You have to look at the matter not only from the POV of API design but
also of deployment and support.

I have to say, the really really old bug reports which piled up for
ohci1394 (high latency of the reset event handler, streaming packets
being mistaken as selfID packets...) and the recently reported ohci1394
bugs (event mask being mysteriously blanked out...) and my lack of
progress with these speak for themselves. (I don't have enough insight
yet, nor enough spare time nor affected hardware to make reasonable
headway.)
