easier to use option? isn`t badram meant to be used together with memtest86 and 
isn`t that patterns generated by memtest86 already meant to provide a highly efficient way 
to specify bad memory regions ? i don`t see where there is room for optimization here. 
see that slightly outdate linuxjournal article at 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4489
  
or the "Capturing errors in a pattern" chapter inside the patch.
