Agreed. Good point. But this can be mitigated if the code using "unsigned int"
(or unsigned byte) first loads the value into a local unsigned long variable.
That typically translates into a tmp register anyway. Compiler will help
you find places where that needs to happen.
Counter point is bit arrays (e.g. bit maps) like cpumask_t are
typically much larger than 32-bits (typically distro's ship with
NR_CPUS set to 256 or so).  File system code also likes bit arrays
for block allocation tables. Searching a bit array using unsigned
long is 2x faster on 64-bit architectures. I don't want to give
that up and I'm pretty sure Tony Luck, Paul Mckerras and a few
others would object unless you can give a better reason.
Obviously neither memory footprint nor speed of walking memory is an
the issue for 32-bit arches (where unsigned long == unsigned int).

agreed. I was thinking mostly of the bit map search - not searching
within a single unsigned int.
