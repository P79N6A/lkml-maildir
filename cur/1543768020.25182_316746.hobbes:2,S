We need to do this anyways for RCU, because fully idle CPUs don't go
through quiescent states and could stall the whole RCU system.
But it has to be *really* lightweight because these transistion can
happen a lot (consider a CPU that very often goes to sleep for a short time)

I am not sure how useful it is to make this heavy weight by involving
more subsystems. I would try to keep the idle state as lightweight
as possible, to keep the cost of going to sleep/waking up low.
