Not so easy. Many persons have drivers that must be installed using
initrd (SCSI, Firewire,  etc.) before their root file-systems are
accessible.
This means that there isn't a general-purpose tool that you can
take with you (except another PC, you can use to mount the
locked disk). NotGood(tm). Sun allows their install CD/ROM to
be used for repair. Other vendors did this also. New "security"
out of Red-Hat seems to prevent this, ALF-F2, etc., used to bring
up other virtual terminals. They don't anymore. I think every
OS vendor should be required to spend a few weeks in the field,
preferably in Afghanistan <grin>, before they even consider mucking
with accepted principles.
