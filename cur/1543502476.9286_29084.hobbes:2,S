I reckon a spare CPU could happily
  -  pre-zero some pages, preferably spread over the range of page colours.
  -  move pages around to make space for multi-page allocations.
  -  checksum pages to find duplicates and merge them in the background

Uusually the overhead of TLB flushes or the need for inter-CPU TLB
flush messages is given as the reason.
But there are cases when those can be shown to be not necessary.
Like when you read a page, and the pte is not marked "accessed" yet.
No TLB flush required.
Similarly when you write a page and its marked "dirty" but not
"accessed" -- I'm not sure if this combination (written but not read) is
flagged by CPUs though.
