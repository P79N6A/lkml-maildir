Btw, Jesse, what's the schedule for merging the pci thing.
I'm currently planning on -rc1 next weekend, which gives us time to do at 
least a shortened -rc2 before people are at LCA. And the suspend/resume 
changes are some of the more "exciting" (aka scary) parts of the whole 
merge window, so I'd rather get them merged with a few days to go, rather 
than just before -rc1.
In fact, they are probably more scary than the cpumask changes, since at 
least the cpumask issues are likely to not be a big deal with any normal 
sane config (ie you really do have to enable MAXSMP to hit the stack usage 
issues). So if you end up waiting for those, I'd rather prefer to first 
merge the rest of the PCI code.
Or did the PCI late-suspend/early-resume patches go in somebody elses 
tree and I'm barking up the wrong tree entirely?
