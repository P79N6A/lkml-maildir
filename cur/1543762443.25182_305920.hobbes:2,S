Subject: Problem applying latest 2.6 kernel prepatch(2.6.12-rc1)

Hi,
I am trying to submit patches to our driver in the kernel. Since I need a
copy of latest kernel
for this, I installed the latest stable version(2.6.5.11). When I apply the
latest prepatch (2.6.12-rc1)
on top of this, I have the following problems:
1. On application of the prepatch, it reports errors. It looks like some of
the changes that the
    prepatch is trying to apply are already present in 2.6.5.11.
2. If I ignore these errors and complete the patching, the kernel
compilation fails.
Has anybody else seen this problem or am I missing something ?
Thanks,
Ravi
