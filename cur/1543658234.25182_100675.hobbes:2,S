There is something not quite right about this patch. I used have a ton
of errors in my logs, and this patch seemed to clear this out nicely.
When I run with a patched driver now, I run for about 20 minutes with
various loads and sudenly the ksoftirqd_CPU0 process starts to hog my
CPU and not wanting to let go. As soon as I pull out the card, the
load returns to normal.
Is there any way I can provide more details on what is happening?
