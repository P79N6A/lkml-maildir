Umm, you forgot about SMP. Modifying it on context switch would require
per CPU mappings and vsyscall pages. Currently the kernel page tables
are shared globally, changing them to be CPU local would be somewhat
involved. While it would be doable as long as x86-64 is limited to three
level page tables for user space it would be a major pain as soon
as four level page tables were supported. In this case multiple threads
sharing the same mm but running on multiple CPUs couldn't share the same 
page table anymore, and changing that would make threading significantly
more complicated. On i386 this problem is always there.
Also the context switch is a very critical path, we don't want to add
random junk like this in there.

A test+branch here is completely lost in the noise, not even
worth thinking about.

I have no problems at all with a system global flag. After all vsyscalls
are just an optimization. When you use UML you can't use that optimization,
very simple. It's similar to other circumstances that have an impact
on the whole system, e.g. when you use floating point in any process 
then the context switch becomes slower for everybody. Not a big deal.
