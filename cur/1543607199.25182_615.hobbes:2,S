Well I thought I would send a reply to my own Oops, so when this
hits the archives, maybe someone can get something from it.  As it
turns out, it was bad RAM that was causing the problem.  With 2.2 I
never got Sig 11s on kernel compiles, but I tried a 2.4 compile on
this machine and sure enough, Sig 11.  Other tests revealed it was
NOT a kernel bug, but instead RAM.
Sorry for the posts.
Jamie
