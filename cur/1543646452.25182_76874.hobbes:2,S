Because they are in uninterruptible sleep.  They are doing something
important, presumably in a critical section, and have no wake-up path
for signals or errors.
Finally, they probably hold a semaphore.  In short, you cannot kill
them, nor would you want to.
I would simplify the question and ask why are you killing the autofs
daemon?  Clearly this is a recipe for disaster.
