Well, after that I tried to verify that 22 is really fine. 
Unfortunatelly under heavy load its the same... even with .19 (the 
oldes kernel I have still installed)
I just noticed it, because its harder to produce it on .22 and before. 
You guys tuned the kernel so it was easier.
So it must be something in userspace, please excuse me ;)
