Oh my God... time for me to check what is a colloquialism :)
According to wikipedia :
A colloquialism is an expression not used in formal speech, 
writing or paralinguistics. Colloquialisms are also sometimes 
referred to collectively as "colloquial language". [1] Colloquialisms
or colloquial language is considered to be characteristic of or only
appropriate for casual, ordinary, familiar, or informal conversation
rather than formal speech or writing.[2] Dictionaries often display
colloquial words and phrases with the abbreviation colloq. as an identifier.
Ouch... back to coding :)
