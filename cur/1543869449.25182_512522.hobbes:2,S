Alan,
Where are you looking for sata_mv driver support.
if you look in the sata_mv.c it has support for the 
7042 throughout it (exactly the same as PCI in fact - 
its the same core chip - just different bus interface)...
but agreed an unknown device in the pci ids...or is 
there another place where I should be looking for 
7042 support?
or does it look in pci ids & if it doesn't know 
the registered device type (chip) - it doesn't 
probe it - even if it does a pci_register_device()?
????
I am sorry for being so Naive here - but obviously
there is a disconnect here (there is some PEBKAC...:-)
