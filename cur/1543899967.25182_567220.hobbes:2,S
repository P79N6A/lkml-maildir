No.  It doesn't help.
99% of the kernel directory is C.  That means any random passerby can review 
code.  Everyone who has the kernel tarball should be able to review code 
that's in there, plus when you compile it breaks.  So merging _code_ into the 
kernel helps keep it up to date.
Merging documentation into the kernel doesn't help keep it up to date, because 
documentation being out of date doesn't break the build.  It may get the 
documentation more review, but the existing state of Documentation/* argues 
against that.  It's a struggle to keep the english versions on the same 
continent as "up to date" or "complete", and most of the _good_ documentation 
is out in OLS papers and such (which I'm off indexing as we speak).
Now add in the non-english nature of the new Documentation/stale 
subdirectories you're proposing.  Almost nobody in the existing kernel 
community can even _read_ this documentation, let alone update it.  People 
who update Documentation/* _can't_ update the translations, and that will 
_never_change_.
Merging into the kernel is a great way to keep CODE up to date.  Don't think 
it's magic pixie dust for documentation.  It never has been before.

Ah, but It's not a language maintainer's job to update documentation.  It's 
their job to ACCEPT PATCHES.  Translate patches, translate questions back and 
forth.  This has NOTHING to do with documentation unless they're converting 
documentation accompanying the patch one way; into english.

Keeping translations up to date is not something I can do, and thus not my 
problem.

Thank you.  You've just scared away all potential language maintainers by 
making them think we want them to translate all the world's existing 
documentation.  Do you know how long it takes just to read through the 
existing Documentation directory?  (Have you done it?)
When I'm talking about language maintainers I am NOT looking for them to 
translate existing documentation or keep Documentation/* up to date for some 
other langauge.  That's a more than full-time job.  I've been looking around 
for weeks for someone to just accept Japanese patches, and everybody I've 
talked to says it's too much time commitment without any extra work piled on 
top of it in by armchair commentators who won't be _doing_ that work.
