Andrew makes a good point, even if the humour around it is lost on
Americans. Most people do not understand flush_dcache_page,
flush_icache_page, flush_icache_range, flush_page_to_ram.
Perhaps invalidate_icache_* and writeback_dcache_* would make more sense
but the current functions are so ingrained it would be a hard thing to do.
