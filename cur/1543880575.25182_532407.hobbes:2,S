yeah, indeed. I hoped that once this rightmost entry is removed (as soon 
as it gets scheduled next time) the tree goes back to a correct shape, 
but that's not the case - the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree is 
merged by the rbtree code with the assumption that the entry had a 
correct key.

yeah. I had that implemented at a stage but was trying to be too clever 
for my own good ;-)
