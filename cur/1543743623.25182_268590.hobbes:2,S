Subject: [PATCH] fix pnpbios fault message
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When your plug-n-play BIOS is truly broken and generates a fault
during use, we report this and suggest disabling it.  The message
produced suggests using "nobiospnp" to achive this, the correct
option is "pnpbios=off".  This patch upates the message.
