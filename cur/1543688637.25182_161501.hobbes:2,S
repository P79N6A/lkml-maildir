Having checked back, this was changed between test-2 and test-3.  The 
checking code in k7_machine_check() still loops from 0 rather than 1.  I 
think this may be leading to false reporting of problems, which may be why I 
and Tomasz are seeing these MCE messages on our Athlons.
Anyone who knows more about this stuff care to comment?  Is someone looking 
after MCE at the moment?  I couldn't find out much info on it.
Thanks,
Matt
