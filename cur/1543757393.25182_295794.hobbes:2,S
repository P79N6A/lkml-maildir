I tried:
	2.6.11-rc3-mm2 + Xorg + DRI disabled
and this works.
I cannot enable dri/drm with the cvs version of the drm modules, because
the drm modules do not compile for -mm kernels, since there is the patch
for multiple agp bridges included (that's the reason why I tried -rc4
without mm) and the drm modules from drm-trunk-module-src are not
prepared to the change of the api. I even tried to incorporate the
changes to the api but gave up.
I *can* active dri but with the builtin kernel drm modules, which makes
the kernel freeze while resuming.

NO!!! Most interestingly: Doing a suspend from single user mode makes
the machine freeze (not even sysrq!)
I suspect that it has to do with the restoring of graphics state with
vbetool from a data set which was taken *while* running X: My
suspend2ram script looks like this (as suggested here):
statedir=/root/s3/state
/usr/bin/chvt 1
cat /dev/vcsa >$statedir/vcsa
sync
echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep
sync
vbetool post
vbetool vbestate restore <$statedir/vbe
cat $statedir/vcsa >/dev/vcsa
...
but $statedir/vbe was taken once for XFree86 running. Can this be the
reason for the freeze?
Best wishes
Norbert
