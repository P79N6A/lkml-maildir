i apologize that I haven't gone through the patch but how do you switch
from one to the other? I am assuming that you set a flag that says "use
the old" and at the beginning of the scheduler you test the flag. If this
is the case then that test adds to the overhead (and as tuned as the
scheduler is probably noticably), the other option is to call the
scheduler routine through a pointer, again producing some overhead every
call.
If you hav another method that I have not thought of please mention it.
