I believe I just did that :)
Before the patch :
Alignment was only 4 bytes for all futexes, but some user app could trigger a kernel bug (since one 64bit futex could sit on two different pages, so possible separate vmas, so the inode refcounting was wrong, and access_ok did not a correct check)
After the patch :
Alignment is 8 bytes for 64 bit futexes, 4 bytes for 32bit futexes.
All futexes are contrained to be in one single page.
