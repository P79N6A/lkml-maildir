Ok, back up.
Let's look at _english_ documentation.
If you go to 
http://kernel.org/doc/ols
 you should find, nicely split up, all 
the OLS papers from 2002-2007.  By my count, there are 337 of them, totaling 
61.8 megabytes when they're split up like that.  Being PDFs, they don't 
compress all that well.
Which subset of these should be copied into the Documentation directory?  How 
do you update them?  This is the documentation from just ONE SOURCE.
And PDF isn't close to the worst of it: Linuxconf.au has lots of video, as 
does google video.  (I don't even have _english_ transcripts for those 
videos, which would be nice.)  Do you want to merge all of this into the 
kernel tarball as well?
How does this help keep anything up to date?
