Users need to have 'dangerous' things done, like reading and
writing to hard-disks, etc. To keep things organized, like
writing and reading files they control, there is some code
called the kernel, that performs these 'dangerous' things on
behalf of the callers. Since the callers can't modify the kernel
to make it do "bad" things like writing outside "files",  everything
works out just fine. The exact same things can usually be done by
"user-mode" programs. You just need to keep them from being hacked and
everything works out just fine, just like in the kernel.
Cheers,
