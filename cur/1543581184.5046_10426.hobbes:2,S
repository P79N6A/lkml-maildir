Hi everyone,
I have just installed the new gcc version in Mandrake (2.96-0.34). The
interesting point (related to kernel) is (rpm --chagelog):
- Big Red Hat merge, bring updated cpp BTW.
- (Red Hat patches, Jakub Jelinek (rel72) 7 new patches, 1 new tarball
..
  - optimize out comparisons of two constants if at least one comes from
    inline function arguments (visible e.g. on undefined __bad_udelay
    symbols from some linux 2.4.0 kernel modules)
  - put in updated preprocessor, it seems stable enough and has tons of bugs
    against both gcc 2.95.2 cccp and cpp used in 2.96-RH until now
and more fixes related to assembly output, which importance I don't fully
realize.
