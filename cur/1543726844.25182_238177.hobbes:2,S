Okay, this is not encouraging.

This is a rather painful state of affairs. I'm not convinced external
fragmentation in the IOMMU address space is insurmountable as the
physically contiguous segments can (in principle; the mechanics of
ramming this through the IO subsystem are another matter entirely) be
IO-mapped in a bus-discontiguous fashion.
I'm not familiar with the TCE space regions; could you describe or
point to documentation for the semantics there?
My first thought is to artificially limit the amount of physical
merging (hopefully to some nonzero amount instead of disabling it
entirely) allowed to take place in order to allow for better virtual
merging.
