I really don't think there's much of a place for spyware in Linux. I'm 
sure that some company (should that be plural?) will manufacture such 
crap -- the issue is getting users to install it. (The +x bit 
goes a long, long way here to preventing users from doing this 
unknowingly.)
I feel about a billion times safer bringing everything in from Portage and 
kernel.org than I do running *anything* I got for money. (specifically, 
anything I can't tear open...) I think the possibility of deliberate 
malware being sent out through official channels isn't too terribly 
likely.
Free software isn't totally safe from malicious tinkering... this bit from 
Ken Thompson says a lot:
http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html
The thing is that there is enough peer review in the open source world 
that not only would it be *difficult* to slip in some intentionally 
malicious code (and I don't think any malicious code of much potential 
would be likely to make it past LKML, especially if it doesn't closely 
adhere to CodingStyle :P) but it would not be long before someone noticed it.
Think about it - let's suppose we all fell asleep at the wheel, and 
someone did manage to get something nasty into Linus's tree. Not having a 
stable kernel API wins *yet again* because sooner or later the malicious code is 
going to break, and someone is going to end up asking questions. :)
What's the saying - "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow?" How 
about "Given enough eyeballs, all malware is in plain sight."
