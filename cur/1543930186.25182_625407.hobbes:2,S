Does LAPIC allow to disable a specific vector and not accept interrupts? I
don't think so. If a timer interrupt is broadcasted to every cpu I think
everybody will accept it (like broadcast IPI). That's why intelligence
is built into IOAPIC and direct interrupts to a cpu or group of cpu.
I am just trying to understand the functionality better. Can somebody help me
understand how do we make sure that same timer interrupt is not processed by
all cpus (assuming hypertransport is broadcasting it)?

Again for my understanding, I got few questions.
- Why does nvidia choose not to broadcast the interrupts and still works
  fine? Does that mean nvidia chipse will not work the extended cpu apic
  ids?
- IOW, why do other chipsets choose to broadcast the interrupts and 
  nvidia chooses not to and still works well.
- Why do I need to broadcast the interrupts and not target specific cpus?
- If I am broadcasting interrupts, how do I make sure only one cpu
  picks it up.
