Hello,
I'm still not using 2.2.x but I think it is great to have auto route.
Solaris, Irix & Cisco is doing it for sure, (for Cisco you can't even
cancel the route once the interface is up).
Will it be also for IP-aliases on 2.2.x ? (Cisco is doing it)
As for the classless issue on Cisco conf it will be:
ip classless 
And zero subnet is:
ip subnet-zero
> Here is a WORKING network setup, that would break if auto-route was in use.
Of course, you need to do it differently :-)
