Uhh....  Why?  I can post initramfs patches tonight - unpacking and populating
initramfs is trivial and I can't think of any reason why initrd would be
useful here (BTW, you could have picked uncpio code from l-k posting -
3Kb, deals with links properly, doesn't mess with ramdisk at all).
 
Anyway, the real problem with iniramfs is on the build side.  I.e. what
do we want in makefiles for early userland/what do we want to use as
libc?
Until that is done the ungzip/uncpio part is pretty much pointless...  It
can go into the kernel anytime, but what would it give us if we don't have
stuff to put in there?
