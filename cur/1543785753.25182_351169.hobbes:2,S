Subject: [KORG] REMINDER: master.kernel.org extended downtime
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

master.kernel.org will be offline starting shortly after 15:00 PDT/22:00 
UTC today, September 19, 2005; for a move to the University of Oregon 
Open Source Lab.  This should give much better bandwidth and a more 
reliable backup solution, in addition to access to a real, staffed NOC.
Special thanks to Javier Henderson for volunteering to fly the machine 
up there by private airplane, thus minimizing downtime.
It is expected to be back online around 12:00 PDT/19:00 UTC tomorrow, 
Saturday, September 20.  The new IP address of the machine will be 
140.211.167.34.
