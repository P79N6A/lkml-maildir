Subject: [PATCH] mm: Fix memory hotplug oops from ZONE_MOVABLE changes.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/31

zone_movable_pfn is presently marked as __initdata and referenced
from adjust_zone_range_for_zone_movable(), which in turn is
referenced by zone_spanned_pages_in_node(). Both of these are
__meminit annotated. When memory hotplug is enabled, this will oops
on a hot-add, due to zone_movable_pfn having been freed.
__meminitdata annotation gives the desired behaviour.
This will only impact platforms that enable both memory hotplug
and ARCH_POPULATES_NODE_MAP.
