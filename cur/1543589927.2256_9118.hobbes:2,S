Dear all:
I am writing linux driver now, when I install driver modules in other Linux
Distributions(Like RedHat, OpenLinux..) ,
 the installation will be successful.
But when I install driver in SUSE Linux, it always appear the following
message:
driver.o: kernel-module version mismatch
	driver.o was compiled for kernel version 2.2.16
	while this kernel is version 2.2.16-SMP.
If I modify the definition of  UTS_RELEASE (from "#define UTS_RELEASE
"2.2.16"" to "#define UTS_RELEASE "2.2.16-SMP"")
in /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h file .
And recompile the kernel module, then the installation is successful.
But why? What should I do now? Please help me!!
Thanks!!
