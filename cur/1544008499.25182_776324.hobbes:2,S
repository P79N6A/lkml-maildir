This is the result of CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE turned on.
When a process exits, kernel/exit.c:check_stack_usage() is called.

When firefox exits, this function is called... If you think that
check_stack_usage()
could be responsible of this hang, perhaps you can put a printk()
after its call to check it.
I don't know, it depends on when it happens.

You should first try to find a way to reproduce it..... When does it happen?
