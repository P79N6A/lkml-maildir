zz.mtest contains the full path to 3 ogg files on 3 lines, no funny
characters, the following is one of them.
$ mplayer /usr/nfs/sandbox/media/audio/_the-party-has-just-begun/Lebanese_Blonde.ogg
plays fine, as expected. however, per your test:
$ mplayer /usr/nfs/sandbox/media/audio/_the-party-has-just-begun/Lebanese_Blonde.ogg <zz.mtest

per above, the problem is reproduced with your example.

zz.mtest is just 3 ogg files like the one above in my first run. Me
throws up hands, I know it is kernel api change, me thinks Linux is not
posix anymore (per lkml followup). Big concern is not my ability to play
songs, but *complex* scripts to check spam during smtp are broke in
2.6.11 (rc?) and forward.
tmp="${scq}/`safecat "${scq}/tmp" "${scq}" </dev/stdin`" \
        || { echo "Error $?"; exit 71; } # put the pipeline to disk, if possible
        # ${scq}/tmp is a temp for this function ${scq} is temp for this program
score=`spamc -x -c <"$tmp"` # score it with spamd
sce=$?
... Who knows what else won't be working.
