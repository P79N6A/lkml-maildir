Yes, this problem requires the file to be accessed via the same file 
descriptor.  I suspect this behaviour is common for a certain class of 
applications, e.g., web servers.  However, any application that read from 
the same page repeatedly would also experience this problem.  It is more 
likely to occur with small files, but not exculsively.
