Ah right. It doesn't invalidate page_mapped() pages.
If that means it doesn't invalidate pages previously cached
by other processes, then great.
However I think what I meant though was fadvise(FADV_DONTNEED)
should only invalidate pages where page_count()<=1
From include/linux/mm.h
" For pages belonging to inodes, the page_count() is the number of
  attaches, plus 1 if `private' contains something, plus one for
  the page cache itself."
cheers,
Pádraig.
