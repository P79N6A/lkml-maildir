The changes are mostly isolated into check_link(), the fact that half
the function gets placed inside a conditional but diff sees it as a
bunch of smaller changes makes the changes look a lot more invasive than
they actually are.  I guess that could be helped by splitting the PHY
access code out of check_link() into check_phy_status() or something but
I'm not sure how much that really helps.
