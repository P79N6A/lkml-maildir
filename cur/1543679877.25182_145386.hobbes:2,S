Yes, GNU Pth :
http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/
and, for example :
http://www.xmailserver.org/libpcl.html
They use the generic POSIX stack setup described here :
http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/rse-pmt.ps
My Pine's 'd' key deleted his patch before I could take an exhaustive
look, but it should be fine though. They both do use to enter the signal
handler simply to get a snapshot of the context, and they exit the handler
by letting the kernel to clean the on-sig-stack flag. try to search
archives to take a better look at the patch ...
