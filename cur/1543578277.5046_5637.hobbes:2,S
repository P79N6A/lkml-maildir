Can you please calm down ? Just because you maybe found ONE bug you cannot 
say that there are more issues except this one without even knowing them!
If it helps, I'm using 2.2.18+reiserfs-3.5.29+ide-dma patch and I cannot 
reproduce ANYTHING said in the referred message. It works perfectly fine. 
I was using gcc 2.95.2 to compile the kernel.
