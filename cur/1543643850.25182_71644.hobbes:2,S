Looks sane, thanks.
It appears that MAP_LOCKED is a Linux-special, so presumably it
_used_ to work.  I wonder when it broke?
You patch applies to 2.4 as well; it would be useful to give that
a sanity test and send a copy to Marcelo.
(SuS really only anticipates that mmap needs to look at prior mlocks
in force against the address range.  It also says
     Process memory locking does apply to shared memory regions,
and we don't do that either.  I think we should; can't see why SuS
requires this.)
