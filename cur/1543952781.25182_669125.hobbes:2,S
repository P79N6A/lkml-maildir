Yes, but it's damage is already done.

Not sure to which part of the above paragraph you refer here. The
timeout is defined by spec.

Not to mention the fact that the correct timeout will be finite, and you never know how long it will take you to load the firmware.
Good point but IMHO the timeout can got to minutes so it's converging
to infinite in this case.

This could even be done from user space in case you want to use a
standard driver.
Won't this prevent us from compiling the drivers into kernel?
Second how this possible especially with standard driver as they are
loaded. I know you can enforce module loading but how can you enforce
probing order form user space?
