The list is still around, but Dominik seems to have vanished.

That's from around the time that I handed PCMCIA over to Dominik, and was
a to-do item.  I had some drivers converted over - mainly the few that I
was using, those being serial and pcnet_cs (serial is converted over but
the patch I had for pcnet_cs is below.)
However, in spite of me pointing Dominik at my remaining patch sets several
times, as far as I could tell they got ignored.  So essentially I all lost
interest in helping out with PCMCIA.

Wrong function.  release_resource() doesn't pair with request_region().
request_region() allocates memory for the struct resource.
release_resource() merely removes the struct resource from the tree.
release_region() on the other hand removes the struct resource and
frees it.

Convert pcnet_cs and serial_cs to request their IO regions, thereby
marking them busy.  These are only two of many drivers which need this
update.
