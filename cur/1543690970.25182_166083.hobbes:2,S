Subject: [CONFIG] zlib decompression not selectable

Hi,
my problem is simple:
i have both kernel 2.4.21 and 2.4.22 and want to include "zlib 
decompression support". With "make menuconfig" i don't even see that 
option under "Library Routines" - with "make xconfig" i see it, but it 
disabled.
Na matter what i do, in the .config it always says
   CONFIG_ZLIB_INFLATE=m
which is not what i want. I can set it to "y" but as soon as i start 
xconfig or menuconfig and save the config again, it is reset to "m".
So what am i doing wrong here? Is this a bug in the config-stuff?
