  If you want more info without reading the spec, here is some more:

  But that is the recommended way to do in the ATA specification, since ATA4:
http://www.t13.org/project/d1153r18-ATA-ATAPI-4.pdf
and read "6.10 Security Mode feature set" around page 30 / page 46.
Pay attentiong to the last sentense of "6.10.4 Frozen mode".
  And some BIOS correctly implement it - most BIOS don't.

  Which setting are you talking about: freezing the HPA, the configuration
 or the password - that is different ATA commands.
 Gujin can run a kernel (or some other software) without freezing each of
 them independantly but the user has to explicitely request it - and should
 not try to boot a random CDROM with the password unfrozen.

  Some BIOS have support for password, but Gujin is not using BIOS
 services for "protection" because BIOS is not providing such services
 with a documented interface.

  The complete ATA specification is describing a register interface since ATA1,
 SATA chipsets should be software compatible, even if they add commands/interfaces:
http://www.sata-io.org/interopfaq.asp
    say:
    Are there any known interoperability issues with SATA?
    One of the primary requirements of the SATA 1.0 specification was to
    maintain backward compatibility with existing operating system drivers
    to eliminate incompatibility issues.
