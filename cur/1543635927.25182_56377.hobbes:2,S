Well for one thing it eliminates the requirement to
include SCSI interface code on machines that don't
have SCSI. That's the practical aspect.
Now, the esoteric. Do you truly think that it is
proper to encapsulate devices in various layers?
The IDE interface, if it wasn't for the bug-workarounds,
is just a floppy disk interface that uses a different
controller chip. It is register-based, not message-
based. If you throw in a message-based control layer
(SCSI), what problems are you solving? It's a
rhetorical question. No answer is required.
Like I said before, your stuff works great. I use
it because I use SCSI. Somebody needs to write some
CD access code for IDE drives because they are not
going away. Maybe that 'somebody' is not you. You
certainly don't want to mess up good working code.
But I, for one, would feel a bit better about the
future IDE/CDROM code if you wrote it.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
