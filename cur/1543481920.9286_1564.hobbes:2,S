I haven't been able to clearly reproduce this yet.  Most of the times, it
Just Doesn't Happen while tcpdump is running (or stops immediately, or
tcpdump doesn't display anything while the "activity" LED on the Ethernet
hub is flickering wildly), once I was able to see a kind of ACK storm on
the LAN that I don't really understand:

This belongs to an ongoing SSH connection from the SCO Unix 3.2v4.2
machine (193.174.156.65) to the Linux 2.2.0-pre9 box (193.174.156.69), 
and it stopped immediately upon sending a "ping" Linux -> SCO.
This was NOT the effect observed previously (the ACKs have been visible
on a third machine on the LAN, not as "corrupted packets").
I'll send more traces as soon as I'm able to reproduce the problem with
meaningful results.
