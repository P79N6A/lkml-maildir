I think the best thing is to do it in user space, and there is no need to do
it in ifconfig since this is unecessary bloat, just use:
<quoting www.freefire.org>
+ [tgz] arping in ip-utils by Alexey Kuznetsov can send
            arp-pings, unsolicited and gratious arp, it can also detect
            ip address collisions
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/iputils-current.tar.gz
Just call it that way: "arping -D -I eth0 <ip of ether 0>". It will exit
immediatelly if it receives an Answer from another host. You can also run
arpwatch, of course.
Greetings
Bernd
