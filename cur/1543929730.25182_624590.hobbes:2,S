My patch was very wrong, but at least I produced a test case. It fails
on all systems I could test. The only correct solution (TM) could be
achieved if we could tell the tracee in ptrace_stop() that the tracer
actually died and it should use nostop_code instead of exit_code.
Possibly a new flag?

 * This program tests what happens when the tracer goes away while

 *
 * A successful run should produce output like this:
 *
 * Started child 4206
 * Attached process 4206
 * 
 * OK
 * Parent terminated with exit code 0
 *
 * A failed run looks like this:
 *
 * Started child 4318
 * Attached process 4318
 * Parent terminated with exit code 0
 * Child died unexpectedly
 *
 * The exit status is:
 *   0 (TEST_OK)	success
 *   1 (TEST_FAILED)	the test failed
 *   2 (TEST_ABORTED)	unexpected failure prevented the test
 *			to be performed
