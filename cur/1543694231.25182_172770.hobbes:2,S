A system of mine just started producint this:
2003-10-15 07:00:19 kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can\'t update from 59 to 0
Apparant Cause :
potential problem in the hardware's real time clock (at least, as far as I
can tell from the messags.  The kernel is trying to update the hardware
clock with the correct time and getting errors)
I haven't been able to find much else yet.  Any chance this could be
caused by a dead/dying motherboard battery or is it likely the timeclock
is dying?  This should be a Tyan 2466 motherboard and one of about 50
identicle systems out in production and the only one producing this
error.
Thanks,
  Robert
:wq!
