You still need to find VMA in one loop, and run through it's(mm_structu) pages in
second loop.

It looks so.
My test pseudocode is following:
fget_light();
igrab();
kzalloc(number_of_pages * sizeof(void *));
get_user_pages(number_of_pages);
... undo ...
I've attached two graphs of performance with and without
get_user_pages(), it is get_user_pages.png and kmalloc.png.
Vertical axis is number of Mbytes per second thrown through above code,
horizontal one is number of pages in each run.
