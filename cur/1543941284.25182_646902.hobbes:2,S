I found a statement on a web page that the ERL2 implementation is not
included in the GPL version (
http://zaal.org/iscsi/index.html
). The
above implies that this statement is incorrect. Tomo, are you the
maintainer of this web page ?
I'll try to measure the performance of the LIO Target Stack on the
same setup on which I ran the other performance tests.
