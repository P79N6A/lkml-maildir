Normally yes.. but that may be a sacrifice that may have to be made 
considering what ndiswrapper is doing - inserting blobs of code into the 
kernel that were never designed to run there. I would think that would 
be something you would want to do with such a driver regardless of stack 
switching - do we have any way of knowing whether the Windows driver is 
doing some timing-dependent thing that will cause bad things to happen 
if we take away the CPU from it in the middle?
