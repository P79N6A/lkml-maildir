That's the problem - if the CPU is failing and you have to remove
it the task will likely corrupt its data or fail in other ways
if it doesn't allow it.
Better to let RT tasks run a little slower on another CPU.

If its CPU fails much worse things than that will happen.
One way might be to break affinity of all processes in the system on hot unplug
- then your deadlock would be avoided - but it might be a bit radical.
