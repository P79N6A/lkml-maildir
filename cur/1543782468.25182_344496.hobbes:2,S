Well that's not quite correct, changes were made that allow lookup of
the cic from another task. What happens is that process A will be
dirtying lots of data and process B will be quitely reading other data.
Process B can then get unlucky and have to do page reclaim on behalf of
process A, simply because it tries to allocate a page under memory
pressure.
This is probably fairly rare, because async writeout goes to a dedicated
queue typically bound to one (or more) of the pdflush threads which
never exit. None the less, it needs fixing.
This used to be safe (it used rcu and the cfq_cic_lock to protect read
and write side respectively), I _think_ this was dropped at some point
because I dropped the cross-lookup. I have to ponder how best to fix
this...
