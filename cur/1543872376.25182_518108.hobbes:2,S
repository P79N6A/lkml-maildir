Hot Damn! I did my test compiles with gcc 3.3, and you obviously compiled 
with gcc 4.1 - I only got a warning where you got an error, and that 
warning escaped me. Sorry about that.
I fixed the error and all warnings and will post a fresh set of patches 
right after this reply. If you could give the new patch another go and ack 
it if it works, I would be delighted! =)
Thanks for pointing this out!
