Mmm. Let me see. I think I prefer this one! :-)

If you have a significant legacy of use of earlier versions, I guess
this makes sense. However, given the experimental nature of this support
(it will be a while before the user space support for this is
secure/robust), I'm not all that concerned about legacy support.

Ugh. I don't like this. It presumes that the kernel will get more and
more complicated over time. Please don't do this one.

While asserting that it is more flexible etc., no one has yet actually
given an example of where fE being richer than a simple binary helps
anything. Until I see an example, I'm going to hold the position that
this is needless "complexity".
