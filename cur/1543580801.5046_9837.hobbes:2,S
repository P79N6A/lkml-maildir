Hi guys, 
 I guess I'm doing something stupid, so please can somebody point it out
and put me out of my misery ?
 Copied a plain 2.4.0 tree to a new directory, patched it to 2.4.1 without
any errors. Then I realised it had all the object files from my last
compile, so I thought "make mrproper" was called for. It did a little,
then
rm: include/asm: is a directory
make: *** [mrproper] Error 1
"make clean" and "make oldconfig" stop with similar errors, "make
clean" is in "symlinks" at the time.
This piece of makefile looks to be the same as in 2.4.0, which worked.
I'm running make 3.77.
Any comments, please ?
Ken
