Nope.  It just means that __generic_file_aio_write_nolock() doesn't take
the lock.  We don't assume or require that the caller took it.  For example
the raw driver calls generic_file_aio_write_nolock() without taking
i_mutex.  Raw isn't relevant to the problem (although ocfs2 might be).  But
we cannot assume that all callers have taken i_mutex, I think.
I guess we can make that a rule (document it, add
BUG_ON(!mutex_is_locked(..)) if it isn't a blockdev) if needs be.  After
really checking that this matches reality for all callers.
It's important, too - if we have an unprotected i_size_write() then the
seqlock can get out of sync due to a race and then i_size_read() locks up
the kernel.
