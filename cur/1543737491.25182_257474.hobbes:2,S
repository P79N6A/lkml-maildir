Note though that they will have to send you the kernel sources (or
point to the version they used) and compiled in modifications.
If their code is user-space then they don't have to send you their code,
provided that it isn't using any other user-space gpl code.
There is not problem with user-space proprietary code, as long as it
isn't derived work of other GPL user-space code.
Note that there is a debate whether closed-source kernel modules are
breaking the GPL (not linked in modification), and Linus state a few
times he won't act against such things (ati and nvidia distribute
closed source kernel modules).
Also with user-space, most libraries are lgpl or similar, and even if
not, its not always clear when dynamic linking is in violation of the
GPL (IANAL but my guess is that when there are alternatives that would
work without big modifications that its not, since its not derived work
in such a case).
