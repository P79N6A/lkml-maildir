Here are the results of my testing to try to determine when in the 2.3
series the dbench benchmark troubles started.
First my hardware:
P2/400, 256meg RAM, 10gig WDC AC310100B IDE HD.
I'm running dbench with 16 clients.  Here are my results:
2.2.14 (for reference)
Throughput 14.7822 MB/sec (NB=18.4778 MB/sec  147.822 MBit/sec)
Throughput 13.1265 MB/sec (NB=16.4081 MB/sec  131.265 MBit/sec)
Throughput 15.4812 MB/sec (NB=19.3515 MB/sec  154.812 MBit/sec)
2.2.14 + Andrea's elevator 4 patch (again for reference)
Throughput 8.83695 MB/sec (NB=11.0462 MB/sec  88.3695 MBit/sec)
Throughput 9.39707 MB/sec (NB=11.7463 MB/sec  93.9707 MBit/sec)
Throughput 8.97566 MB/sec (NB=11.2196 MB/sec  89.7566 MBit/sec)
2.3.41
Throughput 15.707 MB/sec (NB=19.6338 MB/sec  157.07 MBit/sec)
2.3.42
Throughput 16.4416 MB/sec (NB=20.552 MB/sec  164.416 MBit/sec)
Throughput 15.5771 MB/sec (NB=19.4713 MB/sec  155.771 MBit/sec)
2.3.43
Throughput 4.2258 MB/sec (NB=5.28225 MB/sec  42.258 MBit/sec)
Throughput 4.07625 MB/sec (NB=5.09532 MB/sec  40.7625 MBit/sec)
2.3.44
Throughput 4.39419 MB/sec (NB=5.49274 MB/sec  43.9419 MBit/sec)
2.3.45
Throughput 4.56903 MB/sec (NB=5.71129 MB/sec  45.6903 MBit/sec
2.3.47
Throughput 3.87903 MB/sec (NB=4.84878 MB/sec  38.7903 MBit/sec)
So the problems definetly started after 2.3.43.  Of course, it happens to
be the biggest patch in ages: 4megs.  I am not a hacker myself, just a
tester ;) (compiled about 10 kernels tonight...) but it seems it cannot be
a SMP problem because I do not have SMP.  Secondly, it appears that
andreas elevator work might be hurting performance alittle, but from the
work I just did it seems only a small part of the problem?
My config for 2.3.42 is at the bottom of the mail.  A diff to the 2.3.43
config (generated with make oldconfig) is also attached.
I trust some use can be made with this info :) If you have any other
things for me try, please send along your patches and I'll give em a shot.
