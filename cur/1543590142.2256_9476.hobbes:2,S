Ok, so we have $(VERSION).$(MINOR).$(PATCHLEVEL)$(EXTRAVERSION)$(USERVERSION).
Isn't this the same as $(VERSION).$(MINOR).$(PATCHLEVEL)$(EXTRAVERSION) where
$(EXTRAVERSION) has $(USERVERSION) appended?
In other words:
EXTRAVERSION=-ac4-build1
You can extend EXTRAVERSION infinitely, but after the first 10 or so
characters, it starts to get silly.
