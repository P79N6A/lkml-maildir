I may want to _strip_ shellscripts of power. 
The ELF notes way doesn't allow that.
I may want to give special power to certain Javascripts (assuming I'd ever
trust the java engine itself). I do _not_ consider it acceptable to give
all powers to the java interpreter in general, but I _do_ consider it
acceptable to give special capabilities to certain scripts.
The ELF notes way doesn't allow that.
I may have anoter safe scripting language. Perl comes to mind. And I may
want to have scripts that have special privileges, installed to do system
administration.
The ELF notes way doesn't allow that.
Do you start to see a pattern here now? It's not about ELF. It's about
everything ELSE. It's about doing something right, and not getting stuck
with a bad decision forever.
