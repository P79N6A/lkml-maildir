Subject: file size rlimit inhibits kernel process accounting

Consider a file size ulimit/rlimit, set using something like:
    ulimit -f 1000  # kilobytes of output files
All processes run from the above shell will be unable to write their
accounting file records (enabled with accton) if the size of the
accounting file is larger than the given file size limit.
This seems unintended.  In fact, an intruder could purposefully set
a low file size limit to prevent process accounting and cover his/her
traces in the accounting log.  (Or, someone could do it to avoid being
charged for system usage, etc.)
Same behaviour: 2.2.19 and 2.4.18-pre7
