Another thing. What you mention above is really just having a set of owners
for the read side and not really a preemption list tracking thing with RCU
and special scheduler path. The more RCU does this kind of thing the more
it's just like a traditional read/write lock but with more parallelism since
it's holding on to read side owners on a per CPU basis.
This was close to the idea I had for extending read/write locks to be more
parallel friendly for live CPUs, per CPU owner bins on individual cache lines
(I'll clarify if somebody asks), but the use of read/write locks is seldom
and in non-critical places, so just moving the code fully to RCU would be a
better solution. The biggest problem is to scan or denote to some central
structure (task struct, lock struct) when you were either in or out of the
reader section without costly atomic operations. That's a really huge cost
as you know already (OLS slides).
