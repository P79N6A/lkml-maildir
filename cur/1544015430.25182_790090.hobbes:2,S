Hi,
I started to write some testcases for register_blkdev(), see
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4969BE28.2030303
%40freemail.hu&forum_name=ltp-list .
I am not sure how register_blkdev() should work, so I tried to
write down what I could find out so far, but there are still some open
questions.
Could you please review and correct the following description?
