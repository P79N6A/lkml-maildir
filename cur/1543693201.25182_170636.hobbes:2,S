Not sure about this but I think the problem might lie in ircomm_tty_write:
        spin_lock_irqsave(&self->spinlock, flags);
...
                /* Copy data */
                if (from_user)
                        copy_from_user(skb_put(skb,size), buf+len, size);
                else
                        memcpy(skb_put(skb,size), buf+len, size);
...
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&self->spinlock, flags);
asm/uaccess.h:498 is might_sleep() in copy_from_user() in my tree so this
might be it. No fix though, I just noticed this bug some time ago and
completly forgot about it until now.
