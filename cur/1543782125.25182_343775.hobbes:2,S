_validate() is mostly needed when we take a timeout specification from
user space (timeouts from kernel space are supposed to be ok). We need
to validate that the clock id passed is correct (existant), that
the 'struct timespec' is also legal (eg: nsec < 1000M), that the flags 
are ok (relative/absolute), etc...
The idea is that in your code that uses this, once you copy the 'struct 
timeout' from  user space you check it for validity. Then you can 
dive into any kind of code (atomic, sleep paths, whatever) without
having
to code an error path from deeep down for when the user passed a bad 
timeout.
It sure makes it more simple :)
