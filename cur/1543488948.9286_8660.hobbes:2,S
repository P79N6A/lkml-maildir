I can't comment on the first of those two assumptions as I've no
specific information on it, other than that all of the implementations
I'm aware of follow it. However, I can make the following observations
regarding the second assumption:
 1. In MS-DOS 1.xx filenames were padded with spaces, but extensions
    were inconsistantly padded as follows:
     1. If the entire extension was unused, three spaces were used
        to fill the field.
     2. If at least one character was used, the field was padded with
        NUL (zero) bytes rather than spaces.
 2. According to MicroSoft's own documentation, from MS-DOS 2.00 the
    file system would always pad both fields with spaces where
    required.
I'll agree that systems running MS-DOS 1.xx are probably not in the
majority, but that's the only variation from that specification that I
am aware of...
Best wishes from Riley.
