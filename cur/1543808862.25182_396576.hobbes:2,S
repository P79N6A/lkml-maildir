I don't fully agree with the interval behaviour either, but here one could 
at least say it's correct on average. Since hrtimer is also used for 
nanosleep(), which I consider more important (as e.g. posix timer), this 
one should at least be correct and consistent with previous 2.6 releases. 
I don't mind fixing it properly, but just omitting the rounding here is 
simply not correct.
bye, Roman
