Subject: [PATCH 1/2] mpt fusion: updated mpt drivers from lsi upstream "4.00.43.00"

Occasionally I'm working with LSI SAS 1068E controllers on 2.6.26.2 kernel,
it has a nasty bug that some hotplugged disks cannot be auto discovered,
the detailed description is on bugzilla.kernel:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12163
After some inspecting the vendor's website, I found there are "4.00.43.00"
drivers for RHEL5.1, but the drivers in main stream kernel are still "3.04.07",
and the changelogs of "4.00.43.00" have records on solving that BUG,
but the default "4.00.43.00" downloaded from lsi.com cannot even build on
kernel-2.6.26.2, and after some work, I get it run on 2.6.26.2, then can build
with mainstream git kernel (the HEAD currently),
http://www.lsi.com/storage_home/products_home/standard_product_ics/sas_ics/lsisas1068e/index.html
   -#define MPT_LINUX_VERSION_COMMON	"3.04.07"
   +#define MPT_LINUX_VERSION_COMMON	"4.00.43.00"
This patch is just the upstream "4.00.43.00", it's very big, about 130K after
bzip2'ed, so I upload it to bugzilla.kernel, can now be downloaded from
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=19155
You can also download the tarball from the vendor's website and
extract them into drivers/, instead of applying this patch.
the next one is the adjusting for mainstream git kernel.
