That's not really right.
There are two functions: get_page_state() and get_full_page_state(). 
get_page_state() only gets those fields up to and including
GET_PAGE_STATE_LAST.  The way you have the code laid out there implies that
get_page_state() also calculates the total nr_bounce, only it doesn't.
I'll fix it up.
