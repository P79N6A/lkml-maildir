In trying to recompile test5-mm2, I discovered that I have a file in a
wierd state where the system hangs while trying to access it... 
Here's the output of 'strace -f' and the gcc command that causes it to
lock.......
[pid  3416] write(3, ".byte 0x05\n        .asciz \"dma_c"..., 4096) = 4096
[pid  3416] brk(0)                      = 0x80a4000
[pid  3416] brk(0x80a6000)              = 0x80a6000
[pid  3416] open("./..tmp_kallsyms1.o.d", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666
then freezes.  I can kill strace, but not cpp0.
I also tried 'less ./..tmp_kallsyms1.o.d' and it locked..
root      3475  0.0  0.3  3820  728 pts/1    D    07:17   0:00 less ./..tmp_kallsyms1.o.d
root      3402  0.0  0.5  4164 1228 pts/1    D    07:12   0:00 /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.2/cpp0 -lang-a
I'll revert to test-4 to verify that I do not have this problem there.
If anyone wants more info or for me to run some tests, please feel free
to email me.
