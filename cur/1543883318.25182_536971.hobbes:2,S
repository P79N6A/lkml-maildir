it would be great if you could try a simple experiment: does something 
as simple as glxgears resized to a large window trigger this 
'stuttering' phenomenon when other stuff is running? If not, could you 
try to find the simplest 3D stuff under Linux that already triggers it 
so that i can reproduce it?
(Also, as an independent debug-test, could you try CONFIG_PREEMPT too 
perhaps? I.e. is this 'stuttering' behavior independent of the 
preemption model and a general property of CFS?)
