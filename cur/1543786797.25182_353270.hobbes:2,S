Yep, probably just some timing or cache anomaly, generally just
sum the user and system time in the case where you are running
identical userspace code... I wouldn't worry too much about it.

I wouldn't say stupid. Implementation was too complex, but some
clever ideas were required to solve the problems you identified.
There are definitely a couple of possible places where a brsem
may be useful, and I think cpucontrol semaphore is one of those.
Al can probably comment on its use in the superblock. It seems
fair enough, though I think we'll want to slim down my naive
rwsem array and maybe think about using alloc_percpu.
Is the remount case much rarer than mount/unmount? Do we need to
be careful about bloating the size of the superblock on large
machines? In that case maybe a global remount brsem will be
enough to handle this race?
