BS. Mac OS X does not use the X11 window system. That's where the fun lies.
If a company decides to release an application for Linux they will either
rewrite it using Motif (ugh) or use a modern window tool kit like GTK or
QT. Or even (horrors) use some sort of Windows Compatibility Library like
WINE or WxWindows. 
But you can't compile a MacOS X application on Linux. You're missing all of
the necessary display libraries and infrastructure.
