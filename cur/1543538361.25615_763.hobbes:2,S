I've just taken a timeout from my temporary braindamage!
As you say, sock_alloc is not the right place. But I don't 
see any way other than specifically checking if it is a
local or non-local socket. The attached patch moves it 
into sock_create (and removes some of the other
braindamage too). It's much nicer (patch attached).
The thing that puzzles me, is that you don't think it's a bug.
It is of course root that eg. owns an rlogin connection, but
shouldn't identd and netstat have the possibility of reporting 
the users uid somehow? The identd in particular.
PS: Are you thinking about fchown as something an suid-root 
application should do?
