Subject: [2.6.6-rc1-bk1][SMBUS/I2C PIIX4] - SMBus hangs during high CPU temperature report - Bug in SMBus driver or buggy hardware (IBM)?

After managing to get the lm80 sensor chip working on my IBM 300PL 6892-N2U
machine, I've reached problems with the SMBus hanging and not being able to
reset.
Below is some extra debugging I've added to try and force reset, then kill
the bus but it seems to be ignoring the requests. Is there a particular
reason the i2c-piix4 driver initially disables the SMBus aside from any
possible EEPROM corruption (not observed on this board, different Atmel
chip).
It would be great if someone from IBM could tell me if the SMBus on the
board is buggy. If I do a warm reboot, the bus returns to normal function.
I'm confused as why its not resetting or killing transactions on the bus
(perhaps my code is wrong?)

                        "waiting... \n", temp);
                do {
                        i2c_delay(1);
                        temp = inb_p(SMBHSTSTS);

                        if (temp & 0x04) goto reset;
                } while ((temp & 0x01) && (timeout++ < MAX_TIMEOUT));
