LOL... Ain't that the truth?  :)
As far as the swearing in the kernel... who really cares?  I mean,
Microsoft and many other companies have this exact type of language in
THEIR source.  No one's made a deal about that.
Hell, I've even seen some programs that have had curse words in dialogs.
Anyway... what matters is that Linux is an operating system, and it works.
Thing is, Linux is taking the rap because it's "OPEN SOURCE," something
which Microsoft is not.  Therefore, the playing field as always is unfair
and tipped towards those who appear saintly to the customers.
Thing is that Microsoft fucks people over every day.  I see this in my
technician position.  But, I haven't had a single client make any
complaints about Linux after they've read a book or two on it.  In fact,
I hear about how great Linux is for them, and how things are going so well
because the downtime has greatly decreased for some "unknown" reason <G>.
In any case, the so-called profanity can leave itself there.  Who really
cares?
