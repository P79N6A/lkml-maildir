That's a bit strange as one of the first things done in 3c59x ISR is:
if ((status & IntLatch) == 0)
         goto handler_exit;  /* No interrupt: shared IRQs can cause this */
with which the driver detects if the interrupt was generated by the card.
Are you sure the driver for the other PCI device knows to play nice with
shared interrupts ?
