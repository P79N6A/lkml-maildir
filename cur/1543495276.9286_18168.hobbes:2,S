Speeking for the ncr/sym53c8xx drivers, there is no problems to 
add some poll for completion behaviour code. The problem is just 
to add some path that tells the driver to behave so.
By the way, it should not be different for other SCSI drivers.
Should not exceed 20 lines of code in ncr/sym53c8xx drivers.
