Hello sir,
       I successfully added linked list data structure
  in kernel in header file. Write a C source file and
add it to kernel directory. then write 2 system calls
that read and write to linked list from user space
through that syscalls. 
       recompile kernel. Now able to read/write that
linked list.
       I want to write user data in that linked list
and allow kernel to use that info in linked list. Is
my approach to send data from user to kernel  and
store there as long as OS is not rebooted is right?
 Please reply me.
Thanks in advance.
regards,
linux_lover.
