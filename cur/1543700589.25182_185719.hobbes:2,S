Not sure what else to try. I see that you've already posted to the ata-raid
list, so I'd hope that somebody else would reply from there. The pdcraid driver
has not received much attention lately, so it may very well be broken for your
configuration. Promise has released a binary/source combo driver similar to
Nvidia's that will still work in 2.4 - you might give that a try. I have a
PDC20276 based onboard raid setup, however, I use 2.6 with device mapper to use
it. It's a bit of a pain to setup ATM - especially if you want to boot from it,
but it can be done. Good luck,
-Walt
