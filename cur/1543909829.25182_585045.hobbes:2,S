Subject: [PATCH 000 of 2] md: bug fixes for 2.6.23-rc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following 2 patches contain bugfixes for md.  Both apply to earlier
kernels, but probably aren't significant enough for -stable (no oops,
no data corruption, no security hole).
They should go in 2.6.23 though.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
