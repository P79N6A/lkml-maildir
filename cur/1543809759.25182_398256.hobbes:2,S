It sure is :P

I think I can do a better interposer, then. I can interpose both the 
ptrace and the wait functions so that I can keep an internal "is being 
single stepped" state for each process being ptrace'd.

If I understand this correctly, if the kernel had some other way of 
producing a single step (a new flag on newer processors, a timer 
interrupt going on after one cycle, whatever) it might not even set the 
trap flag at all, and still execute perfectly well the ptrace syscalls, 
with all the expected signals being generated, etc.
So this is very much implementation dependent, and the application 
should not rely on internal kernel mechanisms like that...

The patch wasn't meant to be used like that. It was just to show what 
was needed to make the debugger happy.
At the very least, the patch needs a lot more comments and a quarantine 
on -mm before it can be used on mainline.

The interposer is the closest thing we have to "fixing kylix". I think 
most kylix users will be perfectly happy with the interposer and we 
really don't need to change the kernel. They are already used to work 
around problems that arise from the total staleness of the project.
I'll try to send a few posts to Kylix forums with the interposer thing 
and see how well it is accepted.
 From what I've heard, Borland is selling its languages, including 
Delphi and Kylix, so maybe the company that buys it will be more willing 
to properly maintain kylix in the future :)
