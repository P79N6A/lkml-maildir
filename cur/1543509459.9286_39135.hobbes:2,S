Subject: International fonts not working good with 2.2.x ( RH6.0 / i386 ) console

I tried to set up slovenian support on two redhat 6.0/i386 systems,
but no success.
When I set the screen font with consolechars, it is set only
for the current VT, and it is also reset when I log out or run
/usr/bin/reset.
Were there some important changes in the console code ?
It worked ok on 2.0.x based systems ( and older too ).
