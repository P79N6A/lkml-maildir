From my POV, we started with the problem of how to provide atomic
access to a multi-page block in the page cache. For example, we want
to lock the filesystem block and prevent any updates to it, so we
need to lock all the pages in it. And then when we write them back,
they all need to change state at the same time, and they all need to
have their radix tree tags changed at the same time, the problem of
mapping them to disk, getting writeback to do block aligned and
sized writeback chunks, and so on.
And then there's the problem that most hardware is limited to 128
s/g entries and that means 128 non-contiguous pages in memory is the
maximum I/O size we can issue to these devices. We have RAID arrays
that go twice as fast if we can send them 1MB I/Os instead of 512k
I/Os and that means we need contiguous pages to be handled to the
devices....
All of these things require some aggregating structure to
co-ordinate. In times gone by on other OSs, this has been done with
a buffer cache, but Linux got rid of that long ago and we don't want
to reintroduce one. We can't use buffer heads - they can only point
to one page. So what do we do?
That's where compound pages are so nice - they solve all of these
problems with only a very small amount of code perturbation and they
don't change any algorithms or fundamental design of the OS at all.
We don't have to rewrite filesystems to support this. We don't have
to redesign the VM to support this. We don't have to do very much
work to the block layer and drivers to make this work.
FWIW, if you want 32 bit machines to support larger than 16TB
devices, you need high order page indexing in the page cache....

Compared to a method that requires almost no change to the
filesystems that want to support large block sizes?

And what do we do for arches that can't do multiple page sizes, only
only have a limited and mostly useless set of page sizes to choose
from?
