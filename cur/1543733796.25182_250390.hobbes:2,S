I2O defines cache flush very losely. It flushes the cache and returns
when the cache has been flushed. From playing with the controllers I
have it seems some at least merge further queued writes into the output
stream. Thus if I issue
write 1, 2, 3, 4 , 40, 41, flush cache, write 5, 6, 100
it'll write 1,2,3,4,5,6, 40, 41, report flush cache complete. 
Obviously I can implement full barrier semantics in the driver if need
be but that would cost performance hence the question.
