It's really cute.

My code just looks small.  At -O2 it expands to 4 times the size of the 
existing fls and 5 times at -O3.  The saving grace is that, being faster, it 
doesn't have to be inline, saving code size overall.

The overall trend seems to be that my version is faster with newer compilers 
and higher optimization levels, and overall, the newer compilers are 
producing faster code.  The big anomally is where the original version turns 
in the best time of the lot, running on PIV, compiled at -O3 with 2.95.3, as 
you pointed out.
Well, it raises interesting questions, but I'm not entirely sure what they are 
;-)

Daniel
