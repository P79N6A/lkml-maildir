In fact this -pre4 works only after reverting the changes to Config.in,
 Makefile and serial_cb.c in drivers/char/pcmcia, otherwise my Xircom
 modem wouldn't be seen (tulip Ethernet is okay). -pre2 is fine.
So - was there any announcement about something like serial_cs engulfing
 serial_cb or is it just a bad patch that slipped in ?
Thanks & ciao,
