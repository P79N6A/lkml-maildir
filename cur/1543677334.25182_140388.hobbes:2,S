Thanks.  I've turned the 20030603.tar.gz file into a patch and added it to
the updates patch I host to allow people a single point to download errata
for the 2.4.21 kernel.
Unfortunately I have never used BK nor have I any intention at this point,
so I hope the tar ball will reflect the same information.  I have included a
pointer to the SRC directory for people to follow as well.
