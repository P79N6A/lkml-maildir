I think they *should* have separate permissions.
Also it should be possible to have file with 2 hardlinks cowlinked
somewhere, and possibly make more hardlinks of that one... Having
pointer to another inode in place where direct block pointers normally
are should be enough (thinking ext2 here).

Why, btw?
Lets say we allocate 4 bits instead of one for block bitmap. Count
"15" is special, now it means "15 or higher". That means we have to
"garbage-collect" to free space that used to have more than 15 links,
but that should not happen too often...
