Definitely agree here, waitfd() doesn't need WNOHANG - we already have
ONONBLOCK.
That also solves one of the strangest behaves of waitid when you use
WNOHANG (it returns zero and you have to check whether it changed the
struct), now you just read() - if no child you get EAGAIN, if a child
you read a struct.
