Right, agreed.
I guess one last option (which is made hard by chip label non-uniqueness
but I'll throw out anyway) would be
/sys/class/gpio
	/chipa
		/gpio-n
			/value
			/direction
		/control
	/chipb
		:
		:
I guess this doesn't gain much over labelling files chipname:N (and has
the same pitfalls) but does at least seem less hackish.
