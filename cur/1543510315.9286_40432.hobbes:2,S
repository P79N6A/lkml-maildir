There is another standard on the horizon called PCI-X that will be 133Mhz
and 64bit. The NGIO/Future IO people also promise hugely fast
interconnects.

PCI-X will have one slot :> There are ways to extend this with signal
boosting and other tricks though.. For instance you gan get >5 slot PCI
back planes without a bridge chip. I think the plan to get more slots is
to basically have a switching chip that can handle multiple busses at
once.
July's issue of RTC had a nice set of articles on PCI past, present and
future, very interesting.
