issue seems to partly solved. the e1000 driver seems to be ok!
i reconfigured my kernel and intentionally left out netfilter options. 
after that my network performance was back to normal.
netfilter was only compiled in the kernel. it was not used with any rules!
so my wild guess would be that something with the netfilter code (i am 
not 100% sure it was netfilter.. _maybe_ it was some small odd kernel 
option i accidently enabled/disabled) is broken since test3 (again 
uncertified. but i firstly noticed this switching from test3 to test4).
