That is bizarre and very irritating, as at first glance it appears to
require strcmp() on every entry until _stext is set.

Overlapping the symbols was intentional, yes. The way profiling works
is that the shift passed by profile= represents a power-of-two-sized
divisor that the virtual addresses are divided by. These bins don't
respect symbol boundaries and in fact multiple functions may share them.
I choose to account a bin to all symbols whose virtual address range
overlaps it.

No global variables and no studlycaps...

Okay, now that you have a use for ->bufcnt in struct state, it may make
sense to keep it around.

It may make more sense to pass a display callback instead, particularly
if potential future usage in a library wants to render to streams that
are not stdout or cares to render to things that aren't streams. This
looks like it's against an older version... this seems to qualify as
enough interest to at least use source control.
