well... I'll volunteer to keep a 2.6.X-postY series.. this fix could be
part of that.
For me the -post series should be
* Only patches that are in later head kernels (maybe lightly touched to

* Only patches that fix something critical/important
  (where critical is of course a gray area but I'm sure a decent balance
will be found)
