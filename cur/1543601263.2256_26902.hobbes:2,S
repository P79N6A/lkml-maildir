Is that the best approach?  Userspace doesn't always handle EIO well, but 
it can't do much worse than a permanent deadlock.

Let me rephrase: cleanish.  At least enough to let 'shutdown' actually 
shutdown and surviving filesystems to unmount cleanly.  I guess this would 
require all file ops to that filesystem to return EIO and umount would 
drop the filesystem as-is.
