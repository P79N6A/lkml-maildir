Be nice if those that get listed and have real spammer problems actually
clean up.  Some don't care.

Personally, I use several RBLs, spamhaus and spamcop being 2 of those.
If it's possible, one suggesting I have is to filter out some HELO strings.
I have 3 of those in my suggestion:
1) strings consisting of either the IP or the hostname of the receiving
server (vger.kernel.org I assume)
2) any helo that does not contain a dot.  I do not know the impact on the
list if that were used
3) tom.com and 163.com.  I have noticed that these are very common in some
of the spam on the list and others that I am on.
These are only suggestions and I do not expect anyone to blindly use them. 
I do use these methods and others, however, I am the only user of the mail
server in which I'm sending this email.
