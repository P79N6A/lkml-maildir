90%+ of that part of the fedora specfile was Arjan's doings,
myself, dwmw2 and Jarod Wilson have poked at it since then,
but in mostly minor ways.
FWIW, I'd love to see this become a generic upstream target that
I could just use in the Fedora specfile.
The question I have is whether other distros do anything differently
that might be worth taking into consideration?
