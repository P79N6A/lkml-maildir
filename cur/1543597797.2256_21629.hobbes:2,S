This is a serious bug in many user-space drivers. PS/2 mouse protocol
was designed to easily re-synchronize (think about transmission errors/
lost bytes).

This is a bug in all user-space drivers (understandable as the
kernel tried to be too clever). They must send the proper ps2-enabling
sequence after they see "aa 00".

Add an "ioctl(PS2_TRANSPARENT)", to disable the current kernel policy.
So new drivers which understand about "aa 00" sequences can act properly.
Don't break existing apps.
