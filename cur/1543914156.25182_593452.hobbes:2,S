Really?
It shouldn't. The use of kernel_termios_to_user_termios_1() is conditional 
on the architecture having a define for TCGETS2, and I think they match 
up. I see:
	[torvalds@woody linux]$ git grep -l kernel_termios_to_user_termios_1 include | wc -l
	10
	[torvalds@woody linux]$ git grep -l TCGETS2 include | wc -l
	10
and in neither case is ppc in that list of architecures.
So maybe you just read the patch without actually testing whether it 
actually broke powerpc?
Or is something subtler going on?
