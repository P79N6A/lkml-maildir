On my x86_64 machine, I got the following message
in log (kern = 2.6.23.14)
Jan 16 04:08:38 Astara kernel: BUG: MAX_LOCK_DEPTH too low!
Jan 16 04:08:38 Astara kernel: turning off the locking correctness 
validator.
Have no idea what caused it as I found the message on my console
somewhat after the fact.  The system had been up over 24 hours and
is still running.  System still seems 'fine' (been up 3 days now),
so you can treat this as a "data point".
