What a strange idea. The kernel is broken.

There are also alias problems without mounted filesystems.
It is just that the kernel fails to translate blocks on hda1 into
blocks on hda or vice versa. At first sight this seems quite doable.
(Given block N on hda, walk the partition list to find the partition
it is in. When not found the block is hda's responsibility, otherwise
it now becomes block N-N0 of hda3.)
