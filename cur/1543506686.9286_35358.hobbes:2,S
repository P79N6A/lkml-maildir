Argh, a self-followup ... this is what I get for posting when I'm tired.
It just occurred to me that someone might say "we don't care if some
ioctls write an int and other ioctls write a long".  So let me get
really specific.  These counts are from kernel 2.3.14.
In 11 drivers, TIOCINQ writes an 'int' into user-space.
In  1 driver,  TIOCINQ writes a 'long' into user-space.
    (net/x25/af_x25.c).
In 12 drivers, TIOCOUTQ writes an 'int' into user-space.
In  1 driver,  TIOCOUTQ writes a 'long' into user-space.
    (net/x25/af_x25.c again).
In 20 drivers, TIOCMGET writes an 'int' into user-space.
In  6 drivers, TIOCMGET writes a  'long' into user-space.
    (drivers/char/{cyclades.c,epca.c,isicom.c,serial167.c,specialix.c)
    (drivers/sbus/char/aurora.c)
And so on.  That's what I'm talking about: not differences between ioctls,
which would be really hard to change, but differences within a single
ioctl, which is likely to hurt 64-bit user-space programs unless they
are abnormally clever or kludgy.
