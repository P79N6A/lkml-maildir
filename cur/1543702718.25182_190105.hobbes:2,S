I'd rather see different interrupt sources run on different CPUs
initially, which would help fairness a little bit, and should be
more optimal with big interrupt loads.
0:      xxx1     0      0      0
1:      0     xxx2      0      0
2:      0        0   xxx3      0
3:      0        0      0   xxx4
This would delay the need for interrupt balancing in the case where
2 or more interrupts are heavily used.
