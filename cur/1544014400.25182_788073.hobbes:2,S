Hello Hiroshi,
The patches look technically really nice.  I have a couple of stylistic
comments, though, which I'd like yours and others' comments on.
This introduces a new blocking construct, and it's not immediately
obvious in the source code.  I think introducing a technically redundant
set of braces and dropping the parens from the try construct and the
redundant pointer might look better:
	get_user_try {
		/* do stuff */
	} get_user_catch(err);
This makes it, in my opinion, much clearer that it is a new bracing
construct, and it also eliminates the need to form a pointer to "err"
(even though the compiler doesn't actually do so, it looks like it does
to the programmer.)
Also, I don't think we need double underscores for the wrapping
construct, since the get_user/__get_user (check/nocheck) etc.
distinction doesn't directly apply there.
What do you think?
