Hi,
I merged the compile-patch to test6 and included new fixes for the
netfilter problems (rusty) and for UMSDOS. I am still testing for new
regressions, but so far test6 + patch seem to compile all possible i386 
configurations. If you find that 2.4.0-test6 does not compile for you, you
can give the patch at
http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/test6/compile.diff
a shot. If it doesn't help for you, please send me your .config file and
I'll try to fix it. 
Greetings,
   Arjan van de Ven
