And why does rdma require window scaling, keep alive, nagle and other
interesting options from TCP spec?
This really looks like initial implementation of TCP in hardware - you
setup flags like doing the same using setsockopt() and then hardware
manages the flow like network stack manages TCP state machine changes.
According to draft-culley-iwarp-mpa-03.txt this layer can do a lot of
things with valid TCP flow like
   5.  The TCP sender puts the FPDUs into the TCP stream.  If the TCP
       Sender is MPA-aware, it segments the TCP stream in such a way
       that a TCP Segment boundary is also the boundary of an FPDU.  
       TCP then passes each segment to the IP layer for transmission.
Phrases like "MPA-aware TCP" rises a lot of questions - briefly saying
that hardware (even if it is called ethernet driver) can create and work
with own TCP flows potentially modified in the way it likes which is seen 
in driver. Likely such flows will not be seen by upper layers like OS 
network stack according to hardware descriptions.
Is it correct?
