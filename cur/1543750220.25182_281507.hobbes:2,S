Subject: [RFT] r8169 changes in 2.6.x

The r8169 changes which Jeff kindly hosted in -netdev are now in
2.6.10-bk1.
This release should definitely improve the buzzword compliance of
the r8169 driver as it now features tx/rx ip chechsumming, tso,
vlan, netconsole and a more complete ethtool support.
Though available in -mm, large frames support is not included in
2.6.10-bk so far. It is available on top of 2.6.10-bk1 via:
- 
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/~romieu/misc/20041228-2.6.10-bk1-r8169.c-test.patch
  (single patch)
or:
- 
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.10-bk1/r8169/patches/
  (a serie of smaller patches for review)
Large frames roughly means 7200 bytes frames at most.
Test results for regressions/improvements/stability will be welcome.
A backport is available for 2.4.x (x >= 28) at:
- 
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/~romieu/misc/20041209-2.4.28-r8169.c-test.patch

Thank you for your attention.
