Few days ago, I found an incredibly usable option in latest gcc versions.
gcc -march=k6 -mcpu=k6
I started rebuilding SRPMS with these as optflags, just to find out that
some packages don't use optflags, but use -march=`uname -m`.
So ...

What about uname -m and non-Intel processors? Is there going to be
a change? I hope we all agree that K6 is not i586 or i686.
I vote for breaking compatibility!
