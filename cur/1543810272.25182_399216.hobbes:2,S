Attached is a real hot-fix. It disables the new check entirely.
I like to learn:
1) Why IA64 is missing Elf64_Rela. Can someone drop me a copy of elf.h -
and include gcc + binutils version in the mail - thanks.
2) I also like to know if other architectures broke - so I can figure
out how to fix this.
I have tested this on X86_64/amd64 (gentoo based) only.
