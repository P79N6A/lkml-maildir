Another possibility is that he has an RTL8139 card in the machine.
There is an obscure bug in that driver that causes the card to get
a certain "backlog". One packet is transmitted for every packet 
received.
If that's the case, Jochen will see that if he starts a parallel ping
to the same machine on a different xterm, the ping-times will drop to
10s.
I haven't had time to debug this yet. (and stupid me, the machine has
gone into production :-(  )
