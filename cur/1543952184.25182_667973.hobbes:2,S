No, that allows ext3 to cheat, because ext3 does not supply any means
of flushing its cached data to disk in response to loss of line power,
and then continuing on in a "safe" mode until line power comes back.
Fix that and you will have a replacement for ramback, arguably a more
efficient one for this specialized application (it will not work for an
external ramdisk).  Until you do that, ramback is the only game in town
to get these transaction speeds together with data durability.
I have mentioned a number of times, that you _already_ rely on an
equivalent scheme to ramback if you are using a battery-backed raid
controller. Somehow, posters to this thread keep glossing over that
and going back to the sky-is-falling argument.
