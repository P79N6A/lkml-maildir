Hi,
I've uploaded a new version of the patch that allows direct I/O to
highmem memory without resorting to bouncing to lower memory. Changes
since last time include:
- Update to 2.4.10
- Fix SCSI dont-merge error. No corruption, just a performance
  hit (me)
- Add single_sg_ok entry to SCSI hosts. An alternative solution would be
  to always bounce single entry sg for highmem pages, however I don't
  want decent drivers to take a hit on account of crap drivers. Now the
  entire I/O path should be unaffected for non-highmem enabled
  hosts/drivers. (me)
ATM only aic7xxx and sym53c8xxx have single_sg_ok enabled, others will
follow on a per-audit basis.
