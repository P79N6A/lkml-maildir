My lattest runs were with 2 days old FC development (a.k.a. "bleeding edge")
environment with  xorg-11-** of same age.  Then I noticed that these DRM
patches didn't make it into  kernel-smp-2.6.11-1.1226_FC4.i686.rpm,
and I made 2.6.12-rc2 -- just in case it had fixed the problem...
Could the card-lockups be recovered in a bit nicer way ?
(And detected, too!)
