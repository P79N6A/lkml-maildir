As far as I know the system is not overclocked (standard Digital 
Venturis 6200 GL PPro 200 Mhz machine).  It is an ISA modem.  All info I 
have on the port is as follows:
Serial driver version 5.05 (2000-12-13) with MANY_PORTS SHARE_IRQ 
SERIAL_PCI ISAPNP enabled
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
cat /proc/ioports
03f8-03ff : serial(auto)
It is a USR 56K Voice/Fax/Modem.  I am unable to find the exact model. 
It was definitely pre v.90 though I believe it has been updated 
(Firmware) to that.  I have another, though I don't remember similar 
problems even though it was at the same baudrate (different machine though).
