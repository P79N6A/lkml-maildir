More agreement. In this case it's better to commit a sin of omission
than one of commission.  In my recent cleanups, here are three cases
which were left alone:
./arch/sparc/kernel/head.S: * Sun people can't spell worth damn. "compatability" indeed.
./drivers/net/myri_sbus.h:      u32     shakedown;              /* DarkkkkStarrr Crashesss...   */
./drivers/scsi/FlashPoint.c:      return(0);  /*We WON! Yeeessss! */

Alan's humor can be subtle.  Better to ask him. AC added to cc list.
I just hope he doesn't start to pun "yn Cymraeg"
