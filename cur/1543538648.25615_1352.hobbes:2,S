Okay, first of all, the UP stuff when running with os set to other is normal. 
What kind of eepro100 card is this (chip version)? I haven't tried the eepro100
driver for a while, but the driver has been updated quite frequently lately, so
you might want to send this bug report to the maintainer Andrew Savochkin.
Have you tried any of the 2.2.x kernels? Give it a shot, I suspect eepro100 driver
issues. If your eepro works with 2.2.x you could make a hybrid kernel with one
of the eepro driver from 2.3.x (probaly later than 2.3.47).
Also be sure that you adapter is in a pci master capable slot.
I'm sure Andrew knows a lot more about this.
