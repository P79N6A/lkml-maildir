Hi all...
One good and one bad news...
The good:
Current 22-pre5 builds at -O1 level. I always thought it was mandatory to
build at -O2...At least it can be useful to detect optimizer bugs...
And the bad. The current gcc in mandrakke cooker miscompiles the kernel.
Current 2.4.22-pre5 (plain, even a comma touched) works if built with -O1
and breaks with -O2 (does not pass init launch). As it is based on
the hammer branch from SuSE, I think this also affects SuSE developers,
if not corrected in their tree yet.
Is there any way to set compile flags for _subsystems_ ? To start
a search on what breaks at -O2.
[OT] (off-topic, not Operacion Triunfo -bleh- ...)
BTW, is anybody from Mandrake reading this ? The cooker list looks dead
since a week or so. If someone reads this, plz mail me in private.
TIA
