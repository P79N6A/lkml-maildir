That's a worry if it really does that - does it, or are you just
speculating about possible problems?

It's up to the issue. For IDE it would ideally be issuing FLUSH_CACHE
repeatedly until it doesn't error anymore, but keeping track of the
error location. Come to think of it, we should pass down the range right
now to flag which range we are actually interested in being errored on.
