Just FYI, this should all be made conditional upon CONFIG_LBD so that the
majority of users who don't have/need such large files do not consume excess
space in their inodes.

Again FYI, the next limit for ext3 is 4TB for 4kB block size when you run out
of space for indirect blocks.

If you don't also fix the stat code you won't be able to stat such files.

It is usually good to include a patch with any discussion (diff -up format).
