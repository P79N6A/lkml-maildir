Possibly, it depends on the console/input developers if they want to add
something like fb_flash_logo() besides doing a kd_mksound(). Also, if
you don't mind compiling in a bunch of logo images to your kernel.
On a more practical note, the "scissors test" (I should have named this
"exclusive clipping test") can perhaps be enabled arbitrarily by
userland clients.  You'll be left with a rectangular screen space that
will not be touched by the console.  Then a distributor can do whatever
it wants with that screen estate, say an animating splash or a pop-up
window, which in theory can be triggered any time.
