Hi Martin,
Thanks for your answer.
% 2 pci.h files %
I had a look at example code that comes with libpci.a. Actually, that's 
what I had done since that's the only way I may do it.
I did not yet understand why I find two differents pci.h files, and why 
I cannot use one of them (since my compiler can't link with the lib)... 
Is there a specific way of using the second one, which I did not 
understand?
I work on RedHat 8, kernel 2.4.18-14
- pci.h No 1 is in /usr/include/pci , linked with /usr/include/linux 
 >>> the one I can use
- No 2 is in /usr/src/linux2.4.18-14/include/linux >>> the one I can't 
use, but I'd like to.
% dma support %
It should be OK like that, but my driver will have to support dma 
features... and I don't have available functions to do it, since I may 
not use pci.h file Number 2.
Do I have any other solution?
% mapping memory %
It seems I have many(?) ways for mapping memory, depending if the 
driver will be in kernel or user-space:
- I could use 'ioremap', but it seems to be designed for kernel-driver. 
And that's again the same thing, since I cannot use it. My <asm/io.h> 
file does not support it. (ugh?) I think I should find it here, as all 
documentation I found says that.
- I may use mmap too.
% kernel/user-space %
I have to develop a driver for a card designed for data-acquisition. 
The stream of data will have to be as fast as possible, since the card 
will have to support high data-rates.
What is the best, do  you think, to develop a driver. Should I do it in 
kernel or user-space? I mean, it seems that kernel accesses cost many 
CPU resources, whereas in user-space, I could have better performances 
if kernel accesses are limited...
