I got the same errors on one of my harddrives.  Let me guess...  Does it
always complain when you accessing the same specific sectors?  Does the
harddrive seem to be spending way too much time retrying?  
I had the same errors on my maxtor 2.5GB IDE HD.  I repartioned it to avoid
those sectors and that seemed to work for about three months.  Then one day
I noticed a strange noise from the box it was in: *clank* *clank* *CLANK*.
The HD died completely... :/  
Based on my experiences with similar messages, I would be extremly cautious
about using it for important data.
Anyone else have an opinion on this?
