When you say "int found;" is there any doubt in your mind that
this integer is going to hold a 1 or a 0 depending upon whether
we "found" something?
That's the problem I have with these kinds of patches, they do
not increase clarity, it's just pure mindless edits.
In new code, fine, use booleans if you want.
I would even accept that it helps to change to boolean for
arguments to functions that are global in scope.
But not for function local variables in cases like this.
