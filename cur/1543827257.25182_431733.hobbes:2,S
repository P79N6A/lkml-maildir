i have released the 2.6.17-rc6-rt3 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this is a fixes-only release: lots of fixes from Thomas Gleixner (for 
the softirq problem that caused those ping latency weirdnesses, for 
hrtimers and timers problems and for the RCU related bug that was 
causing instability and more), John Stultz, Jan Altenberg and Clark 
Williams. MIPS update from Manish Lachwani. Futex fix from Dinakar 
Guniguntala. It also includes the RT-scheduling SMP fix that could fix 
the scheduling problem reported by Darren Hart.
I think all of the regressions reported against rt1 are fixed, please 
re-report if any of them is still unfixed.
to build a 2.6.17-rc6-rt3 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.16.tar.bz2
