Ever tried:
make kernel/fork.s
and then read kernel/fork.s ?  Yes, some people who care about getting
the best out of the kernel do convert C to assembly and then read the
result.  If there's something really yucky in there, then you go back
and fix it in the C source.

"behaviour" or "style".  I prefer my style for the code I maintain, which
is close to Linus' style.  There is no current style for fixing gcc 3.x
stuff, so its up to the authors of the code to set the style.  I've
decided on one which matches the style of my multi-line macros for
consistency sake.  I'd rather not invent another style for multi-line
asm.
Sure, both "fix" the underlying problem.  But how readable is it in the
end?
BTW, your sig is being messed up by the mixture of spaces and tabs:
