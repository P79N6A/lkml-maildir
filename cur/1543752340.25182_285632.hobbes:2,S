Agreed to this complaint.  I still think it might be a good idea to
allow configuring obsolete syscalls out, but doing that on a per-syscall
basis sounds like a bad idea.  I always liked the way FreeBSD one
conditionals for everything that was obsoleted in a release.  So by setting
only few options you could select how old binaries you want to support,
defaulting to on for all of them.
