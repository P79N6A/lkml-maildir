Nope!  Inodes per group and inode blocks per group are maintained
across an online resize.  So there is no difference in inodes per
group for a filesystem created at size S1 and resized to size S2
(using either an on-line or off-line resize), and a filesystem which
is created to be size S2.
As Andreas has said, "you don't know what you are talking about."
