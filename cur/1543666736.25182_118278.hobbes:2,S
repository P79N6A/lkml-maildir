    You're also removing refcount code... why not fix it up instead?
    I agree your patch is mostly correct from a "today" standpoint,
    but from a long term standpoint ...
Your remarks have been made a few times already, and each
time I answered that my objective was to give Linux 2.6
a 32-bit dev_t, and my objective is not to do work that
is not for 2.6 but for 2.8.
Al made a brief appearance last week - if he decides to do
the character device setup now, that might change things.
If he doesnt do this then I wouldnt mind doing it,
but I suppose dev_t will keep us busy for some more time.
There is good progress on the kernel side, but we also
need some glibc fixes.
