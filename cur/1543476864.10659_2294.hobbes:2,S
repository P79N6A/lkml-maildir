Yes, this has been broken since 2.1.21 (not 121, *21*), released in
January, 1997.  I noticed it in December 1997.  Here's a reprint of
the bug report I filed with linux-kernel.  All the information in it is
still current.
Specifically, 2.1.21 changed Rules.make so that LX_OBJS and OX_OBJS
no longer get compiled with -DMODVERSIONS.  So kernel/ksyms.c never
turns on 'Using_Versions'.  Every kernel built since 2.1.21 appears
to insmod as a non-versioned kernel.
As soon as someone fixes this, two years of accumulated untested
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS funkiness will spring out.

    Subject: CONFIG_MODVERSIONS bug
    Hello kernel hackers,
    I think I've found a long-standing bug with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.
    Take a look at this paragraph from kernel/ksyms.c, 2.1.76:
	#ifdef MODVERSIONS
	const struct module_symbol __export_Using_Versions
	__attribute__((section("__ksymtab"))) = {
		1 /* Version version */, "Using_Versions"
	};
	#endif
    The problem is that MODVERSIONS is defined only when compiling *modules*.
    It's not defined when compiling kernel/ksyms.c because kernel/ksyms.c
    is part of the resident kernel.
    This construction has been in the kernel for a long time.  It's also
    in 2.1.76, 2.1.50, 2.1.32, 2.1.16, 2.0.33, and 2.0.  Back in the 2.0.XX
    kernels, Rules.make said -DMODVERSIONS for $(LX_OBJS) and $(OX_OBJS).
    But it doesn't any more.  And it probably shouldn't.  The right fix
    is probably to change MODVERSIONS above to CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.
    I have no patch for this one because I've got enough patches in progress
    already.
    How I found this: I was chasing some other potential bugs in insmod
    2.1.71 when I noticed that new_get_kernel_symbols returned 0.  Then I
    checked /proc/ksyms, and there was no "Using_Versions" there.
