Subject: [patch][ia64] Change break 0 notification string
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

At the point in traps.c where we recieve a break with a zero value, we
can not say if the break was a result of a kprobe or some other debug
facility.
This simple patch changes the informational string to a more correct
"break 0" value, and applies to the 2.6.12-rc2-mm2 tree with all the 
kprobes patches that were just recently included for the next mm cut.
