Okay, the stalls are away :) After the timeout has expired tcp_write_wakeup()
sends data (no probe 0). It uses obviously tcp_fragment() if the window
is too small.
Is it okay to start the PROBE0 timer alltough:
 - no data is pending
 - the receiver has advertised a small but non zero window ?
Is it okay that tcp_send_probe0() does always reset the PROBE0 timer 
allthough tcp_write_wakeup() might already have started the retrans
timer?
