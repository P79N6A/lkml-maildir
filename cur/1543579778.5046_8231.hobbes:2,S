eeks... a compressed archie including a binary is not what people on 
linux-kernel usually want to see....
anyway - thanks for your contribution. Why didn't you submit this for 
inclusion into netfilter/iptables CVS patch-o-matic ? We (the netfilter
people) keep all the new targets/matches/... there and submit approved
stuff after some time for inclusion to the main kernel.
I'll do some testing and put it into CVS, if you want to.
