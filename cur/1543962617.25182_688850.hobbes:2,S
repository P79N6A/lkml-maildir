That sounds good.  I once started to think about how to do this but
accidentally fell asleep.  I was thinking along the lines of the above,
only it drives an akpm script which spits out separate quilt (or git) trees
for linux-next.
The problem is that I then need to "drop" the patches so that I can merge
linux-next.  That's where I fell asleep.  I suppose that putting the
well-baked ones into a git tree and mastering them there solves the
problem.  But juggling 100-odd git branches on top of everything else
doesn't sound fun.
I need to think about this some more - it'll come.
What does "[<base>]" do?
