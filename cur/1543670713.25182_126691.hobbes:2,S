Look in the GAS source code for opcodes.
At least on the 486 and Pentium (I remember that part of GAS in those
days), it makes sense to select a register that is not set in the
preceding few instructions or used in the subsequent few.  Otherwise,
lea's use of a register adds an address generation delay (worse than
just a mov).
Hence use of %esi and %edi in GAS - registers allocated last by the
compiler, so least likely to be used/set in surrounding instructions.
The register selection is probably too difficult to automate, though.
