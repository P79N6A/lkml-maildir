ide-scsi is a bit of misleading name.
In the beginning there were only SCSI cdrom drives and proprietary cdrom 
drives.
At a certain moment the IDE cdrom drive entered the arena with the ATAPI 
interface (and still some proprietary interfaces).
The scsi drivers were written already to support cdrom devices, and they still 
contain the code to control the device correctly.
