Problem with 3com 100mbit card 3c59x:
Two machines under Linux, A and B are connected with a piece of
appropriate cable.
Machine A (2.2.0pre5) has also a second card, connecting it to a LAN.
B (2.0.36) is connected only to A though an instance of the same 3c59x
card.
When A is up and running and B is booted up, it doesn't see A until
ifdown eth0
ifup eth0
is performed on A.
Even in this case A says that 'network is unreachable'.
Nothing of what is described happens when 2.0.36 is booted on A.
