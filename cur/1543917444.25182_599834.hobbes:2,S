Hi,
I did experience a quite strange problem (at least for me) on the first
node of our 2 node cluster.
This is basically an imap/smtp/http proxy server.
One of the imapd processes started to use a lot of cpu, memory... this
morning.
Oomkiller showed up and killed slapd, imapd, amavisd....
I then restarted those processes manually, and it went fine.
A few moments later i got the following messages on my ssh terminal:
kernel: Bad page state in process 'swapper'

The machine then completely locked, and did reboot (thanks to the watchdog).
This server is a HP DL380G5 with 12Gb memory, 8 SAS Disks, .... a quite
standard box.
The $HOME directories are stored on a drbd (version: 0.7.24
(api:79/proto:74)) partition (with an XFS filesystem).
The only 'non standard' thing I did use is a swap file instead of a swap
partition.
$ free             total       used       free     shared    buffers
 cached
Mem:      12471932    7420364    5051568          0       3984    6680868
-/+ buffers/cache:     735512   11736420
Swap:       393208          0     393208
$ grep swap /etc/fstab
/var/tmp/swapfile swap    swap    defaults    0   0
Might this be the (or one of the) cause of this problem ?

Thanks
