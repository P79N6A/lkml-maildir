Well, that's in theory. In practice I need several computers connected to a switch to share a single interface and look to the rest of LAN as a single node. All those computers must receive all packets desitned to that interface. Using non-multicast MAC confuses many switches.
Any suggestions? (Except not using a switch ;))
