Hi - your Red Hat installation will have used the Athlon-optimised
kernel by default, so it will not boot on a non-Athlon machine. You will
probably need to boot from a boot floppy, mount your filesystems, and
install a new i686-optimised kernel RPM. Or compile your own kernel on
another machine and get it in there.
I can't immediately give you the full details - look at Red Hat's
documentation or other help on the web....
Cheers
