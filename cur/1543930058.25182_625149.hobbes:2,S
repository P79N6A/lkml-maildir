And again, git handles both use cases, so what's your point?

It has been pointed out to you that it DOES.  Either that or nobody else 
understands your nebulous use of "transparency" so maybe you should 
define it like we've been asking you.  Furthermore, the comment you 
replied to said nothing about transparency, nor did your comment it was 
in reply to; rather it was pointing out the fact that your statement 
that the git can not perform version control on the client is patently 
false.

Perhaps you should.  We have been trying to get you to explain how you 
think git isn't "transparent" while at the same time pointing out how we 
think it is.  You have failed to demonstrate any evidence to back up 
your claims, all of which have been shown to be false.
