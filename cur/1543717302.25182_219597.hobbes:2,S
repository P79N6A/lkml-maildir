Yes, it's an issue with the initscripts (I'd say). I stumbled over this 
problem as well when upgrading e2fsprogs on a fairly old Slackware install. 
From the manpage of fsck:
The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following
       conditions:
            0    - No errors
            1    - File system errors corrected
            2    - System should be rebooted
[...]
The old Slackware init scripts (from 7.0 days I think) checked
 if [ $EXITCODE -gt 1 ] ; then
panic!
Newer fscks however also seem to return exit code 2 for "some errors 
corrected, please reboot". In Slack 9's initscripts this was changed to auto 
reboot in this case. I think this behaviour was changed in some version of 
fsck, but I'm note sure.
But admittedly I also got a slight heart attack when our server stopped 
booting with an error from fsck. ;)
