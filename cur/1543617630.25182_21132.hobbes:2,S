Hi!
I need to know (in a script shell for instance) if a running kernel
is compiled with/without module support. I don't have access to the
source tree when detecting (though I have it mounted sometime later).
Reading the source (fs/proc/proc_misc.c), I understand that the file
/proc/modules exists only when modules are supported by the running
kernel. Is that true? If so, can I assume that the following script
is correct?
-=-=-=-
#!/bin/bash
[ -e /proc/modules ] && echo Modules supported by running kernel. \
                     || echo Modules not supported by running kernel.
-=-=-=-
If not, how may I detect module support?
(Yes, I could build two kernels supporting modules vs not supporting
modules, but my machine is quite slow : 2h per compilation :-( ).
Thanks for any reply.
Regards,
Yann E. MORIN.
