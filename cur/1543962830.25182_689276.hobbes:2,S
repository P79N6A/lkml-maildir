That is because the md/dm don't set the plugged flag which I think they
should. So we fix that instead so that plugging works the same from the
block core or from a driver instead of adding work-arounds in the block
unplug handler. Adding a check for plugged in the plug handler is a
hack, I don't see how you can argue against that.
