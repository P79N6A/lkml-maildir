cool. It doesn't handle x={0,1} though.
Maybe we should have:
static inline unsigned long __attribute_const__ 
__roundup_pow_of_two(unsigned long x)
{
         return (1UL << fls(x - 1));
}
static inline unsigned long __attribute_const__ 
roundup_pow_of_two(unsigned long x)
{
         return (unlikely(x<2)?2:__roundup_pow_of_two(x));
}
