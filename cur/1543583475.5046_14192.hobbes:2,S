I'm using a PCMCIA SmartMedia adapter from Hagiwara here, it worked
out of the box with 2.2.19pre5 (the first kernel I tried, no particular
reason behind the version).   No patches, no libraries, no bull.
This laptop is a pile of crap and most PCMCIA related stuff tends to
break randomly  -  but this card has worked flawlessly all the time.
The trasfer-rate from a 32MByte flash card is roughly 800 KB/sec, it 
can't do DMA.
