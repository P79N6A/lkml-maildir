Note that with AMS we're better off -- it has two interrupts telling us
when something is wrong.
Hence, most of the discussion about loads of input values only applies
to hdaps, the actual head-park functionality can be implemented with AMS
without ever reading any sensor values.
Hence we also need much less complexity in userland -- once an interrupt
comes in we trigger the hd park...
