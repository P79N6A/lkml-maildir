My hardware guy says $0.02 for a jumper and $0.04 for a shunt =
$0.06.
$0.06 * 1.5e7 * 30 models per year = $27,000,000 per year
Let's say that it costs $100 to manufacture a hard drive, parts and
labour and design etc, but not including that extra jumper.
$100 * 1.5e7 * 30 models per year = $45,000,000,000 per year
The fact remains that it is an insignificant cost in the manufacture
of the hardware. Extremely insignificant. 0.06% by my estimates,
and I think I was conservative with the cost of manufacturing a
hard drive.
