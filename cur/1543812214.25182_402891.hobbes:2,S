You have advanced no reason for using flush_dcache_page() instead of
flush_kernel_dcache_page() except this:

It is my contention that flush_kernel_dcache_page() ejects the cache
lines that may be dirty in the kernel mapping and makes the underlying
memory coherent again.  This is the same net effect as a DMA transfer
(data in memory but not in kernel cache).

Could you actually address the argument instead of getting all huffy?
