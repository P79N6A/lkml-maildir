At least for x86 and I suspect some 1other architectures we don't
initially need a syscall at all for this. There is an instruction
RDPMC who can read a performance counter just fine. It is also much
faster and generally preferable for the case where a process measures
events about itself. In fact it is essential for one of the use cases
I would like to see perfmon used (replacement of RDTSC for cycle
counting) 
Later a syscall might be needed with event multiplexing, but that seems
more like a far away non essential feature.

I don't like read/write for this too much. I think it's better to
have individual syscalls.  After all that is CPU state and having
syscalls for that does seem reasonable.
