Because volatile is ill-defined? Or actually, *undefined* (well,
implementation-defined is as good as that)? It's *so* _vague_,
one doesn't _feel_ like using it at all!
We already have a complete API containing optimization barriers,
load/store/full memory barriers. With well-defined and
well-understood semantics. Just ... _why_ use volatile?

It will _always_ work. In fact you can't really say the same for
volatile. We already assume the compiler _actually_ took some
pains to stuff meaning into C's (lack of) definition of volatile and
implement it -- but in what sense, nobody knows (the C standard
doesn't, so what are we).

This is a legitimate criticism, I agree.
