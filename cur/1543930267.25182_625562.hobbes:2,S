Well, now some windows vanished, but no additional messages were 
produced by kernel. When somebody could tell what I exactly need to 
do... would be nice.
Or a hit, in what direction I should look. Because its really nasty to 
not being able to use a current kernel.
I already rebuild the whole system, as suggested by the gentoo-devs, 
without success.
I could also try to debug/strace/whatever the apps and wait for it to 
disappear.
Just talk to me, I am not able to do this on my own...
