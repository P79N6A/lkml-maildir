Yupp.  This makes me question again how the phys_addr_t thing is
supposed to work at all given struct resource uses unsigned long
for start and len, so the whole generic resource infrastructure
doesn't know about the higher bits...
Could someone point me a to a driver actually making use of the
extented ioremap address on ppc 44x?
