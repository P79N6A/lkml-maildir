Yes, I'll check -ac to see your changes. Although, I can't see what is
the impact of the unlimited number of the async pages on the aging, I
don't see a connection?!
In the mean time I tested the patch even more thoroughly under various
loads and I can't find any problem with it. Performance is same or
better a little bit, as you say. :)
My other patch (enlarging inactive dirty list) has a much bigger
impact on the aging process, but I also see only improvement with
it. I think that swap_out path should be tweaked a little bit (it is
too aggressive now), and then things will come up even better.
