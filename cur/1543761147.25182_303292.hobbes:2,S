Just as long as our labs "bathrooms" don't mysteriously get a
bazillion walls all over the place on kernel upgrade, we're ok.
I don't mind adding new options for advanced security, as long
as you don't change the defaults.  It's hard enough managing
a boatload of workstations under ideal conditions.  When the
default settings change every month it gets really annoying
really quickly. :-D.
