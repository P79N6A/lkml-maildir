Thanks...
Based on that, I tried the following patch, and it didn't change the
amount of space that is reserved on the stack.
  gcc version 4.0.3 20051201 (prerelease) (Debian 4.0.2-5)
Further, earlier version of gcc miscompile this construct.
They effectively treat that in-line structure as a 'static', and
seeing notify_change changes .ia_valid, the next time it is called
contents of the structure will be wrong.
