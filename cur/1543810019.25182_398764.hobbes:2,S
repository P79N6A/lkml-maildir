Quite possible. However, CaT is not a ub user normally, so we may never know.
Also, it leaves Martin's K7S5A. It seems that it may be easier to have the
old ZIP-100 locked to usb-storage with libusual. I am also concerned that
the old ZIP may require a manual spin-up, which ub does not do (my drive
spins up automatically).
