A kernel panic means that the kernel no longer knows what it's doing,
and therefore stops doing anything immediately. Hence it won't use the
filesystems and cannot log the panic to anything but the console. I
would think the best solution to your problem is to set up a serial
console to another machine, and log everything to disk on that
machine. See Documentation/serial-console.txt for how to set up a
serial console.
