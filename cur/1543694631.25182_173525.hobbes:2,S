Hi!
I tried those updates (over -test8, I downloaded .gz-version, and it
contained lots of files like include/asm/*, no problems patching,
through). Well, cursor problems only got worse.
VGA-softcursor problems are still there (backspace leaves ghost
cursors behind).
Cursor problems got *worse*. With vanilla, cursor got corrupted when
using gpm. Now it is *allways* corrupted :-(. I'm using vesafb.
