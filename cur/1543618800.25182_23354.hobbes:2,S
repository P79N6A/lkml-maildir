_Wonderful_ patch. I've been testing for the past hour or so on my
Yamaha CRW2200E (hooked up to hdc, ide1, on VIA vt82c686b (rev 40)), and
the cpu load has rarely peaked 7-9% with cdparanoia.
I have not had a chance to test with a SCSI reader yet because my local
patchset has some unresolved symbols in a scsi module, but I expect to
iron those out shortly.
Thanks again, Andrew.
