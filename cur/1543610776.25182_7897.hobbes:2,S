This is quite annoying to have non-pre kernels with simple bugs like 
recent loop device bug etc.
Maybe this can be prevented by adopting a rule that non-pre kernel is made
from last pre/ac/... which was good enough by changing version # _only_,
without even single buglet squashing?
This way we will not disappoint those people who download non-pres in hope
they are more stable.
Just my 2 cents.
