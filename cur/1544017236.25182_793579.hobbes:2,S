We are calculating timing register values, there will not be overflow
given that the delays are all under 1000nS and the clock rate will
never be greater than 10GHz.

It might not...

Multicore MIPS64 SOC.

Current, yes.  See above.

As with the others, I will try to improve it.

As with the case above, it works as only 64 bit kernel supported.

readw() does byte swapping, we don't want that, hence the __raw.

I will fix it.

I have to think about that one.
Thanks for looking at it,
