  Actually I've been trying this and I have not been able to create file
larger than 1GB on my computer without UDF corrupting slab or doing some
other nasty thing. OK, maybe if you created it in 1GB pieces it could
work but anyway the problem is that currently if you have UDF rw-mounted,
ordinary user could make UDF corrupt kernel memory... So consider this
limitation more as a hotfix to the security problem - real fix is to
rewrite UDF write path to not create extents larger than 1 GB but that
is quite some work and will definitely need more testing.

  See above.

  Yes, I plan to have a look into a proper fix of this problem (i.e. fix
UDF write path).
