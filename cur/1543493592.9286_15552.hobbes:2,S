  Recently I upgraded to kernel version 2.2.5 and my Optics Storage 8000
AT Cdrom Drive stop working.
  When I try to mount a cd this error message appear:
[root@cami: /root]# mount -t iso9660 /dev/optcd /cdrom/
ll_rw_block: device 11:00: only 1024-char blocks implemented (2048)
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=11:00, iso_blknum=16, block=16
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/optcd,
       or too many mounted file systems
( of course there is a valid disc inside )  
  I'm using a Debian 2.1 distribution whith the required updates from
unstable. I've checked the minimun requirements in Documentation/Changes
  The drive is in address 0x320, I exec:
[root@cami: /root]# dd if=/dev/optcd of=/dev/null
8352+0 registros leídos

  I must tell you that the same configuration works properly with a 2.0.xx
kernel.
  Any idea?
Thanks.
Cristian.
