Argh.
These magic numbers, where in terms of how hard to try, 0 is less than
1 is less than -1, but where the order -does- matter for parsing such
tests as "if ((can_try_harder >= 0)" and where one has to read the
entire code to guess that, continue to give me conniptions.
I thought Nick had an alternative proposal, involving just boolean
flags.  Why didn't you ever consider that?

Well - thanks for thinking of me ;).  Though, as I suggested in my
reply last time, including a pseudo patch, I thought that the existing
flags such as can_try_harder had enough information to determine when
to do the cpuset check, without yet another flag for that.  Having now
two magic 1's and 0's at the end of the calling argument lists is even
less readable.

I have no clue what patch you have in mind here.  Guess I'd have to see it.
