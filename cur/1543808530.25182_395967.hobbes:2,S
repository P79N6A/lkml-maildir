[I followed the instructions in
 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
 and
 Documentation/SubmittingPatches and corrected my patch submission.
 I hope it's ok this time. I copied the original text so you can
 use it for the changelog.]  
Hello dear developers,
I today booted the first time my embedded device using Linux 2.6.15.2,
which was booted by pxelinux, which then bootet itself from the nfsroot.
This went pretty fine, but when I was reading through
Documentation/nfsroot.txt I saw that there are some more modern versions
available of loading the kernel and passing parameters.
So I added them and the patch for that is attached to this mail.
Sincerly,
Nico
