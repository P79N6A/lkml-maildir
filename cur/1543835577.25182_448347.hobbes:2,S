Something's really broken with that version of udev then, because the
094 version I have running here works just fine with these symlinks.

Ah, ok, it sounds like it's not a bug in udev itself, but rather a bug
in the way your distro does it's initialization of udev, at boot.  I
suggest you file a bug with them, as they are known for doing this a bit
differently than any other distro (and different from how the udev
developers recommend), so they can fix it.  It's probably just a shell
script issue.
thanks,
