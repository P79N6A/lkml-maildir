On the target systems for the original SLOB design, we have less than
16MB of memory, so the linked list walking is pretty well bounded.

And again, the locking primarily exists for PREEMPT and small dual-core.
So I'm still a bit amused that you guys are using it for -RT.

I don't think this is correct, or else indicates a bug. We should only
scan the big block list when the freed block was page-aligned.

This I like a lot. I'd like to see a size/performance measurement of
this by itself. I suspect it's an unambiguous win in both categories.

Hmm. By every size, I assume you mean powers of two. Which negates
some of the fine-grained allocation savings that current SLOB provides.

Nice.
For what it's worth, I think we really ought to consider a generalized
allocator approach like Sun's VMEM, with various removable pieces.
Currently we've got something like this:
 get_free_pages     boot_mem         idr    resource_*   vmalloc ...
        |
      slab
        |
  per_cpu/node
        |
  kmem_cache_alloc
        |
     kmalloc
We could take it in a direction like this:
 generic range allocator          (completely agnostic)
          |
  optional size buckets           (reduced fragmentation, O(1))
          |    
    optional slab                 (cache-friendly, pre-initialized)
          |
 optional per cpu/node caches     (cache-hot and lockless)
          |
 kmalloc / kmem_cache_alloc / boot_mem / idr / resource_* / vmalloc / ...
(You read that right, the top level allocator can replace all the
different allocators that hand back integers or non-overlapping ranges.)
Each user of, say, kmem_create() could then pass in flags to specify
which caching layers ought to be bypassed. IDR, for example, would
probably disable all the layers and specify a first-fit policy.
And then depending on our global size and performance requirements, we
could globally disable some layers like SLAB, buckets, or per_cpu
caches. With all the optional layers disabled, we'd end up with
something much like SLOB (but underneath get_free_page!).
