Same kernel here, but on an older system (MDV2007.1). I tested with a 
path_id from a recent udev as well, though, but the problem was there as 
well.

I don't have anything under /dev/input/by-path as the lookup in path_id 
fails.

Probably.

What does this print as devpath for you:
$ udevinfo -q all --name=input/event0
For me on 2.6.23rc5 it prints:
P: /class/input/event0
and on 2.6.22:
P: /class/input/input0/event0
Both are detected as "old sysfs layout" by path_id, but only on 2.6.22 
is there a /device symlink pointing to the expected location.
I suspect it prints something like /devices/xyz for you, right?
That seems to be detected as "new sysfs layout" by path_id and handled 
differently.

Indeed, at least regarding input subsystem, for which there was a recent 
switchover [1] from class_device.
