But you can easily fall into one, e.g. by mounting a SMB share to ~/mnt,
working until after the windows box breaks down and trying to save the
work of the last hour (which involves enumerating and stat()ing all
entries in ~).

Maybe the device/mountpoint causing the processes to hang can be declared
dead (This is the more important part to me) and/or the syscall can be
forced to fail. If it involves wasting some MB of RAM for copying all
possibly affected memory in order to avoid corrupting used RAM, that
will be the price to pay for not losing your data.
How to clean up the stuck processes: (This requires a MMU)
Add an error path to each syscall (or create some generic error paths) and
keep the original stack frame. On errors, you can "longjump" (not exactly,
but similar) to the error path after copying the memory. The semaphore will
not be taken, and the code depending on the semaphore will not be executed.
