Right.  I have also pointed out to Jeff already that the test is done
wrong... it's pretty clear from the code that VIA has set up a feature
flag space of their own like Intel, AMD and Transmeta already have
(which is a good thing), so we should add that as an additional word
in the feature test vector instead of special-casing such a bit.
In fact, we need to add two words since Intel ran out of theirs and
started using additional flags in %ecx just recently.
