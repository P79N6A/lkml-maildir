Exactly.  In Fedora we've just added a fw-sbp2 case to mkinitrd, it's only a 
couple of lines of extra shell code:
     elif [ "$modName" = "fw-sbp2" ]; then
         findmodule fw-core
         findmodule fw-ohci
         modName="fw-sbp2"
and that's the extent of the changes.  The sbp2 case for the old drivers is 
still in there and in the end mkinitrd works with either stack.
