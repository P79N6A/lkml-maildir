I thought about that, but am not sure that it makes sense as there is
much less metadata in a raid array than there is in a filesystem.
I think I am happier to have initial code require feature_map == 0 or
it doesn't get loaded, and if it becomes an issue, get user-space to
clear any 'compatible' flags before passing the device to an 'old'
kernel.

As there is no current code, or serious project that I know of, to add
journalling to md (I have thought about it, but it isn't a priority) I
wouldn't like to pre-empt it at all by defining fields now.  I would
rather that presense-of-a-journal be indicated by a bit in the feature map,
and that would imply uuid was stored in one of the current 'pad'
fields.  I think there is plenty of space.
Thanks,
