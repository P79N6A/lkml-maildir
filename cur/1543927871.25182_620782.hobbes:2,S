Based on a quick look at sata_mv it appears it sets a 64-bit DMA mask 
unconditionally, but for non-ATA_PROT_DMA commands (which includes all 
ATAPI), it just falls back to ata_qc_issue_prot which issues via the 
legacy SFF interface and can only handle 32-bit addressing. So yes, it 
appears to have a similar bug as sata_nv had.
Likely it needs a similar slave_config trick to change bounce limit 
depending on the connected device, unless there is really a way to issue 
ATAPI commands with this EDMA interface, as the TODO list in sata_mv.c 
suggests may be possible..
