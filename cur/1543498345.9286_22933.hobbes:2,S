Ok. Fair enough. :)
Now I'm really stepping into dark and murky waters (for me :). How would
hot swappable/removable devices (zip/jaz/120mb disks, removable HDs) get
handled in this scheme.
For example: Zip disks.
Amiga zip disks are hd?1 (on an ide interface) while msdos ones are hd?4.
I might also wish to create a zip disk with 2 partitions (for whatever 
reason).
How would this be handled?
I suppose a question in hiding here is how partitions on HDs are handled. Is
the mapping something like:
/dev/hda1 -> /dev/ide/hd/a1
or somesuch?
