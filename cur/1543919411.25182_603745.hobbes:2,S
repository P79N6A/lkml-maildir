Hi Roland.
I have been through a number of arch linker scripts lately
introducing a consistent style.
I decided upon a style matching what we have for c today:
indent with one tab, nothing after starting {,
indendt after starting { etc.
Would you mind introducing same style for the vdso linker script?
I could do it just fine but I'm afraid to clash with your work.
None of my clean-up patches has hit -linus yet but I
assume most will do so during the merge window. All arch maintainers
has accepted the cleanup patches.
Latest in the series was parisc - patch is here:
