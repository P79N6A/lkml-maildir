Actually, I'm running an FTP server on the testbed machine and pushing the
data from a client on another (much faster) machine. I straced the server
(redhat wu-ftpd2.6.1-20) and it looks like 8 KB reads/writes.
After the transfer gets going...
1329  read(8, "v&X\205:\327.+\310/a\335\24Sa\361c\243\r\244\260~\264z"..., 8192) = 8192
1329  write(7, "v&X\205:\327.+\310/a\335\24Sa\361c\243\r\244\260~\264z"..., 8192) = 8192
1329  rt_sigaction(SIGALRM, {0x804b030, [ALRM], SA_RESTART|0x4000000}, {0x804b030, [ALRM], SA_RESTART|0x4000000}, 8) = 0
1329  alarm(1200)                       = 1200
1329  read(8, "\335\235\335\35}\335]\375\17\373|\324VS[\r\266Af\333\246"..., 8192) = 8192

...etc.
Following your method and wget'ting from a remote server seems to do 
a bit better (just watching vmstat since I can't compare timings against
my original method). wget seems to read 8K and write it in two 4K writes.
Don't know if this has anything to do with things... Pauses are still
there and the disc activity light still goes out several times per minute
coincident with the pauses.
