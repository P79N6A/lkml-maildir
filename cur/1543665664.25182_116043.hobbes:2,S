	Oops.  You're right it is possible to deactivate
CONFIG_NUMA in this kernel under X86_PC, and that avoids
the problem.  I guess there still is the minor issue that
either CONFIG_NUMA should work with X86_PC + HIGHMEM (even
on machines without high memory) or else CONFIG_NUMA
should not be selectable in this case, but that's obviously
a bug of much less importance.
	Sorry for my misunderstanding of the CONFIG_NUMA configution
options.
