Hi,
I wrote about ide problems with 2.4.19-pre8 a few days ago (it just trashed
filesystem in a couple hours) & I was told to try 2.4.19-pre8-ac5 it was a
little bit better though every 5-8 hours I've got ide errors in log (at
least it didn't crash my reiserfs volumes yet):

But now I've got even more bugs in log like:

>-----------------------------
I don't even think about trying 2.4.19-pre9 since it doesn't has any ide
related issues in its changelist.
The question is -- What I have to try to get WORKING ide driver under
"STABLE" kernel?
