Some systems do, if I'm understanding you properly. Summit based boxes
have an on-chipset performance counter that runs at 100Mhz. My
cyclone-timer patch uses this as a gettimeofday/__delay time source in
the 2.4 kernel. Additionally George Anzinger has patches that allow the
ACPI PM timer to be used as well. Intel's HPET should also provide
another time source.

True, but hopefully my timer-changes patch will allow for better
abstraction around these varied time sources, so one won't really need
to know how all of these different sources work.
