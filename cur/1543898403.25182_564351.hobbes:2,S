Davide's patch adds a owner_uid field to mm_struct.  Assuming that turns
into a "mm security equivalence class identifier", the LSM can simply
update it when a label-change-event occurs.  No need to call out to
(potentially heavyweight!) LSM code in page allocation critical paths.
I'm a bit concerned that tracking the equivalence classes will get
expensive.  I think you can end up with quadratic explosion in the worst
case (every user using every permutation of LSM bits).
