yes. and this patch will flag cases that don't (yet) work well

it won't break error paths, it will at most put a warning in the log.
It doesn't kill or otherwise damage the system or process.

That's a pretty bold statement; assuming that the TASK_KILLABLE patch
is in, I don't see the problem.
And even if a distro doesn't turn it on, I still don't see a problem;
it's a diagnostics patch that people can turn on (even at runtime) if
they see problems.

I'll just have to disagree with you then; but both of us are making
wild guesses. Only one way to get the real false positive percentage.

1) with TASK_KILLABLE that shouldn't happen
2) how does "throwing a backtrace" "break" things?
