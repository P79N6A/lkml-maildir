Real quickly, CIPSO doesn't try to. CIPSO attaches attribute information
to the packet, and that's it. Smack uses CIPSO because it's available
and sufficient to get the required information about packets from one
task to another inside the box. It does the job going off box, too.
The authentication issues are very real, but a separate issue.

That would break sockets. I really doubt that you're suggesting that
cryptographic authentication is required on the loopback interface.
