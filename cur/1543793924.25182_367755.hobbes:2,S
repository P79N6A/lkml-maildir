Subject: [PATCH 3/3] sparse provide pfn_to_nid
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

sparsemem: provide pfn_to_nid
Before SPARSEMEM is initialised we cannot provide an efficient
pfn_to_nid() implmentation; before initialisation is complete we use
early_pfn_to_nid() to provide location information.  Until recently
there was no non-init user of this functionality.  Provide a post
init pfn_to_nid() implementation.
Note that this implmentation assumes that the pfn passed has
been validated with pfn_valid().  The current single user of this
function already has this check.
