Well, given that your e2fsck transcript started with this:
> /dev/hda3 has been mounted 38 times without being checked, check forced
#1, This is why periodic checks are a good thing; it catches problems
that could stay hidden and result in data loss sooner rather later.
#2, It seems unlikely tha tthe problem is tied to 2.6.21-rc1.  The
filesystme corruption could have happened at any time in the last 38
mounts.  It could be caused by hardware problems, or software
problems; there really is no telling.
#3, With respect to your use of gentoo's unstable e2fsprogs, it seems
unlikely that the corruptions were caused by gentoo's e2fsprogs.  The
being said, Gentoo includes a number of development patches that I
wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable putting into production, and
indeed haven't been checked into SCM yet.  So it makes me nervous, but
I doubt it's related to your specific problem.
