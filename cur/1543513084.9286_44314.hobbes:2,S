I'm running the tcpdump on another machine that is on the hub that the server
is on.  That hub gets all the traffic that the server gets.  I figure this is
the only way to see what is actually happening between client and server.
Should I run a tcpdump on both the client segment and the server segment, and
send the results here?  This is completely reproducible.
