It is not possible, and in this case, it really shouldn't make much
difference to you either as the readahead code is adaptive: it should
automatically detect that you are doing short reads.
If you want to check that it is working, I suggest using tcpdump to
monitor the NFS traffic to that file, then comparing with a "strace"
dump.
