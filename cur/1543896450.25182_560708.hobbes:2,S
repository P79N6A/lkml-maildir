Yes, that would be more complex than we need.  You're right.
The only problem comes with kernel tasks that are pinned to less than
the entire system, and that are in the top cpuset.
They should remain in the top cpuset.  Since the top cpuset is never
allowed to have less than all the cpus in the system, such kernel
threads can then be assured of being allowed to use the cpus they need
to use.
Could you try coding something like the following in kernel/cpuset.c,
Srivatsa?
/* Call with task_lock held on tsk */
is_pinned_kernel_thread(tsk)
{
	/* "pinned" means constrained to a strict subset of online cpus */
	int is_pinned = !cpus_subset(cpus_online_map, tsk->cpus_allowed);
	int is_kthread = !tsk->mm || (tsk->flags & PF_BORROWED_MM);
	return is_pinned && is_kthread;
}
Then call it from kernel/cpuset.c:attach_task() with:
	/* Don't moved pinned kernel threads out of top cpuset */
	if (is_pinned_kernel_thread(tsk) && oldcs == &top_cpuset && cs != oldcs) {
                task_unlock(tsk);
                mutex_unlock(&callback_mutex);
                put_task_struct(tsk);
		return -EINVAL;
	}
