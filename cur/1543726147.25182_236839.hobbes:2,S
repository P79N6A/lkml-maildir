    But this must be enabled in the application, am I wrong? using
SO_KEEPALIVE. Can it be enabled using sysctl or the like.
    Thanks for the information. When I saw the transitions, I thought
that the server got the FIN after the client died, but obviously it
can get it when the client doesn a half-close, and I didn't think of
it. Thanks, Markus :)
    Now, is there any sysctl that enables a keepalive for this kind
of connections (dead remote end, local in CLOSE_WAIT) for all
connections?
