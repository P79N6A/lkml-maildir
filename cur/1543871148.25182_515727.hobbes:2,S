Hi Marco,
I just tested your driver you have posted to the linux-dvb mailing list.
I have problem load firmware into device:
usb 5-3: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4
usb 5-3: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
dvb-usb: found a 'Opera1 DVB-S USB2.0' in cold state, will try to load a 
firmware
dvb-usb: downloading firmware from file 'opera1.fw'
dvb-usb: firmware download failed at 9418 with -22
opera1: probe of 5-3:1.0 failed with error -22
usbcore: registered new interface driver opera1
My firmware files are:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  8300 2006-04-05 21:23 opera1-2.fw
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 55894 2006-04-05 21:23 opera1-fpga.fw
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  9432 2006-04-05 21:22 opera1.fw

I have created wish in kernel's bugzilla before, so we can track it there:

Thanks for help.
Michal
