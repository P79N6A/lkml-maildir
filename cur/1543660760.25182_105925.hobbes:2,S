Well, okay, there's two ways you can build a single module in a directory 
in 2.4, one is to have
	O_TARGET := module.o
	obj-m    := $(O_TARGET)
	obj-y    := part1.o part2.o
The other is
	O_TARGET := something.o
	obj-m    := module.o
	module-objs := part1.o part2.o
(plus a link rule for module.o)
In 2.5, only the second way is legal, so if you're aiming for a compatible 
Makefile, you'd use that one, and then O_TARGET shouldn't matter for 
"make modules".
