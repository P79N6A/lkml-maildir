Hmm, I think we're mixing two different threads here.
	1. How to map irq affinity handling onto cpusets.
	2. Whether and how to create in kernel 'boot' cgroup/cpuset.
They are somewhat orthogonal imho. In a sense that no mater how we decide to 
handle irqs (even if we do not do them under cpusets at all) we may still want 
'boot' group. As I mentioned at the beginning of this thread 'boot group/set 
is basically just a convenience feature. The only difference between root/top 
  group is that 'boot' group can be dynamically resized and moved.
Ok. So the rest of the email is mostly about irqs. It'd be nice if it was in 
the other thread (cpuset: irq affinity support) but I'm ok with replying here.

I'm not sure #2 is a concern. With the latest couset irq handling patches 
conflict resolution is very simple. "irq can belong to a single cpuset at a time".

I do not think we need overlapping irq directives.

I'm not sure what breakage you're talking about. But lets talk examples I 
guess. See below.

How is that any different from tasks ? Exact same example right back at you.
Suppose I have a task that needs to run in A and B but not C. In fact if you 
look at the example that I provided in the other thread I already have such an 
app. In my current apps different threads have to run in different cpusets.
And yes I think the way to solve that is to use more complex cpuset hierarchy 
like the one you used above. I would not necessarily mix in the 'boot' set 
here. I mean if people want to subdivide it that's fine but they do not have 
to. I mean people can just nuke the 'boot' group/set and create something else.

It does not force any changes. irqs handled just like tasks and if people have 
complex partitioning requirements they may have to use more complicated 
hierarchies.

That (ie additional sets of irqs) seems like an major overkill to me.
Probably because I do not think that there are any conflicts to resolve in the 
first place. As I explained above if we treat irqs just like tasks (from 
cpuset perspective) then same exact rules and limitations apply. Irq can be 
assigned to a single cpuset at a time. Complex requirements can be solved 
either by deeper cgroup/cpuset hierarchies or worst case if there is something 
  totally wacky constraint people always have an option of assigning irq to 
the top cpuset and using /proc/irq/N/smp_affinity interface to select which 
cpus it can run on.

Hold on. How does this help if at the end of the day 'cpus' are still shared 
between the irq and task groups ? We'd still have exact same constrains.
btw I'm starting to gravitate back towards my original solution (ie cpu_map 
that tells which cpus can be used by kernel and irqs). If you remember I was 
totally against using cpusets/cgroup exactly because they are designed to 
handle tasks. You guys convinced me that we can extend them and that it's a 
better way to go about. Yet after weeks of discussion we seem to be taking 
about adding more and more stuff.
Anyway, I think treating irqs as tasks and enforcing the same rules and 
constraints should handle most scenarios even complex ones at the expense of 
deeper cpuset hierarchies. Adding new 'cgroups' or 'sets' just for irqs seems 
overkill.
