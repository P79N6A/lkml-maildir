Hi Linus,
Agreed!  In my alternative version of the Posix timers patch, I avoid
calling do_signal() from clock_nanosleep by using a variant of the 
existing ERESTARTNOHAND mechanism.  The problem I ran into was that I
could not tell on entry to clock_nanosleep if it was a new call or
an old one being restarted.  I solved this by adding a new 
ERESTARTNANOSLP error code and making a small change in do_signal().
The handling of ERESTARTNANOSLP is the same as ERESTARTNOHAND but also
sets a new flag in the task_struct before restarting the system call.
This is still an architecture-specific change but atleast it is simple.
