Not necessarily: consider the SCSI WWN, which is supported by most modern SCSI 
devices.  The driver never probes for or asks for this.  Nowhere in the 
current SCSI code do we ask for this.  However user level commands (like 
sg_inq) can formulate the 0x83 page inquiry to get this and return the output. 
 This works today with the current driver.

but the complexity is in the "common method to determine device type and 
several methods of passing guid".  Even for a simple SCSI disk, there's no one 
universal way of getting a unique id (let alone when we add the usb devices 
masquerading as scsi disks into the mix).  That will lead us to scanning a 
list of inquiry strings to see what the disk is and determine what globally 
unique ID it supports.  Since we have to implement a lookup table just to 
determine how to get the unqiue id, it's far better off being done outside the 
kernel.
