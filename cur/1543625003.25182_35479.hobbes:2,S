There is a posix_fadvise() syscall in the POSIX Advanced Realtime
specification
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/posix_fadvise.html
I don't know if this has been mentioned on linux-kernel before, but in
January, the Open Group, in cooperation with IEEE, added the POSIX
functionality to their specification and made it available online for free.
It's at
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/toc.htm
There are some useful tables at
http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/online.html
 and they ask that you
register there so that they know how many people are using the
specification.
They don't have a downloadable version of this specification, but they do
for the previous versions:
