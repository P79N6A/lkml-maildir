Well, since there are commands that work on this (push and log at
least), I believe that some operations could succeed. I *know* that
remote cloning was impossible, and it *looked* like pulling too was
during my attempts to fix the problem before understanding its root
cause. It is possible that I cumulated problems though, if at least
two people could pull from it.
Cheers,
