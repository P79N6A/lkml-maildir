Cool, are you using an ide drive as the source of the iso?
Thanks for the raport. I'd also like raports such as this one (which I
really do appreciate) to contain an oppinion of how well cd recording
works on your system now as compared to before. Anything from "didn't
notice any difference" to "it's much faster, I noticed that because" and
"bah it sucks right now, ..." would be fine :)

IDE, indeed :-)
deadline scheduler works really well with ide drives, SCSI tends to
still _suck_.
