It seemed to be doing the right thing here on an X31 (had to give it
back to its owner; will retrieve and test again tomorrow to make sure
everything is matching up).

I don't know that having another mixer is really the right answer.  You
want to have the buttons/hardware volume matching (and showing)
on-screen changes to the system volume.  Otherwise, things are just
confusing to a user.

Brightness events are being reported as is with the X60t I've got...

Having the volume keys reported makes it so that we get the on-screen
display of the volume changing and /proc/acpi/ibm/volume matches what
the displayed volume shows.
As far as other Lenovos, if you want it tested out on more of them,
that's easy enough to do as they're very common in the office here.  But
the couple of people that I've given the patched module to haven't had
problems (various T60s)
