There are two options that are required and it might be that one of them
is missing:
1. "Code maturity level options" -> "Prompt for development and/or
                                     incomplete code/drivers"
2. "General setup" -> "Power Management support"
Most likely the first one is the missing option (don't expect that the
average user has activated CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL).
