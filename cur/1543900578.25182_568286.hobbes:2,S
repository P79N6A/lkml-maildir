Maybe my usage of terminology has some problem. But, the "device
hibernate" here means put device into quiescent state and save the
device state, but do not put device into low power state.

There is no need for two kernel. Most drivers and optional features are
compiled as modules, as that of most desktop distributions. So just
"insmod" needed modules only in hibernate kernel is sufficient.
