The "must have" feature of 2.4 was iptables. You simply can't do as good
a firwall or network device without stateful sockets. Other than device
drivers the kicker of 2.6 is crypto. If you need the features you really
will go.
Latency in 2.4 seems better, at least for some of the stuff I use, and I
see the new scheduler and NPTL are in the latest Redhat 2.4, so those
are not compelling for most people.
I would still like to see all the responsiveness features, VM, low
latency, preempt current. The O(1) scheduler is still getting better
daily in 2.6, about 2.4.25 that should be ready. Then when what we have
is working as well as it can, we can add features.
