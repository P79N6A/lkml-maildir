Amateur Radio Support contains options to do with things like ham
radio modem support.
Radio Adaptors contains options to do with radio tuner cards.
Radio adaptors was originally put together with Video for Linux,
because when there were only a few radio adaptors supported, it seemed
logical to group them with video capture cards, which often have
television tuners on them.
Most of the illogical grouping of configuration options has come about
because of the way the kernel has evolved.
For example, before IDE and SCSI CD-ROM drives because popular, CD-ROM
drives were a completely separate configuration category.  Now that
IDE and SCSI CD-ROM drives are much more popular than proprietary
interface CD-ROM drives, the configuration options for them are
grouped with the IDE and SCSI options.
