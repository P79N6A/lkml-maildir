Right. That was the original problem that Keith was running into, that I
tried to fix without fully understanding how the asm constraints worked.

'Twas meant as more of a mental exercise for myself than a needed feature.
I'll agree that it's not something needed in the kernel proper. Though
maybe there should be a comment or something in unistd.h to the effect of
"we use %ebx in syscalls -- if you're using -fpic, get ready for writing
your own syscall entry macros"...
Thanks all.
