"That efforts to fix swsusp only started recently" part is
untrue. Driver work was pretty much done from the time swsusp was
merged, and is ongoing.

You should be able to ^c resume script, too. (But that's going to
cause problems anyway, no?)

No, he did not. Driver fixes should be sent to relevant maintainers,
not as a part of "suspend2 -- merge this"...

You read again. As drivers are common in swsusp and uswsusp
cases... of course we are working on fixing that.

I seen Nigel's recent patch. Yes, it is easier to just start
over. (8000 unneccessary lines... that's 3 times size of swsusp with
uswsusp included!)

It works today, try it.

I'm not interested in "easiest way to fast hibernation". I'm
interested in "right way to fast hibernation".
