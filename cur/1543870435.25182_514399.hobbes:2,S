I don't think that my patches have been merged by Linus yet (sent by
Andrew, but there must be some delay there :) .
To see if anything has already been patched, it often takes reviewing
both Linus's tree and Andrew's -mm patches.  Hopefully we don't also
need to review all gits of all maintainers, since Andrew tries to
merge all of those into the -mm patchset.

gmail works if you use the SMTP interface to it (or probably with
attachments, but they aren't good for reviews/reviewers).
Yes, mutt works.
