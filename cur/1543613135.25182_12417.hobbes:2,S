How would it lock up? Could you describe the symptoms in more detail so that
I can compare?

Oh, how did you do that? We tried to put 2Gb on one board but it wouldn't
recognize more than 1 Gb. I'm fairly sure we flashed the bios with the
latest firmware. Which board is it you have, Epox BXB-S or Epox KP6-BS?

Yes, I noticed that too. Unfortunately, I've tested with both 1G and 4G
support when configuring the kernel, and the i/o lockups still happen.
