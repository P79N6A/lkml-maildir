Oops about the space. And it's to make the format string a constant
literal. If it isn't, you are going to run into trouble with options
to remove printks at compile-time based on log-level token. I realize
it's not really an issue at this point in time, but I assume that it
will eventually make its way into the kernel in some way or another.
