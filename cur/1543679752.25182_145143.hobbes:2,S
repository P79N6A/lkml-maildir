Subject: scsi mode sense broken again

For me 2.5.72 works, 2.5.74 does not - no working ZIP drive.
The cause is the recent fiddling of use_10 / do_mode_sense.
If this is known and has a patch on the way all is well.
Otherwise I can send a patch.

(It feels as if I have to repair this area every other month.)
