They probably recognise that crackers are more likely to use Linux than 
Windows as the platform of choice. From their point of view, an incoming 
connection from a Windows client is less of a risk. At least, that's the 
best spin I can put on it. It would be interesting to see if they are using 
NT and IIS for their web servers, since they are so secure... <g>
