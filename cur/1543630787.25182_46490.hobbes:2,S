OTOH, those of us who are not looking forward to kbuild 2.5 are grateful for any
delays we can get.

This is getting ridiculous all right.
Linus, what makes you ignore Keith's work?
Would you tend to think he's worked on kbuild25 this long
to end up having to send a linus-dammit-would-you-have-
-a-look-at-last-i'm-not-going-to-keep-asking-forever msg?
Sorry for a slightly offensive post; I can't stand to
see such impoliteness.
