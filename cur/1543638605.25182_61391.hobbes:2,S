Sounds to me like something changed in debian.  'unstable' is like
that.
It would appear that you aren't using autodetect partitions, so you
need to have either 'raidstart -a' or 'mdadm -As' run at boot time,
with appropriate config files: /etc/raidtab or /etc/mdadm.conf.
Check your rc scripts and config files, decide which one you want to
use, and make sure the right script is enabled and the right
configfile has appropriate information.
