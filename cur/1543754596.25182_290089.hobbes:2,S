Subject: don't let mmap allocate down to zero

With some programs the 2.6 kernel can end up allocating memory
at address zero, for a non-MAP_FIXED mmap call!  This causes
problems with some programs and is generally rude to do. This
simple patch fixes the problem in my tests.
Make sure that we don't allocate memory all the way down to zero,
so the NULL pointer never gets covered up with anonymous memory
and we don't end up violating the C standard.
