OK, that makes it easier to track down -- thanks. Unfortunately my
scratch i386 box in the office hasn't rebooted onto my test kernel so
it'll have to wait until (a sensible hour in) the morning.
I suspect it might be the sigset size. We have a whole bunch of 
	/* XXX: Don't preclude handling different sized sigset_t's.  */
	if (sigsetsize != sizeof(sigset_t))
		return -EINVAL;
