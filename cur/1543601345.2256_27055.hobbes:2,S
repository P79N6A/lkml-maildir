Ok, that's a bug.
You must not call copy_to_user with the mmap semaphore acquired - linux
semaphores are not recursive.

Yes, and preferable switch to multiline copies - a full page temporary
buffer is allocated, transfering data on a line-by-line base is way too
much overhead (and the current volatile_task is an ugly hack).
