Ahh. At least _most_ builds seem ok. I only looked at the first failing 
one, and it _seems_ to be due to "drivers/usb/gadget/pxa2xx_udc.c" which 
still includes <asm/irq.h> rather than <linux/irq.h>.
Maybe. I could do the trivial fix myself, but there have been people who 
have ARM build environments, so maybe somebody who can actually verify 
whether that one-liner fixes things (or whether there is something else 
hiding) can do that and send me the patch.
[ Although I've gotten so much email lately that maybe I already missed 
  that patch. Ahh, the joys of SCM discussions ;) ]
