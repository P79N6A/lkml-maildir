The Coverity checker spotted the following use-after-free
in net/9p/mux.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
struct p9_conn *p9_conn_create(struct p9_transport *trans, int msize,
                                    unsigned char *extended)
{
...
        if (!m->tagpool) {
                kfree(m);
                return ERR_PTR(PTR_ERR(m->tagpool));
        }
...
<--  snip  -->

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
