I realised today that this happens every time X starts up for
the first time.   I did some experiments, and found that with 2.6.12rc1
it's gone. Either it got fixed accidentally, or its hidden now
by one of the many changes in 4-level patches.
I'll try and narrow this down a little more tomorrow, to see if I
can pinpoint the exact -bk snapshot (may be tricky given they were
broken for a while), as it'd be good to get this fixed in 2.6.11.x
if .12 isn't going to show up any time soon.
