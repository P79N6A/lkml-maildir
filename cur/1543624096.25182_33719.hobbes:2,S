   So what is currently the best combination of gige card/driver/cost?
   What do you recommend to the budget-conscious?
I can only tell you what I know performance wise about cards,
and currently it looks like:
1) Intel E1000
2) Tigon2, aka. Acenic
3) SysKonnect sk98, but has broken TX checksums.  If it had
   working TX checksums it would be in 2nd place instead of Acenic.
   This hw bug is essentially why Acenics were used for all the
   TUX benchmarks runs instead of SysKonnect cards.
4) Tigon3, aka. bcm57xx
This may surprise some people, but frankly I think the Tigon3's PCI
dma engine is junk based upon my current knowledge of the card.  It is
always possible I may find out something new which kills this
perception I have of the card, but we'll see...
All the cards listed above have good GPL'd drivers available.
