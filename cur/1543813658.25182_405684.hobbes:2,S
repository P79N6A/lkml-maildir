I think supporting multiple IDs per node is a reasonable expectation to
have from udev (even for subsystems beyond PnP).  Kay, would this be
difficult to add?
However, I'm a little confused as to why we're exporting these "modalias"
strings from a kernel interface in the first place.  Wouldn't it be better
from an abstraction barrier standpoint to have userspace generate such
strings from information it gathered through bus-specific interfaces? As
can be seen from this example, when the modalias (or essentially a device
identification key) is imposed at the kernel level driver model interface,
one has to make policy decisions (e.g. what legacy features such as isapnp
are we going to only psuedo-support).
Thanks,
Adam
