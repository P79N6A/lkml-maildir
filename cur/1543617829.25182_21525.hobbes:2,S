Can you check if your 2.4.5/8 driver actually does 100bt-FD autonegotiation
correctly?  I believe it was broken during that time, and fixed in 2.4.9.
It's possible that that may have something to do with the problem, but
it's a stretch...
It might also be interesting to see if the working driver still works
if you forward port it into 2.4.17....
