NACK.  While a readers can sleep rcu version definitly has it's
we should make it all or nothing.  Either we always gurantee that
a rcu reader can sleep or never without external patches.  Having
this a config option is the ultimate defeat for any kind of bug
reproducabilility.
Please make the patch undconditional and see if it doesn't cause
any significant slowdowns in production-like scenaries and then
we can switch over to the readers can sleep variant unconditionally
at some point.
