Yes. Please, look through archives - this horse was beaten to death back
in January. In short: empty files have no clusters; no, we can't allocate
a hidden cluster when we create a file since we may get a filesystem from
DOS and DOS doesn't do that; no, allocation upon open/stat/etc. is not
going to fly since -ENOSPC from stat() will confuse the heck of everything;
yes, all schemes along the lines "let's do something for Linux-only
setups" are braindead since there is no reasons to use FAT in such setups;
yes, FAT is in sore need of pointed stick, mallet and garlic; no, even its
authors can't kill the bloody thing and they would *like* to do that.
