I guessed that as well. It isn't good enough. Consider a guest with a
large (virtual) memory size and a host with a small physical memory
size. The guest will never put any page on the inactive_clean list
because it does not have memory pressure. vmscan will never run. The
host wants to reclaim memory of the guest, but since the
inactive_clean list is empty it will find only stable pages.
