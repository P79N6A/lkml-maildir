Marcello,
That might have been Alex Williamson...but the reasons for 64K pages
is to reduce TLB thrashing, not faster IO.
On HP ZX1 boxes, SG performance is slightly better (max +5%) when going
through the IOMMU than when bypassing it. The IOMMU can perfectly
coalesce DMA pages but has a small CPU and DMA cost to do so as well.
Otherwise, I totally agree with James. IO devices do scatter-gather
pretty well and IO subsystems are tuned for page-size chunk or
smaller anyway.

Big pages are good for CPU TLB and that's where most of the
research has been done. I think IO devices have learned to cope
with the fact the alot less has been (or can be for many
workloads) done to coalesce IO pages.
