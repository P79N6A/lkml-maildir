Perhaps the right use of DMA_BIRECTIONAL needs to be
defined.
Could it be used with a XDWRITE(10) SCSI command
defined in sbc3r07.pdf at 
http://www.t10.org
 ? I suspect
using two scatter gather lists would be a better approach.

Then it is not sufficient for modern SCSI transports in which
certain bidirectional commands (probably most) have a well
defined order.
So DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL looks PCI specific and it may have
been a mistake to replace other subsystem's direction flags
with it. RDMA might be an interesting case.
