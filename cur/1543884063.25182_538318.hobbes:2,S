Hmm. Wouldn't it be nicer to make "kmap_atomic()" be an inline function 
instead? That way, if you pass it a "void *", it still just works, and you 
get a much nicer/more readable error message too when the types actually 
don't match?
Of course, there may be some reason why <linux/highmem.h> does those with 
#define's rather than inline functions. Maybe "page_address()" or 
"pagefault_disabled()" is not declared at that point, and asking it to be 
declared might cause header file inclusion recursion?
