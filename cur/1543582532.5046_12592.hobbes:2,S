my major gripe right now is that we still have bug reports that say that
systems hang when using nmi_watchdog=1 and work if nmi_watchdog=0.
Changing the NMI watchdog to be 1 Hz will make these bugreports "Linux
hangs once a week" instead of a "Linux hangs after 1-2 hours", which is
clearly hiding things and making debugging harder.
(and driving kernel-profiling from the NMI interrupt is a short-term
patch, so there is just no point in going to 1 Hz right now just to go
back to 100 Hz a few days later.)
the rest of the changes are excellent - it's only the 100 Hz NMI issue i
have a problem with.
