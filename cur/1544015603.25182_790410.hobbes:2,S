Thanks Ted and Greg.
Ted, when you said this, do you mean the page "all_whole.html"?
If so, my explanation is that this page lists all the people who
ever worked for TLF since 2.6.13 age.
Is there any mistake?
If you mean the page "2_6_29_whole.html".
Here are only four people be listed:
Stephen Hemminger <shemminger@vyatta.com> \\working for vyatta now?
Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>
Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Chris Wright <chrisw@osdl.org> \\redhat engineer
I will fix that.

Greg, I've used your gitdm-config-2.6. And don't see any update, where should
I find your latest work?
