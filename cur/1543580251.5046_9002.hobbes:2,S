Heh. I am. Read-only XIP is going to be doable, but writable XIP means that
any time you start to write to the flash chip, you have to find all the
mappings of every page from that chip and mark them absent, then deal 
properly with faults on them; making processes sleep till the chip is in a 
readable state again. It's going to suck. Lots.
I'm not going to emulate our beloved leader and declare that it's never
going to be supported - I have no particular problem with someone doing
this, as long as I don't have to get too involved and it doesn't end up in
my CVS tree with me being the one who's expected to feed/justify it to
Linus.

You don't want writable XIP. You just think you do, because you work for a 
software company and you're not allowed to call the hardware designers 
naughty names when they fail to realise that compression is far more useful 
than XIP and also cheaper, in 99% of cases.
