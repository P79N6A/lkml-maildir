That's basically it. The bus should have already known about the existence
of the device, filled in the fields of struct device and registered it in
the global tree. 
As Jeff Garzik suggested: 
probe:
        register interface
        sanity check h/w to make sure it's there and alive
        stop DMA/interrupts/etc., just in case
        start timer to powerdown h/w in N seconds
in which interface would be your device node (char dev, devfs node, etc).
