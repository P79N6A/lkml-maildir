Well, I definitely wouldn't call it "buggy" ... skb_recv_datagram()
(if with sock->sk_rcvtimeo != MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT) would then
needlessly have to be put into it's own little while(1) (or put a
"continue;" after it back to main kthread loop). A question arises,
what timeout value to use? (too little => needless wastage of CPU;
too high => see below)
More importantly, the other thread that does a kthread_stop() on our
kthread (probably a umount(2) or rmmod) would then unfortunately hang
(on wait_for_completion i.e. TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) for the duration
of the time it takes for our kthread to finish it's timeout, which plays
havoc with userspace scripts.

That's fine, we can still "agree to disagree" here :-)
