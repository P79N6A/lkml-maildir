I'm still waiting for a proper description of things here.
Looking at the code, it looks like you have multiple clock sources and
selecting the best one dynamically. That's probably a nice feature, but
it should be possible to solve whilst still keeping calls going only
from sdhci to sdhci-s3c.
E.g. we could add a caps field (to keep quirks just for bugs) which
states "has multiple clock sources". Before the core changes the clock,
it calls ops->select_clock(target_hz), which changes clock source and
returns the new base frequency.
