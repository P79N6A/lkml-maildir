working on it...
2.6.24-rc6 + mm-patches up to git.battery (includes git-net and
git-netdev-all) worked for 110 packages, then I proclaimed it good.
2.6.24-rc6 + mm-patches up to (including) git.nfsd is currently
getting testet (9 packages done...)
But the cause of my mail is the following question:
Regarding my "iommu-sg-merging-patches are new in -rc3-mm and could be
the cause"-suspicion I looked at these patches and came across these
hunks:
This is removed from arch/x86/lib/bitstr_64.c:
-/* Find string of zero bits in a bitmap */
-unsigned long
-find_next_zero_string(unsigned long *bitmap, long start, long nbits, int len)
-{
-       unsigned long n, end, i;
-
- again:
-       n = find_next_zero_bit(bitmap, nbits, start);
-       if (n == -1)
-               return -1;
-
-       /* could test bitsliced, but it's hardly worth it */
-       end = n+len;
-       if (end > nbits)
-               return -1;
-       for (i = n+1; i < end; i++) {
-               if (test_bit(i, bitmap)) {
-                       start = i+1;
-                       goto again;
-               }
-       }
-       return n;
-}
This is added to lib/iommu-helper.c:
+static unsigned long find_next_zero_area(unsigned long *map,
+                                        unsigned long size,
+                                        unsigned long start,
+                                        unsigned int nr)
+{
+       unsigned long index, end, i;
+again:
+       index = find_next_zero_bit(map, size, start);
+       end = index + nr;
+       if (end > size)
+               return -1;
+       for (i = index + 1; i < end; i++) {
+               if (test_bit(i, map)) {
+                       start = i+1;
+                       goto again;
+               }
+       }
+       return index;
+}
The old version checks, if find_next_zero_bit returns -1, the new
version doesn't do this.
Is this intended and can find_next_zero_bit never fail?
Hmm... but in the worst case it should only loop forever if I'm
reading this right (index = -1 => for-loop counts from 0 to nr, if any
bit is set it will jump to "again:" and if the next call to
find_next_zero_bit also fails, its an endless loop)
So even if this can not explain my bug, could somebody check if this
is a real bug or not?
