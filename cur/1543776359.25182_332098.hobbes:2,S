Indeed. I've been thinking about this for some time, trying to determine
whether it's worth worrying about (if it's byte swapped then the version
code won't match) however you rightly point out the issue off shell
scripts. To that end I've cooked up a tiny patch which applies on top of
the previous one and will detect a byte swapped version code. My
preference for this over just using (for example) a big endian structure
is that it keeps the userspace side of things simple (no need to worry
about endianness there) however as I say I'm still not sure whether this
is the right way to deal with the problem.
