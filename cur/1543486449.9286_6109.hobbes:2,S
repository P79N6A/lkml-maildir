Woops.. didn't realize it was.. Sorry 'bout that..
Anyway, my question again is:
I installed Redhat 5.2 on my box which has a Advansys SCSI card (and a
different brand) installed.  Everything works fine.
I compiled the 2.2.1 kernel with the SCSI drivers in the kernel as opposed
to modules.  Now when I boot everything works fine but I get a message
saying /lib/advansys.o was compiled for kernel version 2.0.36.
This is correct in that that was the original version.  My question is:
Where is the insmod or similar command that is causing it to keep attempting
this?  I've greped just about everywhere I can think of and I still can't
find it.
Can anybody provide me with info on where I should be looking or how to see
which file is calling it?
