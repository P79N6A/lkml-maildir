Ahhh....  *That* code :)  Do you have an updated version you'd like to
share?  I'm curious how you integrated the suggestions from February.

Only during a defragment operation.  Are you planning to run the system
under constant defragmentation?

I think what you really want to do is keep anybody else from making a
new pte to the page, once you've invalidated all of the existing ones,
right?
Holding a lock_page() should do the trick.  Anybody that goes any pulls
the page out of the page cache has to do a lock_page() and check
page->mapping before they can establish a pte to it, so you can stop
that.  Since you're invalidating page->mapping before you move the page
(you *are* doing this, right?), it will end up working itself out.
