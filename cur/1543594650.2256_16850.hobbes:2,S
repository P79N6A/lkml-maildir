My cramfs ramdisk size is less then 4096, it is only 2304Kb.

And besides, i have been tried this option already.
But, thank you anyway, now i know that big cramfs initrd`s works.
Possibly, some symlinks are broken, or some libraries are missed, on my 
rootfs...
But it is very strange, that ext2fs ramdisk image works with the same 
rootfs on it.
I'll try to investigate it by myself.
