I think the main purpose of the reserved area is not to have it available
for data in case of an emergency, but to help keep the fragmentation low.
A decent filesystem should be able to maintain a low fragmentation but
these policies can not be applied if there is not enough free blocks -
basically the filesystem then has no choice about which blocks to use.
So 5% of a 8G fs are 400 MB, but this is considered as a good compromise
because you won't have to run defrag on your 8G volume every now and then.
