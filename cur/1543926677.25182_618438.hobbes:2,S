- cross platform extensible API for configuring perf counters
- support for multiplexed counters
- support for virtualized 64-bit counters
- support for PC and call graph sampling at specific intervals
- support for reading counters not necessarily with sampling
- taskswitch support for counters
- API available from userland
- ability to self-monitor: need select/poll/etc interface
- support for PEBS, IBS and whatever other new perf monitoring 
  infrastructure the vendors through at us in the future
- low overhead:  must minimize the "probe effect" of monitoring
- low noise in measurements:  cannot achieve this in userland
permon2 has all of this and more i've probably neglected...
