It doesn't.  The "all" means, all of them need to be added to
->show_options(), not that all are shown.
I can see now that this is slightly confusing, sorry.
So the ones that need attention are "all" and "some".  The others are
fine in theory.  Of course I may have missed something.

2.6.24 would be a nice, but it won't be easy...
