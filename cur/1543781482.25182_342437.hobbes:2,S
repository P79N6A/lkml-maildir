I think he was commenting more on the code indentation and braces  
placement
than any naming issue.  There was also a good guide to kernel whitespace
posted to the LKML a week or so ago, please check the archives and  
review
that as well.
I have one small comment on something you stated in your original mail:

I suggest that you revise this list to the following:

ptrace implies the ability to execute arbitrary code in the given  
process, which
means that even without this new function the calling process  
theoretically
could obtain and set rlimits for that process anyways, subject to its  
own
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability.  Such a situation would guarantee that  
there are
no new security holes, and would limit the number of inter-process  
access rules
which kernel developers need to understand.  I believe some simple  
Googling and
grepping through the kernel code should reveal the necessary ptrace- 
related
process checks.
Cheers,
