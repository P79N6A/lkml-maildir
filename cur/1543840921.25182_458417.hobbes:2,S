This all looks a bit too fresh and TODO-infested for me to put it in -mm at
this time.
I could toss them in to get some testing underway, but that makes life
complex for other ongoing MM work.  (And there's a _lot_ of that - I
presently have >180 separate patches which alter ./mm/*).
Also, it looks like another round of detailed review is needed before this
work will really start to settle into its final form.
So..   I'll await version 5, sorry.   Please persist.
