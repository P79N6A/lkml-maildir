And what happens if the CD already had a directory or file named audio in
it's root directory?  Adding files or directories for the audio tracks to
the same place as the data will always have the possibility of causing
problems.  2 seperate mount points like a audio and data directory under
the mount point, or having audio files in the root of the mount point and a
data directory under that are the only 2 ways I can think of doing it
without the possibility of naming conflicts.
