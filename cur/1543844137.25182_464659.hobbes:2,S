Ok, see my other email, we have the mmap_sem anyway so it's fine. Note
that I got a little bit mislead on that "we can wlak the page table
without mmap_sem" because we can on powerpc :) but possibly not on
x86.... we use RCU to free pagetable pages to make that possible because
our hash refill code (equivalent to our TLB miss if you want to see it
that way) has to be able to do that. I think the x86 MMU has some way to
atomically do the walking which is why you don't need that on x86 but I
don't know x86 so ...
Ben.
