I always thought that Linux striped through all configured swap
partitions, and I didn't need to do swap over RAID. In fact, if I
remember well, the documentation of the Raid tools says that swapping
over a striped device won't give better performance, because the kernel
already stripes swap partitions...
Seems that the guy who wrote the article is a bit misinformed...
