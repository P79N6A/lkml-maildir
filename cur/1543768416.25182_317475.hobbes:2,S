That was badly phrased ;)
What I meant was "I'm not sure if GPM is the cause of the behaviour I'm
seeing":
With GPM using "-t ps2" on 2.6.12-rc4, phantom clicks are occasionally
generated when typing, which I've never seen happen before.  Since
tapping didn't otherwise work during this test, it suggests that
something's not quite right...
I'm currently using GPM 1.20.1 - which I believe is the latest release -
which does allow "-t evdev".  Does this need any special configuration
over any other protocol?

Perhaps it might be prudent in this case to make the default behaviour
in 2.6.11+ kernels the same as previous kernels?

Ah - I tried using "psmouse.proto=exps2" as a kernel argument before
(with 2.6.11?) and it didn't fix things completely.  This has changed
though, and you're right that in 2.6.12 this completely restores the
original behaviour.
I'm also happy to test any further ALPS patches, if needs be...
