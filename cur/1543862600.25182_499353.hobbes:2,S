Yep.  bttv used to do that long time ago, and some people used to run
into trouble because the nvidia driver used lots of vmalloc address
space ...

video4linux drivers do this:
 (1) app opens /dev/video0
 (2) app issues some ioctls to set buffer count, format and size
 (3) app uses mmap(/dev/video0) to map the buffers.
Buffer memory is simple userspace memory, it is allocated by the nopage
handler.  Memory is pinned down by get_user_pages().

Look at drivers/media/video/video-buf.c, that is the buffer management
code shared by v4l drivers.  It should at least give an idea how it
works, not sure you can actually reuse the code.  Chances are not too
bad though, it is used not only for video buffers, but also for audio
and mpeg2 data, so it could be generic enough to fit your needs too.
cheers,
  Gerd
