Subject: [PATCH] Remove the deprecated "kmem_cache_t" typedef from slab.h.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/21/145

Given that there is no remaining usage of the deprecated kmem_cache_t
typedef anywhere in the tree, remove that typedef.
Signed-off-by: Robert P. J. Day <rpjday@mindspring.com>

this removal will, of course, break out-of-tree usage but this typedef
has been deprecated since Dec of 2006 (commit
1b1cec4bbc59feac89670d5d6d222a02545bac94) and since this won't go in
until 2.6.22, is six months enough time for constant build warnings to
convince people to stop using deprecated features?  :-)
