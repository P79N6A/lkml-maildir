I agree you cannot be perfect without cache splitting. I'm not
advocating this. We could improve access checking to the page cache
significantly --even in NFSv2-- by for example calling for a 1-byte
dummy read of the file in 'nfs_open()' if the file is to be opened for
reading. (Writing can of course not be handled like this).
Once you've opened the file though, whose credentials do you choose?
Are you advocating a pool of credentials held in the inode structure?
It's feasible, but I don't see why that would be cleaner. The inode is
a shared structure, so why clutter it up with user-specific
information, when you already have an alternative struct for keeping
that sort of info?
Finally, what is the interest of allowing users to spoof the server?
Granted that spoofing the client into allowing access to the page
cache can be damaging enough, but why should we go out of our way to
make it possible to spoof the server as well?

My objection to your point about moving the file handle into struct
address_space was not motivated by concerns about credentials, but
rather to the appropriateness of sticking a path-dependent object such
as the file handle into the inode.
