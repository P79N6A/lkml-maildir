I think this looks better than what we have now, but it would look even 
better if the core CPUID stuff was in arch/i386/kernel/cpu/amd.c, and we 
simply had X86_FEATURE_BROKEN_C1_LAPIC etc..
And then the apic.c code would just check
	if (boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_BROKEN_C1_LAPIC))
		return -1;
or similar.
Doing the same for C2 and C3 gives us a clean way to have all these 
per-vendor things in their relevant places, rather than having various 
vendor-specific checks sprinkled in random places..
That's *especially* true for something like this that can hit both on 
x86-64 and i386, where the cpuid logic is shared, but the APIC logic is 
*not* shared. If I read your patch correctly, this only fixes it on 32-bit 
platforms, and I don't think the problem is in any way 32-bit specific, is 
it?
