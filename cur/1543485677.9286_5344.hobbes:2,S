You can disable syslogd's syncing by prepending a '-' to the filename:
# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none                          -/var/log/messages
# The authpriv file has restricted access.
authpriv.*                                              -/var/log/secure
# Log all the mail messages in one place.
mail.*                                                  -/var/log/maillog
I have *destroyed* seagate scsi drives by syslog's fsync'ing too much.
(A syslog server handling 50 syslog lines/sec on average)
After 2 destroyed drives in 2 months, one learns rather quickly to turn
off fsync action.
