Weird, it wasn't intentional.  I read LKML in Gmail (which I don't use
for much else), and just clicked "reply", expecting to do the right
thing.  Replying to this email it's also left you off the CC list. 
Looking at the email source I believe it's probably to do with the
following:
Mail-Followup-To: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>,
	ross@jose.lug.udel.edu,
	Kernel Mailing List <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>> 
I've CC'd you explicitly on this.
