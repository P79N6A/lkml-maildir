It does work however. And if you sized a kernel before and after with old
gcc's at least the extern one was a clear winner.

At this point egcs really needs to invent a new "common inline" of some sort.
There are kernel cases where you need to force inlining and where you don't
want duplicated code all over the place caused by compiler weaknesses.
Granted talk is cheap, Im not an egcs hacker.
