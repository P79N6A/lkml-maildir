This makes sense to me.  When I attach a serial cable and use that to 
login (I've got agetty running), hdparm produces no console messages 
that I can see using minicom.  Still, the disk throughput is around 1.5 
MB/sec for some reason.  When I disable the serial console in grub.conf 
and reboot I get over 70 MB/sec again.
A combination of out-of-tree patches (mainly network related but also 
one to disable PM_TIMERS) seem to eliminate the issue even with the 
serial console enabled, at least for the moment.  That means I no longer 
have a problem, but the whole thing is mysterious to me.
