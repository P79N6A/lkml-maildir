Hi there,
System Configuration...
LSI Megaraid 320-1 SCSI Card
Redhat ES 3 , build 3
Boot loader : lilo
I'm running Redhat ES 3 release and after much struggle finally  succeeded 
in compiling the kernel successfully.... I hope :). I'm getting the 
following problems after I've rebooted the system on the newly installed 
kernel.
Now I've done some reading on google about this and the only thing I could 
find was that I should try to change (append="root=LABEL=/") to the actual 
device name where root can be found. I got the same affect.....
Any ideas would be apreciated.
