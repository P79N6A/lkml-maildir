  The  'struct pci_id_info'  is so far used only by network driver cards
  which Donald Becker has written ( in  drivers/net/*.c ), and they have
  hand-coded matcher literals:
struct pci_id_info {
	const char *name;
	struct match_info {
		int	pci, pci_mask, subsystem, subsystem_mask;
		int revision, revision_mask;	/* Only 8 bits. */
	} id;
	enum pci_id_flags_bits pci_flags;
	int io_size;		/* Needed for I/O region check or ioremap(). */
	int drv_flags;		/* Driver use, intended as capability flags. */
};
static struct pci_id_info pci_id_tbl[] = {
	{"Yellowfin G-NIC Gigabit Ethernet", { 0x07021000, 0xffffffff},
	 PCI_IOTYPE, YELLOWFIN_SIZE,
	 FullTxStatus | IsGigabit | HasMulticastBug | HasMACAddrBug},
	{"Symbios SYM83C885", { 0x07011000, 0xffffffff},
	 PCI_IOTYPE, YELLOWFIN_SIZE, HasMII },
	{0,},
};
...
static struct pci_id_info pci_tbl[] = {
	{ "Digital DC21040 Tulip", { 0x00021011, 0xffffffff },
	  TULIP_IOTYPE, TULIP_SIZE, DC21040 },
	{ "Digital DC21041 Tulip", { 0x00141011, 0xffffffff },
	  TULIP_IOTYPE, TULIP_SIZE, DC21041 },
	{ "Digital DS21140 Tulip", { 0x00091011, 0xffffffff },
	  TULIP_IOTYPE, TULIP_SIZE, DC21140 },
	{ "Digital DS21143 Tulip", { 0x00191011, 0xffffffff },
	  TULIP_IOTYPE, TULIP_SIZE, DC21142 },
...
	Right, so these magic literal tokens have low 16 bits of
	vendor ID (0x1011 = DEC), while upper 16 bits of those 32-
	bits are device id.  (0x0019 = DEC 21143 - per 21143 docs)
	There is *one* driver where  subsystem_mask == 0, but
	revision_mask is non-zero.  That isn't Tulip.
	Thus while the original change of  pci_id  formation is
	very sensible (to match how Becker's drivers are written),
	the subsystem does not have any *usage* where to match it..
	(Especially not Tulip..)
	With this in mind, perhaps subsys-vendor should stay as the
	low part, like Alan says.
