Please exclude builds with CONFIG_STANDALONE=n.
And please don't send every new error you are finding to this list.
As I've already said generating the errors is the the easy part -
analyzing them is the real work.
It would be best if you would do this yourself and send specific bug 
reports (or even patches) for the problems you've find.
If you want to publish the errors you've found, send a pointer to a 
location where it is available _once_ and update the information there.
This is e.g. how Jan Dittmer is doing it with his very valuable cross 
compile site [1] - he doesn't send daily emails but if I want to know 
the information I can always find it there.
