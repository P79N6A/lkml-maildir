Very true. I devised something to address this that appears to work on
multiple architectures already by folding ->zone into ->flags, which
could be useful. (Dave Jones recommended I just let arch maintainers
for things other than i386 mess with page_address() for other arches.)
OTOH, I'm more interested in getting it trimmed down than getting credit.
Cheers,
Bill
P.S.:
My i386 version, which makes ->virtual conditional on CONFIG_HIGHMEM as
well, is at:
