Sorry to upset you for this reformatting. What I did was look at the I/O Controller Hub of the intel 8xx series of chipsets and had a look what was supported and what was not. The 82801CA and 82801CAM I/O Controller Hubs were not supported yet and thus I added support for this in the IDE code, the watchdog timer and the random number generator. These Hubs will support intel 830 and intel 830MP (and probably others in the future as well) series of motherboards. 
My main source of info was the datasheets from intel on the different 82801 chips.

I checked why I changed to the square brackets: they are normally used when you need to strip if the
description is too long. In this case it indeeds make no sense. Sorry about this.
Greetings,
Wim.
