Ahhh.  I hadn't made the ia64 connection.  I wonder if it is worth
making CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE say ia64 or something about vmem_map in it
somewhere.  Might be worth at least a comment like this:
+               if (page_in_zone_hole(buddy)) /* noop on all but ia64 */
+                       break;
+               else if (page_zonenum(buddy) != page_zonenum(page))
+                       break;
+               else if (!page_is_buddy(buddy, order))
                        break;          /* Move the buddy up one level. */
BTW, wasn't the whole idea of discontig to have holes in zones (before
NUMA) without tricks like this? ;)
