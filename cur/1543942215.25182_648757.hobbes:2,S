Instead of reverting the patch can you try modifying
this part of the patch:
+	if (wait_event_interruptible_timeout(tty->write_wait,
+			!tty->driver->chars_in_buffer(tty), timeout))
+		return;
by changing it to:
+	if (wait_event_interruptible_timeout(tty->write_wait,
+			!tty->driver->chars_in_buffer(tty), timeout) < 0)
+		return;
It looks like the patch changed the behavior of
tty_wait_until_sent by not calling the driver
specific wait_until_sent if a timeout occurs.
