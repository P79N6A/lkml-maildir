Cdparanoia was not updated since 2001. The here important low level code is 
still the same as with cdda2wav from 1997.
For this reason, I did create a portable libparanoia from the assets of the 
cdparanoia code and also fixed several bugs in the paranoia code.
We then added this code to a recent cdda2wav in April 2002.
People need to learn that cdparanoia is dead and no longer maintained by Monty.
Monty is working on other software now. A recent maintained version is here:
