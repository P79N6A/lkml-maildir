Really?
Can you demonstrate the problem with the 5703 without bridging?
Can you demonstrate the problem with bridging and another checksum
capable card?
Unless you can answer both those questions, I think faulting this
5703 variant is premature.  It smells more like a briding bug to
me, perhaps it's corrupting the hw checksumming state of an SKB
as it passes through the bridging layer.
