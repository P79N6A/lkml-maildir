Hi all,
I wrote a GPL device driver for a PCI board, by Bihl-Wiedemann. The
device is this one:
http://www.bihl-wiedemann.de/englisch/catalog/1195.html
The code is based on an old device driver, by Ludolf Holzheild of
Bihl-Wiedemann, written for kernel 2.0 and early versions of 2.2. I
added some functions and ported it to 2.4 and 2.6.
The driver works fine, at least for the testing I did. Anyway since it's
my first attempt to a device driver, it may need some lifting.
Furthermore I used major number 60, since this driver doesn't have a
proper one.
Who should I send the driver to? Andrew Morton?
Cheers,
Filippo Carone
