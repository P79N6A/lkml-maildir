Could you take out the vpurr stuff please?  I know that it is all
inside #ifdef CONFIG_PPC_VPURR, and there is currently no way for that
to be defined, but it would be cleaner without it.
The vpurr stuff in ameslab is a bit problematic at present since it
will interact badly with hotplug cpu, according to Anton.  I think
the vpurr stuff could be done very simply with a couple of lines of
code in timer_interrupt.
Paul.
