The boot protocol 256-byte limitation applies only to protocol version
2.01 or earlier.  After that, there is still a 256-byte *KERNEL*
limitation, but it is not a *PROTOCOL* limitation.  In other words,
the kernel can, and should be, upgraded; in fact, a gentleman by the
name of Alon Bar-Lev has submitted that patch several times already;
it wasn't accepted because of an unsubstantiated report that it broke
LILO, the veracity of which I think is in serious doubt.
