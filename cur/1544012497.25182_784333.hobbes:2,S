the weak functions should be close to where the code that uses them is - 
not somewhere separate (where no-one will really be aware of their 
existence). So either we find a way to avoid such repeat bugs in the 
future, or we do away with weak functions altogether and go back to 
stone-age #ifdefs ;-)
I think we should get a Sparse check that detects empty void __weak 
functions?
