Hi,
I noticed today that I got several time the following error log in my
/var/log/messages:
Mar 16 14:00:59 hermes vmunix: atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated
set 2,
code 0x7a on isa0060/serio0).
Mar 16 14:00:59 hermes vmunix: atkbd.c: This is an XFree86 bug. It
shouldn't access hardware directly.
