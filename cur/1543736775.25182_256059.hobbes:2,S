No and such workaround won't work anyway because
re-register operation is nothing else but unregister+register.
hotswap is currently unsupported, some TODO items:
- convert IDE driver to use dynamic objects instead of static ones
- add needed refcounting and locking
- convert IDE driver to new driver-model
- add full sysfs support
- add hotswap
Any help/support is appreciated.
