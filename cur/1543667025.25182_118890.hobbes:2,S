You're in luck, as noted in the follow up, I captured it all..

The tricky thing about capturing this one was that something in the VFS
was wedged hard, so I'm lucky the logs made it to disk.
Using sysrq, I synced and the disks made really nasty chugging noises.
umount read only made it write a bunch of stuff out, more chugging
noises for 15 minutes, kill all tasks then popped up a getty for me to
log in on. It took about 3 minutes to get a shell (disk IO was seriously
slow). I took a peek at vmstat 1 (no logs of this sorry), and nothing
out of the ordinary. Not much in swap, plenty of swap free.
short: the machine was horked. I synced, and rebooted, and thankfully
the logs were still there after fsck.ext2 recovered /var
