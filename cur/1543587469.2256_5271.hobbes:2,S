Right, it needs to go, we need to eliminate the "lumps" in time :)

I must be missing something here.  You get log(n) from what?  B-trees? 
How would you manage them to get the needed balance?  Stopping the world
to re-balance is worse than the cascade.  I guess I need to read up on
this stuff.  A good pointer would be much appreciated. 
Meanwhile, I keep thinking of a simple doubly linked list in time
order.  To speed it up keep an array of pointers to the first N whole
jiffie points and maybe pointers to coarser points beyond the first N. 
Make N, say 512.  Build the pointers as needed.  This should give
something like O(n/N) insertion and O(1) removal.
