Yes. While in the read side, preemption will have to be disabled
to prevent local pointers being carried across context switches.
It isn't impossible to allow preemption, but that makes the
quiescent point detection logic much more complicated.

Perhaps I am missing something here but shouldn't the refcount based 
schemes anyway have to do this with or without RCU ? If you do
	unhash
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&count))
		free_it();
the isn't it that if refcount is not 0, sometime later it will have to be 
cleaned up by some garbage collection scheme ? Whatever that scheme is, 
it still needs to be made certain that the element is not back in the 
hash table.  It seems to me that with RCU the same logic can be made use of.
So instead of doing 
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&count))
		rcu_free_it()
you may do 
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&count))
		free_it();
where in free_it()
	if (atomic_read(&count))
		return;
	rcu_free_it();
Of course, there may be more complicated freeing schemes for which
we may need additional logic just like you suggested.

One RCU example for refcount + hash table is at
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/patches/rt_rcu-2.4.6-02.patch
(ipv4 route cache).
