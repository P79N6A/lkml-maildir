Subject: Load hid.o module synchronously?

I am using the 2.6.5 kernel on a modular boot disk.  I am finding that
invocations of "modprobe" are returning sooner than I would like.
For example, I invoke "modprobe hid" to make my USB keyboard work.
This loads the module and exits immediately, causing my script to
proceed, before the USB keyboard is probed and ready.
I want to wait until the driver is finished initializing (i.e., a USB
keyboard is either found or not found) before my script continues.
How can I do that?
I seem to be having similar problems loading certain other modules
(PCMCIA, Ethernet), but hid.o is the only one for which I have not
found a convenient workaround.
I apologize if this is a stupid question.  I have spent some time
searching both the Linux source code and the linux-kernel archives to
no avail.
Thanks!
