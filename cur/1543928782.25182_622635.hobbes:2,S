Yeah, thanks for reminding me about this particular insanity.
We should just make the kernel always use %gs for the percpu data. On 
32-bit x86 there really is no reason to use %fs over %gs, other than the 
purely historical one, and the fact that "f" is alphabetically before "g", 
so it's the one you use first if you have no other preferences.
That way we can more easily share code, if the rules for fs/gs are the 
same for 32-bit/64-bit code.
However, you also say:

but I'm not seeing the reason for that one. Care to comment more? (Yes, 
there is often a latency from segment reload to use, but the reload 
latency for system call exit *should* be entirely covered by the cost of 
doing the system call return itself, no?)
