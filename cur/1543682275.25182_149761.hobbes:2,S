And that's the problem.  The new modprobe uses /etc/modprobe.conf rather than 
/etc/modules.conf.  In Debian you now need to put the component files into 
/etc/modprobe.d instead of /etc/modutils.  However the syntax appears to be 
mostly the same so the configuration files you already have should still 
work.
