2.5.72-mm3 is fine for modem usage for me.
2.5.73-mm1 threw this all 3 times I tried starting PPPD:
Jun 24 22:37:48 turing-police pppd[1144]: Using interface ppp0
Jun 24 22:37:48 turing-police pppd[1144]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS14
Jun 24 22:37:49 turing-police pppd[1144]: sent [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 <asyncmap 0x0> <magic 0x9ed88e38> <pcomp> <accomp>]
Jun 24 22:37:49 turing-police pppd[1144]: Modem hangup
Jun 24 22:37:49 turing-police pppd[1144]: Connection terminated.
i.e. it died a quick and horrid death.  I've not checked a plain 2.5.73 yet,
but I suspect this is the most likely culprit:
#	           ChangeSet	1.1348.1.42 -> 1.1348.1.43
#	 drivers/net/pppoe.c	1.31    -> 1.32   
#	drivers/net/ppp_generic.c	1.33    -> 1.34   
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 03/06/23	shemminger@osdl.org	1.1348.1.43
# [NET]: Convert PPPoE to new style protocol.
# --------------------------------------------
(if only because it's the only changeset that hits ppp_generic.c between
the known good and known bad versions).  If a clean 2.5.73 works, then
reverting this cset is probably the best place to start looking...
