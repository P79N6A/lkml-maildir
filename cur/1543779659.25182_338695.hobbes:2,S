Hi,
my box with nForce2 doesn't turn off automatically with 2.6.13-rc5 
(perhaps also with -rc4). Everything seems to go as it should (both with 
"poweroff" and <Ctrl><SysRq><O>) (even disks park) except for the actual 
turn-off.
With -rc3 it works fine.
Martin
P.S.: It's a Gigabyte 7NNXP with latest BIOS.
