I've got a DPT SmartCACHE IV with the raid adaptor... I'd like to get it
working eventually. If you point me in the right direction I'll see if I
can get that pesky driver to work, and even port over some code if need
be....all someone has to do is point me towards documnentation and I'll
make it work.
thanks,
kelsey
