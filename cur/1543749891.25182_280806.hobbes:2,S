Hmm, I'm not real sure of that Christoph - this was inside a
kernel thread (xfsbufd) where there is almost nothing on the
stack at the point we dove into driver land.  Looked like a
genuine bug to me.  There were plenty of calls on the trace,
but I think several of those were badly guessed by the stack
dump code.  And a couple of registers having a memory poison
pattern looked a bit suspect.

Certainly wasn't XFS using stack in the initial oops, perhaps
the lower layers, but I'm a bit sceptical.  Almost certainly
this is a device mapper snapshot problem, the DM folks should
be able to analyse it further.
cheers.
