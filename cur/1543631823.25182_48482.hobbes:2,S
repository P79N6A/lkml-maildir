I think I was looking at 4.3Tahoe, but it doesn't matter, what I was 
thinking about was your comment about frags, that makes things quite 
different.  And I know, err, am pretty sure, that by this point Kirk
had worked over the allocation policy to keep things in the same
cylinder group when possible and I don't think that the original
file system was quite as careful.

Yup, got it.  I've had some fun in there.

Yes, I know, it's on my list of things to do.  There are some compat issues,
it isn't a trivial thing, but we can and will do it.  Another thing I plan
to do is to build up BK repositories of all the BSD docs as well as all the
troff docs.  I really like troff, I'm not a fan of latex or word, troff 
still works better for me but I think many people abandoned it out of a 
lack of documentation.  And when that's done, I'll make man page versions
of all the stupid info stuff so I can say "man whatever" and get what 
I need.
Wandering well into the weeds....
