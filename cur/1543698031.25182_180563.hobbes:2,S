Ah, yes... -j3 gets me 2 cpp/cc pairs as well. 
What I see with -j3 is 1 parent make process and two make child processes.
With -j2 I see one parent and one child. Leaving -j off entirely gives the same
as -j2. 
-j3:
root     25314 15539  0 Nov27 tty1     00:00:00 make -j3 bzImage
root     25545 25314  0 Nov27 tty1     00:00:00 make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=arch/i386/kernel
root     25814 25314  0 Nov27 tty1     00:00:00 make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=kernel
-j2:
root     26391 15539  0 Nov27 tty1     00:00:00 make -j2 bzImage
root     26582 26391  0 Nov27 tty1     00:00:00 make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=init
