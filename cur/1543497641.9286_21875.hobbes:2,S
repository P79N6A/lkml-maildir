Don't forget that it is unlikely that a new protocol will be invented
to support zero-copy. Therefore we have the problem of:
(1)  Get only IP header from controller.
(2)  Process header to see who/what/why/where.
(3)  Page in user buffer, could start on any boundary. Could be too
     small for the whole packet. In the meantime more packets are
     arriving.
(4)  Copy or DMA user data. 
(5)  Checksum the whole thing, i.e., header which is somewhere in the
     kernel, plus the user data.
(6)  Checksum is bad.  Zero out user data, ignore IP header.
(7)  Packet arrived out-of order, allocate a buffer for it, copy from
     user buffer to allocated buffer. Zero out user data.
(8)  Packet is okay, see if more room in user buffer, if so adjust
     pointers and branch to (1)
(9)  Wake user.
It seems to me that it's just more efficient to copy to kernel buffers
as is done, then pack buffers and copy data to user-space when requested.
A user should not be required to have a read() or recv() in the queue
at all times which would seem to be a requirment for a system that
is able to send directly from the hardware to the user. Presently, with
connected sockets, the kernel will accumulate data so when a user wants
it, it is available.
