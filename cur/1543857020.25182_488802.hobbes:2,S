I provided a patch a couple weeks ago when I brought this topic up 
myself, but it was largely ignored because it wasn't the "add something 
to help dialog" solution... I figured that the wording would be changed 
anyway by the ide / libata guys or anyone else really involved with the 
kernel.  So I opted to provide a patch that did one of the other 
solutions, namely, adding fake libata block devices in the libata 
section that would merely enable the scsi blk dev variables as if you 
had gone into the scsi section and did it the way it's currently done.  
In any case, prior to this thread, I got basically no response on the 
matter. 
Your patch, however, should at least get into the next kernel revision 
with any additional help text that may be of use. 
Thanks.
