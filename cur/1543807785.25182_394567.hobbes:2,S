making it harder for the user is a good thing, but please not at the
expense of usability
the only way i see a user can have data loss is if
- a md array is stopped
- two different filesystems are created on the component devices
- these filesystems are filled with data, but not to the point of
  damaging the superblock
- then the array is started again.
if only one device is removed using mdadm the event counter would
prevent the array from being assembled again.
there are a lot of easier ways for shooting yourself in the feet :)
if we really want to be paranoid we should modify mkXXXfs to refuse
creating a filesystem if the device has an md superblock on it. (lvm2
tools are already able to ignore devices with md superblocks on them,
no clue about EVMS)
