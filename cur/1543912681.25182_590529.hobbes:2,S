It's once per second if the cpu is 100% busy, if it's just idling and
halted, the performance counters won't be increased.

With the same load on the box? Maybe some other changes caused the box
to behave differently (say, CFS), regarding eg. load distribution
amongst the cores.

At least from the interrupt side, that box looks pretty idle, so that's
expected I'd say.

Ok, dumb I am.
The "interesting" call from p6_rearm passes NULL as desc, and thus the
printk is never called that way. But before we start flooding your logs,
could you just hog all cores with a simple cpu hog and check if that
causes the NMI counter to increase at about 1 Hz? If that doesn't work,
we can go back to that debug output.
