From Hannu message:
"I think the ideal solution would be that both ALSA and OSS APIs can 
co-exist by sharing the same low level drivers (which has
already been demonstrated). The low level driver interfaces in both 
systems are practically identical. This means that ALSA's
core can work with OSS' drivers and vice versa."
So Hannu have plan for share ALSA low level drivers without changes 
(porting to OSS will not be neccessary and/or will need only small 
amount of time .. IMO much less than make ALSA fully functional).
Main diffrences between ALSA and OSS are above low level drivers so IMO it 
is completly possible have ALSA and OSS in the same tree.
OSS wtil not dies (and try resurect) ALSA still (after few years) was not 
born and still isn't rock solid point odf Linux desktop (IMO it is most 
weeknes ponit of LD). IMO it will be better if Hannu will start pushing 
any OSS chages to Linus tree. Current OSS code in Linus tree is more or 
less not useable so allow maintain this code in main tree can't hurd 
anything outside this area.
