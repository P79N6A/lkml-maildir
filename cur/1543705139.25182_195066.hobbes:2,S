Depends on what they do, of course.  It _is_ fine for 2D office work,
that surprised me quite a bit. I can even use mplayer and watch
videos on this. 
Someone interested in quake will of course not be satisfied though.

Good point.  I had the impression you weren't going for the
best performance anyway.

The pc doesn't need VGA anymore than a Sun does.  A pc without any vga
runs the same stuff as the sun - various unixes and no legacy dos stuff.
Don't confuse "pc" with "msdos/windows".  If the sun's software
selection satisfy you, then you're fine on a pc/x86 without vga (or other
legacy hw) too.

Seems the solution is to get one of those general purpose GPU's
instead, and build the card around that.  Not entirely open hw,
but _fully documented_ with no hidden surprises.
