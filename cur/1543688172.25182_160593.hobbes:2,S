Well, the difficult part is deciding in time_init() if we are going to
use HPET without touching the hardware (to say, check if its actually
there).

We could pick a simple time source (ie: PIT) that would get us through
early boot, then choose the real time source in late_time_init(). That
would also make implementing the ACPI PM time-source much simpler as we
could wait until after ACPI is up, letting us avoid having to parse the
tables by hand.
However I'm not sure it would be trivial and bug free. ;)
