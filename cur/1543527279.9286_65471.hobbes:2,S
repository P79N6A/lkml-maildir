What kind of explanation is this. Of course I'll find in the sources
that the system does what is coded in the sources ... surprise.
The point is that on all other *nixes (as reported in the Tcl-newsgroup) 
the behaviour is different. getcwd does return `permission denied' if
the x-flag of the current dir or any of its parents is not present.
But maybe all other systems are not POSIX and Linux is or Linux knows
better than POSIX?
