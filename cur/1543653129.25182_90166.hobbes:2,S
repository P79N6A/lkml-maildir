What is really strange, is that while I run the following in the
boodscripts:
echo "90 500 0 0 600000 600000 95 20 0" > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
elvtune /dev/hda1 -r 2048 -w 131072
I never experience those stalls at all!
And that was surely I was expecting (clean buffers at 90% and do that
synchronouse at 95% gives little room for the first to complete before new
buffers get dirty. also that elevator-fiddling should force large bursts
(why am I doing this anyway? I wanted to configure the kernel et al so that
as minimal as possible disk-reads/writes occur))
