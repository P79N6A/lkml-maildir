Does such a daemon currently exist? Even then, is there any way to
police all unprivileged RT apps without introducing an O(N) operation
running continuously at max rt priority? Sort of defeats the purpose of
having an O(1) scheduler, no? I assume the RT check can be some in O(1)
time in the kernel, right?
About Ubuntu, I agree it wasn't a smart thing to do (I'm not an Ubuntu
devel, so I don't know what the reason was), but it would be nice if
this could be fixed without having to entirely remove the unprivileged
real-time feature. In the end, I'm not sure what the best solution is
(just an RT audio developer).
