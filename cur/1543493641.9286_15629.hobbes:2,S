Hi all!
I've got an idea to emulate filesystem on audio CDs, so every
track on audio CD would look like one (optionally WAV) file.
The fs uses ioctl's from cd drivers (uniform CDROM interface is a
great thing :), so it (should) work on any drive supported by
cd drivers.
The fs is not perfect, not ultra-fast, and (so far) has poor
jitter-correction, but i think it's a nice thing to have. There
are no _known_ bugs.
There's a patch for 2.2.x (i've made it on 2.2.2) on
