Guennadi,
I have watched this and even if UDMA is not supported cleanly by the
drive, the classic ATA-2 Multi-wrod DMA should be.  There was a time in
the past where WDC had some problems, but they have fixed most if not all
with "modern" drives.  I will be at WDC in two weeks, and I can raise the
issues with them.  Please spell them out completely.
Regards,

Then WHAT ON THE EARTH??? Mike, have you been able to recall what BIOS option turned DMA on? Shall I write to Andre Hedrick directly? Or is there a mailing-list smth. like linux-ide?
