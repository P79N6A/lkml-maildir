Martin's original bug report stated "now I loose ACPI events after 
suspend/resume. not every time, but roughly 3 out of 4 times."
This seems to support your theory.
But considering that two people have independently reported this as a 
2.6.19-rc regression for similar hardware (Michael for a T60 and Martin 
for an X60), a problem in the kernel seems to be involved.
Martin, Michael, can you send complete "dmesg -s 1000000" for both 
2.6.18.1 and a non-working 2.6.19-rc kernel after resume?
I don't have high hopes, but perhaps looking at the dmesg and/or 
diff'ing them might give a hint.
