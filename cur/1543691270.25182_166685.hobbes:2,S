That's exactly what happend.
Under /usr/local/bin/gcc I have gcc-3.0.2 (cvs) and I recently
made a symlink /usr/local/bin/cc to it.
While I put /usr/bin (where gcc-2.95.3 is installed) first in my path
when compiling the kernel, I didn't do so, when (re)making the
kernel modules from Nvidia. This worked fine since the only  cc
was /usr/bin/cc which pointed to /usr/bin/gcc .
I have (re)made Nvidia's module with gcc-2.95.3 and it runs fine
now with 2.4.13-pre6 .
Sorry for the noise.
Helmut.
