Ok, got your point. Maybe we can have a flag for this, as you suggested.
But, default behavior IMHO should be _not_ to undo partial allocation
(thus the file system will have the option of supporting this flag or
not and it will be inline with posix_fallocate; XFS will obviously
like to support this flag, inline with its existing behavior).

I can't think of a good reason for this (i.e. returning stale data from
preallocated blocks). It is infact a security issue to me.
Anyhow, this may though be beneficial for file systems which have
noticable overhead in marking the blocks "uninitialized/preallocated".
Can you or David please throw some light on how this option might really
be helpful ? Thanks!
