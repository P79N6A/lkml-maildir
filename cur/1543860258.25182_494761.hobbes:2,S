No, regular old PS/2 keyboard, directly connected. Due to that exact 
uneventfullness and having seen it reported before recently (*) I 
assumed everyone was seeing this. If not, I guess I can try to narrow it 
down.
It's easy to test for anyone willing: just boot with "root=/dev/null" or 
something as a kernel param. The printk's are in sync with the panic 
code blinking the leds.
(*) Here there was supposed to be a link to the post I was refferring 
to, but googling for it led to

Dmitry, could you ask Linus to pull the change? I find this to be an 
exceedingly annoying bug. It's just so incredibly silly, having one part 
of the kernel helpfully blink leds at you with another part going "hey, 
dude! don't do that!"
