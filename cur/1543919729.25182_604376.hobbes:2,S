Umm...  Dies much faster here:
include/asm-um/arch:
        @echo '  SYMLINK $@'
ifneq ($(KBUILD_SRC),)
        $(Q)mkdir -p $(objtree)/include/asm-um
        $(Q)ln -fsn $(srctree)/include/asm-$(SUBARCH) include/asm-um/arch
else
        $(Q)cd $(TOPDIR)/include/asm-um && ln -sf ../asm-$(SUBARCH) arch
endif
gives a symlink from include/asm-um/arch to include/asm-i386 or
include/asm-x86_64, so e.g.
#ifndef __UM_POSIX_TYPES_H
#define __UM_POSIX_TYPES_H
#include "asm/arch/posix_types.h"
#endif
in asm-um/posix_types.h blows instantly.  Try to build on a tree without
stale symlinks...
