Hi all,
I could not find good documentation anywhere on the memory usage of
linux, or rather, how to interpret the output of the various tools
dealing with memory consumption.
First of, generally - there's resident, virtual and shared memory for
each process, and global buffers/cache.
Global cache is easy to understand - file system / inode caches. What
exactly is buffers, though?
How do virtual, resident and shared memory relate to each other, though?
From my observation I assume:
- Virtual: All of the memory the program has allocated, including
overcommitted heap
- Resident: The actually used memory, including mmap()ed files whether
they are locked into memory or not (?)
- Shared: Dynamic libraries that are shared among multiple programs,
shared memory, and mmap()ed files
How are mmap()ed files handled in the global scheme of the kernel memory
management anyway? It seems they are not deducted from the globally
available memory unless explicitly locked with MAP_LOCKED?
And, how does process memory relate to system memory? Usually the sum of
the resident memory (ps -o rss) is way off from the used memory
displayed by free. I'm posting data from two machines down below, where
you can see discrepancies in either direction, in one case 2G more free
than resident, in the other case 60M less.
Is there a way to get more detailed information on process and kernel
memory usage? I assume that dm-crypto and software-raid use memory that
does not show up anywhere.
Best regards,
Christian

dynamips and vmware both mmap() the ram of the emulated machines
(dynamips emulates cisco routers). Still, obviously the majority of the
resident memory is "free", or rather "cached".
