Subject: UPDATED v3][PATCH 2/7] regulator: regulator driver interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/6/310

This interface allows regulator drivers to register their voltage and current
regulators with the core. It also has a notifier call chain for propagating
regulator events to clients.
