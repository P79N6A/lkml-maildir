Correct, it only has information which would help tune the setup you first described (the 2.2 setup for your client).
The individuals doing the technical side of that company have a high level of knowledge regarding Linux kernel issues which affect Squid performance and can /possibly/ discuss 2.4 vs. BSD issues with you if you ask.
However, for your client I believe the "technical information" would not be as useful as demonstrated performance.  I can't imagine that testing squid would require that much effort when compared to porting resierfs.
It's up to you of course.
