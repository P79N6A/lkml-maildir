Stelian: Okay, thanks for testing it.
Stelian and others:  So the fix works using is_sony_vaio_laptop
to set the pnp_bios_dont_use_current_config flag.  (Alan can
shorten this name if he wants ;)  The is_sony_vaio_laptop
flag is only found in the i386 and x86_64 arches.  Is the
pnpbios driver used on other arches?  If so then we'll have
to provide the flag in those arches or pnpbios won't link.
Alan?
