Hi,
I have been playing with testing 4000 disk support. (using 32bit dev_t).
I created 4000 disks using scsi_debug and mounted them.
We consumed 84MB of low memory by just mouting 4000 filesystems.
Out of 84MB lowmem 48MB is in slabs. 33 MB is used by buffers.
Here are the slabs which used more than 1MB. 
32MB is used by size-8192 slab. (super block ?)
Anything else interesting ? I guess i can try nobh mount option.
