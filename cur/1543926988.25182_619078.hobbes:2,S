Hello!

It is bound only to the fact that linux uses protocol address
of the machine, which responds. It would be highly confusing
(more than confusing :-)), if we used our protocol address and hardware
address of requestor.
But if you use zero protocol address as source, you really can use
any hw address.

1. Do not do this. Mainly, because you already know that this does not work
   with linux. :-) Logically, target hw address in arp reply is just
   a nonsensial redundancy, it should not be checked and even looked at.
2. What's about your suggestion, I thought about this and I am going to agree.
   Arguments, which convinced me are:
   - arping still works.
   - any piece of reasonable software should work.
   - if Windows understands DaD (is it really true? I cannot believe)
     and it is unhappy about our responce and does not block use
     of duplicate address only due to this, we _must_ accomodate ASAP.
   - if we do,we have to use 0 protocol address, no choice.
