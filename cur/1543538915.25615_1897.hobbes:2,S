After doing a grep, there are no other occurances that I could find. Maybe
the maintainer of osf_sys.c might want to look at it?

(poll.h breakage)
[snip]
This patch restores - in a very hacky way - compilation of the kernel on the
alpha. Someone with a (much) greater understanding of poll.h should grep
their way through the kernel sources and have a go at fixing up the other
breakages.
