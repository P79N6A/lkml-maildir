} 128K kmallocs often fail. Probably something like a 32K kmalloc limit
} with vmalloc if the kmalloc fails or >32K ?
} 
This would be sensible. I really just copied what was in fs/open.c
"alloc_fd_array()" function. But, then, it could become icky if we have
to determine how to free this area if, say, the 32K kmalloc fails and we
have to vmalloc the area. I think flags are cheesy :-).
