2.7.0, anyone?
I think it would be nice to put printk()s in /proc/ppc64 handler
functions in early 2.7 and print out the task names along with a message
asking the user to report them.  That way, we can more easily track down
all of the users.  
The code would come back out before the next stable kernel.
