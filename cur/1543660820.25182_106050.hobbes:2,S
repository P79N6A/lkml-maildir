Right.  And because of that I don't feel bad about asking for a zone
that ends at 4GB, as it is a fairly general need in the kernel, even
if the rest of the interfaces have a little catching up to do before
the can use it.  Although with IOMMUs I don't know how much such a
DMA32 zone is worth.

I am fine with memory that is not physically contiguous.  The memory
I really want the kernel is currently sitting on.....

The largest I have heard of is currently is 96MB.   Typical is
somewhere between 900K and 6MB.  You get some interesting
kernel+ramdisk combinations when people are network booting a diskless
system.   Theoretically I can accommodate a nearly 4GB image, with the
current code structure. 
So the 4GB instead of 960MB limit, and not pesimizing the kernel for
the cases where the new image sits in ram for a while (kexec on panic)
is while I modified my code to use high memory.
The nasty case comes with highmemory when I am allocating memory on a
32GB NUMA box and am allocating memory on the wrong node.  In which
case my code needs to allocate 28GB before it starts getting the
memory it wants.
