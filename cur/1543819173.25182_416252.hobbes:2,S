Yeah, we already know this.  The -rt patch was what showed the problem,
not the reason I was writing these patches.

Yep, you're right here, and it bothers me too that this slows down
performance.

It's because I'm anal retentive :-)
I noticed that the current solution is somewhat a hack, and thought
maybe it could be done cleaner.  Perhaps I'm wrong and the hack _is_ the
best solution, but it doesn't hurt in trying to improve it.  Or the very
least, prove that the current solution is the way to go.
I'm not trying to solve an issue with the -rt patch and tracing, I'm
just trying to make Linux a little more efficient in saving space. And
you may be right that we cant do that without hurting performance, and
thus we keep things as is.  But I don't want to give up without a fight
and miss something that can solve all this and keep Linux the best OS on
the market! (not to say that it isn't even with the current solution)
