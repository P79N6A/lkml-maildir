Hi,
I have linux box with 70GB SW Raid1. This box runs for half
a year without problems but now I meet the high cpu load 
problems. I suspect that it can be caused by not enough 
free disk space on this md device. I see following:
1 GB free  - load > 5
5 GB free  - load < 1
I have to notice that this box is rather under heavy load
(1 GB cvs tree, nfs homes etc.) My question is whether this 
load can depend on available disk space because I do not
see any suspect processes that can cause such a high load.
Kernel: 2.2.19
Patches: lfs + md + ide
RH6.2 + glibc-2.2.12
Thanks.
