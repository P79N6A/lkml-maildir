I do have CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER enabled, but it seems by board does not
have such piece of hardware:
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ dmesg | grep -i "time\|tick\|apic"
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:11.5 to 64
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ 
[Strange, I should see some messages about apic, no?]
