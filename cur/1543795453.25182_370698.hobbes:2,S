Hum... This sizeof(struct file) increase seems quite large...
Have you ever considered to change struct file so that file_ra_state is not 
embedded, but dynamically allocated (or other strategy) for regular files ?
I mean, sockets, pipes cannot readahead... And some machines use far more 
sockets than regular files.
I wrote such a patch in the past I could resend...
