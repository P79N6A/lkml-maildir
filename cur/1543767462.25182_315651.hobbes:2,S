I think what Andi meant was that instead of copying code from x86-64 
to i386 and making x86-64 link to this i386 copy, you can leave the 
code in x86-64 and link it from i386 part of the tree. 
Doing it either way should be OK with this mce code. But I feel, 
despite of the patch size, it is better to keep all the shared 
code in i386 tree and link it from x86-64. Otherwise, it may become 
kind of messy in future, with various links between i386 and x86-64.
Andi/Andrew: What do you suggest here?
Thanks,
Venki
