They are provided by _one_ kernel, not necessarily the running kernel.
That doesn't make them any less a kernel header.
So if some userspace program depends on header <linux/x.h> to get the
interface definition for feature x, and you remove <linux/x.h> from
the current kernel, it _will_ break the userspace program some time
later, when glibc picks up the new kernel.
Having said that that, <asm/segment.h> may or may not be validly
exported to userspace.
