I forgot to add another condition in my semantic patch. 
I was looking only for xxx->priv = yyy; 
with this rule:
@ danger @
struct net_device *dev;
expression E;
@@
 dev->priv = E
whereas sometimes it's written xxx.priv = yyy; 
as in ibm_emac_mal ( mal->poll_dev.priv = mal; )
By adding the following rule in my semantic patch I correctly
_dont_ modify anything under drivers/net/ibm_emac
@ danger @
struct net_device dev;
expression E;
@@
 dev.priv = E
It's also the case for  drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c.
