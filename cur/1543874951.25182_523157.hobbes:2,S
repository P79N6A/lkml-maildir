If it's hitting the bug_on that I put in sched.c which you say it is then it 
is most certainly my fault. It implies a task has been queued without a 
corresponding bit being anywhere in the priority bitmaps. Somehow you only 
seem to be hitting it on big(ger) smp which is why I haven't seen it. It 
implies some complication occuring at sched or idle init/fork off these 
accounting not working. If I could reproduce it on qemu I'd step through the 
kernel init checking where each task is being queued and see if the bitmaps 
are being set. This is obviously time consuming and laborious so I don't 
expect you to do it. 
The next best thing is if you can send me the config of one of the machines 
that's oopsing I can try that on qemu but qemu is only good at debugging 
i386. If any of the machines that were oopsing were i386 that would be very 
helpful, otherwise x86_64 is the next best. Then I need to make a creative 
debugging patch for you to try which checks every queued/dequeued task and 
dumps all that information. I don't have that patch just yet so I need to 
find enough accumulated short stints at the pc to do that (still hurts a lot 
and worsens my condition).
Thanks!
