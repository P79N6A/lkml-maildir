I take it that Pyxis is a type of Alpha box?
What virt_to_bus() does is to convert the virtual address to an
address as seen from the PCI bus. The way I read the above code it
means that memory in the Pyxis box as seen from the PCI bus will
always be above the 1GB limit. In this case it simply means that you
are out of luck, yet another broken PCI device, and the driver should
simply print a warning and exit, without panicing the box.
Time to moan at the people who did the ESS Solo1 and ask them to
replace the card with one that is PCI 2.x compliant ;-)
