rdtscp doesn't solve anything extra which can't already be solved with 
existing vgetcpu (based on lsl) and rdtsc.  which have the advantage of 
working on all x86, not just the (currently) rare revF opteron.
lsl-based vgetcpu is relatively slow (because it is a protected 
instruction with lots of microcode) -- but there are other options which 
continue to work on all x86 (see <
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/13/401>
).

even with rdtscp you have to deal with the definite possibility of being 
scheduled away in the middle of the computation.  arguably you need to 
deal with the possibility of being scheduled away *and* back again to the 
same cpu (so testing cpu# at top and bottom of a loop isn't sufficient).
suleiman proposed a per-cpu scheduling event number to deal with that... 
not sure what folks think of that idea.
