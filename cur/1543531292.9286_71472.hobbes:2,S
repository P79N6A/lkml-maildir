Does the standard say something about paging? (I don't know, but i think no)
Paging is transparent, until you *time* what you're doing. Then you'll
see what the difference is between RAM and disk access time.
Isn't malloc() supposed to return "memory"? What is this thing that under
some some (uncontrollable, unpredictable) conditions this "memory" behave
just like disk? What does the C standard say about my process being
put to sleep in the middle of a for(;;); ?  Or being interrupted 
by ^C (while doing no terminal I/O: I've seen too many DOS programmers
implement this interrupt "feature" by having a program read stdin
- as soon as they discovered the way to do a nonblocking reads - in its
core loop, just to allow themselves stop runaway programs).
And who's this "root" who keeps killing my wonderful memory-hog fork-bomb
C exercise (a perfectly legal "C" program, it compiles just fine):
the Standard says nothing about fascist sysadms B-)

Put it another way: what did wrong my C program that received a nasty
SIGTERM (and as soon as I learned how to catch it, they sent me SIGKILL
- still studing they way to catch it...)? Of course, root just decided
it was shutdown time... 
At shutdown time, program gets SIGTERMed and SIGKILLed, no matter if
the follow the C Standard or not. At OOS time, they get SIGKILLed.
What the C Standard has to do with that?
malloc() "allocates" memory only on its own opaque pool. It has no
OS meaning. On systems with no protected memory (yes, you compile C
programs on them) you can access every address you like. No need to
malloc. You may write you own heap management routine. libc provides one.
On system with memory protection, you can still write your own 
heap management routine, which uses whatever system call to do its jobs.
malloc is a "standard" way to manage a heap.  Just like the standard
buffered I/O functions. They are a way to use buffered I/O. Those I/O
buffers are all a user-land thing.  On Linux, even write(2) is "buffered".
What malloc() does is to give you an address which is "valid" for a
following free(), and which is not overlapping with following malloc()s.
It's a general purpose "memory" allocator which is supposed to be:
1) bug - free;
2) efficient (with an average use).
But here "memory" is an abstraction. Not real RAM. Nor paged RAM+swap.
How this abstraction is mapped to system resources its up to the kernel.
It may give you real RAM. Or set the MMU up with permissions and handle
page faults. 
Whether *a = 0; will cause an error or not it's all a OS matter, not a C
language issue. No matter what the value of "a" is. Even NULL is an 
abstraction. It may be implemented being not zero (but in C i think
that NULL == 0 is always true no matter its real value, so that
if (node->next) {...} works).
What malloc() returns is a valid "C" address, and a valid OS virtual
address. When you access it, if the kernel cannot map it to a valid
object, because of resource shortage, you will get an OS "error", which
is not a "C" error. The kernel is allowed to post you a signal whenever
it thinks it should to. The C standard has nothing to say about it.

You're missing that an overcommitting MM system is more advanced than
a nonovercommitting one. The kernel "keeps track of memory" the right way.
