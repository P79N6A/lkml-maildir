Well, at least one of the problem I caught with my ppc32 implementation
of DEBUG_PAGEALLOC yes. PowerPC dma_alloc_coherent, on machines with
cache consistent PCI DMA, would use get_order to allocate pages and then
memset over the size passed in. The ide-pmac driver, among others, would
trigger that bug by asking for 0x1020 bytes while get_order only
returned 0. (I should look into making the ide-pmac driver allocate <=
4K but that's a different matter).
I think it fixed David Woodhouse random crashes too.

Yup, the above. Calls to dma_alloc_consistent with a constant size that
is not a multiple of the page size and larger than one page. (Our
dma_alloc_consistent implementation on 32 bits is inline).
