	No, it's not. I write high-performance servers and my main enemy is 
burstiness. One significant cause of burstiness is code faulting in. This is 
especially true because many of my servers support adding code to them 
through user-supplies shared object files.

	I'm not talking about deliberate attempts at harming the server. These won't 
work over and over because the code will fault in once and be in. I'm talking 
about smooth performance in the face of unpredictable loads, and that means 
not stalling on every page fault.
