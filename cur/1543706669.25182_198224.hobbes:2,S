Well, yes, I suppose we could make those into "Unexpected ACK" and
"Unexpected NAK" messages. Still it's rather weird they're appearing on
the 430TX machine, since I've never seen them before on any of my test
machines (some of which operate with USB keyboard/mouse only).
Meelis, can you please enable DEBUG in i8042.c, so that I can check
where these unexpected NAKs come from?
