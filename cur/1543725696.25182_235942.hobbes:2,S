Sure, but does it mean "It's buggy and may be killed at any time.  And BTW 
don't compile it in if you don't know what you're doing, because it may kill 
your dog and noone will help you - you have been warned"?
The idea is essentially not about saying that something is unmaintained, but 
about marking chunks of code slated for removal in a manner that's clearly 
visible to users.
