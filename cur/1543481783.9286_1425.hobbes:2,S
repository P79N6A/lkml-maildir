Subject: SMC EtherPower II, System Reboot in 100MBps FULL_DUPLEX, 2.2.0-pre6

I have an SMC EtherPower II PCI Ethernet Card, I compiled the driver as a
module, which works out as epic100.o... The module loads, and network
operations work to some extent. However when doing something that is fairly
constant and high-speed, (ie: scp, or ftp) via the LAN at 100MBps the entire
machine simply reboot, not a warning, OOPS, or log... After this the card
just keeps blinking. Powering down the machine is the only way to reset the
card into normal operation, the machine resetting does not fix it. Below I
have included some system stats that I though could be important, but I have a
feeling this is a hardware bug in which a workaround needs to be written.
Linux version 2.2.0-pre6 (root@kor.tkg) (gcc version egcs-2.91.60 19981201
(egcs-1.1.1 release)) #5 Sat Jan 9 15:35:11 EST 1999
I will right now compile and try 2.2.0-pre9 however I didnt see any changes
other then an APM fix that could help this, and that wouldnt explain the cards
need to power down to operate again. I will also try compiling it as a
non-module but again, I doubt that is the problem... I hope someone else here
can run a similar test, it may be important that the card is in 100MBps
FULL_DUPLEX mode.
