Thanks.  It looks to be very similar to the ext2 changes.
We also need to not go BUG() if ->prepare_write returns
an error.  It's pretty unlikely - it'd need an IO error
against an indirect which had already been successfully
read and then evicted (I think).  But proper recovery there
would be better.
