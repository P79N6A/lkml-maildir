same problem observed here on same motherboard. The hard disk is a WDC AC23200L
configured as hda. I have tested several ide/kernel combinations and all I can
say is that 2.2.18 and 2.2.19 behave the same, but it worked till
ide.2.2.18.1221 included, and the bug appeared since ide.2.2.18.02122001.
I tried with and without vojtech's via patches (3.2, 4.2 and 4.3), but this
didn't change anything (to be honest, some combinations were obviously not made
to live together, and I had so many problems fitting all patches in one kernel
that it sometimes even didn't boot).
I can also say that this problem didn't show up on other chipsets (ali and
intel) with the same kernel+ide patch.
finally, I made my kernel with ide.2.2.18.1221 and all seems to be OK (one week
now). The diffs between the 2 versions were too important and I have not
investigated further into this, but I'm ready to make some tests if needed.
Regards,
Willy
PS: BTW Andre, could you please name your patches ide-2.2.19-YYYYMMDD so that a
    directory listing show the chronological order ?
