Well, if ->resume() returns an error, the driver already knows there's a
problem and it can act upon that, at least in principle.
However, the PM core probably shouldn't try to resume the children of a failing
device.  Also, if ->resume_noirq() fails, it probably is not a good idea to
call ->resume() and ->complete() for the same device and for it's children.
