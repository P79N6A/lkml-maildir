Subject: d_entry delete ( d_delete ) in d_cache.c on linux 2.6.15 and beyond

Hello,
I notice that on versions 2.6.15 and later, the function
     void d_delete(struct dentry * dentry)
Implements a mechanism for notifying the deletion of the d_entry.
The implementation assumes that the d_entry has a non-null d_inode pointer
and that seems to be terribly wrong. In other words, how can a
"negative d_entry"
be deleted? Implementation of rename may use dummy dentries (that have d_inode
set to NULL) and that is a problem as well.
Please CC me if you have any comments/feedback on this subject.
Thanks!

PS. For more specific details on the code I'm referring to, see below:
File .../fs/dcache.c
void d_delete(struct dentry * dentry)
{
	int isdir = 0;
...
	spin_lock(&dcache_lock);
	spin_lock(&dentry->d_lock);
	isdir = S_ISDIR(dentry->d_inode->i_mode);   <======= MUST CHECK d_inode!!!!
	if (atomic_read(&dentry->d_count) == 1) {
...
}
