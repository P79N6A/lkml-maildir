Much better now. Configuration, dmesg at boot, etc are at 
http://www.dea.icai.upco.es/romano/linux/config-2.6.12-rc1-rg/
I booted the 2.6.12-rc1 kernel above (with the alps resume fix) with the 
options: console=ttyS0,115200n8 init=/bin/bash
The full log of the session, if it's interesting to someone, is here: 
http://www.dea.icai.upco.es/romano/linux/swsusp/2612rc1-bash.s3.log
The interesting part is here. At suspend I have: 
bash-2.05b# echo -n 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep
[4294743.859000] Stopping tasks: ===|
and the laptop goes off with suspend light blinking. Ok. After a 20 sec, I
hit the power button and: 
[4294759.817000]  evevent-0286: *** Error: No installed handler for fixed
event
[00000002]
[4294759.827000] Restarting tasks... done
bash-2.05b#
I have the prompt back! But the HDD light is fixed on... I tried lsmod: 
bash-2.05b# lsmod
Dead. After a bit it says: 
[4294828.522000] hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
[4294838.522000] hda: DMA timeout error
[4294838.526000] hda: dma timeout error: status=0x58 { DriveReady
SeekComplete DataRequest }
[4294838.536000]
[4294838.538000] ide: failed opcode was: unknown
[4294838.546000] hda: task_in_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete
DataRequest Error }
[4294838.556000] hda: task_in_intr: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
[4294838.564000] ide: failed opcode was: unknown
this (with error 0x59 and 0x04) is repeated 3 more times, then: 
[4294838.699000] ide0: reset: success
but nothing change, and after a bit: 
[4294858.708000] hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
[4294868.708000] hda: DMA timeout error
[4294868.712000] hda: dma timeout error: status=0x58 { DriveReady
SeekComplete DataRequest }
[4294868.722000]
[4294868.724000] ide: failed opcode was: unknown
[4294868.729000] hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete
DataRequest }
[4294868.738000]
[4294868.740000] ide: failed opcode was: unknown
[4294868.746000] hda: drive not ready for command
(3 more times) 
[4294868.862000] ide0: reset: success
[4294888.879000] hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
...and continuing forever (with error 0x58 as before). In the full log there
is a sysrq-m and sysrq-t result, but I do not think it's very important
here. 
When I decided to stop I hit sysrq-b and: 
[4294911.707000] SysRq : Resetting 
The bios (with the "sony" splash) restarted but locked hard, and to resume I
had to do the hard poweroff (5 seconds power button down). 
Well. I hope this helps someone :-). I will stay with S4 for now.
