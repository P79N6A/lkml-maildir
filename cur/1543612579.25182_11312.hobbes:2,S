I did try R5 in htree, and at least a dozen other hashes.  R5 was the worst 
of the bunch, in terms of uniformity of distribution, and caused a measurable 
slowdown in Htree performance.  (Not an order of magnitude, mind you, 
something closer to 15%.)
An alternative way of looking at this is, rather than R5 causing an order of 
magnitude improvement for certain cases, something else is causing an order 
of magnitude slowdown for common cases.  I'd suggest attempting to root that 
out.
