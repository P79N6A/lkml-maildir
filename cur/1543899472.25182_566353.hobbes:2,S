I'm not proposing that, sorry.  I'm not a filesystem expert, so don't think
I can propose a working solution here, right now.  Still, maybe something
like in fork.c, line 1409-1411 might work (I know that it won't solve the
"other tasks may be waiting on VFS mutexes" issue, but at least it may
decrease the probability of freezer failure).

Please have a look at the documentation update at the bottom of this patch:
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.22-rc7/patches/15-freezer-make-kernel-threads-nonfreezable-by-default.patch
It says what the freezer is for in the first place. :-)

Well, I can agree as far as FUSE is concerned.  Still, imagine that you have
an NFS share mounted, which is unavailable at the moment and one of the
tasks waits for an I/O on it to complete (it might hold some locks needed
for suspending, but say it doesn't).  Then you suspend, take the box somewhere
else and attach to a different network with a different NFS server.  Now, you
resume and you have a mess to recover from.  Yes, it _should_ be recoverable,
but refusing to suspend in such a case is not okerkill, IMHO.

See above. :-)

Actually, we want things to get scheduled, because we need some of them to
save the image (to make things more difficult, we don't know what will be
needed to save the image in advance ;-)).
