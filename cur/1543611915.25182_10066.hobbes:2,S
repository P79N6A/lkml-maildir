I doubt ALSA will get into 2.4 since its maintenance only, but i'm not the
final authority on this ;) Also when ALSA starts getting incorporated
into the kernel, they will use their more upto date tree, i would
presume, so they wouldn't start at 0.5. But as everyone else says, i'm
sure we'll be backporting fixes and perhaps even additional card support
into 2.4-OSS as they appear.
