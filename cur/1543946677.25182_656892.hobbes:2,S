I would expect that these various functions are implemented in a modular
fashion, thus also giving some flexibility regarding the file layout of
the source code.

I agree that it makes a lot of sense to group all of these drivers into
a common menu.  The menu layout doesn't have to be entirely the same as
the source code files layout (it never is the same in the last
consequence anyway), but it would of course help to keep config menu
layout and source files layout mostly aligned.
