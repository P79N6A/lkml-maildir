Yes. It is ugly to kick init to reap the kernel thread. I was going to
do this change a long ago, but I don't have time to do even a minimal
testing now.
reparent_to_init() expects that thread_group_empty() == true anyway,
we can set ->exit_signal = -1 and make this thread invisible to init.
Roland, what do you think?
