One can do find+ recode magic now
The question is :
- can this be automated ?
- how can one recognise and unconverted fs ?
- how can on guess the encodings(s) that have been used before on such
an fs ?
You're assuming the situation is merely a iso8859-1 to utf-8 migration.
Far from it. The core problem is everyone damn wrote what it pleased him
without considering future readers.
