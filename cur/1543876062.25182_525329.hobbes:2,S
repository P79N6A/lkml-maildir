You have thre problems here, and none of them are in the kernel :)
First the hardsware is broken when it can't deal with concurrent requests,
I'd try to get a refund for it.  Second wodim should never ever use
/dev/sg if the sr node is available.  And third HAL should stop poking
devices all the time.  Then again hald is a totally lost cause and
I can only recommend to uninstall it ASAP.
