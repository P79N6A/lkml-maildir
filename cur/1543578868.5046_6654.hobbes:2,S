I have used IBM drives with Intel PIIX, Promise ATA100 and various VIA
chipsets on 2.4.  They have been extremely fast and reliable.  There were
some reports with troubles with IBM disks and a specific chipset, but it
may just as well be the chipset.  Hard to prove without an ATA analyzer
and a full spec...
