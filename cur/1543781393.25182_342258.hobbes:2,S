I do, in fact, which is the reason I submitted these patches in the
first place.  :-)
The WIS GO7007, which is the MPEG1/2/4 video encoder used in the Plextor
ConvertX, has an on-board i2c interface that supports nothing but 8-bit
and 16-bit register reads and writes.  Worse, it does not correctly
report i2c errors.  Even if it did support probing, though, I wouldn't
want to use it because the i2c adapter generally lives on the other end
of a USB and requires a minimum of 15 USB round trips per i2c
transaction, so probing 124 i2c addresses would take a while.

Yeah, I copied those lines from other parts of i2c-core.c.  But I'll fix
them.

I could, I guess.  Is there a reason i2c_probe_address is limited to
7-bit addresses?  Clients with 10-bit addresses (I've never seen one,
but I guess they exist?) should be able to be instantiated though the
known-device list.
I think the way to go about this would be to rework and resubmit the
first 3 patches once we decide how to handle the no-probe adapter flag,
and later I will send a separate patch set for review with the
known-device list implementation.
Thank you for all your help!  -Nathan
