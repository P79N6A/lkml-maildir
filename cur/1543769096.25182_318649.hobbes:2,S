You've only pointed out two timesources that could want this (ITC and
TSC), so I think its reasonable to do your jitter handling in the
timesource driver. If there are other arches that have non hardware
synced per-cpu counters, then it would be something to consider.

I disagree. I already explained how this can be done via the
arch_update_vsyscall_gtod() interface by special casing for this
specific well known time source.

If more timesources need that functionality, then I'll be happy to.
Until then it should stay in the ia64 specific itc driver and fastcall
code.
