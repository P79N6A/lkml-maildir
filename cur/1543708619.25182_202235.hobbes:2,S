There were no changes between 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 that could affect reiser4
performance, so it is not clear why numbers are so different. Probably
results should be averaged over several runs. Also can you run test with
http://www.namesys.com/snapshots/2004.02.25/extra/e_05-proc-sleep.patch
applied? To use it turn CONFIG_PROC_SLEEP on (depends on
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER), and do "cat /proc/sleep" before and after test
run.
