So you get a total hang? I guess there's a bug somewhere...

That's not the problem here if you get a total hang. This heuristic should
only reduce the amount of dirty memory, it should never grind a task 
to a total hang, until some other task writes to the filesystem.
The sysrq shows the task sleeping in blk_congestion_wait.

You should leave it to 0 until I find the buglet that hangs the system.
I'll have a look.
One other thing to change is to call balance_dirty only when the dirty
bit is toggled (so overwrites of dirty cache are not accounted, since
they generate no additional I/O on disk).
Thanks.
