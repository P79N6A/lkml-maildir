I don't think it's a food idea.  Consider a program that deliberately
creates an executable anon memory, copies the binary there, jumps there
and unmaps the original.   In the current tree you'll get nothing
pinning the binary; with your patch it will remained busy.
It's not a common situation, of course, but there are legitimate uses
for such technics...
