If your theory is correct then it should be able to demonstrate this
problem without any special hardware at all: pin some user memory, then
generate memory pressure then check the contents of those pinned pages.
But if, for the DMA transfer, you're using the array of page*'s which were
originally obtained from get_user_pages() then it's rather hard to see how
the kernel could alter the page's contents.
Then again, if mlock() fixes it then something's up.  Very odd.
