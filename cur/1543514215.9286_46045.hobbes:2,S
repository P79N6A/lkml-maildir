So why was it there? Old crud nobody has bothered removing?
mmap() does work on fat files, right?

I was reluctant to posting a proposed fix for fat, but I didn't find
an official maintainer for fat in MAINTAINERS, and 2.3.23 has been out
for a while now.
As for missing "page_cache_entry", I just did the obvious to
fix the compiler's type errors. It's just too bad that sometimes
changed semantics isn't made visible as changed types. IMNSHO,
MAP_NR() shouldn't work on "struct page*" values.
Anyway, thanks for posting a real fix.
