Yes!

Hmm, that board has only 512KB ROM. I can fit a minimal Linux kernel
and root-FS in that, but only if it's compressed. ROM, in my experience,
is more expensive than RAM, so it often makes sense to save ROM space
even at the expense of using a little more RAM.
But I'm curious: is there a simple procedure to set up a linux Kernel
to execute from ROM ?
