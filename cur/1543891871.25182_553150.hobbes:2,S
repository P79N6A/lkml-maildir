Done in a very poor manner.

I do agree. I have looked over the zlib code and it is very involved - I, 
personally, would not like to have to maintain it if I couldn't easily diff 
it against userspace.

I've looked back over the entire spread of the messages, both from before I 
wrote that quick&dirty benchmark and after. Maintainability is a good thing 
to aim for, however the style used to achieve the complete cross-platform 
mobility could be handled a lot cleaner - give me a few days to really study 
the LZO code and I'll see if I can't reach a middle-ground - code that is 
easy to maintain (and diff against userspace) as well as being stripped to 
its core and very cleanly implemented.
I can't promise results, but I figure I'm at fault for really starting this 
current spate of flames so I should at least take responsibility and do 
something to try and put them out. What I can say, at this point, is that a 
lot of my changes will be in making the code comply to kernel-style in a 
manner *similar* to how Nitin has done it - collapse redundant code together, 
replace open-coded blocks with calls to library functions, etc...

Hindsight is sometimes too perfect. I should have returned to the early posts 
for clarity before making a lot of the comments I did. It shames me to admit 
that I've made such a nasty mistake and made myself seem like nothing more 
than a common troll.
Apologetically,
