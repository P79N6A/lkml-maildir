You are wrong, indeed. The dentries in the dcache are connected to the dcache 
through their parent dentry pointers, which means that the parent dentries 
are always in memory, too. No I/O is involved for walking up dentry trees.
(Caveat: nfsd does allow disconnected dentries. It does not make sense to try 
confining an in-kernel daemon though, an no user process can ever access a 
dentry before it gets connected (lookup does that), so this difference is 
irrelevant here.)
