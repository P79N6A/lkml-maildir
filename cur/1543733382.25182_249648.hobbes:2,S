Some examples of merging are turning two independent radeon
personality modules into a single one. Another thing I need to do is
to extract the printk support from the core fb module and put it
somewhere I can get to it from DRM. We can't have two cores trying to
attach to the same device and then doing takeover_console().
Mode setting will be a lot of new code since Alan's proposed design
doesn't match any of the existing solutions. I will try to reuse
snippets where I can.
