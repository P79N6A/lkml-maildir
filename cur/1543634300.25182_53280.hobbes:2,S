it seems that some older kernels do the same...
I have discovered recently I have the same problem with a HP Netserver LH
3000 wich works fine in any other case :
uname-a
Linux databaseserver 2.4.10 #1 Tue Nov 13 17:28:13 CET 2001 i686 unknown
excerpt of dmesg :

eth0: OEM i82557/i82558 10/100 Ethernet, 00:30:6E:00:1A:49, IRQ 18.
  Receiver lock-up bug exists -- enabling work-around.
  Board assembly 506477-150, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
  General self-test: passed.
  Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
  Internal registers self-test: passed.
  ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x04f4518b).
  Receiver lock-up workaround activated.
on a Slackware 8.0 running postgreSQL.
When i mount a SMB share and copy a large file to an NT Server (postgres
database files  : 2-3 GBytes) all network connections are closed and a
reboot is needed.
It seems also that this problem is related
This server has been in production state for almost 1 year and is very
stable as long as you don't transfer large files to a network mount point.
Hope this helps
