Hi all,
I was wondering how well the AOpen AK33 and Linux 2.2.18/19 play
together? I saw a really good deal recently but remember reading
some issues with the KT133 chipset not too long ago. The archives
weren't all that specific. The issues that I could identify
were:
1) Mouse cursor jumping?
2) Clock loosing time (but correctable with NTP).
3) Disk corruption (2.2.x or 2.4.x?)
Thanks in advance...
