Now I have another symtom: during the _second_ suspend the suspending of
USB controllers fails with messages like this:
usb_hcd_pci_suspend(): ehci_pci_suspend+0x0/0xab [ehci_hcd]() returns -22
pci_device_suspend(): usb_hcd_pci_suspend+0x0/0x16d [usbcore]() returns -22
suspend_device(): pci_device_suspend+0x0/0x4b() returns -22
Could not suspend device 0000:00:13.2: error -22
Could you please tell me which patches might have caused this, in your opinion?
Rafael
