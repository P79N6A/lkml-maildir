Yes, multiple disks striped in RAID-0, 4 x DiamondMax 10 300GB, ext2 fs.
On a cheapish Dell OptiPlex GX620 that uses Intel 945G. 1.6Gbit/s write
to disk while reading PCI(-X) goes just fine, though of course gets
slower near disk ends.
Streaming filesystems, yes, that's what I'd like to evaluate next vs
ext2 once the Samsung SP2504C disks with Streaming Feature Set support
arrive.

Ok, probably yes, this is also something to be done outside of kernel.
However this guy over here
 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0411.3/0338.html
has written speedcontrol.c for SET STREAMING (linked pdf there, page
457), which is somewhat similar to the commands in the Streaming feature
set. One quote: "In my opinion it would make sence to also enhance the
kernel function cdrom_select_speed (linux/drivers/ide/ide-cd.c), so that
this function works also for "newer" DVD-drives." etc
But OTOH also Tejun's points about that this Streaming set should be
implemented in userland are quite valid. And I don't know where exactly
such functionality could be added to the kernel i.e. where I would propose
such a feature to be added; it was a thought there might be some suitable
place and people here would know where to add ;-))
But actually after googling more, XFS file system seems to have something
like Streaming feature set support, or at least provisions for adding such
commands, as it has a guaranteed-rate I/O feature
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS#Guaranteed_rate_I.2FO
So I guess XFS code is the better place to start thinking about Streaming
feature set implementation.
Many thanks for your input! :-))
