I note that pci_enable_device() needs to be executed __before__
the IRQ is obtained on 2.6.10, otherwise you get the wrong IRQ
(IRQ10 on this system)B.
This doesn't seem to be correct since the IRQ connection was set
by the BIOS and certainly shouldn't be changed. On this system,
interrupts that were not shared on 2.4.n and early 2.6.n end
up being shared... See IRQ18 below.
