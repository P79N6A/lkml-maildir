I *think* the ranges were typically aligned to 4 GB, although with 8 GB
in a single node, I don't remember what the mapping layout looked like.
Which made everything but node 0 into HIGHMEM.
With the "flat" addressing mode that Martin has been using (the
dummied down for NT version) everything is squished together.  That
makes it a bit harder to do node local data structures, although he
may have enough data from the MPS table to split memory appropriately.
