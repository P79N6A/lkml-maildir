It's quite possible (about a 3% chance) that the PID of the
hog (that we _want_ to get killed) is in the <1000 range...
Also, "simply reverse-ordering chronologically" doesn't work
if it means killing two dozen innocent processes before we
get to the memory hog.
Killing processes when we're out of memory is _bad_ (but
unavoidable) so we'd better make sure that we kill the hog
and keep all other processes alive...

Rik
