Wrong. Since when does usage constitute "tainted" knowledge?
You get tainted knowledge by looking at source code, not by usage.
By the same token, users of MS Office, which is even more restrictively
licensed than BK (no free use whatsoever, remember?), couldn't work on
OpenOffice.org.
The license says that, if you work on a competing system, you cannot use
BK. It cannot prevent somebody who has used BK sometime in the past, from
writing an SCM sometime in the future, since the license governs only your
use of BK, but not whatever else you're doing. It's a license for
BitKeeper and not for anybody's brain, after all.
