That's conceptually self-evident once you are aware of the NTFS concepts I 
have outlined in my post to lkml entitled: NTFS primer - was: Re: NTFS-like 
streams? (Al, I cc-ed that particular post to you).
 From there it follows that you do the following:
C:\> echo strange_data_here > \:my_stream_name
You can then do
C:\> dir \
and you will see that your data / streamname have disappeared somewhere but 
you get the data back when you do:
C:\> cat \:my_stream_name
That's all. (-:

Unfortunately it was incorrect (if only by being incomplete and without 
explanations). - Hardlinks are implemented as I described in above 
mentioned post.
