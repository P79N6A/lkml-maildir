Hi All,
2.6.12, GCC 3.4.4 on Slackware 10 base
New 2.6.12 build hangs at initialising udev dynamic device directory on boot.  
I used make oldconfig from 2.6.11.12, and all the new changes I selected N, 
all bar nvidia FB support (I built several times, as I have a GeForce4 card, 
so suspected the nvidia FB support at first and turned off).
2.6.11.12 works perfect.
I have just spent an hour or so investigating, but I am none the wiser.
Ideas what could be causing this?
Nick
