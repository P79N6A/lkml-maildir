Hi,
I am interested in using linux driver for 3com ADSL PCI Modem Card. 3Com
does not have the linux driver for it(according to thier websites and as far
as i have searched). I wish to write the driver for it (ofcourse under GPL).
Any pointers where i could find tech specification for it?
Thanks & Cheers,
Venkatesh
