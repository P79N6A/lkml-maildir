Incidentally, an argument can be made that using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL  
actually renders your code incompatible with the GPL, insofar as it  
violates the "additional restriction" clause. Which doesn't matter as long  
as it's *only* your code (author can always do different things), but  
*does* matter if you add *other* people's GPL code (such as the rest of  
the kernel), because it's *their* GPL that you're breaking ...
