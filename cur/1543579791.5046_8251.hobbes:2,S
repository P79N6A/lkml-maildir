I'm looking at your code, in the function
vlan_dev_set_multicast_list() for the 2.4 tree, you enable promiscuity and
reception of all multicast packets. Is this necessary for all cards? 
This looks pretty close to what I was looking for, thanks for the
pointer. Do the multicast functions have enough usefulness for things
other than VLAN to be split out separately?
