>I appreciate that but per-function tracing is overkill.
I agree that 100% function coverage is overkill.
However, 100% is preferable to 0%.
The most desirable middle-ground will take some work
on the part of the folks that actually use the tracing.

Everybody agreees with you about the return_VALUE syntax.
The other irritating thing about this instrumentation is
that the function trace header looks like a call, but
is actually a declaration -- so sometimes DEBUG builds
break when executable code is put before it.  The fortunate
thing is that a relatively small group of people make
changes to the ACPI sub-system and this is one of the
things they learn about quickly:-)
If kprobes can give us the same functionality,
I'll be delighted if somebody can show me how.

I share your concern about source code style.
Note that as I mentioned, we've got some changes in the pipeline
to clean up drivers/acpi/*.c already.
Changing this in the upstream interpreter in drivers/acpi/*/
will be harder and will take longer.
