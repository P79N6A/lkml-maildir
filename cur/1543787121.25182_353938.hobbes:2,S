I've seen the thread mostly following the hardware line. I'd like to
enquire down the kernel path because I've seen occasional, impossible to
reproduce problems too.
Can I ask first a few questions:
1) Are you using vanilla kernels, or do you have other patches applied?
2) Are you using ext3 only?
3) Is the corruption only ever in memory, or seen on disk too?
4) Is the corruption only in one filesystem or spread across several (if
applicable)? (ie in / but not /home or others?)
Regards,
Nigel
