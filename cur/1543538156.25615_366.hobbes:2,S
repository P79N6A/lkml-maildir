ISO C mandates void * being bit identical to char *.  Void * in fact started
out in life as a proposal for two concepts, one of which was the general
pointer type that could point to anything (IIRC including functions), and the
other for the return type of malloc and friends, which says that the pointer is
guaranteed to be sufficiently aligned to hold any data type.  Along the way,
the requirement that the generic pointer hold function addresses was dropped,
and the explicit type for the aligned pointer was dropped.
