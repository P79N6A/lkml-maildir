He's emphasising the difference between "null pointer constant"  and "null
pointer", however NULL is defined as "an implementation-defined null
pointer constant", so any subtle issues regarding 0 apply equally well to
NULL.
Someone pointed out that there can be a difference between 0 and NULL when
passing the value to a function lacking a prototype. There's no guarantee
that the null pointers of different types have the same representation, so
passing NULL into such a function without an explicit cast would also be
incorrect.
