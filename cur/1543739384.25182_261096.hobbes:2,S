To clarify - "ps -eLf" does traverse /proc/pid/task/tid/ , so yes, there are
tools which are task-aware. But in this case, I meant that it does not
matter as the output of /proc/pid/task/tid/stat is unchanged by my patch.
I more exactly meant that to my knowledge, no procps tools add up all the
tasks in /ptoc/pid/task/tid and present them as one process.
Sorry for the confusion.
