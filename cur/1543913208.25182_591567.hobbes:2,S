Misunderstood you, with this patch there will be the same behavior,
that's the intention. There might be slightly differences in ordering
rules for read/write cycles. IO config cycles are serialized while
ordering rules for MMIO config cycles may result in unexpected
behavior for PCI devices on the bus.
