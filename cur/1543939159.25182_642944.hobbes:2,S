I may need them then.  I updated to your latest available git tree
and applied the patchset I sent and I got this build error:
kernel/module.c:345: error: expected identifier or '(' before 'char'
kernel/module.c:345: error: expected ')' before numeric constant
With the fixup patch, all my test configs (and your config) build cleanly.
The hang though, I'm getting as well and am debugging it now (alibi
slowly since it's happening so early.  Too bad grub doesn't have kdb
in it... ;-)
Thanks,
Mike
