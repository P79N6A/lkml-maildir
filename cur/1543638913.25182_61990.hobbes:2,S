Dear Customer,
Thank you for contacting Blue Dolphin Group.
The Customer Customer Care Department here at Blue Dolphin is working very
hard to answer all of our subscriber's inquiries.  To expedite this
process, we've answered some commonly asked questions below.  If your
questions are not addressed here, please be patient, we'll be getting back
to you promptly.
MAGAZINE CANCELLATIONS: We will process your magazine cancellations within
one week. If you are waiting for a refund you should see that reflected on
your credit card account in 10-14 days.
GIFTS (including Gift Certificates, Books, Electronics, etc.): These are
prizes. By taking advantage of the Risk-Free trial subscription offer, you
are automatically entered into our Special Prize Drawing. The drawings take
place monthly and you will be notified by mail if your entry is selected as
a winner.
HAVEN'T RECEIVED MAGAZINE YET: Standard industry lead time for delivery of
the first issue is 8 weeks, depending on the date an order is placed and
the publication's frequency. If the magazine is only published 6 times/year
it will take longer than 8 weeks to receive your first issue.
