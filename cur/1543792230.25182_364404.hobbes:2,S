Minor nit, udev does not use "." in its version numbers :)

I see that 073 is in unstable, which fixed a lot of problems with 071,
072 and 073 due to Debian configuration issues.  I suggest you try that.

No, stick with the debian packages, due to the wierd packaging and init
issues that Debian has.
I wouldn't recommend using the kernel.org udev packages for anyone on
their own these days, they are what the distros use to package from, and
they know best, due to the different ways the init process works in
different distros.
Good luck,
