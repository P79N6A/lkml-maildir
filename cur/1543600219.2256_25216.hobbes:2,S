Thanks. It just gets in the way. And I'm tired of what I consider
pollution on the 'net. With horror I consider MIME+HTML+vcard. Next I
suppose we'll have M$ "active email" which requires a full virtual
machine in which to execute. <shudder>

That's a policy decision, and I don't want to make that. Also
consider that with the block I/O rewrite planned for 2.5, we'll do
away with these abominable arrays, and thus DEVFS_FL_AUTO_DEVNUM makes
plenty of sense even for block devices. It will in fact be the
preferred way of doing things (at least for devfs).
