I don't know of any problems this causes. The kernel needs to be aware
of the fact that the xss and esp fields of the pt_regs struct may
contain wrong values anyway, as hardware interrupts arriving while the
CPU is in kernel mode would also lead to this condition.
The file include/asm-i386/processor.h contains a comment to that effect
(lines 483-492).
With kernel_execve we can predict this, however, and account for it.
(This may be superfluous, but I don't think it hurts and it might
prevent future errors.)
