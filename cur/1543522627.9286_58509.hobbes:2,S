If you have a scsi-zip, you might want to test a patch I posted to this list
some days ago. It adds a scsi eject-ioctl. It should work with mo/zip, even
tapes (if they support this feature).
You can download the (small) patch at:

After applying the patch, you should try:
$ eject /dev/sd? (whatever id your scsi-zip is).
