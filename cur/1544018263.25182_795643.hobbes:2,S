Thanks, it is simpler.

I think this change is needed.
In the single thread case, we don't need
1) cpu_maps_update_begin(). --> require cpu_add_remove_lock
2) remove workqueue from the list. (we did not inserted it)
It is indeed that there is no bad result occurred when we do these
things for single thread. But I think the destroying should not
do things more than the creating.
Thanks, Lai
