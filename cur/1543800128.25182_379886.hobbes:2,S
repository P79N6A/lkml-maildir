Only for static functions (and in -funit-at-a-time mode).
Anything else would require full IMA over the whole kernel and we aren't
there yet.  So inline hints are useful.  But most of the inline keywords
in the kernel really should be that, hints, because e.g. while it can be
beneficial to inline something on one arch, it may be not beneficial on
another arch, depending on cache sizes, number of general registers
available to the compiler, register preassure, speed of the call/ret
pair, calling convention and many other factors.
