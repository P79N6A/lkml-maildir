Well, since there were no messages about this topic on this list for
few weeks, let me tell you that it hit me again. I have no idea of the
real cause of this, but it is really nasty, so let me state again the
symptoms I know so far:
o Some kind of file system corruption causes "access beyond of device"
  messages in /var/log/messages.
o These messages occur while doing backup on tape (scsi-disk to
  Scsi-tape on same controller) with a simple tar command. Tar exits 
  with error messages such as:
tar: File home/stoll/work/claw/applications/euler/3d/shockbubble/core shrunk by 20127744 bytes, padding with zeros
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
  That core file was about 20MB large, but I also remember it to have
  been some mpeg-files or other.
o Though the error message occurs during local operation, it seems only to 
  affect disks exported by nfs. 
o My box is a PentiumII uni-processor-system, but the effect was also reported on 
  SMP boxes. 
o It happens with both knfsd and userland nfsd, but seems to be less frequent with
  the later (I am now using Universal NFS Server 2.2beta40, on
  selfcompiled a 2.2.13 kernel without any fancy things.)
o Probably not necessary to mention, the effect is completly erratic
  and not reproduceble.
o It does not affect similar build nfs-client-boxes. (Well, they don't
  do backup either..)
o It is absolutely necessary to do a immeadiate forced fsck on that
  disk to avoid a growing loss of data.
Does anybody knows about more details of the problem? Can anybody give
me some hints where to look for some debugging output? 
Yours,
