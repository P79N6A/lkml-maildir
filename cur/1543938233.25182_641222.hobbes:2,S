If you want to distribute that code, the authors of that said code
may be able to challenge you in saying that you are enabling a means to
circumvent a way around the license, and hold you liable. Remember, all it
takes is one country with the laws that will grant this complaint.

Honestly, I don't care which export it is. The thing is that I derived
that code from someone else. I did not look up the original author of the
code to find out which export they would like it to be. I may be able to
argue that since it was under a LGPL and not a GPL license, I may very
well be able to export it that way.
I'm taking the safe way out. By exporting it as EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, I am
safe either way. By exporting it as EXPORT_SYMBOL without first hearing
from the original author (and getting that in writing), or hearing it from
a lawyer, I may be putting myself at risk.
Feel free to creating a version of this code and
s/EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL/EXPORT_SYMBOL/ and distribute it. I wont come after
you for that, but at least I know those that would, will go after you and
not me.
Call me a chicken, I don't care, but I'm just not going to put myself nor
my company I work for, at risk over this issue.
