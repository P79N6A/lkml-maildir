ext3 by default imposes stricter ordering than the other journalling
filesystems in order to improve _data_ consistency (as opposed to just
the guarantee of consistent metadata as most other filesystems do).
if you mount the filesystem with
mount -t ext3 -o data=writeback /dev/foo /mnt/bar
will make it use the same level of guarantee as reiserfs does.
mount -t ext3 -o data=journal /dev/foo /mnt/bar
will do FULL data journalling and will also guarantee data integrety after a
crash...
