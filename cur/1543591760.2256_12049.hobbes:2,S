It could be timer-list corruption.  Someone released some memory
which had a live timer in it.  The memory got recycled and then
the timer list traversal fell over it.
There was a convincing report of this a few weeks back on a
system which didn't have any unusual drivers in it.  It was
inconclusive.  That system was SMP, so it could have been a
timer deletion race.
This bug is so damn hard to track down that it may be worth
putting some special walk-the-timer-lists code inside
kfree()+SLAB_POISON.
