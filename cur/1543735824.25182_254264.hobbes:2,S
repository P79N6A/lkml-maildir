Subject: [Patch] ext3_new_inode() failure case fix

While I am studying ext3_new_inode() failure code paths, I found the
inode->i_nlink is not cleared to 0 in the first failure path. But it is
cleared to 0 in the second failure path(fail to allocate disk quota). I
think it should be cleared in both cases, because later when
generic_drop_inode() is called by iput(), i_nlink is checked to decide
whether to call generic_delete_inode(). Currently it is calling
generic_forget_inode().
Also the reference to the inode bitmap buffer head should be dropped on
the failure path too.
