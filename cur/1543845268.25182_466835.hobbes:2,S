Because a supplementary memory read is added on the critical path with a normal
flag test. The assembly can provide an immediate value without any need of
memory read from the data section.
To change the behavior of the program, I just have to change the immediate value
in the movb instruction.
However, the non-optimized generic version does exactly this : it simply tests a
flag loaded from memory. It can be very useful on embedded systems where the
code is in read-only memory.
