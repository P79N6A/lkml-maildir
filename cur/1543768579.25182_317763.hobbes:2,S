I've just added an RSS feed to kernel.org for tracking the latest kernel 
versions.  This is the same information as what's on the main page, but 
now it can appear in your RSS aggregator.  ;)  
Please set your refresh rate higher than normal; no one needs to check 
every hour for a new kernel.  :)
The direct URL is 
http://kernel.org/kdist/rss.xml
Have fun!
