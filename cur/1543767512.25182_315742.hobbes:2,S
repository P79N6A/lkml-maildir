Correct patch is on ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/UM0-uml-ldscript-RC12-rc3
Short version of the story: current tree plays with a symlink from
vmlinux.lds.S to one of two files, depending on the config.  That doesn't
work well and confused vmlinux.lds.S chunk is actually a demonstration of
breakage - symlink had not been properly cleaned up.
New variant has _fixed_ vmlinux.lds.S - real file with
#include <linux/config.h>
#ifdef CONFIG_LD_SCRIPT_STATIC
#include "uml.lds.S"
#else
#include "dyn.lds.S"
#endif
in it and no symlink magic in makefiles.  Since we feed it through cpp
anyway, we can simply let cpp do all work - including picking the right
script depending on config.
