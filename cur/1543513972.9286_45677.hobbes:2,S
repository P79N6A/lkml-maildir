This is a difference, but not a bug in Solaris. It is documented in
the Solaris man page for chmod(2):
     If a directory is writable and has S_ISVTX (the sticky  bit)
     set,  files  within that directory can be removed or renamed
     only if one or more of the following is true (see  unlink(2)
     and rename(2)):
        o  the user owns the file
        o  the user owns the directory
        o  the file is writable by the user
        o  the user is a privileged user
