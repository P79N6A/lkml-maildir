Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
There were only two minor merge problems.
We are up to 34 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).
Status of my local build tests is at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/.
 We have added arm and m68k
to the architectures built.
