I like the umount logic too, it is very similar to my solution of
down_read_trylock() on the umount semaphore, except that it does not
have the PF_XXXXXXX magic involved.

Comments for the if condition please! It is a bit complex and I had to
read it a few times to understand what the condition achieves

There is a BUG here. What if down_ready_trylock() succeeds and
dentry->d_sb->s_root == NULL? We will be missing an up_read().
