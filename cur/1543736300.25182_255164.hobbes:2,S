Hello!
> And I only want to explain why you don't see ArcNet used much with Linux :-)
I still have some ArcNet hardware at home from the good old times when
I was one of the people maintaining the ArcNet driver, however, I have
only one ISA machine now and all my cards are ISA only.
If anybody would be willing to send me a PCI or PCMCIA ArcNet, I probably
would find time to make the driver work again.
				Have a nice fortnight
