It is not that "RT99 will always have to wait". But yes, the work_struct
queued by RT99 has to wait.

Yes, I see what the patch does,

this itself is wrong, breaks flush_workqueue() semantics

_Which_ waiter? I can't understand at all why work_struct should "inherit"
the priority of the task which queued it. This looks just wrong to me,
even if could implement this safely.
