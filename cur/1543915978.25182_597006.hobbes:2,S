Not all, but critical info, that must exist in human-readable form of

Sure, but a little problem is, that many kernel developers do C (mostly)
and Perl (occasionally), i.e. very few do non-trivial userspace (even
userspace do too much C and Perl sometimes [:

Seriously. When in the Windows there are only messages like:
    "Error (Code:0x00002012)".
In the Linux... well, embedded targets, this can be turned in a very
efficient thing by means of userspace. On other setups this can be nice
and pleasant one, with yet another L10N project, recently promoted by
README translations. But,,, see problem above.
