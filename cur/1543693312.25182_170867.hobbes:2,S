Well, the normal case for me and other people not using any hot-pluggable
devices will be to run a hotplug agent that does absolutely nothing... so
in my case, the proposed patch would help - more memory available for the
normal work I do.
With a static /dev and no hotpluggable stuff around, there is no need
for and hotplug agent being there at all. And I do think such system
are not too uncommon, so considering them would probably be nice.
