Matter of scale, did you try a full kernel build with make -j bzImage 
using whatever your normal config is?
I still believe this is an innappropriate test, sure if you have tons 
of RAM and swap it may eventualy complete (though if the swapfile is 
very active and this is tried on a 2.4 kernel, the amount of CPU time 
the compile will actually get will likely be unpredictable at best.) 
This is an option that does nothing less than flood the system with 
hundreds or thousands of processes that on any large compile will 
simply not allow the system to survive intact without killing all the 
processes. Does the OOM killer even work correctly yet? Or does it 
still try to kill init at times? And for that matter, what order does 
it kill in?
