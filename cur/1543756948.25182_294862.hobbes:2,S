Re: ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR depending on ACPI or ACPI_INTERPRETER -- either
are fine.
Note that I'm planning to delete the separate ACPI_INTERPRETER build
option and just use CONFIG_ACPI in the future.  We tested this in a
config clean-up in -mm a while back, and I should probably revive it for
early 2.6.12.  The reason is that there really isn't a valid concept of
ACPI without the interpreter -- it can't even be used for configuring
interrupts without the interpreter on hand.
thanks,
