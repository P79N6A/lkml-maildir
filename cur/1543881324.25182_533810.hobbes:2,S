Actually, no ... this has to be size >> PAGE_SHIFT.  The reason being
that the  allocator is designed to allocate pages out of a device memory
buffer.  If the size isn't a multiple of page size, we have to round
down (we can't allocate the last page if the memory we have is only part
of a page).
I suppose if you want to catch the unlikely nutcase where size <
PAGE_SIZE you could
if (unlikely(pages == 0))
	goto out;

This is fine, except the BYTES_PER_LONG.  Traditionally, we do this with
sizeof(long).  The only reason to have a #define for it is if it has to
be used in a macro (the compiler does sizeof() not the preprocessor).
How about just a simple
int bitmap_size = BITS_TO_LONGS(pages) * sizeof(long);
?
Then you don't need the first patch defining BYTES_PER_LONG.
