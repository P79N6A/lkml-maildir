Pn a machine with 64MB RAM + 500 MB swap partition, I was running X and
using the display program from the ImageMagick package to view a quite
large image so the system needed to swap and used ~46MB of the swap
partition. I noticed that the system seemed sluggish and afterwards
found this in the syslogs:
kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for squid...
Squid was just idling.
I was seeing this a lot in 2.2.16 but this is the first time with the
pre17* kernels.
Thanks.
