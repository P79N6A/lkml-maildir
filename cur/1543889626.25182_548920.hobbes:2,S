Btw, this is where things like "udevd" can be really problematic. That 
whole "uevent over netlink" stuff is really nasty for things like this.
It's quite possible that even for user-level threads, we simply MUST NOT 
freeze them the way we do. Exactly because of deadlocks.
I'm personally really really convinced that the whole freezer thing is a 
total disaster. I don't know how anybody can even imagine anything else. 
It's simply deadlock city.
We should freeze IO, not processes.
