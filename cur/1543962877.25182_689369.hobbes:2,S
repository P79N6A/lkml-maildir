Hi,
I am trying to port the "piping cores to an executable" to
our kernel (2.6.10 based). I took Andi Kleen's patch (3/3)
available at 
http://lwn.net/Articles/195310/
 and some of
the supporting functions from 2.6.19. But it's not working
for me.
Andi's patch mentions "Using the infrastructure created in 
previous patches implement support to pipe core dumps into 
programs."
Can somebody point me to these previous patches ?
Thanks,
Ravi
