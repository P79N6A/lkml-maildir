It doesn't make me happy either.

These are supported features and I can't remove them from the
kernel (much as I would like to simply kill xconfig).
The best I know how to do is write a common front end with a static
parser.  Then you would automatically get checking even with 'make config'.

Go get 2.3.18ac9 and *run* "make config" on it and tell me if it works.
I haven't, but I'd be really surprised if it did.  Bash doesn't like
missing "then" keywords either.

Ok, I don't need to talk to you any more, because even though lots of
your criticism is valid, you haven't spent five minutes reading the
*existing* documentation in Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt,
let alone looking at my new code.
