Have a high prio thread msync()ing every now and then? OOps forget it,
I never said that, it is really a lame solution :) you can run in all
kinds of trouble.
Or maybe it is not that lame if you know *exactly* when do you need
the flush (for example, some other program is going to access the data);
this way you can signal the process who did the modification for it
to issue an msync(). However, this is going to be some delicate
synchronization
between the two apps.
