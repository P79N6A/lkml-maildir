I complained about this a year ago, but not much has changed. :-( It gets esp 
bad if you copy GB size files (the writes are the problemmakers, less the 
reads) - no matter which io scheduler I use, though using deadline seems to 
lessen the impact a little bit. And I don't find it acceptable to have to 
play around with nice to get a responsible desktop, esp when one is using a 
GUI.
Cheers,
