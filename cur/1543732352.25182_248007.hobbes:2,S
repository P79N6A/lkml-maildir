COW files would be nice as well, but I meant another thing: for files
which are parts of an uncompressed archive, it makes sense, if the fs
offers it efficiently, to share the storage.
Doing it properly requires that memory is also shared, for example
when COW files are used to isolate trees in virtual server jails, you
still want the mapped executables to share memory.
You can't do that just by writing a plugin.

Actually we don't.  The VM and VFS layers could deduce it with no
changes to cp(1), by tracking which pages are identical due to read(3)
and write(3).  However, changing cp(1) is easier.
reiser4 support is obviously the first prerequisite...
