I think Eric brings up a good point.  Perhaps we should rename  
feature-removal-schedule.txt to future-abi-changes.txt and start  
including other kinds of predicted future ABI changes and  
incompatibilities.  For example the sysfs class API changes which are  
planned are not feature removals but API changes, and as such could  
be usefully mentioned and tentatively assigned a date of  
implementation.  Something like that wouldn't add a _lot_ of extra  
work, but would help developers more carefully consider the extent of  
all their ABI changes.
