Why not commit versions on sync and close. That would seem to carry the least
surprise for the user. When I sync a filesystem/dir that would seem like a time
to make sure any changes make it to disk. And when a file is closed you don't
expect any more changes to that file.

Why teach current tools anything about it at all? Make this a tool you run on
the filesystem. If you _need_ to see earlier versions, it far past time to be
hoping emacs did the right thing.
