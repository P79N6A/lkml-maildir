O_DIRECT is synchronous but only in terms of data, if you want the
metadata to be synchronous as well you need to open with
O_SYNC|O_DIRECT, and even in such case all the metadata reads will came
from cache.
For example if you only care about being able to reach the data after a
crash (not about the inode info) in a file with all its logical blocks
mapped to physical blcoks (no holes) and then you fsync, later you can
as well avoid O_SYNC and you still don't risk to lose data after a crash
because the block mappings never changes, if you grow/shrink the file
you definitely need O_SYNC to be sure the O_DIRECT data is still there
after a crash instead.
