Subject: [PATCH 2.6.25-rc2 8/9] Kconfig: Improve init/Kconfig help descriptions - SLAB
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/21/478

Rewrite the help descriptions for clarity, accuracy and consistency.
Kernel config options affected:
  - SLUB_DEBUG
  - SLAB
  - SLUB
  - SLOB
