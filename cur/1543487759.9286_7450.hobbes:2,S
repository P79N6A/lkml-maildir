im having problems with cdparanoia locking up after a few cd's  while im
running several instances of bladeenc in the background...  i was told
it might be a dma buffer problem with the kernel? :( help :)
bladeenc runs fine, cdparanoia reads the id of the cd and then the cdrom
activity light stops and cdparanoia just locks, i have to kill the
task...... it happens after about 5-10 cds...  its different every time,
and logging out of X and re-entering X seems to cure the problem
somewhat.
