So, you are supposed to get a consistent filesystem structure, but your
data consistency isn't guaranteed.

What did XFS do to detect filedata-corruption before it was added to the
vanilla-kernel?
Maybe it did not update the metadata before the fs was sync'd?
Really, it should wait for fs sync and then update metadata!
This would imply 2 syncs in succession to ensure updated filedata/metadata
consistency, which is OK.
Is it possible to instruct XFS to delay metadata update until after a
filedata sync?
Thanks!
