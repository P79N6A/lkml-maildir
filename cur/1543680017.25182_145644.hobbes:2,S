Subject: [PATCH] O3int interactivity for 2.5.74-mm2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Attached is an incremental patch against 2.5.74-mm2 with more interactivity 
work. Audio should be quite resistant to skips with this, and it should not 
induce further unfairness.
Changes:
The sleep_avg buffer was not needed with the improved semantics in O2int so it 
has been removed entirely as it created regressions in O2int.
A small change to the idle detection code to only make tasks with enough 
accumulated sleep_avg become idle.
Minor cleanups and clarified code.
Other issues:
Jerky mouse with heavy page rendering in web browsers remains. This is a 
different issue to the audio and will need some more thought.
The patch is also available for download here:
http://kernel.kolivas.org/2.5
Note for those who wish to get smooth X desktop feel now for their own use, 
the granularity patch on that website will do wonders on top of O3int, but a 
different approach will be needed for mainstream consumption.
