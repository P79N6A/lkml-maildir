If the disk remaps a bad sector shouldn't that be completely transparent
to the rest of the world? It would be funny if my harddrive decided to
remap a couple of sectors, how is my OS ever going to find out? And I
think that if you write a sectore and the write succeeds you can be sure
that you can read the sector afterwards, unless the harddrive breaks
inbetween :)
