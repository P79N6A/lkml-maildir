d) None of the above!
I've never really thought about it, but I think it's simply a natural
side-effect of the register_filesystem and vfs_kern_mount it has to
do in order to get the services it needs from the VFS.
If I were to look back in history, I expect I'd find that it used
to display as "shmfs" or "shmemfs" rather than "tmpfs", and that
we adjusted the naming later on.   You might prefer that we hadn't,
or that we registered under both names if CONFIG_TMPFS (maybe we did
do it like that at one stage, I vaguely remember but haven't checked).

Sorry, I find it hard to get excited about!
I'm inclined not to mess around with it now.
With apologies to your sanity ;)
