Hi!
After problems with SB Live!, I tried getting another PCI card:
0000:03:03.0 Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq 5880 AudioPCI (rev
02)
no luck :-(. Now, this is quite a strange machine (dual core), but
does anyone have any clues? I tried OSS driver, and it did not work,
so I went back to ALSA:
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.11rc2 (Wed Jan 04
08:57:20 2006 UTC).
