None of the Zaurus models use pxa_keys so I don't know why you're
compiling this. I'll sort it out but its only needed for the hx2750 in
the tree you have.

I'm not sure why you'd want to do that?
I'll move the akita code around and sort out the #ifdefs - it should
compile and just throw the odd warning about unused code as it stands
though?
