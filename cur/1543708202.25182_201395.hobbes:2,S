Hi all,
I have a compaq evo n1015v laptop with 
a Texas Instruments PCI1410 PC card Cardbus Controller (rev 02)
and with kernel 2.4.24 I had no problem loading
yenta_socket module 
but with kernel 2.6.3 I get and mce (machine
check exception) error
doing /etc/init.d/pcmcia start
if I include ports 0x100-0x4ff
in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts
the workaround of course is to prevent such ports
from being probed or to use nomce kernel option but I wonder if there's
any
bug in yenta_socket driver of kernel 2.6.3,
thanks for your attention
Cristiano
