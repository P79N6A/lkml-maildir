Hi!
 Currently I am writing a scanner backend (SANE) for the AVISION AC630CS
 flatbed scanner.
 Unfortunatly its seems, that there is something wrong with it.
 So, before I will get nuts, a question: 
 Is there any problem known concerning the generic SCSI-command interface
 in kernel v.2.3.5?
 How often I tried to send the "SET WINDOW" command I received a failure
 reported by "REQUEST SENSE" and the following from the kernel debugging
 facility:
 Jun 20 13:04:08 solfire kernel: sym53c875-0-<2,0>: extraneous data discarded. 
 Jun 20 13:04:08 solfire kernel: sym53c875-0-<2,0>: COMMAND FAILED (89 2) @c0031000
 From my point of view all length-fields are correctly set.
 Any idea?
 KEEP HACKING!
