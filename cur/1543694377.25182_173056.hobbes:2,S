To be fair, I talked to someone who claims that Venti now checks for
hash collisions on writes, but that's not what the original paper
describes and I haven't confirmed it.
The compare-by-hash paper is only 6 pages long, at least take the time
to read it before you start using compare-by-hash:
http://www.usenix.org/events/hotos03/tech/henson.html
Abstract:
 "Recent research has produced a new and perhaps dangerous technique
  for uniquely identifying blocks that I will call
  compare-by-hash. Using this technique, we decide whether two blocks
  are identical to each other by comparing their hash values, using a
  collision-resistant hash such as SHA-1. If the hash values match,
  we assume the blocks are identical without further ado. Users of
  compare-by-hash argue that this assumption is warranted because the
  chance of a hash collision between any two randomly generated blocks
  is estimated to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the chance
  of many kinds of hardware errors. Further analysis shows that this
  approach is not as risk-free as it seems at first glance."
