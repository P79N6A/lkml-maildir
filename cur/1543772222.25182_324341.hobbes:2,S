They're rolling release candidates for GCC 4.0.1 at the moment, so I
expect it to be out early next week. I'll simply recommend people wait
for the 4.0.1 release.
I get 2-3 messages per day, steadily, from people with various kernel
and GCC problems. Since I'm not exactly a kernel developer, I wonder why
they think *I* have answers.
Must be Google's fault... ;)
