	:-)
	According to 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.16.62
the last commit to this version was made at Mon, 21 Jul 2008 22:48:10
+0300. Looks like it's really stable ;-)
	BTW, several distros keep patching 2.6.18, that's a bit fresher; but
anyway, there's a valuable gap between that stable and kernel.org's
advertised one.
