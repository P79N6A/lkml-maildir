They aren't being copied twice.  Look at getname() in fs/namei.c, and
note the call to audit_getname().  The native Linux 2.6 audit framework
combines processing at entry/exit with certain hooks placed at key
locations to collect the necessary information, without requiring the
degree of invasiveness of the SGI CAPP auditing patches of long ago.
