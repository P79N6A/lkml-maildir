There I disagree. I would do it the other way up. Post 2.4 you make the
ethtool ioctl simply build an eth_physical and run in that way. Right now
the ethtool stuff is a bit hackish and cannot handle upcoming real world
situations such as setting the cryptokey for onboard crypto on ethernet
cards, or handling devices that present themselves as ethernet but are not
at the physical layer being remotely honest about it.
