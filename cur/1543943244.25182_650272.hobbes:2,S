OK I would like to implement the freeze feature on VFS
as the filesystem independent ioctl so that it can be
available on filesystems that have already had write_super_lockfs()
and unlockfs().
The usage for the freeze ioctl is the following.
  int ioctl(int fd, int FIFREEZE, long *timeval);
    fd:file descriptor of mountpoint
    FIFREEZE:request cord for freeze
    timeval:timeout period (second)
And the unfreeze ioctl is the following.
  int ioctl(int fd, int FITHAW, NULL);
    fd:file descriptor of mountpoint
    FITHAW:Request cord for unfreeze
I think we need the timeout feature which thaws the filesystem
after lapse of specified time for a fail-safe in case the freezer
accesses the frozen filesystem and causes a deadlock.
I intend to implement the timeout feature on VFS.
(This is realized by registering the delayed work which calls
thaw_bdev() to the delayed work queue.)
Any comments are very welcome.
Cheers, Takashi
