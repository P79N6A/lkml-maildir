1.2.2-4??  That is ancient, and there was a bug in knfsd's rmdir
operation which could cause exactly these symptoms.  Please upgrade to
knfsd-1.4.7 and see if you can reprodce the problem.
We know that (a) dodgy hardware and (b) the knfsd problem can explain
huge numbers of these reports, but it's hard to completely exclude the
possibility of other faults in the current kernels.  It would really
help to eliminate variables if you could go to a more recent knfsd.
