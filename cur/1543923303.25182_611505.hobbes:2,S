No.  On ARM it depends on the configuration.  It's not an architectural
thing.  For example, someone might decide to stuff a PCI bus with 64 bit
addressing onto an ARM CPU.  Anyone without that definitely does not want
64 bit resources.
Some ARM systems with PCI busses, the PCI is added via means of an
external chip.  You can't predict whether any particular SoC will have
a PCI bus, or whether it'll be 32-bit or 64-bit.
