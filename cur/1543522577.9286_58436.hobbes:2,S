I agree.  ;o)

No.  I'm 100% Canadian.  Ontario specifically.

I think it depends more on the percentage of Crypto free
countries to Crypto-paranoid countries, as well as the dominance
of those countries in the world market.  In other words, if every
country in the world allows crypto - except IRAQ, Ethiopia, and
the like, then I say we should "go with crypto".  If Russia, USA,
or any other major world powers do not allow crypto (like the
USA, and previously France) then it would be bad to put it in -
if not illegal.

Well let me restate that I think crypto should go in the standard
kernel *UNLESS* some major world power (country) has strong
anti-crypto laws that would cause a problem for the usage of
Linux in that country, or for a possible core developer in that
country.  Small countries with small population are relatively
irrelevant IMHO... either way.
Crypto is GOOD for us, and good for the world.  We just have to
be careful thats all.

>the use of strong crypto - or my brain becomes all but holes...)
Hmm.. That is bad then.  Russia is important IMHO.  This brings
up a point:
How many countries out there that have a significant population
or impact on the world - have strong crypto laws still?
