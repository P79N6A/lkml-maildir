Unless I'm missing something, this is completely normal.  You're using 
78M of memory once buffers are factored out.  Seems reasonable for a
just-started system.
For comparison, here's a moderately loaded machine running 2.2.19:
[doug@scooby doug]$ free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:           505        480         24        137         42        278
-/+ buffers/cache:        159        345
Swap:          101          0        101
Are you actually seeing performance problems or are you just worried
about the 'free' output?
