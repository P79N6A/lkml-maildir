Probably because the QuikWay Merced Simulation could not resolve the
timing issues between real hardware access.  Given the arbitrary nature of
the total number of ticks not mapped back to a realistic usable value,
the kernel<>kernel may not be able to maintain stablity.
Or they hired there own internal guys in the Washington State area, and
are going back behind closed doors.
Take your pick, but I know nothing at all.................or just enough.
