The consoel does need more work than that. Since the console system was
designed for one head than the code was naturally SMP safe. When you have
SMP and a multiheaded system you have the change of two heads running at
the same time. This can run into severe problems. Also what do you do for
systems that have two framebuffers and one keyboard. Or two keyboards and
one framebuffer. Their is need to support 16 bit characters so you can
display asian languages. So many changes are in store for the console
system.
  As for fbcon. Yes we are working on making it as multiheaded as much as
possible without touching the console code.

Don't worry I will be working on this right after 2.4.x comes out.
