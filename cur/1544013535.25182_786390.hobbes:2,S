Have to be careful for IPv6 addresses - '::' is a legal representation of
an all-zeros address.  Also, N.U.L.L. may give indigestion to logfile parsers
that are expecting a numeric value in the IP address.  It's however unclear
whether we should pick something that doesn't have 3 periods in it, so it
can't match, or whether *that* will give regexp-based logfile readers
indigestion when they don't pick up an IP address where they expected...
Do we want the %pI6 format to do the multiple-zeros -> :: compression?
