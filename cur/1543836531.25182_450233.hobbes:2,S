Doesnt the ability to move tasks between groups dynamically affect
(atleast) memory controller design (in giving up ownership etc)?
Also if we need to support this movement, we need to have some
corresponding system call/file-system interface which supports this move 
operation.

The use cases I have heard of which would benefit such a feature is
(say) for database threads which want to change their "resource
affinity" status depending on which customer query they are currently handling. 
If they are handling a query for a "important" customer, they will want affinied
to a high bandwidth resource container and later if they start handling
a less important query they will want to give up this affinity and
instead move to a low-bandwidth container.
