Hello all ..,
I have compiled the kernel in IA64 as 
make menuconfig
make all
make modules
But in this step i got the following messages as 
make modules
make[1]: `arch/ia64/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  Building modules, stage 2.

After installing the module-init-tools-0.9.tar.bz2 to update the 
module tool and in the make install i got the 
no ./install-with-care for all files in /bin/sh.Then i have changed 
the ./install-with-care for as ./install-sh
So what is the this effect and what is the problem on the above 
messages on 2.6.0test3 on Ia64.then there is no interfaces to eth0 
eth1 ,so i cannot take the testings.But the entires for the 
ifcfg-eth0 and ifcfg-eth1 are there.
So i need the guidlines for this...
Thanks
Mvthv
