with slackware you need to NFS export the slakware directory from the CD
on one machine.
with slackware 8
the on the 386 boot from the boot disk, then the root disk, then type
network and put in the network driver floppy. when the NIC is detected
then go through the setup menu and choose the 'install from nfs' option.
e-mail me directly if you have more questions, this is now off-topic for
this list.
