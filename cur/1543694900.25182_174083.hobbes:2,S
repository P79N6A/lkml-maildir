It seems an odd fix though, the variable tty_nr is at most set once
inside the function, and is inaccessible to other functions so why it
should be volatile seems unclear to me. It might solve the compilation
(now that I look again the original error messages mention gcc internal
representation, so the suggestion of binutils at fault seems unwarranted)
but that seems by accident, not by design?
Perhaps if the huge sprintf with 40+ arguments (fs/proc/array.c, line 346)
amongst which several trinary operators, were to be split up into several
parts, might that not solve the problem more elegantly?
