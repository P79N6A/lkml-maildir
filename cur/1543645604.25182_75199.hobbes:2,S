Same problem on ARM.  I just haven't got the motivation to rewrite the
bits of the kernel that need to be rewritten to make it work.
Have you checked that your pte/pmd allocation functions can be called
from IRQ context as well?
You basically need:
 - irq-safe get_vm_area
 - irq-safe pmd_alloc_kernel
 - irq-safe pte_alloc_kernel
Last time I looked, all the above were not irq-safe.
