Well 8250_pci.c mentions IT8871, so it is probably 8250 style in
interface then.

How many serial ports is your kernel configured to use?
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS=16
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS=4
That is from my Debian system's kernel, and it won't activate more than
4 ports automatically.  It will allow up to 16 to be activated though.
I don't remember what the boot command is to override those values to
make the system look for more ports.
