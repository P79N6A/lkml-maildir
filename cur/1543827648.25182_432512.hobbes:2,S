Ah, right, I overlooked that case. But, is it really a leak? That is,
even though we currently don't have a pointer to the beginning fo the
block, we don't know for sure it was a leak. You're now allowed to do:
    p = kmalloc(...);
    p = p + HDR_SIZE;
    /* ... */
    kfree(p - HDR_SIZE);
Do you think we should ban the above?
