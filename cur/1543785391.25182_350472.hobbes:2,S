Thanks.
I still can't figure out what causes my sparc64 bug.  Somehow a
kmalloc() chunk of file pointers gets freed too early, the SLAB is
shrunk due to memory pressure so the page containing that object gets
freed, that page ends up as an anonymous page in userspace, but filp
writes from the older usage occurs and corrupts the page.
I wonder if we simply leave a stale pointer around to the older
fd array in some case.
