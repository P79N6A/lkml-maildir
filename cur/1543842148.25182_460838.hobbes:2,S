The problem is still there under 2.6.18-rc2. I narrowed it down to ext3 
journal. To reproduce one just has to mount an ext3 partition and perform 
(write) accesses to it. A loop { touch /mnt/foo; sleep 1; } suffices - 
just let it run for a couple of minutes and monitor buffer_head in 
/proc/slabinfo. If you mount it as ext2 the problem is gone.
Thanks
