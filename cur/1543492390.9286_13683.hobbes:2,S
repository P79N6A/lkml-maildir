something like a generic driver that simply allows userland drivers direct
hardware access.  Then the userland code could be just another process
like you describe.  The tricky bit would be tying this back into some sort
of tty device in a generic/sane manner.

well some sort of raw i/o driver would be all that is necissary right?
that should be small, and could be used for other things too.  Do we
allready have such a thing?

this gets back to the 'how to emulate a tty' question though, so as to not
have to add code to libc or something to support these devices.

sure is.
