the COW path lookup code already avoids taking the vcache lock - unless
the hash-head is non-empty.

yeah, this is the optimization i have described in the previous mail, and
which is in the patch.

i agree, first hashing the vcache should work. There are some details:  
if we first hash the vcache then we have to set up the queue in a way for
the callback function to notice that this queue is not futex-hashed (ie.  
not live) yet. Otherwise the callback function might attempt to rehash it.  
This means one more branch in the callback function, not a problem.
