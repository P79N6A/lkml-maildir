Well, register_cpu_notifier() is an exported function. There are several 
modules that use this today like cpufreq etc which disqualifies it to be
a init style function.
either that function should be devinit and be present premanently, or
should be mapped to null macro for correctness.
Otherwise module loaders will start to oops when they call into 
register.
