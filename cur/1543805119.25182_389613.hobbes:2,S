Currently libc and most other system libraries have text segments smaller
than 2MB, so they won't share anyway.  We can't even coalesce adjacent
libraries since the linker puts unshareable data space after each library.
The main win for text sharing is applications with large text in the
program itself.  As long as that's loaded at the same address we'll share
page tables for it.
I thought the main security benefit for randomization of mapped regions was
for writeable data space anyway.  Isn't text space protected by not being
writeable?
