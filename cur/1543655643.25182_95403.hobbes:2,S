Hi,
I applied mm1 patch to kernel 2.5.51 and I ran LM bench to test its performance.
Here are the errors that I obtained.
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,6)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
ext3_free_blocks: aborting transaction: Journal has aborted in __ext3_journal_get_undo_access<2>
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,6)) in ext3_free_blocks: Journal has aborted
ext3_free_blocks: aborting transaction: Journal has aborted in __ext3_journal_get_undo_access<2>
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,6)) in ext3_free_blocks: Journal has aborted
ext3_reserve_inode_write: aborting transaction: Journal has aborted in __ext3_journal_get_write_access<2>
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,6)) in ext3_reserve_inode_write: Journal has aborted

EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,6)) in ext3_orphan_del: Journal has aborted

EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,6)) in ext3_reserve_inode_write: Journal has aborted

I had observered similar errors for mm2 patch for kernel 2.5.50. that patch was later removed from the site. It seems that the problem still persists. are changes in fs/ext3/balloc.c and fs/ext3/inode.c responsible for this ?
