Ok, make sense.  Nothing like the ide's 'hdx=foo' param?

Nope, its unpacking, compiling and installing glibc.  Sure, not _that_
extensive, but it does make it work a bit.  Might be some other
weirdness, as I did not try to reproduce it more than twice.
And then something else - gnome did not want to start due to missing
icons.  They are there however, and rebooting to old kernel without
libata worked fine (same kernel, just do not have the patch applied
or the normal ata driver disabled).
I will give it a go some more.  Currently I am having some issues with
getting latest cvs glibc & nptl to play nice, so I will not take it too
serious for now.  If anything obvious might cause it and you want me
to test, ask.  Otherwise I will give it a good run in the next few
weeks and get a more complete report.
Thanks,
