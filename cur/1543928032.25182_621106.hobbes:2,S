Sure -- Andi's example of symbols required only by TCP congestion
modules; the SCSI internals that Christoph wants to mark; the symbols
exported by my mlx4_core driver (which I admit are currently only used
by the mlx4_ib driver, but which will also be used by at least the
ethernet NIC driver for the same hardware).  I thought this was
already covered repeatedly in the thread and indeed in Andi's code so
there was no need to repeat it...
