Hello!
   It turned out that recently introduced additional journal check
   breaks journal replays on filesystems created with old reiserfs
   tools that did not write journal parameters into superblock.

# reiserfs: Fix recenly introduced journal sanity check that breaks replay on old filesystems.
#   This fixes recently introduced transaction length check. Our
#   initial checks missed the case of filesystem created with old
#   reiserfsprogs that do not write max transaction length into
#   superblock. Zeroes were written there, so all transactions were
#   considered invalid.
