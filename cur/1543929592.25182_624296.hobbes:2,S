As for the internal-with-flags implementation, I once proposed
something like below but it was rejected by Jens.
(
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118880584720600&w=2
)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
static int internal_function(rq, needlock)
{
	end_that_request_chunk(rq);
	if (needlock)
		spin_lock_irqsave();
	end_that_request_last(rq);
	if (needlock)
		spin_unlock_irqrestore();
}
int blk_end_request(rq)
{
	return internal_function(rq, 1);
}
int __blk_end_request(rq)
{
	return internal_function(rq, 0);
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As for the holding-queue-lock-longer implementation,
end_that_request_chunk() completes bios in the request and it can
reaches filesystem layer and may take time.
I guess many drivers like scsi are calling end_that_request_chunk()
without queue's lock because of the reason above.
I'll try to remove the duplication again by another patch-set
after blk_end_request interfaces are merged.
So I would like to leave the duplication for now.
Is it acceptable for you?
Thanks,
