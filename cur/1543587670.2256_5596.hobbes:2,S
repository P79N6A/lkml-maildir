In 1999 I setup a Linux kernel 2.2 box to monitor traffic for about 2500
hosts.  I created two rules for each host (to monitor inbound and
outbound).  I had over 5000 total rules on a Pentium II 300 Mhz box.  I
wrote some perl glue so I could accounts on a per customer basis (each
customer had one or more IPs, not necessarily contiguous) and graph the
results in MRTG.
There was ZERO performance problems on the box.  The box is still
runningly happily today.  I don't there is a "problem" to fix.
