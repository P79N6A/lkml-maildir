Another way of doing this is to save these values in the task structure.  If 
null, use the direct value of stime, utime, if not, adjust by the saved value 
(i.e. saved value would represent time zero).

Please, when sending patches, attach them.  This avoids problems with mailers, 
on both ends, messing with white space.  They still appear in line, at least in 
some mailers (mozilla in my case).
As to the test program, what happens when you attempt to set up a timer on these 
clocks?  (No, I don't think it should work, but we DO want to properly error 
out.  And the test should verify that this happens.)  By the way, if you use the 
support package from sourceforge, you will find a lot of test harness stuff.
