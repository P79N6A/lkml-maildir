Subject: [PATCH 6/7] [hrtimers] Add back lost credit lines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/19/426

At some point we added credits to people who actively helped
to bring k/hr-timers along. This was lost in the big code
revamp. Add it back.
