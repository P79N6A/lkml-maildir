Subject: Request to have get_blkfops() and get_chrfops() exported to kerne l modules
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This is a request to have both the linux kernel symbols
get_chrfops and get_blkfops exported to kernel modules
in future releases of the linux kernel.
This request is in response to a need we have when building
kernel modules which will filter block and/or character device
i/o by trapping the native block/character i/o requests.
We propose three source modifications as part of this request.
Furthermore, assuming approval of this request, we will supply
a source patch to effect these modifications.
	1)	EXPORT_SYMBOL references for both get_charfops and
		get_blkfops be placed in fs/devices.c.
	2)	Removal of the static scope qualifier for the 
		definition of get_chrfops() in fs/devices.c.
	3)	The file devices.o be added to the list of exported
		in fs/Makefile.
