I'm not sure why I never hit the same bug that Jeremy did
(again, maybe subtle hardware differences between our models),
but I finally got somewhere.   -rc7 with the same config I've
been testing exhibited exactly the same bug.   Disabling
the FB_BACKLIGHT option (and all the FB drivers that 'select' it),
I get a working display on resume again.
This makes a lot of sense. As before, when I resumed, the backlight
wasn't coming back on, but I knew the machine was alive, as
capslock was working.  (Amusingly, I never noticed the backlight
wasn't coming back on until tonight, when I started debugging this
with the lights off.  Late-night debugging ftw).
I'll try and narrow down exactly where it's failing in the
backlight code next, but it's getting late here, so I may
leave this until tomorrow for further investigation.
Some other clues for anyone playing along at home:
This X60 has Intel graphics.  ie, I'm not using any of
the drivers that 'select FB_BACKLIGHT', so somewhere in
the common fb code is code that I'm guessing is dependant
upon the framebuffer driver doing something or other
if FB_BACKLIGHT is set.
(Adding Richard to Cc: as he seems to be responsible for
 the FB backlight code from what I can tell.)
