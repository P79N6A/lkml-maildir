The result of their attempts has seemed to be the exact opposite
so far, so I'd say they're either hiding a bit too much or the
hardware doesn't cut it.

Are you suggesting something to the point of Windows not having
to cope with the same issues?  There has to be some kind of fundamental
difference given Promise themselves successfully hosed the Linux driver
the instant they touched it, while the Windows one just works. :)
