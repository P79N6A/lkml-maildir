Rik, before solving it, lets identify the problem. I still cannot
reproduce your testcase.
i've tested this on a 2-CPU box now which shows the same thing as a 4-CPU
one: i have started up 2 CPU-hog processes and reniced them. xosview went
all yellow for both CPUs, thats all fine and expected. Then i started up 2
CPU eaters again, and xosview went all green for both CPUs, except a small
~10% part that was yellow (the two idled processes). So the scheduler has
nicely distributed the two 'normal priority' processes. Interactive
performance was still perfect. So, what should i do to see your problem?
