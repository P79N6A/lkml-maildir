Dear All,
    I use Red Hat 7.2. I have unused partition of hard disk in many computer
in my network. I want to combine this space into a big one. I plan to use
network block device, is there any documentation? Where can I download
nbd-server and nbd-client?
    What's about iscsi? Can linux act as a iscsi server?
Thanks,
Theewara
