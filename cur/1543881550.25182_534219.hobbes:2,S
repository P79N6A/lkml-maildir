I will, thanks.
A couple questions (as far as udev behaviour is sooooooo distro dependent):
- What should I have in /dev if I don't use legacy ptys ? As I understand
  it, only /dev/ptmx and /dev/pts/*, no /dev/tty* nor /dev/pty* ?
- If my setup, for whatever strange reasons has /dev/tty* stored anyware
  (/dev/.udev, links.conf...) and they get created, I supose that opening
  /dev/tty will give a ENODEV ?
TIA
