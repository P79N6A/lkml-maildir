That limit of 168 hours applies all around the world to everyone.
Moreover, not all kernel developers are employed to hack on the
kernel for 168 hours a week.
For me, personally, that figure is in reality about 24 hours a
week.  Yes, just 24.  The rest of the time (like *now*) is time I'm
volunteering because I happen to be reading my email...
... and happen to be wasting replying to discussions like this rather
than reading that message which has just arrived on the ARM kernel
mailing list from someone having problems using copy_from_user()
with a kernel pointer.
So, please, stop this idea that somehow kernel developers can
somehow spend infinite amounts of time solving lots and lots of
bugs.
