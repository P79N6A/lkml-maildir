I have to find some script that checks for the damned tabs.

We could remove the locking for single read/writes, devmap structures
are never deleted so it is safe to access a single value after the
dasd_find_busid. But it is not so easy for the vendor and serial string,
these are not single values so we need some kind of locking. To keep
things symmetrical the lock is used for alias as well. There is a bug
though, only the pointer to the vendor/serial string is read under the
lock, the copy is done outside the lock. If that races with a
dasd_set_uid call funny things might happen. The copy needs to be done
inside the lock. Horst ?
