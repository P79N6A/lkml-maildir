This isn't such a silly idea, really.
How much code would be required for a default, completely brainless 
scheduler?  That's built-in.  When you load a new scheduler, the default 
one doesn't get kicked out; it just gets turned off.  When you unload, 
the default takes over.
The only major issue is that the data structures used to manage 
processes would be different from one scheduler to the next.  One 
possible answer would be to have an unloading driver translate all of 
its process information into the default scheduler's format.  A newly 
loaded one would translate it to its own format.  Things that would be 
lost in the translation include interactivity information, etc.
Please forgive my total ignorance about how processes are represented in 
data structures in the linux kernel.
