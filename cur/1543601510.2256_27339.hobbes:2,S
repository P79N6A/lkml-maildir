very clear now, thanks. I though the fs you were talking about was
mounted on the blkdev, while it is instead the one where the blkdev
inode cames from. Usually people keeps bldkev in /dev and nobody
unmounts /dev that's why I didn't noticed and thought about it, sorry.

the only info we'd need from the host is the host->i_rdev, so why can't
we get it from the file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_rdev? In general I don't
like very much the fake inodes with the zillon of unused fields (they
just looks confusing due their unused fields), but well if you for
whatever reason prefer to keep doing page->mapping->host->i_rdev or if
file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_rdev has a problem I'm pretty much ok with
the fake_inode there too.
