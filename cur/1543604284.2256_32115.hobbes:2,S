I haven't rebooted since this happened; the error
occurred when I resumed from hibernation.
In any case, I suspect that the BIOS reset whatever
register it was that was incorrectly set.  Here again
is the output of the sbf program that cause the problem.
I ran the "sbf-0.3" version of the program, modified
to ignore the parity error on the value read back from the
register.
root@thanatos:/home/jdthood/src/sbf# ./a.out
BOOT @ 0x07fd0040
CMOS register: 0x33
Read current value := 0x88
Read updated value := 0x89
We need to come to a better understanding of what it's doing
differently from bootflag.c, which writes to the right place.

Thomas
