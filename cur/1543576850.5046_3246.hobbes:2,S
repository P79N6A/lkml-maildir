     For my development testing, I'm running a _heavily_ hacked
   kernel.  One of these hacks is to pull the wait_queue_head out of
   struct page; the waitq-heads are in a separate allocated area of
   memory, with a waitq-head pointer embedded in the page structure
   (allocated/initialised in free_area_init_core()).  This gives a
   page structure of 60bytes, giving me one free double-word to play
   with (which I'm using as a pointer to a release function).
Not something like those damn Solaris turnstiles, no please....
