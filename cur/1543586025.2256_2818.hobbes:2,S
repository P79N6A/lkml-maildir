This can be done with an lchmod() and support for setuid symlinks.
Read     can see where the link points
Write    ignored, or XOR the on-disk data with 0222 and...?
Execute  can follow the link
Setuid   link followed as for the owner
Setgid   link followed as for the owner's group
Sticky   reserved for future use
Then you get:
lr-sr-xr-x 1 root root 17 Mar 21 2000 /dev/null -> /devices/mem/null
