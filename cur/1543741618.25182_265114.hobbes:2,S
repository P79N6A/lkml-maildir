2.6.10.1, etc. suggests important bug fixes for 2.6.10, *not* prereleases
of 2.6.11. But... perhaps (with sufficient warning) the even/odd principle
could be applied to the third number. So, this would happen:
2.6.even   = release
2.6.even.x = release, with added bug/security fixes
2.6.odd    = first (zeroth?) -pre/-rc release
2.6.odd.x  = additional -pre/-rc releases
A more concrete example:
2.6.11-rc1, 2.6.11-rc2, 2.6.11-rc3, 2.6.11, 2.6.12-rc1, 2.6.12-rc2, 2.6.12
would become:
2.6.11,     2.6.11.1,   2.6.11.2,   2.6.12, 2.6.13,     2.6.13.1,   2.6.14
How does this sound? (It just occurred to me that this might break
scripts, but it may be worth discussing anyway.)
