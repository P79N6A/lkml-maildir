Hi,
I compiled 2.6.2-rc1 and I can't use my Pinnacle PCTV card because bbtv
module and friends refuse to load due to unknown i2c_* symbols. dmesg
relevant part is attached (kernel config is also - grep ^CONFIG -).
I suspect it's due to not setting these new options: CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE,
CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_BUS and CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CHIP.
Please let me know if I should provide any additional information.
Thanks.
