Subject: [BUG][PATCH] process events connector - uid_t gid_t size issues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Andrew,
	I noticed this follow up patch did not make it's way into -mm and
subsequently to 2.6.15-rc2. The uid_t and gid_t fields appear to present
a 32/64-bit userspace/kernel problem for some archs.
	This patch addresses the problem by fixing the size to the largest
size for uid_t/gid_t used in the kernel. This preserves the total size of
the event structure while ensuring that the layouts of the ID change event
match in 32 and 64-bit kernels and applications.
	Please apply.
