Hi,
I encounter a problem which baffles me, having built same release before
1) Checked 21-pre6 out from local BK tree
2) Patched with latest acpi and win4lin
3) make oldconfig
4) Made some config changes
5) make dep, bzImage, modules - use gcc295
6) Compiled w/o any problem
7) installed and reboot, cant load _any_ (0) modules
depmod reports missing symbols in all modules
For example modprobe 8390 reports unresolved symbols including: enable_irq, kmalloc, printk,disable_irq
*** It seems kernel symbols cant be accessed by modules
8) I rebuild all after making clean, same result
Where do I go wrong?
I can send complete build logs upon request.
Regards
Michael
