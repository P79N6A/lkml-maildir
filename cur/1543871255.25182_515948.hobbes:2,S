Perhaps using a config option wasn't the right way to do this - a kernel
boot parameter might be better.
In fact, one could envisage a kernel boot parameter "sysfs_version=N" which 
will allow distro people to select the sysfs-of-the-day which works with their
userspace.
Because it does appear that we need _something_ which will get us away from this
ongoing problem of needing to keep the kernel and userspace synchronised across
sysfs changes.
