using 2.6.11 everything works fine, Upgrading too 2.6.13-rc3 I noticed 2 errors,
(1) When setting the HZ rating too 250 or 100 will cause the driver to
excessfully repeat keys/accelerate when pressing a button, making it
unusable :(
(2) the "Ok" button no longer works in anything after and including
2.6.12-rc1 (I've tested upto 2.6.13-rc3), 2.6.11 works fine. xbindkeys
doesnt register any "ok" key presses on 2.6.12-rc1 onwards.
2.6.11 xbindkeys responses (nothing shows up in -rc1)
mediabawx2:~# xbindkeys -mk
Press combination of keys or/and click under the window.
You can use one of the two lines after "NoCommand"
in $HOME/.xbindkeysrc to bind a key.
--- Press "q" to stop. ---
"NoCommand"
m:0x0 + c:36
Return
"NoCommand"
m:0x0 + c:36
Return
Thanks :)
