My current project (and I'm just waiting for nfs and wvlan_cs to stabalize
on ARM before putting the final touches on it) is an ipaq nfsrooted to a
Debian image, over the wireless lan.  Works like a champ, and it -does-
compile stuff reasonably fast (well, reasonably fast considering the data
is all on the far side of 11M/sec wireless.)  My kit is mostly portable as
well, since the nfs server is on the libretto and runs just fine in my
backpack ;)
The next step is bludgeoning debian-arm into not running 50-100 little
servers I don't need on my PIM.  But that may be the function of a
task-nfs-ipaq package or some such.
So far -multiuser- linux on PIMs ("true" linux, with X, etc, as distinct
from pocketlinux/qpe/etc, which are a different animal in this case) is
almost there.  Web browsers are coming along nicely (and remote-X netscape
is usable, although barely) and there are several nice imap clients. (and
input methods ranging from a handwriting system to a little onscreen
keyboard, if you are in a situation where an external keyboard is not
feasable.)
