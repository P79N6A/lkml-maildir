This case is getting more rediculous with each day...lfmao
Oh dear, it seems that our /comments/ are alike.  Hrmm.  Pity the
compiller doesn't take any notice of them, and therefore, I don't see
the evidence that the /code/ has been stolen.  Also, as others have
quite rightfully pointed out, it doesn't even compile -- syntax errors
galore.
Lets hope some people in the legal profession have some C knowledge --
or at least have the sense to go directly to the kernel source on
kernel.org rather than relying on what SCO provides.
