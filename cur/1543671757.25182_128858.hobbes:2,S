Odd.. I use the vendor-provided 'ksh' on Solaris, AIX, and Tru64 (now an HP
product), and they all have supported re-editing the line just typed for
*years* (I can't prove it's over a decade, but I'm fairly sure it is).
Remember that a major reason for 'bash' being created was because of licensing
issues with the 'ksh' source.
