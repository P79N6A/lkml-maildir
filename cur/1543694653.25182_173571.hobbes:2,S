Hi all!
After applying 2.6.0-test8 patch, I were failed to compile kernel, because 
of changes in microcode.c
In function find_matching_ucodes() , line 326 written:
       int ext_table_sum = 0;
       i = ext_table_size / DWSIZE;
       int * ext_tablep = (((void *) newmc) + MC_HEADER_SIZE + data_size);
This is threated as error by gcc-2.95.3. But if you simple exchange second 
and third line, microcode.c became compilable by this version of GCC.
Is there any "preferred" version of gcc, which I should you to build 
kernel?
Hope I don.t bother you too much with this mess....
Nikita
