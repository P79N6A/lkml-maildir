Subject: modutils check for SMP

I have been asked to add an SMP check to modutils, the idea being to
complain if a module compiled for SMP is loaded into a UP kernel or
vice versa.  genksyms should catch this but not everybody compiles with
genksyms.
Are there any other kernel/module incompatibilities that cause problems
and could benefit from checking in modutils?
