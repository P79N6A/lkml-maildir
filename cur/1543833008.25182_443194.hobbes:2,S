I would like give a strong objection to the naming.  The -ve() suffix in 
execve() isn't jettisonable; it indicates its position within a family 
of functions (only one of which is a true system call.)
execven() would be better name (the -n argument coming after then -e 
argument).  The library could then provide execlen(), execlpn() etc as 
appropriate.
