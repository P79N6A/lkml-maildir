It makes sense to me.  PG_lazyfree is currently only in -mm, right?  I
don't see it in my git tree.  It would probably would be a good idea
to make sure that we check to add some sanity checking code if it
isn't there already that PG_lazyfree isn't already set when try to set
PG_lazyfree (just in case there is a bug in the future which causes
the should-never-happen case of trying lazy free a PageBooked page).
