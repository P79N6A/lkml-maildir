I found a solution of sorts on Fedora 6:
Edit /etc/rc0.d/S01halt, changing the third-from-last line so it reads:
HALTARGS="-d -h -n"
Then use the halt(8) command to shut down and turn off the power manually.
No click and the "retract" counter does not increment. (Even this procedure
incremented the counter until I changed the script.)
Seems safe, using the IDE drivers, since they sync the cache anyway.
