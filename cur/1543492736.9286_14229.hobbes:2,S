Doug
Actually when I checked again the sense buffer from the read right after
the low-level format quit was  Unit Attention,  Data Path Failure
(Should use 40 NN).  I haven't figured out what 40 NN is yet.  I guess
this message may not be surprising since I just did a low level format
on the disk.  Maybe things get lost between the write and the read.  
Your idea about the timeout is worth a try.  I am also going to try an
ioctl call to the sd* driver and see if that works.  
Let you know what happens.
Susan
