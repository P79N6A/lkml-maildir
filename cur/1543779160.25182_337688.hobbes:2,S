so that line (case 4, where 4 is _NSIG_WORDS) won't ever be
executed on this arch...
This is arch-independent code and it handles a variety of
values for _NSIG_WORDS.  I don't see a problem.
On "this architecture," case 2: will be executed:
	case 2: ready  = signal->sig[1] &~ blocked->sig[1];
		ready |= signal->sig[0] &~ blocked->sig[0];
		break;
