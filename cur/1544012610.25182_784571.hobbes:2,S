Hi Ben, Yes, exactly! Thanks!
Hi Robin,  I think the randomly or less ordered gpio case that you
raised should be solved using the existing gpio_set/get single bit
value API. I intended this startpin, mask and length based API is to
help drivers that would currently hit a performance limitation while
keeping it just sufficiently abstract that it can be accelerated on an
implementation specific basis without too much of a headache.
btw, about the term batch, I had looked it up originally and seen:
google define:batch
A collection of products or data which is treated as one entity with
respect to certain operations eg processing and production.
www.shipping.francoudi.com/main/main.asp
so I felt it was a sufficiently meaningful and matching term to use.
Also, I had used the term gpio_set_value_bus in the first patch to try
to be close to the existing gpio_set/get_value API. I switched to
gpio_set_batch because it was pointed out that _bus could be
misleading. All that said, I'm happy to change it to the term around
which consensus forms. :-)

I think as discussed above, these cases would be better solved using
the single bit set/get API.

I think we can do that for read/write but we'd need to break
consistency with the existing api. The existing gpio_set_value and
gpio_get_value don't offer an error return.

Agreed.

Robin, I agree with you that trying to achieve unstructured multiple
GPIO support is elegant. The start/length approach I've taken here is
definitely not as generic. But by giving up some pure abstraction,
we've gained in implementation simplicity for each platform. Also,
there's nothing in my patch that would in future prevent us from
adding the random capability via an API akin to what you've suggested.
I'd like to get the start/length approach out there and in-play to
find out if other people want to use it and how they end up using it.
Thanks,
jaya
