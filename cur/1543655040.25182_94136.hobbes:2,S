If your xfs[cvs] resembles the xfs source in 2.5.50-mm1, then it looks
to me like fs/xfs/linux has a .sendfile = linvfs_sendfile in xfs_file.c
(which assures the loop driver it can loop this file for reading), but
lacks a .vop_ioctl = xfs_sendfile (and its extern) in xfs_vnodeops.c.
But I've not delved into XFS, for all I know that code may not be ready
to use yet: Christoph can say.  And to get further with the 2.5.47 loop,
you'll also need this patch (in 2.5.48):
