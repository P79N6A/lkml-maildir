I think that under most calling conventions return values are put into
registers, so this shouldn't do anything other than keep the compiler from
reallocating the designated return register for a while.
Or, after a second or two of more thought, it might cause the function to trash
whatever value is contained in the return register, which the compiler thought
was safe from harm.  It all depends on the calling convention and whether the
caller assumes that the callee can destroy any registers or if the callee has to
save and restore the registers it uses.
