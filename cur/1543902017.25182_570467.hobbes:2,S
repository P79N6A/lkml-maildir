Subject: [PATCH (resend) 0/2] workqueue lockup debugging

I recently experienced a lockup in the wireless code due to the
scenario described in patch 1 and wanted to have lockdep warn
about such scenarios as a way to catch such bugs in other
subsystems as well as to make sure we wouldn't get such things
ever again.
In discussions with Oleg and Ingo it turned out that there's
another possible deadlock with the now-recommended API of
cancel_work_sync() and I also found a way to make lockdep
catch that; it is addressed by patch 2.
Ingo thinks this could also have caught a similar lockup in the
DVB subsystem and would like to see it in .23.
