Hello,
First, sorry if it's not the right place but after having googling for 
days, I didn't succed in finding some infos.
Since the kernel 2.6.12 (at least every 2.6.12 from Fedora Core 3) , I'm 
unable to generate useful core dumps with gcore.
I always have the following messages :
warning: The current VSYSCALL page code requires an existing execuitable.
Use "add-symbol-file-from-memory" to load the VSYSCALL page by hand
Then ,indeed, there no more symbols included in my core files, which 
makes them useless.
Is this a security issue ? (selinux is disabled) , a gdb one ? (gdb 
hasn't been updated since quite a long time )
Does someone know if there's an issue for that (a lot of my admin 
scripts rely on gcore so this is really annoying)
I havn't  this problem with 2.6.11 kernels but 2.6.12 solved a lot of 
other bugs so I'd rather use it.
Thanks.
