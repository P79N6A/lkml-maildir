Just because AIX didn't implement it the right way, doesn't mean it's a  
bad idea.
There's a reason I wanted to use more than just volume labels, you know,  
that reason being to avoid exactly this problem.
Because I've seen it on Netware servers (the partition named SYS is the  
one the system boots from, and you definitely don't want two same-name  
partitions in the system).
We *do* have more info available, though. Uuids, disk serial numbers, all  
sorts of stuff. Using those allows us to not run into that particular  
trap.

But we *don't* need to, for that scheme.
We're Linux, not AIX.
