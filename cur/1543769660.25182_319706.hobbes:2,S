Hmm, I just noticed the page I found about NPTL had 2005 date one place
and 2002 in another.  Yeah that is what people are using already.
Most current i386 systems do NOT use NPTL yet by default since it only
works on 2.6 kernels, and even then probably only if glibc was compiled
that way.

Hmm, I just ran a pthread program and every thread shows up as a process
in ps.  Of course that is on a system with a 2.4 kernel compatible
glibc, so that is probably not a valid test.  Running on 2.6.11 on an
amd64 with glibc compiled for 2.6 kernels only, I only see one pid for
the multithreaded program.
Doing kill on the threadid on the amd64 does return ESRCH.
Make sure your test is on a 2.6 kernel system with glibc compiled to
only use nptl (so not 2.4 kernel compatible at all).  It appears to work
as you want it to now.
