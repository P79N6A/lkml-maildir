As several people have told you, the SUSv3 section on fcntl and
deadlocks reads as follows:
        "A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a
        locked region is put to sleep by attempting to lock another
        process' locked region. If the system detects that sleeping
        until a locked region is unlocked would cause a deadlock,
        fcntl() shall fail with an [EDEADLK] error."
There is no mention there or anywhere else of a need to make exceptions
when dealing with threads. The posix locking model is _process_ based,
and so our deadlock detection only needs to take that into account.
If programmers choose to play tricksy little games with threads, then it
is their responsibility to ensure that the application doesn't get into
a situation where the posix deadlock detection model breaks down.
