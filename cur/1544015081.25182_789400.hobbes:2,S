That's good point, but not what I see in actual practice.  These zombie
systems don't seem to use the smtp gateway for their ranges, they send the
emails direct.  From my observations, most of these systems tend to stay
zombies, since almost all of them are windows systems.
I have discovered that by using this method to block them, once they open
a connection and I start dropping traffic while the connection is left
open it "tarpits" the bots and causes a cascade failure in the botnet
network for about 20 minutes until the systems start skipping the mail
server doing the bocking.
