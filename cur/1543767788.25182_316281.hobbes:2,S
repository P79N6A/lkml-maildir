It talks ATA command blocks but if you write an ATA command block parser
you can write yourself a remote device stack and the protocol is very
simple. For block storage NBD is probably simpler and more efficient but
AoE might be interesting for accessing embedded microcontrollers and the
like because you don't need a TCP/IP stack.
