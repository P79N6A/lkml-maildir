There is a fundamental problem in getting  a decent log to debug  a 
crashed kernel.  Maybe we should take a hint from Solaris.
If the kernel crashes Solaris dumps core to swap and sets a flag.
At the next boot this image is copied to /var/adm/crashdump where
it is preserved for future debugging. Obviously swap needs to be
larger than core, but this is usually the case.
On Sun machines this is fairly easy because the dump can be
performed by the OBP, on other architectures it may be more
difficult to still have enough working kernel to achieve the dump
after a kernel panic.
Just a thought .......
