Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Kbuild: index asm-$(SUBARCH) headers for UML
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/20/239

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
In Uml, many definitions are borrowed from underlying subarch headers
(with #include <asm/arch/stuff.h>). And it has become annoying to keep switching
tag files all time, so by default index the underlying subarch headers too. Btw,
it adds negligible space to the tags file (less than 1M surely, IIRC it was
around 500k over 40M).
Finally, preserve the ALLSOURCE_ARCHS command line option (I hope) - if it is
set, it is used for headers too as before. But check my construct please, I
didn't test this.
