We already have that "something": pci_enable_device().
The guest OS "Arch" code can then do the reassignment.
See "3.1 Enable the PCI device" in Documentation/pci.txt.

The Hypervisor could be responsible for making the right devices
visible to the appropriate partitions/guests by intercepting the
PCI bus walk and/or hotplug support. I don't think you
should need any dummy resource/drivers in the guest OS.
