the 'hugemem' kernel also has config_highpte defined which is a bit
redundant - that complexity one could avoid with the 4/4 split. Another
detail: the hugemem kernel also enables PAE, which adds another 2 usecs
to every syscall (!). So these performance numbers only hold if you are
running mysql on x86 using more than 4GB of RAM. (which, given mysql's
threaded design, doesnt make all that much of a sense.)
But no doubt, the 4/4 split is not for free. If a workload does lots of
high-frequency system-calls then the cost can be pretty high.
vsyscall-sys_gettimeofday and vsyscall-sys_time could help quite some
for mysql. Also, the highly threaded nature of mysql on the same MM
which is pretty much the worst-case for the 4/4 design. If it's an
issue, there are multiple ways to mitigate this cost.
but 4/4 is mostly a life-extender for the high end of the x86 platform -
which is dying fast. If i were to decide between some of the highly
intrusive architectural highmem solutions (which all revolve about the
concept of dynamically mapping back and forth) and the simplicity of
4/4, i'd go for 4/4 unless forced otherwise.
