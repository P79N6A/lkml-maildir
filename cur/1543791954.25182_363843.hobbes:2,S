Since then I have been tracking of what really fails in the bttv driver,
and running:   strace -o tvtime.log tvtime
Result is most revealing in failures.
The fault is not in I2C, but appears in   video_buf  module failing
calls of   get_user_pages()   with  -EFAULT.
There has been lots of discussion about it back in August, but apparently
only now in post 2.6.14 the changes made it into   mm/memory.c  which
faulted this thing for BTTV. 
Oh yes,  I do use Fedora Core development kernels, and don't usually
(anymore) compile things myself, but now I had a weekend off...
