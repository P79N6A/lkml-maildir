In 2.6 GPM does not have access to the hardware and therefore cannot reset
it. A temporary fix can be downloaded from here:
	
http://bugme.osdl.org/attachment.cgi?id=3244&action=view
It will for only on pre 2.6.9-rc2 kernels. When using kernels 2.6.9-rc3+
there is no automatic re-synchronization [yet] but one can restore a mouse
by issuing the following command:
	echo -n "reconnect" > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/driver
To find out which 'serioX' your mouse connected to just look into their
respective "driver" attributes - the one with "psmouse" is the one you
need.
