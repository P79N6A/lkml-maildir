It was the response to "pushing a bodge upstream", while we just try to
make things working. :)
We are fighting that broken firmware-loader model for years, but every
driver author seems to have its own idea how that should work in theory,
but they are not even willing to switch to the existing version that is
expected to work better.

In our development model, users of an interface are expected to improve
it, because nobody else really knows what's needed. That unfortunately
didn't happen so far.
We get this kind of conversation every few months since a few years now.
I wonder, if we will see code, or at least come up with a better idea
this time. :)
