It's no more experiemental than the rest of it, in fact all my testing
has been with _FULL option enabled right now. So I'd basically say it's
the recommended setting :-)

Not necessarily, the above is wrap safe.

Ditto, at least for this one I agree that readibility would be better

ifdefs.

Irk, where did that come from?! Had you done the incremental patches
this would not have slipped through! My mistake.

I had already rewritten it by the time your changed version was out, so
it was simply unchanged.

Just more readable that we are setting bit 2.

Sure, go ahead. And do the changes they way we discussed earlier today,
ok? :)
