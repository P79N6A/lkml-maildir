Developing a web front-end with the functionality of "make xconfig"
would be a pretty trivial project.  I would be great to have a webserver
that would
allow building custom kernels and archive the configurations that are
built.
Then, if a previously used configuration is selected via the web version
of xconfig, that already built kernel gets served up with no delay.
An e-mail notification of when new configurations are ready could be
sent
to the requestee.  The kernel could be packaged as either a RPM, debian
package or tar.bz2 file.  I guess we'd also serve up the modules and 
System.map files.  It would be important to be able to deliver matched
PCMCIA and sound driver modules, too.
Of course, this would be a major hardware investment.
One tool that might be helpful for converting MS Windows users would be
a system analysis tool that would gather the system hardware information
that could be used to drive the system request process.
Nutty idea or not?
Cheers,
