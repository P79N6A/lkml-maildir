	I'm not sure I get you here.  When I say hardsectsize, I mean
get_hardsectsize(dev), not super->s_blocksize.  On ext2, s_blocksize is
1k, 2k, or 4k.  Databases want to use O_DIRECT aligned at 512b.  This
can be done (again, see my patch), and I would think it necesary.
	If you meant that s_blocksize should match get_hardsectsize, I
agree.  If you meant the other way around, then consumers that want to
do O_DIRECT operations at 512b alingments won't be able to.
