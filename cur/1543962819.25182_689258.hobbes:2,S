Sam,
We have a case in powerpc in which we want to link some library  
routines with all module objects.  The routines are intended for  
handling out-of-line function call register save/restore so having  
them as EXPORT_SYMBOL() is counter productive (we do also need to link  
the same "library" code into the kernel).
Any suggestions on how to handle this?
thanks
