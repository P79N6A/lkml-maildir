Subject: [RFC][PATCH] schedule changes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/21/165

This patch against 2.3.39 makes the following changes, in random order:
* puts RT processes on a separate run queue.  This allows RT processes to be 
  scheduled without considering SCHED_OTHER processes and removes the test
  for RT processes from goodness();
* implements lazy counter recalculation by updating the counters of runnable
  processes only.  This fixes the race that could trigger recalculation on
  more than one CPU and can be particularly beneficial on machines with 100s
  of processes of which only a small percentage is runnable at any time.
* as a free byproduct of the above two changes it fixes the recalculation bug 
  that would change the counters on SCHED_RR processes.  Counter
  recalculation is a SCHED_OTHER thing, it shouldn't mess with SCHED_RR
  counters;
* sched_yield() works for RT processes and works better for SCHED_OTHER;
* sched_rr_get_interval() does something sensible;
* SCHED_FIFO processes get a very large time slice so they don't timeout
  several times a second;
* removes lastproc from task_struct (only used on the PPC port for a printk)
  and groups bitfields together;
* adds a special version of goodness for processes that are known to be
  current on some CPU.  Half the goodness() calls in reschedule_idle() are of 
  this type;
* fixes the bug that causes TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE|TASK_EXCLUSIVE processes to be 
  taken off the run queue even if they have pending signals;
* occasionally, a process that goes to sleep becomes runnable before it is
  completely descheduled.  For such processes the current scheduler runs
  reschedule_idle() twice, once in wake_up_process() and once in
  __schedule_tail().  Worse, both of these calls happen when the process is
  not really schedulable (has_cpu = 1), which may waste the resulting trips
  to schedule().  This patch eliminates the duplicate calls and changes
  __schedule_tail so it releases the process before calling
  reschedule_idle().  It doesn't address the problem with wake_up_process().
  A future patch will change the conditions under which a process can be
  selected to allow a CPU to choose a process before it is completely
  descheduled on another CPU;
* various code cleanups.
One final issue has to do with processes getting added to the front of a
runqueue.  This causes SCHED_FIFO processes to schedule LIFO rather than FIFO 
but changing it may not be appropriate for other processes (there are
temporal affinity issues).  I left the existing behavior with the
understanding that it is incorrect for SCHED_FIFO.
 
Opinions, comments, suggestions welcome.
