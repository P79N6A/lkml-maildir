Hi,
I'm trying to get 2.5.42 to build on ARM, and I've finally run out of
ideas for things to try to get arch/arm/boot/Makefile and
arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile to work correctly.
What I'm seeing is:
/home/rmk/bin/arm-linux-ld -p -X -T vmlinux.lds head.o misc.o piggy.o /home/rmk/arm-linux/lib/gcc-lib/arm-linux/2.95.3/libgcc.a -o vmlinux
/home/rmk/bin/arm-linux-ld:vmlinux.lds:14: parse error
make[2]: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
make[1]: *** [compressed/vmlinux] Error 2
make: *** [zImage] Error 2
This appears to be because ZRELADDR is not passed from arch/arm/boot/Makefile
to arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile.  You may think this is fairly trivial
to fix, just export it.  However, it is already exported with a bunch of
other symbols.  Other symbols seem to make it through to compressed/Makefile
though.
I've tried many things, like including $(TOPDIR) Rules.make at the top of
arch/arm/boot/Makefile, but this doesn't seem to make any difference what
so ever.
Help!
Unless this can be solved, I'm going to be pushing _compile only_ tested
stuff to Linus in the forthcoming weeks until someone can provide some
hints as to what and why this broke.
