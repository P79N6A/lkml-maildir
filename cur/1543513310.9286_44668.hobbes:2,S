Subject: Bug with IP forwarding on dummy interface ?

While doing some experiments on IP forwarding, I found a strange
behavior when you forward packets coming from ethernet interface 
to the dummy network interface.
It seems that ip-forwarding continues after you disabled 
the dummy interface. The corresponding ip address is still
ping-able or even telnet-able. Here are the details.
I am using kernel 2.2.12 with no firewall code included in
the kernel (see at the end for the exact config.)
Here is the configuration. I have to physical hosts, myhost (one
ethernet interface) and myrouter (one eth, one eth alias and
one dummy) with the following configuration:
                 ADRESS         NETWORK       NETMASK        BROADCAST
myhost   eth0    152.81.4.137   152.81.0.0    255.255.240.0  152.81.15.255
myrouter eth0    152.81.65.19   152.81.64.0   255.255.240.0  152.81.79.255
         eth0:0  152.81.11.173  152.81.0.0    255.255.240.0  152.81.15.255
         dummy0  192.168.65.1   192.168.64.0  255.255.240.0  192.168.79.255
myhost should be able to reach the dummy interface of myrouter. A
typical test could be telnet 192.168.65.1. For this, the eth0:0 
interface of myrouter is configured as a gateway for the dummy
network. Here is the routing table of myhost
[root@myhost]# /sbin/route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
152.81.4.137    *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 eth0
152.81.64.0     *               255.255.240.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
192.168.64.0    152.81.11.173   255.255.240.0   UG    0      0        0 eth0
loopback-net    *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
default         152.81.1.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
myrouter should forward packets coming from myhost on its eth0:0 interface
to its dummy0 interface. Here is the routing table of myrouter
[root@myrouter]# /sbin/route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.65.1    *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 dummy0
152.81.65.19    *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 eth0
152.81.11.173   *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 eth0
152.81.64.0     *               255.255.240.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
192.168.64.0    *               255.255.240.0   U     0      0        0 dummy0
152.81.64.0     *               255.255.240.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
loopback-net    *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
default         152.81.1.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
Now if ip_forward is set, everything is ok and I can telnet 192.168.65.1
on myhost.
[root@myhost]# telnet 192.168.65.1
Trying 192.168.65.1...
Connected to myrouter.loria.fr.
Escape character is '^]'.
.....
But then if I remove the dummy0 interface by
   
    /sbin/ifconfig dummy0 down 
for example, I should not be able to telnet 192.168.65.1 anymore ? 
Or it still works ! Moreover, I can remove the dummy.o module by
/sbin/rmmod dummy
while a telnet session is active. The session freezes at that 
point. So dummy.o was in use but not marked as such ?
I do not know what happens in the kernel but it seems to
me that this is not a good behavior.
Thanks in advance for any explanation. As I am not
on the list, please CC any answer to larchey@loria.fr.
