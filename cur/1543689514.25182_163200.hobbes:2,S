The other flags are __GFP_WAIT, __GFP_HIGH, __GFP_IO, __GFP_HIGHIO, and
__GFP_FS (flags == 0x1f0).
So this must be something else's wrong.  I was using madwifi Atheros
driver.
Thank you very much,
Henry

Hi Henry,

Which flags were set? __GFP_WAIT must not be set [i.e. will panic], the 
other combinations are invalid. The only legal values for the flags 
variable are 0 or SLAB_ATOMIC [aka GFP_ATOMIC, aka __GFP_HIGH].

No, it's wrong. Your driver will panic once in a while, especially under
memory intensive stress tests.
