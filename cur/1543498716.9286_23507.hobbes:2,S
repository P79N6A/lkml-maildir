I had this booting problem too. My specs are:
SuSE 6.1 (mostly unchanged),
egcs-2.91.66, binutils 2.9.1.0.22,
glibc 2.0.7pre6 on an i686 system.
2.3.5 worked ok, but with 2.3.6 i had this problem.
However this patch helped me. It compiled ok and the problem was 
fixed.
The only thing i noticed was an error message during the end of the 
kernel boot sequence, which i have never seen before:
kmem_grow: called nonatomically from int - size-32
If anybody wants to know more, please mail me.
