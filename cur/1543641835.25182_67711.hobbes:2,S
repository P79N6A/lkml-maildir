Subject: Benchmarks for performance patches (-ck) for 2.4.19

My merged patchset (
http://kernel.kolivas.net
) was designed to improve system
responsiveness. I have yet to find a good benchmark that measures such a thing.
However, in response to criticism about not providing benchmarks I have made
available some standard benchmarks at the excellent resources of the open source
development laboratory scalable test platform. They are available here:
http://www.osdl.org/stp
my patchsets are the following:
-ck5 patch is patch #781
-ck5-rmap is #782
-ck5-ll is #783
I have conducted some basic tests on #781 and the numbers show it is at least
equivalent to stock 2.4.19 (#747), although as I said none of these benchmarks
are designed to test desktop system responsiveness.
Please feel free to conduct any tests you like on these patches. I would be
interested to hear if anyone can suggest the most suitable benchmark. Please cc
me to ensure I receive any comments.
