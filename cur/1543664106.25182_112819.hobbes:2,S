Subject: holding kernel semaphores while in userspace ...

I've two processes that both read/write a shared resource (read via mmap,
write via write) that my device driver controls...
Now I know I could use SYSV semaphores and a shared mem region to
implement read/write semaphores but this seems to me to be a bit
heavyweight - I know I probably want futexes also (but this is 2.4 and I
probably wouldn't get that patch past the people here..)
So I was wondering if I added a couple of ioctls to my driver to wrap
access to a rwsem in the kernel, so four ioctls doing read/write up/down
combinations (are there interruptible versions for rwsems??), or is what
I'm doing stupid and evil .. and should I just be happy with my SYSV
semaphores or just use futexes (do these work acroess processes??)
Dave.
