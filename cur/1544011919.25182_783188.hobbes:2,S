I will bisect as time permits, but may be it rings the bell for someone. 
2.6.28-rc7 is OK; rc9 switches console off and never goes in suspend. 
Power remains on, keyboard is non-functional and the only way out is 
power button. I have not tried rc8.
If somebody has soggestions what to (try to) revert, it would be great 
and save quite a bit of time for bisecting.
