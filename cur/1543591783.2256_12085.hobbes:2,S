The IOMMU code allocation strategy is designed to fail due to
fragmentation as everything that performs contiguous allocations of
variable quantities.
I may add a test of pci_map_* return code in the sym53c8xx driver, but
the driver will panic on failure. It is not acceptable to consider such
kind of failure as a normal situation (returning some ?_BUSY status to
the SCSI driver) for the following reasons:
- IOs may be reordered and break upper layers assumptions.
- Spurious errors and even BUS resets may happen.
For now, driver methods that are requested to queue IOs are not allowed to
wait for resources. Anyway, the pci_map_* interface is unable to wait.
There are obviously ways to deal gracefully with such resource lack, but
the current SCSI layer isn't featured for that. For example, a
freeze/unfreeze mechanism as described in CAM can be implemented in order
not to reorder IOs, and some mechanism (callback, resource wait, etc...)
must be added to restart the operation when resource is likely to be
available.
IMO, the only acceptable fix in the current kernel is to perform IOMMU PTE
allocations of a fixed quantity at a time, as limiting SG entry to fit in
a single PAGE for example.

PS: May-be I should look how *BSD's handles IOMMUs.
