I have already volunteered to email the press release out to UK
publications.
I have got email addresses for some of:
*	the UK computing press
*	the UK national daily newspapers
I didn't think about the economist, new scientist, BBC & ITN, but
someone mentioned them so I'll try to find something.
If anybody has suitable (email) addresses for UK pubs please forward
them to me (it is easier to reject duplicates than dig out new ones).

Probably best done by country.
I'm worried about doing the UK as I'm not always in. Anybody else ?
