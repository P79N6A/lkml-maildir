gcc will not warn about unused function arguments - only about unused 
local variables. The 'unused' argument should either be removed 
altogether, or replaced with a properly named parameter and a check 
returning -ENOSYS if the argument is not zero (or something like that). 
(It's generally better to keep such syscalls extensible via such trivial 
means, if there's a remote chance for ever needing to extend that 
syscall.)
