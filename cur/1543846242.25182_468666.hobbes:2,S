	I'm sorry, but as there is no longer any "devel" serie, to me
there is no longer any "stable" serie. Do you mean that we are going
to get frozen with the same APIs until then end of time ? I don't

	You can see the glass half-full or half-empty. Maybe you can
see that both Wireless Tools and wpa_supplicant compatible with those
changes were released last May, which means by the time this kernel
change hit the distro, people won't notice...
