The ioctl is SIOCGIWNAME, which is used by iwconfig from the wireless-tools
package to check if a given net dev is a wireless thing or not (called from
ifup in RedHat as a type test on the net dev).
Unfortunately, include/linux/wireless.h has a big pile of ioctls and arg/res
types that would need to be checked, so I'll defer this to Jean Tourrilhes (cc:d).
