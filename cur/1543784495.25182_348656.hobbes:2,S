Before we had "default m", since that is how a distro
is expected to compile this, and other, "ACPI drivers".
But we got complaits that _nothing_ should be "default m",
so I changed it to "default y".  Maybe that was simplistic --
button should be "default y", but the platform drivers should
all be "default n"?
I'm not sure what to do here -- what use-model
should we tune default Kconfig for?
thanks,
