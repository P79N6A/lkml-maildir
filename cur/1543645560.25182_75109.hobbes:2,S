John,
***** Please BCC me in on any reply, not CC me.
Two reasons, I am not on the Mailing List,
and second I am suffering BIG time with SPAM
from posting to mailing lists/Newsgroups.
Instructions on real address at bottom.
Thanks in advance. *****
I am serious.  If you cannot respect that wish then so be it.  Do you
think anyone willing to make an offer of time and effort such as I
have would make light of this?  The fact you have made the effort to
decompose the eMail address demonstrates the fact it can be done and
not that much effort.  It is not like I am posting with no valid eMail
address or without indicating what my real eMail address is.  What I
have done is not that much different that other people have done when
posting to the LKML.  I have just made it difficult for eMail bots to
harvest my eMail address but deleting/changing the .at., at, NOSPAM,
extra levels in domain addresses, etc items that others use to effect
the same result. 
If it was not for the experiences I have already had with SPAM to the
LKML I be more than happy to include my real eMail address in my eMail
headers.  It was in fact that I did that has me being hit by all sorts
of SPAM.  Please do not tell me all about the tools to delete SPAM.  I
know of some, and many I cannot use for various reasons, mostly to do
with turning back eMail I need to receive.
I was not aware you spoke on behalf of Linus. 
If you feel I am sending "junk mail" then I kindly suggest you report
that to your ISP, my ISP and other reporting authorities.  Let them
determine if my posting is against AUP of internet and providers.  Oh
yes, of course people who send "junk mail" have and use a GPG key,
that is on the keyserver as well!

Please BCC me by replacing after the "@" as follows:
TLD =         The last three letters of the word "internet"
Domain name = The first three letters of the word "theory",
              followed by the first three letters of the word
              "offsite", followed by the first three letters
              of the country "Iceland".
My appologies in advance for the jumbled eMail address
and request to BCC me, but SPAM has become a very serious
problem.  The eMail address in my header information is
not a valid eMail address for me.  I needed to use a valid
domain due to ISP SMTP screen rules.
Please note: You may experience delays in my replies.  I will
             reply.
             This is due to major restoration activity to my riser
             section of the building.
             My internet access will be limited to a couple weekday
             evenings.  Weekend access will be a bit better but
             limited as an indirect consequence of the restoration
             work.
             If for any reason you need a more immediate reply or
             fail to receive a reply, please phone and leave a
             message.  If you do leave a phone message, please note
             that I may not be able to hear the message and/or
             reply until the evening.  This will be due to the
             extensive noise levels of the restoration work
             activity drowning out most other volume levels of
             sound.
             The work starts 22 July 2002.  Based on similar
             experience to other sections of the building I would
             estimate the major noise element of the work to be
             about 4+ weeks for my riser.  There will be secondary
             instances once other ajacent riser sections are done
             that will have a similar impact, but for lessor
             periods of time.
             My appologies in advance, but this is mandated work
             that must be done.
