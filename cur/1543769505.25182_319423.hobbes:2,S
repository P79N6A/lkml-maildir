 If that is the case, then that's a bug in that C library, which should be 
reported and fixed.  When starting a program, i.e. as a result of 
execve(), Linux passes the current page size in use in the auxiliary 
vector.  That value should be retrieved and used by a C library for 
platforms that support various page sizes and returned by library calls 
like getconf().  For example glibc gets it right.
