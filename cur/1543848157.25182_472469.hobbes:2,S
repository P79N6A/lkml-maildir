Actually, filemap_xip needs some attention I think... if xip files
can be truncated or invalidated (I assume they can), then we need to
lock the page, validate that it is the correct one and not truncated,
and return with it locked.
That should be as simple as just locking the page and rechecking i_size,
but maybe the zero page can be handled better... I don't know?
