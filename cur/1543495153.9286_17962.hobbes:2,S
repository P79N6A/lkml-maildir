Sometimes, like about once a week diald completely hangs my computer in
the midst of dialing, syslog looks something like this:
May  8 00:14:24 localhost chat[8230]: expect (ogin)
May  8 00:14:24 localhost chat[8230]: ^M
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@....
the last line repeats to 2857 bytes.
I sometimes see simular things when connecting and it goes along fine, it
never crashes soon after bootup.
Then there's a syslog restart from when I reboot the thing. I think I've
tried sysrq + i and the like but that didn't do anything. How do I debug
this problem?
My configuration:
Linux broadsword 2.2.7 #1 SMP Sun May 2 15:12:09 PDT 1999 i686 unknown
motherboard intel PR440FX or reasonable simulcrum of thereof in an old
Toshiba equim. 2 pentium pro 166 512s, running at 200mhz. MB has built in
eepro100 and crystal chipset.
Debian (with unstable stuff mostly).
/lib/libc-2.1.1.so
diald version 0.16.5-3
Please CC me any replies as I'm not subscribed to the list.
TIA
