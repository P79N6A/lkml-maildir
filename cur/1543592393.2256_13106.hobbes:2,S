There can be more bugs of course, two patches I posted are only meant to
fix deadlocks in the allocation fail path of alloc_bounces() and the
second patch in getblk() allocation fail path, nothing more. Those are
strictly necessary fixes as far I can tell, and their implementation was
quite obviously right to my eyes.
Now if you send some debugging info with deadlocks you gets with 2.4.5
vanilla I will be certainly interested to found their source. Also Rik
just said to have a fix for other bugs in that area, I didn't checked
that part.
What I can say is that with my tree I didn't reproduced deadlocks
highmem related with cerberus but I'm using highmem emulation not real
highmem.
