Yep. This is meant to be useful precisely for things like making cpusets
partition the domains properly or ensuring a system's topology is built
correctly.

I'll concede that point. It would probably be useful for a sysadmin to be
able to look at how they can better make cpuset placements such that they
get the best partitioning.
I would still prefer not to say "use an exclusive domain for this cpuset".
cpusets should be able to do the optimal thing with the data it has, so
this is one less complication to deal with.
