You are out of big physically contigious blobs of memory under 16MBs for
DMA buffers. You can put in dmabuf=1 as an option to sound.o or set a
config param at compile time if you dont use modules.
Anyone know how difficult a hack it would be to add the ability to rope
off 1meg or so of <16MB ram for such buffers at boot time?
