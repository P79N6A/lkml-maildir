I can get it to occur 100% of the time as well. I chalked it up to some
ncurses weirdness since sometimes when I would go into menus, it would
automagically move my cursor down a couple of lines and then cause the
redraws to freak out. Very odd.
My system is Debian 2.0 (hamm), all up to date (just checked :)
