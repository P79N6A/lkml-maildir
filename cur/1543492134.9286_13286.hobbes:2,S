This is absurd.  To begin with, software package formats are completely
off-topic, and I just received 5 messages from you in a row on this list
about them.  Second, I would like to note that you are comparing an int
and a pointer here -- .tar.gz is no more a software package format than
.rpm is a general purpose way to archive your files.  Just as it is up to
the author to decide the license it is up to her to choose the
distribution format.  Be grateful it isn't something obscure, and you have
the software to begin with.  If you've got a problem with it, volunteer to
repackage new releases, or write your own software so you can decide what
fancy packaging to use, but whatever you do, don't tell us about it.
