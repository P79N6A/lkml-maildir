I didn't say that. I was just commenting that symlinks are easy to
abuse (certainly in today's world they're often used instead of hard
links without good reason, and since they "break" when you move their target
a hard link is often a better choice).
Ending up with a recursive problem solution isn't inherently bad, but
if that form of solution leads to winding down a limit to something
silly then that's a clue that in this instance another solution is
probably worth seeking.
