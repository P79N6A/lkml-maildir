Well this really depends on how privileged a certain root user (think of 
SELinux and others) is.

My one half says no. But it needs reworking. Just look what I had to do 
with the linux source code in order to get this

And my other half says yes, because it's ironically to give a user all caps 
and then limit a certain user's permissions using LSM hook functions. So in 
effect, if you wanted root accounts of varying powers, all of them would need 
some - or even all - caps so that the code flow can reach the security_*() 
functions at all, because capable() is done before security_*(). So to get to 
security_*(), caps must be enabled, which turns a
	if(!capable(CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE)) return;
into, effectively,
	if(0) return;
With regard to _this_, I think it would be best to kill the cap checks, and 
let a security_* function handle it, in the style of "security/traditional.c".
