Ok, so function pointer to allocate resources and associate with the
device? You can't just allocate memory for resources structure, you
need to populate it with data if you want it to be used by a driver
immediately after registration... And have actually release all
resources, not only memory? It is getting beyond the "*_simple"
approach though.
Or do I still misunderstand you?
