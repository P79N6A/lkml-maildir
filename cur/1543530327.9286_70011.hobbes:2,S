/ANOTHER SOAPBOX ON/
I have been following and using Donald's tulip.c for MANY YEARS...

I totally agree with Jim Morris.  Let's stop the wasteful
complaining!!!!  I'll bet most of us are tired hearing it!

Donald has worked hard to maintain a driver for "tulip", while, in fact,
there is NO "tulip" standard.  Manufacturers have changed the guts of
the original "tulip" design in a willy-nilly fashion - without warning
(no new board/card designation changes).  Donald has "busted his rump"
to keep up with all the changes - and simultaneously improve performance
of the driver.
Have there been problems, you bet.  But Donald has responded over the
years as best as one could expect.  Could he use a hand?  Of course. 
How about working together instead of this ridiculous, undermining
criticism!
