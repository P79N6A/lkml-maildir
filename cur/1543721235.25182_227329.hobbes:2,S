You missed my point.
How does a user know which format they need to build the kernel with
_if_ the kernel configuration contains all the formats and the boot
loader documentation fails to mention it?
Sure you can document each format in minute detail, but that doesn't
tell the user anything useful.
As I tried to point out, boot loaders on ARM historically seem to have
been "My First ARM Project" type things so there's lots of them out
there - there aren't 3 or so found on x86.
AFAIAC, if the boot loader does not support the standard Image or
zImage format, both of which are the fully documented "official"
ARM kernel formats, it is up to the boot loader to provide whatever
scripts or programs are needed to manipulate the output of the kernel
build to whatever the boot loader wants.
