Yes, 100 bonus points for that one!  That is true, Windows telnet
is very brain damaged.  Microsoft started out with BSD source,
and couldn't even invest enough time to get it to work properly
in Windows at all.  You'd think that they'd have done better
having lifted BSD source code to start with.  Same for ftp too...
