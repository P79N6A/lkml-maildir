So what is your suggestion to get the working funktionality
from kernel 2.6.16 back ? 2.6.17 have broken it.
Sure, using Apples legacy support for EFI is a method to
boot linux on the Intel Macs, but not the native way. It depends
on how good their legacy emulation is and if they implement it
in future products. They could also decide to drop it.
