It *does* signal a fault, in the form of a machine check.  On other
architectures I'm familiar with this is usually implemented as an
interrupt, but the idea is similar - when the system bus controller
detects a bad address on the bus, it returns all 1s (for a read) and
signals an interrupt.  Usually you can turn this interrupt off (and
most likely you can on Itanium chipsets too) but that is not a good
idea.
The problem is that this interrupt is not synchronous with respect to
the instruction stream, and this makes it difficult for software to
recover from, particularly in a monolithic system like Linux where you
can't just terminate the faulting driver.  The best you can usually do
is to print the details and hope that it's a once-off.  It is not
something that you can sensibly use to abort copy_*_user.
In any case touching random addresses is just plain bad.  What if
there's a device mapped there which happens to have read side effects
like clearing the interrupt cause, so e.g. every time you read /dev/mem
you cause a timeout on your SCSI bus :)
