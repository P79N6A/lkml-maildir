[sorry for the incomplete mail, below is the complete one: ]
Your .config works for me with 2.4.24 (without grsecurity).
Please you doublecheck whether the following really fails for you:
  cd linux-2.4.24
  mv .config /tmp
  cd ..
  rm -rf linux-2.4.24
  tar xzf linux-2.4.24.tar.gz
  cd linux-2.4.24
  mv /tmp/.config .
  make oldconfig
  make dep
  make bzImage
  make modules
  make modules_install
TIA
Adrian
