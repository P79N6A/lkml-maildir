Well, I finally managed to check, and both CPUs are at 76C - sounds
quite hot to me. Is that problematic? I've never run these Athlons
before, so I'm not sure what's supposed to be normal ;-)
Going back to kernel issues - I tried the Red Hat enterprise kernel
(2.4.9-13), but that's no go either. Basically, the summary is:
  - Red Hat Kernel (any) boots fine, hangs at login prompt
  - Red Hat Kernel SINGLE USER runs fine and lets me hack around
  - Custom kernel (2.4.15-pre4 SMP) hangs due to failing to
    mount the root partition (initrd issue I think)
I have experienced the "hanging at login prompt" issue before - with
good old Red Hat 7.0. That was solved by upgrading the broken gcc and
broken glibc, and didn't even appear to be a kernel issue.
Cheers
