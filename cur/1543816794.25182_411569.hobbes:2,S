I made no commont on what "they" might want, I want to make the rack of 
underutilized Windows, BSD and Solaris servers go away. An approach 
which doesn't support unmodified guest installs doesn't solve any of my 
current problems. I didn't say it was in any way not useful, just not of 
interest to me. What needs I have for Linux environments are answered by 
jails and/or UML.
