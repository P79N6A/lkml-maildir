Until it's fixed. Until then I'm considering it a byproduct of that same
development. And with your report, that makes it two architectures, not
one.
The concepts of the features etc. are all generally okay, though very
buzzword-centric. In general the audits and sweeps have been lacking
thoroughness in the architecture-specific areas. I expect that
particular issue to have been the cause of these two bugreports.
