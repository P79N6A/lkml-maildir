Hello Haavard,
A few remarks:

My name, at your address ;-)))
> This patch splits up the interrupt handler of the serial port
> into a interrupt top-half and a tasklet.
I see you moved the handling of the sysrq-key to the tasklet. This was
actually a very nice feature in the IRQ-top half on preempt-RT. This
helps debugging running away RT-processes.

Preempt-RT now absolutely requires my (4th) IRQ_NODELAY patch, because
the spinlock now is always inside the code, and not only in
theexception path, and thus without my NO_DELAY patch we have a panic
during boot.
On preempt-RT this spinlock must be a raw-spinlock. (If this type is
known in the mainline kernel, you can apply that patch it anyway)
BTW: Attached I have added a 2nd patch that I use for Preempt-RT. (For
cleaner startup, and to get rid of useless IRQ-threads.
> This patch should apply on top of the cleanup patch I sent earlier
For the cleanup patch:
Acked-by: Remy Bohmer <linux@bohmer.net>

So, for this patch: I am almost happy ;-)
Kind Regards,
Remy
This patch prevents starting up a useless IRQ-thread for IRQ-1,
because this IRQ is running in IRQF_NODELAY context due to the 
timer interrupt.
