	The problem is not in the kernels. It is more likely
a virus.
[ -f /dev/hdx1 ] && echo "Then you should panic."
	Of course, it can be another "problem" with the

	Yes, one process simply opens af_packet socket and
eats and eats... Check with ifconfig for promisc mode. "ls" is
the infected executable which is first started. Sort of. If
the above is true just stop this box, you are victim.
