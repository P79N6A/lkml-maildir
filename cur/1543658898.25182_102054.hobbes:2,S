Subject: BLKBSZSET still not working on 2.4.18 ? [rescued]

I'm trying to backup a partition on an IDE drive which has an odd number 
of sectors (204939). With a stock open/read you cannot access the last 
sector, and that why I tried the BLKBSZSET ioctl to set the basic read 
block size to 512 bytes. I verified the writen value with BLKBSZGET 
ioctl, but I still cannot read this last sector !
I've tried also this:
- FreeBSD : works but it don't want to port all my software to it
- raw devices: can't read the last sector:
# raw  /dev/raw1 /dev/hda2
# dd if=/dev/raw1 of=C bs=512
dd: reading `/dev/raw1': No such device or address
204938+0 records in
204938+0 records out
What can it do ? Wait for a patch in 2.5.xxx ?
TIA,
    Ludovic Drolez.
