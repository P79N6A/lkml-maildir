My case (SH-4) is: virtual address indexed, physical address tagged cache
(which has alias issue).
Suppose there's I/O to the physical page P asynchronously, and the
page is placed in the swap cache.  It remains cache entry, say,
indexed kernel virtual address K.  Then, process maps P at U.  U and K
(may) indexes differently.  The process will get the data from memory
(not the one in the cashe), if it's not flushed.
