The IRQ number is a cookie. Linux knows that on x86 ISA IRQ is mapped
0-15 and the ISA drivers sometimes know about this stuff too. What
exception number comes back off the processor and what function you call
is really quite unrelated. So request/free_irq functionality in the i386
layer can happily remap the irqs back and forth so ISA comes 0-15, and
keep the drivers and core oblivious to this.

Internal detail - doesnt matter for how you number IRQ's outside of your
arch/i386/kernel internal bits

ACPI is basically PC specific gunge. Drivers don't and should not know
about it.

Linux doesn't touch the PCI interrupt line values or really care about
them, so thats trivial to do.

No because any ACPI ISA redirect must be done portably, so used to keep
the ISA irq's logically 0-15 on x86

I understand why it was done - I think its the wrong abstraction as it
pushes too much board knowledge into drivers and into places that make
assumptions about ISA (a legacy of Linux original design being for ISA
PC)
