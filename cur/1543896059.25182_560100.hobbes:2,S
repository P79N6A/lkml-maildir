One of thousands, no doubt.

In the US only, and it was easily available for free if people didn't
care about violating patents or you could buy Stronghold from
Covalent. And plenty of folks didn't need encryption or did without it
even if they did.

You're preaching to the choir about Linux quality. I started using it
in 1997 (to run Apache, on a cast-off i486sx w/ 8 MB ram IIRC), and it
was years before I ever had it crash on me.
My point was about perceptions, not quality -- not that Linux wasn't
good, but that it was not widely considered to be "enterprise class."
For certain uses, Apache was, in a way that was fairly novel for Free
Software.
Anyway, it was also meant to be somewhat tongue-in-cheek (what's the
emoticon for a tongue in a cheek?) -- anyone who thinks they know the
_one_ reason Linux was successful is on crack (well, it might have
been Linus' accent).
