  Doesn't the following already work "ide2=0 ide3=0 ...." for the 
promise binary driver?

  This is getting really complex.  Weren't we trying to make things 
simple?  The simple solution is to have the single option, and let user 
space (initrd) determine if you want to load the pdcraid driver.

  No you really have only 2 options.
1)Let linux see the ide controller.
2)Don't then linux see the ide controller.
#1 Will only see ataraid partitions if there exists a promise raid 
configuration, and the pdcraid driver is loaded.

  Yes unless you insert the pdcraid module.  Linux will only see the raw 
drives.  Once you insert pdcraid you can see the raid devices, and raw 
disks.  Which can cause major issues at times.
