Obviously.
That doesn't stop the Linux kernel and device-mapper from presenting
usable numbers to user space tools.
What are "usable numbers"?
The only usable numbers are the exact ones that the BIOS uses, because
they are the only CHS numbers that have a purpose:
The purpose of those numbers is backwards compatibility with DOS and
Windows.  Stuff like PartitionMagic, FreeDOS, odd boot loaders
(including Windows XP's), weird implementations of fdisk, etc.
And that's the reason that the kernel and device mapper should either
represent the numbers that the BIOS currently uses, or nothing at all.
Fair'n'square..

The statement that "any value is gibberish" is plain wrong, since the
BIOS translations are useful values under some circumstances.
In cases where it does make sense, you want a consistent and well
maintained method of matching BIOS drives to devices and reporting
BIOS numbers.
In cases where it does not make sense, you just want to return error
and let the app handle it.

LILO is already fit for fight if you use the right flag.
Good idea to fix GRUB.
The GRUB code does look like a mess to me, though.
An ETA on GRUB2 would be nice, or an alternate source tree where
people could improve on the existing GRUB..

If you rip all CHS out of the kernel right now, user space tools has
to make guesses when mucking with partition tables.  Any attempts to
make Linux <whatever>fdisk compatible with other fdisk's will be
futile.  Stuff like for example placing a partition on a (virtual)
cylinder boundary is going to break when Linux <whatever>fdisk
translates LBA to CHS in one way (since the kernel doesn't provide a
meaningful value) and your BIOS does it another.

Ok, the better approach might be to destroy HDIO_GETGEO entirely and
tell userspace apps to use /sys/firmware/edd/int13_dev instead.  It
provides for a cleaner implementation.
But then again, that breaks compatibility with current tools.
A good way to get the ball rolling could be if we could all agree that
there are a number of tools that need the BIOS CHS numbers.  Then we
can decide where the universal logic that attempts to guess which
devices are which should go.  Then a proper implementation could be
discussed and conjured, and dmraid, <whatever>fdisk, perhaps LILO/GRUB
etc. could be made dependant on it.  And THEN the HDIO_GETGEO could be
ripped...
Anyway, just a personal idea, your concept of completely nuking CHS
from the kernel right now might be acceptable as well.
