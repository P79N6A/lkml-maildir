May I add a clarification?  Jamie has focussed on the set_page_dirty
in page_remove_rmap: that's a special for s390, on everything else the
"page_test_and_clear_dirty" preceding it evaluates to 0.  For most
arches it is indeed the set_page_dirty actually in zap_pte_range
which smears the dirt from pte to page.  (Please don't ask me
to explain the s390 case, I'm no expert.)
