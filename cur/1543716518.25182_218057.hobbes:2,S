Thanks Willy.  I like to automatic looping of Randy's patch (I had it working
nicely on a 2.4.18 kernel) because I don't have to set a time in case one
machine takes longer than another.
So far, however, I haven't got Randy's patch working for a newer kernel, so I
may try yours.
Would I only have to run make in the directory where I'm patching the file, then
make bzImage, make modules_install, and make install from the top level to apply
your patch?  Compiling all of my modules takes a long time, with random lock-ups
during compile gumming up the works as well. :-/  Any tips appreciated.
Thanks.
Bill
