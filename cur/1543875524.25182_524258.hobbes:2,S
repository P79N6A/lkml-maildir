Yes thank you. I386 is not my field, I have no interest per se in 
improving i386 performance and without your help I would have to drop this 
and keep the special casing in SLUB for i386. Generic tlb.h changes may 
also help to introduce quicklists to x86_64. The current quicklist patches 
can only work on higher levels due to the freeing of ptes via 
tlb_remove_page().
