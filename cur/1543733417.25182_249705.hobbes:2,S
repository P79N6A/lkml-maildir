I seriously doubt this is doable. Unless you put the whole driver in the 
kernel, which of course nobody wants. I frequently caused gpu lockups by 
experimental driver changes (for instance, wrong vertex setup). I think 
the consensus was that it's ok for the driver to lock up the gpu, but it 
should not lock up the kernel.
It might be possible to prevent lockups by a watchdog, resetting the gpu 
if a lockup is detected. This is how ATI deals with lockups in windows 
(dubbed "VPU Recover"), and there is a patch floating around for DRI too 
(though it is not exactly for that, and doesn't always work).
