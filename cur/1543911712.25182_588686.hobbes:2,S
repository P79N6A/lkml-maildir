Actually, os_print_error() (or some other interface to perror()) should be 
reintroduced and used more for error messages (and also strsignal() should 
be, for "Kernel mode signal N"). Problem debugging is hard, but there is no 
reason make it harder (or rather, not to simplify it for users).
Btw, the inlined abs() call is not very nice; on the other hand, it's a simple 
solution to make it robust, and we do not to be extra-optimal on these debug 
code paths.
