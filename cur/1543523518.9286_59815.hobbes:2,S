: What do You think about ?
I think that you don't listen, that's what I think.  It was quite
clear to me and others that I asked for a comparison between a system
that simulated the rendering your way and a system that simulated the
rendering as a group of unrelated processes.
Instead, you are jumping up and down about how wonderful your patch is
for a completely silly benchmark that HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO ANY REAL
WORLD APPLICATION.
