Ditto. Also an ALi here. I traced it through (printk debugging) and
it appears to lock up in the call to schedule() in rtc_read().
(2.4.21)
Has happened since about 2.4.21-pre3'ish. Haven't had time yet to
establish exactly which release (or ACPI release) started it.
A quirkier but similar bug - this laptop would freeze when writing
to the hardware clock *IF* there was a CD-ROM in the drive (IDE).
This freeze also seemed to occur at midnight most nights. Ejecting
the CD-ROM before saving the hwclock and also at 11:59pm disabled
the problem. This problem existed even without ACPI.
Bernard.
