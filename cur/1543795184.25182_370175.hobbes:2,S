NO.
There is not a _single_ compiler that is multi-threaded, and I'd argue 
that there probably never will be. It's pointless.
There's a _lot_ of really performance-sensitive stuff that will NEVER EVER 
be threaded. You may run a hundred copies of them at the same time, but 
every single copy will be single-threaded.
And this will optimize that case in a BIG way.
This is _not_ about "CPU hotplug". This is _not_ about "threaded apps 
before they are threaded". This is all about the fact that serious 
computation is done single-threaded, and anybody who thinks that 
single-threading is going away is so totally out to lunch that it's not 
even fun.
And yes, Sun will die. Single-thread performance matters a hell of a lot, 
and any company that bets that it doesn't, is a failure.
