On my system,
sudo cdrecord -scanbus ; \
sudo cdrecord -scanbus dev=ATA:
finds all devices that talk ATAPI, SCSI, MMC.

1a The question is rather, what is the reason that you claim libscg is
allegedly unable to find all devices?
  1b Not scanning all of the devices perhaps?
  1c Not asking the right enumeration interface perhaps?
2 And what devices are actually missing?
Name tangible devices or groups, not phantoms that no-one uses.
3 Why does libscg need to care at all which kernel driver provides SG_IO?
The device node give access to the target the user desires. Add serial
number listing to -scanbus to make those happy that have several drives
of the same brand and model.
4 Why have you not yet responded to the suggestion to use freedesktop.org
HAL to enumerate devices?
Summarizing past discussions, it appears as though you have not
presented sufficiently substantiated arguments to prove libscg is
actually missing out on device, and not sufficient evidence to convince
kernel developers to CHANGE things.
The same way as you want them to justify their using device nodes
instead bus:id:lun to map everything into a narrow namespace, they can
make you justify your request. Fact is that cdrecord+libscg appear to
work well enough so that nobody wants to care about theoretical gaps
that have no practical impact.
And given that libscg's namespace is already transport:bus:id:lun which
comprises /dev/hd* and /dev/sg* so nicely that CD writing works today,
it seems hard to justify changes beyond 1. removing irritating warnings
from cdrecord/libscg, 2. making libscg actually scan all transports and
not just one when looking for devices.
It is pretty clear now that the Linux kernel developers do not care if
your application bitches at users because you don't like a particular
interface.
