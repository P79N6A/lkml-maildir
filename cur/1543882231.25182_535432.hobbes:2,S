This fixes and OOPS due to incorrect socket orpahning in the
IRDA stack.
[IrDA]: Correctly handling socket error
This patch fixes an oops first reported in mid 2006 - see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/29/358
 The cause of this bug report is that
when an error is signalled on the socket, irda_recvmsg_stream returns
without removing a local wait_queue variable from the socket's sk_sleep
queue. This causes havoc further down the road.
In response to this problem, a patch was made that invoked sock_orphan on
the socket when receiving a disconnect indication. This is not a good fix,
as this sets sk_sleep to NULL, causing applications sleeping in recvmsg
(and other places) to oops.
This is against the latest net-2.6 and should be considered for -stable
inclusion.
