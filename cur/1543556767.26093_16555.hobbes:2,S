 Oh no, we don't use that.  Even though we could, it's rare -- it exists
for EISA systems only and then mostly older ones (i.e. non-PCI ones).
 In fact the only chipset that provides these additional NMI sources I
have docs for is the i82350 one.

 An ability to choose a NMI frequency, especially such a low one, would be
desirable but it is really inexistent for most IA32 systems.
