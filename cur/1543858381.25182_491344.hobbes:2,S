As stated, the kernel headers have nothing to do with user space code.
But I'll educate you a little more.
First, high resolution timers are not in 2.6.18.  The hrtimers are, but
the actual meat that makes them high resolution wont be in until
(hopefully) 2.6.20 (or perhaps a little later).
To use the high resolution timers (when they are in), you don't need to
do anything special.  nanosleep, and all the posix timers will get them
automatically.
