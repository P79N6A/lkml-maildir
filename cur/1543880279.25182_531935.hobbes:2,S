Ok, stuck them in, and my debug patch from yesterday, just in case...
However, I can't seem to run long enough to establish whether the
problem is gone. It deadlocks between 10-30 minutes due to missing IO
completions, whereas yesterday it took between 45-60 minutes to trigger
the 'desynchronized value of nfs_i.ncommit' messages.
I will continue trying go get a good run, however if you got some
(perhaps experimental .22) patches you want me to try..
