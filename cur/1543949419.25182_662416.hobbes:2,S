From compiler-gcc.h:
#define inline          inline          __attribute__((always_inline))
So unless I am missing something obvious then each time we
say inline to a function we require gcc to inline the function.
It is my impression that today we only say inline if really needed
and otherwise let gcc decide. So in almost all cases inlise should
just be nuked?
