I am not asking that these features be implemented today. I am asking
that enough planning go into the architecture today to make sure that
these features can be built in the future without tearing up the
graphics system for a third time.
This is the essence of my complaint about this patch. The patch
introduces a new low level graphics API to the kernel. Once we put an
API in it is basically impossible to get it back out. I am not
convinced that enough planning has gone into this API yet.
I'm also not convinced that there is a transition plan in place to
ensure that all drivers get updated to this new API. The last thing we
want is to maintain two parallel sets of video drivers forever into
the future. V4L2 did something similar to this and orphaned a lot of
drivers that the distributions were forced into updating later.
Mode setting is intimately intertwined with the console. VT swapping
adds another messy layer which can and should be eliminated in a
redesign. Multi-seat and unicode add more complexity. All of this
needs to be designed as a unified system. Satisfying the needs of the
X server is the easiest piece of the puzzle.
