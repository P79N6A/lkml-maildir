Using signals to communicate with kernel threads is fairly unpleasant, IMO.
We have much simpler, faster and more idiomatic ways of communicating
between threads in-kernel and there are better ways in which userspace can
communicate with the kernel - system calls, for example...
So I think generally any move which gets us away from using signals in
kernel threads is moving in a good direction.

Where's the hang?  A user process is stuck on h_rwsem?
If so, would it be appropriate to convert the user process to use
down_foo_interruptible(), so that the operator can just kill the user
process as expected, rather than having to futz around killing kernel
threads?
