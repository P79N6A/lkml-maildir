Not really, since you are not answering my question at all... My
question is not why you need this codeo or how you are using it, it's
why you cannot use existing functionality to do the same? Look at
genhd.c, it has functions for checking/marking/clearing read-only bit on
a block_device.
And if this it to make sense for inclusion, io _must_ be ended with
-EROFS or similar.
It seems to me that this probably belongs in your test harness for
debugging purposes. At least in its current state it's not acceptable
for inclusion.
