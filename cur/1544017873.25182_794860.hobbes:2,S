Below is the revert+document commit that i have queued up.
Justin, could you try the tip/master tree (which has this fix included):
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/tip.git/README
does Firefox still work fine?

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "x86: signal: change type of paramter for sys_rt_sigreturn()"
This reverts commit 4217458dafaa57d8e26a46f5d05ab8c53cf64191.
Justin Madru bisected this commit, it was causing weird Firefox
crashes.
The reason is that GCC mis-optimizes (re-uses) the on-stack parameters of
the calling frame, which corrupts the syscall return pt_regs state and
thus corrupts user-space register state.
So we go back to the slightly less clean but more optimization-safe
method of getting to pt_regs. Also add a comment to explain this.
