Those two statements are contradictory. clearly the iseries cant use the
DMA API *now* so I dont see how that makes any difference. We're talking
about adding propper support for *addresssable* memory mapped devices
with limited size DMA-able windows to the DMA API, not adding support
for a whole new weird way of talking to devices. These devices work the
same way as all the other devices that use the DMA API but are simply
restricted in the range of addresses they can DMA from. they require no
special 'accessors'.
iseries cant work the usual way now and wont with these modifications -
so nothing is made worse.
