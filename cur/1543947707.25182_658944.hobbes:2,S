Sorry about that hunk, I didn't mean to keep that in there. In
my testing, I used the newly introduced parts as a loadable
module, and at one point the intention was to keep the existing
libfs functions as builtin and add a new Kconfig dependency in every
user of the new stuff whenever a file system gets converted.
I figured out later that hardly anyone could even try to build
without them as soon as all the trival file systems are moved
over, but forgot to make it always builtin.
