Hi
        I have just dono a (2nd version of the patch).  This version
        uses smp_call_function, but don't grab any lock inside.  I
        sent the version to the list.  It is also at:
http://carpanta.dc.fi.udc.es/~quintela/kernel/2.4.0-test9-pre7/slab_02.patch
Could you test if it is now safe in SMP Sparc also????  (/me has no
SMP Sparc's around nor knoledge about them :(
Later, Juan.
