Well, there may be a better way.  Suppose we change all the accounting code to 
work with nanoseconds.  That way when we do an accounting pass we would just add 
what has elapsed since the last pass.  Still need some way to do user timers 
that are tightly pegged to the clock.
A thought I had along these lines was to program a timer for each tick.  The PIT 
is much too slow for this, but the APIC timers seem to be rather easy to 
program.  I am not sure how fast the access is but it can not be anything like 
the PIT.  Under this scheme we would use the monotonic clock to figure out just 
how far out the next tick should be and program that.
This could be modified to use repeating hardware if it is available.  (What does 
the HPET provide?  Does it interrupt?)  Since the APIC clock is not the 
reference clock (the PIT & pm timer clock is) we would have to correct these 
from time to time but that is rather easy (I do it today in HRT code).
This brings up another issue.  We know what the PIT clock frequency is but not 
what the TSC clock frequency.  Currently we do a calibration run at boot to 
figure this but I can easily show that this run consistently gives the wrong 
answer (I am sure this has to do with the I/O access delays).  If we are going 
to use the TSC (or any other "clock" that is not derived from the PITs 
14.3181818MHZ ital) we need both a way to get the correct value AND a way to 
adjust it for drift over time.  (Possibly this is the same thing.)  Of course 
this is all just x86 stuff.  Other archs will have their own issues.
For what its worth, the current 2.6 HRT patch uses the PIT as the 1/HZ time 
interrupt.  It uses the APIC, if present, for the high-res interrupt source.
