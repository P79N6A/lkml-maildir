If Adrian [ 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/9/262
 ] does not want to be
the maintainer, ask if you can take over, including the name.
This smells a lot like the RPM case [ 
http://lwn.net/Articles/196523/
 ]
however, it does not look like anyone is going to call it rpm-ng just
because the original name is owned by the last maintainer.
