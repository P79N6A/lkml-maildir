Well, you can get rid of anything that way. The question is if the
interface is an appropriate one to use or not - i.e. if it makes for
better code in general, or if it make errors of programming less
likely.
I would argue that the latter is undoubtedly true - merely that
userspace flock/fcntl works that way would argue for it, but there
are a couple of other reasons too. 
Going against is the point that it may be slower.  Can you dig out your
implementation and show me it?  I wasn't going for assembler in my hasty
example.  I just wanted to establish that it's easy, so that it becomes
known that its easy, and folks therefore aren't afraid of it.  That both
you and I have had to write it implies that it's not obvious code to
everyone.
