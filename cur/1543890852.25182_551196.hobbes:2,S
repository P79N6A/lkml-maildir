I wonder if (over-)engineering could hurt its adoption by more kernel
users. There aren't very many 8-argument monsters in the kernel,
and one would expect hexdump() to be easier on the fingers to
type? :-) Why not just continue with reasonable default/fixed rowsize
and groupsize values?

if (ascii) {
...
}
linebuf[lx++] = '\0';
would help lose a goto and label.
