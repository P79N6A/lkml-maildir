i had a few minutes the other day, so i extracted just the rb-tree part of
2.2.5-arca10, and benchmarked it against 2.2.5 and against the hash tuning
patch i'm working on.  i ran this on our 512M 4-way Dell PowerEdge 6300.
ref - 2.2.5 kernel with 4000 process slots and b_state fix
rbt - 2.2.5 kernel with 4000 process slots and rbtree patch applied
        (b_state fix *not* applied)
hash - 2.2.5 kernel with an older version of my hash tuning patch applied
        (b_state fix applied)
160 concurrent scripts.  all of the benchmark fits in memory.
ref:  3725.8 s=15.23
rbt:  3893.3 s=9.82
hash: 4007.3 s=15.95
"hash" tunes the page cache, the buffer cache, the dentry cache, and the
inode cache.  "rbt" just replaces the page cache with per-inode rbtrees.
i think the rbtree patch compares pretty favorably for very large memory
machines.
