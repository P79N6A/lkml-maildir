Oh, it also penalize all other 1,055 call site of clear_bit(), though I don't
know how many actually needs memory barrier.  I suspect some need "lock"
barrier, some need "unlock" barrier, and of course some needs full fence.
Why not make unlock_buffer use test_and_clear_bit()?  Utilizing it's implied
full memory fence and throw away the return value?  OK, OK, this is obscured.
Then introduce clear_bit_memory_fence API or some sort.
