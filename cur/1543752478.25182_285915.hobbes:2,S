Subject: [PATCH] release_pcibus_dev() crash

During the course of a hotplug removal of a PCI bus, release_pcibus_dev()
attempts to remove attribute files from a kobject directory that no longer
exists.  The calls that cause the crash were recently added, and this patch
removes them.  The partial oops traceback, observed on ppc64, is:

...
The removal of the class device from sysfs is carried out explicitly by
class_device_del(), which occurs prior to class_device_put().  The class device
is gone from sysfs by the time class_device_put() is called.  As such, this
release function should not carry out sysfs cleanups for the class device.
I'm unsure how pci_remove_legacy_files() doesn't cause the same crash for those
who implemented it, but I'll leave that alone for now.
Thanks-
John
