Subject: Linux kernel module to cause OOPS on demand?

I need a way to cause the kernel to oops on demand. This needs to work with an
arbitrary kernel version, and it would be preferable as a module. I recall that
awhile back (possibly running 2.0.x), there was a joystick driver revision that
had an action (unintended) like this. I suppose I could just modify the
joystick driver to deference a null pointer when a button is pressed, but I
thought I'd ask if anyone had built a module/patch for this purpose already.
