Please don't use a hammer on that tack... The Redhat errata gcc (as an
example) seems to be fine (see the nice list in the first post) and id's
as: 
   oddball:davidsen> gcc -v
   Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.96/specs
   gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.3 2.96-110)
People trying to get 2.5 kernels working want frame pointers and kernel
symbols so problems can be reported in a useful way. People running 2.5
kernels are probably more likely to have installed errata.
Perhaps a warning (UNSAFE?) in the config would be better, or whatever
else would avoid just blocking the ability to compile a debug kernel.
Yes, I see there's another newer yet gcc, 2.96-113, but it's been working
since -103.
