I think it would be better to evaluate existing solutions (eg. libpw).
Instead starting another one (which would lack any design since I
haven't seen any thread that was picking together requirements),
improving that existing one might also be helpful for applications
like ekiga.
As for libpw it also supports colourspace conversion and software
scaling, the used algorithms seem to need some improvement, but alot
work has already been done there.
Of course other libraries should also be taken into account, maybe
someone knows something better which is more complete.
