Directly replacing BKL was my first strategy but that looks to be
hard. Some of the sleeps are in the line discipline code which means I
have to find all of them. After replacing BKL I'd try to simplify the
locking.
What about adjusting things so the BKL isn't required? I tried
completely removing it and died in release_dev. tty_mutex is already
locks a lot of stuff, maybe it can be adjusted to allow removal of the
BKL.
I'm also trying to decide if read/write really need BKL when they are
called. Read/write already uses the atomic_read/write_lock mutexes.
read_chan has this comment:
 *	Perform reads for the line discipline. We are guaranteed that the
 *	line discipline will not be closed under us but we may get multiple
 *	parallel readers and must handle this ourselves. We may also get
 *	a hangup. Always called in user context, may sleep.
But read_chan is always called from tty_io.c with BKL held. So is
atomic_read_lock really doing anything or is it masked by BKL?
I see why no one works on this code, it is very intertwined with the
rest of the kernel and a lot of the reasons for locking are
non-obvious.
