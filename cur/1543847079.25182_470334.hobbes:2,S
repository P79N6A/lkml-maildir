Makes sense. I proposed this because I reconfigure my kernel with
"make oldconfig" and see new questions pop up. Maybe menuconfig and
xconfig should proeminently highlight NEW questions from the top-level
(by using a bold font on any item which is either new or has new
sub-items) so that users get a clear view of what they may need to
configure.
