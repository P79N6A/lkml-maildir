I tested this and the improvement is drastic.  With the default value of
1024KB, running 'bonnie' produced XRUNS of 10+ ms.  When this is changed
to 16KB, running bonnie only produces latency spikes of up to about 90
usecs, I did not see a single one hit 100usecs.
According to hdparm, the throughput is still quite good (42MB/sec on a 
sub-$100 IDE drive).
This should definitely be made tunable, I would imagine this would be
easy to put in /proc.  The default could stay at 1024KB, and users with
low latency requirements could lower it.
I am currently testing the effect on throughput and will have some
better numbers soon.
