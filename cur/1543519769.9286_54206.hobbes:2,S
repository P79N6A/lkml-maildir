	AIX has only one level of threads.  However, there are two ways of
acessing them.  Via AIX's native kernel_thread calls (pre-POSIX), or via
pthreads (which just wrappers the native calls).  The end result in the
kernel is the same.  It is quite similar to the difference on linux of
using pthreads or calling clone() yourself.
