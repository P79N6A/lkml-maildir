Surely Linux uses entirely original code, with no hangovers from the
original AT&T Unix...  Besides, to the best of my recollection, the two
operations are equal in speed on a PDP-11.
"!!" makes sense as an idiom.  But "^" for "!=" doesn't, at least not in 
this context.

Yes, sometimes XOR can yield simpler object code.  But not in cases like 
this, where it's part of a Boolean test:
	if (... && (a1^b1) && (a2^b2) && (a3^b3)) ...
On any architecture I know of, "^" and "!=" would be equally efficient 
here.
