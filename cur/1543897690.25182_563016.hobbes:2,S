I don't doubt that it shows real benefits; but dangerously cutting
corners usually shows benefits too.  Relying on a uid at this level
feels very wrong to me - but as I said, I've not found a killer
argument against it.
And we both know that clear_page features so high in part because
it's bringing cachelines in from the cold, which are about to be
accessed again by userspace; so it's often not so bad as it appears.
Though I probably wouldn't be citing that argument if we were
talking about offloading clear_page to another engine.
