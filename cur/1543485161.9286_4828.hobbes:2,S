Subject: Userland NFS Server broken?

I am running latest 2.2.2pre2 kernel,
with RedHat-5.2 underneath, plus many updates.
I've been having trouble for a while now
getting a FreeBSD-2.2.7 box to play nicely
over NFS with my Linux Box acting as server.
Things just lock up with "NFS server not responding" messages.
So.. I tried doing this on the Linux box, so it talks to itself:
	mount localhost:/ /a
	mount localhost:/ /b
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/a/junk bs=1024k count=1024
	diff /a/junk /b/junk
	diff /a/junk /b/junk
	...
And it *usually* locks up in short order with the same error
(NFS server not responding).  Sometimes it fails sooner when
I use a second window to do something like:  "ls -R /a"
This is with knfsd support NOT configured into the kernel,
so everything is standard userland stuff.
Shouldn't this work?
