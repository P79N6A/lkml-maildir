I believe that most BIOS's only do the floppy modes.  What is really
needed is a two stage boot loader that can get the CD into working order
and get the kernel running with an arbitrary sized root fileset,
preferably the whole CD.
Does GRUB do this?  Or would you need to pre-boot with a mini-linux kernel
with every concievable CDROM and removable media driver compiled in?
I thought at one point someone was working on code so that you could boot
a kernel off a device that was only a module driver (without initrd). This
would fix this problem too.
Ciao!
