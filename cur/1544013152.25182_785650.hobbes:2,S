It's not clear whether you should believe this.  The manual may have 
overstated things.  Still, better to be safe.

Yes -- but they don't suspend the device; instead they disable its 
upstream port.  As far as the device is concerned, there's no 
difference.  However the Linux API doesn't include any way to disable a 
USB port.  Maybe we should add one...

They are.

That is indeed the next step to take.
