I know. But I don't like the idea of 'putting something in' that later
might turn out incompatible with something else. The minimum support
from the Dwarf spec I'd expect here would be an equivalent to IA64's
.unwabi. But truly I think the processor-specific pieces of Dwarf's
frame unwind spec should provide numbering for the complete set of
registers.
