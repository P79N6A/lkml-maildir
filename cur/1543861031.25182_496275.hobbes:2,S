Even though these patches are potentially destabilazing, I'd like them 
(and a few other patches) to go into 2.6.20:
- kvm did not exist in 2.6.19, hence we cannot regress from that
- this patchset is the difference between a working proof of concept and 
a generally usable system
- from my testing, it's quite stable

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
