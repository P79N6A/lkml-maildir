Hi,
Suspend-to-RAM works fine on my new Dell Latitude D420 (with Core Duo) in
2.6.16, but it broke in 2.6.17 -- the machine suspends just fine, but when it
resumes, the disk never spins up, the screen stays black and it just hangs.
Bisecting shows that the following commit is where it broke:

    [PATCH] on_each_cpu(): disable local interrupts
    When on_each_cpu() runs the callback on other CPUs, it runs with local
    interrupts disabled.  So we should run the function with local interrupts
    disabled on this CPU, too.
    And do the same for UP, so the callback is run in the same environment on both
    UP and SMP.  (strictly it should do preempt_disable() too, but I think
    local_irq_disable is sufficiently equivalent).
    Also uninlines on_each_cpu().  softirq.c was the most appropriate file I could
    find, but it doesn't seem to justify creating a new file.
    Oh, and fix up that comment over (under?) x86's smp_call_function().  It
    drives me nuts.
Applying the patch in reverse against 2.6.17 (it doesn't apply cleanly, but
I've done what seems to be the moral equivalent) makes the suspend work
again.
Any ideas? It does not work with the latest git checkout as of today.
