Hmm.  I just moved my sata_sil stuff out of the way and rebooted:
$ uptime; grep scsi_cmd_cache /proc/slabinfo
 23:22:16 up 4 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.03, 0.00
scsi_cmd_cache      1200   1200    384   10    1 : tunables   54   27   8 : slabdata    120    120      0
My other workstation also runs 2.6.15.1 but uses sata_nv and doesn't
exhibit the problem.
