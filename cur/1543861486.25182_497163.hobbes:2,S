That's 
	and    $0xf,%dl
	movzbl %dl,%edx
	lea    (%ecx,%edx,4),%edx
	movzbl %bl,%eax
	mov    %eax,(%esp)
	mov    %esi,%ecx
	mov    %edi,%eax
	mov    0xfffffff0(%ebp),%ebx
**	call   *0x68(%ebx)		**
	add    $0x8,%esp
	pop    %ebx
	pop    %esi
	pop    %edi
	pop    %ebp
	ret
which is ipv4_conntrack_help():
	return help->helper->help(pskb,
		(*pskb)->nh.raw - (*pskb)->data
				+ (*pskb)->nh.iph->ihl*4,
		ct, ctinfo);
and that call instruction is the one that oopses because "help->helper" is 
corrupt (it's 0x9f5cea37 - not a valid kernel pointer).
David, there really *is* something screwy in netfilter.
