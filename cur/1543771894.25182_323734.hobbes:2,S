It depends on how the switch from MSI to MSI-X is supposed to work.
I'm thinking of the following sort of sequence:
	pci_disable_msi(dev);
	if (pci_enable_msix(dev,...)) {
		register MSIX stuff
	} else {
		/* MSIX won't work...fall back to MSI */
		pci_enable_msi(dev);
	}
and that makes a bad assumption MSI will work.
