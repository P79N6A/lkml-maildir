I get this when building using debian's make-kpkg:
The UTS Release version in include/linux/version.h
     ""
does not match current version:
     "2.6.18-rc2"
Please correct this.
I didnt test building -rc1 this way yet, so I dont know when this was 
introduced, but I don't have this problem with 2.6.17.y
