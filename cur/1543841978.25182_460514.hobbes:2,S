Hi,
    Just going through the sdio specs and ossman's patch.
   What are these functions and thier numbers in CMD 53
   Does that mean an SDIO Card can support upto 8 different functions?.
   An sdio card can be used as a wlan and camera (if it supports 2
functions wlan and camera).
  Is it like that?. Because i have not come across a card which
supports more than one function.
  What does "function" mean - does that mean some kind of firmware
inside the card or some kind electronics.
  I dont understand.
Thanks and Regards,
Jo
