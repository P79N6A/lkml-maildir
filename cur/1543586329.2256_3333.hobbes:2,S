Hello,
I just got my first fs corruption too(2.4.3), but using reiserfs on LVM ,
and the volume group is also on IDE.
Accessing some /usr/src/linux/... file my system "hang" or just rebooted.
using reiserfsck "fixed" this for me.
I'm using the Asus A7V board, but comparable chipset, with the athlon
1.1GHz.
