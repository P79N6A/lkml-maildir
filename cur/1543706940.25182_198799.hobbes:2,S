could you try dm-crypt? It uses the device-mapper instead of the loop
device but should be compatible (uses cryptoapi too). It's going to be
added to the kernel soon I hope.
You can find a patch on 
http://www.saout.de/misc/
 against the vanilla
kernel (dm-crypt.diff), I just rediffed it against linux 2.6.2.
You need the dmsetup tool from the device-mapper package to set up
encryption. There's also a shell script called cryptsetup on the page
that wraps around dmsetup. It requires the hashalot program.
It shouldn't oops. But if the deadlock you were seeing didn't come from
loop-aes it might also show up here. If you're willing to test - let me
know. :)
