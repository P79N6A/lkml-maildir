Thanks for the quick reply. Sar seems to indicate that the server is 
disk-bound (although some swapping is going on, so more RAM is on the way). 
CPU is idle, consistently, 99% of the time. 
Would upgrading the kernel help the disk performance? Server is not 
connected to the internet, so security concerns are not *that* important, 
but performance is ...
