Generally speaking, DMA-ing from stack is not allowed. Maybe you want
to add a comment saying "buffer on stack because this is Mac-only driver".
I would not ask for kmalloc here which is entirely pointless.

So, why don't you check for Geyser 3 or whatnot here instead of doing
it inside the work function? Why poking workqueue on other systems?

I'm wondering about the wisdom of this too. Why won't the stock
workqueue work? We have way too many daemons already. Plus, making
one more unconditionally regardless of hardware present seems like
stepping over the line to me.
Overall this seems like a good patch to me, only needs to be less
intrusive for owners of other hardware.
