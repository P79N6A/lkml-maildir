...and people running older kernels get different results (no surprise)
fwiw, I ran 'top' on 5 terminals with xterm-spam running concurrently
on 2.6.15 (rxvt, pterm, xterm, konsole and gnome-terminal).
For that case, gnome-terminal was definitely the slowest,
and used the most CPU time (more than a factor of three slower
than xterm).  konsole was about 2.5, pterm was about the same
as xterm, and rxvt about half the CPU (ymmv).
