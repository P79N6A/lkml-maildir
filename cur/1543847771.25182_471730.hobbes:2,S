Because using /dev/random whlie /dev/hw_random is available does not always

Why is this happening in userland? Will rng-tools run on every bare Linux
system now? Including embedded systems? How about xen guests who don't have
direct access to the host's hardware (or software) random?
Why is this entropy management not part of the kernel? So for Openswan to
work correctly, it would need to depend on another daemon that may or may
not be available and/or running?
I still believe /dev/random should just give the best random possible for
the machine. Wether that is software random, or a piece of hardware, should
not matter. That's the kernel's internal state and functioning.
But thanks for the software pointer.
