Postgres chooses not to try and duplicate OS functionality in it's I/O 
routines.
it doesn't try to determine where on disk the data is (other then 
splitting the data into multiple files and possibly spreading things 
between directories)
it doesn't try to do it's own readahead.
it _does_ maintain it's own journal, but depends on the OS to do the right 
thing when a fsync is issued on the files.
yes it could be re-written to do all this itself, but the project has 
decided not to try and figure out the best options for all the different 
filesystems and OS's that it runs on and instead trust the OS developers 
to do reasonable things instead.
besides, do you really want to have every program doing it's own 
readahead?
