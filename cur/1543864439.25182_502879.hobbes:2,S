Ok. In that case, you'd want to delay trying to wake them until resuming
is completed.
Unless there's something I've forgotten, we don't currently have an easy
way for you to determine when processes are thawed. Perhaps this
indicates a need for us to have a notifier chain for the end of a cycle?
You could create a freezeable workqueue and schedule work from your
device_resume call (assuming that's doesn't raised atomicity issues),
but I wonder if that approach would be too heavy handed for what you're
after. I'll explicitly cc Rafael and see what he thinks.

Nigel
