Turns out that the analysis that lead to the above numbers was subtly
flawed. Together with Arvend Bayer, I've come up with a new analysis
where the "effect" falls off surprisingly rapidly. In the end, an
n-bit number will have n-2 bits of entropy. I throw off a third bit
just to be safe.

If entropy were truly scarce, we could do that. For folks who are
getting starved, my current patch set has a tunable called trust_pct,
which effectively lets you mix in untrusted entropy in hundredths of a
bit.

We'd need to be able to do a non-integer log2 to do much better.
That's putting too much faith in the model, which is just some
handwaving that keyboard and mouse interrupts, etc., ought to follow
the magical "distribution of distributions". Fortunately, you can vary
quite a bit from that distribution into various gamma forms and the
like and still fall within a bit or so of the presumed entropy, which
is why I've added another bit of safety margin.
I'll repost my patches as soon as I take a swing at the /dev/random vs
/dev/urandom pool business.
