Yes, you are right in this regard. An interrupt handler does steal the
time slice from the interrupted process.
So now I think it is considered an acceptable deviation in calculating
the process run time as well as determine process scheduling because
an ISR should take very short time to return, in part as a consequence
of the rule that ISR should not sleep.
