Don't do this.   Alan already has a sane version in his tree which I've made
ready for and sent to Marcelo.  It wouldn't hurt if you read lkml..
The patch you posted is the crap directly from the XFfree repo and backs out
kernel changes.  It might be enough for a random collection of junk patches
but certainly does not meet the quality criteria for official kernels.
