Possibly <=, but at least both 6Y120P0 (120G, 8M cache) en 6Y120L0 
(120G, 2M cache) are affected. Experiencing it myself on 6Y120P0.

As to logistics... must say I'd already be satisfied with a new firmware 
  downloadable from the maxtor site and a means to upload it. Of course, 
a linux means would be best for me. If not possible, real-mode DOS is 
useable.

Thanks for responding! Please do consider making an updated firmware 
available through the site...
