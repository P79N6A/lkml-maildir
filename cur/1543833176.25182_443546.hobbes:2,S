Subject: [x86_64] strange delays since 2.6.15 (was: Re: ohci1394: aborting transmission)

Hello Stefan, hello all,
sorry for not getting back to you earlier. I was not asleep though and 
the problem has not gone away - it has become worse, much worse and it 
turns out that it might not have anything to do with ohci1394 at all, 
but read on (if you're curious):
I've noticed the strange delay during bootup in 2.6.17-mm6 and thought 
"hm, this did not occur in 2.6.16...right?" but I really I have not paid 
attention to the bootup process of this box. in fact, i had no access to 
this box for a few month and have not tracked -current for a while and 
when I got access again we were somewhere at 2.6.17-rc* and I have not 
paid attention to the bootup at all.
I am currently in the middle of bisecting and I found out that
    - 2.6.14 is fine, no delays during bootup
    - 2.6.15-rc1 is showing these delays
"git-bisect log" shows (uh, linewraps):

So, b7df3910c1298fee8ed7b9dfd2da74b85df5539c is bad, meaning it shows 
these delays. I've done another "git-bisect bad" after this but now 
compiling fails (see below) and now I'm stuck again.
I shall remove the ohci1394 guys from the Cc: and hope that some 
git-guru can help out, when compiling a git-bisect'ed kernel fails not 
because of being "bad" but because of compile-breakage :(
just for the record:

yes, I've done that with 2.6.17-*, did not help...
Thanks,
