Yes, but R200 family(8500 and 9100, aka 8500LE) are the _faster_ ATI out there
with FOSS 3D support.
ATI was playing with the boards numbers to try to sell more. But 9200 and 9000,
based on RV250, are more expensive and slower than any R200 based.

Last time that I heard about it, 9500/9600/9700/9800 only work on 2D.
