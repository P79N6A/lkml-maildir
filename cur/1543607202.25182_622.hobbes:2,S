Subject: [PATCH} cpqfc, eliminate virt_to_bus + fix passthrough bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Patch description:
   * reinitialize Cmnd->SCp.sent_command (used to identify commands as
     passthrus) on calling scsi_done, since the scsi mid layer does not
     use (or reinitialize) this field to prevent subsequent comands from
     having it set incorrectly. 
   * Revise driver to use new kernel 2.4.x PCI DMA API, instead of 
     virt_to_bus().  (enables driver to work w/ ia64 systems with >2Gb RAM.)
     Rework main scatter-gather code to handle cases where SG element
     lengths are larger than 0x7FFFF bytes and use as many scatter 
     gather pages as necessary. (Steve Cameron)
   * Makefile changes to bring cpqfc into line w/ rest of SCSI drivers
     (thanks to Keith Owens)
Patch is large, so it's here:
http://www.geocities.com/dotslashstar/cpqfc_2.1.1_for_2.4.12-ac5.txt
Patch applies to 2.4.12-ac5 and to 2.4.13-pre6.
