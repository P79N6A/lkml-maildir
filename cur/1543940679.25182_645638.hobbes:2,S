I downloaded your patch for 2.6.23 and cloned your git repository.
From a first glance, it looks like there is indeed a lot of overlap.
>I would like to take a look at your patches. Where can I get them?
You can find the changes in the mm branch of the x86 git. Do they keep
the patches there, somewhere, as well?
You should get the best overview if you look at arch/x86/kernel/ds.c,
include/asm-x86/ds.h, include/asm-x86/ptrace-abi.h, and
arch/x86/kernel/ptrace.c or simply grep for BTS.
I have all the patches that I submitted but they rather protocol
development than describe the final thing.

From a brief look at your patch, I would say that we should rather
combine the configuration and collection part. They are very similar.
We might still want to provide different interfaces on top of it.
In particular, I think the ptrace interface is most appropriate for
debuggers.

Debugging was my target;-)

Are you planning to get the perfmon patch into the kernel? Or do you
want it to remain a separate patch?
In the first case, we should try to merge the features. In the second
case, refining the MSR allocator would probably be best.
thanks and regards,
markus.
