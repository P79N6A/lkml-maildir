No!  The file-system must be mounted read-only upon startup! There
are exceptions in embedded systems and special systems that build
file-systems (root file-system ram-disks) upon startup.

Correct.
The init scripts should check the file-systems (using fsck) and
then mount them read-write. If you (or init) executes fsck
on r/w mounted file-systems, you may (read will) destroy them.
Look in /etc/rc.d to see what happens upon startup. Something
like `fsck -A -V -a` gets executed. Then, after than happens,
something like `mount -n -o remount,rw /` gets executed. Then,
to update /etc/mtab, somewhere there will be a `mount -f /`.
