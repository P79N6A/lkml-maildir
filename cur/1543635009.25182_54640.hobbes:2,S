This sounds like a job for [dum de dum dum] capabilities... remember,
on Linux root hasn't been almighty for a very long time, it's just a
matter of which capabilities you retain.  Of course, if you really
want to be safe, you might end up with a rather castrated root inside
the chroot shell.
If you really want to jail something, use UML.
