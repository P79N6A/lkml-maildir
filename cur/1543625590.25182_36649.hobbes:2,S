	If it locks up, that's a bug. I remember older versions of glibc actually 
had this bug. But it should simply fail to create them.

	Why increase the number of threads you can create before you trigger a bug? 
Wouldn't it make more sense to *fix* the bug so that pthread_create returns 
an error like it's supposed to?
	In any event, don't create so many threads. Create threads only to keep CPUs 
busy or to pend I/Os that can't be done asynchronously.
