Why?  It would only return the original duplication in binary form and
save a minimal amount of time for something already slow - a system
call.  With small caches, the code duplication could even waste more
performance than the missing function call would gain you.
Other nits were well-picked.

You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks
occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a
speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
