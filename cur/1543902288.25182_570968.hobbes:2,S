Absolutely not: You can't call change_page_attr(), or more precisely
global_flush_tlb(), with interrupts disabled. And since interrupt disabling
is unneeded here afaics, I simply changed the calls instead of inventing
some ugly workaround.
I'll do the other adjustments you asked for, but it'll be only in about three
weeks from now...
