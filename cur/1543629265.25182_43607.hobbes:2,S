I *want* the logical / ordinal abstraction. That's not a negative thing -
it reduces the number of complicated things I have to think about,
allowing me to think more clearly, and write correct code ;-)
Not having a multitude of zones to balance in the normal discontigmem
case also seems like a powerful argument to me ...
