Same here with 2.2.10-ac10. Running CDRDAO and interrupting the task
via SIGINT or SIGQUIT (as mentioned in the man-page) leads to kernel panic.
This is reproducible on two different machines with two different 
SCSI-Adapters (AHA-2940UW and Initio 9100U). Both machines were
single-processor, K6(266) and K6/3D(400). I would really like to append
a dump, but since it resulted in a filesystem-corruption last time, I'm
a little bit afraid to kill the machine this way. :-)
