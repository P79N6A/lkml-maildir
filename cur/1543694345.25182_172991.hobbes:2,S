This is completely bogus logic.  I can use this (incorrect) argument to 
similar push for applications doing bsearch(3) or qsort(3) via a system 
call.
When the _implementation_ requires that a piece of code be in-kernel 
(for performance or security, usually), it is.
In this case, there is no such requirement.  More below.

Processors are trending towards putting RNG on the CPU.  VIA won't be 
the last, I predict.  When generating random bits is a single 
instruction, "xstore", userspace applications _should_ be directly using 
this.  It should not be in-kernel.  And similarly, if there is no 
requirement that the kernel's entropy pool is used, the userspace 
application _should_ be where the implementation lives.
So, given that trend and also given the existing /dev/[u]random, I 
disagree completely:  /dev/frandom is the perfect example of something 
that should _not_ be in the kernel.  If you want /dev/urandom faster, 
then solve _that_ problem.  Don't try to solve a /dev/urandom problem by 
creating something totally new.
