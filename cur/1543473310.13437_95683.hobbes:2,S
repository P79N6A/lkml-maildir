Hi,
	The tulip driver included with the 2.2.0-pre1 kernel contains the 
following bit of code which now causes an error when compiling. 
Donald,
	I know that the driver in the development kernel is an older
version. Would you suggest upgrading to a newer version ( which Linus
doesn't seem to want to do - I remember this being mentioned before on the
list ) or would just patching the current driver be an better solution
considering the major code freeze? Thanks in advance for your input.
