Yes, this patch is the correct fix, also for -rc3-mm1 (which has the same 
problem).
Andrew, I hadn't the time to look at how you fixed up rejects in last merge 
([PATCH] uml: allow building as 32-bit binary on 64bit host)*; the rejects 
came from the SKAS0 merge, and while you were fixing the patch up you deleted 
by mistake the line which is readded in this patch.
