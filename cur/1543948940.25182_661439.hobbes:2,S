Yeah, we can trickle that in later.  Fine by me.
I think rather more conflict is likely with the 105 files where I just
removed the asm/semaphore.h include.  I'd like it if we could get Linus
to merge those at this stage.  Since it passes an x86 allmodconfig
build, I'd like to think the breakage would be minimal.
