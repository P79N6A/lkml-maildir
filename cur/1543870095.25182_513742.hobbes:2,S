I've bisected myself 2.6.20-mm2 instead. And the winners are:
x86_64-mm-adjust-inclusion-of-asm-fixmap_h.patch
x86_64-mm-adjust-inclusion-of-asm-vsyscall32_h.patch
The former breaks the compilation in a different way. The latter fixes
it but causes the breakage I reported originally.
Does it really matter anyway? Even in mainline,
include/asm-x86_64/io_apic.h uses MAX_IO_APICS, so it should include
the header file which defines it, that is <asm/apicdef.h>. It doesn't,
that's a bug, let's just fix it. Same for i386. So what about pushing
my patch to Linus right away?
Thanks,
