I'm running:
  * SMP Pentium 4 w/ hyperthreading enabled (IBM x345)
  * Dual QLogic 2340 HBAs
  * STK D280 Disk Array (nothing in logs)
  * Kernel 2.6.11.5 (built around March 24th)
  * 2.6.11-rc3-udm2 patch
  * linux-2.6.11-NFS_ALL patch (this was critical for me)
I'm using DM to make four multipath devices (each device is a 1TB lun)
and then one stripe made from the four multipaths.  Because the array
is unsupported by multipathd (at least in the code I have) it can only
failover once.  We then manually fail it back to primary if that
happens (which hasn't happened outside of testing).
