Hi All,
In a similar vein to the Linksys router.  I have a Buffalo (Melco) WBR-G54.
Looking through the latest firmware update available :
http://www.buffalo-technology.com/support/firmware.htm
It does appear to be similar to the Linksys firmware and contain linux and
possibly busybox
No mention here or anywhere on there site of the GPL or the source code to
what they are distributing!
Unfortunately an nmap scan only shows the following ports open:
Starting nmap V. 3.00 ( www.insecure.org/nmap )
Interesting ports on  (192.168.0.1):
(The 1597 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
Port       State       Service
53/tcp     open        domain
80/tcp     open        http
2601/tcp   open        zebra
2602/tcp   open        ripd
Remote operating system guess: Linux Kernel 2.4.0 - 2.5.20
Uptime 1.252 days (since Sat Jun 07 15:51:52 2003)
Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13 seconds
No telnet or ssh for me to try to discover more.
