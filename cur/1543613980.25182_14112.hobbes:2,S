not always true, inb() doesn't compile without -O for example.

I'm quite comfortable with the requirement, only I can't imagine
code which depends on -O and -O2 difference. Inline assembly is
handled by compiler so it should not break things ..
Maybe externaly linked assembly code ? But optimization level should
not change register usage in calling convention ..
Please can you give me example which kind of code breaks those
expectations ?
Thanks, Martin
