If you ever decide to do this, you can make it much easier on yourself 
by doing a "bait and switch": create a new function that wraps the
currently exported one and exposes a clean, sane interface. Then, 
convert the users to call this new function. When they're all converted,
un-export the old one, then take it out back and do away with it. This
allows a step-by-step conversion without having to coordinate a big
"flag day" cutover..
