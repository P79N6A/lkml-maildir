`inline, dammit' is
  __attribute__((always_inline))
The original `inline' never guarantees that the function will be 
inlined.
Therefore, `inline' is already #define'd in the Linux kernel to always 
be __attribute__((always_inline)).

That's exactly how `inline' is already #define'd in the Linux kernel.
And __always_inline is currently simply #define'd to `inline' ...
