Turning your words around, you get: "Whatever one of these programs does
documents how dynamic devices should be handled." If this is true, any
change that makes one of these programs break is a kernel bug.
Besides that: How am I supposed to be able to correctly change udev if
there is no document telling me what would work and what happens to
work by accident?

Some people like to fool around and create even smaller wheels.
E.g. I'm changing the ACPI button driver to just call Ctrl_alt_del
in order not to have an extra process running and free 0.2 % of my RAM.

I once tried to install a firmware for hotplug. Even finding the place whre
I'm supposed to put it was harder than rewriting that *beep* from start,
but I could not rewrite it because I didn't have any documentation.
Even digging in that pile of wrapper scrips in order to debug that thing
was a nightmare. (Having a number of places where the firmware will be
expected in one of many versions and formats stored using one of many
filenames can drive you nuts.)

I suppose that's missing, too. Or scattered in a number of contradicting
and mostly outdated howtos across the internet.

In other words: Grasping sysfs is not a feasible task? If this is true,
how can anybody reliably use sysfs?
