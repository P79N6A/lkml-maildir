Subject: linux-2.4.10aa1 not umounting the root file system during shut-down

I don't know whether this bug is a problem of 2.4.10 or its aa1 or
the "umount" program under SuSE-7.2 for Intel.
But things changed between 2.4.10pre5 and 2.4.10aa1.
During the boot, the root file system is always picked up
by "fsck" as unmounted cleanly.
Thank you.
Regards,
Hugh
