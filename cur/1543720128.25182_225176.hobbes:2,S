Or have the exec() call set a "part of a process" flag. That means that 
if I read an executable in as data it doesn't get locked, other than 
what part might be in my i/o buffers. And mmap can produce different 
effects than read/write which may be good, if they are GOOD different 
effects ;-) Before you ask, thing 'strings' as why avg user does this.
But I fail to make my point... I want to limit how much memory is used 
for i/o buffers, cache, or anything else which will produce memory 
pressure of my programs. The quick solution might be just a number from 
the admin, like the 2.2 patch, but some kernel logic to understand that 
while 20MB is much better than 10MB in a tiny system, 2GB is not a lot 
better than 1GB in a large memory system, and having a sync() bog the 
system for tens of seconds is undesirable. Well, maybe some folks don't 
agree, it could be that the admin set limit is really the way to go.
I regard this as a desktop issue, trading some i/o performance to keep 
window changes fast.

That's what would be nice with tuning, the admin can optimize what is 
important on that system. I am usually happy with what the system does 
on i/o, but I want my 500MB or so of programs to stay resident in a 2GB 
machine, and if that adds a ms or two to i/o I can live with it, so that 
when I change windows it happens now, not eventually. And I bet there 
are a lot of others who would like better response to focus changes aswell.
