Oliver, can you please explain your worries in a bit more detail?
I don't claim to know anything about how STR or hibernate works, but
neither seem to have any problem with I/O on the fuse device "racing"
with them.
And conceptually I can't see anything that would cause trouble either.
The fuse kernel module just provides a specialized IPC mechanism,
where one userspace process communicates with another using file
operations and a char dev.
