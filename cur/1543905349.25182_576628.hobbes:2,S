The idea is not good enough for mainline and has no place in mainline
yet you say it's very important to maintain it... but out of mainline.
Place the responsibility of keeping mainline's performance in check
"reality check as you called it" on to someone who is forced to
develop out of mainline? I have zero interest one way or the other
myself, but how can one not chuckle?
Again I have no interest either way but if this is that important a
reality check that it needs maintaining it should be oh I don't know,
an -mm only feature or something?
Please don't jump down my throat, your position just needs clarifying.  :-|
