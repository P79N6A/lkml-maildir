Even better, what do you do upon link(2)?  Or rename(2) over one of the

VMS is not UNIX.  And union of these two will be hell - incompatible models,
let alone features.  "Well, I don't use <list of Unix features>" is not an

can be sure that every thing you don't care about is absolute must-have
for somebody else.
