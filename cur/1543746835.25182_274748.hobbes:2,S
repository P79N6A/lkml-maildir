Yupp.  Premature optimization is the roo of all evil.  swsusp is
 a) an absolute slowpath compared to any normal kernel operation,
    and called extremly seldomly
 b) only usefull for a small subset of all linux instances
hacking core code (fastpathes) for speedups there is a really bad idea.
If you can speed it up without beeing intrusive all power to you.

Honestly I think it's a feature so obscure that we wouldn't ever want to
merge it unless it just happens to work as a fallout of a more important
feature.
