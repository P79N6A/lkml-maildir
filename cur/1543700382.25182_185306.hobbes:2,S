Hi,
Oh I forgot to say that i'm running RAID1 and it detects both drives
perfectly (I'm passing the IDE addresses to the kernel at boot time from the
lilo conf, see previous post). The system was reinstalled yesterday with two
brand new 80GB Western Digital disks (WD800JB-00DUA3). The thing is, I have
succesfully installed the TX2000 card with the native ATARAID drivers before
using two 30GB Maxtor (something) disks and kernel 2.4-20 - 2.4.23. I wonder
why I can't get it up and running now. It will only work with the pre
compiled kernel shipped with Debian 3.0 (2.4.18-bf2.4). I have tried all
sorts of kernel settings. Since I have got it to work before I think should
be able to do it again.
Please advise.  
/Nicke

Hello,
Is the Promise raid configured as a raid0 stripe? If so, can you see in the
boot messages if, when the ataraid driver detects the drives it is only
detecting one of the drives? Have you recently added or replaced one of the
drives?
If the ataraid driver only detects one of the drives in a raid0 array, you
might try this patch:

I diffed it against 2.4.21 but it should still apply. HTH,
