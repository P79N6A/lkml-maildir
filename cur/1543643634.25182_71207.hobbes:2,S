while the general problem is certainly halting-problem level of
complexity, there's a much more simple problem which amounts to string
matching.  the simple problem is "is this a specific portion of openssl /
cryptoapi / whatever?"
if you consider a technology like transmeta's which only has to
compile/translate code infrequently (rather than a traditional technology
with decoders running all the time) then it's pretty easy to see how you
could use a few cycles to do the string matching.
people have been doing this in compilers for years, where the string
matching question is "is this part of SPECCPU?"
