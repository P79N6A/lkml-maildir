My question is its 'value'.  The entry in /etc/asound.state should
have a boolean value.
Let me repeat the explanation of the situation:
The existence of 'Headphone Jack Sense' and 'Line-in Jack Sense'
controls themselves are not the problem.  If they are set off, the
behavior of the driver must be identical with the older version.
No regression. The patch I mentionted turns off them as default unless
the device is known to work.  But the controls still exist, and you
can change them afterward manually.
So, the solution is once to turn off these controls via a mixer and
save the state via alsactl (usually the system does at shutdown), so
that the correct states are restored at the next reboot.  That's why I
asked you - to check the saved status of these controls.
If the correct values are saved there and still the problem exists,
someone else must have changed the mixer status.  For example, KDE
(kmix) seems to set up the mixer status by itself, and does not always
correctly.  That was my suspect.  I don't know GNOME does something
like that, too.
