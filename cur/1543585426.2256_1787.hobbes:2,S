Ok, it just dawned on me...
if we update jiffies_p every time we update jiffies, it stands to reason
that they will always be equal... soooo... we can eliminate the need for
that check, and hence, the variable.
Since we are open to this problem from 10ms after the last call to
gettimeoffset to the time that interrupts are enabled, we should be
significantly better off.
We still have a race, just smaller....Updating count_p twice per jiffie
should eliminate the problem in practice (though in theory, we still
have a race.)  Errrm...  ????
Questions, comments, etc?
