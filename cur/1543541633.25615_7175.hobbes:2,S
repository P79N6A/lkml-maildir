I patched 2.4.0-test6-pre2 with AGP detection support for the VIA KX133
chipset. It seems to boot up okay to recognize the device, AGP aperature, and
allocates the memory structures for it. However, I don't have an AGP card at
this time to test out if it really works or not. I'm getting a Matrox G400 MAX
in two days, so hopefully I can play with it a little then.
Anyways, try 2.4.0-test6 (final) and see if that works for ya.
