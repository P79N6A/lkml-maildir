I can't help putting in a plug for SRCU, which is in the 2.6.19-rc series,
and which allows readers to sleep.  (
http://lwn.net/Articles/202847/
)
SRCU allows readers and writers to run concurrently (as do all forms of
RCU).  If this is a problem, it might be worth looking into Gautham
Shenoy's reader-writer lock built on top of RCU.  (A version for hotplug
may be found at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/73.
)  This approach
keeps the reader-writer-lock semantics, but gets rid of cache thrashing.
That said, writers have to wait for a grace period.
And as Linus pointed out, if you have disk I/O involved, you probably
won't notice normal reader-writer-lock overhead.
