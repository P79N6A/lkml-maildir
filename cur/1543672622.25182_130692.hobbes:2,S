No, No. That is a process stack. Every process has it's own, entirely
seperate stack. This stack is used only in user mode. The kernel has
it's own stack. Every time you switch to kernel mode either by
calling the kernel or by a hardware interrupt, the kernel's stack
is used.
When a task sleeps, it sleeps in kernel mode. The kernel schedules
other tasks until the sleeper has been satisfied either by time or
by event.
