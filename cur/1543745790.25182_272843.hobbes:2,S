OK then put a touch_nmi_watchdog in there if you must.

Your point was that touch_nmi_watchdog() which resets alert_counter,
is racy when resetting the counter of other CPUs. Yes it is racy.
It is also racy against the NMI on the _current_ CPU.
This has nothing whatsoever to do with NMIs racing against themselves,
I don't know how you got that idea when you were the one to bring up
this race anyway.
[ snip back-and-forth that is going nowhere ]
I'll bow out of the argument here. I grant you raise valid concens
WRT the /proc issues, of course.
