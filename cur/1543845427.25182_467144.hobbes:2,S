It doesn't matter much because these days this stuff is all out of lined
anyways and in a single function. And the dynamic branch predictor
in all modern CPUs will usually cache the decision (unlocked) there.
(Actually there is something dumb  left -- on a non preempt kernel
spin_unlock caller is larger than doing it inline. But that is left
for fixing later)

Unfortunately Linux is a lot more complex than it was in the early days.

I thought for a long time we didn't need it either, but these days with all 
these callbacks in some parts of the kernel (driver model, others) and you 
get a oops with 60+ entries it is just too much trouble to figure it out manually.
I admit when I took the code I didn't realize that dwarf2 has these
problems (not supporting out of line sections is clearly a spec
bug and would even hit gcc generated code). But we don't have 
that many out of line sections anyways, so it's not that big an issue. 
And all the people who process a lot of oopses (e.g. Andrew, Ingo, others) tend
to use frame pointers by default anyways. They already voted with their feet.
And the unwinder certainly gives better code than frame pointers. The mispredicted
branches you're worrying about are nothing against frame pointers 
(e.g. on K8 FP tends to stall the CPU on each function call slightly)
Anyways, in theory it would be possible to keep the out of line sections
and define some own dwarf2 extension that allows us to express them.
Jan might have some thoughts on it. But I didn't think it was worth
it for these cases due to the reasons above.
