Thanks for the pointers, guys.  It took a while for me to figure out what
got wrong to foul up UML, but the bug and fix are trivial (posting now).
Some of the testing I thought had got done clearly wasn't done, since
PTRACE_SETREGS was 100% busticated for 32-bit processes calling ptrace on
x86_64 kernels.
Thanks,
Roland
