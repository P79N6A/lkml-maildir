I certainly understood your intent and agree that confirmation is necessary. I was venting some
frustration at it taking nearly 3 weeks to get a fix into the system for a bug that was caused by a
change in an kernel structure that was not our doing. When Andrew posted a trial patch to fix the
compilation error that resulted, I immediately responded with the two additional fixes that were
needed, but they never made it into the code. Since then I have been seeing these obscure bug
reports and quickly learned that if either softmac or bcm43xx WX were involved, this fix took care
of the problem.
