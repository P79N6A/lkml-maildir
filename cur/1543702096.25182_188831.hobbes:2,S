Yeah, I noticed that upon looking over sd.c et all.
It seems this iRiver player reports incorrectly that it is removable,
since the protocol used by usb-stoareg for this device is
transparent_scsi, thus all the info is fed directly from the device to
the scsi layer.
I have added a new flag for SCSI devices that need special treatment,
and the "iRiver" "iFP Mass Driver"  to the list of those devices with
that new flag. this way nothing is broken to support the iRiver.
However, since this is not a real SCSI device, shouldn't this be
transparently fixed by usb-storage instead? Or is it ok this way?
