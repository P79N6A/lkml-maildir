Subject: [PATCH] [CLEANUP] radeonfb accelerator id in 2.4.19
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This small patch assigns an accelerator id to radeonfb.
The reason for this should be obvious.
This is against 2.4.19-pre6, but making it apply against
something else shouldnt be a lot of work ;)
I read LKML, but not fbdev-devel.
