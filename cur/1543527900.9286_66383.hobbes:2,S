Micro$Thief machines, on a network of say 10.100.x.x -> 10.400.x.x, ARP
all of the addresses every 10 seconds. When you have a 1000 of these
machines, you end up with continuous ARP...ing and the network becomes
unusable.
Also, machine performance suffers:
Here is a build of some software with the network connected.

Here is the same build with the network wire disconnected. This is a
SMP machine (hense the 104%CPU).

So it's 27 seconds of wall-clock time if I connect the network, 24
seconds if I don't. This is after-hours!  In the middle of the day,
I've seen the ratio of 2:1!
Micro$Thief isn't just grabbing an apple now an then. They are destroying
the nature of the Personal Computer. They have changed a Personal Computer
into a "Personal Communications Device". They perform this communications
by disrupting the network neighborhood, much like having a neighbor
that communicates by using bomb-bursts. And, they do all this by
stealing my CPU time to dump their corrupt packets on the floor.
In the meantime, their fraudulent advertising and other business practices
make it quite difficult to use a Personal Computer for Computing in the
work-place. We have a new generation of know-nothing, do-nothing, so-called
engineers, bred into the M$Thief world, who convince management that they
can't do their work until all the Unix/Linux machines are purged from the
world.
Because of the defective performance produced by M$Thief machines,
the lack of productivity is being blamed upon Network hackers. This
has caused the environment of, say 1000 users, to be something like:
o	10	Security Administrators.
o	10	System Adminstrators.
o      940	Micro$Thief users downloading porno
o	30	Engineers getting technical info from Web Pages
o	10	Engineers trying to write code.
It should be obvious that the same amount of work could be done as:
o	10	Engineers trying to write code.
o	30	Engineers getting technical info from Web Pages
These don't need Micro$Thief. They also don't need:
o	10	Security Administrators.
o	10	System Adminstrators.
