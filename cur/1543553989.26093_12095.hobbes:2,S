No oops, but right after I installed test11-pre1, then tried to
access a Windows box as a VNC client, this message started
getting continuously dumped by syslog:

eth0 seems OK, I regularly check ifconfig after installing a new
kernel:
===
$ /sbin/ifconfig -a
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:D0:B7:7A:00:B0
          inet addr:172.16.1.3  Bcast:172.16.1.255

Doing a Yahoo search it seems this was previously reported
eepro100 bug, which appears to have resurfaced.
FWIW, Bob L.
