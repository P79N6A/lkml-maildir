Can't you pretty much get the drive to check itself using smartctl, such 
as running:
     smartctl -o on -s on -S on /dev/hde &> /dev/null
in an init script?  Also, I think if you just happen to write to a bad 
sector the drive will remap it without a warning (unless it doesn't have 
any remapping sectors left), but if you read from it then to get the 
drive to "notice" it, you have to write back to that sector.  Or run the 
drive test which should find it and correct it.

I think he's using reiserfs on the partition, which ASFAIK doesn't 
support marking bad sectors without some work.  I tend to agree with 
namesys when they suggest just getting a new drive if it has used up all 
of its extra sectors.  In my experience (admittedly limited), any drive 
which runs out of extra sectors starts to go bad in a hurry.
