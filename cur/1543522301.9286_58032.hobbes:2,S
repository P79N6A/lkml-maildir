I am the official maintainer of usb-scsi.  I am aware of the problem.  A
patch which restores functionality should be available later this week.
Right now, I'm in the middle of a major cleanup and re-design which is
bringing to light many, many bugs in the old system.
Also, for USB related discussions, please keep them on linux-usb@suse.com.
For usb-scsi (soon to be renamed usb-storage) issues, please e-mail me
directly.  My e-mail address in in the usb-scsi files, and is
mdharm-usb@one-eyed-alien.net
