It scares me a bit, too.

I think we should start with string-based interface, with just two
states ("on" and "off"). That is easily extensible into future, and
suits current PCMCIA nicely. It also allows us to experiment with PCI
power management... I can cook up a patch, but it will be simple
reintroduction of .../power file under different name.
