Well sure, you can work around this bug on your particular machine, but I
can't do the same because then, unlike your machine where not enough devices
are enabled for wake, *too many* devices will be enabled for wake on some
machines. This results in them not turning off properly -- they come right
back on. ;-)
So, there is a general-purpose fix for this, it just is going to take more
than deleting one line.
