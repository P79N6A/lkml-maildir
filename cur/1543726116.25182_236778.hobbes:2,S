Can you reproduce this by cat'ing /proc/<pid>/cmdline?  Can you get a
dump of the proc cmdline file to leak the environment sometimes?
It is this file that 'ps' is dumping for these options.  Adding the
'e' option would also dump the /proc/<pid>/environ file (if readable).
But you aren't adding 'e', so presumably the environment is "leaking"
into the the cmdline file.
I suspect a kernel bug here - the ps code seems rather obvious and
unimpeachable.
