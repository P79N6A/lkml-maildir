Well, if motorola was so stupid that you can kill it by mistake... I
don't want to touch _that_.

On mainboards I saw it was in 'reasonable' range. I trust it not to
melt cpu before thermal diode does its job.
AMD's PowerNow at least will not let you overclock and/or
overvoltage. You are free to undervoltage, but that's crash-only.
Its true that HP Omnibook xe3 probably can be damaged, provided that
its CPU fan fails and there's just enough airflow to keep thermal
protection from kicking in. Its harddrive overheats in such case.
I guess that's uncommon enough.
