Sure.  But Linus saing that he doesn't want more of that (shit, crap,
I don't rember what he said exactly) in the kernel is a very good reason
for thinking a little more aboyt it.
Espescially if most arguments look right to one after thinking more about
it...

True.  The arument that they are to heaviweight also.
That they should allow scatter gather without an array of structs also.

Right.  That's what the new design was about, besides adding a offset and
length to every page instead of the page array, something also wanted by
the networking in the first place.
Look at the skb_frag struct in the zero-copy patch for what networking
thinks it needs for physical page based buffers.

From looking at the networking code and listening to Dave and Ingo it looks
like it makes the thing better for networking, although I can not verify
this due to the lack of familarity with the networking code.
For disk I/O it makes the handling a little easier for the cost of the
additional offset/length fields.

P.S. the tuple things is also what Larry had in his inital slice paper.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
