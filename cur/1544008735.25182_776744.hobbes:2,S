The spec says that PIO mode 0 is supported, but Sergei is correct --
the maximum values give a cycle time of 480 ns.  How can this be?  The
old driver appeared to have tried to support PIO mode 0 by setting to
the maximum.
  Which fast timing bits are documented as reserved?  My spec has the
IDE Drive 0/1 Recovery Time and IDE Drive 0/1 Pulse Width bits in it.
Are there other timing bits that aren't documented in my spec?
  Please excuse my dumb question -- I'm a little over my head here.
