That would only work for cases where the kernel isn't responsible for
the actual bus numbering/renumbering. For example, since we do not quite
deal with PCI domains yet, I have to force pcibios_assign_all_busses()
on pmac so that my 3 root busses get re-numbered (else I get 3 trees
with conflicting bus numbers all starting at 0). Another case is embedded
which can deal with completely unassigned bus numbers.
