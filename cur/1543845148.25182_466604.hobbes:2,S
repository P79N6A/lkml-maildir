 ---------------------------
 
+What:	/sys/devices/.../power/state
+	dev->power.power_state
+	dpm_runtime_{suspend,resume)()
+When:	July 2007
+Why:	Broken design for runtime control over driver power states, confusing
+	driver-internal runtime power management with:  mechanisms to support
+	system-wide sleep state transitions; event codes that distinguish
+	different phases of swsusp "sleep" transitions; and userspace policy
+	inputs.  This framework was never widely used, and most attempts to
+	use it were broken.  Drivers should instead be exposing domain-specific
+	interfaces either to kernel or to userspace.
+Who:	Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
+
+---------------------------
+
 What:	RAW driver (CONFIG_RAW_DRIVER)
 When:	December 2005
 Why:	declared obsolete since kernel 2.6.3
