Attached is a patch to the sata_nv driver that accounts for a few
differences between the nForce3 and CK804/MCP04 SATA controllers.
A minor change to libata-core.c needs to accompany this patch.  This is
in regards to the function ata_pci_remove_one(), where the
host_set->ops->host_stop(host_set) needs to occur before the
iounmap(host_set->mmio_base).  This is because sata_nv's host_stop
callback needs access to the iomapped region.
