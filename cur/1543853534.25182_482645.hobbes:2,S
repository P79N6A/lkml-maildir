Why do we need to have them at all? Devices should not "move" in the
trees - it it moves we should just treat them as old devices going
away and new devices appearing... Renames - they are only used to
rename net devices, don't they? I wonder if we could have just a
separate "alias" or "name" sysfs attribute for them and get away with
renaming of devices.
