   Somebody please recheck Config in about NLS. ISOFS has different
   condition than other FS'es IIRC (noticed it in test7-pre5 smb nls
   support patch).
While updating the Linux 2.4 issues list (a new updated list will be out
shortly), it looks like this item has still not been addressed.  To
whomever is maintainning the NLS, ISOFS, FAT, and SMBFS filesystems: 
(I wasn't able to identify maintainers for all of these)
ISOFS ignores CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT, and hardcodes the use of iso8859-1 as
the default.  Is this the correct behaviour?
The FAT and SMBFS filesystems will fail to compile of CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT
is not defined which will be the case if the user answers "no" to
CONFIG_NLS question.  I assume there should be some better fallbacks for
this case?
