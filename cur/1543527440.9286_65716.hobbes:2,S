Great!  I'm definitely interested in seeing this too.

Well, I'm sure that the framebuffer will get worked out in
time... My only, and I stress _only_ here goal - to satisfy my
personal itch - is to have the _TEXT_MODE_ hardware utilized in a
more powerful way.
I am interested in fb devices too, but not at the expense of
dumping perfectly good text mode hardware that is underutilized.

Correct me if I'm wrong... fbdev consists of only graphical
devices, and not text mode hardware?  I just want to get it
straight because a lot of people are telling me about fbdev and
I'm not entirely clear on it.  None of the links people have sent
me mention anything at all about text mode, only graphical fb
consoles.  Again, I think graphical console is a cool thing, but
my personal area of concern here is the actual VGA text
console.  I want to snazzy it up a bit, and have it remain as
compatible as  possible at the same time.

Will do!  Looks like there are a lot of people wanting to
contribute to a better console here!
Take care!
