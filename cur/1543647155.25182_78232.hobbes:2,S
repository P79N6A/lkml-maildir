The 2.4.17 was the standard-kernel without any patches, the 2.4.18 and
2.4.19 as well. Unfortunately I don't have the .config-file for the
2.4.17 anymore, so I can't tell the configuration-difference between
the two. Is there a way to find out the configuration of a kernel?
One thing that came to my mind: Is the problem probably related to the
fact that with 2.4.18/19 my computer won't suspend anymore? It blanks
the screen but doesn't beep and then resumes immediately normally as
the log-file says. When I boot the 2.4.17 everything works as expected.
Thanx a lot in advance
yours
