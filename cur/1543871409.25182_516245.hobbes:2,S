That's true for *any* sprintf(), though.  sprintf() converts all its 
arguments to 64 bits.
However, this could be optimized.  I think right now sprintf() uses a 
generic divide-by-base, but a divide by 8 and 16 can of course be 
handled with a shift, and divide by 10 can be replaced with a 
multiplication by 0x1999999999999999ULL on most architectures.
