Sure.  The same machine is under there, whichever language you use;
you always have to know what's going on under the hood if optimal
performance is the goal.  None of this is an argument against C++ per
se, particularly if you just choose to use its 'better C' subset.

C++ is *not* less efficient.  It can't be, seeing as how it's
almost[*] a proper superset of C, so there's nothing about the C
subset that prevents just-as-good code generation.
[*] modulo added keywords and obscure points like typeof('c').
