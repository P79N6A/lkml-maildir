CONFIG_EMBEDDED is _not_ a generic "advanced user" option, it's only for 
options that allow additional space savings.
What you could actually do would be
config UNIX
	bool "Unix domain sockets" if EMBEDDED
	default y
since as the help text already says everything other than Y is expected 
to cause problems - and if people know they are in a space limited 
environment and really don't need it they'll still be able to disable it.
As a bonus, making it a bool would allow to make the kernel image 
slightly smaller for everyone.
