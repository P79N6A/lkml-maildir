No, NCQ can reorder although I recently heard that windows issues
overlapping NCQ commands and expects them to be processed in order (what
were they thinking?).
The biggest difference between TCQ and NCQ is that TCQ is for SCSI while
NCQ is for ATA.  Functional difference includes more number of available
tags and ordered tags for TCQ.  The former doesn't matter for single
disk.  The latter may make some difference but on single disk not by much.

Port multiplier is a switch too.  It doesn't broadcast anything and
definitely has forwarding buffers inside.  An allegory which makes more
sense is expander to router and port multiplier to switch.  Unless you
wanna nest them, they aren't that different.
