Hello,
I have released two new PPSkits at the usual place (linux.kernel.org
/pub/linux/daemons/ntp/PPS): PPSkit-0.3.10 for Linux 2.0.36, and
PPSkit-0.6-pre7.diff.gz, based on Linux 2.2.1.
First, for the 0.6 release. I consider this patch as the famous "final"
version, and I'm planning to release PPSkit-0.6.0 soon.  It works for i386
architecture just fine, and I did not get any feedback from other
architectures. Therefore I assume its working (OK, just kidding)!
Second for the PPSkit-0.3.10: It just contains the proposed bug fixes:
                           NEWS for 0.3.10
+ As the code seems usable, and Linux 2.0 won't change a lot now, this
  probably will be the last release for PPSkit-0.3.
+ Updated ``enable_pps.c'' from the PPSkit-0.6 snapshot (don't miss
  pulses when monitoring jitter).
+ Merged another bug fix from the PPSkit-0.6 snapshot.  This fixes a
  memory leak associated with ``CIOGETEV'' as well as a possible race
  condition.
