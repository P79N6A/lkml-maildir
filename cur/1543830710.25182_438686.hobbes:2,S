Sorry, I was thinking static means "I may inline". And indeed, my
compiler says this:
init/main.c: In function 'smp_init':
init/main.c: At top level:
init/main.c:457: error: weak declaration of 'smp_setup_processor_id' must be public
init/main.c:457: error: static declaration of 'smp_setup_processor_id' follows non-static declaration
include/linux/smp.h:128: error: previous declaration of 'smp_setup_processor_id' was here
Making it non-static in init/main.c fixes this
I'm still compiling, so might have the results later this evening.
