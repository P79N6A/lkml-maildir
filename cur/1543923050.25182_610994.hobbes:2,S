You have created a raid 0+1, raid10 is a different thing. Given your 
setup, raid10 is probably what you *should* have created.

Hardware error, almost certainly. If you're using a hub, I suspect that

order of likelyhood.

Do you ever get errors in partitions which are not part of the raid0+1 
setup, like md1? If not, look at your partition tables to see if you 
have any strange values there.
Are all drives at the same firmware level?
