I have a déjà-vu, and I do believe that this discussion has taken place
in this list before, perhaps with a slightly different alignment, and
likely in the context of mail transfer agents and perhaps synchronous
directory (data) updates (file creation and such). Exposing a bit of the
queueing to the user space through new syscalls may be an interesting
experiment, although I do not have the resources to provide code.
Something like fsync() that doesn't flush the whole file system (which
appears to be the most common implementation) but tracks what is needed,
and that returns when data for a given file is on disk.

Naming suggestion: flazysync()
