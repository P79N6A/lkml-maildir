Subject: problem about CLONE_PARENT_SETTID | CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID ?

When I read create_thread() in NPTL source code, it passes
CLONE_PARENT_SETTID 
| CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID to sys_clone(). However, in arch/arm/kernel/sys_arm.c
(sys_clone) [kernel 2.5.49]
256         if (clone_flags & (CLONE_PARENT_SETTID | CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID))
257                 return -EINVAL;
 I have searched CLONE_PARENT_SETTID in kernel, it seems only to appear in 
some non-architecture files, such as /include/linux/sched.h and several arch
files,
 but they do little about wrapping.  Why ARM can't support 
(CLONE_PARENT_SETTID | CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID)? 
any comments? thanks a lot.
