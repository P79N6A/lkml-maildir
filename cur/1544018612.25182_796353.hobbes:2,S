Ah yes ok that's right. But then you don't get LIFO allocation

But in those cases would be expected to be encountered if that slab
is not used as frequently, ergo less performance critical. And
ones that are used frequently should be more likely to have recently
freed cache hot objects.

OK, but how much does that help?

Yeah. In my experience I haven't needed to optimise this type of behaviour
yet, but other allocators could definitely do similar things to switch their
queues to different nodes.

SLQB's page lists typically get accessed eg. 1% of the time (sometimes far
less, other workloads more). So it is several orders of magnitude removed
from the fastpath which is handled by the freelist.
So I think it is wrong to say it requires more metadata handling. SLUB
will have to switch pages more often or free objects to pages other than
the "fast" page (what do you call it?), so quite often I think you'll
find SLUB has just as much if not more metadata handling.
