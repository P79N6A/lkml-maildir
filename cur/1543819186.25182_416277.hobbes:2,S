Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Remove redundant NULL checks before [kv]free
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here's another round of [kv]free NULL check cleanup patches.
A few CodingStyle cleanups crept in as well while I was in the area.
This time I think I got all of them (or at least all my script found).
If someone wants to take a look at this in the future and want to use the
small PHP script I used to find these, then it should be available at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/juhl/scripts/find_kvfree.php
 
shortly (at least I've put it on master.kernel.org, so I assume it'll get 
out there soon).
