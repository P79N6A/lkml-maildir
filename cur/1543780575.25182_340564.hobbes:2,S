OK, I think that will still be slightly confusing becuase it comes
before Sound in the kernel config, but maybe the deprecated part will

I think we should at least label these clearly as part of OSS.  Users at
least seem to know that mixing OSS and ALSA modules is bad.

OK.  I'm almost positive there is no functionality missing, there have
not been any reports of people needing to use the OSS driver on any of
the ALSA lists.
