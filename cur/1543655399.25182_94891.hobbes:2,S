I think this can be a good idea, but in some cases, like the set_rx_mode
routines (multicast) it depends on the conversion to long, so those ones
should be dealt with in a different fashion, BTW, I haven't touched those
ones.

Lets see:
o drivers/atm/ambassador.c (ChangeSet@1.797.108.1)
o drivers/atm/horizon.c (ChangeSet@1.797.108.2)
o drivers/char/sx.c (ChangeSet@1.797.108.3)
o drivers/net/lance.c (ChangeSet@1.831.1.15)
o drivers/net/ni65.c (ChangeSet@1.797.108.8)
o drivers/net/dl2k.c (ChangeSet@1.831.1.34, ChangeSet@1.831.1.32)
o drivers/net/wan/sdla_fr.c (ChangeSet@1.831.1.41)
o include/linux/if_wanpipe_common.h (ChangeSet@1.831.1.42)
only sets/resets/tests a few bits, safe, no code depends on it changing
its size from 32 to 64 bits.
Humm, I was expecting a second type of changes, but I think all are safe,
even on a second glance. :-)
