See opinions about APIs are strictly personal. IMO kqueue is overbloated
for example. The epoll API is extremely easy to use and very much remember
the poll one, that many developers are used to. If you want to make your
software completely abstract, you can use Niels's libevent library for
example, that supports poll/select/epoll/kqueue.
