dmesg on booting a 2.6.17.7 kernel on the HP NW9440 laptop reports:
 > PCI: Bus #03 (-#06) is hidden behind transparent bridge #02 (-#03) (try 'pci=assign-busses')
 > Please report the result to linux-kernel to fix this permanently
I'm not quite sure which part of the dmesg output I'm supposed to
report.  When I enable pci=assign-busses, the piece of dmesg that
reports the warning says nothing, but later on in dmesg where it is
printing out information about busses, it says:
 > PCI: Bus 6, cardbus bridge: 0000:05:06.0
 >   IO window: 00006000-000060ff
 >   IO window: 00006400-000064ff
 >   PREFETCH window: 88000000-89ffffff
 >   MEM window: 8a000000-8bffffff
Instead of PCI: Bus 3, ...
I didn't notice anything else changing.  If I should run some other
command or provide other output, tell me what to run and I'll report
the output.
Please CC me directly since I'm not subscribed to linux-kernel.
