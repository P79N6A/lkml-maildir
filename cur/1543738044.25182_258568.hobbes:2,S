Which feature are you concerned over, the additional hook or the
new module?  The module is a no-op for anybody who doesn't want it.
I can't vouch for the number of users of this module although I've seen
some positive feedback from users.  One nice bit is that it goes a way
towards helping vserver which does have quite a few users.  This module
really demonstrates one of the points of LSM...to support multiple
security models.
