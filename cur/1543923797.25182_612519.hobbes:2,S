It's initialized from board_info, yes.  Drivers can override it
using spi_setup().
One would expect they only override _downwards_ but that's not
guaranteed anywhere.  A driver might have a way to establish that
this particular board can run faster, for example.

Certainly; all spi_transfer records come from applications!
If that value is zero, that transfer segment uses the limit
from the spi_device ... otherwise, it can differ.  Again,
the limits can vary based on devise characteristics; maybe
it can't feed data as fast for some commands.
(ISTR the M25P16 in $SUBJECT has two read commands, one of
which is only usable at clock rates below 33 MHz or so, but
most other commands can work above that speed just fine.)
