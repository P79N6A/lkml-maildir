setcolreg does that for directcolor and truecolor modes, because they're
the only ones that uses the pseudo_palette.  See all driver codes, the
pseudo_palette is never initialized if in pseudo_color.
The purpose of the pseudo_palette is to enable to write pixels to the
framebuffer without knowing the color format at all.  So, if you have
monochrome, then black is 0 and white is 1.  But for monochrome 8bpp,
black is 0 and white is 0xff. 
fbcon will send 0's and 1's, thus 0 and 1 will be written to the
framebuffer.  If the drawing functions referred to the pseudo_palette,
whatever the visual format, then 0 and 0xff will be written, as it
should be.
