After cursory examination of proftpd, it appears that there is a misuse of the
sendfile() call under Linux, which may be responsible for the corruption.  The
code was originally based on BSD semantics.  Under Linux, the offset argument
is not being used correctly to determine how much data has been sent in the
case of EINTR.
A patch will be coming out soon, as it is a fairly trivial fix.
