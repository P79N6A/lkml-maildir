One real problem is that you are trying to do in the kernel what would 
be best done in the application and better done in glibc... Because the 
benefit of readahead varies based on fd rather than device. Consider a 
program reading data from a file and putting it in a database. The 
benefit of readahead for the sequential access data file is higher than 
seek-read combinations. The library could do readahead based on the 
bytes read since the last seek on a by-file basis, something the kernel 
can't.
This is not to say the kernel work hasn't been a benefit, but note that 
with all the patches 2.4 still seems to outperform 2.6. And that's a 
problem since other parts of 2.6 scale so well. I do see that 2.4 seems 
to outperform 2.6 for usenet news, where you have small reads against a 
modest database, a few TB or so, and 400-2000 processes doing random 
reads against the data. Settings and schedulers seem to have only modest 
effect there.
