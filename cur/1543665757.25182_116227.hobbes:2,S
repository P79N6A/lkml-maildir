Hi all
This is a followup to my previous message regarding a consistant
reproducable oops under 2.4.20 when burning CDs using cdrecord and ide-scsi.
Last night I tried disabling DMA on the CD drive (it was enabled by
default):
  hdparm -d0 -c1 /dev/hdc
Following this, two dummy writes (700MB and 680MB respectively) proceeded
normally and completed without errors.  Given that under 2.4.20 the dummy
writes usually failed very quickly (after around 7-30MB), it would appear
that in the first instance at least, DMA must be disabled for ide-scsi CD
writers under 2.4.20 in order for burning to be reliable.
Obviously this isn't the intended behaviour though; is anyone aware of this
issue and/or is it being worked on for 2.4/2.5 as appropriate?
Best regards
  jonathan
