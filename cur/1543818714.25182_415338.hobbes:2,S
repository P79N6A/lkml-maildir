Sorry I don't understand what you mean. Why do you say it's not fair (got a 
testcase?). What do you mean by "definitely not smooth". What is smoothness 
and on what workloads is it not smooth? Also by ia you mean what?

Again I don't understand. Just how heavy a load is heavy? Your testcases are 
already in what I would call stratospheric range. I don't personally think a 
cpu scheduler should be optimised for load infinity. And how are you defining 
efficient? You say it doesn't "look" efficient? What "looks" inefficient 
about it?

Looks? How? You've shown what I consider very long runqueues work fine 
already.

I think over all meaningful loads, and into absurdly high load ranges it 
works. I don't think undoing the incredible simplicity that works over all 
that range should be done to optimise for loads even greater than that.

You want tunables? The only tunable in staircase is rr_interval which (in -ck) 
has an on/off for big/small (sched_compute) since most other numbers in 
between (in my experience) are pretty meaningless. I could export rr_interval 
directly instead... I've not seen a good argument for doing that. Got one? 
However there are no other tunables at all (just look at the code). All tasks 
of any nice level have available the whole priority range from 100-139 which 
appears as PRIO 0-39 on top. Limiting that (again) changes the semantics.

And another round of thanks :) But many more questions.
