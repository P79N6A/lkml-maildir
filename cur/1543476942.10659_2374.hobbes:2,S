unless you live with other folks who don't always get the leave the T
plugged
in bit.  Which is why I finally went to an 8-port hub (cost me about $50
on
onsale).  I can home from a vacation to a rude network situation.  My
roomate had unplugged his machine the wrong way (left an open end)
and had disabled my internet servers (which btw, linux boxes are not --
at least they didn't use to be -- happy with an NFS server going down
and staying down for a week)
With UTP, just the machine would have been down, my two internet servers
would have
still been able to talk to each other.

Of course, I'm now on a switch (6 100Mbit, 8 10Mbit ports).  Got it
indirect through a surplus auction new for under $300.  the linux
machines are now really happy (amazing what cheap PCI DEC chipset 10/100 
-- about $25 a piece -- do for performance, dropping CPU overhead)
