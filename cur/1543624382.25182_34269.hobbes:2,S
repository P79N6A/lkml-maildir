I agree that a separate interface would be better, one that guarantees to
handle exceptions on the m68k and other archs with separate address spaces too.
I use that facility quite regularly in architecture specific code, sorry
for letting it slip into portable code. 
I guess set_fs(KERNEL_DS); __*_user() will not catch exceptions on m68k
currently, right?
