That just sounds like the journal updating... the default journal time is 5 
seconds. Try transiently disabling the journal to see if that's it:
mount -o remount,noload /mountpoint
Don't forget to re-enable it afterwards.
You could set laptop mode if the writeouts are too frequent for your liking:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode
-- 
-ck
