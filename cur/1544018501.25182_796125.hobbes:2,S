Following the lengthy discussion, largely for my benefit, I'm now
looking at the patch with some idea of sensibility.
It seems to me that when setting sbi->oz_pgrp we should use
task_pgrp_vnr(). As Oleg says, and I agree, this should always give
correct results when checking if current is the session leader.
But I think that for debug logging we should always report numbers that
correspond to the object as it is seen in the global namespace as that
is the most likely reference point someone examining debug logging will
be working from.
Oleg, what should be the recommended call to report that, instead of the
task_pgrp_nr() call?
