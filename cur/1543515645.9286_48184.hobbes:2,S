It's also shared by the uhci device (part of the USB stuff I think).

This could be an MPS-1.4 table parsing bug, but regardless, the situation is
clear.  The uhci device and the aic7xxx device are sharing the same interrupt
pin even though linux doesn't think so and as a result we are seeing infinite
interrupts on INT19 as the hardware is trying to get the uhci driver to handle
some condition (and likely the uhci driver is waiting on those interrupts as
well and is likewise frustrated about not getting them).
