It still should do software tap emulation (although support is a bit flakey
with ALPS I must admit, but there are patches that should improve it) - so
people who don't like tapping can deactivate it.
Anyway, "psmouse.proto=exps" boot option should disable ALPS native mode and
restore previous behavior.
