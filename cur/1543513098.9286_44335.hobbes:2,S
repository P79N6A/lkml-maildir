I'm work on an implementation of a predictive prefetching method in
Linux.  I've got a situation where I'm quite able to predict what will
occur next with a high degree of accuracy, but am finding that the
prefetches that I'm queuing  (using brw_page (READ,xxxx)) are causing
the demand driven I/O requests to take a good bit longer.
What I would like to set up do is prefetch using some sort of low
priority preemptable I/O request, such that any demand driven I/O
request would interrupt these low priority prefetch requests.
Is there a simple way to do this?
