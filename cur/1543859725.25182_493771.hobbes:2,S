I am assuming that your program is not seeking inbetween writes.
Try disabling the Disk Cache, now-a-days some disks can have as much
as 8MB write cache. so the disk might be buffering as much as it can,
and trying to write only when it can no longer buffer. Since you have
an app which continously write copious amounts of data, in order,
disabling write cache might make some sense.
