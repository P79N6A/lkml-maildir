Just to get back to the point of consistant naming: In case we do the
other proposed changes as well, is everyone happy with the following
function names?
cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_X)	cur_cpu_spec->cpu_features & CPU_FTR_X
cpu_feature_possible(CPU_FTR_X)	CPU_FTR_POSSIBLE_MASK & CPU_FTR_X
fw_has_feature(FW_FEATURE_X)	cur_cpu_spec->fw_features & FW_FTR_X
platform_is(PLATFORM_X)		systemcfg->platform == PLATFORM_X
platform_possible(PLATFORM_X)	PLATFORM_POSSIBLE_MASK & PLATFORM_X
platform_compatible(PLATFORM_X)	systemcfg->platform & PLATFORM_X
It's not as consistant as I'd like it to be, but it's the best I could
come up with.
