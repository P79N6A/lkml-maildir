Manual page 'man 2 fork' says:
                  'File locks ... are not inherited.'
This is true for POSIX locks (fcntl-style locks).
But flock-style locks (aka bsd-style locks) are not inherited across
fork, correct ?
Would not it be more helpful if fork manpage said:
         POSIX file locks(fcntl(2)) are not inherited.
         flock-style locks are inherited (see flock(2))
?
