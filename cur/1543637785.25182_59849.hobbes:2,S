Ingo Molnars patches for .17 and .18 worked
well for us, and did balance the ints load across all the CPUs very well.
You can find the patches I used agains 2.4.18 at
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/
BTW, this was on a production box for approximately one month,
then the box mysteriously crashed.  Due to the fact that our load wasn't
utilizing the hyperthreading that much I removed acpismp=force from the
boot string.
The are balanced across the 2 real CPUs.
