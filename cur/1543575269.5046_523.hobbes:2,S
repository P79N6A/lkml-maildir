I think flushing pages instead of buffers is a good direction to take.
Two things:
1. currently bdflush is setup to use page_launder only
   under memory pressure (if (free_shortage() ... )
   Do you think that it should call page_launder regardless?
2. There are two operations here:
	a. starting a write-back, periodically.
        b. freeing a page, which may involve taking the page
            out of a inode mapping, etc. IOW, what page_launder does.
   bdflush primarily does (a). If we want to move to page-oriented
   flushing, we atleast need extra information in the _page_ structure
   as to whether it is time to flush the page back.
