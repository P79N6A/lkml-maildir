Section 3, line 36 or so of my copy of POSIX draft 1003.1e gives:
I1 = I0
P1 = (Pf && X) || (If && I0)
E1 = Ef && P1
[where P0 is pP and p1 is pP']
Not sure how relevant this is, though.

I don't really see the point of fE in any case, but, since traditional POSIX 
apps have no concept of disables capabilities, I figured that all capabilities 
enabled should be the default.
In any case, it could be useful to use (=i) to mean "this process shouldn't use 
capabilities by default" or (=ip) to mean "this process is privileged, but it 
shouldn't use those privileges without knowing what it's doing".  Neither 
version seems to offer any real security benefit, but if (=i) were the default, 
then I don't see the benefit of (=ei).

fP (in my mind) means "this file gets these capabilities always" while fE means 
"if this file has these capabilities after exec evolution rules, then they 
should be enabled _unless they were already disabled."  I could easily be 
convinced that I'm wrong, though.

I don't think it really matters, but I changed my patch to be closer to the 
rules quoted above.  Remember that this draft is withdrawn.

I think this just changes the problem.  The POSIX rule (assuming my copy isn't 
bogus) gives pE = pP' & fE, which means that (if fE==0) any program that root 
wants to run with caps (most often CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE I presume) needs to either 
have fE explicitly set to full or be rewritten to enable its capabilities.  This 
breaks userspace.
