Well, to a first order of approximations, *all* northbridges have some 
sort of hardware registers to set mmconfig.  We were talking yesterday 
that it might just make more sense to have code for various northbridges 
to configure mmconfig directly, just like we do for IRQ routing (we 
can't trust the BIOS there, either.)
