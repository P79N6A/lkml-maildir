   I was actually proposing to provide a patch to an egcs version of your
   choice which you could provide as kgcc to your users.  But RH seem to
   have taken down the SRPM for 2.92.11 (egcs64-19980921-4.src.rpm).
The last sparc64 Red Hat distribution was 6.2  And it still works
unchanged with current kernels. :-)
