Is it "invalid" though? As a SCSI command, it seems perfectly valid to 
ask for less data than the total amount the drive could possibly send.
It's only when we have to translate it to an ATA command in libata that 
it becomes invalid there, right?
Are you saying that we should limit the SG_IO commands to only ones that 
are valid both as SCSI *and* as their ATA translations? Would that be 
for all SCSI devices, or just ones that libata backs?
