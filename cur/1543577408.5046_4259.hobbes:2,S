I wonder if Gnu Make 3.78.1 has the same problem?
I know of one bug in 3.78.1 where $(if ...) statements which have an
"else" clause screw up the parsing of the "else" clause.  But there
shouldn't be any $(if ...) constructs in the kernel Makefiles.
I guess we'll either have to find the problem and work around it,
or deprecate Gnu Make 3.78.
