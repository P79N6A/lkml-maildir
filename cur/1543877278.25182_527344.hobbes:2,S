The thing is, it's been broken for a long time -- this change just
highlighted it. This isn't the first time that device-mapper has moved
-- the introduction of mdp (before git, so haven't tracked down
timeframe) also moved it around. The dynamic major is not stable, so
should we be concerned if it moves for 2.6.21?
I don't like the effect it has on the backups, but I don't think we
should hand out LOCAL/EXP majors to dynamic devices, either. There is a
module option to make the device-mapper and mdp majors stable, so
perhaps a compromise is possible? Revert for 2.6.21, and schedule the
patch for later addition, which gives distros time to use the DM major
option?
