Subject: [patch] sched domain: increase the SMT busy rebalance interval
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

With SMT, if the logical processor is busy, load balance happens for every
8msec(min)-16msec(max). There is no need to do this often, as this is
just for fairness(to maintain uniform runqueue lengths) and default time slice
anyhow is 100msec.
Appended patch increases this interval to 64msec(min)-128msec(max) when the
logical processor is busy.
