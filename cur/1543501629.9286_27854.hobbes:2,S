That is incorrect: Test suites exist to ensure that the implementation
follows the design.  All kernel development aims to achieve a certain
goal.  Once you have that defined you can write test cases.  From then
on test cases will prevent that "fixes" or "enhancements" break the
documented design.

You claim that Linux has rapidly changing features:  prove it.
I think you can not do this, because the kernel features are not
changing, they are merely expanding.  So once a test for the behaviour
of a feature exists, this test will be useful until that feature
is dropped from the kernel.  How many kernel features do you know that
have been dropped from the kernel?  Without checking the kernel history,
i know of just three: callout-devices, extfs and kerneld.
