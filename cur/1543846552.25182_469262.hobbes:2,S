Still, it seems kind of odd to add this IMO. Especially the WARN_ON_ONCE
makes the if statement less readable.
   if (WARN_ON_ONCE(blah)) {
   }
What does that mean? Without looking at the implementation, that says
the condition is true at most once, when the warning is printed.
What's wrong with adding WARN and WARN_ONCE, and eating the single extra
line? You're always telling people to do that with assignments (which I
agree with, but are _more_ readable than this WARN_ON_ONCE thing).
