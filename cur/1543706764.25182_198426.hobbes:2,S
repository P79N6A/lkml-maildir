Spin-locks do work. However, you need to use the same lock-object
for each execution path. A common error is to do:
static spinlock_t device_lock;
... in one file, and...
static spinlock_t device_lock;
... in another...
There is also a possibility that the kernel you are using does not
impliment spin-locks if it's not compiled for SMP. To make sure,
compile your uniprocessor machine for SMP.
Basically, you use semaphores when the particular execution path
can sleep, and spin-locks when they can't. You can never sleep
in an ISR, so you need to use spin-lock protection where something
could change as a result of an interrupt.
