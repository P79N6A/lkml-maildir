In shrink_zone(), there is +1 logic that adds at least one to
nr_scan_active/nr_scan_inactive, and resets them to zero when they
have reached sc->swap_cluster_max (32 or higher in some cases).
So nr_scan_active/nr_scan_inactive will in most cases be 16
(SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX / 2), regardless of the size of the zone. So, a
total of 256 calls to shrink_zone() on a zone with 4096 pages will
likely scan through 100% of the pages on both LRU lists, while 256
calls to shrink_zone() on a zone with say 8096 pages will result in
around 50% of the pages on the lists are scanned through.
Maybe not entirely true, but the bottom line is that the +1 logic will
scan though smaller zones faster than large ones.
