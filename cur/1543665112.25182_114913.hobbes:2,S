It is also referred to as thermal inertia. It takes time for the heat sink to
1. heat up
2. start transferring that head out
During that time delay the chip may easily overheat in a burst of activity.
Same thing happens to fuses... a "slow blow" fuse will blow faster in higher
ambient temperature, under conditions that are normal because the AC was
turned on...
