Well, if you notice, I've been moving most of such workarounds to
prom_init.c, that is, to the code that actually fetches the device-tree
from the firmware, which make things easier.
There are still a few, notably in prom_parse.c, but I'm pretty confident
they aren't too invasive (and I need to backport more fixes from david
there) and in macio_asic, but the later is specific enough to not be a
problem.

Yes, that's one big thing we'll need to do.

Hooks ? How so ?
It's easier to start merging powerpc and sparc I reckon and then, "fix"
that so that it works on x86 :-)

You know very well what I meant :-) The ones where it makes sense to
write them back to OF. On machines where OF dies, there are mecanism via
the nvram to store properties in /options (like boot-device etc...),
there are at least 2 such mecanisms (apple oldworld and chrp), and on
machines where OF is still alive, that should probably be an OF call of
some sort.
So we do want some sort of platform hook for -these-, but at the same
time, that's fairly low on the list. Currently, we have no code in the
kernel to deal with that on powerpc, it's all userland via /dev/nvram,
and I reckon it might just stay that way with platform specific userland
tools for a little longer.
Ben.
