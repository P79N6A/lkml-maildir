The patch I just sent changes this ... if we can find PCI headers,
we should return nothing.

It looks like nothing that makes any sense to me.  Maybe it's a blanked
EEPROM or something.  This particular device is on the motherboard of a
prototype machine, so there could be almost anything going on with it ;-)

No, that's normal behaviour on ia64 -- unacknowledged PCI reads cause a
machine check rather than reading ffffffff like x86 does.
