Well, the real bugs that cause the problem are described by me above.
I don't have a fix for those, but the workaround is in 2.6.23
under git 4047727e5ae33f9b8d2b7766d1994ea6e5ec2991 Fix SMP poweroff hangs.
With that workaround, there's no more hanging on halt,
though there could still be a hang on reboot.
A problem with that workaround is that it has no effect unless
the CPU hotplug code is configured (CONFIG_PM_SLEEP_SMP and pals).
Cheers
