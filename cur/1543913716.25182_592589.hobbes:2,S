Yes, but there's some risk that such a change will cause a
presently-working system to stop working.  It's quite likely, if that
system is checking the procfs-creation return value.
So I think it'd be best if we were to detect the duplication and print a
warning (which should include, if possible, the full pathname and a
dump_stack()) and then the code should proceed as normal: permit the
duplicated entry and return success.
Then, when such duplicates are reported, we can work out what to do about
them on a case-by-case basis.
(btw, please feed your patches through scripts/checkpatch.pl - that one had
a remarkably high coding-style-error-density).
