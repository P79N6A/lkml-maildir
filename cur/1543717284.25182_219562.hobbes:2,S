Hi Vojtech,
I have some more input patches. Nothing too intresting, most of the important
stuff has been posted on LKML before. Here they are:
01-serio-whitespace.patch:
	trailing whitespace fixes in drivers/input/serio
02-kbd98io-interrupt.patch:
	kbd98io_interrupt should return irqreturn_t
03-kdb98-interrupt.patch:
	kbd98_interrupt should return irqreturn_t
04-h3600-fixes.patch:
	various fixes for H3600 touchscreen driver
         - h3600ts_interrupt, npower_button_handler and action_button_handler
           should return irqreturn_t
         - fix missing argument in h3600ts_process_packet call
         - add MODULE_AUTHOR, MODULE_DESCRIPTION and MODULE_LICENSE
         - small formatting changes
	It still does not compile because of bad PM_ constants though
05-twidjoy-fixes.patch:
         - twidjoy_interrupt should return irqreturn_t
         - add MODULE_DESCRIPTION and MODULE_LICENSE
06-keyboard-whitespace.patch:
	trailing whitespace fixes in drivers/input/keyboard
07-power-license.patch:
	power - add MODULE_LICENSE
08-joystick-whitespace.patch:
	trailing whitespace fixes in drivers/input/joystick
09-gameport-whitespace.patch:
	trailing whitespace fixes in drivers/input/gameport
10-input-whitespace.patch:
	trailing whitespace fixes in drivers/input
11-synaptics-reconnect.patch:
	do not call synaptics_init unless we are ready to do full
        mouse setup or we can oops on resume
12-i8042-interrupt.patch:
	split i8042 interrupt handling into an IRQ handler and a tasklet,
	as with mousedev, evdev and so on we were doing too much work in
	IRQ context
13-i8042-unload.patch:
	Patch from Sau Dan Lee
  	Kill the timer only after removing interrupt handler,
        otherwise there is a chance that interrupt handler will install
        the timer again and it will trigger after module is unloaded.
14-mousedev-multiplexing.patch:
	better multiplex absolute and relative devices; cleanups
I did merge with Linus' tree to resolve conflicts with Eric's latest
changes to logips2pp (hope he does not mind). Please do:
bk pull bk://dtor.bkbits.net/input
The following patches are against your tree rather then Linis' and I will
not post whitespace fixing patches as they are too boring...
There is also a cumulative patch agains Linus' tree at:
