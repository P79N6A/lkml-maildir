Yes. That is another solution. But there is some problem about
early_ioremap (boot_ioremap, bt_ioremap for i386) or ioremap.
- ioremap can not be used before mem_init.
- For i386, boot_ioremap can map at most 4 pages, bt_ioremap can map
at most 16 pages. This will be an unnecessary constrains for size of
setup_data.
- For i386, the virtual memory space of ioremap is limited too.
