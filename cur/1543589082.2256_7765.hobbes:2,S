You misunderstood the context of what I said, I perfectly know the race
you are talking about, I was answering Linus's question "the
wait_on_buffer isn't even necessary to protect ext2 against ext2". You
are talking about the other race that is "ext2" against "block_dev", and
I obviously agree on that one since the first place as I immediatly
answered you "correct".
What I'm saying above is that even without the wait_on_buffer ext2 can
screwup itself because the splice happens after the buffer are just all
uptodate so any "reader" (I mean any reader through ext2 not through
block_dev) will never try to do a bread on that blocks before they're
just zeroed and uptodate.
