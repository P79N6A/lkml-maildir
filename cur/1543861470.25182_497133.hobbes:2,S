This has been bugging me for a while.
Viewing the mail I applied in mutt shows his name correctly as Rafał
Applying it with git-applymbox and viewing the log on master.kernel.org
with git log shows Rafa<B3>   And then later when put into email
it turns into Rafa³

If there's something I should be doing when I commit that I'm not,
I'll be happy to change my scripts.  My $LANG is set to en_US.UTF-8
which should DTRT to the best of my knowledge, but clearly, that isn't
the case.
