a) devmapper is merged, but it sure as hell is not mandatory
b) relying on the hotplug working right means living dangerously.  Right
now that code is brittle in the best case.
c) all existing races in overlapping attach/detach (and $DEITY witness,
there's a plenty) immediately become much wider [OK, that's part of
(b), actully]
IOW, right now the thing is nowhere near being ready for such use.
