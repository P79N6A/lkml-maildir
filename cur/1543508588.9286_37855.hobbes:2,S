I noticed that if a pipe is opened with O_NONBLOCK, then pipe_read()
calls down_trylock(), and pipe_write() calls down_interruptible().
Why does pipe_read() call down_trylock() instead of
down_interruptible()?
If the pipe buffer is full, and 2 thread try to read 10 bytes, then the
current code would return -EAGAIN for one of the calls. I'm not sure,
but this seems wrong.
Obviously, pipe_read() with O_NONBLOCK must not wait for new data from
user space, but since POSIX allows preemptive multitasking, the kernel
can schedule() around without violating the standard.
