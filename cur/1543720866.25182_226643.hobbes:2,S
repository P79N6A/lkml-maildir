Why does the world need yet another kernel patchset? There are a couple of 
reasons, basically. The first is that I have a bunch of free time coming up, 
and I want to get back in sync with the kernel hacking process. The other is 
that I want to strike a balance: a little more experimental than -ck, but 
with less heavy updating and (I hope) potential instability than -mm.
I intend to release mostly for release kernels only; this one is for 2.6.7-rc3 
because I'm impatient and because that is what Con is currently syncing up 
with.
All that being said, at 
http://hobbs.dynup.net/patches/2.6.7-rc3-ar1/
 you can 
find the initial version of the patch, with staircase, 
autoregulate-swappiness, supermount-ng, ext3 and reiser improvements, and a 
free toy in every box. Passes the boot test on i386; if it breaks anywhere 
that rc3 doesn't, I'd love to hear about it. If it makes your machine twice 
as fast, I'd love to hear about that too.

P.S. I read via GMANE, so Cc:ing me if you want my attention couldn't hurt.
