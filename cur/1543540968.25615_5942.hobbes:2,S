Subject: [Dumb Patch] socket.c

During nmap scans with test5-pre<something> I keep getting warnings like
sendto in send_ip_raw: sendto(4, packet, 28, 0, 172.16.4.0, 16) => No
buffer space available
I'm about to try with test6-pre6 if it'll run without e2fs problems.

Completely unrelated patch; if it looks weird, look up about 10 lines.
