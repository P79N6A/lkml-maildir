Subject: [PATCH] add raw driver Kconfig entry for s390
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/13/41

From: Ihno Krumreich <ihno@suse.de>
The raw module is not enabled on s390/s390x
During SLES9 and SLES10 development IBM filed bugs about the missing raw
driver. Avoid that for SLES11 by adding it to the other char driver
entries.
