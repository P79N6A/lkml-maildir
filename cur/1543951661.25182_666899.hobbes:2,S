Certainly, but let's do it under separate cover, and after some of
these cleanups settle.  (I'd rather not try to get into it this week.)

Your log entry was explicit about the semantics change there.  You
explained it up front and justified it.  I also happened to agree
with it, but that's a separate issue.
I am certainly not opposed to semantics changes a priori.
I happen to have reservations about this particular one.

The point is that, whenever possible, a semantics change should be
isolated into a patch separate from any related cleanups.  More
important than that, no semantics change should go unmentioned so
it's only documented as a result of someone's careful review of
the change.  (Of course when a change is inadvertent, then only
review is going to notice it--that's what review is for.)
Your new pair of patches dated 2008-3-12 look like they are doing
exactly this (just the cleanup first).  After those are in, the
semantics change you want is a one-liner and easy to review and
discuss on its own.

I had noticed that your wholes sometimes go up to 1.5; I just
figured it's because you're 50% more thorough than the rest of us.
