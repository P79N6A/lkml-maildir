hi,
as the subject might presume, the parport_pc modules oopses when it's 
unloaded. so on every shutdown i see an Oops on the console, which get 
logged to syslog then:

yes, the kernel is tainted with the nvidia module, i try to reprodduce 
later on without nvidia.
upon manual "rmmod parport_pc", this exits with a seg-fault, the log shows:
http://christian.go4more.de/parport/parport_pc-rmmod.txt
This is with vanilla 2.6.0-test3, i386, Debian unstable (glibc
2.3.2-2, kernel compiled with gcc (GCC) 3.3.2 20030812 (Debian prerelease).
more info available, of course.
Thanks,
Christian.
PS: i have 2.6.0-test3 (and previous versions) running now for 
days/weeks und X11, normal use, sometimes under load, some quirks, but 
*no* crashes! Thank you!
