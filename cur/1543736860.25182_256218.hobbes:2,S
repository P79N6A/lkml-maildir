I have been battling with myself about whether to keep them consistent
with probe/init or make them as they are today... My issue with
*detect returning -1 on failure is that the caller's code will look
like:
        if (max_proto >= PSMOUSE_IMPS && !intellimouse_detect(psmouse, set_properties))
                return PSMOUSE_IMPS;
or 
        if (max_proto >= PSMOUSE_IMPS && intellimouse_detect(psmouse, set_properties) == 0)
                return PSMOUSE_IMPS;
which does not flow for me when I read the code. With pretty much every
other function caller checks for negative and exits in case of error, it
reads naturally as well. Here with multiple btanches I go "... and
intellimouse is NOT detected... oh, wait, it IS detected..."
Oh, well. I guess I will convert them... unless I managed to presuade you
to keep them as is ;).
