Subject: [PATCH] [ACPI] acpi_shutdown: Only prepare for power off on power_off
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/27/8

When acpi_sleep_prepare was moved into a shutdown method we
started calling it for all shutdowns.  It appears this triggers
some systems to power off on reboot.  Avoid this by only calling
acpi_sleep_prepare if we are going to power off the system.
