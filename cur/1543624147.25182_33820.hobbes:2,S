   Can we also ask you to decode your oopses
   (as described in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
   This is absolute requirement if you want unknown bugs you are hitting to
   be resolved.
   Luckily this bug was already known, so we was able to provide a patch
   without the decoded oops, but this is not always the case.
Bye,
    Oleg
