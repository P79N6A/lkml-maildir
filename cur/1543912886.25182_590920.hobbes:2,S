"tend to be" does not lend itself to being cleanly tested ... and i
imagine i'd get some pretty heavy resistance if i proposed
re-organzing code just so that i could compile it outside of the
kernel
there is still the ABI issue ... code written in kernel space in pure
asm cannot always be compiled in userspace and work properly/the same

you mean testing boundary overflows ?  can be handled with canaries
rather than segfaults i imagine ...
