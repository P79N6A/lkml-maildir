Subject: [BUG] 2.6.23-rc3 can't see sd partitions on Alpha

Completely reproducible... 2.6.23-rc3 kernel boots, and normal messages
are seen on console as far as disks found and partitions on each.  However,
once /dev is populated and the boottime scripts attempt to check filesystem
status, no partitions on either of the two disks attached to the SCSI
controller are seen.  Dropping into a single-user root shell confirms
the sudden "blindness": fdisk can't open /dev/sda.
When I reboot on 2.6.24-rc2, everything works normally.
System environment is Debian Etch.  Both 2.6.24-rc2 and -rc3 were built
from the respective unaltered kernel.org source trees, using the same
kernel configuration modulo saying "no" to CONFIG_SENSORS_I5K_AMB and
CONFIG_PID_NS in -rc3.  No problems with -rc3 on a x86 box.
