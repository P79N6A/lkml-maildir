Why does it have to remain valid?  As long as the kernel doesn't crash
on any of the operations associated with the futex syscalls let the
address space region explode, implode, whatever.  It's  a bug in the
program if the address region is changed while a futex is placed
there.  If the futex syscall hangs forever or returns with a bogus
state (error or even success) this is perfectly acceptable.  We
shouldn't slow down correct uses just to make it possible for broken
programs to receive a more detailed error description.
