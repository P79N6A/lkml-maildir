The location of db_185.h is somewhat vendor dependent. In my case
(Mandrake cooker), the location is in /usr/include/db3 rather than
/usr/include/db. You have a couple of choices for now... symlink db3 to
db if that is your situation or back out that portion of the patch to
use the original db1 library. I personally chose the symlink, but it
does highlight the problem of having userspace dependencies in the
tree...
