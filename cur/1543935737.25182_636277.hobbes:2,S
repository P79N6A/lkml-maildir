I think multi user systems are not all that interesting.  And I
suspect very few of them want reliably working suspend/hibernate
(which they wouldn't get due to other issues anyway), or have weird
shutdown scripts which stop when they are unable to umount
filesystems.
For paranoid sysadmins, I suggest not enabling fuse for unprivileged
users, which is pretty easy to do: just don't set /dev/fuse to be
world read-writable (which is the default BTW).
So your reasons just don't warrant a big effort involving VFS hacking,
etc.  Patches are of course welcome.
