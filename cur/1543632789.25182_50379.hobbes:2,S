Lately I spent a couple of hours through the info I've at hand 
concerning the 645DX ATA/133 support.
My problem lies in the original 645 (only ATA/100 capable) versus the 645DX.
I should have no problem coding support for each one. In fact the 
original 645 should already be supported (I says "should" as I've no 
success reports, people tends to write reports when there is a failure 
:-). The problem is I don't yet know how to differentiate them. So I 
can't support both of them in the same driver and this is a show stopper 
for me.
If anyone on the list knows how to make the difference, please mail me 
the info.
A complete lspci -vxxx from both a 645 and a 645DX might help if the 
difference lies in the config registers but I'm unsure.
LB.
