That's just extra markup for me to filter out.  Either the first line nonblank 
has a special meaning or it doesn't.  Currently, it doesn't.

You're too optimistic, but if it's something we can check automatically we can 
find and fix instances that don't.  (Although in this case "automatic" means 
we generate the index, put it on the web, and either we notice mistakes or 
people point them out to us.)

You are aware that some of the files in Documentation aren't text, right?  
There's example code in C, there's docbook, there's a gif and an xpm...
What variant of "fast" do you mean?  Processing the entire directory takes a 
fraction of a second on my laptop.
I'm not really invested in 00-INDEX, but I point out that it currently exists 
and I've indicated a willingness to do work to update it.  If you want to do 
your own work to update something else, be my guest.  I'll be over here.

You're adding complexity again.  Why are you adding complexity?

00-INDEX is a bad place for it, and MAINTAINERS hasn't go the granularity.

I was wondering if this would be noticed...
