Hello.
My server have lost about ~300MB of RAM. Details:
webcache:~# uname -a
Linux webcache 2.4.33-pre1 #2 Wed Feb 8 18:26:44 CET 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
No other patches. Only basic elements needed to work in network
enviroment.
webcache:~# dmesg | grep MEM
127MB HIGHMEM available.
896MB LOWMEM available.
When I count memmory used by processes (column SIZE from ps or RES from
top) there is about 650MB used. (There is only squid, named and basic
system deamons running on that host). But:
webcache:~# free -m
            total       used       free     shared  buffers    cached
Mem:         1009        996         13          0       18        32
-/+ buffers/cache:       945         64
Swap:        1953          0       1952
So there is missing about ~300MB.
If anyone wants to have more detailed info feel free to ask.
