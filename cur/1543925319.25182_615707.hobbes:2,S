Hello,
Sorry for posting here, it seems the best spot; if I need to redirect
this to mtd-utils team, please tell me.
I'm playing around with some jffs2 files. While trying to mount (via
block2mtd, loop) a jffs2 system, a "kernel BUG message" appeared in
dmesg, with these lines:
kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:2204!
invalid opcode: 0000 [#1]
SMP
Call trace is
Call Trace:
 [<c0477358>] __kmalloc+0xd/0x64
 [<f950d626>] jffs2_scan_medium+0x2a5/0x131a [jffs2]
 [<c046137d>] __alloc_pages+0x68/0x2a0
 [<f9516f4b>] jffs2_sum_init+0x50/0x9d [jffs2]
If someone is interested in digging deeper in this, please contact me
directly by email (I'm not subscribed to the list) for more
information
Cheers,
Alex
