Wait a minute, if it fails the system drops back to software, which is 
not as good in a pedantic analysis, but perhaps falls a good bit short 
of "catastrophic consequences" as most people would characterize that 
phrase. And more to the point, now that many CPUs and chipsets are the 
RNG of choice, what is the actual probability of a failure of the RNG 
leaving a functional system (that's a real question seeking response 
from someone who has some actual data).
It would be desirable for the kernel to detect a failure and do 
something appropriate, but I have to feel that if an RNG is in the CPU 
or chipset, it would serve users better to use it. By default. People 
who need quality entropy would be better served by a hardware source, 
and people who don't (or fail to realize they do) would not be hurt by 
use of better numbers.
I'm not sure you would get people to agree what should be done if a 
hardware RNG fails, other than make the failure information available to 
user space.
