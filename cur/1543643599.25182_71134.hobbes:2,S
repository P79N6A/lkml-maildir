It's the following
		task_t *trace_task = p->parent;
		int ptrace_flag = p->ptrace;
		BUG_ON (ptrace_flag == 0);
		__ptrace_unlink(p);
		p->ptrace = ptrace_flag;
		__ptrace_link(p, trace_task);

You aren't looking the source.
void reparent_to_init(void)
{
	write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
	ptrace_unlink(current);
	/* Reparent to init */
	REMOVE_LINKS(current);
	current->parent = child_reaper;
	current->real_parent = child_reaper;
	SET_LINKS(current);
	/* Set the exit signal to SIGCHLD so we signal init on exit */
	current->exit_signal = SIGCHLD;
	current->ptrace = 0;

??? You forget tasklist_lock?
