indeed. Yesterday at 13:00 I have switched from 2.6.19.1 to 2.6.19.2
(without the ipsec fix) and at about 17:30 linux has crashed again.
I have recompiled 2.6.19.2 with all kernel debugging options enabled
and rebooted. Now I'm waiting for the crash...

Ok, monday morning I will try to do a git bisect. I just want tell you
that this machine is a firewall (3 nic) + ipsec gateway (openswan) +
http proxy (squid). I think that the problem is related to the networking.
I have other 2.6.19/2.6.20 linux boxes acting as proftpd/samba/sendmail
without any problem.

Ok I will run xfs_repair and post results.

ok , thanks a lot for the feedback.
PS: I'm running slackware 11 with xfsprogs-2.8.10. Are they fine
or should I upgrade?
