i've tried both direct mapped and sg, but it still get pci_map_sg() failures
in sym53c8xx. the sg version, below, won't boot (scsi commands all timeout).
while the added direct map version does boot, it suffers the same problem as
the stock code.
third direct map:
	hose->sg_pci = NULL;
	hose->sg_isa = iommu_arena_new(hose, 0x00800000, 0x00800000, 32768);
	__direct_map_base = 0x40000000;
	__direct_map_size = 0x88000000;
	*(vip)CIA_IOC_PCI_W3_BASE = 0xc0000000 | 1;
	*(vip)CIA_IOC_PCI_W3_MASK = (0x08000000 - 1) & 0xfff00000;
	*(vip)CIA_IOC_PCI_T3_BASE = 0x80000000 >> 2;
sg (doesn't work):
	hose->sg_isa = iommu_arena_new(hose, 0x00800000, 0x00800000, 32768);
	hose->sg_pci = iommu_arena_new(hose, 0xc0000000, 0x08000000, 32768);
	__direct_map_base = 0x40000000;
	__direct_map_size = 0x80000000;
	*(vip)CIA_IOC_PCI_W3_BASE = hose->sg_pci->dma_base | 3;
	*(vip)CIA_IOC_PCI_W3_MASK = (hose->sg_pci->size - 1) & 0xfff00000;
	*(vip)CIA_IOC_PCI_T3_BASE = virt_to_phys(hose->sg_pci->ptes) >> 2;
