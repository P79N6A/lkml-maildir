I think you are misinterpreting the man page, because it isn't worded 
very clearly.  It should not even mention O_CREAT because it has nothing 
to do with O_EXCL; it is just repeating the semantics of O_CREAT ( if 
the file already exists, the call fails ) which would of course, apply 
if you do use O_CREAT in conjunction with any other flag including 
O_EXCL.  It does not say that you must use O_EXCL with O_CREAT.  The 
rest of the description talks about using lockfiles as an alternative to 
ensure exclusive access to the file on NFS where O_EXCL is broken.  The 
intent of O_EXCL is clearly to provide the caller with exclusive access 
to the file.
