They most definitely do have an MMU.  The vector models usually (always?)
used process-swapping rather than demand-paging:  no page faults (because
exceptions weren't precise).  I don't know if the non-vector models allowed
paging or not.

AS/400 has been using PowerPC derivatives (PowerAS :-) processors for
a fairly long time now.  Is it really MMUless ?  I know they use a single
address space, but an MMU can still be useful for many other things.
