I presume you refer to:
  page-cluster
  ------------
  page-cluster controls the number of pages which are written to swap in
  a single attempt.  The swap I/O size.
  It is a logarithmic value - setting it to zero means "1 page", setting
  it to 1 means "2 pages", setting it to 2 means "4 pages", etc.
  The default value is three (eight pages at a time).  There may be some
  small benefits in tuning this to a different value if your workload is
  swap-intensive.
I didn't know that controlled whether the pages were contiguous (or written to 
contiguous locations in swap).  I thought it was just how many the VM tried 
to free at a time.
Still, worth a tweak.  Thanks.
