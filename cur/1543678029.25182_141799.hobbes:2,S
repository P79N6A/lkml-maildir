No, you don't, IFF you distribute the source code.  Doesn't make
a lot of sense though.  So consider, a for-profit company licenses
QT for a proprietary app.  They send bug fixes/enhancements to QT
to TrollTech.  If these migrate to Free QT, you're ahead of the game.
If they don't, what did you lose?

No, they don't.  KDE uses the GPL for QT.  If I build a commercial
app using KDE, it is GPL.  If I build a commercial app not using
KDE, but using commercial QT, that has no effect on the KDE desktop.

They can't.  They released the code under GPL.  They can stop maintaining
that code, and continue on a proprietary track.  If they did, what
did you lose?
In summary, QT -> GPL, GNOME - GPL, what about _that_ makes one or
the other inherently preferable or better?
P.S. for once I am in complete agreement with larry m. ;-)
