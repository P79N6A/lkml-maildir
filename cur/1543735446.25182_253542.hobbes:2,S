Subject: [PATCH 2.4] scripts: Support output of new ld
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
This is one in a handful of small patches that I'll be sending along in
the near future. This patch allows scripts/ver_linux to find out the ld
version for versions of ld that have different output on 'ld -v' (new
ones have "GNU" at the beginning.)
Marcelo, please apply.
