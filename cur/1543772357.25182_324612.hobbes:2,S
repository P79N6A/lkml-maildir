OK, this covers the drivers I know.  I didn't make any attempt to check
them all.
According to Robert Love's book there's at least one device than can
only DMA into a 24 bit address space, maybe the PCI NE2K?
Sommary: Add mask defines for some devices that can't DMA into full
32/64 bit address space.
