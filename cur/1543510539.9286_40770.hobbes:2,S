I'm seeing this w/ 2.3.18ac8, Netscape 4.6 (RH rpm), remote POP3
retrieve, AMD K6-2 350.
This occurs in several recently-received messages:  the message header
is interrupted in the middle by approximately 1024 ^@ control
characters.  It appears to overwrite the message header and beginning of
the body, as the mailbox folder size does not change pre- and
post-corruption.
Going back to my devel tree, based on Linus' 2.3.18, and the problem
goes away.  It is apparently only repeatable by using e-mail 'til it
breaks again.
