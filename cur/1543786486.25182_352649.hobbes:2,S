Yes, all of this works for me.
There is another problem on Alpha with 2.6.14-rc kernels, much worse:
slab.c:index_of() works _only_ when it's really inlined, because of
__builtin_constant_p() check. It happens to work on other archs
due to "always_inline" alchemy in compiler.h, but on Alpha we undo 
the "inline" redefinitions as they heavily break our internal stuff.
So the slab.c blows up very early on boot (at least when compiled
with gcc3).
I'd be happy if it is possible to stop global redefining of "inline"
keywords and just use __attribute__((always_inline)) when needed.
If not, I don't know how to fix that cleanly.
Richard?
Ivan.
