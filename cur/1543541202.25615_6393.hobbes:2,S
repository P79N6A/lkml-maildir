specweb99 includes dynamic content.  TUX is an in-kernel web server (and
far much more according to ingo, but i'd like to see the code first).

that's why I only compared linux results with linux results and nt
results with nt results.  i'd be interested to know if you think that
my assertion that `linux scales to 8 cpus better than nt scales to 4
cpus' is incorrect, based on the numbers below.  ignore the raw numbers.
the per-cpu degradation is what i'm interested in comparing.

i think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the use of the word `scales'.
you're using it to mean `performs'.
