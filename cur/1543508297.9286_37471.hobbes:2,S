First, this is a userspace problem because normally only
init levels 0-6 and S are defined.  Read the manual and
/etc/inittab for more details.

It's not a kernel crash, read below.

SVGAlib programs have control over the hardware. Full control
over the hardware, passing by the kernel.
This means that if you (being root) are stupid enough to kill
those programs and then switch to a console the kernel doesn't
have control over (because it gave control to the svgalib
program), then you're stuck on a non-working terminal.
In short, make sure that svgalib programs clean themselves up
properly or use the framebuffer driver instead of the svgalib
one...
