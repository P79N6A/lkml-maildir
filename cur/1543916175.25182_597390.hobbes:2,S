But this is concerning a page being freed before the TLB flush has been 
performed. Another process may then reuse the page and may rely on the 
fact that there is no TLB entry installed for the page that was just 
allocated. But there is still one there. The issues that result from this 
may be depend on the nature of each MMU.
Granted we usually install another TLB entry for the page mapping the page 
into a different address space and never use the old TLB. Which is likely 
the reason why we have never seen an issue before and also why this is 
probably difficult to cause any issues in the first place.
Plus this can only occur for off node pages, meaning this must involve a 
remote processor and the other processor is likely to have a completely 
different set of TLB entries.
