It must be time for me to see if I can find enough 9 to 25 pin 
adaptors and stick an led sniffer in the line then, because I cannot 
talk to the trs80 Color Computer on the other end of the cable.
I'll be back on this if I find anything interesting.  Of more interest 
is the fact that the belkin bulldog kits upsd cannot talk to 
/dev/ttyS1 although it is picking up data from the port.  It outputs 
on localhost:2710 but its only the keep-alive chatter from the ups.  
Apparently no commands can be sent to the ups.
This however, is a seriel port problem, not usb.  I was sort of hoping 
there might be a common thread to the failures. :)
