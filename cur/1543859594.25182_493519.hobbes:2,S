Yeah, it's abuse.
Problem is in wait_for_all_aios(), it is checking wait status without
properly holding an ioctx lock. Perhaps, this patch is walking on thin
ice.  It abuses rcu over a buggy code. OTOH, I really don't want to hold
ctx_lock over the entire wakeup call at the end of aio_complete:
        if (waitqueue_active(&ctx->wait))
                wake_up(&ctx->wait);
I'm worried about longer lock hold time in aio_complete and potentially 
increase lock contention for concurrent I/O completion.  A quick look
at lockmeter data I had on a 4 socket system (with dual core + HT), it
already showing signs of substantial lock contention in aio_complete.
I'm afraid putting the above call inside ioctx_lock will make things
worse.
And synchronize_rcu fits the bill perfectly: aio_complete sets wakeup
status, drop ioctx_lock, do the wakeup call all protected inside rcu
lock.  Then wait_for_all_aios will just wait for all that sequence to
complete before it proceed with __put_ioctx().  All nice and easy.
