Subject: how to determine if the noexec stack is defined by an application

I'm reading Ingo's NX quick start document:
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/nx-patches/QuickStart-NX.txt
Quote:
"If an application defines a noexec stack then the kernel will enforce 
this executability, and all attempts to execute on the stack will be 
prevented by the hardware."
My question is related to the conditional "if an application". So it 
looks like it depends on the app.
Now, the OS/hardware combination that I'm using (RHEL4 WS 32 bit on 
AMD64 CPU - long story, don't ask) definitely enables NX:
# grep -i nx /var/log/dmesg
NX (Execute Disable) protection: active
But it's running a Web service which is a combination of C code and 
Tomcat/Java. I have no clue how to determine which portions specify a 
noexec stack and which don't.
In case it turns out some portions do not specify a noexec stack, my 
next question is how to get the application to create a noexec stack 
(assume I can make that request to the developers).
