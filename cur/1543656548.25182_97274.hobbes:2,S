There are 2 issues with this implementation that will likely not effect you.
First, when dumping core of MT applications with LOTS of threads the pthread 
library signals all the threads in the  application to exit.  Sometimes 
the process that is dumping core fails to suspend other threads in the 
application before some exit.  The result of this is that for such 
applications you will not see them in the core file.  
You have to work at it to see this failure.  The way I reproduce this is to 
run a test application with about 555 pthread threads in it and send it a 
sig_quit.  When I look at the core file wont have all 555 threads.  SMP makes 
this effect a bit more noticeable.
Ingo's design to fix this change the exit path for thread to wait for the 
core file to get dumped before finishing the process clean up.  I like this 
approach, I just wish I thought of it ;)
Second, the controversial issue is in the way my design pauses the other 
threads in the MT application.  Its not semaphore lock safe.  Although no 
instance of the following failure has been seen, it is possible with new 
kernel code.
If one of the processes in the MT application is currently holding semaphore 
lock when the dumping process pauses it, AND the dumping process does any 
blocking operation that could attempt to grab this same semaphore, THEN the 
core dump will deadlock.  Boom.
My patch is good for developers, pending the back port of Ingo's version.
Do let me know how it works out for you.
