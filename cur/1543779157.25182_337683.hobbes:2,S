Okay, I took 2.6.13-rc3-mm3, removed TIF_FREEZE patch, and applied
your series. (This time it applied cleanly). After first suspend
machine locked hard at time it should switch back to original
console. On the next try, it appeared to lock up, but then I somehow
managed to switch consoles... unfortunately it was locked up hard at
that point, too.
