Rather than using __nongpreldata, I should be able to say that it's in
.rodata - which seems to be more correct anyway - and throw into a comment to
say why.
I can't quite work out, though, how the kernel build stuff gets the datum into
the kernel build.  I can see there's a script, but I never see the output of
the script crop up anywhere in the build tree:-/  GDB reports, though, that
kallsyms_num_syms gets the right value.
