Umm, this replaces alloc_chrdev_region too. If instead you mean "let's
migrate all the users to a sensible interface", I agree. And that
means killing alloc_chrdev_region too. (baseminor makes no sense for
dynamic allocation - you either know your prefered major and minor or
you know neither.)

I think killing /proc/devices has to wait until after devfs removal,
when everyone is more or less comfortable with its alternatives.
