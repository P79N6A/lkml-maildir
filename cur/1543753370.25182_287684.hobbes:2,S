Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Conversion to compat_ioctl for ALSA drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
the following three patches convert the 32bit ioctl layer of ALSA to
the new compat_ioctl (and unlocked_ioctl for native ioctls).
The first patch covers the basic entries and control API.
The second patch is for PCM API.
The last one is for other APIs including OSS-emulation modules.
After these patches are applied, remove the whole subtree in
sound/core/ioctl32.  The files in this directory are no longer
necessary.
