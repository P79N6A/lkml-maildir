Which framebuffer driver and backlight driver are you using?
("ls /sys/class/backlight/" will show which backlight it is)
Is the machine in active use when it dims or at idle and does the screen
blank at the same time it dims? If so, does the keypress unblank the
screen (but not change the brightness)? 
Also, is this on a console or under something like X? 
Thanks,
Richard
