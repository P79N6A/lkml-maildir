At least most (in not all) of the code paths are not inside the lock.
For example pci_enable_msi() is called from a device driver, and it
directly does
	dev->bus->ops->read(dev->bus, dev->devfn, msi_control_reg(pos),
		2, &control);
as well as calling lots of other functions that do similar stuff.
In fact I don't see how any of the stuff in msi.c could be protected
by pci_lock, since pci_lock is static to access.c and only used inside
the pci_bus_read_config_xxx and pci_bus_write_config_xxx functions
defined there.
