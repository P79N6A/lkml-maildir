The 5th and 6th patch in this series do that by allowing you to write
!Pfilename section title
in a docbook template file to insert the contents of such a section.
It's what I'm doing for mac80211's docs so that browsing the files gives
you the same documentation as reading the mac80211 docbook book just
organised differently.
