That doesn't help for MAP_ANON pages.
That doesn't help when there are multiple useful cache settings.
It's not sane for every arch-independent driver to implement an
ioctl() or alternate devices. For PPC, you'd need 12 devices.
To a limited extent, the PPC can handle conflicting settings in
a useful manner. Not all 12 settings at once, but more than one.
BTW, reverse mappings could be useful for conflicting settings.
It is perfectly reasonable for a user to want non-coherent
memory and memory with odd caching behavior. It is not entirely
unreasonable to want large regions of memory to be BAT-mapped
for somewhat dedicated (Beowulf compute cluster) systems.
