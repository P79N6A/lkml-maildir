It is?  How about:
linux/include/public/foo.h
contains all constants and similar which should be exported to userspace.
linux/include/linux/foo.h
does #include <public/foo.h> and then contains kernel-specific stuff.
We would also require public-asm being a link to public-asmXXX for each
architecture XXX.
Then return to the symlink solution where /usr/include/linux is a symlink
to /usr/src/linux/include/public and /usr/include/asm is a symlink to
/usr/src/linux/include/public-asm.
Surely this cures all the problems?  This split would enable glibc
to keep copies of the kernel headers more easily too, if the symlink
solution is not acceptable.
