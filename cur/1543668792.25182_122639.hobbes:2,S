that's certainly the most interesting ;). Actually in this case it seems
a quite common workload too which makes it even more interesting. I'm
quite surprised you see a big regression.

for the pure shm you can see /dev/shm and `ipcs`. For the regular
MAP_SHARED you'd need to have a look at /proc/pid/maps of mysql.

this looks good. You're around 200M in swap, and you probably want to
avoid that. The suggestions of vm_mapped_ratio and lower_zone_reserve=
still looks the most appropriate here ;)

you need to reboot to pass profile=2 to generate /proc/profile yes

It's minimal but there definitely was some swapin, and swapin are
often synchronous, so I don't exclude completely the slowdown is due
more swapping.
Would be interesting to see a /proc/meminfo with 2.4.17 and vmstat too
to see if it's swapping much less, or similar.

Ok.
One more thing, if the db is doing lots of sync writes that makes the
async cache not very worthwhile, you could also try:
	echo 30 500 0 0 500 3000 40 20 0 >/proc/sys/vm/bdflush
to decrease the amount of dirty memory that can coexist at any given
time. I recall 2.4.17 was more restrictive on that.
But the most interesting will be the readprofile.
