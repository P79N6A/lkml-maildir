No.
You'd be right if you ran iPAQ's rom on zaurus. But sharp's rom uses
diferent protocol, so this is still needed. Reflashing zaurus is
possibility, but not everyone does that, (cf card needed), and if you
reflash to change protocol (noone does that) your zaurus will be
incompatible with every other zaurus.
