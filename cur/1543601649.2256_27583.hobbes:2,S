One more question: if I guess wrong initially about how many
file descriptors I'll be monitoring with /dev/epoll, and I need
to increase the size of the area inside /dev/epoll in the middle of
my scan through the results, what is the proper sequence of calls?
Some possibilities:
1)  EP_ALLOC, and continue scanning through the results
2)  EP_FREE, EP_ALLOC, EP_POLL because old results are now invalid
3)  EP_FREE, EP_ALLOC, write new copies of all the old fds to /dev/epoll, 
    EP_POLL, and start new scan
I bet it's #3.  Am I right?
