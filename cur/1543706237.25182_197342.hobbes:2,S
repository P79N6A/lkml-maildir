It's quite possible that their existence block sanitizing the pty code, 
or more specifically, the pty support in the generic tty code.  I'll see 
what I can do about it; it's possible it'll just fall out nicely in the 
end, but I really have no desire to jump through hoops to preserve what 
is a fundamentally broken legancy interface.
