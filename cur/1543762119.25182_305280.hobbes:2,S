!!!  The difference is that in the stock kernel, rcu_check_callbacks()
is invoked from irq.  In PREEMPT_RT, it is invoked from process context
and appears to be preemptible.  This means that rcu_advance_callbacks()
can be preempted, resulting in all sorts of problems.  Need to disable
preemption over this.
There are probably other bugs of this sort, I will track them down.
But, just to make sure I understand -- if I have preempt disabled over
all accesses to a per-CPU variable, and that variable is -not- accessed
from a real interrupt handler, then I am safe without a lock, right?
						Thanx, Paul
PS.  Fixing my stupid bugs that you pointed out in earlier email,
     as well.  :-/
