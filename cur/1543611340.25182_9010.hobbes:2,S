 Hi.
  What is the trick to get more than 2^16 uids working on all services??
  I'm using kernel 2.4.14, libc6 compiled with 2.4.7 headers, lib(pam|nss)-ldap
  openldap, wu-imap, cuci-pop, samba, telnet, ssh, Debian Potato.
  'id' and 'getent passwd high-uid-user' both return the right uid (which 
is stored on the ldap system), but 'ls -l' truncates the uid if it's higher than
65536 (say for uid  80000, it reports  14464), and sshd, telnetd and imapd deny
logins because setuid() invalidates a >16 bit interger as argument.
   What should I recompile??  is there a moderately easy workaround??
  Thanks
   José
