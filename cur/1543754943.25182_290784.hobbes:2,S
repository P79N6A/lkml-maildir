Subject: Performance of iptables-restore on large rule sets

I have a large rule set (~53000 rules) that I sometimes load using 
iptables-restore.  (It takes almost an hour.
Googling around tells me that the loop detection code in the kernel is 
slow with large rule sets.  The only thing  that seems odd to me is that 
throughout the entire loading process, iptables-restore is consistently 
at about 67% user and33% system processor time according to vmstat.  If 
the slowness is in the kernel, shouldn't I be seeing a high and ever 
increasing amount of "system" time?
Kernel is 2.6.9-1.681_FC3.  Iptables is iptables-1.2.11-3.1.FC3.
Thanks for any insights,
Steve Bergman
