I spent less time emailing and more time coding. I have been working on

There have been improvements since the earlier iterations but it's still a 
fairness based design. Mike's "sticking point" test case should be improved 
as well.
My call based on my own testing and feedback from users is: 
Under niced loads it is 99% in favour of SD.
Under light loads it is 95% in favour of SD.
Under Heavy loads it becomes proportionately in favour of mainline. The 
crossover is somewhere around a load of 4.
If the reluctance to renice X goes away I'd say it was 99% across the board 
and to much higher loads.
