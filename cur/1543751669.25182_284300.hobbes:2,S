Andi has already dealt with some of the coding style issues elsewhere in 
the thread.
My comment:  This is playing with fire.  We've gone to considerable 
trouble to make the boot_cpu_id independent of the physical APIC ID 
(which is what hard_smp_processor_id() returns).  Different BIOSes and 
different CPU revisions can cause the boot processor to shift.
Examples:  We have a box where the boot CPU has an APIC ID of 3.  
Another system starts with the BSP == 3, but the BIOS renumbers it to 
zero after first reassigning the original 0 CPU.  So, the APIC IDs end 
up 0, 1, 2, 4.  Yet another system assigns the IDs:  0, 1, 6, 7.
We can expect even stranger numbering schemes in the future, given that 
dual core hyperthreaded CPUs are in the pipeline.  Creating any 
dependency between CPU number and APIC ID is a _bad_ idea.
