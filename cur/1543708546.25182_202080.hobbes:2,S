Linux dearly needs this. Please separate out this part
of the patch and send it in.
Right now, Linux does not report the recent CPU usage
of a process. The UNIX standard requires that "ps"
report this; right now ps substitutes CPU usage over
the whole lifetime of a process.
Both per-task and per-process (tid and tgid) numbers
are needed. Both percent and permill (1/1000) units
get reported, so don't convert to integer percent.
