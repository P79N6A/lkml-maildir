hi *
trying to mount an EFS (irix) CD -- I only can et it to mount using
mount -t efs /dev/sda /mnt -o loop
without loop, it fails always. if I now look at the cd it irregularly
crashes. no messages.
if I mount  harddrive with -o loop and efs, it also irregularly crashes.
if I do not use -o loop, it doesn't crash but after trying to tar a big
file (500 MB on the disk) :
Nov  6 19:18:24 grobbebol kernel: EFS: map_block() failed to map block 472423 (indir)
Nov  6 19:18:24 grobbebol kernel: EFS: map_block() failed to map block 472424 (indir)
Nov  6 19:18:24 grobbebol kernel: EFS: map_block() failed to map block 472425 (indir)
Nov  6 19:18:24 grobbebol kernel: EFS: map_block() failed to map block 472426 (indir)
Nov  6 19:18:24 grobbebol kernel: EFS: map_block() failed to map block 472427 (indir)
Nov  6 19:18:24 grobbebol kernel: EFS: map_block() failed to map block 472428 (indir)
etc. ad infinitum.
probably something wrong with the new code here ?
