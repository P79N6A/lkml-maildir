Well, yes, and I do all the time, but the dammed deprecation warning  
is just plain
stupid.  That's not the deprecated method, that's the reasonable method.

I don't use the three-number made-up SCSI-over-USB IDs that Joerg was  
complaining
about being unavailable.  I have mine set up based on the UUID of the  
burner.  I'm
sorry for being unclear, but my objection is to his desire to expose  
the SCSI IDs
to userspace as the primary naming scheme, when said SCSI IDs are  
frequently just
made up by the kernel for USB devices, etc.

Agreed.  My personal gripe is that it screams at me even when I'm  
just doing a
quickie burn of a 60MB debian netinst CD for a one-use-only thing.

Ah, crap.  I just realized that some accidental disk corruption took  
a chunk out of
the middle of my copy of the manpage.  A reinstall of the package  
seems to have
fixed the problem.  Sorry about the noise.
