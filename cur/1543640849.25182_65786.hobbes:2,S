One can read such stuff all the time ... but really this is not possible in a 
general way. You don't know in advance if one runs a ncurses, text-only, 
Qt/Embedded or X-Windows application.

Yes, it's easy to put that in a Qt/Embedded app, but what is when the app 
terminates?  You could not restart it via the keyboard, because the keyboard 
is dead. Yeah, it's cumbersome to restart it with a cell-like keyboard, but 
it's possible.
Anyway, I have to write it low-level, in the kernel. I just wondered if 
something like this already exists.
