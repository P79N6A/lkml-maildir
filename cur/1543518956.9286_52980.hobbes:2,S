This already exists in modutils 2.3.  From man modules.conf
[add] above module module_list
      This  directive makes it possible for one module to "pull in"
      another set of modules on top of itself in a module stack, as
      seen in the output of the lsmod(8) command.  The above directive
      is useful for those circumstances when the dependencies are more
      complex than what can be described in the modules.dep dependency
      file.  This is an optimized case of the post-install and
      pre-remove directives.  Note that failure of installing the
      module will not influence the exit status of modprobe.  The
      optional add prefix adds the new list to the previous list
      instead of replacing it.
There is also a corresponding "below" directive.  modutils 2.3 can be
obtained from 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/modutils/v2.3
 (master) and
ftp://oss.sgi.com//pub/mirror/modutils/v2.3
 (mirror).
