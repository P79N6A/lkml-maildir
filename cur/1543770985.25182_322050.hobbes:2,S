I suspect this is no longer the case, as the -RT development process has
fixed many, many of these bugs.
What would the point of shipping with PREEMPT enabled have been anyway,
when you could still get 20-30ms bumps?  You'd still need huge buffers
for audio to work at all.  Now that PREEMPT in mainline actually works
reasonably (1-2ms by some accounts, also due to side effects of
PREEMPT_RT development) there might be a reason to enable it.
