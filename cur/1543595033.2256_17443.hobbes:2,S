Hi,
It's not actually swapping unless you see IO (si/so).  It's allocating
swap space, but won't send pages out to disk unless there's demand. One
benefit of this early allocation is that idle pages will be identified
prior to demand, and will be moved out of the way sooner.  Watch as
memory demand rises, and you should see these pages migrating to disk
and staying there.. buys you more working space.
