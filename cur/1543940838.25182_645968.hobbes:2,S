I never said it didn't fix a bug.  I'm just reflecting that all of the
problems would go away and we'd save thousands of person hours on the
infrastructure and bug fixing if we simply #defined most of the
sectional annotations to be nops.
My basic question is "is the value of what all of this buys us
(basically a few hundred k in savings)" worth all the investment we're
putting into it.  Particularly as it looks like that investment is
becoming increasingly expensive.

Perhaps you have different figures, but my standard kernel linking ones
tell me that the discard sections only save tens of k (not hundreds that
the init ones save), so I really do think they have no real benefit and
land us huge problems of pointer references into discarded sections.
I don't deny we can invest large amounts of work to fix our current
issues and build large scriptable checks to ensure we keep it fixed ...
I'm just asking if, at the end of the day, it's really worth it.
