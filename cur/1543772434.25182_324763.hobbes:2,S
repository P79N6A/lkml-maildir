Indeed, this is on our list.

On this issue, it has to be said that I don't think any set of test
results will suffice on its own as a definitive benchmark. There will
be a need for continued testing and publication of said results, which
we hope others will take part in when we publish the framework we've put
together.

Philippe can correct me if I'm wrong, but adeos maintenance is not that
difficult. However, it has to be said that up until now, Philippe has been
the main driving force behind adeos. So while he's been fairly good at
publishing patches for as recent a kernel as possible, the manpower behind
PREEMPT_RT is obviously larger. That, though, only requires interested
parties to participate for it to change. Again, the adeos patch isn't
that big.

If you've got any specific test run suggestions, we'll gladly take them.
