   H guys, recently i have narrowed down the problem
 with my modem what had pissed me off for a long time:_
 before i thought it was ppp problem, because my small_
 brain maked that simple logic chain: if ppp0 iface err
 count grows -> tis is ppp problems.___________________
  The fact is what the actual problem touches only
 serial port in 2,4, not 2.2.__
 it looks like that:  each time i enter minicom_______
 and request some info from my modem (ati6 or someth)__
 an fixed amount is going excellent, but then things___
 goes worse: second ati6 answer is HEAVILY corrupted___
 alot of chars is gone, some had come..._______________
    in msdos such a problem does NOT exist______ additional info: it sligtly depends on LDEV sample time
   
   i use an `95 year 486 mboard with am5x86
  p.s. with internal modems this problem is not that
  chilling
                     thanx guys
