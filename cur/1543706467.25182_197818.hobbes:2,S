Hi, I have a Xeon 2 SMP machine, and install a TurboLinux 6.0 with kernel
2.2.18-2xx.
When I boot unique processor kernel, everything is OK. when I boot
symmetric multiple processor kernel, there are only two lines displayed on
console:
and then kernel hang up.
I wonder if kernel 2.2 does not support Xeon 2 SMP. If Kernel 2.2 really
doesn't support Xeon2 SMP, I'll have to give up ....
Thanks for you all.
