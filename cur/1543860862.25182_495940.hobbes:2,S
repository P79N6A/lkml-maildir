Sorry, I thought you meant you would need to update it *further*. I applied 
the patch you gave to Andrew with this result so far:
$ dmesg | grep -A1 "spurious interrupt"
ata1: spurious interrupt (irq_stat 0x8 active_tag 0xfafbfcfd sactive 0x0)
ata1: issue=0x0 SAct=0x0 SDB_FIS=004040a1:00000008
--
ata1: spurious interrupt (irq_stat 0x8 active_tag 0xfafbfcfd sactive 0x0)
ata1: issue=0x0 SAct=0x0 SDB_FIS=004040a1:00000001
No luck yet triggering the exception.

Blacklisting NCQ on the drive(s) for all controllers might be ill advised, 
since it could be a JMicron-specific issue (or ahci-specific, since the 
person in the thread I referenced had a different ahci controller..). 
Either that, or both our drive models have "lousy NCQ"..
Thanks,
