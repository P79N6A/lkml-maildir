Definitely not showstoppers, but nice touches just to ensure that all
things work as expected.  The ones of most importance as I see it are
the get/set_settings ones, which you can just pass-thru to the
mii_ethtool_Xset() calls and get_drvinfo().  All others are somewhat
optional and do vary from device to device.
