This is first thing to wonder about - this indicates that the PCMCIA
bridge did not report that it had turned on the power to the socket
after the time allowed.
Could you give some info on the PCMCIA hardware in this machine please?

Hmm, it seems that we found two ports on this card, one at 0x3f8 and one
at 0x400.  It also seems that there's something odd going on with IRQ3
here, which could be the cause of your problem.

Could you monitor /proc/tty/driver/serial and /proc/interrupts while
you're trying to talk to the card ?

This log seems unreadable - it seems to claim to be a text/plain
ISO8859-1 file, yet it's actually encoded using UTF-16.  I do not
appear to have anything which will convert UTF-16 to standard ASCII.
