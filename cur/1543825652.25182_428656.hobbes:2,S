After a quick check, the reference counts after the
acpi_ns_evaluate_by_handle() call in acpi_ev_execute_reg_method look
like this (they were both 1 before this call):
  params[0]->common.reference_count = 1
  params[1]->common.reference_count = 2
and therefore acpi_ut_remove_reference() doesn't free
params[1]. Kmemleak, however, cannot find the params[1] value while
scanning the memory and therefore reports it as a leak.
Is this normal behaviour for the acpi_ev_execute_reg_method function?
There isn't anything obvious looking at the calling tree (which I
would say is pretty complex).
