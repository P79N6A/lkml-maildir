OK that means Kimball should test the kernel with gsi_irq_sharing() and
without the compression code in mp_register_gsi() which should work for
him (and certainly for ES7000). I am not sure about VIA though, since
they still want PCI IRQs below 16. That means moving the VIA workaround
(and subsequently the one for Stratus :) to gsi_irq_sharing() I suspect.
