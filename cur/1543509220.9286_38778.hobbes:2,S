    Boot messages report the wrong geometry as well.  These newer drives use a
    EIDE command to get the correct geometry and typically, at least in modern
    times, don't rely on the information in CMOS since it can be incorrect.

Ah - you are naive.  There is no `correct geometry'.
But there is a geometry reported by the disk (two geometries, in fact).
And there is a correct geometry for doing I/O (if LBA is not used).
And there is a correct geometry for booting, for LILO to use.
And there is a correct geometry for interaction with other
operating systems - the one that everybody agrees upon for the
interpretation of the partition table.
These geometries differ in general.
The disk here reports 3400 cylinders, 16 heads and 63 sectors per track.
For the partition table you would have liked 850 cylinders, 64 heads,
and 63 sectors per track.
It sounds as if you told the computer in the CMOS setup not to use
more than 780 cylinders.
If that is the case, then just correct that, and the problem is gone.
Otherwise I would like to see more precise data.
