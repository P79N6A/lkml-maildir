One important thing to note: all of the RCU patches
we have constructed have shown benefit.  Since we
have not been very selective in choosing what patches
to generate, it seems a reasonable guess that other
parts of Linux would benefit as well.  There is no
shortage of read-mostly data structures in Linux!
                        Thanx, Paul
