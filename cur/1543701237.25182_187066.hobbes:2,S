Ok, the binary search led me to a changeset between 2.5.25 and 2.5.26
kernels.  Further investigation led me to i8042.c, specifically this:
static void __init i8042_start_polling(void)
{
        i8042_ctr &= ~I8042_CTR_KBDDIS;
        if (i8042_aux_values.exists)
                i8042_ctr &= ~I8042_CTR_AUXDIS;
        if (i8042_command(&i8042_ctr, I8042_CMD_CTL_WCTR)) {
                printk(KERN_WARNING "i8042.c: Can't write CTR while starting polling.\n");
                return;
        }
//      i8042_timer.function = i8042_timer_func;
//      mod_timer(&i8042_timer, jiffies + I8042_POLL_PERIOD);
}
With the function as above, the observed behaviour is as follows:
- don't call i8042_start_polling at all - suspend works
- call i8042_start_polling - suspend fails
It seems that my BIOS is taking exception to CTR value we're writing.
My next step will be to try this with 2.6.0 and see whether this is the
only issue affecting APM suspend.  In the mean time, does Vojtech have
any hints?
