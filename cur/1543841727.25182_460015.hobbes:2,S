Ehm... Now I'm a bit confused. At the point of a bus error, there
difference between the data sent to the bus and the data successfully
received by the card should amount to one block (as the last block got
NACK:ed for whatever reason). If we expect host drivers to report the
bytes sent to the bus, we need to subtract one block from the value
reported to the block layer.
