Subject: [patch 0/2]  Improve the markup_oops.pl script

Hi,
the following 2 patches enhance the markup_oops.pl script in two ways
Patch 1: Add support for putting register values in the asm dump
Patch 2: Add support for 64 bit X86
The output (on a 32 bit OS with a "make me oops" example module) looks like
the pasted dump; for the instruction where the oops happened, as well as
a few instructions before that where the dumper can determine the register value.
the value is appended on said line.
 	if (bar-1) { 
 f8436012:	8b 45 fc             	mov    -0x4(%ebp),%eax 
 f8436015:	48                   	dec    %eax 
 f8436016:	74 09                	je     f8436021 <foo_bar+0x21> 
 		bar = bar * 5; 
 f8436018:	8b 45 fc             	mov    -0x4(%ebp),%eax 
 f843601b:	8d 04 80             	lea    (%eax,%eax,4),%eax  |  %eax => 0 
 f843601e:	89 45 fc             	mov    %eax,-0x4(%ebp)     |  %eax = 0 
 	} 
 	*foo = 1; 
*f8436021:	c6 02 01             	movb   $0x1,(%edx)         |  %edx = 0 <--- faulting instruction
 	return bar; 
 f8436024:	8b 45 fc             	mov    -0x4(%ebp),%eax 
 } 
 f8436027:	c9                   	leave   
 f8436028:	c3                   	ret
