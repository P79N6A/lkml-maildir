For efficiency reasons, the kernel and userspace have to share
the same 4GB virtual address area. By default this area is split
3:1, with 3GB virtual space available for user programs and 1GB
for the kernel.
I suspect in your case it may be worth it to change the kernel
to use 2GB of virtual address space for itself and only let
userspace have 2GB...

Rik
