Yeah, and the flush lock is something we can't really use either of those
for as we require both the multi-process lock/unlock behaviour and the
mutual exclusion that a semaphore provides.
So I guess that means it's only the ilock nesting that is of issue here,
so that means right now a max lock depth of 40 would probably be ok....
Cheers,
