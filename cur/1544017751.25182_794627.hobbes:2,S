Though the bios is the culprit and this option will severely limit
the cpu capabilities that OS can take advantage of, OS should fallback
to a safer mode. I will have a patch for it.
Also, I wonder, if we should complain/scream during boot if we find only
fewer cpuid levels on modern generation cpu's.
