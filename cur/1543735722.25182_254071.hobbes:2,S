Chicken egg by design perhaps, but I can't see
why it have to be that way.

A better way:
Enable the quota at mount time.  If the system isn't ready
for that, i.e. the quota files aren't created/updated - then
refuse the mount.  (Alternatively, mount without quota and
log a complaint.) The administrator can then mount
without quota, run checkquota, and  mount /fs -o remount,usrquota
to turn quota on.
In other words:
quotaon becomes mount -o remount,usrquota
quotaoff becomes mount -o remount,nousrquota
(And/or grpquota of course)
Does it have to be any more complicated than that?

What I don't get is why we have to mount with quota options
that aren't acutally used, and then turn quota on.
Why not mount without quota, and then remount with
quota options when enabling quota for the first time?
The common case should be a fs that was shut down
cleanly and was mounted with quota the last time it
was used.  So it should be able to mount directly
with quota on, because all the on-disk quota information
is valid and up to date.
