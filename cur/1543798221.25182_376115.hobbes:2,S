You're wrong.
Isn't it a part of your code:
static inline ssize_t spi_w8r8(struct spi_device *spi, u8 cmd)
{
        ssize_t                 status;
        u8                      result;
        status = spi_write_then_read(spi, &cmd, 1, &result, 1);
        /* return negative errno or unsigned value */
        return (status < 0) ? status : result;
}
You're allocating u8 var on stack, then allocate a 1-byte-long buffer 
and copy the data instead of letting the controller driver decide 
whether this allocation/copy is necessary or not. And in 99% cases it's 
not gonna be necessary as any controller driver w/o brain damage will 
transfer this as PIO.
So the overhead for sending/receiving 1 byte will be _very big_ 
(trylock, kmalloc, memcpy). See now what I'm talking about?

I meant kmalloc'ing/kfree'ing buffers is spi_w8r8/spi_w8r16/etc.
