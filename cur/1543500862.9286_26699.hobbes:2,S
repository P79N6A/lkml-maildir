You don't need this and I don't need this, but think about the persons
who are installing Linux as an Internet Communications tool instead
of W$. They don't know anything about the inner workings of any OS.
They only know that they are sick and tired of reinstalling W$ ever time
their favorite Chat-Room is down.
I think a 'Peter Norton Utility' for Linux is a great idea and since
Linux has now "arrived", somebody might ask Symantec about it.
Cheers,
