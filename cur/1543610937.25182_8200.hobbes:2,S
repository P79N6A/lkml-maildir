This of course is subject to a race -- the chaff may not execute before the 
gcc has spun off a child or two.

I like this one *much* better, it is functionally equivalant to  cpuselect, 
if one puts parens
around the whole thing to keep  chaff from infecting with a bias subsequent 
commands.
It ideal solution might be to add nohup-like capability to the existing 
chaff command:
        ./chaff 0x6 $$ 1234 43213 ... lots of other pids ...  (note my 
proposed reversal of pid & bias)
        ./chaff 0x6 -c gcc -c module.c
