Yes, that is one of the problems with hardware raid controllers.  If you 
can figure out the controller's metadata format, possibly by asking 
adaptec, or reverse engineering, then patching dmraid to understand that 
format ( it already understands several used by fakeraid controllers ) 
should be rather easy.
