Wouah, i'm very proud to speak to Alan Cox, so it's my first bug report
on the kernel :)
BUg is also  on the bugzilla
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4076
I've also made a patch, my first too :))) :
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=4450&action=view
I don't know if the patch is correct, but i think
Should I do some other thing ?
Good bye
Simon
