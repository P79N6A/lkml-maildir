Well, I _think_ it is safe, although I can't prove it.

No, it's not that bad.  The majority of user land tasks are not uninterruptible
and if they are, then usually for a very short time only.

I don't think that this is possible in normal conditions.  It would be possible
if, for example, the task were waiting for an unavailable resource and that
resource became available after the hibernation image had been created.
In that case, however, to do any damage, the task would have to cause some
filesystem-related data to be flushed in the same syscall (ie. before returning
to user space).
Such situations may be prevented by a mechanizm detecting if any uniterruptible
and freezing task has been woken up after creating the image and aborting the
hibernation in that cases.  For this purpose, we only need to add an
appropriate condition to try_to_wake_up() and make it start to trigger after,
for example, enabling the nonboot CPUs.

Well, the main difficluty with that would be to convince people to use it. ;-)

Right now, it sometimes fails to freeze all tasks that in theory should be
freezable.  Investigating.
