Let me see if I understand this correctly.
Writing this BAR with 0xffffffff causes it to decode all further mmconfig
references based at addr 0xfxxxxxxx as its own?
If I've got that right, then why don't any of the other BARs do that? Is
it because this one's a 64-bit BAR?
AFIK, there are no devices out there that require 32-bits of address
space, so using 0xdfffffff in the low register would certainly work.
However, the PCI spec says that we should be able to write 0xffffffff
to the BAR, buggy BIOS and hardware notwithstanding.
Does anybody see that change as being within the purview of the patch-set
I am proposing? Or is that another patch for another time?
