What kernel are you looking at?  Take a look at current 2.6 and you
should find it much more uniform.

I don't see why it'd be necessary.

Current daemonize api includes name.

Current daemonize function does this.

Yes it's required.

Current daemonize gets this right.

Not necessarily, modules can handle this in other ways (killing thread
on unload, for example).

To give thread proper security credentials.
