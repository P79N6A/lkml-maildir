verify() will now be called after ops->name has been referenced, so these 
checks won't be necessary now.

It's not going to return after BUG(), and actually, you can probably just 
rely on the subsequent oops (i.e. no check needed).

I still think you should use a spinlock here to make the semantics 
simpler.  Dispense with the confusingly named security_ops_enabled, and 
fill chosen_lsm in with the first lsm to regsiter if none chosen at boot.

These messages are not going to scale, e.g. what if there are 20 LSMs 
compiled in, and they all print this on boot? Just print the chosen LSM 
in security_module_enabled().
