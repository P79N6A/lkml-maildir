Hi Christoph & others.
Does anyone see a good way to provide a framework to auto-generate
user-space headers from the kernel versions?
hpa IIRC suggested to create a separate directory:
include/abi
and then all relevant parts of the kernel should publish their public
interface in the abi directory. Would that be usefull?
Another way could be to preprocess headerfiles, and store the output
in an abi directory.
Either way it could be good to have a sketch outlined, then
something could be made in 2.7 about this.
