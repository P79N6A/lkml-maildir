Why are you using USER_HZ? Did you test this with HZ!=100?
Anyway, please don't make more complicated than it already is.
What I said previously about the update interval is still valid, so the 
correct solution is to use the simpler NTP_INTERVAL_LENGTH calculation 
from my last mail and to omit the correction for NO_HZ.
