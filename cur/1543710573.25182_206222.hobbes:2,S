No, that looks more magical and even worse.  The idea of the subarch
code is to separate out pieces of i386/kernel that need to be added in
separately.  Having trampoline depend on CONFIG_X86_TRAMPOLINE which
then depends on (X86_SMP) || (VOYAGER && SMP) expresses exactly what's
going on.  The above code is begging for someone to try to "correct" it.

Actually, no, it's not a discontig mem subarch.  It has a different SMP
setup (VICs instead of APICs...and the failing beast is the QIC which
uses cache line interference to transmit cross processor interrupts
using the last page of physical memory).

That's OK.  Subarch boot sequences are one of the most fragile things in
the kernel.  I suspect the ioremap problem is probably a manifestation
of something happening earlier ... I'll see if I can find it.
