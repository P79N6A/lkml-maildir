For sure. Most arch patches need to go through some refactoring anyway
when preparing them for upstream. Cleaning up no longer required hooks
should be no problem at this chance.
If you want to accelerate this process, please check out Jason's
linux-2.6-kgdb.git for 2.6.25 and start rebasing the powerpc patch. He
just recently said that support around kgdb for non-x86 would be highly
welcome. And if you stumble over ppc-related issues that cannot be
solved with latest kgdb design, please let us know. The sooner, the better.
