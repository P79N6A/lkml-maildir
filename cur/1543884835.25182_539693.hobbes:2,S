We are still seeing a 5% regression on TCP streaming with
slub_min_objects set at 16 and a 10% regression for Volanomark, after
increasing slub_min_objects to 16 and setting slub_max_order=4 and using
the 2.6.21-rc7-mm2 kernel.  The performance between slub_min_objects=8
and 16 are similar.

We've switched to 2.6.21-rc7-mm2 in our tests now.

The order used is 0 for the buffer_head, which is the most used object.
I think they are 104 bytes per object.
