Code bumps the reference count of couple of pages that hold task_struct
when it opens the file.
Thus when task exits they won't be freed and won't be reused. Checking
that exit had already happened is trivial (and done).  And for anything
long said lock is held only while we acquire the reference
to task_struct component.
When you finally release the dentry of /proc/<pid> (and thus are guaranteed
that none of its children are used) you drop the reference to these two pages.
If process had exited while you were holding them - well, that's when
they are freed.
I really wonder what you've managed to reproduce - normal behaviour is
that as soon as task exits you can't access /proc/<pid> and any
access to already opened files in it fails with -ENOENT. Had you been
able to get something else?
