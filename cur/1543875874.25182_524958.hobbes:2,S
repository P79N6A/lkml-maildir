Oh. The quicklist were actually taken from existing IA64 code. Not my idea 
either. I am not wedded to any solution and I was certainly not intending
to abscond with your idea. Would have been difficult given that there was 
a signoff line with your name on it.

Ummm..... So nothing concrete on the performance issues that we 
are considering here? We are talking about something that was lost
a couple of years ago? There are certainly other people who will have the 
same ideas given enough time. Software and patches age like groceries. 
Hiding them will just make them wither away.
