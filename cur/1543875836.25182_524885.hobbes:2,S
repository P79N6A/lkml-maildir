Its probably easier to set the number of cached pages to one.

Tried this also on x86_64 with an enhanced quicklist patch that also deals 
with ptes (at the price of not guaranteeing the free after the tlb flush):
quicklist:
real    8m56.787s
user    7m46.380s
sys     0m55.910s
real    8m58.326s
user    7m46.030s
sys     0m56.250s
real    8m56.900s
user    7m46.620s
sys     0m55.570s
no quicklist:
real    9m7.798s
user    7m48.340s
sys     0m58.360s
real    8m58.994s
user    7m47.980s
sys     0m54.870s
real    8m58.533s
user    7m48.030s
sys     0m54.150s
Seems that there is a slight benefit but its also barely above noise 
level.
