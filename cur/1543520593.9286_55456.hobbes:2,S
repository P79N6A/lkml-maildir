I recently did something like this.  I wrote a program called ptproxy that
uses ptrace() to catch ptrace() and wait() syscalls made by a debugger.
Then ptrace implemented these syscalls itself, applying them to another
process.
From the README:
ptproxy spawns two children: a debugger and a program to be debugged.
ptproxy catches debugging calls from the debugger and forwards them
to the debugged program.  The results are passed back to the debugger.
