nope - it was RK05 (2.5 MB disk). The distribution was on tape, not disk. (9 
track tapes were only 20 bucks, RKs were several thousand).
RLs did not show up for almost 10 years.
RM05 was a 600 MB disk, and didn't show up until after the PDP11/70 and VAX/11 
existed (it was a relabled CDC9766 disk I believe).
And it was UNIX v x, where x varied from null (not labeled) and 1 .. 7.
RL distributions did not come from AT&T (Yourden, Inc. was where I got one)
