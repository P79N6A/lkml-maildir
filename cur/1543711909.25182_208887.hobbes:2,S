Hi everyone,
My old email address piggin@cyberone.com.au is having problems so
I am using this new address nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au. Please send
all future messages here.
I haven't been getting most of my mail for the past couple of days
so if you have sent me anything that I haven't answered, please
resend. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Nick
