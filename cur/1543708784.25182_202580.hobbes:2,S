Not that odd - the local CPU is better at computing checksums
than the interface.
Note - there are some optimizations in the network stack
that reduce the effort of actually computing checksums. In
some cases, all that is done is to subtract/add those values
that are changed in making replies/ACKs. This eliminates
having to make a complete checksum evaluation. In others,
the checksum is done during some other operation that requires
a pass through the packet - making the checksum cost negligable.
I'm not the person for a detailed, low level explaination, but
I think this is what you are seeing. The hardware cannot take
advantage of global optimizations - and what you are seeing is
that difference.
