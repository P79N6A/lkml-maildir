Hi there!
  I've just tried to compile a 2.4.0-test8 on an IBM thinkpad T20 and got the   
following error:
  cs46xx.c: 107: warning: `SND_DEV_DSP16' redefined
  /usr/src/linux/include/sound.h: 12: warning: this is the location of the
	previous definition
  cs46xx.c: 2488: cards causes a section type conflict
  cs46xx.c: 2630: warning: `cs_remove' defined but never used
  due to this test8 doesn't compile (had to disable the driver). I tried the
2.2 branch of the kernel (2.2.18pre2) and all went well.  I've mailed this
compilation error to Alan Cox. He answered he'd only work on 2.2 at the moment
and there it runs well...
  TIA,
    Bernd
