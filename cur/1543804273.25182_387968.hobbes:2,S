Your suggestion doesn't do anything here on 2.6.15, but
	echo 192 > /sys/block/<dev>/queue/max_sectors_kb 
	echo 192 > /sys/block/<dev>/queue/read_ahead_kb 
works wonders!
I don't know why, but anything less than 64 and more than 256 makes the queue 
collapse miserably, causing some strange __copy_to_user calls?!?!?
Also, it seems that changing the kernel HZ has some drastic effects on the 
queues.  A simple lilo gets delayed 400% and 200% using 100HZ and 250HZ 
respectively.
