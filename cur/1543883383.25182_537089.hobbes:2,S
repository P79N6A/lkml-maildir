Thanks a lot for the explanation and the patch, now i better understand 
the "problem". Sorry to have bother you with just noise. The patch will 
certainly be of some help with dumb user (who have dump hardware ) 
like me.
I have very appreciate the attention you ( and all other from this feed ) have 
take with me. So a big thanks for your work and the next time (if any), i 
will try to better analyse the problem to avoid unnecessary work.
Vincent
