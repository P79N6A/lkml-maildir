On 32bit: you would have to use read() and write() or mmap() munmap()
mremap() to perform your own paging, since you can't fit 15GB on a 4GB
address space.
On 64bit: you would simply mmap() the whole file and you are done.
Most probably the cost of programming and debugging the hand-made
paging on 32bit machines will cost more than the difference for a
64bit machine.
