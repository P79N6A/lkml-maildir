Something else.
Although it might be related, since DaveJ reports that there are some 
weird bootup issues that come and go:
  "Fedora rawhide kernel stopped booting for a bunch of people, all with 
   686-SMP boxes. I saw it myself too, it hung just after the 'write 
   protecting kernel rodata'.
   It totally puzzled me for a day.  The following day, I rebased to 
   rc4-git4, and the problem "went away".  Nothing in the changesets 
   merged could explain the hangs I saw.
   A few days ago, the exact same bug resurfaced, and like before, the 
   following day, it went into hiding again."
I don't know a whole lot more.
