JACK needs to know the CPU speed in order to be able to use RDTSC for
timing.  Yes that might be "broken" but gettimeofday() is simply not
fast enough for our use, we can't afford the overhead of thousands of
system calls per second.  And until recently 99.999% of desktop machines
had a monotonic TSC so this worked very well.
I don't see how people can say that gettimeofday() is as fast as the
hardware allows, when gettimeofday() just uses RDTSC to interpolate
since the last timer tick but is ~40x slower than RDTSC on my system.
