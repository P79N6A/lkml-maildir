It wasn't... If you look at the patches, you'll notice how it starts with
patch-2.0.21-2.1.0.bz2
patch-2.0.21-2.1.0.bz2.sign
patch-2.0.21-2.1.0.gz
patch-2.0.21-2.1.0.gz.sign
In the course of 2.1, a large part of the kernel was rewritten... but not
all at once, and not really 100% of the code... I think not, anyway.
