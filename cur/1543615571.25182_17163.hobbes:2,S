>What does this device look like in 2.2.18 ?
The above was the output of 'cat /proc/pci' under 2.2.18. The
corresponding output for 2.4.17 is:
   Bus  0, device   5, function  0:
     Class 0000: PCI device 1000:0001 (rev 1)
       IRQ 10
       Master Capable.  Latency=80.
       I/O at 0xd000 [0xd0ff]
       Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x0 [0xff]
I had ordered my mail to include first all output from 2.2.18,
followed by output of 2.4.17.
