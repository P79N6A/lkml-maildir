Subject: 2.6.13 brings buffer underruns when burning DVDs at high speeds (16x)

Hello all,
It seems that something has been broken when passing from 2.6.12 to
2.6.13 regarding the SCSI burning engine. When burning a DVD at 16x
(with ide-cd SEND_PACKET command, or with the SG interface, no matter
the driver used), you get tons of buffer underruns. This was not
appearing in 2.6.12.
I would suspect something in the block devices driver, but I am not
really sure... and I did not have enough time yet to look deeply in the
source code ;-)
Best Regards,
Mathieu
