I also tried it on an AMD64 system (3500+ on A8V Deluxe) and did not 
observe any anomalies, but I am using Gnome, not KDE.
I saw a message that latency tests were wanted, but I don't normally have 
a workload in which this can be observed.  Perhaps someone could provide a 
suggestion?  I did try some dvd-burning sessions.  Subjectively speaking, 
there didn't seem to be any improvement over 2.6.10, and it may have been 
a bit worse.
