The whole discussion is pointless anywhere as long as you are not 
writing the code to implement your proposal.
If you think you could send an idea and other people would implement it 
you are misunderstanding how open source software works.
You have your idea.
It is YOUR job to write the code implementing your proposal.
Then there's a basis for a technical discussion of the advantages and 
disadvantages of your ideas.
Otherwise, you are only wasting your (and our) time since there's 
exactly a 0% probability that someone else will implement your ideas.
