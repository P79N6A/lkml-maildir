Took a quick peek. The Makefile uses "order only" in three spots.
This alone demand make version 3.80 IIRC and Documetnation/Changes
says 3.79.1...
The "order only" is so rare that Paul Smith once said that
coming up with a good example of usage was not easy.
For the headers_* stuff I recall when I reworked it I could
kill the usage of "order only" there but now it crept
back - sigh!
