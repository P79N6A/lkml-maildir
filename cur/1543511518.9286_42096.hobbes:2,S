Make a signal handler for the children (a generic one for all of them).
#include<signal.h>
#include<sys/wait.h>
void reaper(int unused)
{
    while(wait3(&unused, WNOHANG, NULL) > 0)
         ;
}
code()
{
    struct sigaction sa;
    sigaction(SIGCHLD, NULL, &sa);
    sa.sa_handler = reaper;
    sa.sa_flags |= SA_RESTART;
    sigaction(SIGCHLD, &sa, NULL);
    ......
    ......
With this, any child that expires, that has not set up it's own handler,
will be caught and have its status read and thrown away so it can finish
its exit. This way, you will have no zombies.
Cheers,
