Not as wrong - just incomplete: leave the door unlocked, but put a chain
on it. If someone tries to open the door, the chain stops him, you know
the door was tried (and how it was tried). Scream at vendor of door, or
get the source for the door and fix it.
This also prevents him from breaking the window in the door.
The warning is what is what I want. Any burgler can break a door even if
it has an alarm, given enough time. The non-exec stack is only the alarm.
locking the door is more like fixing the stack overflow. A fixed stack
overlow also prevents the "breaking the window".
