I'm no longer planning on this.  In fact, I see a future where I tell
people who want to use sound on ARM to go screw themselves because
there doesn't seem to be an acceptable solution to this problem.
Of course, this will lead to dirty hacks by many people who *REQUIRE*
sound to work, but I guess we just don't care about that.
(Yes, I'm pissed off over this issue.)
