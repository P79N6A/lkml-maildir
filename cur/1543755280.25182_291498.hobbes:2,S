I tried the second patch provided by Scott on a 2.6.10 kernel, I did 
some minor tweaks to get it to apply (changed pci_choose_state() and 
PCI_D0 back to the way they were in 2.6.10) and tested the results five 
minutes ago.
It works great, I havent tried suspending the machine cause I have no 
need for that functionality. I have however started the machine via WOL 
(works), sent WOL-packet to the machine when powered on (nothing 
happends - kacpid doesn't go wild, works), shutdown (works without the 
machine spontaneously rebooting). 
So everything seems to be fixed by the patch (save for suspending which 
I didn't test).
Thanks alot, I hope the patch will be in the next stable 2.6 kernel.
Regards,
David
