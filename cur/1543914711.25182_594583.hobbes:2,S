Contributing doesn't necessarily means submitting patches. There are
several good guys at the community offering very valuable contributions,
like patchset reviews, good comments, userspace experiences, etc.
Johannes does a very impressive work of maintaining, almost alone,
LinuxTV website, upgrading the system, monitoring disk spaces, taking
backups, etc. Also, he is always available to discuss the most important
changes at APIs and to defend the Open Source community, providing his
very clear point of view.
Thank you, Johannes for all your good work!
