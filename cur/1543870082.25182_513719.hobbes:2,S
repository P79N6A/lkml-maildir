Then there is msi and with msi-x you can have up to 4K irqs.

There is some truth there yes.  But for ISA the numbers are really
0 to 15.

Yes.  I should really look at that more and see if I could bring
s390 into the generic irq code with my planned changes.

Largely for pci we already have dev->irq and the device just calls
request_irq to get things going.  The challenge is that the token
in dev->irq get's looked at.

Reasonable if it is easy and straight forward.
Something like pci_request_irq(dev,....) and the helper looks at
dev->irq under the covers and calls request_irq or whatever makes
sense.  Is this what you are thinking.  Examples would help me here.
What I really object to is not the irq numbers.  As an arbitrary number
does not impose limits.  What I object to is drivers that can't handle the
full range of numbers, and the limits imposed upon those numbers when
you require them to be indexes into an array.
For talking to user space I expect we will have numbers for a long time
to come yet.
