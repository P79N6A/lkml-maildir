Right you are.

Indeed this is the case.  I think such global cleanups are, in fact, less
frequent than they should be precisely *because* lkml's social machinery
discourages them.

Yes, if the rare case of supporting global cleanups actually needs to be a
more common one.  Think about that for a while, please.

Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence
of the improbable...A man full of faith is simply one who has lost (or
never had) the capacity for clear and realistic thought. He is not a
mere ass: he is actually ill.
