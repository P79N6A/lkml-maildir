I said crash due to OOM, not due to bugs. I never said anything about bugs.
You can't avoid memory overcommit without dealing with:
	1. mmap()'ed data
	2. stack growth
	3. kernel dynamic memory allocation
...and probably a host of other things I know nothing about. You're
talking about adding a tremendous amount of overhead and complexity for no
real benefit.

It has already been shown on this list that 
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
does not, in fact, disable memory overcommit.

Hey, this is core stuff that has been in the kernel for a very long time.
It's not going to change, and it shouldn't be changed.
