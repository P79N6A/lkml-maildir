Umm... /me scratches head. /me silently suspects that internally these
"hardlinks" are implemented in rather funny ways. /me wants to know how
the green fsck does CHKDSK react on them and what actually happens.

*bingo*
That's what I was proposing.

It takes _less_. Linus, the only (and I mean it) issue is that we will
need to lift the 255-anon-mounts limit. The only problem I have with
podfuk and friends is their attempt to make mounting automatic ("you've
looked funny at foo.tar, we mount it"). If application says "I want to
treat foo.tar as tarfs" (not necessary doing the actual mounting; autofs-like
scheme will work fine) - no problem. And yes, that's a hell of a powerful
thing. Potentially there is a file-becoming-directory thing (confused
userland), but that may be worth saying "fix your userland, then" - amount
of breakage is probably limited.
