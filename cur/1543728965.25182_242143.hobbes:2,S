Hi!
In April there were some patches from Russell King to add MMC support 
into the vanilla kernel. The latest version (2.6.8.1) does not have 
these patches included and I haven't found any more comments about it on 
the list. As I am in the middle of reverse engineering the Windows 
driver for a MMC/SD card reader I'd like to integrate my work with these 
routines. So what is the status of getting them into Linus' kernel and 
is the patch set from april the latest version of the routines?
