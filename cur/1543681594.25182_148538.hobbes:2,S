I'm using XFree86-4.3.0-17, I have the synaptics XF86 0.11.3p6 driver 
installed.
I have input, evdev, mousedev, psmouse in the kernel.
I get happy dmesg output when psmouse loads.
When X starts the cursor sits in the middle of the screen and won't move 
when I touch the touchpad or the buttons.
On the TTY from which I started the X server I see:
Synaptics DeviceInit called
SynapticsCtrl called
Synaptics DeviceOn called
SynapticsCtrl called
SynapticsCtrl called
Synaptics DeviceOff called
This last message looks suspicious. I dunno, maybe it's normal.  Either 
way the touchpad doesn't work.
