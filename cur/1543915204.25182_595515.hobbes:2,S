Actually, they're nothing to do with malloc failures--the message
printed here is misleading, and isn't even an error; it gets printed
whenever an upcall to mountd is made.  The problem is almost certainly a
problem with kernel<->mountd communication--the kernel depends on mountd
to answer questions about exported filesystems as part of the fh_verify
code.
It's just a shot in the dark, but you might try the latest nfs-utils
(get the latest out of git://linux-nfs.org/nfs-utils if you're already
on the most recent your distro will give you).  Or just apply the
following--which did fix a problem whose symptoms varied depending on
libc behavior.
If that doesn't work, I'd try
	strace -s0 `pidof rpc.mountd`
and also look at the contents of /proc/net/rpc/nfsd.fh/contents.

commit dd087896285da9e160e13ee9f7d75381b67895e3

    Use __fpurge to ensure single-line writes to cache files
    On a recent Debian/Sid machine, I saw libc retrying stdio writes that
    returned write errors.  The result is that if an export downcall returns
    an error (which it can in normal operation, since it currently
    (incorrectly) returns -ENOENT on any negative downcall), then subsequent
    downcalls will write multiple lines (including the original line that
    received the error).
    The result is that the server fails to respond to any rpc call that
    refers to an unexported mount point (such as a readdir of a directory
    containing such a mountpoint), so client commands hang.
    I don't know whether this libc behavior is correct or expected, but it
    seems safest to add the __fpurge() (suggested by Neil) to ensure data is
    thrown away.
