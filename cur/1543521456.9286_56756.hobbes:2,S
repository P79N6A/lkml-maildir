Both sb and msp3400 register a mixer device.  By default this works the
"first come, first served" way, i.e. whoever is loaded first gets /dev/mixer0.
You can change this by loading msp3400 with "mixer=1", msp3400 will allways
allocate /dev/mixer1 then and /dev/mixer0 is kept free for sb. (works with
2.3.34+ only).
