Doesn't even exist for that kernel. I only compiled a new
nvidia driver module for one kernel - the one that I am using
on a daily basis.

What would the name be of such module?
In fact, I think that when the kernel does NOT lockup, it
doesn't print this "agpgart: Detected.." line either.
Ie, the dmesg of cf68676222e54cd0a31efd968da00e65f9a0963f
which boots fine, gives:
$ grep Detected dmesg-cf686
time.c: Detected 2666.669 MHz processor.
Detected 16.666 MHz APIC timer.
$ grep agpgart dmesg-cf686
Linux agpgart interface v0.102 (c) Dave Jones
Does that give an indication of what you want me to test/try?
