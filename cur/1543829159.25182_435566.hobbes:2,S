OK, realised out that it's feature. Entries in /proc/sys/net/*/conf/ are 
not created if interface doesn't have at least one ipv4/ipv6 address.
I can think of workarounds for most of problems (although it breaks a hell 
lot of software here), but how I suppose to configure ipv6 settings for 
interfaces which have to obtain global ipv6 address via autoconf so that 
it will work even if cable is not plugged in? I did via /etc/sysctl.conf,
but now ... machine boots with no link => no link-local address => 
no /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interfce> => configuration fails.
