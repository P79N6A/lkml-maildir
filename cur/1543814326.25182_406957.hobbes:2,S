The NO_IDLE_HZ implementation provided here is enabled when the 
VMI-Timer device is used as the timer interrupt source.  The VMI-Timer 
device is only present on paravirtual hardware.
However, the hooks introduced into the kernel (stop_hz_timer, 
restart_hz_timer) with these patches will be approximately the same 
(perhaps a subset) for implementing NO_IDLE_HZ on systems that use other 
interrupt sources.

Certainly we plan to merge our NO_IDLE_HZ implementation with those 
patches once they are stabilized in the kernel.  Presently, they seem to 
be too fast of a moving target to be worth merging at this point, 
though.  Additionally, the VMI-Timer NO_IDLE_HZ implementation does not 
need all the machinery provided with the NO_IDLE_HZ patches that are 
floating around because the VMI-Timer code does not track time by 
counting interrupts.  This leads to a fairly simplistic NO_IDLE_HZ 
implementation.
