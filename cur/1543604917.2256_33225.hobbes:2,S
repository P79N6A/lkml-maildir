I am _not_ saving anything.  Viewing
/home/web/automatically_generated_every_hour.html from a particular
moment is a perfectly reasonable thing to do in Emacs, and it's a
perfectly reasonable thing to do in Less and Midnight Commander and
Mozilla for that matter.
_If_ I hit :x (in Vi-mode in Emacs ;-) then I expect the editor to warn
me that the file was updated by some other program.  Some editors will
warn before that.  Some will reload the file automatically if I haven't
made changed within the editor.
However, at all times I expect a consistent display of the file either
from read time, or from the current time.  _Never_ some unparsable,
invalid, mixed up combination of pages.

I do _not_ want versioning.  I want to load a file into an editor and
look at _that_ snapshot, at my leisure.  (Almost) every editor ever
written works this way, and I am quite happy with it.
read() gives the correct semantics.
There is potential to make read() more efficient, both in execution time
and in memory consumption.
Enjoy :-)
