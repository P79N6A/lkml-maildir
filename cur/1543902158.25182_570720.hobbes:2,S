I know it sounds that way based on the definition (Detected parity error 
on hub side), however I have two other identical systems that have been 
running fine for months - with this same bit set - only they use an 
Adaptec ANA-64044 (4 port card - 10/100 fast ethernet - unfortunately 
discontinued). 
It seems the Pericom PCI to PCI bridge is having a problem talking to 
the LAN controllers behind the Hint bridge.
