OK, but take a look at Michael's second patch. It still looks at
nr_running on every queue in the system (with some slightly strange
code to make a rotating choice on nodes on the case of equality),
so should still be able to make the best decision .... *but* it
seems to be much cheaper to execute. Not sure why at this point,
given the last results I sent you last night ;-)
