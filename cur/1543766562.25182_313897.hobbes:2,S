Preemptive strikes won't work, coz this little target will just redirect
the incoming munitions at his other aggressors ;)
It is good that RH has got this process underway.  David, I assume that
other interested parties (ocfs, lustre, etc) know that this is happening? 
If not, could you please let them know and invite them to comment?

In an ideal world, the various clustering groups would haggle this thing
into shape, come to a consensus patch series which they all can use and I
would never need to look at the code from a decision-making POV.
The world isn't ideal, but merging something over the strenuous objections
of one or more major groups would be quite regrettable - let's hope that
doesn't happen.  Although it might.

OK.  I'm unlikely to merge any first-round patches, as I expect there will
be plenty of review comments and I'm already in a bit of a mess here wrt
patch backlog, email backlog, bug backlog and apparently there have been
some changes in the SCM area...
