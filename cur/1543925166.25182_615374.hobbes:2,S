The disadvantage of migrate_disable() is that it complicates the
load-balancer but more importantly, that it does bring a form of
latencies with it that are hard to measure. Using preempt_disable() for
these current per-cpu users basically forces them to keep it short.
   Which is a GOOD (tm) thing.
If we go overboard with this migrate_disable() stuff we can end up with
a very hard to analyse system that sporadically does weird stuff.
So, please, don't start that again.
