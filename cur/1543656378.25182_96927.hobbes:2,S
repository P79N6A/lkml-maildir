Well, I finally got the system up and running again, after moving, and
ran it without loading any of the md modules (thus nothing modified by
the raid6 code.)  Leaving it running overnight at the shell prompt but
cron jobs running -- including the one that backs up the SCSI drives
onto the IDE drive -- left me with tons of ext3fs error messages in
the morning on the IDE drive in question.
This is unfortunately all the information I have right at the moment.
