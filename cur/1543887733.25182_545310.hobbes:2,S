It had better not. We use that sucker to nuke pagecache when we're trying to
reclaim inodes, for example...

You can drop the lock, do the invalidation, and return AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE. The
new aops patches will provide a better solution, but that will work today.

See #1.

It's fine if you return AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE.

I just mean more generally. simple write(2) writes, for starters.
For shared writable mmap? I don't know... does POSIX require mmap data
to be coherent with read(2)/write(2)? ;)

That's what the invalidate / truncate routines do.
