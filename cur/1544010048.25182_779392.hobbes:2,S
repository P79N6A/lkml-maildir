it is, but of type "u_char __iomem *" (after applying this patch):
+       u_char __iomem  *pci_membase; /* PCI memory (MUST BE BYTE POINTER) */
so thats why we need the cast.
What if we declare plx_acc_32 of type "u_char __iomem *", or both as
"void __iomem *"?
I slightly favor the later, against the LOUD comment.
If plx_membase is declared without __iomem the cast "(u_int __iomem*)" produces
a warning "cast adds address space to expression"
