I would suggest instead that they include a bus type (PCI, USB, 1394, SBus,
etc) so that they can (where available) use the native ID listings.
PCI, SBus, NuBus, MicroChannel, 1394, EISA, and as I recall USB all have
different methods for identifying a device on the bus. It comes out to
matching integer properties where what properties and what values are bus
dependent.
Make the code that matches devices to drivers accept various parameters
dependent on bus allows you to avoid writing this all over again when the
next auto-config bus comes out.

Wouldn't it be cleaner to do a separate driver program that does all this?
Use the existing kmod interface to do the linking and loading, but include
the moddep stuff (that you are talking about having to change anyways) and
make it part of the same program.
You would create a deamon to do device loading. It gets notified by the
kernel each time a new device is added to the bus, and searches (in app
space) for a matching module. Once it finds one, it loads it. Since everyone
keeps on wanting a way for a driver to load a file (for microcode and such),
you could provide the hooks for that at the same time.
In another message you mentioned wondering how to pass parameters. Might I
suggest that the module doing the loading search for a <device>.conf file
whereever it finds the device object file?
Example:
Module is btp.o, named btp.
The new interface would be equivilent to:
/sbin/insmod btp `cat /etc/modules/btp.conf`
Where the btp.conf file is automatically checked for by the insmod or it's
replacement and parsed the same way that parameters would be. Parameters
entered on the command line should override the settings in the file.
