Well, I can live with the app being able to call munlock(), because the apps that our 
customers use don't call munlock().  What I can't live with is a bug in the kernel that 
causes pinned pages to be swapped or moved.
Obviously, I would rather call get_user_pages() instead of mlock(), but I can't, because 
get_user_pages doesn't work.  The page doesn't stay pinned at the physical address, but it 
does if I call mlock() and get_user_pages().
Actually, in our tests, calling mlock() appears to be good enough, but I'll update our 
code to call get_user_pages() as well.
