I was not able to reproduce the results expected from a driver close to
the one which was supposed to work back with 2.6.18-rc4. OTOH, as Lennert
noticed, simply ignoring the PCI data parity errors seems to do the trick.
There are quite a lot of these errors though.
I'll do one or two more tests but the driver will surely be simply added
a big knob to control its behavior when parity errors appear.
