in my 2.4 tree I have this one instead (written in oct 2002):

32bit archs needs to get O_LARGEFILE in return from getfl (if they set
it [it's not set implicitly in 32bit archs] they will be able to handle
it transparently in glibc too, and I believe they really want it). 64bit
archs not, hence the fix.
