yeah. KVM under -rt already works with dynticks enabled on both the host 
and the guest. (but it's more optimal to use a dedicated hypercall to 
set the next guest-interrupt)

yeah, we hope to have it in v2.6.21.
note that s390 (and more recently Xen too) uses a next_timer_interrupt() 
based method to stop the guest tick - which works in terms of reducing 
guest load, but it doesnt stop the host-side interrupt. The highest 
quality approach is to have dynticks on both the host and the guest, and 
this also gives high-resolution timers and a modernized 
time/timer-events subsystem for both the host and the guest.
