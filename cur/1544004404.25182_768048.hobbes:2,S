Yeah, I was thinking of putting in a iter_ctrl to disable them. But then, 
should they be on or off by default?
The pro for having them off by default, they are not as distracting.
The con for having them off by default, they lose their meaning, and 
developers get confused when they see CPU 1 starting after 100 prints of 
CPU0, when they both should have started.
