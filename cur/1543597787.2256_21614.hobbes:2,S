I just purchased an HP Pavilion and was disappointed (but not surprised) to
find out that the suspend button is software driven (at least somewhat).
Needless to say it works great under the OS shipped with the laptop.
I played with apm but it keeps on dying with a APM_FUNC_SET_STATE APM
command not succeeding.  The apm_bios_call_simple fails with an error
stored in EAX of 0x6007; from what I can gether the error code is 0x60.
I would like to get the APM working well on this box.  Can anyone point
me to the APM specs, a better forum for this discussion, or a good
solution.
In the intrem... I have run across many mentions of a 'swsuspend' patch.
Where can I find this patch?
Regards,
Bart.
