Sure, that's clean, From that perspective the apic is a bunch of
registers backed by a state machine or something.  It's not particularly
clean from a high-level interface perspective because those calls don't
mean anything, but that just means pv_ops is the wrong interface for
those calls. genapic, from its name alone, sounds like it should be the
right place to hook in at that level; if it isn't, it sounds like the
right starting place.

Yes, but couldn't you, oh I don't know, have the virtual timer
interrupts come in on irq 97, and just register a handler for that irq
and use that ISR to drive the time stuff?  Then its logically identical
to the Xen code or any other free-standing device driver.
Making your virtual timer device share interrupts with the (emulated)
real-time device seems to be making things messy (is that right, is that
the issue?).  I don't see why UP vs SMP is an issue here at all, or why
the PIT gets involved in any way (and I don't mean that in a "I think
your design is idiotic" way, I mean that in a "I don't really understand
the problem domain, so I'm missing something in your explanations" way).
