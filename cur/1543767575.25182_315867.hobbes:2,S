Hm, I patched the kernel with 2.6.11-libata-dev1, compiled it with
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y   (for the motherboard IDE)
CONFIG_SCSI=y
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y
CONFIG_SCSI_PATA_PDC2027X=y
and rebooted. SCSI is initialized and the pata_pdc2027x driver is
loaded, but it doesn't seem to find any devices. Or maybe it doesn't
look for devices at all. I can tell that it's loaded by the existence
of /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pata_pdc2027x (a directory which is empty).
/proc/scsi/scsi is also empty besides the "Attached devices:" line.
During startup the kernel does say "Probing IDE interface ide0"
through "ide5" (finding only devices on ide0). I also tried compiling
pata_pdc2027x as a module, with same result.
What's wrong here?
