Sounds very good! :-) However, can this be kept up for, say 3 hours?
(Off course, this means that files will be reused or overwritten several
times, but that's irrelevant, as caching has no effect on this ammount
of data.) This is usually the hard part... The file system may NOT
decide to do some clean up work every now and then - we can't use THAT
big buffers.)
