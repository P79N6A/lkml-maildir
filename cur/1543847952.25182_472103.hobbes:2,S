I think the API you proposed is horrible.  Having jiffies exposed in
ani API is a mistake, and adding more makes this problem worse.  I'd suggest
to start with Alan's patches that add a timer variant that takes a miliseconds
argument instead of jiffies and add a _rounded varaint to it that has
a new parameter that specifies the precision.
