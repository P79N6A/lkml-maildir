Almost all of this was in the first locking patch, which was probably
shorter than this description.

Agreed, will add to my list.

Ok, well this piece remains oopsable by inspection, though it is root
only. See free_entropy_store:
        if (r->pool)
                kfree(r->pool);
        kfree(r);
..while r and r->pool are potentially being used concurrently.

Ok. I've significantly improved the instrumentation and will be happy
to post test cases along with my next fixes too. All the controversial
things are at the end of my queue, as well (the present controversy
was not about something I'd submitted for inclusion). 
If anyone's interested, I have a preliminary Debian package for NIST's
RNG statistical test suite too (though this is only good as a sanity
check).

I can probably break this into a bunch of pieces if the two its
already in don't seem obvious enough on their own.
