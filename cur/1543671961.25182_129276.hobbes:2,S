Hi Thomas,
With this patch, vesafb doesn't work anymore on my vaio notebook in 1400x1050
nor 1280x1024, because scree_info.lfb_size is reported to be 127, while it
should be 175 and 160 instead ! So I modified your patch a little bit to get it
right :
- video_size          = screen_info.lfb_size * screen_info.lfb_height * video_bpp;
+ video_size          = screen_info.lfb_width/8 * screen_info.lfb_height * video_bpp;
and it now works again.
Maybe I have a broken bios, but other people might have the problem too.
Cheers,
Willy
