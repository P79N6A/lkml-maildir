Nop. I will continue to develop under the v4 banner. As far as I'm
concerned Peter Anvin has claimed v5 and I don't want to challenge that.
Mike Waychisons' initiative may possibly be called v6???
In any case the module works fine with v3 and v4 (I haven't tested
4.0.0pre10 for a while though). The 4.1 daemon detects the enhanced module
if present. It is currently dubed 4.04. The 'plays well with others' is a
self imposed design requirement.
