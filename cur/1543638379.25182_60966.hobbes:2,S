Well I added that message when switching to the 2.5 style request
mapping functions, and I think the message is perfectly clear :-). Never
the less, it means that a segment that came into the ide layer with an
advertised size of 1 segment was returned from blk_rq_map_sg() as having
_two_. This can be a problem with dynamically allocated sg table (not
that ide uses those, but still).
It's a bug and usually a critical one when this happens. I'd be inclined
to think that Adam's changes in this path are to blame for this error.
Oh, and I'd be _really_ careful if you have trusted data on that drive
(surely not when running 2.5 ide on it :-)
