The security_bprm_secureexec hook can be used to cause the AT_SECURE
flag to be set in the ELF auxiliary table, and glibc now uses that flag
to determine whether to enable secure mode.  You would need to patch
cap_bprm_secureexec to do the right thing, but otherwise the support is
ready.  SELinux uses this to enable glibc secure mode for role/domain
changes.
