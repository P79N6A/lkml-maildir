Does this combination make sense?  If you are building a pnpbios driver
into the kernel then the configuration should force pnpbios support to
be built in as well.  We don't allow this combination for things like
scsi or ide, they require the common support to be built in if any
drivers are built in.  IMHO this problem should be fixed in .config,
not in driver source.
