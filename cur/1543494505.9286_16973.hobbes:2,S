Exec summary: Are there known problems with knfsd 0.4.22 quota on truncation ?
              Also: should locking work on non world readable files ?
Fully gory details ....
I have knfsd 0.4.22 on Linux 2.2.[0-7], basically for the user land 
programmes. I find it really hard to keep track of which bits of knfsd are std 
in the kernel, which bits are "optional" patches to add new features (like NFS 
V3), which bits are bug fixes, and which bits are required patches.
This has resulted in me using out of date (0.4.22 vs 1.2) knfsd user space 
commands. No problem, except that it appears that if a file is truncated 
(rather than deleted) over NFS, the amount of space marked as `used' by that 
user does not go down.
Is this a known problem ? Will knfsd 1.2 fix it ? If so, what patches do I 
need to apply to 2.2.7 ?
Also, I find that whereas locking works in general, I have instances when a 
simple remote perl lock command fails if the file being locked (e.g. a .mail 
file) isn't world readable :-(
It appears that when nlm_lookup_file calls nlmsvc_ops->fopen, current->fsuid 
is (for *SOME* clients hosts) set to "nobody", rather the actual user, with 
the result that locking fails.  Ideas ?
