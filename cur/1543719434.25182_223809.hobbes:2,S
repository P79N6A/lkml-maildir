fsck.xfs is a nop.  It intentionally doesn't do anything... if you've
reached a point where the filesystem *needs* to be checked and repaired,
you don't want any part of it to be automated.
And most distro's these days will needlessly run fsck everytime it's
been shutdown "improperly" (where "improperly" is defined as a file
didn't get deleted.)
