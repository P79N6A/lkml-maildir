Bah, couldn't care less :-) If all else fails, you can fall back
to the "old-style" boot loader, and let this one boot the legacy
OS. (Well, for GRUB, you'd need the fallback extension, if this
isn't a standard feature yet.)

I think many of them would just be as happy with a more complex
solution, as long as it comes in a nice bundle. Of course, if
there is no nice package to start from, they'll only implement
the bare minimum.
Also, in most cases, we can probably ignore space issues for now,
leave some room for experiments, and optimize later.

Yes, that's what I mean with it being in "mainline". For user
space to begin making use of kexec, it really should be part of
a kernel most people can accept for regular use.

Trying to, by explaining why it should move on :-) Anything else
you need ?
