Auch yes, ok nevermind that last email. There really is no way around
allocating an extra 'pad' entry right now, so the SCSI_MAX_SG_SEGMENTS
at 129 should fix Ingo's oops and the other crap is void.

Big diff is not a problem for me, my primary concern would be making
sure that the interface is solid. The above also has the nice side
effect of making all sg elements usable, so we don't waste any. IIRC
this was even debated months ago when I first proposed sg chaining, I
shied away from it because I thought it would seem huge and too
invasive. Ah well. I'll get digging on this.
