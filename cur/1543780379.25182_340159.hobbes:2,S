A struct page ain't an inode.  So I'm assuming you mean something like
"giving a struct page that is known to be part of the inode slab
cache".
In that case, you have to decide how intimate you want the slab code
and your page/inode reclaim code to be.  You could use slab structures
to find out the (ofs,len) tupel of contained structures, cast those
to a struct inode and then continue.  Whether you actually want that,
depends on your moral standards.
