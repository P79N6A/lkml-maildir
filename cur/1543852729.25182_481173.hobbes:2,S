So you have 4GB RAM, and most likely some memory is remapped above the
4GB address boundary.  Could you show the full dmesg output after boot?
Other things you can try:
 - Boot with mem=3072M (or some larger value which is still less than
   the amount of RAM below the 4GB boundary - the exact value could be
   found from the dmesg output) and check whether you can reproduce the
   corruption in this configuration.
 - Look in the BIOS setup for memory remapping options (Google indicates
   that it may be called "Hammer Configuration/Memory Hole Mapping" on
   this board).  Maybe you need to try different values (AFAIR there
   were some complaints about unstabilities with software remapping;
   cannot find the exact page now).
