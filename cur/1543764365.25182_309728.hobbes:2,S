For reordering, using patcher, you can simply edit the sequence file
and move lines around.  Nice and simple interface.
There is no checking involved, though.  If you mode dependent patches,
you end up with a mess and either throw it all away or seriously
scratch your head.  So a serious SCM might do something like this:
$ cp series new_series
$ vi new_series
$ SCM --reorder new_series
  # essentially "mv new_series series", if no checks fail
Merging patches isn't that hard either.  Splitting them would remain
manual, as you described it.

Amen!
