Actually, the right way to do it is with the cycle counting register,
adding code to the system call entry and exit points.  And you need to add
some more smarts for things that sleep, probably in switchto. But this of
course adds overhead and requires changing the code.
This also doesn't get to the question of how to account for interrupts,
networking, etc.
