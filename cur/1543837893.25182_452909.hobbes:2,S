Mmm.. that's interesting.. this time, the scaling_max_freq went back up
to 1100000 all by itself after a longish idle period, before which it had
dropped to 800000 and got "stuck" there.
Currently using the "ondemand" governor -- it doesn't seem to call the
central cpufreq_debug_printk() thingie from cpufreq.c.
I did hack cpufreq_debug_printk() to force output anytime it gets called,
but still no new output in the logs.
Cheers
