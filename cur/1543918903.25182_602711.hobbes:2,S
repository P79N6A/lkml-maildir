Andy, Ingo,
I tried the new checkpatch.pl on 2.6.23-rc9:
$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -q --file --emacs fs/namei.c
and got many perl warnings such as:
Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at ./scripts/checkpatch.pl line 455.
followed by the usual verbose error message instead of one-per-line as I
assume the --emacs option is supposed to produce:
:2823: WARNING: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its function/variable
#2823: FILE: namei.c:2820:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(vfs_mkdir);
BTW, calling the option --emacs is a bit too restrictive.  Emacs didn't
invent the format of "filename:linenumeber:message".  C compilers had it
before.  Even "grep -n *" had it before.  That's why I think calling it a
"terse output" option may be more accurate.
The following small patch to checkpath.pl-next seems to fix the perl
warnings, but it still outputs the long error messages along with the
shorter one-liners.
