I want to install on a RAID volume controlled by a Mylex 170.
Built an image of a 2.4.1 with DAC960/DAC1100 "compiled in" and copied
it over vmlinuz on a Red Hat 7 boot diskette (boot.img).
I entered this at the boot prompt
boot: linux root=/dev/rd/c0d0
DAC960 appears to detect correctly the volume
[...]
Kernel panic: I have no root and I want to scream
[...]
DAC960#0: Logical Drive 0 (/dev/rd/c0d0) Found
DAC960#0: Logical Drive 0 (/dev/rd/c0d0) Online
It seems the kernel wants a root before it becomes Online.
What now?
