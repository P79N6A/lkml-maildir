I was referring to the visibility of server-side mount points in NFS 2/3
and the fact that most of the uses of the automounter is to work around
this shortcoming.  This is a protocol limitation.
(Don't get me started on stuff like "plus lines" in map, which breaks
the map paradigm completely.  That's brokenness on a whole other level,
but which can be reasonably ignored.)

Again, it doesn't matter if the user passes credentials to an
automounter or to the kernel.

It's trivial to crash most filesystem drivers (or get to a security leak
level) by feeding them deliberately bad input.  Robustness against
corruption in Linux has been with respect to likely data corruption much
more than deliberate attacks.  It's a major effort; security-auditing
every filesystem driver.
