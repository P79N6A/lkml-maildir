We haven't done it before (afaik), and I don't think we've had anybody 
sign up to suggest a project and mentor it. It's probably worth talking to 
people in other projects that have done the gsoc thing before. 
And no, I'm not going to do that "mentor organization" application thing 
either, but there's bound to be *somebody* who wants to do it. Maybe it 
could even be done as part of the Linux-foundation drive (currently LSB 
and OpenPrinting, no kernel projects). See
	
https://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Google_Summer_of_Code
and maybe we can add a kernel thing to there.
