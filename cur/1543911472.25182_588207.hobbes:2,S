I can't see and subsystem ID. Since it is not on the few range of boards
where we know other ways for detecting the board internals, there's no
known way for auto-detecting your board.
The solution for you is to add:
	options bttv card=65
into /etc/modprobe.conf (or /etc/modules.conf, or /etc/modules -
depending on your distro).
This way, every time the driver is loaded, the card=65 option will
automatically be used by the bttv driver.
