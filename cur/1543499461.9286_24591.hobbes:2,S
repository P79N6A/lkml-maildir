Wrong. Gnu tar has no separate option for bzip2, although patches float
around (and they use at least three or four different letters, -y, -I
etc.) Here's what the maintainer says in the FAQ:
From:   François Pinard <pinard@IRO.UMontreal.CA>
. + Q: Why isn't there some `--bzip2' option to `tar'?
    I'm trying to not implement new options to `tar', when the functionality
    is easily obtainable by other means.  One may write `--use=bzip2' to
    get an effect similar to various suggested `--bzip2' options.  This is
    longer to write than a short option letter, but single letter options
    are a scarce resource, which I treat as such.  Not all hope is lost,
    however.  Jean-loup Gailly writes that he is working with the author
    of `bzip2' to integrate a slightly improved version of `bzip2' inside
    `zlib.'  As `paxutils' will eventually use `zlib', this should give
    us `bzip2' support rather transparently, right over the `z' option.
    Also, `z' will become optional on extraction, as `tar' will be made
    to automatically recognise when an archive is compressed.  So, we are
    going into the proper direction, although progress is admittedly slow.
