I don't think it is doing U100 :
]# hdparm -Tt /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.27 seconds =474.07 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.54 seconds = 25.20 MB/sec
]# hdparm -Tt /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.27 seconds =474.07 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.58 seconds = 24.81 MB/sec
]# hdparm -Tt /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.27 seconds =474.07 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.37 seconds = 46.72 MB/sec
(hde= promise U100)
]# hdparm -X69 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 setting xfermode to 69 (UltraDMA mode5)
dmesg gives me :
ide0: Speed warnings UDMA 3/4/5 is not functional.
