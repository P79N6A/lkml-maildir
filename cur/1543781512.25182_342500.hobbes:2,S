Hi,
I just tried upgrading udev 053 to 067 on a 2.6.12 system and although the 
system booted, firmware_class failed to upload the firmware for my wireless 
card, prism54 was no longer auto loaded, etc. Even manually loading the 
driver didn't help.
Any reason why 067 wouldn't work with 2.6.12? Do you have to do something 
special with hotplug prior to upgrading?
