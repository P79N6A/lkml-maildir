I agree it is sane. The problem is that it does not exist for long enough.
When you have 2.6.14.X working perfectly and you need a fix for a newly
discovered security fix which only exists in 2.6.15.Y, then you have to
leave 2.6.14 and enter 2.6.15. That is the problem, because for just a
fix, you change megabytes of source code which will bring their equivalent
in bugs.
