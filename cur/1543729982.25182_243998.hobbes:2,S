Unless I boot with hpet=disabled, the kernel gets to...
Using hpet for high-res timesource
Calibrating delay loop...
And sits here for a few minutes, then oopses (jpg attached). This is
100% reproducible.
This is a Tyan K8W dual Opteron m/b running a vanilla 2.6.8.1 kernel
compiled 32bit for K8 with smp and preempt. HPET is enabled in the
(latest) BIOS
Anything else I can supply, let me know.
