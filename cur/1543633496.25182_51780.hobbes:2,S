The net.ipv4.icmp_default_ttl patch
reminds me, about wierd stuff I've
seen in the net sysctls:
/proc/sys/net/unix/max_dgram_qlen is only
readable by root. Why?
Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt
refers to tcp_keepalive_interval when it should
refer to tcp_keepalive_intvl
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/../{arp_filter,tag}
are not documented.
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_rate_limit is jiffies.
Shouldn't this be HZ, i.e. jiffies shouldn't
be exported to userspace as it's non portable?
Any comments before I do a patch?
Padraig.
