I was considering doing this last night.
OTOH if I do that, I should merge the -git(\d+) in the same category
too.

Right now I simply moved them from unknown to the mainline branch, but I
still leave them separated like the -git(\d+) tags.
I probably should change that and merge after removing hte -g and -git
tags (of course without discarding the tag but showing it after clicking
on the kernel release).
Thanks.
