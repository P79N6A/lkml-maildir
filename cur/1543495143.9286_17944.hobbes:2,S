Subject: ide drive w/dma enabled causing system crash

Hope this isn't a waste of bandwith!:
Preface:  I recently purchased a new 17.2 gig udma drive (yech, I hate
ide) and experienced the following problem - I do not know if this is a
kernel issue with the ide driver code, but if this is a known problem or
an easy fix I apologize for your time.
Description:  The problem is a complete system halt (no oops, no magic
sysrq key, not even numlock works on the keyboard) during sustained writes
to the new dma-enabled drive.  I was transfering (via cp -a /mnt/local
/usr/) the contents of my old /usr/local partition (about a gig of data)
and the system froze (as described above).  I don't know what's causing
the problem - I can't read code like y'all do :) but I "fixed" the problem
by disabling dma for the new drive (hdparm -d0 /dev/hdb).  It may only
mask the problem by slowing down transfer rates (hdparm -t /dev/hdb
dropped from ~11 MB/sec to ~4.5 MB/sec).
My Guess:  One thing I suspect but don't know for is that hdparm -i lists
the new drive w/ a BuffSize=512kB, and if that means the onboard cache
physically on the drive I believe that may be wrong - this drive is out of
a 100-pack that I was told were 256kB cache drives (diamondmax 17.2 GB
drives come in two cache sizes).  I suppose I could look on the drive it
may say, but I finally closed up my case for the first time in months.  So
perhaps the false cache size is causing cache misses...but I'm talking out
of my ass here :)  Is there anyway I can resize that param to
"BuffSize=256kB"?
Sytem Info:
	Kernel version is currently 2.2.7-ac3, I've tried it on 2.2.6ac1,
vanilla 2.2.7, and 2.2.7-ac3 with repeatable crashes each time.  I haven't
tried it on 2.0.36 but since 2.1.113 started enabling DMA I don't know if
it will show up, etc. or if 2.0.36 can use DMA for ide drives.
	my .config for 2.2.7-ac3 is attached along with the output of
dmesg.
	I have four ide devices.  /dev/hda and /dev/hdc use dma, they're
older 1-gig drives.  /dev/hdd is a cdrom, and /dev/hdb is the new 17.2 gig
drive.  /dev/hdb has 2 partitions - a 2 gig I was writing to, and the rest
(about 15 gig) in another partition.  Only ext2 and swap, no windows.
Linux only :)
	System is an AMD K6-333 (hell no wrt overclocking) on a tyan 1590s
trinity 100AT motherboard using the MVP3 chipset, 64 MB ram, usually with
an uptime of 15-20 days before I put in a new kernel, etc.  Very stable,
never had an oops - random reboots until I smeared on some CPU grease for
heat transfer and I never saw them again.  Bought the board and chip a few
months ago, new bios, etc.
	I will also try the revamped ide driver stuff
(pre-patch-2.2.8-series candidate) from Andre M. Hedrick, but I don't have
time until tomorrow.  This is "DGD" situation - as in I don't give a damn
and will try any stuff y'all throw at me.
