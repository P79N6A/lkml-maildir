I have seen this sort of macro style before in the kernel where () just makes 
it clear that it is a function but a real static inline is ok with me.

Makes sense but it is only used in the CONFIG_SWAP_PREFETCH case so it would 
end up as a static inline in swap.h to avoid ending being #ifdefed in 
page_alloc.c. Do you think that's preferable to having it in 
swap_prefetch.c ?

Good idea.
Thanks!
