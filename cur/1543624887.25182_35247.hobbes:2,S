> What about doing soft TLB reloads then?
ppc32 linux preloads entries into the hashed pagetable in
update_mmu_cache. Im about to commit a patch to do the same thing
in ppc64, at the moment we take two exceptions per pagefault which
is pretty ugly.
Some ppc32 hardware does allow you to take an exception for a TLB miss
(ie bypass the hashed pagetable completely).
