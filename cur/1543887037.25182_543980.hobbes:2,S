Yes.
Unswappable kernel memory is simpler and faster.
Over the last 15 years, the memory requirements of the
Linux kernel have grown maybe a factor 10, while the
memory of computers has grown by a factor of 1000.
The data structures that grow with memory (mostly the
mem_map[] array of page structs) has actually gotten
smaller since the 2.4 kernel and now takes under 1%
of memory even on x86-64.
There really is no good reason for swapping kernel
memory nowadays.
