Actually, growisofs refuses to work with anything but a block device-- so it's 
using /dev/sr1. So apparently something else is up, since ide-cd errors, yet 
ide-scsi does not.
Apparently, ide-scsi isn't working either though, just a different problem: 
the burning *appears* to work (I get status info, and the drive seems to do 
something), but the disc ends up unburned and empty. Has anyone successfully 
burned a dual layer disc? I'm using a BenQ DW1620 drive.
