I would have thought it was fairly obvious.  PAGG supplies the task 
aggregation mechanism, these patches provide per task caps and all 
that's needed is the code that marries the two.

It could do that by manipulating nice which is already available in the 
kernel.
I.e. these patches plus improved statistics (which are coming, I hope) 
together with the existing policy controls provide all that is necessary 
to do comprehensive CPU resource control.  If there is an efficient way 
to get the statistics out to user space (also coming, I hope) this 
control could be exercised from user space.
