I think Jeff might be looking for a function such as:
interruptable_sleep_on_irq(n):
	-- allocate unused irq(n), bind in generic_irqhandler(n)
	-- save PID in wakeuptable(n)
	-- unmask irq(n)
	-- sleep until woken up by generic_irqhandler(n)
	-- deallocate irq(n)
	-- exit
generic_irqhandler(n):
	-- permanently mask irq(n)
	-- wakeup(wakeuptable(n))
	-- exit
Those two functions could then be made available to user-level
either through /proc or a newsyscall, thereby permitting *user-level*
interrupt handling ("virtual device drivers" from userland).
Wow!
