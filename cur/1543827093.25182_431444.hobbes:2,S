If this is true, then it's only because the Ubuntu developers do not
want to support older kernel versions.  Other distros handle this just
fine (Gentoo and Debian for example).  This is not a kernel issue, but
rather a distro design issue.
Which is much different from the fact that I take a "ext3" partition
from my new distro and can't get to the data if I downgrade to an older
distro for whatever reason (or use an older rescue disk.)
Don't confuse distro design decisions from issues forced on an unknowing
user by the ext3 fs kernel developers.
thanks,
