No. Look closer:
  04:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV370 5B60 [Radeon X300 (PCIE)] (prog-if 00 [VGA])
	Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Extreme AX300SE-X
That's the 5b60 chip too (yeah, the lspci doesn't show numbers when it has 
an ascii string, but in this case the ascii string happily has at least 
that part of the number in it: ".. RV370 5B60 ..", where the 5B60 is just 
the PCI ID number).
So it _is_ the same chip.
I just worry whether (a) the other added PCI ID's are any good for that 
core and (b) whether the bug was really introduced with some of the other 
changes. I admit that (b) is pretty unlikely, but it would be good to 
test.

Sadly, that module loading is done by X. So the bootup dmesg stuff 
wouldn't have had the message.
It might be interesting to see if the hang can be reproduced without 
starting X at all, by just going a "modprobe radeon" or something. 
Unlikely, though - while loading the drm modules does _some_ things to the 
card, it's usually only when X actually starts sending commands to them 
that things really go downhill..
