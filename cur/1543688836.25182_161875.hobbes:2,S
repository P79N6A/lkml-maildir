Then you have a bug in the Sparc code.  It looks like it should return
-EINVAL when a misaligned mapping is used with MAP_FIXED|MAP_SHARED,
but the test program is clearly getting mappings that aren't aligned
to SHMLBA.

I understand that userspace needs to keep it coherent, or map to a
multiple of SHMLBA.  I don't mind whether the kernel constrains the
mapping address or not, with a slight preference for userspace
flexibility.
Thus I have three Sparc-specific questions:
	1. How does userspace find out the value of SHMLBA?
	   On Sparc, it is not a compile-time constant.
	2. Is flushing part of the data cache something I can do from
	   userspace?  (I'll figure out the exact machine instructions
	   myself if I need to do this, but it'd be nice to know if
	   it's possible before I have a go).
	3. Is there a kernel bug on Sparc, because the test program
	   is either getting mappings that aren't aligned to run time
	   SHMLBA, or the kernel's run time SHMLBA value is not correct.
Thanks,
