2 errors are expected (long-standing breakages).
14 failures are due to your ancient gcc 4.0.2 not supporting -mabi=aapcs-linux:
/scratch/sfr/next/scripts/mod/empty.c:1: error: invalid ABI option: -mabi=aapcs-linux
Another one is an internal error in your ancient compiler:
/scratch/sfr/next/arch/arm/common/it8152.c:148: internal compiler error: in trunc_int_for_mode, at explow.c:53
Can you build a cross compiler using gcc 4.2.3 from ftp.gnu.org instead?
That one serves me perfectly for my cross-compile tests.
