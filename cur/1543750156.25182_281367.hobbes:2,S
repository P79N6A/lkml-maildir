It's safe for the compat ioctl case. If someone wants to use the
same function for the compat and native handler, it would be a bug
to return -ENOIOCTLCMD from that handler with the current code.
To work around this, we could either convert -ENOIOCTLCMD to -EINVAL
when returning from sys_ioctl(). Or we could WARN_ON(err == -ENOIOCTLCMD)
for the native path in order to make the intention clear.
