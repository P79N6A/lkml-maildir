Most of them are the biggest possible writes.
~/compile/ercftp ./sender localhost ../nfs-kaboom.c
Using 2048 byte packets
Connecting to localhost
Resolved, opening TCP socket
Doing connect
Connected, waiting for OK...
Waiting for OK...
Sending ../nfs-kaboom.c

~/compile/ercftp ./receiver 
Getting TCP socket

Writing 23987 to ../nfs-kaboom.c
... another while
caught signal 14! flen=23987, inlen=0, pos=0, packets=12, packet.seqno=0
