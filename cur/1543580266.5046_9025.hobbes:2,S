At the moment there is no way to reclaim the swap space if
the page is shared, and for non-shared pages we haven't
implemented a way to reclaim swap space.
While reclaiming swap space when you run out is pretty
trivial to do, Linus doesn't seem to like the idea all
that much and Disk Space Is Cheap(tm) so it's not very
high on my list of things to do.

If you're swapping heavily, yes. If most of your programs
fit in memory and you're hardly using swap, nothing changes.
