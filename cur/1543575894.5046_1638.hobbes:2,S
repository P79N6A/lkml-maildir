	Any idea if these issues would cause a general slow-down of a
machine?  For no apparent reason after 5 days running 2.4.0test12
everything going through my firewall (set up using iptables) I got about
100ms time added on to pings and traceroutes.  I'll probably reboot the
machine tonight and see if that helps.
