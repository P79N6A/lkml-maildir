12 was from the original draft5 version, and my change was to remove it.
Saying it can scale up to 64 processors is key (remember, we need people
to realize that this is competitor to NT Server, since NT Workstation
is limited to 2 processors).  I'm not familiar enough with the SMP
support to know if the kernel is what scales worse than the hardware
at a certain point (12 procs it would seem), but the original phrasing
seemed to imply that we had up to 12 working and up to 64 kind-of working.
Any kernel is going to have scaling issues getting up to 64 procs, I
just want to make sure this press release is as positive as possible.
Mentioning good performance on 12 processor systems clearly implies, at
least to me, a minimum of severe scaling problems after that, and worst
case worse performance on 13+ processor systems than 12.  If that is in
fact the case, I guess it's worth keeping around, but unless scaling the
kernel itself happens to have a huge knee in the curve around 12 procs
(totally unrelated to the underlying hardware) then I just didn't see
the point.
