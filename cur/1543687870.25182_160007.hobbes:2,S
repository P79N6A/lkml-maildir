Hi Larry,
The disrespect wasn't directed towards you, but at the problem. BKcvs
is a great resource, but it's got some recurring bugs, and they're
quite frustrating. While I realize you're the author, everyone makes
mistakes. Your work on the CVS gateway is appreciated, even though it
isn't flawless yet.
