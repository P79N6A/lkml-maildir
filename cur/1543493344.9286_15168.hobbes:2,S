Note, the timezones are the same.  
The guy who sent this is my coworker, and I was watching for the email on the
list.  He told me when he sent it.  It didn't arrive until 10 hours later.  I
highly doubt this is optimal.
I wonder what kind of hardware this list is run on.  Is it a 386-class(yes, I
know it is a sparc of some kind)?  lists.debian.org does a HUGE amount of
traffic, and there is never more than a minute of turn-arounnd.  It is a
p133/64m, with ide disks.
Adam (how can we keep our record of low-digit hours in fixing bugs if the list
software has such slow turn-around?)
