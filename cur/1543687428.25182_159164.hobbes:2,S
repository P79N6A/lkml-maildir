It's come up before, so it's not necessarily an original, annoying 
question ;-)
My non-lawyer guess would be, the structures and defines are required 
for Linux interoperability; that may be a factor.  static inline 
functions in headers, i.e. real code, is another matter too.
One way or another (direct inclusion, or via glibc-kernheaders pkg) the 
headers today are GPL'd not LGPL'd... so I suppose it remains the realm 
of lawyers...
IANAL,
