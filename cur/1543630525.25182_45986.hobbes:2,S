Absolutely - and it should, since that IS the primary audit log daemon.
I don't consider that a "bug". Only if a "user" process (non-root, or
non-designated user) can exceed the set bounds, by either appending, or
filling in a hole, should there be a bug in the system.
Personally, I think ext2 works great. (And I DON'T count the time experimental
code with the warning "caution, may be hazardous to your filesystem" as
causing problems - I had expected it to.)
I've never had a problem with ext2, even when I did fill the filesystem.
I was able to log in and view the audit log, and clean up without
problems - exactly as I would expect.
It has been the most stable file system I've ever used (and I've used
quite a few - old Files-11 and Files-32, RT11, dos, UFS, UNICOS nc1, SGI
efs and xfs ...)
Easier fsck procedure than all of them. Fixed any inconsistancies as well
and didn't loose any resident files.
I've only lost one ext2fs - and that was due to a head crash. The drive
had been running for a couple of years continuously, with only a few
mis-guided reboots.
