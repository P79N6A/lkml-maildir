Badblocks error reading beyond the end of the partition is irrelevant,
it is a primitive bug somewhere unrelated to media condition.
Also Badblocks without disabling drive cache is _utterly_useless_.
It will not be a bare swsusp bug, I would have hit that in 20K+ cycles
since using LZF and a thousand or so  of other 2.4 users would have
hit it too.
Please help indentify the actual problem  by running some decent  tests.
