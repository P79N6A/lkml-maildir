Subject: [PATCH] Fix %x parsing in vsscanf()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/23/193

The existing code in kernel/vsprintf.c:vsscanf() does not properly 
handle the case where the format is specfied as %x or %X and the
string contains the number in the format "0xinteger". Instead of
reading "0xinteger", the code currently only sees the '0' and treats
the 'x' as a delimiter. Following patch (against 2.4 and 2.6) fixes
this.  Another option is to put the check in simple_strtoul() and
simple_strtoull() if that is preferred. I like this better b/c
we only have the check once.
Please apply,
