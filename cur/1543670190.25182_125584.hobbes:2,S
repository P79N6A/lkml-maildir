Yep. I thought of that too, which is why I had also written:

I think it's the use of "--force" option to RPM that causes this,
or else, faulty RPMs.  It's not so easy to make a well-behaved
RPM.  Having tried myself, sometimes I think maybe RPM 
really stands for "Revolting Pile of Manure". (no offense ;-) Of 
course I'm probably trying to bend it do a job for which perhaps 
it is not so well suited.
