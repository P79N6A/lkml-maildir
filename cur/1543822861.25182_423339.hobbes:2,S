If you did, I don't think it ever got into the kernel.
It was added by Kay Sievers on Nov 3, 2004, according to the old history 
(back then it was in drivers/block/genhd.c, and the function was called 
"block_hotplug()", but apart from renaming the function and moving the 
file, it's recognizably the same.
Of course, you may have killed off an even earlier incarnation..
