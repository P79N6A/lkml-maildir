	Well that's my point. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, it's
because you suspect that something is wrong with your system's security. Of
course, we don't go testing how scratch-resistant our glasses are by
attempting to scratch them. In principle, however, it should be safe from an
OS standpoint assuming your system has been configured to be secure.
