Actually, though he may be using a spinlock_t, when used this way, it
is not a spinlock, but rather a semaphore-like construct like PG_locked.
Spinlocks include blocking via busywait semantics, which this usage
does not have. It just happens to use the same data type. There are
other interesting abuses of spinlock-like constructs in "advanced"
locks, for instance, in non-sleeping handoff-scheduled queueing locks
(e.g. MCS spinlocks and rwlocks) it's a common idiom for one waiter to
set a "blocked" bit or lock word and then spin on it until another
waiter and/or cpu manipulating the lock clears it.
