It's using it to send a dummy packet to the patch function.
It is gross, but it does work because it allocated it's own
private data area to skb->nh.iph.
Just leave it alone for now, ipt_recent is gross and full of many
errors and bug, and thus stands to have a rewrite. Patrick McHardy
said he will try to do that.
