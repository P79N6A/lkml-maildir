Subject to availability. No contract implied or etc.. Its something to
tackle after the rest of initramfs works. Even if not then the lsmod case
can be made to work since its just a matter of putting the names in a segment
for the linker to collate.
We already have module_init/module_exit which is a big chunk of the cleanup.
