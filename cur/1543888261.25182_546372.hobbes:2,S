Yes, it is.  What removes all arch-except-i386-and-x86_64 from your
kernel tree?  Can't it also do
$ sed @source "arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig"@#source "arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig"@
at the same time?
Who supports a pared-down kernel tree like this?

Sorry, I didn't quite understand that part.

drivers/crypto/ currently contains drivers for x86_32 and s390
(the latter by indirection, which is what is causing you this
grief/problem/whatever), but it certainly looks like it could
be a home for crypto drivers on any arch.

I'm not aware of that.  E.g., i386 and x86_64 share a lot of code
via "#include ../foo/bar" (and it's bad/ugly).

That would be the best solution IMO, if it only worked.  :(
E.g.:
if S390
source "arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig"
endif
in drivers/crypto/Kconfig.  Alas, it doesn't work.
