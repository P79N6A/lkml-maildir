   Nasty idea, since its ideologically unclean.
   The idea behind the CONFIG_xxx options is to give user the control over
 the kernel content in the cases he really can win from it.
   I suppose no sane user knows what crc32 is needed by, nor even whats it..   
   Nor he should, since maximum of his knowledge lies in device selection,
 which is the proper source for such information.
   What i`m trying to say is that CONFIG_xxx is just the wrong information
 bearer for that.
