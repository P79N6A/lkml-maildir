Hi,
This probably isn't much use as I can't reproduce it and didn't really get
enough debugging information, but it might just ring a bell with somebody..
I tried to 'su' and it hung; the EIP was in the vicinity of the symbols from
the unix.o module, but seemed to be a little before any of them so I don't
know exactly what it was waiting on. Interestingly, the 'tail -f' that I leave
running on my syslog outputted files also didn't seem to want to be interrupted
or suspended.
I suspect a problem with the unix domain stuff (particularly, the fact that
I have it as a module) -- su likes to write to syslog. It looks very similar
to the problems I had on boot up when I first tried to get modular unix domain
stuff working early in 2.2.x, which were resolved by compiling with the right
version of genksyms. Today's problem happened suddenly in the middle of a
session tho', so I'm less inclined to blame user brain-damage than usual :)
