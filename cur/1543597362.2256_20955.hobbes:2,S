    Atomic commit.  The superblock, which references the updated

Yes... and which ever part of the superblock contains the sequence
number must be written atomically.
The point is, you _NEED_ to be sure that data written before the
superblock (or indeed anywhere further up the tree, you can make
changes in theory which don't require super-block updates) are written
firmly to the platters before any thing which refers to it is updated.
Alan was saying with IDE you cannot reliably do this, I assume you can
with SCSI was my point.
