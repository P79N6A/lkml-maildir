Okay, lovely, thanks.
Takashi: I'll be converting ALSA ISA drivers over to this now. What I'd 
in fact would like to do is do that one driver at a time. I have a 
metric buttload of these old ISA soundcards and believe it would be a 
nice opportunity to actually test these old drivers (and possibly do 
some cleanups) as I go along. Would you mind that?
If you'd rather the isa_bus thing was one discrete change, that's also 
okay though. I'd then just do that as a somewhat mechanical change and 
then revisit those drivers at some later time for additional testing 
and/or cleanup.
In either case, I'll ofcourse not submit anything untill this thing has 
made -mm.
Rene.
