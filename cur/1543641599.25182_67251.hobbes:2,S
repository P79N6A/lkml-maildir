On my Thinkpad R32, the timings vary:
real:  anything between 15ms and 40ms
user:  mostly 0ms, sometimes 10ms
sys:   mostly 20ms, sometimes 30ms
To get average values, I did this:
blackmagic:~> time for i in `seq 1 600`; do cat /proc/apm >/dev/null; done
real    0m14.775s
user    0m0.700s
sys     0m12.650s
However, these values are rather bogus; I also measured the time with
my digital wristwatch. Result: 60.60s
                               ======
To measure the overhead of the shell command itself, I did this:
blackmagic:~> cat /proc/apm >/tmp/apm 
blackmagic:~> time for i in `seq 1 600`; do cat /tmp/apm >/dev/null; done
real    0m1.769s
user    0m0.900s
sys     0m0.690s
For the sake of simplicity, this overhead can be neglected. So:
reading /proc/apm 600 times roughly takes 60 real seconds, which
means that reading it once takes about 100ms. This is huge, isn't it?
BTW, I tried this both with apm_allow_ints enabled and disabled.
Didn't make much difference. (And my Thinkpad didn't hang after
the BIOS calls with apm_allow_ints disabled, so maybe IBM has fixed
a bug? By introducing another one ;-)
I think I haven't mentioned yet that I'm using a vanilla 2.4.19 kernel.

Interesting. Where can I get `tppow'? Would it even be safe to use it
on a different Thinkpad?
Thanks,
Frank
