If the PNP BIOS panic is new (ie it didn't happen in 2.5.24), can you
write down the whole panic (and look up the symbols) and send that one to
Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>?
That would most likely be due to some of the GDT reorganizations that
happened for 2.5.30 due to the thread-local-storage patches.
