Then you should be fine with the copying data and memset stuff, based on
the workload the rest of the kernel does for other busses which have
this same requirement of DMAable buffers.
And I'm sure David will be glad to have you point out any places in his
code where it accidentally takes data off of the stack instead of
allocating it.
