pure bzImages is what many kernel developers use to boot static kernel 
images, with drivers built in, often with no module support, etc.:
 $ make help | grep -i bzImage
 * bzImage      - Compressed kernel image (arch/x86/boot/bzImage)
the bzImage method never led to a panic related to a ramdisk before 
(unless the ramdisk was materially corrupted - which is not the case 
here), and should not lead to a panic afterwards either.
We use panics/crashes when the kernel meets a problem that makes 
continuing impossible, but that is not an issue here.
