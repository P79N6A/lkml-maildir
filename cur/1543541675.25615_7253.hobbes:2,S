What about to use:
dir/file
dir/#file/Icon
dir/#file/Info
but leaving the exact semantics Linus proposed for S_ISCOMPLEX solution?
The only needed additions I think are the rules:
- creating dir/#file implies the creation of an empty dir/file (if it
does not exists)
- no regular files can be created with names beginning with # (or
another magic char, BTW a suffix instead of a prefix would keep sorting
happy)
In this way we can use NFS mounting, tar, cpio, and all current stuff
without changes.
