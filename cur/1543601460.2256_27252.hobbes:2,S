Ummmm.. because the 2.4 series is supposed to be the stable series.. and
a lot of people's comments on virtually every 2.4 kernel have expressed
dissatisfaction with it's stability..
So a lot of people haven't left the 2.2 series yet, and are waiting for
a 2.4 series that everyone is happy with..  Even in your note, you
haven't indicated a release 2.4 version that makes you happy.
