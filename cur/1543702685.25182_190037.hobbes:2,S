Not change - keep (from 2.4). You see, the problem might be - somebody
updates the NFS-server from 2.4 to 2.6 and then suddenly some clients fail
to work with it. Seems a non-obvious fact, that after upgrading the server
clients' configuration might have to be changed. At the very least this
must be documented in Kconfig.
Thanks
