Subject: [patch 02/10] uml: force using /bin/bash for building
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/11/319

This forces make to use bash rather than whatever /bin/sh is linked to.
Without this, since there are some bash extensions used in the build and when
/bin/sh isn't bash, then the build fails without a clear error message.
