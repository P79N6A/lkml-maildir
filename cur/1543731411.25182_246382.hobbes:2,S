First let me apologize to the list.  I get carried away now and then :)
Actually I was refering to the fact that these algorithms are not 
"decompression" in any way shape or form.  These cameras don't capture 
640x480 images, compress them in hardware, transfer the data over a USB 
cable for the driver to then "decompress".  They capture at some lower 
resolution (160x120 has been claimed) and the driver simply interpolates 
the data to produce the claimed resolution.  There is nothing "true" 
about the 640x480 resolution at all.
So yeah, Logitech is making false claims to their customers and seeing 
as they get their chips from Philips I'm thinking they are responsible.
