Hello all!
I don't want to start another geometry war, but with the introduction of
the general getgeo function by Christoph Hellwig for all disks this
simply would become a matter of extending the basic gendisk block driver.
There are people out there (like me) who need to know about disk
geometry. But since this is clearly post 2.6.16 I prefer to ask here
before writing a patch...
Q1: Yes or No?
If no, the other questions do not apply
Q2: Where under sysfs?
Either do /sys/block/hdx/heads, /sys/block/hdx/sectors, etc. or should
there be a new sub-object like /sys/block/hdx/geometry/heads?
Q3: Writable?
Under some (weird) circumstances it would actually be quite nice to
overwrite the kernels idea of a disks geometry. This would require a
general function like setgeo. Acceptable?
Regards
Philippe Seewer
