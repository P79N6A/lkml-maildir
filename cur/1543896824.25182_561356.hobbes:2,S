CONFIG_SCSI _does_ have code associated with it.
(so does CONFIG_RAID_ATTRS)
[ I was expecting you to give the counter-example of various
config symbols that control the assignment of some value to
some variable, actually, but then I would've countered back
with the fact that a variable is also "code" and not something
that is only about presentation / user interface :-) ]

Yup, so how / why am I wrong? I was making the point that a
"menuconfig" does not have code associated with it. Why else
_was_ it invented then, if not only for presentation / user interface
purposes? I really don't see what role it plays as a "config symbol"
in Kconfig (other than the fact that that is how it got implemented
to do its thing).
