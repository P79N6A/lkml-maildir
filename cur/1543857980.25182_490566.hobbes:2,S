This is (presumably) not just "strings" on the binary -- it's actually 
using the documented way to statically extract a version number string 
from a Linux kernel binary, even a compressed one.  A lot of things, 
including Grub, depends on it.  If they're doing something other than 
that, of course, then they deserve what they get.
Now, their problem is that they're making assumptions that are probably 
unwarranted about the contents of that string.
