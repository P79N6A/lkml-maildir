I'd say that energy usage is the same _per unit of work_. But if you
compare a box that is sitting idle 90% of the time at 0% throttling
vs. a box that is sitting idle 80% of the time with 50% throttling and
neither of these boxes support C2 you'll find that the second box uses
less energy overall.
