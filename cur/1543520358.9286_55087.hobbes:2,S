about khttpd and embedded stuff:
How hard is 
1.  get proc interface exported on khttpd
	like that ctl_table would have 
		struct khttpd_export_properties * httpd_export
	and if http_export != NULL then khttpd looks into there and 
	does GET (and PUT ?)
	and proc users can alloc single copy of http_export_properties
	(not repetitevly for each like current proc system)
2. Authentication, at least some basic.
i.e. to get a (network related) system where only kernel is running.
(contrary to the system where I have to fit a shitload of stuff on
floppy in order to get to log into a remote linux bridge and get
configuring it)
