You cannot get the kernel to run from a different physical address by changing
PAGE_OFFSET.  This is not what PAGE_OFFSET is for.  PAGE_OFFSET specifies the
offset of virtual memory from the start of physical memory, which is assumed to
be 0x0.
You should never want to change PAGE_OFFSET.

Wrong.
If you really do want the kernel to run at 0x200000 physical, you should
try changing the link address to 0xc0200000.  I'm no expert on the
i386 kernel (I know the PPC kernel), but there's no guarantee that this
will work, if there's any code which assumes the kernel is at 0x100000
physical.
