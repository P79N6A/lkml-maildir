Hi guys,
this is my last version of schedule() and semaphore implementation where
I've fixed WAITQUEUE_DEBUG issues in __sem_wake_up(), delete
TASK_EXCLUSIVE handling in __sem_wake_up() that is not used anymore
and ( THX to Andrea Arcangeli ) process looping in the last goodness slot
( where live RT processes ).
About linux list implementation of my slots queues I continue to prefer my
version
for speed reasons ( although the linux lists are more clear ).
In fact at every cycle You must obtain a task_struct pointer through the
macro
list_entry() while is my version one time You get the first pointer through
TGDS_HEAD() You can walk with task->__next.
Cheers,
        Davide.
