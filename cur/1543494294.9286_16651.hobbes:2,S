Otto,
	Can you do latency tests with lmbench to compare the results between
FreeBSD and Linux on the same machine?  I have seen big differences in 
memory latency between Tru64 and Alpha/Linux on identical Alpha hardware.
I think that it might be a combination of cache-sloshing and lack of page 
coloring, but I haven't had time to track it down more.  
This might be what FreeBSD does better than Linux, and you are seeing the
results with the HINT benchmark.
