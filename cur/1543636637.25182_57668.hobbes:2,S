Nope, I still disagree and there is no point going back and forth.
We both agree that there are situations where both resource accounting
(or some sort of root-protection like you want) and strict overcommit is
required.
I contend there are situations where only one or the other is needed.
More importantly, I argue the two things should be kept separate. 
Putting some root safety net into strict accounting is a hack (how much
of a net? etc.).  You want to keep users from ruining things - get
per-user resource limits.  You want to keep the machine from
overcommiting memory and thus not OOMing?  Get strict accounting.  You
want both?  Use both.
I provided the first piece.
