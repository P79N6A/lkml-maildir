   Aha, making a list and just patching early at boot is even simpler
   than method I was thinking about.... Why not do it that way?
Even more cleverly you could use subsections, and thus:
1) __init free the patch code blocks at the end of boot
2) patch them more simply, the .subsection entries would
   be "kern_addr, insn" __u32 pairs on x86 for example.
