Hmm... what MAC address? This one certainly doesn't work, I'm not
sure what makes it different:
eth0: 3Com 3c905 Boomerang 100baseTx at 0xff00, 00:60:08:15:9b:dc,IRQ 11
  8K word-wide RAM 3:5 Rx:Tx split, autoselect/NWay Autonegotiation interface.
  MII transceiver found at address 24, status 7869.
  Enabling bus-master transmits and whole-frame receives.
