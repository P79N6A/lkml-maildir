The problems were present before I ran reiserfsck. I never ran
--rebuild-tree

I think this is a problem with the reiserfs code in the kernel. I never
ran reiserfsck before this problem surfaced. The problem arose in the
netscape cache directory with lots of small files. Guess the tail handling
is not that stable yet?
