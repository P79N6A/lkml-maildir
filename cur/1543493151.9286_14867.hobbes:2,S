In my setup, changing the initial value of these more than doubles 
performance (with the same number of clients).

There must be _something_ I'm missing. A typical procinfo shows:

Looks like the CPU is mostly idle, there is memory to spare (and no swapping),
and most of the files are being served from cache - hence the low disk read
numbers (although the disk is a pretty fast seagate cheetah). Logging is off.
The network is pretty clean - no retransmissions. Yet the specweb throughput
is below offered load.
I haven't had much time to investigate this yet...

That was my first option - but the version I'm running is  disappointing,
and the binary doesn't give many options to tune.
Anyone know of a webserver that uses sendfile() on linux?
thanks.
