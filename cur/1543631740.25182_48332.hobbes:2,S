Problem is that CPU selection is not based on cpu itself, but in options
offered by previous gcc compilers.
I think that the menu should contain separate config options for each
processor type, so it is easily modifiable for specific optimizations
offered by new compilers (for example, gcc-3.1 splitting i686 in
pentium-pro, p2, p3 and p4), or some braindead hacker can optimize
code snippets for some kind of processor.
