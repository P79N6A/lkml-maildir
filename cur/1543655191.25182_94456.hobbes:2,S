	How about renaming DMA_INCONSISTENT to DMA_MAYBE_CONSISTENT?
	By the way, I previously suggested a flags field to indicate
what the driver could cope with.  0 would mean consistent memory, 1's
would indicate other things that the driver could cope with that would
be added if and when a real need for them arises (read caching, write
back cachine, cpu-cpu consistency, cache line size smaller than 2**n
bytes, etc.).  Regarding the debugging capability of
DMA_CONFORMANCE_NONE, I don't think that will be as useful in the way
that DMA_DIRECTION_NONE is, because transfer direction is often passed
through the io path of a device driver and errors in doing so are a
common.  In comparison, I think the calls to dma_malloc will typically
have this argument specified as a constant where the call is made,
with the possible exception of some allocation being consolidated in
the generic device layer.
