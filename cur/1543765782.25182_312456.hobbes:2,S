Hi Christoph,
If you remember you complained about ntfs' "fishy use of iput"?
I think that David's explanation below is exactly the reason why I had
to do it IIRC...  So if the vfs is fixed so the below can _never_ happen
anymore then I believe it would be safe to do as you and Al suggest and
stop using iput in a "fishy" way in ntfs...
Best regards,
	Anton
