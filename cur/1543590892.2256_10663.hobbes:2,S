The current LVM device (if compiled with DEBUG_MAP) will report all of
the logical->physical block mappings via printk.  Probably too heavy-
weight for a large amount of IO.  It could be changed to save the block
numbers into a cache, to be extracted later.  All of the LVM mapping
is done in the lvm_map() function.
Cheers, Andreas
