This breaks cancel_freezing(). Somehow we should clear TIF_SIGPENDING for
kernel threads. Otherwise we may have subtle failures if try_to_freeze_tasks()
fails.
Also, whith this change do_sigaction()->recalc_sigpending_and_wake() doesn't
make sense any longer, yes?

In theory, flush_signals(t) needs a similar change. However, it is always
called with t == current. Perhaps it makes sense to make it flush_signals(void) ?
Do you see any valid usage of flush_signals(t) when t != current ?
(Actually, imho the same is true for dequeue_signal(). Except for signalfd.c
 dequeue_signal() should operate on current. Perhaps it would be a bit cleaner
 to have dequeue_signal_tsk(tsk) and dequeue_signal(void), the latter does
 recalc_sigpending).
