You've been sleeping in class. We always try to get the fileid together
with the GETFH. The irritating bit is having to redo a GETATTR using the
old filehandle in order to figure out if the 2 filehandles refer to the
same file. Unlike filehandles, fileids can be reused.
Then there is the point of dealing with that servers can (and do!)
actually lie to you.
