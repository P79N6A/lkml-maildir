I had in fact just rebooted with these patches when I got your mail.
And they do indeed fix the problem, 2.6-bk + these two patches suspends
and resumes fine and the e1000 interface works again after resume. I
tested without these patches as well and then it's the same as before,
only a few interrupts get through once in a while.
Thanks everyone.
