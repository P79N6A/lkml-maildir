Yes that's correct as far as I know too. The VGDA and LVCB contain all the
information required for import even without an exportvg.

Yes, you can think of crfs (or chfs) as a composite command that handles
this (writing to LVCB. These are more like
administrative/setup/configuration commands -- one time, or occasional
system configuration changes.
On the other hand a mount doesn't cause a persistent configuration
information change. You can issue a mount even if an entry doesn't exist in
/etc/filesystems.

Is mount the right time to do this ? A mount happens on every boot of the
system.
And then, one can issue a mount by explicitly specifying all the parameters
without having an entry in fstab. [Doesn't that also mean that you have a
possibility of inconsistency even here ?]
