My 0.02$
	confirmed:
upgrade 2.2.13pre14 -> 2.2.13pre15 also gave:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference
...
hda: lost interrupt
hda: lost interrupt
etc ...
Running SMP with IDE harddisk
For some reason I don't find the klog back but it happened
just after running 2.2.13pre15 for the 1st time
(while compiling alsa modules)
PS: I admit I compile with gcc 2.95.1 (but then 2.2.13pre14 too and it was rock solid)
