  Your right, the compression/decompression will take away some CPU cycles. Also
  this may be a very bad idea for a single CPU box.

  It's a very crazy thought. May be it may not work at all. Looking from the
  perspective of large systems ( assuming there is lots of RAM ).
  a) If there is lots of swapping activity and when we swap the process out, the
     I/O can be reduced by compressing the pages and putting on the disk. But as
     you rightly pointed out this will eat into CPU cycles. All the same if we
     have a real efficient Algorithm for compression/decompression, might be worth
     a look. This can be a good-option if we are swapping out large data.
  b) Again very much a strange thought. If we have some support from hardware which
     take care of compressing/decompressing data which can then be swapped out.
  All this * might * be a viable option only on the basis of the cost involved in
  eating up CPU cycles vis-a-vis large I/O due to swapping.
  Would be great to hear the comments from others.
 thanks,
 Rama.
