Interesting.  I simplified smp_call_function_ma{sk,ny}, and introduced this bug (see 54b11e6d57a10aa9d0009efd93873e17bffd5d30).
We used to wait on OOM, yes, but we didn't do them one at a time.
We could restore that quiesce code, or call a function on all online cpus using on-stack data, and have them atomic_dec a counter when they're done (I'm not sure why we didn't do this in the first place: Nick?)

I don't see how the *ever* worked then, even with the quiesce stuff.

Doesn't this break with more than one cpus?  I think a refcnt is needed for the general case...
