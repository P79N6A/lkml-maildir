Yes but if you look at ide_start_dma() in ide-dma.c you will notice
that the if (!ar) path is taken, which will cause fallback from
DMA to PIO transfer:
/*
  * Start DMA engine.
  */
int ide_start_dma(struct ata_channel *hwif, ide_drive_t *drive, ide_dma_action_t 
func)
{
	unsigned int reading = 0, count;
	unsigned long dma_base = hwif->dma_base;
	struct ata_request *ar = IDE_CUR_AR(drive);
	/* This can happen with drivers abusing the special request field.
	 */
	if (!ar) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "DMA without ATA request\n");
		return 1;
	}
