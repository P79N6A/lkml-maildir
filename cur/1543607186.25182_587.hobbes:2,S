Now, as near as I can tell, he didn't make them available to you and put
up protections against your acquring information you should not have. It
does not matter if they're pissweak as rot13 or not...
As such any getting around them (either by lieing in answer to a

of his digital protection mechanisms and as such your actions would be
punishable under the DMCA, would they not?
