Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: fix some issues with mem_reserve

Hi,
I found a couple of issues with reserve_mem:
- If we try and mem_reserve something of zero length, everything
  reserved after it would get ignored. This is because early_reserve_mem 
  sees a zero length as a terminator.
- The code rounded the top down instead of up.
