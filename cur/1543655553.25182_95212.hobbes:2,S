Tried it with framebuffer console off, same results. Moved agp before vt
in char/Makefile, same. Even manually calling agp_init() doesn't work
because what's really needed is agp_intel_init(). 
Anyway, I guess I'll stick to what I'm doing right now, periodically do
an inter_module_get("drm_agp") until it becomes available.
