What if 'singlethread_cpu' dies?

What abt __create_workqueue/schedule_on_each_cpu?

I guess it depends on how __create_workqueue/schedule_on_each_cpu is
modified (whether we take/release lock upon LOCK_ACQ/LOCK_RELEASE)

What abt stopping that thread in CPU_DOWN_PREPARE (before freezing
processes)? I understand that it may add to the latency, but compared to
the overall latency of process freezer, I suspect it may not be much.
