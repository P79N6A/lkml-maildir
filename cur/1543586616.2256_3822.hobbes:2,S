Actually, there is a significant difference between the HP patch and
the one I developed.  In the HP patch, if there is a schedulable task
on the 'local' (current CPU) runqueue it will ignore runnable tasks on
other (remote) runqueues.  In the multi-queue patch I developed, the
scheduler always attempts to make the same global scheduling decisions
as the current scheduler.
