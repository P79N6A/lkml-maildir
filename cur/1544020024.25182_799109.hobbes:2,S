OK, so we're not aware of anything in there which will trigger the bug
yet.  Although allocate_threshold_blocks() takes about half the locks in
the kernel - it can run an ext3 commit, it does netlink tx, synchronous
process exec, etc.
Why not give up and kill the whole work_on_cpu() thing?  afaict the
only caller which cannot be immediately switched to use an IPI is
mce_amd_64's allocate_threshold_blocks(), and it looks like that can be
trivially fixed by moving the entire function except for one rdmsr() up
into the caller.
