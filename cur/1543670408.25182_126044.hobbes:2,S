Well, I was thinking of machines that are really starved of physical
RAM, 32 MB or less, even down to 4 MB.  I generally run swapless on
'real' machines :-).
Also, the higher capcity tracks mean less seeks, so the chance of not
having to seek at all increases slightly.

Yeah, that would probably be a better idea for machines which are only
really hitting swap on occasions, instead of all the time :-).
