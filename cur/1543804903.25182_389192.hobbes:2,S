I did, but I saw drawbacks with that (most notably the fact that all instances are allocated at
once, possibly wasting a lot of memory).

No, I don't see any trickery there (on demand allocation in CPU_UP_PREPARE is being done
elsewhere in very similar ways), and I also didn't see any ordering issues. Hence I also didn't
see any need to explain this in detail.

Why? Each slot is allocated at most once, the BP's is never allocated (it will continue to use the
static one even when brought down and back up).

Not really, as it would be re-used the next time a cpu with the same ID gets brought up (that
is, compared with the current situation there is generally less memory wasted unless all NR_CPUs
are brought up and then one or more down again, in which case the amount of space wasted
would equal [neglecting the slack space resulting from kmalloc's way of allocating]).
