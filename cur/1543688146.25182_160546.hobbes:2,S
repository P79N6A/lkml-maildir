grmpf. Absolutely wrong argumentation. People like me compile kernels a lot, 
for tons of different machines, for customers and so on. My brain is not that 
good that I'll remember each and every customers kernel/machine config ;)
Many people forget to copy the current .config to somewhere else in /boot or 
such. And I agree 100% with Willy :)
P.S.: Alan planed it for .23-pre1 ;-))
ciao, Marc
