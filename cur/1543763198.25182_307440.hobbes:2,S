Users can launch tasks and renice them to lowest priority levels..., with the highset
priority being given by the administrator...I've always though it's gnome/kde fault to launch
the apps at the same nice level than the panel and the window manager. Despite of 
that my "design" wouldn't achieve that such fine-grained control, no - I'd argue that not
many people needs that, but then I shouldn't tell people what they need (and anyway
the previous proposal would so powerful for its simplicity that it might be worth of it doing
it anyway)

I realize that CKRM provides much broader functionality, the alternative I was proposing
was just for CPU resources (and would probably work well for IO bandwith with CFQ),
I realize that things like "partitioning memory resources" is a whole different problem.
But I certainly think that CKRM is far too complex - the docs I've read spent all the time
describing things like classes, classes inhretance, classification engine, resources
scheduler, resource schedulers configuration and so on. I must admit I've not read too
much about CKRM - I had to stop because I couldn't understand it, everything is far too
complex to my little mind, and I'm saying this because I bet I'm not the only one here
who can't understand it either.....
