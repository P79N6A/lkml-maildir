where "recently" is last september....
bloating the kernel unused since then...

if NFS indeed is going to use this in a month then you're probably
right, bloating all kernels for another few weeks (before 2.6.11 is out
anyway) isn't a big deal. I'm looking forward to nfs using this in this
timeframe...
If it is going to take a LOT longer though I still feel it's wrong to
bloat *everyones* kernel with this stuff.
(you may think "it's only 100 bytes", well, there are 700+ other such
functions, total that makes over at least 70Kb of unswappable, wasted
memory if not more.)
