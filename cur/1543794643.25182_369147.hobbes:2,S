I have created a stripe across two 500Gb disks located on separate IDE
channels using:
mdadm -Cv /dev/md0 -c32 -n2 -l0 /dev/hdb /dev/hdd
the performance is awful on both kernel 2.6.12.5 and 2.6.14.2 (even
with hdparm and blockdev tuning), both bonnie++ and hdparm (included
below) shows a single disk operating faster than the stripe:
----
dkstorage01:~# hdparm -t /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  182 MB in  3.01 seconds =  60.47 MB/sec
dkstorage02:~# hdparm -t /dev/hdc1
/dev/hdc1:
Timing buffered disk reads:  184 MB in  3.02 seconds =  60.93 MB/sec

I am aware of cpu overhead with software raid but such a degradation
should not be the case with raid 0, especially not when the OS is
located on a separate SCSI disk - the IDE disks should just be ready
to work.
There have been some earlier reporting on this problem but they all
seam to end more and less inconclusive (here is one
http://kerneltrap.org/node/4745
). Some people favors switching to
dmraid with device mapper, is this the de facto standard today ?
Examining the setup with mdadm gives:

mdadm is v1.12.0.
