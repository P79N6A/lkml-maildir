Hi, Sam!
When I built the latest linus tree, I got this error:
...
  CC      sound/oss/msnd.o
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/etc/sound/msndperm.bin', needed by `sound/oss/msndperm.c'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [sound/oss] Error 2
make: *** [sound] Error 2
My .config is just the one I sent to you in another thread.
Need me to resend it?
Regards.
