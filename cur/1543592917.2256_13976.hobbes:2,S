This is not a bug. init_or_cleanup is only called from one place with
an argument of 1: from the init() function. If the argument is 0,
as called by the exit() function, the code for calling the ip_nat_rule_setup
is never reached.
So it is definitely not a bug.
Anyway, one should maybe make this a little bit cleaner. Will look into that.
