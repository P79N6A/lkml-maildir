(I probably should have been more verbose in my suggestion;)
What I actually suggested was that you try renicing the application you
were experiencing sluggishness with to -10, and retry your IO
interference test to see if you were experiencing scheduling latency or
something else.  For example, if your GL application is using lots of
cpu, it will likely not be classified as interactive, and can end up in
the expired array, at which time an IO task can do a long burst of heavy
cpu usage at interactive status, and keep your application off of the
cpu for quite a while.  The intent of renicing your application to -10
was to keep it at interactive status, and above the heavy IO tasks. (if
it sleeps at all that should work.  there are other scenarios too, but
less likely than this one) 
If running IO at nice 19 more or less fixes your problem, I think we can
assume that you are having scheduling troubles, so the thing to do is to
grab some top snapshots showing cpu distribution during a problem
period.
