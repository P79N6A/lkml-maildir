Hey, Im running 2.6.9-rc4-mm1, and when i run either a echo 4 > 
/proc/acpi/sleep or echo disk > /sys/power/state  I get the following 
messages:
Stopping tasks: =================|
Freeing memory... done (0 pages freed)
PM: Attempting to suspend to disk.
PM: snapshotting memory.
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:02.7[C] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
Restarting tasks... done
It basically just stops everything, then starts it all back up again 
immediately.  Any idea whats going on here?  This was done right after 
booting and just logging in with no X running.
