I ran into this problem awhile ago on a HP 7/14 as well, with the ide patches
as far back as 2.2.17.  Reported it, didn't get much in responses though :/
I'm just about at the point of giving up on the drives, but not due to Linux.
Those drives are not very durable, tend to die within a year around here.
Tapes last even less.  I've sent 4 drives out of 12 back to HP in the last
year, so far.
