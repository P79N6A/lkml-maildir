As Peter Chubb has stated such control is possible and is available on 
Tru64, Solaris and Windows with Aurema's (<

ARMTech product.  The CKRM project also addresses this issue.

Interactive processes do very well under EBS without any special treatment.
Programs such as xmms aren't really interactive processes although they 
usually have a very low CPU usage rate like interactive processes.  What 
distinguishes them is their need for REGULAR access to the CPU.  It's 
unlikely that such a modification would help with the need for regularity.
Once again I'll stress that in order to cause xmms to skip we had to (on 
a single CPU machine) run a kernel build with -j 16 which causes a 
system load well in excess of 10 and is NOT a normal load.  Under normal 
loads xmms performs OK.

Yes.  Fairness between users rather than between tasks is a sane desire 
but beyond the current scope of EBS.

No, it would not break the O(1) promotion algorithm.
