Hi all,
Does someone know of a way to estimate the instantaneous size of the 
buffer cache for individual devices? For example, if there are two devices 
on your system a)/dev/hda1 and b)/dev/hda2 and each is running a different 
workload. How can we calculate the amount of cache being used by each 
devices individually?
Please advise. Thanks.
Abhishek
