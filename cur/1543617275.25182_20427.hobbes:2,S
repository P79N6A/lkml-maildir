I am in two minds about this (but I am at one with my duality).  Part
of me says that users will want to tweak the initramfs process and they
may want to use different versions of klibc, so klibc and building
initramfs should be outside the kernel build.  Another part says that
users have to build initramfs before doing the install so initramfs and
klibc should be part of kbuild.
It will probably end up with klibc as part of the kernel tarball
supported by kbuild.  Generating initramfs will be done by a script,
kbuild will supply a sample but users can copy and change the sample to
suit their own requirements.
