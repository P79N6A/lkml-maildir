I checked again and its a Intel 815 Board.
Someone told me to use tulip and someone told me to use eepro
looking in the source
eepro100 is only for.
PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82557
PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82559ER
PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_ID1029
PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_ID1030
so none will work :-(
none of the drivers (even in newer kernels) have PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82865
as one of the options :-(
So I guess none are supported? Anyone else help me?
Thanks
Craig Whitmore
