hugetlb areas are not pageable and it's very unlikely that they will become
so in the forseeable future.  So you don't need to do this.
That being said, we shouldn't have broken your application.
I guess a suitable back-compatibility fix would be to check for a hugetlb
vma early on and return "success" for that vma section without actually
doing anything.
But we need to understand why this happened.

That's rather naughty of you ;) You're supposed to use setrlimit() in a
parent process for this...
