If you open e.g. /dev/cam or /dev/scg?, you open device that is not related
to a high level service like /dev/hd* and this unfortunately is unable to talk 
to other devices in the same entity (e.g. ATAPI tapes).
With /dev/cam or similar you get a single handle for a group of devices that 
than are addressed via something very similar to dev=b,t,l
