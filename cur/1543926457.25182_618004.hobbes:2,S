That's a good point. The framework could be used for this. 
We would have to add a kernel API and disable user trace support.
The kernel would probably want to collect trace per cpu, not
per task.
That would be a separate feature that would best go into a different
patch.

Do you mean a patch to the "man ptrace" man page
that would elaborate on the comments I put into 
include/asm-x86/ptrace-abi.h?
This would only be used for discussion in this mailing list, wouldn't
it?

I moved the code to __switch_to_xtra and set the
TIF_WORK_CTXSW_PREV/NEXT bits. 
It looks better, now, thanks.

If I cached the MSR value and only wrote it in the enable/disable
routines, 
I might implicitly undo somebody else's changes to other bits in that
MSR.
Also, this code is not performance critical as it is executed only
when switching to/from tasks that are being debugged.

I replaced it with a macro PTRACE_BTS_MAX_BTS_SIZE that is #defined 
at the beginning of that source file.

The underlying problem is that the address size in the DS and the BTS 
depend on the processor mode as well as on the processor architecture. 
Netburst, for example, uses 32bit pointers in 32bit mode and 64bit 
pointers in 64bit mode.
Core2, on the other hand, uses 64bit pointers in both modes.
While the processor mode is known statically, the processor architecture
is not.
I chose to model this using completely separate data structures and
operations for each architecture variant to simplify adding support for 
new architectures.
For some of the operations, I could instead store a handful of
parameters 
in an architecture specific struct and use a common operation. For
example, 
I could store the size of the DS and BTS buffers, or the enable/disable 
bit-masks.
This would result in some kind of hybrid that I think is slightly harder
to understand and extend, but does not have a real benefit except for a 
marginal code size reduction.
How strongly do you think this needs to be changed?
I added the #ifdef __i386__ in order to get rid of some ugly type-cast 
warnings for cases that do not actually occur in practice. 
For __i386__ I need to cast 32bit pointers into 64bit pointers and vice 
versa for architectures that use 64bit DS and BTS pointers in 32bit
mode.
For __x86_64__ I never need to do that casting, so I chose to
conditionally 
compile that code.
>Also it's unclear why you got different MSR access functions for 32bit 
>and 64bit.
Actually, I got different MSR access functions for different processors,
because I need to touch different bits in that MSR. They just happen to 
collide with the 32bit/64bit distinction.

I will move the call to ptrace_bts_init_intel() into the intel setup
code
and leave the function itself in ptrace_bts.c. This will obsolete the 
PTRACE_BTS_INIT command.
>Also do you have user space to use this?
The main target for this feature are application debuggers. We are
currently 
talking to gdb developers (internally) to have gdb make use of it.
thanks and regards,
markus.
