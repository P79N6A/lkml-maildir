Hmm. "Linux Device Drivers" says about wait_event_interruptible(wq, 
condition): ''Note that @condition may be evaluated an arbitrary number 
of times, so it should not have any side effects.''
Alas the hpsb_get_tlabel_atomic() _does_ have a side effect, but only 
when !hpsb_get_tlabel_atomic(packet) is true.
The current implementation of wait_event_interruptible() seems to 
evaluate @condition multiple times if it is false but only _once_ while 
it is true. May I rely on this fact or do I have to rewrite the 
condition to be completely free of side effects?
I don't believe there would be ever a sensible implementation of 
wait_event_interruptible() which would evaluate @condition again after 
it became true.
Thanks,
