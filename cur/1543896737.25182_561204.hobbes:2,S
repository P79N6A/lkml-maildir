Hugh's patch not address the complete issue. It only works right now 
because the size of the allocation is page size and fits right into a slab 
page. If debugging is enabled then the slab size will increase and the 
"pages" will be misaligned which will lead to other sorts of funky 
behavior. kmalloc allocations are only guaranteed to be aligned to 
ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN which is 4 to 8 bytes. If one must have a 
page aligned entity out of a slab allocator then a custom slab needs to be 
created.
