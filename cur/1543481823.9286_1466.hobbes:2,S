Subject: fatal kernel oops and ksymoops compile error

Hi, I got a fatal oops within half an hour of trying 2.2.0-pre9. As I'd
also just flashed my bios, I'm slightly hesitant about blaming the
kernel.
I seem to be missing a header file called bfd.h which is required for
ksymoops. Any suggestions on where I can get this file, or compile
without it?
The oops (written by hand) is attached, just in case it holds any clues
without the symbol table. (the symbol table is available on request; I'm
not sending it in because thats a waste of bandwidth).
ps my mail drop is acting up right now, so please reply to the list.
pps I get the message Symbol table has incorrect version number in my
syslog. I hope this is normal for prepatches.
