The OOM killer gets that part right; it kills all threads that share the
same mm.   Where it screws up is in picking the process to kill.
This is understandable, since it's a tough problem.
Hey, how about this: I could teach the OOM killer to look at
RLIMIT_RSS.  Processes which were at or nearly at their RLIMIT_RSS
would be killed first.  That would be more generally useful than
my hacky little patch, and it would be even tinier.  Like this, say:
--- oom_kill.c.orig	Thu Sep 26 17:31:12 2002
+++ oom_kill.c	Thu Sep 26 17:36:44 2002

How's that look?
