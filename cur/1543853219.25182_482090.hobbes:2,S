The BIOS is advising you here that it is a bad idea to enable the LAPIC on this system.
So why are you using the "lapic" boot parameter?
If you are running an CONFIG_SMP kernel with LAPIC enabled and deep C-states
(such as are available on Thinkpads when on battery mode), you will
run into the following bug:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7376
As this is not new, the mystery is really why you see no problems in 2.6.18.
Perhaps you can forward the contents of /proc/interrupts for 2.6.18 with "lapic"
and we can see if the timer and the LOC are in sync or not when on battery?
/proc/acpi/processor/*/power will also tell us about the C-states --
dump it for both AC and battery mode.
thanks,
