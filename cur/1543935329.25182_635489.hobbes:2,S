Forget my previous question, as I understand now that I gave it a more
serious though, that it is not a matter of driver, but an
incompatibility between the two in the layer/media carrier level.
I was dreaming :-)

Is there a kernel driver that would make a NIC's port work as a RS232
port, using the serial cables that are RJ45 on one side and DB9 or DB25
on the other? Maybe null modem cables of that type ? Or for example
those used by cisco as console port cables?
(or may be I'm dreaming ;-)
