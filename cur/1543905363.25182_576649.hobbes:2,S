( side-note: you can ignore the lock validator stuff here, the validator
  changes are supposed to a NOP on the !lockdep case. Local irqs will
  only be disabled if the validator is running. This could cause dropped
  serial irqs on very old boxes but i doubt anyone will want to run the
  validator on those. )

So the whole locking is to be able to keep irqs enabled for a long time, 
without risking entry of the same IRQ handler on this same CPU, correct?
Marcin's test results suggest that if an IRQ is resent right at the 
enable_irq() point [be that via the hw irq-resend mechanism or the sw 
irq-resend mechanism], the hang happens.
In the previous 2.6.20 logic we'd not normally generate an IRQ at that 
point (because we masked the irq and the card itself deasserts the line 
so any level-triggered irq is now moot).
Once Thomas hacked off this resend mechanism for level-triggered irqs, 
Marcin saw the hangs go away.
So it seems to me that maybe the driver could be surprised via these 
spurious interrupts that happen right after the irq_enable(). Does the 
patch below make any sense in your opinion?
