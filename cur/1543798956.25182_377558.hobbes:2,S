I rechecked what I did in the m68k tree. The basic idea is that 
<asm/irq.h> is mostly a private header (basically our <linux/irq.h>),
so if we move something around I would prefer the NR_IRQS definition.
I tried that, but it broke a few other dependencies, so I changed it that 
the (public) hardirq.h includes the (private) irq.h.
Basically what we need is a clear separation between private/public and 
low/high level irq header. For example <linux/interrupt.h> is high level 
header (it even pulls in <linux/sched.h>!) but it defines irqreturn_t 
which is also useful in lower level irq headers.
Christoph, what exactly is your plan regarding irq.h/hardirq.h?
bye, Roman
