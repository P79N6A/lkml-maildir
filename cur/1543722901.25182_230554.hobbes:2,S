Most of us that use swsusp regularly have our pre-suspend script unload usb before suspend to 
prevent exactly this sort of behaviour.
I also unload PCMCIA.
If there is something using these devices that prevents unloading, then my script notifies me that 
I'm doing something I need to stop before I suspend. Can't remember the last time that happened though.
Check out the swsusp-devel list for further info.

Brad
