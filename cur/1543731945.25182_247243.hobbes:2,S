Man, this thread came a long way.  I peek in and see a pet topic...
_My_ own definition of microkernel, which differs from traditional CS, 
is where I would love to see Linux go:  move as much as humanly possible 
to userspace, such that, the kernel only contains pagecache operations, 
driver fast paths, and security checks.  Move slow paths, including ACPI 
probing, PCI bus walking, driver init/reset paths, some of the ioctl 
handling, to userspace.  Be willing to accept extra context switches as 
a cost in all but the fast paths.
What you have left after you move all the slow paths to userspace is my 
version of a microkernel.  The kernel is still monolithic and a single 
address space, but a lot smaller.
Now this (a) is likely just a pipe dream and (b) will increase 
complexity because each driver will _require_ a userspace component, but 
hey... you gotta have goals in life.
