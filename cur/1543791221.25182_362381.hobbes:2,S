Hi all,
Sorry for the noise, but need experts :-)
This is most probably nothing to do with the kernel, but I am at a total lose 
and have exhausted all avenues after 5 days of finally getting around to 
looking into this to find out WHY I am the _only person in the world_ that 
seems to get this issue - two accesses to /dev/agpgart on startx - or X raw 
(or any other combination of X)
Please refer to this original mail:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/22/295
2.6.14 - agpgart and via-agp built in - use nVidia driver (I know, I know) on 
Geforce4 MX440 SE.
I have traced startx->xinit->startkde to no avail.
I have been on to the xorg people in irc - no-one there has ever seen similar 
(get on to nVidia)...
I coded in a pci AGP device counter in generic.c, and it does report that it 
gets accessed twice (counter resets after leaving that routine):
agpgart: Found an AGP 2.0 compliant device at 0000:00:00.0.
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 0000:00:00.0 into 4x mode - count 1
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 0000:01:00.0 into 4x mode - count 2
agpgart: Found an AGP 2.0 compliant device at 0000:00:00.0.
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 0000:00:00.0 into 4x mode - count 1
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 0000:01:00.0 into 4x mode - count 2
xorg logs here ->

So, is there anyway I can 'watch' /dev/agpgart to see what does this?
Many thanks,
Nick
