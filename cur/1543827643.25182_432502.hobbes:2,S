FUTEX_REQUEUE certainly should be able to requeue from normal futex
to a PI futex or vice versa, I don't think it is desirable to create
a separate futex cmds for that.
Now not sure what do you mean by "use PI futexes all along in glibc",
certainly you don't mean using them for normal mutexes, right? 
FUTEX_LOCK_PI has effects the normal futexes shouldn't have.
The condvars can be also used with PP mutexes and using PI for the cv
internal lock unconditionally wouldn't be the right thing either.
