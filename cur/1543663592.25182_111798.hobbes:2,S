# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
# Project Name: Linux kernel tree
# This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#	           ChangeSet	1.1024  -> 1.1025 
#	drivers/pnp/resource.c	1.8     -> 1.9    
#	drivers/pnp/manager.c	1.3     -> 1.4    
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 03/02/22	ambx1@neo.rr.com	1.1025
# Resource Management Performance Fix
# 
# Fixes a typo in pnp_check_*_conflicts functions.  Without this fix the
# resource algorithm will work but will take longer to assign resources.
# 
# Also contains some minor reordering in pnp_activate_dev.
# --------------------------------------------
