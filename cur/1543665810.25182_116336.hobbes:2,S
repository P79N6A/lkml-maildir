Use less cache for the hash table overall.
Use less lowmem.
Ideally there would be no tradeoff if you can still get reasonable 
hash chain length with smaller tables (= overall win)

At least I don't know how to improve it.

I doubt inode cache is very critical, except perhaps in NFS server loads
(but even the nfs server has an own frontend cache)
Normally the dcache should bear most of the load.
