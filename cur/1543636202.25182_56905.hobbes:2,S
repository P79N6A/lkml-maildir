Hi,
I upgraded from 2.4.19-pre7 to -rc1 and this resulted in my aha152x card not
working anymore. (The error was "trying software interrupt, lost")
Below is a patch which makes it work again. Note that this is just reverting
a minimal part of the last applied patch to aha152x.c; so this may only be
fixing the symptom and not the problem.
Can somebody confirm if this is correct or not, and give some more insight
into this behaviour?
Regards,
Filip
