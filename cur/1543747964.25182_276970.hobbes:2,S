I missed the beginings of this thread. Seems some patch was posted
on lkml which started this discussion. I am pretty sure what the lkml
FAQ says is to post on netdev. Ok, If you insist posting on lkml
(because that the way to glory, good fortune and fame), then please have
the courtesy to post to netdev.  
Now lets see if we can help. Followups only on netdev.
cheers,
jamal
