Well, maybe it would be time to assign limits to ramfs. I have a patch for
this in all my own 2.4 kernels that I use on appliances, network boot and
bootable CDs. It was a bit tricky to get the limits to work well in 2.4
because it was not easy to track which pages were used by whom. But I presume
that rmap in 2.6 should help a lot.
If someone is willing to give this a try, here's the 2.4 patch :
