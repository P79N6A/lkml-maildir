	Use different inline functions for signed and unsigned.
Explicitly.
	Any scheme trying to imitate polymorphism with use of cpp/
GNU extensions/whatever is missing the point.  There is _no_ common
operation to extend on several types.  Choice between signed and
unsigned max should be explicit - they are different operations.
	Trying to hide that is C++itis of the worst kind - false
polymorphism that hides only one thing: subtle bugs.
