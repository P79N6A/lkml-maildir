This suggestion has two rather large problems:
(a) Non-overcommit is a useful reliability feature: the VM guarantees
	(well, with 99% probability) it will not be forced to randomly
	kill processes, but instead return -ENOMEM when there isn't
	enough memory.
(b) Once overcommit is enabled, it can't be reliably disabled.
