[resent with the patch gzipped attached since it was too big]
The attached removes obsolete #if'd code for kernel 2.0 and 2.2 from
wan code (this includes the expansion of some #define's that were
definded differently for different kernel versions).
This patch does not include my earlier patch for drivers/net/wan/lmc/*.
I've tested the compilation with 2.5.59.

       "Is there not promise of rain?" Ling Tan asked suddenly out
        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
