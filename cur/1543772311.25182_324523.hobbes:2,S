We have a large lvm2 logical volume (6.91T) which contains a JFS
filesystem. The volumes accessed via emulex FC HBAs connected to a
nexsan SAN.  There was a bug in the SAN firmware that caused the
primary controller to lose sync with the other controller and go down.
 Normally when this happens we are able to reboot the SAN and the
server and then run fsck on the volume, and everything is fine (on a
side note, we have updated the SAN firmware to fix the sync problem). 
however, fsck now segfaults and the volume is dirty so it can't be
mounted. lvdisplay and vgdisplay seem to work fine displaying the
correct info.  Does anyone know what may be causing the problem or how
we can fix it?  If possible I'd like to save the data on the volumes.

mount /mnt/san
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/vg00/lvol0,

Additional info:
Linux nutcracker 2.6.12-rc6 #1 SMP Wed Jun 8 16:46:17 EDT 2005 x86_64 AMD
Opteron(tm) Processor 244 AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux
That's the only kernel version (2.6.12) that has support for a fiber channel
Emulex card (lpfc).
Thanks in advance for any help or advice.
