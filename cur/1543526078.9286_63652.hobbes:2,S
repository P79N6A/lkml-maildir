I have been getting frequent locks, with the message "hda losing interrupt"
when using the 2.3.42 or 2.3.45 kernel.
My motherboard is an ASUS K7M v1.04, which uses the VIA VT82C686A
southbridge. This is an athlon system, and I am compiling the kernel with gcc
2.95.2.
Everything works fine with 2.3.29 and 2.2.12.
I would appreciate it if anyone having similar problems with this board, and
has a patch or some idea what is wrong would email me directly, as I am not on
the linux-kernel mailing list currently.
