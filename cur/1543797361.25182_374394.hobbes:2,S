On Opterons the NUMA factors are usually < 2, more towards 1, but people
definitely note a difference between node and off node.
So I don't think that's a good heuristic. 
I would use > LOCAL_DISTANCE or perhaps if you really want
a new constant with value 12-15.

Well if anything it would be per system - perhaps need to make
it a boot option or somesuch later.
