So, there will still be ways to bypass Win98 or MacOS or whatever. When
there is no 100% safe way that the OS can prevent
RESERVED/ILLEGAL/whatever commands, why try to have the OS do it WHILE
IT CANNOT 100% SUCCEED?
I feel the drive itself would be the proper place to protect from
fradulescent software, from bogus commands and the like.
I really cannot see anything wrong with a jumper on the drive that is
default uninstalled and will only allow firmware upgrades and other
vendor-specific commands when set? That's the safe and politically
correct way IMHO.
I don't think vendors can void an air bag's warranty if your child
presses the wrong buttons on your car telephone either.
