It shouldn't ever lead to segfaults.  At worst, you should get poor
performance because the hypervisor emulates the -ve segment offset.

This looks OK.  If this doesn't work, then it suggests there's something
wrong with the kernel vdso which is not exporting the nonegseg
(pseudo-)hardware capability.  But we've gone over this several times
now, and I was fairly sure we'd finally got it right - works for me, at
least.
The alternative is that there's some bug on the userspace side in your
version of Ubuntu...

As I said, you shouldn't be seeing crashes either way.  If you are, it
suggests a hypervisor bug.  Does "xm dmesg" show anything?

nosegneg is still necessary, and it should still be working as it did
before.

Yeah, anything which isn't 2.6.18-xen isn't officially "Xen project",
but its worth reporting the bugs to xen-devel (and Ubuntu, of course). 
And to me, for that matter.  I won't be able to help directly, but the
crashes may highlight things we need to be careful about in the pvops
Xen support.
