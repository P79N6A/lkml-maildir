Hi Andrew,

I'm awaiting feedback om the smsc37b787_wdt.c driver
from Sven (about the spin_lock's, just to be sure that
we didn't make any mistakes).
Also w83697hf_wdt should be added, Sam and Marcus
wrote their drivers at almost the same moment.
Sam tested the latest version, but I'm going to ask
Marcus also to test the latest driver.
The iTCO_wdt driver will probably follow this evening.
Greetings,
Wim.
Note: I will also rebuild the -mm tree tonight so that
it's back in sync with linus' tree.
