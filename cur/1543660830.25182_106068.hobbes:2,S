BTW, we still need a separate isa_request_mem_region(), since right now we
cannot simply call request_mem_region(0xa0000, 0x10000) to request the VGA
memory buffer in ISA memory space. On ia32 the plain request_mem_region() is
OK, but on other archs you need to add the ISA memory space base.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
