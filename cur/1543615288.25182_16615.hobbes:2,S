Given decoding DMI isn't going to get you 100% fool proof way of
detecting slots (See posts on laptops/other usually-with-crap-bios
hardware), I think you're barking up the wrong tree with this
anyway.
And if you don't know what hardware you've got in the box your
configuring a kernel for, its questionable that you should be
doing so in the first place.
