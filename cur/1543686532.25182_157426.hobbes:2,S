My patch always called shutdown before remove, but only if the methods
are implemented.  Mandating that shutdown and remove are implemented 
is not something I am changing with this patch.

Hmm.  That is a very weird case.  Semantically the keyboard driver
and everything else should be removed in any case.
After device_shutdown is called it is improper for any driver
to be handling interrupts because the are supposed to be in a quiescent
state.  And if they are not it is likely to break a soft reboot.

Reasonable.  And they still get that knowledge with the way I implemented
my patch.  They just get to shutdown first.
Russell do you have any objects to always calling shutdown before
remove?   I don't think this looses knowledge and in most cases it should
work, but if there are bus devices were we need to do things significantly
differently I am open to other solutions.
All I really care about is that we get something that is simple enough
that device driver authors can get it right.  And according to my limited
testing we don't have that right now.
