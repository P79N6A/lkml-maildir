Subject: Opinions on removing /proc/tty?

Does anyone use the info in /proc/tty? The hard coded device names
aren't compatible with udev's ability to rename things.
There also doesn't appear to be any useful info in the drivers portion
that isn't already available in sysfs. I can add some code to make a
list of registered line disciplines appear in sysfs.
Does anyone have a problem with deleting /proc/tty if ldisc enum
support is added to sysfs?
