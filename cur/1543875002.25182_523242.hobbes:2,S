That's Dave's point, I believe. Limiting mapped memory may be
mostly OK for well behaved applications, but it doesn't do anything
to stop bad ones from effectively DoSing the system or ruining any
guarantees you might proclaim (not that hard guarantees are always
possible without using virtualisation anyway).
This is why I'm surprised at efforts that go to such great lengths
to get accounting "just right" (but only for mmaped memory). You
may as well not even bother, IMO.
Give me an RSS limit big enough to run a couple of system calls and
a loop...
