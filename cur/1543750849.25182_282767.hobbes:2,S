We've talked about doing this but AFAIK nobody has gotten round to it yet 
because there hasn't been a pressing need (IIRC, it was on the todo list when 
Xen 1.0 came out).
IMHO, it doesn't look terribly difficult but would require (hopefully small) 
modifications to the architecture independent code, plus a little bit of 
support code in Xen.
I'd quite like to look at this one fine day but I suspect there are more 
useful things I should do first...
Cheers,
Mark
