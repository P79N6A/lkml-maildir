I thought about using a direct call for s390 as well. The advantage of a
direct call is that it avoids the overhead of a notifier call even if
kprobes is running. The disadvantage is that there cannot be a second
consumer of the fault notifications. I choose the middle way: avoid the
overhead if kprobes is not active and use the full notifier if kprobes
is running. It should not hurt the performance too badly since
kprobe_running is only true if the cpu gets a page fault while executing
a kprobe.
