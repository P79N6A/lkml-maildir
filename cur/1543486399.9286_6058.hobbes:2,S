Yes, I should have been clearer. I realize we cant ensure application
level consistency from an OS level, what im mostly concerned about is
filesystem consistency. I lost count of the times ive had to poke around
lost+found to recover the filesystem layout. Or the times e2fsck has
required manual intervention to complete its checking. :(
The 2 hour e2fsck's is purely a secondary concern, but its still annoying.
It might be interesting to have a kernel level transaction facility
available to applications...
