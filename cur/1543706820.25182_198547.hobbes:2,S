kjournald was calling ll_rw_block() with a bunch of bh's and
PG_writeback was not set.
A subsequent __block_write_full_page()  with the
page locked, sees that none of the bh(s) for that page
are dirty.  PG_PageWriteback would be set, unlock_page()
and then see no buffers to submit, so clear PG_Page_Writeback
(but buffer i/o still in flight).  filemap_fdatawait() has
nothing to wait for.
I think we agree.

No problem.  I will code this up and give it a try.
My only concern is that a racing mpage_writepages(WB_SYNC_NONE)
with a mpage_write_pages(WB_SYNC_ALL) from a filemap_write_and_wait. 
Both could be processing the io_pages list, if the
mpage_writepages(WB_SYNC_NONE) moves a page that has locked buffers 
back to the dirty_pages list, then when the filemap_write_and_wait()
calls filemap_fdatawait, it will not wait for the page moved back
to the dirty list.
I'll code up the change and run my tests and let you know what happens.
Thanks,
Daniel
