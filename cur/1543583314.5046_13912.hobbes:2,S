A negative module use count (specifically "-1") depends on whether a
module has a "can_unload" routine.  If it does not have a "can_unload"
routine, then chances are either the module decided "I can never be
removed" or else the module is buggy.
However, if a "can_unload" routine does exist (as in ipv6) then the
module use count is unconditionally set to "-1".
