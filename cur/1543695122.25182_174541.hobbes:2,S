test5 didn't work with dbt2.  The database run kept hanging.
I've been running reaim, which doesn't have those problems with
older kernels, but has shown similar performance problems.
I need to also check again that reaim and dbt2 still show similar
performance issues with newer kernel versions.
I've lost my test machine for today.  But I'll try test5 as-iosched
in a test8 kernel with reaim tomorrow.  If it works well, I'll try your
following patch.  Probably get it in the mail tomorrow afternoon.
