   If you really want to do this Press release keep it simple.
   And if you really wanna do it, you can put together a press
   package with quotes etc. for journalists to use.
   Ofcourse, IMHO, linux-kernel doesn't need to do a press release ;
   a simple announcement from Linus in the usual places
   will do nicely. The press will jump on it fast enough.
The informed press who are already watching Linux will jump on it.
What we really want is to get some interest from the people who
haven't heard of Linux, or who are ignoring it, or who are thinking
about it, but are not sure where to start.
