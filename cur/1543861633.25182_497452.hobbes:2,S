Hello,
[please CC me upon replying - thank you]
I have a Highpoint 370 PCI IDE controller, and both my 2.6.18.2 and 
Knoppix 5's 2.6.17 display the following messages:

(hdf is naked, there's no error in partition detection)
The same messages appear when manually trying to enable DMA with hdparm. 
The hdparm reading of hde is:
> /dev/hde:
>  multcount    = 16 (on)
>  IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
>  unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
>  using_dma    =  0 (off)
>  keepsettings =  0 (off)
>  readonly     =  0 (off)
>  readahead    = 256 (on)
>  geometry     = 65535/16/63, sectors = 78165360, start = 0
hda, which is on the mainboard controller and works as hde used to as 
well, reads:
> /dev/hda:
>  multcount    = 16 (on)
>  IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
>  unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
>  using_dma    =  1 (on)
>  keepsettings =  0 (off)
>  readonly     =  0 (off)
>  readahead    = 256 (on)
>  geometry     = 65535/16/63, sectors = 117231408, start = 0
In the controller's setup utility, I can choose access modes. If i 
switch it from UDMA5 to PIO0, the only difference during boot is:
> ide2: BM-DMA at 0xa000-0xa007, BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:pio
instead of
> ide2: BM-DMA at 0xa000-0xa007, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:DMA
Please help me getting DMA to work with this controller.
Thanks in advance,
