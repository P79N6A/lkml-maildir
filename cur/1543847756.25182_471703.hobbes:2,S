It wasn't my intention to sneak in shared page table, though it does
sort of look like so.

OK, I was about to do so too.

It's coming from do_mmap_pgoff(), file->f_op->mmap can fail with error
code (e.g. not enough hugetlb page) and in the error recovery path, it
nulls out vma->vm_file first before calls down to unmap_region().  I
asked that question before: can we reverse that order (call unmap_region
and then nulls out vma->vmfile and fput)?
unmap_and_free_vma:
        if (correct_wcount)
                atomic_inc(&inode->i_writecount);
        vma->vm_file = NULL;
        fput(file);
        /* Undo any partial mapping done by a device driver. */
        unmap_region(mm, vma, prev, vma->vm_start, vma->vm_end);
