Sure it's dirty. It's also fast, with the only overhead being
a few NOPs that could get skipped on syscall return anyway.
Patching overhead is negligible, since it only happens when a
page is brought in fresh from the disk.
The vsyscall stuff costs you on every syscall. It's nice for
when you can avoid entering kernel mode entirely, but in that
case the hack I described above can write out a call to user
code (for time-of-day I imagine) just as well as it can write
out a SYSENTER, INT 0x80, or SYSCALL instruction.
Enter with INT 0x42 if you prefer, or just pick one of the new
instructions.
An alternative would be to hack ld.so to patch the syscalls,
but then you get dirty C-O-W pages in every address space.
Permissions change, swap gets used, etc.
