We cannot merge a kernel change which requires a userspace upgrade to get
the X server working again.
You can do it the other way: make the X server work by default (my patch)
then, in your upgraded userspace, set /proc/sys/kernel/mmap_min_addr to
65536.  
Repeat: I think you should have used /proc/sys/vm/ for that tunable.
