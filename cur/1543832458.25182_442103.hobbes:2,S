That isn't possible neither. How to actually serialize access can
require different set of primitives depending on the storage class of
the memory you are accessing, which the C compiler has 0 knowledge
about. (For example, cacheable storage vs. write-through vs.
non-cacheable guarded vs. non-cacheable non-guarded on powerpc, there
are different issues on other architectures).

ISO C has never been about writing device drivers. There is simply no
choice here. You need an atchitecture specific set of accessors. If you
want portable code, then pick a library like libpci and make sure it
contains all you need on all the architectures you need. Then write
portable code on top of it.

So what is the point ?
