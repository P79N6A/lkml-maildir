NO.
That code should just DIE.
sysconf() isn't even important enough to overdesign for. Why really cares
whether _SC_STREAM_MAX gets the exact right value? I've never seen anybody
use it. 
The way code gets added to the kernel is when somebody cares enough to
write it, and it looks good enough to add.
Code does NOT get added to the kernel just because somebody makes a big
deal of nothing.
