It's clear to me that "X Windows window system" line you quoted is 
poorly worded, but unambiguous.  
But back on topic:
The "hardware assist for Linux kernel" line that I mentioned isn't so
easily explained away.
Does anyone here know what this "hardware assist" is?

	Hmm... What will you say about the following sparkling gem:
"latest Linux X Windows window system"? I mean, WTF? WTF is X Windows
window system, in the first place? And WTF does it have to Linux?
Sorry, but... paint me unimpressed.
