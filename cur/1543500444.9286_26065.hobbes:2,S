Hi Ted,
  thank you for pointing out why revoke is not allowed to close the fd,
maybe you are right that only root/priviliged process should be allowed
to revoke.

  Thank you for the pointer, i looked at the 'destroy-f_ops' loop in hangup,
so acually i think we can share some revoked-stubs with hangup so we don't
need to reinvent the wheel and we have a working revoke without mmap support
already there;
Leaving the mmap issue out for one moment, revoke should be this simple:
static ssize_t ret_null(struct file* filp, char* buf, size_t len, loff_t* off)
{
        return 0;
}
static ssize_t ret_ioerr(struct file* f, const char* buf, size_t s, loff_t* o)
{
        return -EIO;
}
static struct file_operations revoked_fops = {
        NULL,            /* default_llseek gives a good illusion... */
        ret_null,        /* read returns null bytes read */
        ret_ioerr,       /* write gives an IO Error */
        NULL,            /* readdir is not supported... */
        revoked_poll,    /* we will use hangup's poll stub */
        revoked_ioctl,   /* we will use hangup's ioctl stub */
        NULL,            /* no mmap anymore... */
        NULL,            /* open is NULL in hung_up_tty_fops */
        NULL,            /* flush is NULL in hung_up_tty_fops */
        NULL,            /* the fd will be closed later and NULL is ok */
        NULL,            /* fsync is also NULL in hung_up_tty_fops */
        NULL,            /* fasync is also NULL in hung_up_tty_fops */
        NULL,            /* check_media_change is not in hung_up_tty_fops */
        NULL,            /* revalidate is not in hung_up_tty_fops */
        NULL             /* lock is not in hung_up_tty_fops */
};
asmlinkage int sys_revoke(char * path)
{
        int error;
        struct dentry * dentry;
        struct inode * inode;
        struct file * filp;
        lock_kernel();
        dentry = namei(path);
        error = PTR_ERR(dentry);
        if (IS_ERR(dentry))
            goto out;
        if (!capable(CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE)) {
            error = -EPERM;
            goto dput_out;
        }
        inode = dentry->d_inode;
        if (!(inode->i_mode & (S_IFBLK | S_IFCHR))) {
            error = -EINVAL;
            goto dput_out;
        }
        for (filp = inuse_filps; filp; filp = filp->f_next)
                if (filp->f_dentry == dentry) {
                        down(&inode->i_sem);
                        if (filp->f_op && filp->f_op->release)
                                filp->f_op->release(inode, filp);
                        filp->f_op = &revoked_fops;
                        up(&inode->i_sem);
                }
dput_out:
       dput(dentry);
out:
       unlock_kernel();
       return error;
}
Should this be correct?
