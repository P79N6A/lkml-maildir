Greetings all;
I just rebooted to a "still got that new car smell" fresh 2.6.10, and 
this went by on the boot screen while it was starting the various 
services in init.d:
Starting xfs: /etc/rc3.d/S90xfs: line 137:  2377 Segmentation fault      
ttmkfdir -d . -o fonts.scale
/etc/rc3.d/S90xfs: line 137:  2404 Segmentation fault      ttmkfdir 
-d . -o fonts.scale
I had installed some new ttf fonts over the last day or so, and had 
used them with the beta OOo-1.9-xxx before rebooting from 
2.6.10-V0.33-04, but when I did a 'service xfs restart' just before 
seeing if startx worked (it did obviousy) no further errors were 
output, and it was running when I did that, so its apparently not 
repeatable.
But it was a bit puzzling.  Anybody have an idea?  Self-healing 
software, the Holy Grail...
Merry Christmas wishes to all that celebrate it on this list.
