Agree. The rate of change is truly impressive (thank you Andrew and
BK!), but personally I'd like to see things settle down a lot more
quickly. Instead of having 2-3 weeks of continual patch flood, a week or
submitting the stuff that was already done by 2.6.9 by Andrews inclusion
criteria (which I completely agree with) results in -rc1, followed by
2-3 weeks of of truly stabilizing bug fixing. Since by virtue of this
inclusion criteria development for a particular feature/change is
already done by 2.6.9 release, this should be easy [1].
[1] Yeah right, but at least we can try.
