i think you are underestimating Jack - it is easily amongst the most
sophisticated audio frameworks in existence, and it certainly has one of
the most robust designs. Just shop around on google for Jack-based audio
applications. What i'd love to see is more integration (and cooperation)
between the audio frameworks of desktop projects (KDE, Gnome) and Jack.
