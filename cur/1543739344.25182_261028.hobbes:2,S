Your patch:
+       preempt_disable();
        netif_rx_ni(skb);
+       preempt_enable();
just wraps this code in preempt_disable/enable:
static inline int netif_rx_ni(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
       int err = netif_rx(skb);
       if (softirq_pending(smp_processor_id()))
               do_softirq();
       return err;
}
Isn't this considered an incorrect use of preempt_disable/enable?  My
reasoning is that if this was correct we would see preempt_dis/enable
sprinkled all over the code which it isn't.
Why do you have to call do_softirq like that?  I was under the
impression that you raise a softirq and it gets run later.
