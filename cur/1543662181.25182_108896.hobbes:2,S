Hi,
I was just wondering if anyone here is or has any interest in working on a
driver for Broadcom's BCM4301 802.11b chipset.  This chipset is used in a few
products, such as the:
- - Dell TrueMobile 1180
- - Linksys WMP11 (rev 2.7)
If anyone out there has succeeded in getting the developer kit from Broadcom,
I'd appreciate it very much if you could drop me an e-mail.
If not, I'd like to point out a petition that has been started to encourage
Broadcom to release a driver or the specs for the chip.  If you are
interested, you may way to stop by:
