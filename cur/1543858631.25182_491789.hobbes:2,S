Subject: [patch 04/24] EBTABLES: Deal with the worst-case behaviour in loop checks.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/14/423

2.6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>
No need to revisit a chain we'd already finished with during
the check for current hook.  It's either instant loop (which
we'd just detected) or a duplicate work.
