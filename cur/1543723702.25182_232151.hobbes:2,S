Hi!

> There were two changes from the previous patch:
> - clear the PHY_HALF flag if the nic is in half duplex.
> - remove the setflags / setlen helper functions: the ring entries are 
> visible to the hardware, I don't like the read/modify/write cycles.
> 
> It passes my own tests with 100 MBit half duplex, 100 MB full duplex and 
> 1 GBit full duplex.

NVidia has copyright on driver created by reverse engeneering their
hardware? Funny ;-). If NVIDIA really cooperates, perhaps its time to
make the name more friendly to them?
