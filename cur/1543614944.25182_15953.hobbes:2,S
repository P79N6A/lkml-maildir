Hi all,
I wanted to call a timer function to get current time within kernel space. I
don't want any function call to do this.
Any idea ? In AIX we have watchdog stucture and w_stop, w_start, w_init
functions are there to stop, initiate and  start the watchdog timer.
Anything like that is available in linux?
TIA,
Kousalya.
