You are mistaken. The existence of a device is unrekated to the name
someone uses to access it. You may well use /tmp/myowndisk instead
of /dev/hda. In fact some programs do precisely that and use mknod()
to temporarily create a device node with known name, since they
cannot guess what name you may be using for the device.
The kernel also uses names, for example in its boot messages,
and it will call the device hda even when you use /tmp/myowndisk.
There is no intrinsic name for a device - at most a conventional name.
