Subject: fs specific union in struct buffer head? Optimal implementation of  allocate on flush seems to require a b_parent field in struct  buffer_head.

Vladimir and I are discussing how to implement allocate on flush in our next
major version (not for 2.4) of reiserfs.

Do you need b_child?  I think no.  All you really need is b_parent, but
b_left_neighbor and b_right_neighbor might make the code faster.
I think it is entirely appropriate for us to put an fs specific union in struct
buffer_head.  I think avoiding one leads to ugly code.
So as to not waste bytes, we should put #ifdef CONFIG_REISERFS in the
u.reiserfs_bh definition so that it uses 0 bytes if reiserfs is not configured.
Does everyone disagree with me?
I suppose as an alternative we could implement a left neighbor hash, and a right
neighbor hash, and a parent hash, but it would be uglier I think.
