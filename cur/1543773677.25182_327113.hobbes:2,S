FUSE is doing fine outside mainline, so discard wouldn't be such a big
setback.  Including it without unpriv mounts would effectively fork
FUSE into an out-of-tree and an in-tree version, which is sure to
cause confusion.
So yes, I'd prefer not merging to merging without unpriv mounts.  But
it's GPL, so obviously I don't have any legal control over it.

The security measure in question is actually very simple (10 lines or
so).  So it's not the implementation that people have problems with
but the concept.  The concept itself is hard to swallow, because it
does something unexpected, but what it does is in fact very logical.
That's why I ask people to read the documentation, think about it and
_then_ argue.  Up till now the discussion with Christoph Hellwig about
this hasn't been on the level of rational arguments (and he's the only
definite naysayer).
Thanks,
Miklos
