 thinking "sideways" again - as i am wont to do.
 how about... a "sideways" solution to this - at the kernel level?
 a "silent" redirection / remount, on a per-application basis?
 no, i'm not joking.
 an option to "mount" which allows a specific APPLICATION (or group of
 applications) to have any files/directories it creates/accesses in a
 subdirectory ACTUALLY occur ELSEWHERE.
 e.g.:
 mount -o redirectexe=/usr/bin/mozilla-firefox /tmp /tmp/mozilla
 mount -o redirectexe=/usr/bin/gnomeshite,/usr/bin/gnomemoreshite /tmp /tmp/gconf
 hm, that could get out-of-hand - the number of programs involved
 that would need redirection..
 *thinks* ... some other mechanism for "grouping" executables...
 you could even hang it off of an selinux context (!) or selinux domain
 (!) such that a set of executables, possibly those executed by
 certain users, would result in filesystem redirection - but not others.
 at your own discretion.
 then, you _could_ specify /tmp/gconf equals "a different file context".
