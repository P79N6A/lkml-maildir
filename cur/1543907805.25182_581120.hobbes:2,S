Indeed.  Very unfortunate.  I did re-post with a subject but I have not
seen it show up yet, which I have been waiting for to post the solution.
Maybe I will just do that here and again if it shows up with the subject
posted.
The crux of the problem is that the real partitions are being
mapped/managed by device mapper, which is being used by LVM:
$ ls -l /dev/mapper/
total 0
crw-rw---- 1 root root 10, 63 2007-08-08 04:56 control
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      7 2007-08-08 04:56 hda1 -> ../dm-0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      7 2007-08-08 04:56 hda2 -> ../dm-1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      7 2007-08-08 04:56 hda3 -> ../dm-2
This is of course causing those partitions to be opened exclusively,
preventing any further uses (i.e. sys_mount()) from being able to use
them.  Only hda3 of those above is actually an LVM PV.  hda1 is an ext3
filesystem (/boot) and hda2 is a FAT32 (could even be FAT16) filesystem.
Of course, mounting /dev/dm-0 instead of /dev/hda1 solves the problem.
Why this started with Ubuntu's 2.6.22 kernel in Gutsy, I'm not sure.
Whether it's a new DM feature or some change in the way Ubuntu handles
devices, I don't know.  Whatever the case, they need to fix
their /dev/disk/by-uuid mappings anyway:
$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/ | grep hda
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2007-08-08 08:56 12b8250a-d031-4ee1-b486-5e67478d06b4 -> ../../hda1
Cheers,
b.
