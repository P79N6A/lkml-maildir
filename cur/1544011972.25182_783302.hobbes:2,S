Hi all,
After looking at the complete implementation of device mappers, I
figured out that we can have more than one target for a mapped device
then why do we have a check for the number of target to be equal to
one , in dm_blk_ioctl ( ) in drivers/md/dm.c
http://lxr.linux.no/#linux
+v2.6.27.10/drivers/md/dm.c#L337
I think this is a old piece of code and we need to modify it.
Kindly suggest !
