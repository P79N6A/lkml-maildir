Avoiding looking at the kernel source for the darn structure would be 
relatively easy if the thing didn't vary by architecture.  I agree that 
hardwiring into userspace code #ifdefs for ARE_WE_ON_ALPHA is approximately 
as ugly as hardwiring in #ifdefs for IS_THIS_2.6.
Both are ugly.  This is why header files exist.  I still don't understand why 
we're not supposed to use 'em when the alternative is building incestuous 
knowledge about the kernel version we're compiling against into our 
application.
Bluntlly, I don't understand why "#include <linux/version.h>" and several 
#ifdefs is an improvement on "#include <linux/loop.h>" with no #ifdefs.
