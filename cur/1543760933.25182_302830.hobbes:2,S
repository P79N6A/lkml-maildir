This isn't the problem, the fact that if I have all the encryption modes 
turned on I get several hundred lines of output telling me that it tested 
the encryption and got the result it expected is.
you are turning up the verbosity becouse it's needed, if you don't turn it 
down in a few releases (assuming you fix the problems by then ;-) then you 
would become part of the problem.
back in the 1.3/2.0 days when I started useing linux I was a PC repair 
technition and when working on the windows PC's I would use a linux boot 
disk to identify the hardware that was in the machine based on the dmesg 
output (and the ports things were on) so that I could configure the 
windows drivers. So it's not that I can't understand the value of the 
dmesg output, it's that there is now so much additional data that it's no 
longer reasonable to see what's going on.
when the boot dmesg output overflows the 500 line buffer of a VGA console 
so that you can not scroll back and see the messages by the time the 
system starts things have gotten too verbose.
