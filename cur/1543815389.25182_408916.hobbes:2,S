OK, I'll pull from there for further testing.

I can start up the RAID1's on ports 2 and 3, activate the VG on top
of /dev/md5, mount the filesystems, and use them.  I was able to
cp -a the mounted root filesystem from /dev/md2 to a subdir on /dev/sda1.
It was only when I started up a few copies of "tar cf /dev/zero ... &"
that the timeouts began.

Roger.  I'll stare at it a bit longer, but I probably need to order three
SATA adapters.  Any recommendations?  These Tyan 2895 machines all have
2-4 74GB WD Raptors in them.  I don't really need expensive 3ware or
Areca cards for these workstations, just reasonable latencies.
Thanks.
