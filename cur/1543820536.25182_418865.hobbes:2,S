Subject: Telling the kernel that keys need soft release?

Dell laptops have hotkeys on the top of the keyboard for "hibernate", 
"cd eject", "battery status" and so on. These can be mapped to 
appropriate keycodes, and life is good except for the fact that they 
never produce a key release event. The kernel appears to have code to 
deal with this for the hangul key, but it's hardcoded rather than 
generic.
Is there any way for userspace to tell the event layer that a certain 
keycode should have soft-release? If not, would a patch for this be 
accepted?
