I'm afraid I'll have to teach ->nopage how to deal with non-ram with
this page_t API too (changing it to pfn sounds too intrusive in the
short term), it seems to me that alsa can return non-ram (in the nopage
callback there's a virt_to_page on some iomm region), and changing alsa
to use remap_file_pages sounds too intrusive too. 
So in short I believe alsa can corrupt memory randomly starting with
2.6.5-rc1, and it could only generate machine check crashes in previous
kernels.
So for the short term (i.e. next few weeks) we'll have to deal with
page_t still there...
