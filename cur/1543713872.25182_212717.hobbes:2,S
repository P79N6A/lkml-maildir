Yes.  That comment was actually copied from code in the analagous
normal page path (from where it has since been removed).  I've altered
it appropriately.

That seems to me like a "don't do that" situation (you can avoid the
security problem by only giving MAP_SHARED pages to the unprivileged
process).  I don't see a better way to solve this without implementing
some sort of rlimit system for hugepages, which seems like overkill:
As far as I can tell all the real applications (huge databases, HPC,
benchmarks) for hugepages tend to be the sorts of cases where the
hugepage-using program is the only thing you really care about on the
system .

Given that all huge pages are unswappable and therefore effectively
mlock()ed, I don't think so.
