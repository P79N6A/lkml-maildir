#ifdef FOO_CONSOLE around the sunserial_console_match() calls in the  
drivers should work.
If you consider this too many #ifdef's, an alternative solution would be 
doing the following in drivers/serial/suncore.h:
#ifndef MODULE
extern int sunserial_console_match(struct console *, struct device_node *,
                                   struct uart_driver *, int);
#else
static inline int sunserial_console_match(struct console *, struct device_node *,
                                          struct uart_driver *, int);
{ return 0; }
#endif
