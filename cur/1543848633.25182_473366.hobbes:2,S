I actually like the "read only" suggestion that was made. Allow data
access but protect from damage.
Both options will allow 'repair' of a broken partition table as the
partition will show up in fdisk which accesses stuff directly, and when
that causes a revalidate it will re-appear to the kernel.
Incidentally the question of exactly what libata should do about HPA
handling also needs sorting out.
