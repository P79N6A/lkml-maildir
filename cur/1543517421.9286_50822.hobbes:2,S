I agree something needs to be fixed. The the bigger the framebuffer gets
the longer its going to take to do things like clear the framebuffer
kernel side. I have been working on a new fbcon API that will use accel
wrapper to eliminated the latency problems. As for cards that do have
accels I have been working on software emulated accels used for teh
consoel wrapper. What I'm trying to do is to get it to do 64 bit
transfers. Hopefully this will cure the latency problem.
