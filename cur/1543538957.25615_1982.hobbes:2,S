cp -a /ext2-source /reiserfs-dest runs about half the speed of
cp -a /ext2-source /ext2-dest.
However, in general use (for me at least) it seems about the same speed (and the reboot
speed is worth it).
My machine is continually locking up (I suspect my graphics card, since it only happens when X
is running), which may be the cause of
my corruption problems....
