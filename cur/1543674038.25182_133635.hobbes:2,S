For devices that aren't essentialy to get userspace running
(e.g. network on a laptop running from local disk), the firmware
request doesn't have to happen during the hairy part of resumption.
The device could just mark itself as unusable at suspend time, then at
resume it schedule_work()s something to reload the firmware and
complete reinitialization.  Shortly after userspace is back in action,
the device will come back to life.
