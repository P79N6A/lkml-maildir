Hi!
My current 15-pre3 compilation oopses short after boot phase 
(during fs check). Screen output is as follows:
kernel BUG at ll_rw_blk.c:392
invalid operand: 0000
CPU:  0
and other stuff. During that phase RAID0 load is very heavy. After 
that it hangs. SysRQ works, but a reboot is necessary. 
Anyone an idea what this could be?!
