Subject: [PATCH]: why reschedule a disabled tasklet?

	Hi all,
	Attached is a patch i use to get my sparc LX to boot (against 2.4.14). 
Without it the SUN does not work. I'm not sure if this is the right way to 
fix it, but i fail to see way softirq should be raised again if there are no 
enabled  tasklets left. Am i missing anything?
	The SUN got in a deadlock. The schedule() function didn't return
execution to spawn_ksoftirqd, because ksoftirqd kept on doing do_softirqd to 
handle a disabled tasklet (sun_kbd_bh).
	Both my i386 and sun4m seem to run stable with this patch.
