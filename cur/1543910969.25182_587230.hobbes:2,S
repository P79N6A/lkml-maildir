To clear up a small misconception.  It isn't LinuxBIOS but the LinuxBIOS
bootloaders that need to be changed.  A subtle distinction.

Second thinking of this as the empty_zero_page is probably the wrong
mental model of how things work.
At least until HPA's recent changes bzImage is organized as follows:
bootsector (512 bytes)
Various boot protocol variables.
  Some filled in or read by bootloaders 
  some filled in by the real mode code.
real mode code.
32bit Data+Code to load at 1MB.
The empty zero page really is the first 4K or whatever of
the current setup.S.  Any sane bootloader loading the bzImage
will just load the 16bit portion and overwrite the variables
it knows how to fill in.
To ensure there was enough space the code did:

We already have the boot protocol revision and if this is something we
are going to support that should be enough of a revision field.  If
the bootloader can't support what the kernel is doing the bootloader
should just give up.  We have major and minor fields there so we can
distinguish between compatible and incompatible changes as well.
Further that arrangement ensures all of the data fields are initialized.
Further there is no 4K limit when used that way except as a convention
and as an implementation detail.  The bootloaders don't care.  The
have to load all of the 16bit real mode section.
I need to review HPA changes a little more from his rewrite in C.
I think he messed up with the guarantee of initialization in that
rewrite, but I'm not quite certain.
