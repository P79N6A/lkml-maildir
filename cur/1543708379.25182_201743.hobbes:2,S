The numbers I'm fishing out of things say that the PRD table can't
exceed 64KB in size as it can't cross a 64KB boundary and its length
is specified as a 16-bit byte count, so some other method of sizing
the thing may be in order. I do recall something went wrong at the
time I ran into this. If I turn up where I thought the number 256 came
from I'll cite it.
