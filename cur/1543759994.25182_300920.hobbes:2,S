Hello mem-map gurus,
If one uses x = __get_dma_pages(GFP_KERNEL, nr), finds the physical
address with b = virt_to_bus(x), then attempts to mmap(,,b,,,) the result
_does_not_fail_, yet the user ends up with memory ...somewhere....
that is R/W able and WRONG.
Yet, if the code executes SetPageReserved(virt_to_page(x)), the
mmap() works and the user gets the CORRECT page(s).
I think that if mmap() needs a physical buffer to be reserved
then that's fine. However, silently returning some different
buffer is a BUG.
Is anyone aware of this BUG? Does anybody else care?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
