Heck no -- the list you sent only further enforces the notion that most 
of this can be in userspace.
Sure, some of the facilities you list are completely in the kernel -- 
but it is best IMO to control them from userspace.  That allows for 
flexibility when it comes to policy decisions being made (if any) as 
well as increased cleanliness of kernel code.
