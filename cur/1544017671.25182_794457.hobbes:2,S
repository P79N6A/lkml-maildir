It'd be nice if we could modify _notifier_call_chain() to push the 
locking out a bit so we don't need to drop the lock before calling the
notifier.  On the other hand, for anything that isn't memory mapped or
GPIO controlled (most regulators are in this category) the cost of the
I/O is going to make this a non-issue.
