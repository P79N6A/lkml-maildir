It's far easier for a mobo manufacturer to remove the connectors and
PCB tracking for the connections.  For all we know, PCI southbridges
with serial ports integrated into them may still be cheaper in quantity
than ones without - so if mobo manufacturers want to get rid of the
serial ports their easiest way is to omit the connectors and associated
PCB tracks.

The southbridge typically contains the other things like the RTC, etc.
What you're suggesting isn't just a case of "removing a chip" - it's
more a case of designing a replacement without a lot of the legacy
stuff in.
