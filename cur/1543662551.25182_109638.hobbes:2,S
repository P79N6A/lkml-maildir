I believe this driver will work for any PCI/EISA bridge without
any changes, not only for i82375. Probably we need to look for a
class code rather than a device id.
Also, to get rid of that x86-ism I'd suggest something like
	i82375_root.dev		     = &pdev->dev;
	i82375_root.dev->driver_data = &i82375_root;
-	i82375_root.bus_base_addr    = 0; /* Warning, this is a x86-ism */
-	i82375_root.res		     = &ioport_resource;
+	i82375_root.res		     = pdev->bus->resource[0];
+	i82375_root.bus_base_addr    = pdev->bus->resource[0]->start;
	i82375_root.slots	     = EISA_MAX_SLOTS;
Without that you'll have resource conflicts on multi-hose alphas.
Otherwise, the patch looks good to me.
Ivan.
