timer_resume, which appears to be the problem, wants to calculate amount 
of time was spent suspended, also your unconditional irq enable in 
get_cmos_time breaks the atomicity of device_power_up and would deadlock 
in sections of code which call get_time_diff() with xtime_lock held. I 
sent a patch subject "APM: fix interrupts enabled in device_power_up" 
which should address this.
