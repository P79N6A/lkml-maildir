Since you're getting to this point I think this has to be some kind of 
BIOS interaction causing this. The only thing that happens after the 
"Entering sleep state" is that the kernel writes to some ACPI registers 
to tell the hardware to power down. I think some laptop BIOSes do things 
on ACPI power down like try to park the drive heads, etc. and maybe this 
change that you found from git bisecting is somehow interfering with it 
doing this?
Might want to check for a BIOS update first of all..
