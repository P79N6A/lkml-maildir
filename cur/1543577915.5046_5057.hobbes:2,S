I really think the zerocopy network stuff should be ported
to kiobuf proper.
The usefulness of the patch you posted is rather .. umm ..
limited. Having proper kiobuf support would make it possible
to, for example, do zerocopy network->disk data transfers
and lots of other things.
Furthermore, by using kiobuf for the network zerocopy stuff
there's a good chance the networking code will be integrated.
Otherwise we just might end up with a zero-copy-for-everything-
except-networking Linux 2.5 kernel ;)

Rik
