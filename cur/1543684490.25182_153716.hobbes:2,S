MegaRAID driver version 2.00.7 is released and can be download from
ftp://ftp.lsil.com/pub/linux-megaraid/drivers/version-2.00.7/
Changes from 2.00.6:
i.	Adapter lock re-definition so that patch for kernels w/o per host
lock
	is less intrusive - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
ii.	While in abort and reset handling, check for non-empty pending list
is
	invalid. The intent is to wait for pending commands in FW to
complete,
	not the pending commands with the driver - Atul Mukker
