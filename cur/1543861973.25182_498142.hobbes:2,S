I applied it, but looking closer at it, it becomes clear that Roman didn't 
understand the problem with that patch.
This part:
	const char __init linux_banner[] =
CANNOT work, because the stupid SuSE tool that look into the kernel binary 
searches for "Linux version " as the thing, and as such the "linux_banner" 
has to be the _first_ thing to trigger it for it to work.
Which is why "__init" is wrong. It causes the linker to either put it at 
the end of the thing (which would break the SuSE tool). Alternatively it 
causes section mismatch problems ("init" and "const" don't work that well 
together), in which case it might work, but only due to toolchain bugs.
Grr.
