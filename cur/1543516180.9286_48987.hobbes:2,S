I own an obscure soundcard (in sense that it fits into a custom slot on
my motherboard) that works with the mad16.c driver, except that the MIDI
port is not detected. Tests with the Windows driver seem to indicate
that this card acts as an MPU401 compatable, providing that the card's
own registers are correctly configured, which is acheived by a small
device driver at boot-up.
Hacking around with the driver indicates that this card is being
detected as the earliest release of the card, a model which did not
support the MPU-401 option at all, and the driver is failing. I have
modified the code, but the probe mechanism in uart401.c fails.
There is some hairy code that supposedly writes to the correct register
to enable the MIDI port, but it is not well commented and I can't
understand what it is exactly attempting to do. Also hardware specs are
impossible to obtain as the manufacturer no longer makes soundcards.
I need some guidelines on the current status of this soundcard driver.
Since modularisation there appears to be no single person in charge of
the code. Is Hannu still maintaining something different? 
Also are there any pointers on reverse engineering DOS/Windows drivers?
All I want to be able to do is to use my MIDI keyboard properly - the
last thing I used Windows for until I went 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda'
to recover the space.
