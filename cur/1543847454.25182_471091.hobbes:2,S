I see.  It's irrelevant anyway.

Many SATA controllers emulate TF registers and pass devchk even when no 
device is attached.  I don't know whether the two conditions can happen 
together - 0xFF status is usually seen on PATA.  Anyways, it's more 
reliable to test 0xFF.  Also, that's what driver/ide has been doing for 
a long long time and we don't want to deviate from it if possible.
