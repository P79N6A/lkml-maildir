Excuse me?  I'm not sure how this applies to what I said, but if you want
"permanent" permissions, use devfsd and update your config file with the
new permissions, or chmod the devices in an rc script, or even create the
devices with the right permissions in an rc script (yes, you can use mknod
to your hearts content)

And this is different from using devfsd and changing the devfs config
file HOW?  Please do enlighten me.

A side note, not to you Horst, but to everyone involved in the devfs
thing, advocate or not.. We do need to decide on something, because the
current way of doing things will simply not work in the future, and the
only solution I've seen so far is devfs...  I like devfs just fine, and
I'm at a loss as to other solutions that aren't a complete hack, but I'm
sure the developers would be happy to hear your thoughts, and hey, your
way might end up being the Right Way.
