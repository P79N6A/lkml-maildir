You're right of course. But as i4l has never been able to handle that
case correctly, i4l drivers just don't do short writes, period. They
either return a negative error code, zero to indicate "not ready",
or the requested length. Every i4l driver author learns that very
quickly. (At least I did. ;-)

isdn_write() is the write method of i4l's character device. If a short
write would indeed occur, just passing it on to the caller should be
ok, too. So I'd propose the following, even simpler version:
From: Jesper Juhl <jesper.juhl@gmail.com>
isdn_writebuf_stub() forgets to detect memory allocation and uaccess errors.
And when that's fixed, if a error happens the caller will just keep on
looping.
So change the caller to detect the error, and to return it.
