No dice. My irq's beyond 15 are changed. What used to be 19 became 17, 18 became
16, 17 became 18 and 16 became 19. The others are normal, and while looking at
dmesg, the fixup is still happening. While it boots, and at first glance seems
to work, it hangs hard when I try to use usb. At least the bluetooth dongle,
haven't tried with anything else, but I suppose that'd do the same.
Sorry.
Best regards,
Stian
