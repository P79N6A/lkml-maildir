I think we can safely arrange that if the timer expires, we can be
sure to check the 8042 for an event before synthesising one.

You've mixed the question synthetic UP with software autorepeat.  They
are unrelated, and othogonal.
If you use software autorepeat, you have that problem of runaway
events _anyway_, nothing to do with UP.  And if you don't use software
autorepeat, UP doesn't create a problem.
In fact, the synthetic UP is quite helpful if you miss real events.
For programs which, say, grab the keyboard focus until the user lets
go of a particular key, it is good that the program is eventually sent
an UP.  Otherwise it won't give up the focus at all.  Similarly, in a
game which does something as long as the player holds a key down,
missing the real event results in the game assuming the key is
perpetually held down.

Faulty laptop keyboards.  I get it too, with 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
It's not autorepeat, it's an instant burst of events.
Possibly bad debouncing.
