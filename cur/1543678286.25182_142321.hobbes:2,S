	a) you don't have to have queue per device.  It often does make
sense (for nbd it's almost certainly a win), but it's not required.
	b) you definitely don't have to use separate queue locks.  The
thing will work fine with spinlock being shared and I doubt that there
will be any noticable extra contention.
	c) please, make allocation of queue dynamic _and_ separate from
any other allocated objects.
