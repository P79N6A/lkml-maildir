Thank-you !  I thought it was just me, or something I had set wrong in
'make config' !  Exactly same situation here !  I've reported it to Alan
already, a few days ago.
I've got an Adaptec 2940U (just Ultra, not Ultra/wide)
** Alan **  If you're reading this, here's some additional.  I finally
found time to sit and investigate a little:  It crashes out, just as Allen
says, right after the sda:  without ever showing sda1, etc, with a
'General protection'.  I tracked the EIP (0010:[<00187b91>]
back in the new System.map to the
following:

00185c98 t ide_release
