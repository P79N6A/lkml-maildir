And my 2 pence worth:
I would ask people who do not know all the facts not to comment on this.
Your comments are meaningless or even worse wrong if you are not in

If you have replied to the mails that appeared here, then you are not in
full posession of the facts, and your mail is meaningless.
Thank you.
