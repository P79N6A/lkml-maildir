That I would consider not "one patchkit" personally. And in general people
who have a set of such varying patches don't post [Patch 5/19].... Eg if a
patch makes sense on it's own (and I don't mean just the first
one) I don't think anyone would consider threading it appropriate. The
LTT, ext3, s390, lkcd, ALSA, hotplug (thanks for threading those Gregh!) 
series however are obviously different from that.

It's not to "just" delete them. It's to *GROUP* them properly.
