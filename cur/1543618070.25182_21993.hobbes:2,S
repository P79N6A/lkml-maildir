Hi
Please CC answers to me since I'm not subscribed here.
Since a while now I sometimes get  strange lockups when trying to compile
c++ programms. 
I cannot reproduce it exactly, but on larger c++ apps like Kde or Mozilla, 
the build hangs sooner or later.
I get this behavior with all kernels from  2.4.3  to 2.4.16 (haven't checked 
the newer ones yet)
The problem is that I cannot truely locate, where the error occurs, the logs 
are quite, and the system is truely dead (only HW reset works)
I first suspected my graphics HW (NVIDIA) to be causing the problems, but
the problems remain under Plain console, with no Drivers loaded.
The recent AMD/AGP Bug is also not causing it, I've checked that.
I suppose the Problem is somewhere in the ReiserFs part, since when this hang
happens the last processed c++ file sometimes gets corrupted.
If you need more Info on this please contact me, I'll try to give it then
I Hope someone can help me.
TIA 
Fabio Fracassi
