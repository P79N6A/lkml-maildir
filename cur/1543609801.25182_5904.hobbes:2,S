I made a couple small changes so that it would recognize the MP chipset and not drop to a generic operational mode. The generic mode did not work properly and
would cause occasional system hangs. Fast writes still won't work, but I think a BIOS upgrade might fix that.

I just saw it. I am a registered nVidia developer, but have been too busy with other things (mainly working on the V12 game engine) to look into updating my
actual system software and ping on nVidia about their Linux driver. I asked them once a while back, and they said "A new driver will be released soon, so wait
for that."
I'm getting ready to do it though, since I need to wait for another developer to fix some code (in the game engine) before I can continue.
