    OK. The codes are very self-explanatory XDD Thanks for the
explanation :)

    Not very old, but maybe from a 'difficult time' when the
manufacturer switched from one standard to another. BTW, my entire
Linux box with all my data, fills perfectly in 4GB ;)) Fortunately,
with Linux, you don't need a monster HD for doing everyday job :) Y
use a 40GB main disk drive to store a mirror for my favourite
distros.
    Again, thanks a lot for your explanation :)
