Authentication will be ugly. Joe mounts a filesystem, and does
not bother to authenticate. He gets world-accessible files.
Then Kevin authenticates as himself, and later as db_adm too.
Along comes Sue, who can authenticate the whole box as trusted.
The /fs/ext2 stuff is one of the nastiest hacks I've seen in
a long time, and it doesn't solve the authentication problem.
GUI users might like to see a dialog box pop up whenever they
hit restricted filesystem space. (example: an authentication tool
blocked on /dev/auth-notify or getting signals with info)
