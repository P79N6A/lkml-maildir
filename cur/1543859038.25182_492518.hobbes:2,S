Yes, this works:
|[   27.535937] init IO_APIC IRQs
|[   27.536009]  IO-APIC (apicid-pin) 2-16, 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-21, 2-22, 2-23 not connected.
|[   27.536140] ..TIMER: trying IO-APIC=0 PIN=0 with 8259 IRQ0 disabled<3> (clear_IO_APIC_pin not called)<3> .. failed
|[   27.569357] ..TIMER: trying IO-APIC=0 PIN=0 with 8259 IRQ0 enabled<3> .. works
|[   27.602547] Using local APIC timer interrupts.
I can also report, that updating the BIOS to version 0609 (released
last week or so, also adds the long-missing HPET support) also makes
the problem go away since the first testcase then already works.
I'm currently running with the BIOS downgraded to version 0402.
