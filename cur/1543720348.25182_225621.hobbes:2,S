RTFC... Look carefully in fs/locks.c at stuff like posix_same_owner().
We currently use both the tgid and the struct files_struct (although
there are a few notable bugs where we only check the one or the
other)...
That is, however, a definition which breaks the SUS standards, and it
therefore ends up introducing pathologies such as the steal_locks crap.
struct files_struct is NOT a sane basis for tracking locks.

It is a change in functionality from one where potential deadlocks are
detected and reported as errors to one where deadlocks are suddenly
possible. Are you saying that functionality is not a part of the API?

So how do you define (and detect) a threaded process?
