Wrong.  She needs to compile a new module for her kernel.  What might be
useful is some automagic tool that will find the vendor-provided kernel
source tree and config (which is usually /boot/config-`uname -r`, but
still findable anyhow) and then compile said module for her, toss it
into the modules dir and maybe even add it to the always-loaded module
list (just incase hotplug doesn't grok it).
With some support from people writing external drivers, you could even
have a file that lists things like which files are needed, a URL and
version info, and store it someplace too.
