I had a very similar problem on two of my machines (CPQ laptop and IBM 
NetVista). The beast was completely random and it could have taken from 1 
hour to 48 hours to show up. Also, it seemed to be dependent on modules 
compiled in, even if not used. I couldn't get a decent oops log using NMI, 
serial console, lkcd of kgdb. Symptoms were about the same, there were a 
really short time where the machine was responsive and really sluggish 
(2-5 seconds), then absolute freeze. One time a have been able to get a 
partial SysRq+T, but the partial dump (only three tasks) did not show 
anything abnormal. Now, I cannot say that this is the cause, but building 
with 2.95.3 made my machines stable. But again, the thing was so random 
and so dependent on apparently unrelated things, that I am not sure than 
this is the cure. I was also thinking to be X related, but in my case it 
was not.
