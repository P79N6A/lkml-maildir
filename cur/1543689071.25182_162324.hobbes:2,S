Most changes to the kernel are made without any consideration
of a so-called binary drivers at all. FWIW all drivers are "binary".
If a file is created that was generated for a specific kernel version,
it will work on that kernel version whether or not the driver
sources are available. If the driver does not contain the appropriate
MODULE_LICENSE() string, then several tools will show "tainted" so
that kernel developers will not waste time attempting to find a problem
with a kernel that might be caused by a driver. If the driver has its
source-code released, shown by the appropriate MODULE_LICENSE() string,
then kernel developers may review that driver and fix it if it
is causing a kernel problem.

The current trend is to make all drivers modules. That way, the
kernel will not be bloated with thousands of drivers that are never
used. Basically, the kernel will have just enough hardware-interface
to boot, possibly into a RAM Disk. Then the modules necessary to
support the specific hardware are loaded, the devices initialized
and the boot continues.

There is no such practice going on at this time. A module must
be compiled using the same interface elements (structure members, etc.)
as the kernel. Therefore it must have the same version number, compiled
against the same kernel headers. If the designer of the module can't
make the source code public (usually because of corporate restrictions)
then, if there is a problem that you need to report to the kernel
development group, you need to make sure that the "secret" module
is not installed at that time.  If the secret module is causing
the kernel problem, which is seldom the case BYW, then you need to
contact the provider of the secret module. They may have a brand-
new version that works perfectly.
A case-in-point: A truly MAJOR screen-card developer has not been
allowed to make the source-code publically available because of
corporate restrictions (A publically-owned company might not be
able to make their intellectual property public. This might cause
a stock-holder revolt). This major company has quickly responded
to failures of their modules to work in the latest kernel versions.
The result is that they have a good working relationship, even though
inserting one of their drivers will cause the OPPS reporting software
to declare that the kernel is "tainted".
You don't get a "tainted" message otherwise. You just get good
screen graphics.
