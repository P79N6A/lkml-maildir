Well, actually, with the EEPRO/100, we support more cards than Windows 9x.
At least, if you take the driver straight from Intel and try it. As an
example, the HP3171a network adaptor is an Intel EEPro/100 card. Linux uses
it, NT detects it properly and will use its generic driver, but using the
generic Win95 EEpro driver fails. And it fails badly.

Ewww! Icky.

IIRC, there's also some tweaky PCI breakage with the 905B card. This is one
of the reasons the old model windows drivers don't work with that particular
card, and also why our older drivers don't work with that card.

Oh, nice. I didn't know about that bit of annoyance. Are they deliberately
trying to break Linux, or what?

Well, anyway, there's something flakey about that new card if it works under
a true Intel stock driver but doesn't work under our driver.
