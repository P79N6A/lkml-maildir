I am the APM maintainer (look in the MAINTAINERS file ...) and I did
not post such a patch.  I think it has been posted by two other people
and has been posted at least four times.  Please look in the mailing
list archives.  I have kept a copy for when I get time to look at
it, but finding it is a pain ...
I will have time to work on APM in a couple of weeks (when I change
jobs), so if you all don't mind waiting until then, I may get around
to trying to get Linus/Alan to integrate the real mode power down patch
for those who need it.
Cheers,
Stephen
