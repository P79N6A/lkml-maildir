	I see that on my Linux 2.2.3 kernel, ATI's AGP "Xpert@Play98"
video card goes nuts after printing roughtly the first fifteen lines
of kernel initialization messages.  My kernel was built with
CONFIG_FB enabled and all of the framebuffer drivers built as modules.
This kernel works fine on essentailly all of the other video cards
on which it has run.  When I rebuild the kernel with the generic kernel
frame buffer support deactivated (CONFIG_FB=n), then it works fine.
	I do not believe this is anything new with 2.2.3.  I just
happened to get an Xpert@Play98 today.  This same kernel works fine
on all of the video cards that I have used in the past, so I think
it is some sort of VesaFB bug.
	I may yet track this problem down (although deactivating
CONFIG_FB on x86 is not a big deal), but I thought I ought to report
this now so that people experiencing similar problems can be aware of it.
