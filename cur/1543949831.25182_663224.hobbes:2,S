OK, whatever the guest does should not break the host.  So your patch can't be
the whole solution.

Each pmd is 4 bytes long, so the divide by 4 gives the index into the (top
level) page. ie. a number in the range 0 to 1023.
Indeed, here's the correct fix.  Does it work for you?

Ahmed managed to crash the Host in release_pgd(), which cannot be a Guest
bug, and indeed it wasn't.
The bug was that handing a 0 as the address of the toplevel page table
being manipulated can cause the lookup code in find_pgdir() to return
an uninitialized cache entry (we shadow up to 4 top level page tables
for each Guest).
Commit 37cc8d7f963ba2deec29c9b68716944516a3244f introduced this
behaviour in the Guest, uncovering the bug.
The patch which he submitted (which removed the /4 from the index
calculation) simply ensured that these high-indexed entries hit the
early exit path of guest_set_pmd().  But you get lots of segfaults in
guest userspace as the PMDs aren't being updated.
