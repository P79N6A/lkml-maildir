the original bug report was during module load time, when we're
probing our devices via the pci_driver's probe callback. this is well
before we hook up interrupts or do anything in our closed source code.
I'm attaching a trimmed down version of our driver that pretty much
only does this probe (complete source is included). I don't know if
this will reproduce the original bug or not.
Let me know if I can help anymore.
Thanks,
Terence
