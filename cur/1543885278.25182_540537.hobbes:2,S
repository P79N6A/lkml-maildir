I am using Fedora core 6. I have configured lxr 0.3 with the latest
glimpse but I get the following in the browser:
-> Parent Directory
  -  fileidx
  -  xref
when i click the files it gives me some wierd source code with lots of
funny faces like ones in the ascii command line screens (if that makes
sense at all!).
lxr installprefix is /var/www/lxr/
My document root for apache is /var/www/
attached is my lxr configuration.
