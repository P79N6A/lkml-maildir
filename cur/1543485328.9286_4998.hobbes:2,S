    I cc'ed to util-linux
    1) in case you didn't know that bug, yet
I didnt. Will adapt the man pages for mount and ramdisk
to warn the user never to use the ram disk for anything
important (like temporarily holding data while repartitioning
a disk).
    2) in case mount forgets to report an error from the mount call to the user
       (I think the error is not even seen by mount, so it's not mount's fault)
No, the mount system call succeeds
(even though afterwards there is no msdos filesystem).
This is purely a kernel bug.
    3) to have you see what SCT has in mind as workaround (IOCTL for adjusting
       blocksize and the like)
But it is an internal kernel bug. User space doesnt know about it.
An ioctl cannot help.
(At most it can help in avoiding the problem, just like my solution:
`mount ... -o blocksize=1024' helps in avoiding the problem.)
No, we do not want ioctls. The kernel must be fixed.
