I Guess you're looking for this:

Hi all !
There's a new version of the raidreconf utility out.  I call it 0.0.2.
You can download a patch against the current raidtools at
 
http://ostenfeld.dk/~jakob/Software-RAID.HOWTO/
New features:
*) Bugfix in RAID-0 growth. It now seems to work in all cases with
   strange disk orderings, different disk sizes etc.
*) Added shrinking of RAID-0 arrays.  This also seems to work in all
   cases I have tested.
*) Added ``importing'' of devices. You can convert a single block
   device in to a RAID (hopefully) without loosing your data on the
   block device.

Bye, Martin
