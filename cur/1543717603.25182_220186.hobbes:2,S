Well, I did the breakup in 2 pieces in the first place for 2 reasons:
 - the original patch had some subtle issues with accounting
 - do_mmap_pgoff is already such a mess, let's not make it worse
I mean, it's awful to get anything right in this function, especially
the cleanup/exit path, which is why I think it's more maintainable
cut in 2.
