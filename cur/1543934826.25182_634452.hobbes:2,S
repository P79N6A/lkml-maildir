Greetings;
Is there a utility that can query the motherboard bios and get a list of the 
drives it can see?
Likewise, for the bios extension contained on a pny sata card with a Silicon 
Image chipset on it?
I'm trying to cobble up a way for linux to boot from the drive on this sata 
card, so that the F8 install is completely separated from the FC6 install on 
a pata drive connected to the mainboard.
Thanks.
