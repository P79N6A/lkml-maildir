Solid as a rock, nothing responds anymore. You can sit an elephant on the
keyboard and it won't respond.
Only the big white switch helps (fsck'ing 80 gigs gives me enough time to make
a good cup of coffee... time for ext3 in the main kernel series...)
Have you investigated the problems any further? I mean, does it hang in the
vmware module (probably vmmon as it does not seem to be related to network or
other peripheral activity), or is it somewhere in the main kernel code?
 [ maybe I should give up and just install that kernel debugger... ]
