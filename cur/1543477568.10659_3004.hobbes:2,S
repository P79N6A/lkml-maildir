duh? what files? I'm changing the name of the device.

I did edit /etc/fstab. I even reran lilo, after changing root=.

sorry, no can do. I had the same problem once more, and was dumb enough
to run e2fsck on my hdd. REALLY corrupted everything, so had to reinstall
linux.

yeah. It was.

Yup. Noted cylinder numbers.

I didn't pass out, and you got my idea.

what's a filesystem remapper? and why should I have booted from floppy?
I edited lilo.conf on my hdd and reinstalled lilo.

yeah, I would have thought so too. Both of us were wrong :-(
Anyway, one thing I may have missed is that I didn't unmount everything
before running fdisk. (I couldn't, since my / was one of the partitions
changing, and I needed that to run fdisk in the first place). But nothing
was physically messed, witness the fact that I could remount after
restoring the partition table.
