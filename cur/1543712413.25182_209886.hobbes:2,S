Of course I am, this is what you are proposing as the 'optimal io size'
for SATA. I already explain that ->max_sectors is more of a 'best io
size' not 'hardware limit' setting. So if you set that to 32MB, then
that is what you are indicating.

In that light, I don't think your change makes any sense whatsoever. You
have a different understanding of what max_sectors member does, that's
basically the heart of the discussion.
I don't think it would be too hard to send down a 32MB request if you
just bypass the file system, in fact I would have thought you would have
benched this long before proposing such a modification.
