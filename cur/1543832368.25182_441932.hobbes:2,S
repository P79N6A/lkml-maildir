Please show me how that lock is safe without a compiler memory barrier! What's 
to stop your compiler from moving loads and stores across your inlined lock 
code?
When you add the missing compiler memory barrier, the "volatile" classifier 
becomes unnecessary.
Actually, please just read the thread. We've been over this already. It's 
starting to get really old.
