  CC      kernel/time/clockevents.o
kernel/time/clockevents.c: In function ‘clockevents_set_next_event’:
kernel/time/clockevents.c:519: error: request for member ‘tv_sec’ in something not a structure or union
kernel/time/clockevents.c:519: error: request for member ‘tv_nsec’ in something not a structure or union
make[2]: *** [kernel/time/clockevents.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [kernel/time] Error 2
make: *** [kernel] Error 2
Another ktimer_trace with incorrect arguments AFAICT.
I will try again with -rc5-rt3. :-)

Felix
