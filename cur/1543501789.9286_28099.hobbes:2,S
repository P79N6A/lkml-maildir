Linux already uses more than a C compiler offers. The best answer
would be to merge gcc and g++, using a config file to enable the
features that Linus approves of. Linux could use "C+" then.
This is a nice g++ feature:
A <? B
     is the "minimum", returning the smaller of the numeric
     values A and B.
A >? B
     is the "maximum", returning the larger of the numeric
     values A and B.
Those operators need not have sign-related bugs, eliminating
the objection to (and need for) global min/max macros.
