Not really a Solaris feature. This is a feature of the  Openboot  PROM
which is also used by several other vendors.
The Openboot PROM knows how to write to disk. The same should
apply on Apple hardware and others which use the openboot
convention.
If dumps are enabled (disabled by default in a file read at boot) the
crash() function need only  set a couple of registers and do a prom
interrupt. At this point the kernel is no longer involved so broken
drivers etc are not an issue.
The cute bit is that the SunOS debug program can be called as
debug $DUMPFILE and it takes you to the failure point just like
a tracefile.
Crashdumps should not be enabled by default, they can chew rather
a lot of disk space making a crashdump.datetime file every time
something breaks <B-).
In most cases only developers will use this but it does resolve the
problem of error messages vanishing before they can be saved.
