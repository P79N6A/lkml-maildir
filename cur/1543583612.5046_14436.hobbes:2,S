Be very careful here. He did nothing of the sort. He merely indicated that
there is at least one problem running rsync over ssh between 2.4.1 systems.
There is no guarantee that your problem and his are identical. As Alexey
pointed out, there are bad bugs in 2.2.15 which can cause a TCP connection to
get stuck. Given that you are running 2.2.15, you'd need a tcpdump to
determine whether you hit one of these or not.
I've been bitten too many times assuming something was one big problem only
to find out later it was actually several smaller ones.
