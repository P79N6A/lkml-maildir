Ok that would work for small amounts of cpus. Note that we are moving 
to quad core, many standard enterprise servers already have 8 and will 
likely have 16 next year. Our machine can have thousands of processors 
(new "practical" limit is 4k cpus although we could reach 16k cpus 
easily). I was a bit scared to open that can of worms.
