Again, I think you overstate the problem. "Arbitrarily starved by other 
processes" implies that the process scheduler will do a poor job and 
will allow the slapd process to be starved. We do not assume we're the 
only app on the system, we just assume that eventually we will get the 
CPU back. If that's not a valid assumption, then there is something 
wrong with the underlying system environment.
Something you ought to keep in mind - correctness and compliance are 
well and good, but worthless if the end result isn't useful. Windows NT 
has a POSIX-compliant subsystem but it is utterly useless. That's what 
you wind up with when all you do is conform to the letter of the spec.
