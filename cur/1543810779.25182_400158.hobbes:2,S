Except the above doesn't seem to match reality on anything other than 
SPARC, and the architectures where the shift is 12 anyway because that's 
the only pagesize supported.
On the other hand, sys32_mmap2 on SPARC64 matches the SPARC32 sys_mmap2 
in that the shift is hard-coded to 12:
         .globl          sys32_mmap2
sys32_mmap2:
         sethi           %hi(sys_mmap), %g1
         jmpl            %g1 + %lo(sys_mmap), %g0
          sllx           %o5, 12, %o5
At this point, I'm more than willing to treat SPARC as a special case, 
but I really want to know what the rules actually _ARE_ as opposed to 
what they are supposed to be (which they clearly are not.)
