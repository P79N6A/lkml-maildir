I was concerned about that as well back when I was getting the
instrumentation functional on the pxa270 as the rollover could
be as short as ~8s which wasn't really long enough for test
validation.  However there is a /64 prescaler on that ARM core
(and others) which can function as a bandaid and extend the range
to ~8minutes.
I wasn't able to convince myself in a quick read of the code if
roll over was being detected/corrected (though it certainly may).
But even if not the only requirement needed to do so would be to
assure any two consecutive data points logged per CPU were spaced
apart less than the counter's wrap interval.  Given the periodic
events being logged in the normal course of operation this condition
would certainly be met.
