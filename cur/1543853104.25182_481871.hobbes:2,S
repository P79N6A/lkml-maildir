Hi Andi,
This code (verify_cpu) is called while we are still in real mode. So it has
to be present in low 1MB. Now in trampoline has been designed to switch to
64bit mode and then jump to the kernel hence kernel can be loaded anywhere
even beyond (4G). So if we move this code into say arch/x86_64/kernel/head.S
then we can't even call it.
So I think we got to leave it in trampoline only.
Thanks
Vivek
