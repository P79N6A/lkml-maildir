Thanks. You are right, the readahead logic won't affect the swap cache.
Nor will the readahead size, I guess. But to be sure, you can do one
more test on it with the following command, using the same 2.5.17-mm5:
        blockdev --setra /dev/hda1 256
Please replace /dev/hda1 with the root device on your system, thanks.
