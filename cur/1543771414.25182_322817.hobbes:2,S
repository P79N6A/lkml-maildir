hm.  Under what circumstances do you expect this test to trigger?
We have the in_atomic() test in x86's do_page_fault() because as a
super-special case, kmap_atomic() will increment preempt_count() even if
!CONFIG_PREEMPT.  This is how x86 handles faults during
pagecache<->userspace copies into a kmap_atomically-mapped page.  s390
doesn't do any of that.
So.  What's going on in here?

Comment needs updating...
