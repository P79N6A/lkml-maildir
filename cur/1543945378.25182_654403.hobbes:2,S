It is already "in", it just hasn't percolated up to Linus' tree yet.  In 
the past I've always dealt with similar issues by just waiting until 
the patch I need has hit Linus' tree then submitted my patch.  If you 
can't wait, you can always rebase your patch against the net-2.6 tree 
(should be no work at all) and if DaveM doesn't have a problem pulling 
your patch into the net-2.6 tree you can always send it up that way.
