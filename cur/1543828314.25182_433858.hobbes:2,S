sh: line 0: echo: write error: Invalid argument
because "disabled" is apparently spelled right, this means it bails out at
        if (!device_can_wakeup(dev))
                return -EINVAL;
which is also confirmed by the fact that reading it returns nothing.

Unfortunately one of them does not work and another is not really feasible :( 
I guess I run 2.6.16 for a while :)
