Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI patches for 2.6.24-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here are a some PCI patches against your 2.6.24-rc1 git tree.
They are a bunch of quirk updates from David Miller, a new config item
to help Jeff Garzik start to cleanup the isdn drivers and let him take
those patches through his tree, and a few other minor bugfixes.
All of these have been in the -mm tree for a while.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
