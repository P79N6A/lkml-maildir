Subject: [patch] IRQ_INPROGRESS bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The i386 port had a bug in the IRQ_INPROGRESS flag handling. It was
setting the flag even if there was no action and so even if the irq
handler would be no executed and so even if the IRQ_INPROGRESS flag will
remain set forever.
The bug seen the light after the pre-2.1.132-4 irq.c changes in
enable_irq() that doesn't unset the INPROGRESS flag anymore. This is
obviously a right change since the only piece of code that make sense to
play with INPROGRESS is the code in the irq context path (and the irq probing
of course ;).
The bug was causing my ethernet card to lose the network doing simply a
ping flood. The reason of the network-lose was that the irq was been
disabled by the ethernet 8390 driver in a critical section of
ei_start_xmit(). While the irq was disabled the irq happened and so it 
bogus setted the IRQ_INPROGRESS flag forever. This way no other ethernet
irq had a chance to run anymore.
The IRQ_INPROGRESS flag has to be set also when we are probing for irqs
and the patch takes care of that. There was an issue also about the IRQ_PENDING
flag, now I set it only if the irq is disabled or if the irq is in progress,
this is the right thing to do according to me.
Here the fix against pre-2.1.132-4, as usual I don' t know nothing about
Copyright issues...
