Hi linux hackers ...
I'd like to know, if there's a way to get the ammount of time wasted by a
process, while it was making i/o. I've seen that the rusage
makes available the ammount of i/o blocks, but I'm thinking in something
like:
          process warawara ...
          time wasted in disks i/o .... XXX
          time wasted in net i/o   .... XXX
          etc. ???
Doest it makes sense? it could be done in linux?
I supposed ,that I can insert some system calls in the right places
in the program to make this... but I'm interested in a non-intrusive
method ...
Thanks in advance
saludos
