Hello all,
  I am trying to de-activate the TCP checksumming and allow hardware (GBE to 
compute it for me). But can any one let me know how to do it.
This is what I did.But Its not working for me.
In linux/net/ipv4/tcp.c there are function calls to 
csum_and_copy_from_user(). I replaced it from copy_from_user() and set the 
skb->ip_summed = CHECKSUM_HW and skb->csum = 1;. Is this correct. Since its 
not working there must be something more that has to be done. could any one 
please tell me what additional thinks I need to do.
All suggestion are highly apperciated.
Thanking You
Shesha
