Wow.. same deal here -- sequential throughput drops from 40MB/sec to 28MB/sec
with CFQ -- whereas the anticipatory scheduler maintains the 40MB/sec.
Jens.. I wonder if the new merging test is a bit too strict?
There are four possible combinations, and the new code
allows merging for two of them:  sync+sync and async+async.
But surely one of (not sure which) sync+async or async+sync may also be okay?
Or would it?
This is a huge performance hit.
Cheers
