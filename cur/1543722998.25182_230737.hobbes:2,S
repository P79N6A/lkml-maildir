Subject: [ANNOUNCE] HYADES (ITEA) project -- Adeos/ia64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

At 
http://www.hyades-itea.org
 you will find a port of Adeos for Linux
2.6 to the ia64/SMP architecture, currently running on Bull's
Novascale systems.
The main objective of the EU-funded (ITEA) HYADES project is to adapt
standard technologies for applications that require real-time
response, associated with heavy, parallel computations.
HYADES is a partnership led by the Thales Group, composed of various
organizations interested in deterministic intensive computing on the
Linux/ia64 platform, among which are Bull, MandrakeSoft and Dolphin.
The contribution of the HYADES project to the community will extend
beyond the port of Adeos, by adapting the RTAI/fusion experimental
technology to fit their needs on the ia64/SMP architecture.
The Adeos/ia64 patch and others can also be found at the usual place:

Enjoy,

Philippe.
