2.3.9 works with software raid-0, this fails in 2.3.10
I have two scsi drives connected to an adaptec 2940, combining
/dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 into /dev/md0
Booting 2.3.10 seems to create the array, cat /proc/mdstat
shows md0 created from sda1+sdb1, but inactive.  
mdrun -a says "invalid parameter /dev/md0" and trying
to mount /dev/md0 says "access beyond end of device, 
it might be a zero-length partition."
The array works fine with 2.3.9 and earlier kernels.
