After the sync, along with the freezing of kernel threads.

If the work queues are frozen, there won't be any fs-related activity _after_
we create the suspend image.  The sync is done after the userland has been
frozen, so if the resume is unsuccessful, we'll be able to recover the state
of the fs right before the sync, and if the resume is successful, we'll be
able to continue (the state of memory will be the same as before the creation
of the suspend image and the state of the disk will be the same as before the
creation of the suspend image).
