Well, don't get your hopes up too much...  ia64 uses the same addresses
early and late, i.e., if 8250_pci discovers a PIO port, the early code
also uses a PIO address.  We never use an MMIO address early and a PIO
address later.
The PIO -> MMIO translation is hidden inside our inb/outb functions
(see __ia64_mk_io_addr()).  The firmware tells us where the legacy
0-64K I/O ports are mapped, so we can set up io_space[0].mmio_base
very early, without enumerating the PCI bridges.
