Just one. Don't most of the inode->i_op->truncate() methods on local
filesystems call mark_inode_dirty()?
If so, then the call at the end of inode_setattr() will be superfluous
for the case where ia_valid==ATTR_SIZE, since vmtruncate() will dirty
the inode for us.
Otherwise, this patch looks great!
