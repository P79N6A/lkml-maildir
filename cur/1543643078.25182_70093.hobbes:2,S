That doesn't make the DoS go away, it just makes it a little
harder to trigger.  Anyway, one thing we could do if the rest
of the module mechanism is up to it, is know that somebody is
trying to reactivate a module that has just returned from
module_cleanup(), and immediately reactivate it instead of
freeing it, hoping to save some disk activity - if this turns
out to be a real problem, that is.  The null solution is likely
the winner here.

Goodness no.  By the way, nobody has asked me how rmmod -a is
to be implemented.  Oh well.
