Yes, I have CONFIG_ISA=y.  I put my kernel config at
http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~lipeng/x31info/config.txt
The only thing I noticed is that in the dmesg, there is a error
message:
   PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 0000:02:00.0
But this message is still there when I unplugged the RAM and the card
is working fine.  
For the kernel, what is the difference between these two situations?
*   1GB RAM, boot with mem=512M
* 512MB RAM, normal boot 
It is not likely to be a hardware issue, since the card works fine with
1GB of memory in Windows XP.
