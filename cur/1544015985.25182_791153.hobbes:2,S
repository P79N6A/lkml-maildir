This sounds like a problem with speculative allocation - delayed allocations
beyond eof.  Even if we write a small file, say 4k, a 64k chunk of delayed
allocation will be credited to the file.  If we extend the file we use more
of that chunk instead of allocating more.  When the file is closed and the
last inode reference is dropped the excess delayed allocations are released
back to freespace - this must be happening during the sync.
