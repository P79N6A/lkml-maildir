I'm pretty sure you're not the only one, I have had my CD/DVD drive *obsessively*
try to read from a bad CD/DVD (or just a badly scrached area on the disc),
bringing the system to an unusable state and not even stopping in reasonable time
(minutes, at least), I was forced to power cycle the laptop in all of these cases.
