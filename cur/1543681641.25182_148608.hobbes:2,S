Hi,
Tried to find information about a kernel OOPS I've seen a lot of times 
already on 4 different machines - but nothing seems to be said about this in 
the list archives or anywhere else for that matter.
We are running 2.4.18-24 on SMP machines with 2CPUs and hyperthreading 
(SuperMicro Xeon servers) and doing heavy IO to disk and networking. (Qlogic 
HBAs and Intel e1000 NICs are used)
At some point the machine oopses (no scenario except heavy nfs-server like 
load):
The oops doesn't appear in logs or on the console, but I've been able to use 
the diagnostic keys to get the following information:
right ALT+Scroll lock
CPU 0 : swapper
[<c0106f32>] (0xc0323fc4))  default_idle
[<c0105000>] (0xc0323fd4)) empty_zero_page
CPU 1 : swapper
(<c0106f32>)  (0xc 6597fb0)     - default_idle
(<c011d29b>) (0xc 6597fd0)    - out_of_line_bug
(<c011d449>) (8xc 659ffc)        - printk
CPU 3 : swapper
[<c0106f32>] (0xc8257fb0))  default_idle
[<c011d449>][0xc8257fd0)) printk
CTRL +Scroll lock

[<c011c47a>]do_fork
[<c0107718>]dump_thread
[<c0108ccf>]sys_sigaltstack
After the oops networking stack continues to function, some running daemons 
continue to work (I'm seeing network traffic from the machine which 
indicates that clearly), but login into the node is not possible via 
console, ssh, rsh, and the majority of the application processes are dead.
Any information / pointers will be appreciated.
If any information is missing or anything I should do to help analyze next 
time it happens tell me as well.
Thanks,
