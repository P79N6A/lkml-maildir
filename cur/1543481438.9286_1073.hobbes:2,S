	I too like skip-list, the avg cost per ptr is low and things like
merges are very easy, but when raw perf. is an issue a good RBtree impl
usually kills a skip-list. I have and use both, but skip-list is almost
never a better solution than an RBtree.
	Even pre-caching the random numbers before a benchmark and pulling
them from a pool doesn't give skip-list an advantage, I don't see how this
would be any better in the kernel.
