Hello
What ist the best way to wait n*10ms in a kernel thread? I am porting a non
linux device driver to linux. The main part of the driver sould not be 
changed. The driver needs 2 kernel threads. The threads are soft realtime
threads. They call a wait function if they want to sleep. In the moment 
I use this to implement the wait function:
void wait_func(int t)
{
	unsigned long j;
	j=jiffies+t*HZ/100;
	while(jiffies<j)
		schedule();
}
It works but the Idle task has no chance. So what can I do?
Knud
