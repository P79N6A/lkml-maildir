Just a note ... I don't think minimum system requirements indicate a
software DSP on PCI as the minimum is now something that comes with a PCI
bus and an OS that can handle such a non standard com port.
I wish the industry would standardise a way to tell the diffrence by
looking at the box.  Considering that the winmodem makers wouldn't mark
their product willingly, perhapse somone could persuade the manufacturers
of real modems to mark it with "ON BOARD DSP" as a selling feature.

PS I would really like to know if you can get that modem working as the
modem is the last thing I need ISA for.
