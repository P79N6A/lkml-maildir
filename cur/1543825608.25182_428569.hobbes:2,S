It's both a timer handler and a poll_controller handler:
- if the interrupt handler causes a system overload (gig e without irq 
mitigation...), then the nic disables the irq on the device and waits 
one tick and handles the interrupts from a timer. This is nv_do_nic_poll().
- nv_do_nic_poll is also called from the poll_controller handler.
I'll try to remove the disable_irq() calls from the poll_controller 
handler, but probably not before the week-end.
