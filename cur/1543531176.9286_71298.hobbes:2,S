Really, I have no arguments here.
I believe in a combined approach towards adopting the standard Linux
into 
embedded systems :
1. if a timing problem can be fixed at no or minimal cost for both
   desktop systems and embedded systems, fix it in the main branch.
2. if a timing problem must be fixed for embedded systems, but may not
   be beneficial to desktop systems, document the knowledge and maintain
   patches (tedious work, but you get other benefits for using Linux)
3. if there is no good fix, document the knowledge and avoid the timing
problem
   in application/system level.  (Or you can use RTLinux. :-))
The lost need_resched flag to me falls into 1).
