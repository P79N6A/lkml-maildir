the processor has 100 MB FSB
The memory is PC133, 1 DIMM of 128 MB

well... i would't name a Celeron 900 MHz crippled. PC133 is the best the
board gets... and now the speed is lower then the previous server which was

couldn't find any BIOS setting for that. where should it be ?

the machine is (should be)  a NFS server, I couldn't care less about the
