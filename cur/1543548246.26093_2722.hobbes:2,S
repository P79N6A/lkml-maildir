It is still possible with current kernels. As Jamie pointed out, just use
noflushd, available from every debian mirror in the woody tree, or from
http://www.tuebingen.linux.de/~s-kod1/noflushd/.
 This will provide you
with the same functionality as the mobile bdflush or update versions on
earlier kernels. 
Still the other proposals regarding noatime or upping the limits on
bdflush params make sense and can be used orthogonal to or without
noflushd. But note that there's an entirely user-level solution
without the need to hack the kernel.
Daniel.
