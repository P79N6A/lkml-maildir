   I've need some additional serial ports on my laptop
   for some time and have finally found an available PCMCIA serial device.
   However it is based on the 16C950 UART and ideally I'd like to 
   use it with 2.2.
   The UART datasheets claim it is compatible with the 16750 which 
   serial.c(v4.27) claims it supports, and 2.4's serial.c(v5.01) claims
   support for the 16950.
A 16C950 UART is backwards compatible with a 16550A UART.  Hence, you
can use a 16C950 UART with a 2.2 kernel; it won't take full advantage of
the larger transmit FIFO size (for example), or some of the more
advanced features of the 16C950, but it will work just fine on a 2.2
system.  So you don't have to take the bleading edge kernels just for
this reason.
