Me too, but if it's between having a comment or the long version of the 
code with the if() wrapped around it, then I'll personally take the 
comment.  But the actual code should be comment enough.

I haven't actually measured it, but that would be my guess from looking at 
the actual code gcc generates.
security/selinux/ss/conditional.c::cond_policydb_destroy() for instance :
The original version with the if() in place :
void cond_policydb_destroy(struct policydb *p)
{
        if (p->bool_val_to_struct)
                kfree(p->bool_val_to_struct);
        avtab_destroy(&p->te_cond_avtab);
        cond_list_destroy(p->cond_list);
}
turns out like this :
juhl@dragon:~/download/kernel/linux-2.6.11-mm4$ objdump -d -S 
security/selinux/ss/conditional.o

First of all that's significantly shorter, so we'll gain a bit of memory 
and I'd guess it would improve cache behaviour as well (but I don't know 
enough to say for sure).
I'm also assuming that in the vast majority of cases (not just here, 
but all over the kernel) the pointer being tested will end up being !=NULL 
so we'll end up doing the function call in any case, so saving the 
conditional should be an overall win.
