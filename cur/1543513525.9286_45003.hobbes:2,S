No it's not, disconnect/reconnect is a feature that both ATA and SCSI support
these days. SCSI has always had this but ATA has only had this feature since
the introduction of ATAPI. TCQ is a not a new feature to SCSI but command
queueing is supported by ATA-66 devices (or at least can be).
As far as kernel support for this, I don't know.
