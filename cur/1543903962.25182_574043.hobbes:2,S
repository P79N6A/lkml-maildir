<nods> Yes, keeping patches from crufting up and stepping on other
patches' toes is hard work; I did it for a bit, and it was one of the
more thankless tasks I've tried a hand at.
So, thanks.

Well, I suspect it's 'lifetime of the feature,' in this case as it's
no more user visible than the page replacement algorithm in the first
place.

In some cases, it almost certainly is. It also has the troubling
aspect of mitigating future regressions without anyone terribly
noticing, due to it being able to paper over those hypothetical future
deficiencies when they're introduced.

I spend a lot of time each day watching my computer fault my
workingset back in when I switch contexts. I'd rather I didn't have to
do that. Unfortunately, that's a pretty subjective problem report. For
whatever it's worth, we have pretty subjective solution reports
pointing to swap prefetch as providing a fix for them.
My concern is that a subjective problem report may not be good enough.
So, what do I measure to make this an objective problem report? And if
I do that (and it shows a positive result), will that be good enough
to argue for inclusion?
