    So, opening the node and checking for ENOMEDIUM is the only
solution... Polling looks like a waste of time, and given that I use the
reader once a month or so, HAL will be a waste of resources. I'll resort
to manually do "hdparm -z" (or something similar) when I need to insert
or remove a card.
    Thanks for confirming, Kay :))
