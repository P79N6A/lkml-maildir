sorry but I'm not sure to understand you...Do you mean that the first write
into reg_a pointer will be completed before the second write because they're
separated by a (;) ?
Or because writes are encapsulated inside an inline function, therefore
compiler
must execute every single writes before returning from the inline function ?
Thanks.
