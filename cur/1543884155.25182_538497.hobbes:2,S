Sparse has a warning -Wptr-subtraction-blows (off by default) which generates
a warning for any pointer subtractions.  This warning relates to GCC
shortcomings observed in 2005; the original log message:

Does this still apply?  Do current versions of GCC still have this problem?
If not, can the option and warning go away?
