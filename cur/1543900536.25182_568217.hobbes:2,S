Yes. NFS on top of XFS on top of DM/MD.
XFS got some fixes recently, of which the main one was to fix the
regressions that gcc 4.x introduced by inlining single use functions
that we'd split out of the common code to reduce stack usage. So in
reality, there hasn't been a great deal of change in the status quo
here.
In fact, things have probably got worse because the generic
writeback code is slowly increasing it's stack usage....
Cheers,
Dave.
