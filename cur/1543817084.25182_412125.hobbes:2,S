I think what we really want are stacked security modules.
I have not yet fully digested all of the requirements for multiple servers
on the same machine but increasingly the security aspects look
like a job for a security module.
Enforcing policies like container A cannot send signals to processes
in container B or something like that.
Then inside of each container we could have the code that implements
a containers internal security policy.
At least one implementation Linux Jails by Serge E. Hallyn was done completely
with security modules, and the code was pretty minimal.
