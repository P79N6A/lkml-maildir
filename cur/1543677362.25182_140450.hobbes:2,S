why not have a performance option that is a tradeoff between optimum

unless i misunderstand the problem, you can certainly pad the TCP options 
with NOPs ...

another option is for the write() path is for instantant-send TCP sockets 
to delay the copy_from_user() until the IP+TCP header size is known.
