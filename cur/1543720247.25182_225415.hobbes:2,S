Not just packet_recvmsg() (frankly, I'm stumped how tcpdump is working
on my sparc64 boxes due to this bug!), every other sendmsg/recvmsg
implementation has a test like this verifying the msg_flags for bogons.
Let's ask a better question, why do we need to pass this thing down
into the implementations anyways?
I can't see a reason, can anyone else?  If there is no reason, the
right fix is simply to mask it out at the top level, for both
sendmsg and recvmsg.
