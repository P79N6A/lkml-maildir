They are "user-mode" only in theory.
They are really kernel instructions set up by the kernel, and user-mode 
only in the sense that yes, they run in ring3. No actual user-compiled 
code executed anywhere.
At least to me, that vsyscall trampoline is all kernel code. But yes,
you're right, we no longer do the eflags save/restore in user mode, that
was too slow (some of my first versions just cleared TF unconditionally,
and the trampoline was responsible for re-enabling it).

I was talking about the vsyscall code.
