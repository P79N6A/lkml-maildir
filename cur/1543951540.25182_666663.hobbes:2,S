It's standard on the analogue side of audio codecs, for example.

What do you see as being missing in the externally presented interface?
As far as I can see the main difference between the two APIs on this
front is that the regulator API explicitly separates the interface used
to set up the tree from the interface used by consumers.

Not as part of this API at present unless the input is another
regulator, though obviously drivers could set up associations in the
device tree.

Right, though that does tend to break down when clocks go off chip - the
association of devices with symbolic names is generally only done for
things that are hard wired as part of the same chip since the devices
are registered along with the clock.   Other clocks generally just get
the name that the chip documents for them.  Indeed, looking around the
tree almost all current use of clock API appears to be for on-SoC devices.
Unless I'm missing something the obvious way to provide off-chip
symbolic names in the clock API is for board code to register a virtual
clock with the desired name and device and parent it off the actual
clock source.  That said I can't immediately find any actual uses of that
and at least some of the implementations I've seen wouldn't support it.
A similar approach should work here, though I'm not sure it's terribly
nice.
What might be nicer would be an API that platform code could use to map
regulators to device/name tuples.  The core could then search these when
a client calls regulator_get() (either by maintaining a separate table
or by setting up virtual regulators).

I don't see a particular problem fitting this into the structure of
the current API - to me the switches inflexible regulators with no
configurable voltage control of their own.  The core would need to be
enhanced a bit to cope with passing through the configurability of the
parent regulator when a child has no get/set operations of its own but
that doesn't need to be visible to anything except the non-configurable
regulators.
