 Can you append the new fields at real end of records? Now you have
 the new fields between "options" and "freq, passno".
 (BTW, maybe we can completely remove "freq, passno" from
 /proc/mounts, especially if we don't have care about compatibility
 with /etc/{mtab,fstab} format. The freq and passno are always zero in
 /proc/mounts).

 Do we really need a "<name>=" (mntid=, fsid=, parent=) prefixes? I
 think your new fields are always in the same column (on same
 position).

 You needn't "peer" or "master" keywords and it would be nice
 to use one column for all propagation flags (separated by comma).
    <FLAG>[:id>][,...]
 for example:
   SHARED:c1f08c28,SLAVE:c1e08cb0
 Full example:
 <fsname> <dir> <type> <opts> <freq> <passno> \
           <propflags> <mntid> <fsid> <parentid>
 rootfs / rootfs rw  0 0 PRIVATE c1708c30 1:/ c1708c30
 /dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0 PRIVATE 1208c08 6200:/ c1708c30
 /proc /proc proc rw  0 0 UNBINDABLE c1108c90 3:/ c1208c08
 devpts /dev/pts devpts rw  0 0 PRIVATE c1108c18 a:/ c1208c08
 /dev/root /mnt ext2 rw 0 0 SHARED:c1e08cb0 c1e08cb0 6200:/mnt c1208c08
 /dev/root /var ext2 rw 0 0 SHARED:c1f08c28,SLAVE:c1e08cb0 c1f08c28 6200:/mnt/1 c1208c08
