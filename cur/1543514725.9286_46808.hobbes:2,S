Al Viro,
It's not a religious issue, but a technical one.  We have a cross
platform file system that supports Linux and many other OS's.  Linux
should be on par with everyone else.  I develop on Windows 2000 IFS and
BSD and BEOS and Netware.  Linux is the toughest one for supporting
mirroring so far becuase the buffer cache design is inflexible.  Just
trying to bring my experience with doing this on all the other OS's to
bear on Linux.  Linux should be just as good -- lighting some fires on
these issues is a good thing.
