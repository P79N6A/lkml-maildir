On two systems (Laptop and Pentium 60) I've
Installed RedHat 6.2
Compiled 2.4.0-test8 (make menuconfig _no changes_)
installed (lilo)
On the P60 it freezes with after the message
"Uncompressing Linux.... Ok, booting the kernel"
The P60 is eisa based and dates back from 1993. I can send more info on 
the machine tonight if needed.
