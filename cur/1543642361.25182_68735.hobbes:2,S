This sounds like a vsyscall.  Since we have discussed vsyscalls on and
off without getting anywhere, I'd like to know how your implementation
does it -- the #1 proposal I think was to map in a page at 0xfffff000
and have the vsyscall code there.
Note that the vsyscall needs to bounce to a regular syscall if TSC
time/gettimeofday aren't available.
