Please point me to where it says I cannot load proprietary modules in
the Kernel.

I know his opinion. I don't debate his opinion. It is his code. I
choose not to use his code because of the license issue.

No, just that the trend is disturbing. If enough Kernel Developers
choose to write their Software in a way that prevents others from
using it freely, then that is troubling. Especially when these Kernel
Developers are substituting existing interfaces in the Kernel with
ones that are NEW and require specific licenses.
