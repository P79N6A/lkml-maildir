No, 40GB Maxtor, VT133A chipset. This box has experienced -zero- filesystem 
corruption since it was purchased, up until I tried the directory index 
patch. And even then, it only shows up with the dir_index flag set.
OTOH, much of this corruption could be because journal replay doesn't seem to 
be happening after a filesystem is remounted read-only due to errors. That 
would certainly leave the filesystem in an inconsistant state.
