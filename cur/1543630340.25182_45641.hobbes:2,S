Ahh, its great that someone is doing reviews of our code.

The iucv stuff in VM is a bit asymmetric ...

The intention of this is to have fsm.o built as a module if ctc
and iucv are built as modules too. I agree that this is broken
if one of {iucv,ctc} is built as a module and the other is built
in.

The rest is missing because we are waiting for the legal ok.
That the config.in contains these two lines is a mistake of mine.

I sent the patch together with the lcs driver to Marcelo last
week but I haven't heard of him yet. Wait and see ?
