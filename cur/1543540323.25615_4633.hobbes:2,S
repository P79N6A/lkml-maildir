Umhm... Moreover, some of us have been using UNIX for years and had been
burnt more than once by, should we say it, differences in mount behaviour/
system policies/cleanup scripts/etc. and had learned _hard_ way that blind

tapes.
Oh, well, blind overmount goes out. Without an explicit option mounting
over existing mountpoint should fail.
