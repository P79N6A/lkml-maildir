In response to Randy's and your questions, here's what I understand:
The error message comes from parport_pc_write_control in
include/linux/parport_pc.h, which is called by bw-qcam's
write_lpcontrol():
static __inline__ void parport_pc_write_control (struct parport *p,
                         unsigned char d)
{
    const unsigned char wm = (PARPORT_CONTROL_STROBE |
                  PARPORT_CONTROL_AUTOFD |
                  PARPORT_CONTROL_INIT |
                  PARPORT_CONTROL_SELECT);
    /* Take this out when drivers have adapted to newer interface. */
    if (d & 0x20) {
        printk (KERN_DEBUG "%s (%s): use data_reverse for this!\n",
            p->name, p->cad->name);
        parport_pc_data_reverse (p);
    }
    __parport_pc_frob_control (p, wm, d & wm);
}
The mask wm works out to 0x0f, so first it calls
parport_pc_data_reverse(), then masks off the high nibble with the
reverse flag and makes the regular call.
Looking at that more carefully, I'm not sure whether I need to add the
write_lpcontrol(q, 0) after the first call. Other than that, I believe
I'm following the same procedure.
As for whether data_reverse is sticky, I don't know... I'll see what I
can find out.
