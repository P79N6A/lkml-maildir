No, but it is the best possible approximation to a stable numbering.
For most people (who do not have both solaris and unixware, compiling
even kernels with solaris support and odd kernels with unixware support)
the right order suffices to eliminate all problems.
The problem is independent of naming - there is a tree-structured space
here, and the kernel has to flatten it, assigning minor numbers.
In user space it is easy to populate /dev/unixware with device nodes
p1, p2, ... that are symlinks to /dev/hda12, /dev/hda13, ...
(or use mount by label or uuid).
