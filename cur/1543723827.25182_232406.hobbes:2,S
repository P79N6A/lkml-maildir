Userland has to place arguments where the kernel expects them. Have a
look at ./linux/asm-$ARCH/unistd.h to see how syscalls can be made. You
can think of the _syscallX() macros as the lowest-level "function" to
get access to a system call slot. From there, the syscall is usually
dispatched from entry.S.
Syscalls trigger some kind of interrupt or exception; an exception
handler then gets the system call number and dispatches it through the
syscall function pointer's addresses in sys_call_table (in entry.S).
