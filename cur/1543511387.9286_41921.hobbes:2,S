Hi!
Here's my port of kdb to 2.3.18. It is nt diffed against clean, it is
diff against my own version, but you should be able to make it work
with minimal work.
Scott Lurndal, whereever you are, please put your email address into
patch.
Anyway, here it is. Feel free to make it nicer.
								Pavel
PS: It would be nice to provide hooks into standard kernel, and
distribute only arch/i386/kdb separately. Changes are minimal.
