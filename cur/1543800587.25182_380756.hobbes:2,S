Hi
Have included a patch fix for the x25 module in the latest stable
version of the kernel. 
Problem:
When a user-space server application calls bind on a socket, then
in kernel space this bound socket is considered 'x25-linked' and the 
SOCK_ZAPPED flag is unset.(As in x25_bind()/af_x25.c).
Now when a user-space client application attempts to connect to the
server on the listening socket, if the kernel accepts this in-coming
call, then it returns a new socket to userland and attempts to reply to
the caller.  
The reply/x25_sendmsg() will fail, because the new socket created on
call-accept has its SOCK_ZAPPED flag set by x25_make_new().
(sock_init_data() called by x25_alloc_socket() called by x25_make_new()
sets the flag to SOCK_ZAPPED)).
Fix:
Using the sock_copy_flag() routine available in sock.h fixes this. 
Tested on 32 and 64 bit kernels with x25 over tcp. 
I hope this fix can be applied to the next release of the kernel.
Many Thanks
Shaun
