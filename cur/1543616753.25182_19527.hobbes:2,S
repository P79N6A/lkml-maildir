the user asked for VM_LOCKED vma, if he asks for that and he faults too
low on the stack with big holes in between that's his mistake. And
anyways ptrace just faults in all the intermediate pages just now, so
it is definitely possible (we provide different userspace API from
ptrace/map_user_kiobuf and page-fault at the moment).

the only case here is when the app knows how much stack it will need to
use, without faulting in the holes, it will have to memset the whole
region of stack the it wants to be atomic. If instead the kernel also
fault-in the holes (like map_user_kiobuf/ptrace/get_user_pages just does
in 2.4) the app will only need to touch the lowest virtual address of
stack it needs as atomic.
I don't see any real problem either ways, it must be simply a well
defined API.
Then the user will know if he can touch one byte and the kernel fills
the holes automatically, or if he has to do the whole memset.
