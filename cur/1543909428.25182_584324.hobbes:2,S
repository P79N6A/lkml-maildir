Subject: [RFC 2/3] Use NOMEMALLOC reclaim to allow reclaim if PF_MEMALLOC is set
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/14/177

If we exhaust the reserves in the page allocator when PF_MEMALLOC is set
then no longer give up but call into reclaim with PF_MEMALLOC set.
This is in essence a recursive call back into page reclaim with another
page flag (__GFP_NOMEMALLOC) set. The recursion is bounded since potential
allocations with __PF_NOMEMALLOC set will not enter that branch again.
This means that allocation under PF_MEMALLOC will no longer run out of
memory. Allocations under PF_MEMALLOC will do a limited form of reclaim
instead.
The reclaim is of particular important to stacked filesystems that may
do a lot of allocations in the write path. Reclaim will be working
as long as there are clean file backed pages to reclaim.
