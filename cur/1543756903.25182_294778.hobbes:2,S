Subject: [PATCH] Build failure with !CONFIG_PCI and with CONFIG_ISAPNP=y && CONFIG_PNPBIOS=y

Trying to build latest kernel with !CONFIG_PCI and with
CONFIG_ISAPNP=y && CONFIG_PNPBIOS=y
I got the following build error:
  LD	vmlinux
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x5486): In function
'pnpbios_parse_allocated_irqresource':
: undefined reference to 'pcibios_penalize_isa_irq'
Clearly pcibios_penalize_isa_irq() is meant to be called only with
CONFIG_PCI, so
following patch suggests itself:

 #include "pnpbios.h"
By the way, while using cscope I noticed that there is very bogus looking
definition of pcibios_penalize_isa_irq() in line 24 of arch/i386/pci/visws.c,
but as that is not called anywhere in that file it could be simply removed.
No patch for that though because I could not get the file to compile.
