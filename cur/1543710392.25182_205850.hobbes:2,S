Hello everybody!
My machine gives me for
	$ cat /proc/iomem
	00000000-0009fbff : System RAM
	0009fc00-0009ffff : reserved
	000a0000-000bffff : Video RAM area
	000c0000-000c7fff : Video ROM
	000d0000-000d9fff : Extension ROM
	000f0000-000fffff : System ROM
	00100000-0f7dffff : System RAM
	  00100000-0022ca51 : Kernel code
	  0022ca52-0029d8e3 : Kernel data
	0f7e0000-0f7e7fff : ACPI Tables
	0f7e8000-0f7fffff : ACPI Non-volatile Storage
	80100000-801fffff : PCI Bus #01
	  80100000-8011ffff : Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS630 GUI
and so on.
Now I can access the whole area below the ACPI tables (I tried RAM, video and 
system ROM, and kernel code/data).
But on reaching the ACPI tables and above (PCI space and so on) I get no data 
(that is, vche blanks the screen).
I'd expect that for the PCI space - as this is really IO-memory and shouldn't 
be messed with.
But I'd like to access the ACPI tables; especially the NVRAM, as some machines 
store DMI data there.
This is on 
	Linux version 2.4.24-1-686 (herbert@gondolin) (gcc version 3.3.2 (Debian))
and an old 2.4.19 kernel.
Any tips? Help for accessing this memory space?
Regards,
Phil
