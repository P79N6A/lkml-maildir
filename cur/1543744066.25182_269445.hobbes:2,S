Hi,
Periodically, especially while playing large files with Xine (~1.4GB OGMs), 
playback will pause for up to 10 seconds. I see the following in dmesg;
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x64
hda: DMA interrupt recovery
hda: lost interrupt
The drive then recovers and playback resumes, no problem.
Is this likely to be the first signs of a faulty HD, or is it some known 
problem? In the event that it's the HD, has anybody been able to successfully 
RMA a Maxtor which has this, albeit minor, problem?

Alistair.
