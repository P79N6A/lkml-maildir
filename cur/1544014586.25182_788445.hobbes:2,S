Yes. After verifying that "cpu" is in a valid range.

Well, the good news is that it really would be just a few - admittedly 
very subtle - lines, each basically generating just a couple of machine 
instructions. So we'd be looking at code where the actual assembly output 
should hopefully be in the ten-to-twenty instruction range, and the C code 
itself would be about five times as many comments as actual real lines.
So the code really shouldn't be much worse than
	/*
	 * Look out! "thread" is an entirely speculative pointer
	 * access and not reliable.
	 */
	void loop_while_oncpu(struct mutex *lock, struct thread_struct *thread)
	{
		for (;;) {
			unsigned cpu;
			struct runqueue *rq;
			if (lock->owner != thread)
				break;
			/*
			 * Need to access the cpu field knowing that
			 * DEBUG_PAGEALLOC could have unmapped it if
			 * the mutex owner just released it and exited.
			 */
			if (__get_user(cpu, &thread->cpu))
				break;
			/*
			 * Even if the access succeeded (likely case),
			 * the cpu field may no longer be valid. FIXME:
			 * this needs to validate that we can do a
			 * get_cpu() and that we have the percpu area.
			 */
			if (cpu >= NR_CPUS)
				break;
			if (!cpu_online(cpu))
				break;
			/*
			 * Is that thread really running on that cpu?
			 */
			rq = cpu_rq(cpu);
			if (task_thread_info(rq->curr) != thread)
				break;
			cpu_relax();
		}
	}
and it all looks like it shouldn't be all that bad. Yeah, it's like 50 
lines of C code, but it's mostly comments about subtle one-liners that 
really expand to almost no real code at all.
