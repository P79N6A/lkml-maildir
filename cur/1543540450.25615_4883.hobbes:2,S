Hi,
    I have recently bought sm56pci Motorola winmodem .
I have already seen linmodem.org . When I visited driver wasn't there .
1.Could anyone point me wherein I can get the driver  ?
2.Do you have any URL and developers mail address wherein I can see the work
done on other winmodems ? Ex.Lucent Winmodems
3.Where can get Technical Documentation for SM56PCI winmodem ? Do Motorola
people appreciate it .
    Any help in this regard would be greately appreciated . I wish your
answers/comments posted to the list be personally CC'ed me .
Regards,
Madan A S
