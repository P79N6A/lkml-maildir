Linus, I confess that at the time (when I reproduced this problem on my
SCSI-only 4way/6G machine) I did not realize the importance of observing
the pattern or even just saving the log. No, I was _not_ just being stupid
but rather it was _so_ easy to panic Linux at the time (for various
reasons) that this one looked like just "yet another panic" somewhere.
Now, I am trying hard (lots of kernel compiles, bonnies, diff -urN between
linux trees, cp -a linuxA linuxB etc etc) to reproduce it and I can't.
All I remember from memory was those messages about "freeing stuff not in
datazone" etc. They were the same messages as I had on an IDE system and
the same as Mohammad and others reported on the list recently.
Regards,
Tigran
