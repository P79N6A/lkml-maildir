How often is "bisectability" being broken already before merge in
subsystem trees, and how often only in the context of the merge result?
(Probably impossible to answer because nobody has the data.)
Much of the former type of breakage (if we really have such breakage)
could probably be found in mostly automated ways and by volunteer
testers, by regularly testing the subsystem trees.
