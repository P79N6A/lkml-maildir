I should have said "Process B gets a signal" instead of "Process B is 
interrupted". I was just misleaded by the name down_interruptible.
The situation I am looking at is:
1. A signal is pending for Process B
2. Process B runs  waking_non_zero before A calls up
3. Process A calls up before B calls atomic_inc
The point is that the test of sem->waking and the atomic_inc(&sem->count) are 
not done in one atomic operation.
In single steps:
Process B is woken up by a signal
Process B runs waking_non_zero (sem->waking is still == 0)
Process B does not break the loop
Process A calls up and branches to call __up, which will do sem->waking++
          This happnes because sem->count was still < 0
Process B tests signal_pending(tsk)
Process B leaves the loop
Process B calls atomic_inc(sem->count)
I know that this is a very unlikly situation, so it shouldn't take too much 
attention.
