Register_disk seems to be related to partitions... and is yet another
place where floppy_fops is handed out. And it doesn't seem to have a
corresponding unregister_disk function, so this worries me
somewhat. Who did that, and why didn't he contact me?

Ok. So maybe some kind of counter? When it drops to zero, dump the
cache?

Good. But then, what's the point of devfs=only ? I assumed this was
intended for situations where we had a direct mapping from filename to
device.
Ok, so in 2.5 will be possible with struct block_device, and the
option will make sense.
So, in the interest of stability, shouldn't we (temporarily) disable
this devfs=only stuff in 2.4 ?

I agree. We could maybe just #ifdef those methods out, so that we
could easily add them back in 2.5 once struct block_device is in
place.
