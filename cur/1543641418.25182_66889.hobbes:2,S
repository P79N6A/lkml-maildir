Per-classzone ;)

Lack of patches is not a huge problem at present ;).  It's getting them
tested for performance, stability and general does-good-thingsness
which is the rate limiting step.
The next really significant design change in the queue is slablru,
and we'll need to let that sit in partial isolation for a while to
make sure that it's doing what we want it to do.
But yes, I'm interested in a port of the code, and in the description
of the problems which it solves, and how it solves them.  But what is
even more valuable than the code is a report of its before-and-after
effectiveness under a broad range of loads on a broad range of 
hardware.  That's the most time-consuming part...
