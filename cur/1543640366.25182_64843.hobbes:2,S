Hi,
As I really don't know who is in charge of this part of the kernel
(there was no names in the file or around this file), I post directly
on the Linux Kernel mailing-list.
Sorry, if I'm wrong.
I tried to compile the 2.4.19 for my computer, but I get an error
message while compiling the file:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.19smp/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm/aicasm_gram.y
[fleury@yggdrasil aicasm]$ pwd

Could somebody help me to fix this ?
The two missing `;' are easy to fix, but the missing `aicdb.h' and
more over the other errors (previously defined and type mismatch) are
difficult for me.
Thanks

The most important thing in the programming language is the name.
A language will not succeed without a good name. I have recently
invented a very good name and now I am looking for a suitable language.
