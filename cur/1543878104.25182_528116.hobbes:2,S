Yes.  Where "indent" is measured -- always!! -- in tabs.
Documentation/Coding style is quite explicit on that point:
	Outside of comments, documentation and except in Kconfig,
	spaces are never used for indentation ...
Note also:
	Statements longer than 80 columns will be broken into sensible
	chunks.   Descendants are always substantially shorter than the
	parent and are placed substantially to the right. The same applies
	to function headers with a long argument list. Long strings are
	as well broken into shorter strings.
So not just "more" indent, but "substantially more".  (Although one
could quibble, this is "expression" not "statement".  Don't quibble.)

We disagree.  The "inner" block should in all cases have one-tab indent.
And CodingStyle says that line 2 should have "substantially more" indent...
Think of it this way:  when the condition becomes so complex that it
no longer fits on one line, that block should never be re-indented.
Only the condition needs to be reworked to fit into 80 columns.
The entire point of "substantially more" is to stand out from the normal
"indent by one tab" rule" ... so that it's not mistaken for anything
except a line-wrap reformat.

No, that's a clear violation of CodingStyle on two separate points:
(a) the "always use tabs" rule, (b) the "substantially more" rule.
Note also that the notion of using spaces is for indents is clearly
described there as "heresy" .. your fu needs review if not overhaul.
