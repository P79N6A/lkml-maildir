Oh, no argument about how we got here.  The ids started out in C code 
for good reasons.  Linus always says "do what you need to do, and no 
more" and IMO he's right.  And we did exactly that :)

Again, my philosophy:  put the data in its most natural form.  In 
CS-speak, domain-specific languages.  So, just figure out what you want 
the data files to look like, and I'll volunteer to write the parser for it.
An overall goal for metadata is to collect it in one place.  I mentioned 
earlier about moving the simple "obj-$(foo) += foo.o" out of Makefiles 
and into Kconfig.  So putting PCI IDs in Kconfig files is one idea. 
Note that Kconfigs can be split up and #include'd, so it can be 
partitioned neatly in a single directory as the maintainer desires.
Another option is a few collections of files:  drivers/net/pci.ids, 
drivers/sound/pci.ids, and these would hold pci ids and driver assocations.
I'm sure the people CC'd here have even better suggestions.
One the PCI ID data format is chosen, automated tools generate the 
required C code so that the kernel source code (and behavior) is 
essentially unchanged.
