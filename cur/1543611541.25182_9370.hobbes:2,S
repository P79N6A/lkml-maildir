I don't have any non-Dell machines with the eepro100, but I did put one of
our Dells on 2.2.16 35 hours ago with the eepro100 driver.  I don't know the
exact model, but it's an older dual 500MHz PIII machine.  Traffic is light,
with only appoximately 100MB being transfered over the network so far.
Is there a workload that can reproduce the hang?  If so, I might be able to
do a bit of testing...
I've also got a couple Dell 2400s, but those are still running 2.4.9. 
Unfortunately those are production machines, so I don't want to mess with
them right now.
