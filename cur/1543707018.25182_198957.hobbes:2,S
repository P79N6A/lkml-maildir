That's the point, the original 1234 may not really be bad.

It's invisible unlesss the o/s chooses to see. By default there would 
never be an attempt to recheck the original sector 1234 unless the o/s 
tells the drive to do so. It may be that a write to the sector will work 
and there is nothing wrong with the sector (transient errors could be 
caused by mechanical or electrical transients, more likely in a laptop).
