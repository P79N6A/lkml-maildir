NVidia is one of the better examples (and I leave the binary driver
discusion out) - they supported their drivers from the start (and the
first years there were lots of trouble with official builds every other
day or so IIRC).

Of course implies "maintaing a driver for Linux" that such
maintenance/development/call-it-what-you-want is done (and not only for
4K-stacks - this just a current example and probably needs handling on
the driver side and providing some "compatibility layer" won't work that
good).
My doubt is that (above supposed old-economy) $COMPANY (which was more
or less "forced" to support Linux and didn't "freely" choose that way
like NVidia) writes a driver (or payed someone external once for it) and
considers the "Linux case" closed for the next 3 years (as you would
with a Win*-driver).
