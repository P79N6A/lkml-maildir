That's actually platform-specific.  If there's only one possible
clocksource, that'd be the normal answer.
Otherwise, there can be multiple clocksources just like any other
architecture.  Maybe there's an always-present 32 KHz counter, and
a bank of timers that can run at higher frequences ... but those
may not be available for timekeeping on all boards, maybe because
they're used for something else (motor control, etc) or because the
system has prioritized battery life over timestamp precision.
So don't assume any platform doesn't use clocksource initcalls.
