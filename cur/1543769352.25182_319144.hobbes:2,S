Subject: Recent saa7134 changes create noise when switching channels

When using saa7134 with oss=1 (and actually making use of it, e.g. mplayer -tv 
driver=v4l2:device=/dev/video0:adevice=/dev/dsp1:immediatemode=0 tv://1), the 
current driver causes around 2 seconds of noise every time the channel is 
switched (this is with a KNC1 card).
A slightly older version doesn't create the noise; instead, its sound starts a 
bit after the video is playing. Guess the older versions sleep()ed before 
unmuting the OSS device or something.
Any pointers to where to look, assuming I don't have the time to read the full 
diff ATM?
Last known good: 2.6.10-mm2
First known bad: 2.6.12-rc1-mm1
