Some of it you cant do without userspace (eg dhcp). I'd like to lose the
IP autoconfig code, it doesnt handle some interface types, it can't handle
some of the common bootp daemon extras and it has some unfunny routing
interaction wiht the kernel which are not clean (tm).
On the other hand for 2.4 we can only do this if someone has or will do the
usermode initrd for it and put it up somewhere.  Post 2.4 it has-to-go.
DHCP is the routine system now, we already cant handle it without an initrd
