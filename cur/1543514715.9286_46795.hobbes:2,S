All the solutions we currently have for filesystems on flash present a block 
device rather than a filesystem interface - that is, both FTL and NFTL act as 
an extra translation layer below the actual filesystem, providing 512-byte 
random block access for use by a traditional filesystem. 
It would probably be more efficient to implement a filesystem directly on the 
flash, much like Microsoft's FFS2, except that FFS2 obviously isn't 
POSIX-compliant, and hence isn't very interesting to us, although we do have 
the beginnings of a filesystem driver for it.
As there are patent problems with both FTL and NFTL, it would be extremely 
useful to have a POSIX-compliant filesystem designed specifically for use on 
flash devices. 
I think that there is already such a beast in existence, designed for QNX. It
would be nice to either support this or write a replacement. 
Contact me if you're interested in following this up.
