I didn't ever get round to making the timer use the RTC instead, although I 
occasionally notice it somewhere down my TODO list.
What the PC speaker driver does at the moment is increase the irq0 timer rate 
by <n> times, then call the old routine once in every <n> interrupts, after 
doing the actual speaker stuff.
You can't use the RTC for the PC speaker, because it can't interrupt fast 
enough. That's why we need to shift the system timer onto the RTC.

On platforms which support this kind of thing, #include <asm/timex.h> and use:
static inline cycles_t get_cycles (void);
On platforms which don't support it, this should always return zero.
