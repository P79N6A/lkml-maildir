" I am planning to have remote keyboard to control the operations on a
  particular target. To explain in detail, I will have a PC with keyboard,
  mouse etc and this PC will be connected to another PC(Remote) via 
Ethernet.
Instead of using the local keyboard input, I want sent the keyboard keys
from the remote system (another PC via Ethernet) and use it as if it 
from
  the local keyboard.
My Plan
  I am planning to use the Linux keyboard driver and read the keyboard 
buffer
from the remote PC and send it to the target PC, and in the target PC
  whatever the key code I have received through the Ethernet I will put it
into the local keyboard buffer using the Linux keyboard driver IOCTLs.
  Can anybody tell me is this acceptable "
