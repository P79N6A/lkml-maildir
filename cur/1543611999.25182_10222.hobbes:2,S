Most modern motherboards use a 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 divider on the memory bus
(set in BIOS) to get PCI values.  idebus= is used for anything other
than 33MHz:
Mem	PCI	divider	idebus=
66	33	1/2	default
75	37.5	1/2	38
85	42.5	1/2	43
100	33	1/3	default
133	33	1/4	default
For example, setting the bus at 75MHz would mean 'idebus=38' on the boot
command line or in lilo to prevent timing problems which could lead to
disk data corruption.  Most PCI bus related data corruption occured when
driving the bus more than 15% over spec.
