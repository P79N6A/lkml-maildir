You can't expect a machine just released a couple of weeks ago by
Apple to be fully supported by linux, do you ? :)

If it's a new Mobility 9600 machine, then I expect my 2.6 tree
(bk://ppc.bkbits.net/linuxppc-2.5-benh or rsync from source.mvista.com)
to work, though the actual backlight "scale" may not be fully correct
yet.

Unfortunately, there's isn't much HW documentation available for these
babies, other than reading Apple darwin source, Open Firmware forth
code, etc...
Regarding overall power management (that is machine sleep), it is not
supported on these machines yet. The blocking factor is the new ATI chip,
which need to be rebooted from scratch. ATI told me they might be able to
send me tables to do that though, so there is hope.
