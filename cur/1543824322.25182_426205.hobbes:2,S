Here you are:
The PCI_BUS_FLAGS_NO_MSI bus flags does not appear do be inherited
correctly from the amd8131 MSI quirk to its parent busses. It makes
devices behind a bridge behind amd8131 try to enable MSI while the
amd8131 does not support it.
We fix this by looking at flags of all parent busses in
pci_enable_msi() and pci_enable_msix().
By the way, also add the missing dev->no_msi check in pci_enable_msix()
