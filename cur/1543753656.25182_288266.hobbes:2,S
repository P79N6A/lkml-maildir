Hm, how about this idea for cutting about 500 more lines from the code:
Why not drop the "fs" part of relayfs and just make the code a set of
struct file_operations.  That way you could have "relayfs-like" files in
any ram based file system that is being used.  Then, a user could use
these fops and assorted interface to create debugfs or even procfs files
using this type of interface.
As relayfs really is almost the same (conceptually wise) as debugfs as
far as concept of what kinds of files will be in there (nothing anyone
would ever rely on for normal operations, but for debugging only) this
keeps users and developers from having to spread their debugging and
instrumenting files from accross two different file systems.
Just an idea...
thanks,
