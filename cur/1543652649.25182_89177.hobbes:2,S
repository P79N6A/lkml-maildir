Oh, I agree.  If we conduct a phased approach to this, what happens initially 
is that the pci drivers simply pull pci_dev out of the struct device and use 
it as previously.
However, I think the ultimate destination is to see how much of the bus 
specific stuff we can abstract by throwing an API around it.  I think IRQ, 
port and mmio are feasible.  Specific knowledge of bus posting et al may not 
be.

Well...OK.  The advantage of a pointer in struct device is that the code can 
be converted as is, and no-one has to muck with the direct accessors of the 
pci_dev->dma_mask.  However, I'll see how many of them there actually are, its 
probably just the drivers that transfer the information to 
blk_queue_bounce_limit.

I thought the 53c700 was working OK?  Richard Hirst did some extensive testing 
on a parisc with an IO-MMU for me (he caught a lot of early mapping leaks 
which I fixed).
