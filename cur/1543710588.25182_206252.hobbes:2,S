I haven't had CONFIG_REGPARM set in any of the kernels. 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 
was fine until after I first booted 2.6.4-mm1, then neither would work 
with nvidia. I also got some strange stuff happening, including checksum 
errors on the driver and I had to download it again from nvidia.com on 
two occasions, the first redownload reinstalled  once, then  chksum 
errors, the second redownload did the same as well as chksum 
segfaulting, since then it's been fine. See also the garbage I get out 
of vi in an earlier posting.

Sid.
