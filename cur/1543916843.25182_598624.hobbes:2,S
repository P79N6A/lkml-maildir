I see your point.  Still, you are using PM_SLEEP in the same file, so someone
reading the code for the first time will have to find out what it is anyway.
OTOH, the only function of PM_SLEEP is to be a replacement for
(SUSPEND || HIBERNATION).  It has no other meaning whatsoever.
[Well, sorry, I couldn't invent a better name.]

Well, since PM_SLEEP is used as (SUSPEND || HIBERNATION) everywhere else,
I think that it would actually be confusing not to use it here. :-)
