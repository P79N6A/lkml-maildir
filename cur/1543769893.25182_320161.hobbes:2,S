I must say that I continue to find this approach a bit queazifying.
After some reading of the code I'd agree that yes, it's not possible for us
to get here with `pte' pointing at the first slot of the pte page, but it's
not 100% obvious and it's possible that someone will come along later and
will change things in try_to_unmap_cluster() which cause this unmap to
suddenly do the wrong thing in rare circumstances.
IOW: I'd sleep better at night if we took a temporary and actually unmapped
the thing which we we got back from pte_offset_map()..  Am I being silly?
