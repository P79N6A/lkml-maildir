Yes I know it's a way to make something fairly cpu intensive remain 
interactive. However since it sleeps long enough (2ms at 1000Hz is just 
enough), it doesn't bring the machine to a standstill, and is easily 
killable. I doubt it is worth working around this, but I'm open to your 
comments about variations on this theme that might be a problem.
