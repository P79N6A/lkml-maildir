Right. I am sorry!
But the thing I've learned from:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/28/249
makes me _not_ think the scheduler is guilty by itself.
Although it may appear so when first-looked upon.
Now I think that the  problem I was facing that day was
also caused by swapping, which makes everything else
wait for it to finish.
So I am sorry for going off-topic here, but I couldn't
resist asking Galbraith about it.
Or I should just start a new thread like this? :-)
