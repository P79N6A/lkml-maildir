Subject: [PATCH] Immunize rcu_dereference() against crazy compiler writers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/11/664

Turns out that compiler writers are a bit more aggressive about optimizing
than one might expect.  This patch prevents a number of such optimizations
from messing up rcu_deference().  This is not merely a theoretical
problem, as evidenced by the rmb() in mce_log().
