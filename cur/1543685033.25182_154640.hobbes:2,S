(Sorry this is not strictly related to SCSI, but I could not help it.)
Regarding the use of a program from uucp suite
for console output capture,
we can use C-Kermit as well.

Or you can use C-Kermit.
See
   
http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html
for details. There are precompiled packages.

       kermit
       set line /dev/ttyS0
       set speed 9600
       connect
and you can issue other commands.
        set [space] ?
will print all the available options at that point.
(You can log the interaction into a file by issueing
a command to kermit, too, but using script and then run kermit
inside the scripted session might be easier.)
(Generally speaking hitting ? somewhere on the kermit command line
prints usable options/setting/keywords, and so
you can learn the basics very quickly.)
You can set up a startup file that sets
the device name, speed, parity, data size, etc. and
so you don't have to type all the command every time.
While I agree cu might work well for one shot job,
running a full terminal emulator like C-Kermit
helps us in the long term.
Just thought to let you know a full-featured terminal
emulator is available under linux.

Is the succinct and to the point steps
part of a widely available document?
I wish I knew this a few years ago.
