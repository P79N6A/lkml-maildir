No, i am arguing, that we can consider here the binary as a media
distribution, in the same way as we would clearly separate the compressor from
the compressed data in a auto-uncompressing executable, or the firmware from
the firmware flasher in a all-in-one firmware upgrade binary.

Indeed, the sole problem is that the current copyright and licencing
attributions de-facto sets those firmware blobs under the GPL, which of course
makes them undistributable since the GPL clearly claims that we need source
code for it, and if any condition of the GPL fails, the program becomes
undistributable as a whole.
