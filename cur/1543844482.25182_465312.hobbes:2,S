We need an additional ioctl to set both the swap partition and "resume offset"
at a time (the one we currently have allows us only to set the partition and I
don't want to change it because of the backwards compatibility, but I think
I'll change its name ;-) ).
I'd like to add this ioctl along with the one needed to support the "platform"
method of powering off, because it will require some similar documentation
changes (most importantly, the description of the interface in
Documentation/ABI which I'd like to add once and not to tamper with
afterwards).
Greetings,
Rafael
