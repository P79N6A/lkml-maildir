Umm...  I'd rather get all that stuff dealt with in one go - I've got gfp_t
conversion finished and it's waiting for 2.6.14.
Fix for that one had been sent, actually - see part 4 of gfp_t annotations
series.  Since none of that stuff is critical (the only bug caught so far
had been already fixed - see relayfs patch) and Linus decided to go for
2.6.14-final, let's hold it back and merge as soon as 2.6.14 gets released.
