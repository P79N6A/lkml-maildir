I did consider that approach at one point. The reason I rejected it
was that then container->count would no longer even vaguely represent
the number of processes in a container. Now that we have the
container_group object, we have to use that for counting the number of
processes in a container anyway, so that objection goes away.
However, I think it's important to be able to provide some kind of a
reference count that subsystems can grab (e.g. to store a reference in
a non-task object such as a file struct) without taking manage_mutex
or callback_mutex (since that would be excessively heavyweight) but
which can still be "frozen" at zero at the point when you're trying to
destroy a container. Additionally, having it per subsystem will be
important for when we implement arbitrary binding/unbinding of
subsystems from hierarchies - at that point we need to be able know
which subsystems have external reference counts, and hence aren't
removeable.
