It still brings questions to mind though, so perhaps I had better
clarify my situation somewhat, then we can all get down to some
serious discussion rather than nit-picking as seems to have been going
on...
Please note that I have NOT yet bought the drive. I wanted to check
that I could use it under Linux first.
The basic situation is that there are THREE candidates available in
the local shops, as follows:
 A. SyQuest SyJet drive, capacity 1.5G, price £149.00.
 B. SyQuest SparQ drive, capacity 1.0G, price £199.00.
 C. IOmega JazDrive, capacity 1.0G, price £379.00.
As can be clearly seen, the two SyQuest drives are considerably
cheaper than the IOmega product, and the last is currently well beyond
my price range. However, I'm rather wary re buying a product from a
defunct company...
 1. If I buy a faulty drive, who do I complain to if SyQuest
    has definately folded?
 2. Is anybody still making cartridges for it?
 3. Other than the above, are there any others that I could
    consider?
Best wishes from Riley.
