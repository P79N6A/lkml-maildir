Yes, you need to create /dev/input/event0 to /dev/input/event31:
mknod /dev/input/event0 c 13 64
mknod /dev/input/event1 c 13 65
mknod /dev/input/event2 c 13 66
mknod /dev/input/event3 c 13 67
...
mknod /dev/input/event31 c 13 95

You need uinput driver (drivers/input/misc/uinput.c). Alternatively
you might want to change your IR driver to be able to change keycodes
it emits (you need to properly set up dev->keytable and
dev->keytablesize) abnd then you can use EVIOCSKEYCODE ioctl on
corresponding even device to change mapping.
