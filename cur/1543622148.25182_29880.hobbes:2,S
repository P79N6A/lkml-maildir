Oh come on, how hard is the following?

You have tons of flexibility you are ignoring here...  For the
non-hotplug hosts (ie. present at boot), just use pci_driver::probe to
register hosts on a list, and little other work.  do_deferred_work()
handles the list in a manner that ensures proper boot and/or host
ordering.
So for non-hotplug hosts you do a init_module time:
	register N hosts with PCI API
	register N hosts with SCSI API
And hotplugged hosts would do the same, with N==1.
What you describe -is- supported with the PCI API.
