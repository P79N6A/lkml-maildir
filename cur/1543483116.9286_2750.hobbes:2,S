  This is a tad premature, but I'm seeing some sendmail daemons hung
with what seems to be a kernel problem.  It seems to have more in common
with networking than anything else.
  I upgraded from linux-2.1.127 to -2.2.0 (plus the mingo/mmap patch).
A bunch of other things changed which also have to be eliminated (and
thus why this is premature), but I'm looking towards the kernel because
of what they have in common isn't the application.
  In my sub-production desktop boxes (where I do my testing) I wasn't
seeing any problems.  When I upgraded one of my more-productional boxes,
suddenly I see it.  Get a good sendmail TCP/IP session going (queue
with 133 message backlog, for example) and the network clients seem to
choke up.  The ISC dhcp daemon will just stop hearing requests, sendmail
tends to get stuck in a child process receiving the "From" address.
Not a global ethernet driver issue since other sessions (SSH slogin that
I'm looking at things that are hung up, for example) keep on going.
  I'm going to bump myself back down to -2.1.127 to eliminate the
rest of the OS and then work my way back up towards -2.2.0 and see if
it trips anywhere in particular.
  More info as I have it.
