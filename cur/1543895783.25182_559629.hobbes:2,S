Hum, then why have we introduced that lock (netdev_change_sem)
in the first place, as in what exactly is it protecting?
In any case, however, the point to extend the critical section here
to encapsulate all the three parts still stands. We wouldn't want
ioctl(NETCON_REMOVE_TARGET) on the specified target to
return without removing the target that the user specified just
because that target's ethernet interface happens to be currently
undergoing a name change. The correct behaviour would be to
sleep on a mutex till the renaming has completed (which will
then relinquish the mutex) and then (after acquiring the mutex)
proceed to remove it, IMHO.

I think you're referring to make_class_name() here? That seems to
be somewhat bulkier than simply being a wrapper over kasprintf()
like the make_netdev_class_name() here. I'd definitely recommend
not obfuscating this simple functionality here.
