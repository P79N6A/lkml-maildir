Hello, I'm using linux 2.6.9, Debian's gpm 1.19.6-18 package, on my g3
ibook. I'm using the frame buffer console. I've compiled in:
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS=y
CONFIG_FB_OF=y
CONFIG_FB_RADEON=y
CONFIG_FB_RADEON_I2C=y
When I use gpm to "mouse over" characters on the console, the character
under the cursor is removed, and it isn't re-drawn when the mouse leaves
the character. It is only re-drawn when selected with gpm -- scrolling
the screen doesn't re-paint the characters.
So, the screen will look something like this:
# CONFIG_FB_ATY128 is not set
# CONFIG     TY is not set
# CONFIG FB_  S is no    t
# CONFIG FB_N  MAGIC  s not set
# CONFI  FB_KY   is  ot set
# CONFIG_FB_3DF     not set

Any suggestions? Thanks
