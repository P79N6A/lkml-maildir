We aren't doing threaded probes or anything yet, so on a given
machine, device names should be deterministic.
Of course, if you reconfigure the machine, the driver may find
devices in a different order and name them something different.
I don't see a way to avoid that.
And couldn't we use udev to associate a fixed name with a MAC
address?  Then the user could use the same persistent name,
regardless of the order in which the driver found the devices.
