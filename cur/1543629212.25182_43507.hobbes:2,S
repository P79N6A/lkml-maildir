Now imagine an 8 node system, with 4Gb of memory in each node.
First 4Gb is in node 0, second 4Gb is in node 1, etc.
Even with 64 bit DMA, the real problem is breaking the assumption
that mem between 0 and 896Mb phys maps 1-1 onto kernel space.
That's 90% of the difficulty of what Dan's doing anyway, as I
see it.
