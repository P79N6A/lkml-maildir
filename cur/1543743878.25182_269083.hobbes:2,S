The original driver assumed that the request is at most 2048 bytes. If 
the request is longer, the readahead code oopses. Now that code is gone, 
readahead is handled by higher layers in the kernel. The driver 
performance might be increased by reading more than one CD-ROM sector at 
a time. I've tried to do that but got hard lockups.

I've left the debugging enabled because I feel that it might be needed. 
My drive is rev 1.0d. I wonder if there's anyone who still has (working) 
single-speed CDU31A drive.
Also I have tested only polled mode - interrupts and DMA disabled on the 
controller (the driver does not support DMA anyway and the comments say 
that it is not good for double speed drives).

I'll try to fix this problem.

It (sometimes?) does bad things for me when I use "eject -x 1" (or 2) to 
change the speed while copying files. I think that it's because of 
bad/no locking.
