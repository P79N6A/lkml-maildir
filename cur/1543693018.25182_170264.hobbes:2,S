Cool, I'll push these two patches to Linus.
I've seen 2.4.x patches from Allen Martin@nVidia on lkml.
In UDMA133 patch he mentioned that UDMA should be programmed by mode,
not UDMA cycle timing on nVidia chipsets (probably the same applies to AMD).
Can you comment on this?
Also please don't add new SATA chipsets to drivers/ide.
They should be handled by jgarzik's libata.
Thanks,
