It was just a suggestion.  Please:
- test the patches which are presently in -mm.  I don't even know if they
  work, and we prefer to send Linus working stuff.
- Send fine-grained incremental patches.  It's OK to do complete
  replacement patchsets when the code is new, but this stuff is supposed to
  be stabilised.
  It took me quite a lot of time to extract the incremental patches out
  of try#12 and I don't want to do it again, plus it's just another step in
  which errors can be introduced.
Why incremental patches?
- So we can see what changed and don't have to re-review the whole thing
- So the recipient doesn't have to re-fix the same pile of rejects each time.
- So fixes which came in via other sources don't get lost.
