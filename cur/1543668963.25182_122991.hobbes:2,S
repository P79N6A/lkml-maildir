On A7V with BIOS 1012a01 2.5.40+ ACPI always worked flawlessly, while 2.4.x has
problems. Currently (2.4.21-pre7) is better than before: it writes some panic
to screen, but poweroffs immediately after that (and sorry, nearest serial 
console is about 5km far away, and everybody should use 2.5.x anyway), so I
always suspected that problem is not in poweroff itself, but in some
driver's devexit procedure (I have enabled hotplug in kernel, so __devexit
is not stripped out).
And if you are talking about A7V, for some old ACPI (maybe all 2.4.x, I have
no idea) take a look at
