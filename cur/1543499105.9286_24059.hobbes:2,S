Not, AFAIK. Can of worms there: you can access disk beyond 1024 cylinder only
with new extended BIOS calls and quite a few BIOSes has subtle errors there :-((

What for ? It will need TONS of debugging to catch all possible weird

Windows98 does not boots from partitions started after 1023 cylinder here.
And since msdos.sys/ntkrnl usually (but not always) sit in the very beginning
of disk (installer will try to do this) this problem usually is just irrelevant.
But Win9x and NT HAVE this problem as well. At least on some systems...
