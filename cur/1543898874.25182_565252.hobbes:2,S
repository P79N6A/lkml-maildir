I can agree.
We can be more permissive: it can be done anywhere after the new
data is put in place and before nfs_readpage() or nfs_readpages()
returns.
I saw your patch 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=118352909826277&w=2
that modifies e.g. mm/memory.c and not the NFS layer.
Have you proposed a patch against the NFS layer?

I can agree.
Note that it has not got much performance impact from our point
of view because there are not too many COW paves with executable code...

If it were do_no_page() that would fix the problem, then it should know
where the page comes from in order not to flush the I-cache in vain.
do_no_page() just calls vma->vm_ops->nopage() that goes down to
fs_op->readpage() / fs_op->readpages().
On the other hand, these latter routines do not know why they fetch
the page(s). Note that a page can be mapped more than one times, with
different permission bits.
As a consequence, these routines will flush the I-cache in vain in
most of the cases.
I prefer a performance impact to some non DMA based file systems
and adding nothing to the path for the majority of the cases.
> BTW, can we know whether a page is filled by DMA or not  ?
Well, the file systems based on block devices use DMA transfer
(with the exception of using bounce buffers, in that case it is the
responsibility of the bounce buffering layer to flush the I-cache).
Network based file systems require revision and update...
Note that only the processors with separate L2I require
attention, the L1I is guaranteed to be flushed when you change
the corresponding TBL entry.
The base kernel should provide a macro / service (that cares for the
processor model) for the file systems.
