Someone in this thread brought up pinfo, which I have since tried, and  
it's really nice. At least the way it's done in the Debian package, it  
also reads man, it uses highlighting sensibly (the absence of which in  
info docs has been irritating me for a long time), and it tries to turn  
references into links ... oh, and it can follow URLs by invoking lynx.
