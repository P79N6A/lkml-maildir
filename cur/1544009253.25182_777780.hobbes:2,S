I was able to reproduce it with the .config you attached, and running it in kvm.
It is caused by:
  "modprobe cryptomgr" called from swapper[1]
This modprobe process does try to log an error, accesses /dev/console,
which is not initialized in the kernel at that time, and the kernel
module loader tries the load a module to support dev_t 5:1, which
again runs modprobe, and ...
Setting CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER=y makes it disapper. The patch I sent
seems to fix it.
The bug is handled here:
