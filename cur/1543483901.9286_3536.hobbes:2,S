By 'turning off everything' you really mean you turned ON the IRQ
unmasking, right?  It's kinda a double-negative, but this is what you mf
want:
hdparm -u 1 /dev/hda
****DISCLAIMER**** in the man page for hdparm you will note that unmasking
the IRQ has been known to cause filesystem corruption in some certain
(buggy?) configurations.  Therefore, while the above works for me and for
others, I didn't tell you to do it.
