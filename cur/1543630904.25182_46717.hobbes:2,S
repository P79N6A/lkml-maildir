data=journal is not in very good state.
data=ordered works for normal use, but it will fail in heavy testing
on SMP due to exposure of preexisting bugs.  I have forward ported a
couple of Stephen's patches which appear to fix that up.
data=writeback should be OK.
I'll get the ext3 fixes out over the next few days.
