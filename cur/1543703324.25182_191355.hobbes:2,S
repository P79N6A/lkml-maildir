Would it really? If we use /usr/src/linux (for example) to store
the code of one single kernel and have a user with permission to
write to /usr/src/linux and not to /usr/src, then he couldn't
remove /usr/src, but only /usr/src/linux, right?
I'm not sure if I understand you correctly, and you might mean
that the problem in make gconfig isn't fixed. That's true, but
I'm not the maintainer so I'm just trying to help you find a
solution that will work for now.
