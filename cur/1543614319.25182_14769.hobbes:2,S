Not completely, but that's because in some cases I don't know whether decimal
or binary multiples are involved.  Where that is the case I have left the
ambiguous terminology in place.

I don't know yet.  I can only clean up the bits for which I am maintainer.

The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions, 
that I wish it always to be kept alive.  It will often be exercised when 
wrong, but better so than not to be exercised at all. I like a little 
rebellion now and then.	-- Thomas Jefferson, letter to Abigail Adams, 1787
