I've not actually seen truncate_inode_pages' "I goofed!" message
(except when I added further debug to cover lstart != 0 truncation,
which fsx is keen on), but I think it could occur even in that case.
It seems that __lookup() can easily return 0, even though there's
more to find, if it starts partway into a RADIX_TREE_MAP_SIZE
array, in which the only occupied slots are before it starts.
Patch below seems to fix it, but I bet you can improve upon it.
Might this relate to Trond/Chuck's NFS invalidation woes?
It's certainly the main contributor to my tmpfs problems.
I look forward to your "erk" - or will you delight us with
some other exclamation?!
Hugh
