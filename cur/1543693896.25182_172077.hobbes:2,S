Yeah, if a task has become unrunnable, I do a SIGPOWER (with a new cpu siginfo
field).  If hotplug CPUs had been introduced at the same time as affinity,
this would IMHO have been a valid approach, but may not be so now.
See my kernel.org page, and the sourceforge mailing list for details.
I haven't done anything fancy with cpu offlining, but the most painful bit
is all the callbacks for workqueue threads, migration threads etc.  Once
that's in place, doing the atomic-style switch should be quite possible.
There's a theoretical case where code would do:
	spin_lock
	foo[smp_processor_id()]++;
	...
	foo[smp_processor_id()]--;
	spin_unlock
So you might want to fake up the answer to smp_processor_id() for that
task/interrupt.  Other real per-cpu things might have problems (if you
were halfway through fiddling with the interrupt state on that CPU,
maybe MTRR), but that's what makes it fun.
Cheers,
Rusty.
