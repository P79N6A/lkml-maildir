O_o You misunderstand me... I just like some hints about to do it by
myself.
Since (most probably) you are the one which should accept or deny my
patch I simple asked to you how I should do the job in order to avoid
a reject! :)
The name of the attribute, which should be its default behaviour and
an hint where should I put the code (just a file name or a function
one).
Thanks in advance,
Rodolfo
