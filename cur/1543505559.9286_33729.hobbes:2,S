Yes (updated in March 1999)
Technical Note 1150 does provide enough information (aparently)
to write support for HFS+:
http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150.html
Darwin OS source code (from 
http://publicsource.apple.com/
)
contains a working HFS+ file system implementation that can be
used as a reference in case of lacks in the documentation.
