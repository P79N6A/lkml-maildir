Fixed.
Request:  can the checker check for skb's being freed correctly?  The
rules:
If an skb is in interrupt context, call dev_kfree_skb_irq.
If an skb might be in interrupt context, call dev_kfree_skb_any.
If an skb is not in interrupt context, call dev_kfree_skb.
I also found and fixed an error of this sort on cops.c as well.

Fixed.
I dunno WTF the programmer was thinking here...  Your de-ref checker
should have caught this too:  check 'lp' for NULL after de-referencing
lp->lock.

Seems to be fixed already.
