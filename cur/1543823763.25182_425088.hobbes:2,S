Not a linux kernel backdoor.
There sure are lots of software systems running on linux, some of them
may be easy to mess up like that.  If you worry about that, go for
sw with a good security record.  qmail for your mail, perhaps?
Also, a nice thing with these application backdoors is that not
everybody have them.  There are many mail packages to choose
from, and there are many systems with none at all even. The same applies
to almost every other app.  You probably find "bash" on just about every
linux though.
