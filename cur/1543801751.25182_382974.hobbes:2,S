Is that patch complete?  (This is all I got.)

In the absence of any use of TASK_NONINTERACTIVE in conjunction with 
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE it will have no effect.  Personally, I think that 
all TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleeps should be treated as non interactive 
rather than just be heavily discounted (and that TASK_NONINTERACTIVE 
shouldn't be needed in conjunction with it) BUT I may be wrong 
especially w.r.t. media streamers such as audio and video players and 
the mechanisms they use to do sleeps between cpu bursts.
