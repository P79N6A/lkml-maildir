So you'll create a symlink. (If you're Ingvar Kamprad, it will be named bjørn.)

If you
- add a SCSI controler
- add an USB burner
- connect to an aoe/iscsi-device(?),
it will get a random ID. If you reboot (or just plug out/plug in), it will
be randomly different. The same thing may happen after a system upgrade,
possibly depending on the linker.
In these cases, there is nothing you can remember, and you'll have to run
-scanbus in order to find out if your burner is 0.8.15 or maybe 32.16.8
_each_ time you want to burn a CD. But you _can_ remember (or write into
your config files) that it will be named /udev/cdr/LITE-ON_LTR-48246K.
Having to find out the magic number of the day is usurally worse than
using the very same name you usurally use to identify an object. If you
see an advantage, let the ATAPI bus be -3, translate -3,$n,0.0 to
"/dev/hd".chr(96+$n) and everybody will be happy.
