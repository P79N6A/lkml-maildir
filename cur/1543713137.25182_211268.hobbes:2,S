Not sure but I find your way very risky since writepage operations are
address space methods, it's like calling an object method with a null
object as parameter, very risky and dirty, and the primary reason I
wanted my swap cache to have a true page_mapping(page) ==
&swapper_space, your swapcache having a null mapping looks very dirty to
me and that's why I avoided it.
Note that the same way you drop the swapper_space with your code
applied, you could drop it indipendently from mainline too w/o any other
change. I much prefer to have a real swapper_space with a real tree_lock
with a real ->writepage callback etc..

I wouldn't need to call add_to_page_cache either, it's just Andrew
prefers it.

though your code still has no way to work since it will clash on the
compound page just like mine. Note that my code already works fine as
far as it's not a compound page, as far as Andrew's code works in
mainline, my code will work fine, if my code doesn't work yours cannot
either (we both clash in the compound page infact).
