Dear Matija!
    I tried to boot from umsdos file system. Maybe the problem dosn't
    with this...
[1.] One line summary of the problem:
2.3.0 kernel booting from umsdos
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
    I installed the modules, and placed to / the zImage and
    corrected the loadlin parameter.
    The new boot started, but after uncompressing the started boot
halted.
    Only one line is on screen:
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
    umsdos, kernel
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.0.36 (root@monkey) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 Thu Nov 19
03:19:57 MET 1998
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
    problem (if possible)

[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
    This isn't new problem. I tried the 2.1.130, 2.2.7 and the result
was
    similar. The original 2.0.36 works well!
    If You aren't familiar with Monkey (Mini) Linux:
    This distribution must install to vfat or msdos filesystem and uses
umsdos.
    Can be receive from:
  ftp.spsselib.hiedu.cz/pub/linux
    It uses the libc5. I installed the rpm, and extended the original
system
    with RedHat 5.2 packages.
Many thanks
