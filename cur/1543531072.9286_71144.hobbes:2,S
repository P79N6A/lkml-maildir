If you are running batch jobs, you can do all this without using logon
restrictions etc - just set the job scheduler accordingly.

No. These are running server software anyway, not a load of
interactive user tasks. Since you only HAVE one (or maybe two)
"users", and every job is mission-critical, your quotas cause problems
here, without helping.
If the system IS properly sized, and the software does not
malfunction, you never go OOM anyway. If either of these does not
hold, your system is hosed anyway. A "live" WWW server which has
killed the httpd is no use to anyone.

No. If your banking software malfunctions, you have bigger problems
than what recovery measures the kernel can or cannot implement.

No. Single user environment; if you are OOM, the one and only task has
failed already - it's too late for the OS to help you now.

No. See (1).

And they don't, at least from OOM conditions.
