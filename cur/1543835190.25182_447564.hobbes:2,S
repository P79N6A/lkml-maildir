I do not understand this. Any polling (in kernel or in userspace) will
wake the CPU, wasting power.
OTOH "high/low/very low" battery applet can reasonably query battery
every 5 minutes, while detailed, graphical thingie displaying the
current power consumption will probably poll every 10 seconds...
