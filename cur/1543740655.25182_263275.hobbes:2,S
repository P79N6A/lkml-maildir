What's described above is not what the patch implements. The patch is
calling update_mmu_cache() in a loop on all the virtual base pages of a
virtual hugepage, which won't help at all, as it doesn't understand how
to find the hugepages regardless of virtual address. AFAICT code to
actually do the equivalent of update_mmu_cache() on hugepages most
likely involves privileged instructions and perhaps digging around some
cpu-specific data structures (e.g. the natively architected pagetables
bearing no resemblance to Linux') for almost every non-x86 architecture.
