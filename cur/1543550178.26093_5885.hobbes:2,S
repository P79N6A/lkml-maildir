well, you can still use the other event counter. And you can clear the
first counter as well. The Intel performance monitoring utility (perfmon?)  
has been using this NMI technique for years, so it's probably the only way
to get periodic NMIs on UP systems, without any extra hardware.

unfortunately not. It ignores this setting. I tried it years ago :-)

the zero-page is added if there is no APIC detected, so it's intended
behavior - if there is an APIC in a CPU then we definitely want to enable
it during bootup!
