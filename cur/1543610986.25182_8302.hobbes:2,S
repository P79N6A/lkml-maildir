Hey there, Alan and the rest of you.
I was just wondering whether or not it would be a waste of time creating a patch with one goal in mind: substituting 
references to linux/malloc.h with references to linux/slab.h throughout the 2.2 tree. 
Inconsistency is a Bad Thing[tm], and since malloc.h now only includes slab.h, I feel that it is time for a major clean-up.
Any thoughts ?
