Yes, if it were a perfect world and we had access to all the hardware
specs like Microsoft does, we would not need these users' help.  But the
users have access to a lot more hardware than the developers do and
trial and error is often the only solution.
If they give up and go back to Windows we may never support their
hardware correctly.
