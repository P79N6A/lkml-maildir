Well, independently of whether we actually discharge them or not, I do 
tend to always like things that split independent concepts up (whether 
they then end up being _implemented_ independently of each other or not is 
a separate issue).
So patches 1-4 all look fine to me. In fact, 5 looks ok too.
Whether we actually then want to do 6 is another matter. I think we'd need 
some measuring and discussion about that.
I'm absolutely 100% sure that we do *not* want to be in a situation where 
we have two different implementations of tasklets, and just keep the 
CONFIG variable and let people just choose one or the other.
So imnsho doing #6 is really something that makes sense only in a "let's 
measure this and decide which implementation is actually the better one", 
_not_ in the sense of merging it into the standard kernel and letting them 
fight it out in the long run.
But I'd happily merge 1-4 regardless after 2.6.22 is out.
Leaving patch 6 as a "only makes sense after we actually have some numbers 
about it", and patch 5 is a "could go either way" as far as I'm concerned 
(ie I could merge it together with the 1-4 series, but I think it's 
equally valid to just see it as a companion to 6).
Does that make sense to people?
