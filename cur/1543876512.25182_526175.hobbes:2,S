Hi,
this is a repost as I like to know the current state of the problem...
The USB DMA size problem is known to exist on Linux since February 2004.
I am still in hope that there will be a fix soon.

Is there any reason not to have one single ioctl for one basic feature?

At the time the call SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE has been discussed/defined, we did 
originally agree that the max value should be limited to what the HW allows
as DMA size. This is why I did originally files a bug against 
SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE.
