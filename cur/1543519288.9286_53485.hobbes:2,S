Quite possible, however the original poster implied that
distributions are currently releasing dists with devel kernels,
and although I'm sure that one or more of the dists listed on
lwn.net does do so, I'm also sure that none of the mainstream
dists accounting for 99% of the people using Linux out there
releases a dist with a devel kernel.
Even if they did, it might be the one exception to the rule in
one thousand, and saying that any particular vendor releases
dists with devel kernels all the time is simply not true.
