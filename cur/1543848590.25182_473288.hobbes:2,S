There used to be a different way of selecting which front-ends get
built/loaded, that was recently replaced with DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE.  It was
even more complex and only worked for a few card drivers that specially
supported it.
What is nice about the new DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE way is that there is very
little code needed.  There is a boilerplate #if in the font-end header file
for the _attach function, and that's it.

A front-end could default to the highest level of the card drivers which
utilizes it.  I'm not sure how to express that in a Kconfig file, and it
would be more work to maintain.  One has to go into the FE customisation
menu to turn on DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE anyway, at which point it seems like there
is little difference between disabling the drivers one doesn't want vs
enabling the drivers one does.
