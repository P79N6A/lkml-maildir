Yes, probably we should get rid of them.
The idea wasn't sparc optimizations, it was for things like those
Dolphin clustering cards that essentially want to get at all of
physical memory from the PCI card.
The IOMMU is a limited resource, so at the expense of lack of
prefetching and write caching we provide a way to do unlimited DMA
mapping with 64-bit DAC addresses.
None of these drivers ever got integrated, so it's a total loss.
Someone will complain when we pull it out, but fsck them, they
had years to do something about this. :)
