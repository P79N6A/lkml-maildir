Subject: [PATCH] vmacct6/9 fix shared and private accounting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/7/29/221

do_mmap_pgoff's (file == NULL) check was incorrect: it caused shared
MAP_ANONYMOUS objects to be counted twice (again in shmem_file_setup),
and again on fork(); whereas the equivalent shared /dev/zero objects
were correctly counted.  Conversely, a private readonly file mapping
was (correctly) not counted, but still not counted when mprotected to
writable: mprotect_fixup had pointless "charged = 0" changes, now it
does vm_enough_memory checking when private is first made writable
(but later we may want to refine behaviour on a noreserve mapping).
Also changed correct (flags & MAP_SHARED) test in do_mmap_pgoff to
equivalent (vm_flags & VM_SHARED) test: because do_mmap_pgoff is
dealing with vm_flags rather than the input flags by that stage.
