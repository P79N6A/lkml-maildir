Hello!

Yes. BTW, look here:
kuznet@dust:~ # ip -6 a ls sit0
7: sit0@NONE: <NOARP,UP> mtu 1480 qdisc noqueue
    inet6 ::127.0.0.1/96 scope host
    inet6 ::193.233.7.100/96 scope global
    inet6 ::193.233.7.100/96 scope global
I have two equal addresses inherited from one IPv4 address
on two interfaces. Nothing illegal.

Well, it is one of well defined approaches (unlike KAME's one).
Alternative is to implement full set of options NLM_F_* like used
in IPv4 routing to block undefined cases. In IPv6 flags are hardwired
to NLM_F_CREATE|NLM_F_APPEND both for addresses and routes.
