Only to a hard real-time system.

I'm mostly interested in Linux in embedded systems, where we have a lot
of control over the overall system, such as how many processes are
running.  This makes it easier to control latencies than on a
general purpose computer.

The same way everything works for Linux:  with enough people around the
world interested in and working on these problems, they will be fixed.
