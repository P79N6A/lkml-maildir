Yup, I can confirm this.  The Marvell chip appears to control 4 SATA  
+ 1 IDE connector.
Just to make things even weirder, there's also an Intel ICH7R chip on  
the motherboard which controls a separate set of 4 SATA + 1 IDE  
connector.
At first I thought that only the Marvell SATA ports could be used for  
a RAID (based on how they're labeled in the manual), but now I see  
that either set of SATA ports can be used for RAID.  So I may be able  
to set my RAID up using the ICH7R based ports until the Marvell chip  
is supported.  Am I correct to believe that the Intel ICH7R chip is  
supported in 2.6.16?
