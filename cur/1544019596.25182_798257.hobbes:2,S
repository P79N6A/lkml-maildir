Subject: [PATCH 098/114] x86/Voyager: remove VMI Kconfig quirk
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/584

x86/Voyager has this build-time quirk:
 	bool "VMI Guest support"
 	select PARAVIRT
 	depends on X86_32
	depends on !X86_VOYAGER
Since VMI is auto-detected (and Voyager will be auto-detected) there's no
reason for this quirk.
