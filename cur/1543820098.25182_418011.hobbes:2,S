Subject: [PATCH] off-by-1 in kernel/power/main.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

there's an off-by-1 in 2.6.16.9 (and 2.6.17-rc2) 
kernel/power/main.c:state_store() ... if your kernel just happens to have 
some non-zero data at pm_states[PM_SUSPEND_MAX] (i.e. one past the end of 
the array) then it'll let you write anything you want to /sys/power/state 
and in response the box will enter S5.
i randomly discovered this because i really wanted to put my box into S5 
(for wake on lan) and tried "echo off >/sys/power/state" and was quite 
happy that the box entered S5... happy until i compiled a different kernel 
and this S5 trick stopped working :)
anyhow, this begs the question, what is the correct way to get a box to 
shutdown into s5?  on a fc4 box i have here it does that happily, but 
ubuntu boxes don't seem to go into s5... and i couldn't figure out from 
fc4 patches if they'd changed anything in this area.  pointers 
appreciated.
btw i can whip up a patch making "off" a valid value for /sys/power/state 
...
