We are on the same page, good.

Yep and update the status of the raid if we have a device fail.

No we are back to your "raid personality", and a functional API to the
ATA driver.
This is probably the first and last time I will openly agree for someone
to tell me were to go, and do it ;-).
You tell me what you want the driver to do, and I will make it happen.
It will be legal and technically correct.  Does that sound like a good
idea?
