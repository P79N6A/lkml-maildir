I don't completely disagree.  It certainly isn't the most elegant
approach I've ever seen.
Any ideas on ways we could simplify it?  I was thinking that we could
get rid of the .data member and allow access only via the mechanism I
just introduced.  It would be pretty easy to make some macros to
generate "simple" access functions for the existing global variables.
