Interesting results. Did Apache use mmap? Or it was plain old file IO?
This is getting OT, but I hope that I will be excused askining a few Qs:
1. What is the difference between these tests and the c't replication of the
Mindcraft bench. C't showed that properly configured apache in a non-MS oriented
network setup has more than reasonable performance. These results contradict.
Where is the difference that causes it?
2. All this discussion seems to go back to the Mindcraft scenario. As noted in
(1) C't showed linux to perform decently with one network card and lag when put
in windows favouring multiether setup. From the described setup by C't
(and Mindcraft): either their descriptions were incomplete, or normal unix put
in those conditions will not load balance neatly. So nothing amazing there...
3. Assuming what was said on the list about CPU usage for: 
- - parsing headers (high)
- - transfering files (low)
- - benchmarks (questions, questions ...)
Does it really worth it to go the Mindcraft/MS way and hastily put a httpd
implementation in the kernel? 
        Maybe a detailed analysis of C't results (as being less biased) and some
numbers first???
Thanks,
And once again pls execuse me for the OT.
