I only looked at docs. But Andrew Morton said:
"Your new code should really be generic, utilising the
stack-page-zeroing which CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE enables."
In fact, the other reference is in kernel/sched.c. You may (or may not) join 
the two stack walking (I would) and match a bit descriptions.
Personally, I'd put the Kconfig option in lib/Kconfig.debug and have a Kconfig 
flag named DEBUG_STACK_USAGE_SUPPORT, much like LOCKDEP_SUPPORT (defined only 
by architectures supporting the option), but have no time right now.
