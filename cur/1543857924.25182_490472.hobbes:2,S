Are you seeing it _without_ amd? The usual reason for the errors you see
are bogus replay cache replies. For that reason, the kernel is usually
very careful when initialising its value for the XID: we set part of it
using the clock value, and part of it using a random number generator.
I'm not so sure that other services are as careful.

The fileid is the same as the inode number. Just convert those
hexadecimal values into ordinary numbers, then search for them using 'ls
-i'.
