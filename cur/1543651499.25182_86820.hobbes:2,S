Have you looked at the LSB test suites yet? They already cover much of
what you plan on writing tests for, though we would welcome any
volunteers who would like to increase the coverage.  Most of the tests
suites are released under the Artistic License, with quite a bit of
the code donated by the Open Group (originally from the Unix
certification tests).
You can find more information about them here:
http://www.linuxbase.org/test
The CVS repository is on SourceForge in the LSB project.
