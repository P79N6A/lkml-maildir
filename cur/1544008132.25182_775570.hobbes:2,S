What hardware does an explicit check for fragmentation?
In most cases, aren't we just relying on the hardware checksum
to be wrong on fragmented packets? That works 99.999% of the time,
but the TCP checksum is pretty weak, and it is possible to
have a fragmented packet where the first fragment has the same
checksum as the entire packet.
I'd rather have a fragmentation check at the LRO layer to remove
any ambiguity. But if you still object, I'll at least have to
submit a patch  which adds an explicit check in myri10ge.
