I think that's the right point, but the advantage of better analysis may
not be in better finding which process does what, but deciding which
type of process we want to run and for how long. The reports of starving
this and that indicate that giving the "most interactive" process all it
can use may not be the best for the system responsiveness overall.
And the observed results from various fairness and deadline scheduling
seem to bear this out. Instead of using an override "this process has
waited too long" model, a better schudling in normal mode might be
possible.
Just my thought, not "do the same old but better," but "make better
choices for the system overall." That could target throughput or
responsiveness as desired.
