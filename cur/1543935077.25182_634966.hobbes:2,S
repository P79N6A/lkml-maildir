| When a packet arrives to the device underneath "dfd", the net code will

| callback wakeup entry on that queue, and the wake_up() performed by the 
| "dfd" net code will end up in ep_poll_callback(). At this point epoll 
| (efd1) notices that it may have some event ready, so it needs to wake up 
| the waiters on its poll wait list (efd2). So it calls ep_poll_safewake() 
| that ends up in another wake_up(), after having checked about the 
| recursion constraints. That are, no more than EP_MAX_POLLWAKE_NESTS, to 
| avoid stack blasting. Never hit the same queue, to avoid loops like:
| 
| 	epoll_ctl(efd2, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd1, ...);
| 	epoll_ctl(efd3, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd2, ...);
| 	epoll_ctl(efd4, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd3, ...);
| 	epoll_ctl(efd1, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd4, ...);
| 
| The code "if (tncur->wq == wq || ..." prevents re-entering the same

| wake_up_nested(). Although I have a feeling is not enough in this case.
| A solution may be to move the call to ep_poll_safewake() (that'd become a 
| simple wake_up()) inside a tasklet or whatever is today trendy for delayed 
| work. But his kinda scares me to be honest, since epoll has already a 
| bunch of places where it could be asynchronously hit (plus performance 
| regression will need to be verified).

it's quite possible that i'm wrong but just interested...
why in ep_poll_safewake() the assignment
	struct list_head *lsthead = &psw->wake_task_list;
is not protected by spinlock?
