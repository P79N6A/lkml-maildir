It is.

Your grep was too quick...

Yes, you forgot to tell us which kernel version you are using! And even 
more importantly which NTFS driver version?
If you are using 2.4.x then you are likely to have the old ntfs driver 
which does NOT support mounting of loopback devices.
If you are using 2.5.x then you have the new driver and what you did ought 
to have worked without problems. Also, if you are using 2.4.18/19/20-pre 
you could be using the new driver by installing our patches - you can get 
the patch for 2.4.19 from:
         
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/downloads.html
or you can clone/pull from our bitkeeper repository which is currently at 
2.4.20-pre4 or so:
         
http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-2.4
So check your kernel & ntfs version and if your ntfs driver version is 1.* 
then you know you have the old driver and if you have 2.* then you know you 
have the new driver.
Once again the old driver will not work. The new one should work just fine.
Best regards,
         Anton
