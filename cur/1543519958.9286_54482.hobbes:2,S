You are working against new scsi mid level code there.
Could you try 'ps axl' and see if there is a process/thread
with a WCHAN that starts something like "scsi...."? If there
is could you try 'ps axln' and try and resolve the numeric
WCHAN address inside your System.map file? [Is there a better
way to stop the truncation of symbolic names in the WCHAN field
to 6 characters?]
One possibility is that it is hanging in scsi_allocate_device() 
because a zero length queue has inadvertently been made for the
first device connected to that host.
