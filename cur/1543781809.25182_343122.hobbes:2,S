Because I Can (TM). Actually, I just did this because of the suspend
issue where OSX would reset some values (notably the boot sound volume),
but Linux wouldn't see this. So I figured that if I can compile it as a
module (the Kconfig option is a tristate after all) I could just unload
it. But that failed because of the alloc_bootmem issue.
I wouldn't mind having it built-in at all, if it would re-read the
cached values when resuming from suspend.
