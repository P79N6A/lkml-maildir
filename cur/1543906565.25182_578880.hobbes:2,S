I believe, that the right answer to this is barrier, but not synchronous
sending/receiving, which might slow things down noticebly. Barrier must
wait until remote side received data and send back a notice. Until
acknowledge is received, no one can say if data mirrored or ever
received by remote node or not.

Depending on what algorithm will be preferred - I do not want mirroring,
it is _too_ wasteful in terms of used storage, but it is the simplest.
Right now I still consider WEAVER codes as the fastest in distributed
envornment from what I checked before, but it is quite complex and spec
is (at least for me) not clear in all aspects right now. I did not even
start userspace implementation of that codes. (Hint: spec sucks, kidding :)
For simple mirroring each node must be split to chunks, each one has
representation bin in main node mask, when dirty full chunk is resynced.
Depending on node size and amount of memory chunk size varies. Setup is
performed during node initialization. Having checksum for each chunk
is a good step.
All interfaces are already there, although require cleanup and move from
place to place, but I decided to make initial release small.

In that blog entry I misspelled Zen with Xen - that's an error,
according to prognosis - time will judge :)
