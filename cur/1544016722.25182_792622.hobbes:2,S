Having looked at this problem just this week for some other designs I'm
thinking the regulator API might be a good fit for this.  It is a supply
and the API provides a method to match up the supply with the USB
controller (some designs have multiple options there so that's useful).
I've not actually tried it yet to see what the pain is like, though.
