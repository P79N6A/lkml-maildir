Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add percpu smp cacheline align section
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/4/570

This is follow-up for Suresh's runqueue align in smp patch at:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0704.1/0340.html
The patches place all of smp cacheline aligned percpu data into .data.percpu.cacheline_aligned_in_smp. Other percpu data is still in data.percpu section. The patches can reduce cache line access in SMP and reduce alignment gap waste. The patches also define PERCPU macro for vmlinux.lds.S for code clean up.
PATCH 1/2: Define percpu smp cacheline align interface
PATCH 2/2: Call percpu smp cacheline algin interface
Thanks.
