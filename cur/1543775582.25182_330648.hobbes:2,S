That's contary to the assumptions made by setup-res.c.  BAR0 is
dev->resource[0].  If that resource is 64-bit, dev->resource[1]
is unused and the next resource is dev->resource[2].

Are you sure you mean >> 4 ?  Don't you mean >> 32 ?  Note again that
setup-res.c writes zero unconditionally here.
The PCI subsystem is incomplete for 64-bit BAR support.  What it does
do though is ensure that 64-bit BARs will work correctly in a 32-bit
system.  Therefore, I think that folk who want 64-bit BAR support to
work need to do some code reviews on the PCI subsystem to resolve the
remaining issues.
