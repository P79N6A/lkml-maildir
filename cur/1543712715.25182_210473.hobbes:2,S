That's not what I meant. I only meant to declare the cmpxchg() function.
Nobody uses it in 386 code right now, otherwise this code would not compile
on 386 (like ACPI now). So the function would not be used by anything else
but ACPI (at the moment). Then, drivers (such as ACPI) who know they will
need cmpxchg() would be responsible for testing the flag upon initialisation
and refuse to complete initialization if the instruction is not available.

I don't like the idea of dropping 386 compatibility in the stable
series. For instance, my home firewall still was a miniature 386sx
a few months ago, so there may be other people in similar situation.
Making CONFIG_ACPI depend on CONFIG_CMPXCHG would be less of a hassle
in this case, because it would imply that people either compile for
486+ with ACPI or for 386+ without ACPI.
Cheers,
Willy
