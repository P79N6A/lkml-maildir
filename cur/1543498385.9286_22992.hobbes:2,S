	I don't see that as being the case.  What about your USB cdrom?
Or your pcmcia cdrom?  Or your firewire cdrom?  cdrom's is just one
example as well, there could be a number of other devices where the
devices fall into a similar category ('cdrom') and there exists more than
one and they are connected via different drivers.
	The only problem I see is exactly what one of the things devfs
was trying to help get rid of, a cluttered /dev.  Now you've got
/dev/<interface> and /dev/<device> directories.  Though, I suppose it
isn't as bad if there are only so many devices in a system, and the
directories are only created if a device of that type exists.
