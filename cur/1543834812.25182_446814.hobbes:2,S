No, as Heiko explained, but bug is that we fail to respect architecture 
and caller mandated alignment when CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG is enabled. With this 
patch (or Heiko's), we should be okay: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/26/93
Note that this will fix the kmem_cache_init() case too. If 
ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is greater than BYTES_PER_WORD, we'll disable 
debugging for those caches. It's obviously ok to have debugging for 
kmem_cache_init caches too if ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is greater than or 
equal to BYTES_PER_WORD.
