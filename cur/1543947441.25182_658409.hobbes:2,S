Subject: [patch 19/38] INET_DIAG: Fix inet_diag_lock_handler error path.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

2.6.24-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
Upstream commit: 8cf8e5a67fb07f583aac94482ba51a7930dab493
Fixes: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9825
The inet_diag_lock_handler function uses ERR_PTR to encode errors but
its callers were testing against NULL.
This only happens when the only inet_diag modular user, DCCP, is not
built into the kernel or available as a module.
Also there was a problem with not dropping the mutex lock when a handler
was not found, also fixed in this patch.
This caused an OOPS and ss would then hang on subsequent calls, as
&inet_diag_table_mutex was being left locked.
Thanks to spike at ml.yaroslavl.ru for report it after trying 'ss -d'
on a kernel that doesn't have DCCP available.
This bug was introduced in cset
d523a328fb0271e1a763e985a21f2488fd816e7e ("Fix inet_diag dead-lock
regression"), after 2.6.24-rc3, so just 2.6.24 seems to be affected.
