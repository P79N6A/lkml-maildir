ok, now I am a step further: I have a testcase, where I used a 10MB file with random
content. I scp'd this file from another machine to the laptop:
joerg@laptop> scp otter_machine:/tmp/10mb_file /tmp/
with the 8139too NIC module this takes 8 minutes, 32 second and has
about 97500 error on the NIC, all are RC oerruns.
When I do the same with Donald Beckers rtl8139 module then the transfer
takes 10 seconds and has about 1865 errors - not perfect but much better.
I dont want to generalize, but for my case the rtl8139 module seems
to fit much better.
Thanks for your help
Joerg
