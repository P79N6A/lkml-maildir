Hello Romano,
for me not only. I usually do not put the batteries into my laptops if not 
needed cause I read and experienced that I can extend battery life by 
that while making sure they are always charged more than 50%. Suspend to 
RAM thus wouldn't work at all for me.
I use suspend2 since 2.6.14 cause I never managed to get userspace 
software suspend working on my ThinkPad T23 and T42, not even with 
standard Debian kernel packages, didn't try the latest ones however, 
AFAIR my last try was with one 2.6.18 package. And cause its faster and 
the machine is more responsive after resuming than swsusp that I used 
upto kernel 2.6.13.
With that 1.5 GB RAM on my T42 suspending to disk with suspend2 takes 
quite some time and resuming also, but I didn't optimize it and thus it 
saves out almost everything of that:
martin@shambala:~> free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          1518       1219        298          0          0        831
-/+ buffers/cache:        388       1130
Swap:         1908          0       1908
Probably should limit that.
I would like suspend2 getting merged! Its proven technology and just 
works, while I couldn't get userspace software suspend to work for me. 
Maybe I made a mistake while setting it up, but I think setting it up at 
first shouldn't be that complicated than I perceived it to be.
I use suspend2 for our workstations at work, too, and my workstation has a 
uptime of more than 43 days with more than 17 successful suspend and 
resume cycles.
Regards,
