The ADM8211 would be a good test too. So far, the main thing I see missing 
from the 802.11 code is software scanning/authentication/association. Is all 
of that being moved to userspace? I prefer having a little bit of that in the 
kernel so minimal managed, adhoc, and WEP features can be used without a 
daemon.
