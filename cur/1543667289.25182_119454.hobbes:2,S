Hi,
  any hope that promise 20265 driver could detect non-udma66 cable
and run at udma2 only? BIOS properly detect this, but Linux driver
wants to use udma100, and usually dies hard with CRC errors during
reading of PTBL extended chain (it also should not lockup when
CRC error happens 5 times in a row, but ...).
