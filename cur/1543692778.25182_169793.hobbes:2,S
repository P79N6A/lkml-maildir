yup.
Why is it not sufficient to do something like:
	if (!(error_code & 4) && is_prefetch(...))
		return;
near the start of do_page_fault()?
kernel-mode faults aren't very common.  Most of them occur in
generic_file_read(), for reads into freshly-allocated memory (I think). 
And the frequency of these is limited by disk bandwidth...
