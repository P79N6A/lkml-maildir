The original OCFS was intended for use with pfiles and control files but
very definitely *not* software (the ORACLE_HOME).  It was not remotely
general purpose.  It also predated ASM by about a year or so, and the
two solutions are complementary.  Either one is a good choice for Oracle
datafiles, depending upon your needs.

Too many to mention here, but let's just say that some of the largest
databases are running Oracle datafiles on top of OCFS1.  Very large
companies with very important data.

Yeah you should definitely update your blog ;-)  If you need named
references, we can give you loads of those.
