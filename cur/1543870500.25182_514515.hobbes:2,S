Hi,
I have experienced kernel OOPS in sysfs_readdir. Below is some
information about kernel version, debugging, some other reports of
OOPS. At the end of the mail I am attaching OOPS.
I also have kernel dump via which I could traverse sysfs_dirent list,
and also see dentry. (Analysis is in #4).
I could not figure out how that happen, just by reading code as most
of the things are under inode lock. But there could be some race which
is causing this crash.
#########################################################
1) SMP box with 4GB physical memory.
2) kernel is 2.6.9-34-EL (CentOS)
NOTE: I know its old kernel. But I've compared fs/sysfs code from that
kernel to latest and code had not been changed fundamentally.
Especially OOPS I've got, is very similar to other people have
reported and that portion of code had not been changed.
3) Digging archive, I've found following to threads which reports
similar issue. (Esepcially 2nd link). Though fixes commited for those
problems still not clerify situation I have encountered.

4) Debugging: (Oops message at the end.. And if needed, I can provide
kernel dump files)
EIP:    0060:[<e01a40c9>]
Code arround EIP is
0xe01a40b7 :   movl   %ecx,0x14(%esp,1)
0xe01a40bb :   movl   0x20(%esi),%eax
0xe01a40be :   testl  %eax,%eax
0xe01a40c0 :   je     0xe01a41e8 <sysfs_readdir+504>
0xe01a40c6 :   movl   0x10(%eax),%eax
0xe01a40c9 :   movl   0x18(%eax),%edx <----------------------Crashed Here.
Now, If i traverse sysfs_dirent from 'struct file *', I see following..
struct file *filep = ed6e7280;
And sysfs_dirent are....
1) 0xf7ddbbc0
2) 0xf7d6b100
3) 0xf7d6cc88
4) 0xf7d6fe80
1, 2 and 4 all have count = 1.
 'esi' = 0xf7d6b100  which is pointer to the sysfs_dirent
>> p *(struct sysfs_dirent *)0xf7d6b100
struct sysfs_dirent {
        s_count = atomic_t {
                counter = 1
        }
        s_sibling = struct list_head {
                next = 0xf7d6cc8c
                prev = 0xf7ddbbc4
        }
        s_children = struct list_head {
                next = 0xf7d6b10c
                prev = 0xf7d6b10c
        }
        s_element = 0xf76ed280
        s_type = 32
        s_mode = 41471
        s_dentry = (nil)        <----------------------------------
This is null....
}
But disass of sysfs_readdir(), shows that this is not possible
otherwise 'testl' would be true and it should have jumped to
sysfs_readdir() + 504 address. But testl succeeded, Not only that, we
dereference that pointer and got d_inode
#### Code #####
if (next->s_dentry)
   ino = next->s_dentry->d_inode->i_ino
but then while accessing d_inode (to get i_ino), it crashed.
That means, at one point s_dentry was NON-NULL. And next memonet it
became NULL and its inode has gone, causing this OOPS.
5) OOPS messages from console.
