These are patches that guilt imported from email messages.  It didn't
strip the headers and I didn't care to.  I'll try to in the future, it
isn't a big deal.

No, but it's coming.  I'd like to have some robust documentation so that
Ulrich can help me understand what more he'd need to support POSIX AIO
with syslets from glibc.

Yes.  Each blocking operation has a thread that is performing the
operation synchronously.  The benefit is that the thread is only created
if the operation blocks.  If it doesn't block then it's a normal system
call invocation.  You don't have to manage threads and communicate the
arguments and results of system calls amongst threads for the case where
it never blocks.

No, every blocking point is considered a scheduling point.

I'm not sure what exactly you mean by kernel mode fibers (I can guess,
but I'd rather not).  From the answer of to the last question, though,
I'm going to guess that it might not be the most apt characterization.
