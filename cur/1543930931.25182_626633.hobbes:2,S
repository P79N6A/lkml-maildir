What good does using multiple levels of RNG do?  Why seed one RNG from 
another?  Wouldn't it be better to have just one RNG that everybody 
uses?  Doesn't the act of reading from the RNG add entropy to it, since 
no one reader has any idea how often and at what times other readers are 
stirring the pool?
