As far as I understand, loadavg reports the average number of
processes in the TASK_RUNNING state.
What happens in my driver, I believe, is that :
- on timer interrupt, I do some stuff, and wake_up the waiting process
- then the loadavg is computed (seeing my waiting task as TASK_RUNNING)
- then the scheduler runs the task
- then the task goes immediatly back to sleep
>From this point of view, then my problem is just "cosmetic". Isn't
there a way to do things in a different order, so that I could still
get a meaningful(*) loadavg ?
(*): by meaningful, I mean representing the number of busy processes
at a random point in time.
