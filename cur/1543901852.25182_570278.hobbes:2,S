why would it not be possible?

so let's act as if ACPI doesn't exist and make a suspend-to-disk that 
works without it and looks to ACPI like a complete power off/on cycle (but 
looks to the user like a suspend/resume cycle)
this should avoid all the headaches about ACPI completely becouse you just 
don't make any ACPI calls at all.
this will also work on any type of system, and it will work in the 
presence of dead batteries, failed components, booting other OS's, moveing 
the image to different hardware, etc.
I can't think of anything much more frustrating then thinking that I 
suspended a system and then discovering that becouse the battery went dead 
(a complete power loss) that the system wouldn't boot up properly. to me 
this would be a fairly common condition (when I'm mobile I use the machine 
until I am out of battery, then stop and it may be a long time (days) 
before I can charge the thing up again) this would not be a reliable 
suspend as far as I'm concerned.
for suspend-to-ram you have to worry about ACPI states and what you are 
doing with them, for suspend-to-disk you can ignore them and completely 
power the system off instead.
