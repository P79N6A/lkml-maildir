1fbbac4bcb03033d325c71fc7273aa0b9c1d9a03 is first bad commit

    [SERIAL] serial_cs: convert multi-port table to quirk table
    - rename multi_id table to serial_quirk / quirks[]
    - use named initialisers
    - store a pointer to the quirk table in the serial_info structure
      so we can use the quirk table entry later.
    - apply multi-port quirk after the multi-port guessing code,
      but only if it's != -1.

(if there is no time, don't sleep:)
First feeling: unrelatet. But if i compile 2.6.19-rc4 without cardbus support, 
the laptop boots on_battery and with lapic!
Need first a little sleep....
Thanks
