	You could create a new module based on hdlc_ppp.c, changing the
following line in hdlc_ppp_ioctl():
dev->hard_start_xmit = hdlc->xmit;
	to:
dev->hard_start_xmit = my_new_xmit;
	Then you implement my_new_xmit() that adds the encapsulation and
calls hdlc->xmit() at the end.
	See also hdlc_raw_eth.c on 2.6. It does exactly this.
