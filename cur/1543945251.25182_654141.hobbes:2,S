The thinkpad DSDT exports two acpi video nodes, but only one is active.
Apparently, ACPI video chose the wrong one.  You did the test by booting
directly to single user mode (without X loading at all since the last
reboot), correct?  That means there is a bug to report, indeed.
Please report it through 
http://buzilla.kernel.org
, as that's the preferred
method of bug reporting by the ACPI people.
