This issue is of particular interest to us, from the IBM Power toolchain 
perspective.
Ingo, do you think it would be feasible to add an ability to open a 
single file descriptor that could give global counting (and sampling) on 
all CPU's?  I realize this would entail creating a context per cpu in 
the kernel.
How to present the count data back to user space is another issue.  For 
example, do you sum the counts of a particular event type across all 
CPUs or do you keep them separate, and have the user space app read them 
up per-cpu  (perhaps not knowing exactly which cpu they come from)?
I realize that perfmon doesn't have this ability either, it's currently 
per-cpu as well for global counting.
But it seems as long as you are going so far as providing a thread 
inheritance feature (which I assume uses a summing approach for 
providing counts back to user space), that this "pan-cpu" counting 
feature might not be too difficult to implement.  It sure would simplify 
the life of user space apps, as Andi said.
