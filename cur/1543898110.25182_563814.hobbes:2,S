Invalidate. Sorry didn't realise it they hadn't discovered that word down
under.
If you've got something packing objects in tight we are going
to have fun with cache handling simply because the CPU cache granularity
may mean that the invalidate also invalidates a few bytes on (ie a 12
byte object will invalidate 16 bytes of memory) and you've just removed
any CPU held changes in the start of the next object.
