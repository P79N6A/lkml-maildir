hm.  Is the hardware known to be good?

That's because you've enabled CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.  It enormously
increases the size of slab objects, which seems to cause memory reclaim to
blow up.  (It shouldn't but it does.  It's a low-priority problem though).
It's unlikely that the oom-killing caused the oops, but it's possible I
guess.  There's supposed to be a dump_stack() in the out_of_memory() path,
which would help in searching for bugs, but that seems to have got lost.
