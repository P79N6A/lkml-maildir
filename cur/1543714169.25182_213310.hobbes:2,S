Oops... your fix is obviously correct.
I assumed that the test was to check if the caller is a thread, but that sounds 
odd -- wouldn't it stop being a thread after the exec anyway?  Maybe that part 
happens after compute_creds, so this prevents a race?  Although I don't see how 
it could be triggered if the thread never entered usermode before getting a new 
fs/files/sighand.
Anyone?
