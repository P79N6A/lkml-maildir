What do you consider an order mismatch?  I would like to see this:
spin_lockirq
spin_unlock
restore_irq
go away.  I.e. xx_lockirq should be paired with xx_unlockirq.  If
exceptions are needed, we should provide macros that explicitly do this
such as:
spin_unlock_leaveirq_off
or some such.
Of course, all this is predicated on using the lock macros in a
different way than intended.  For example, preemption currently counts
up on spin_lock and disable irq, counting the spin_lockirq twice.  In
fact, it need only count it once, if the locks are properly paired.  It
might also be nice to have a set of lock routines that make explicit the
assumptions made.  For example:
read_lock_irq_assumed_off  or
read_lockirq_assumed_on  (used instead of saveirq based on the
assumption)
These locks could then have optional debug code that tested the
assumption.
If we got all of this clean enough, we would know when we were locking
with irq off and the preemption patch, for example, would not need to
count the spinlock at all, but just the irq.  (Oh, and since the irq
inhibits preemption all by itself, we don't need to count it either.)

Run time checks for xxx_irq when irq is already off seem reasonable. 
The implication is that the xxx_unlockirq will then turn it on, which
most likely is an error.  Also, see above about rolling assumptions in
to the macro name.
