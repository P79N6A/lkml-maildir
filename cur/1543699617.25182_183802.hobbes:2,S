Subject: memory leak related to bridging, conntrack and frags in 2.6.0

Sorry for the cross-post - I thought this would be of interest to all the 
lists and also wasn't sure where the best people to help hang out.
With both conntrack and bridging turned on in the 2.6.0test11 kernel, 
sending fragmented packets over the bridge reveals a memory leak 
(specifically, forwarding packets from any interface to a bridge).  The 
memory that is leaking seems to be being allocated on line 299 on 
net/bridge/br_netfilter.c:
        if ((nf_bridge = nf_bridge_alloc(skb)) == NULL)
                return NF_DROP;
  
Only the first fragment gets freed later on.
The patch attached fixes the problem by freeing nf_bridge when the 
packets are defragmented, however I am sure this is not the right place 
to do this.  Where would the skb's for the fragments usually get freed?
