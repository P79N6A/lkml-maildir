Often the people testing are only doing just that, testing. So they
kindly offer to test any patches and so on, which usually takes forever
because of the above limitations in response time, machine availability,
etc.
Writing a small test module to exercise slub/slab in various ways
(allocating from all cpus freeing from one, as described) should not be
too hard. Perhaps that would be enough to find this performance
discrepancy between slab and slub?
