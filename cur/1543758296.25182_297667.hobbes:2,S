What is all this stuff for? Unless you are doing some pretty bizarre 
things in your module this is far more complex than it needs to be. See:

Given your previous posts on this issue I can't help but think you'd be 
better off reading how this can be done simply, rather than whining 
about the "political correctness" of the build process..
