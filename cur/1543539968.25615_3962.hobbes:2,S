What chipset is on you motherboard?
The AMD 750 (Irongate) only supports 768M.
The Via KX/KT 133 may support mor, check their website.
Also check the board maker's site, just because
the chipset can handle more memory, the board
may not be built to do so. Like chipset says
4x256M = 1G, only has 3 slots, but
2x512M won't work so boaw has max of 768M.
