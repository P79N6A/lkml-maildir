I like the concept, I would have done it different though: I would look
at the bits and see if a user can do anything with a file. Can
he/she (from now on I'll write 'xe' for that) read or write or execute a
file (or is owner of course)? -> file is visible. Xe is in group of file?
And Xe can r/w/x file? -> visible. all other cases: invisible.
