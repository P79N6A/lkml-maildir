1.  Add to the end of rc the commands to copy the logs to floppy or anywhere.
2.  Add to the end of inittab a call, using :once:, to a script to copy the 
logs to floppy or anywhere.
3.  Write a daemon that mirrors the logs from time to time to floppy or 
anywhere, lauched from inittab or from whatever launches your daemons.
