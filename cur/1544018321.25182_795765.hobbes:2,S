I have tried my old Trancend 64Mb, RamStar 521Mb and NCP 64Mb cards. My old 
cards returned right id[ATA_ID_CONFIG] = 0x848A.
But I have to use Kingston CF Card 1Gb 2008.
ata_id_is_cfa() returns 0 for it and
id[ATA_ID_MAJOR_VER]	= 0
id[ATA_ID_CONFIG]		= 0x044A
I have only CF+ specification revision 2.0, but I've found in wiki:
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompactFlash#CF.2B_specification_revisions
)
"... While the current revision 4.1 from 2004 works only in ATA mode, ..."
So I have reached an impasse. How to identify modern CF cards?
