What partitions are used to make /dev/md1?

All my use of lilo and RAID is with boot=/dev/hda.
I guess the above should work if the system is setup to look for a boot 
record on /dev/hda1 (or whichever is the name of a part of the RAID-1 mirror) 
by having it marked active and having the Debian MBR, the DOS "fdisk /mbr" or 
something similar.  But why would you want to?  Is the aim of this to enable 
swapping /dev/hda and /dev/hdc (or whichever drives comprise the RAID-1) 
without re-running LILO?

From Manual.txt.gz:
   LI   The first stage boot loader was able to load the second stage boot
    loader, but has failed to execute it. This can either be caused by a
    geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/boot.b without running the map
    installer.
   LIL-   The descriptor table is corrupt. This can either be caused by a
    geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/map without running the map
    installer.
The error "LI" is easy to cause.  Just do mv /boot/boot.b.backup /boot/boot.b 
...
As for "LIL-".  Are you sure that everything is fine with your geometry?  
Maybe your BIOS and the kernel have different ideas about how things are 
supposed to be?  I imagine that you installed a newer kernel etc at the time 
of your upgrade from Red Hat to Debian so this could be a partial cause.

I'll leave that for John to answer.
