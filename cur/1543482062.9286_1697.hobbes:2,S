Fine.  If your disk hardware tells the host that it has completed an
update to oxide and the update is still volatile, you have a broken
disk: send it back.  No enterprise-class databases support such
hardware.  For writeback caching to be supported, the cache _must_ be
battery-backed or (in advanced multi-controller redundant storage
cabinets) multipowered and multiported.  That is a fundamental storage
architecture issue, nothing at all to do with the host O/S.

Not on ANY decent storage systems.
