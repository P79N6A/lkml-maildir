Hi all,
I've been having trouble with my Radeon card not working with X.
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 AS [Radeon 
9550]
The only thing I can find that may be a clue is:
Jun 17 11:12:48 raven kernel: agpgart: Detected AGP bridge 0
Jun 17 11:12:48 raven kernel: agpgart: unable to get memory for graphics 
translation table.
Jun 17 11:12:48 raven kernel: agpgart: agp_backend_initialize() failed.
Jun 17 11:12:48 raven kernel: agpgart-amd64: probe of 0000:00:00.0 failed 
with error -12
in the messages file.
I've seen this on a number of 2.6.17-rc kernels and just now on FC6 kernel 
2.6.16-1..2289_FC6 which, from the changelog is quite recent:
* Thu Jun 15 2006 Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
- 2.6.17-rc6-git7
Anyone have any suggestions or ideas on this?
Ian
