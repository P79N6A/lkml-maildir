Actually, looking closer at the code, the patch seems to add _incorrect_ 
error handling.
For example, look at bd_claim_by_kobject(): if the "bd_claim()" inside of 
it succeeds, we used to always return success. Now, we don't necessarily 
do that: we may have done a _successful_ "bd_claim()" call, but then we 
return an error because something else failed, and now we're returning 
with from bd_claim_by_kobject() with the bd_claim() done, but with an 
error return (so the caller will _not_ call "bd_release()", and the 
block_device will forever stay exclusive).
No?
Now, exactly why acpi stops working as a result, I don't know, but maybe 
something else tries to get exclusive access to a swap partition, for 
example, and now fails, causing some acpi sequence to not be set up? 
Dunno.
So I suspect it should be reverted, but maybe somebody can see exactly 
what goes wrong here.
