No, you're not confused.  Someone did mention that dhcpcd was
playing up.
Obviously, something changed between 2.2.14 and more current
kernels which broke pump.  I don't believe it's a driver change
because it also affects the 3c90x driver.  I don't have a theory
as to why this affects the 3com NICs though.  But I'm assuming
that whatever broke pump also broke dhcpcd.
I note that with 3c59x in 2.4.0, pump-0.7.3 basically freezes up.
It spits out a single bootp packet then goes to lunch.  I got
bored waiting after ten minutes. So an upgrade is definitely needed.
