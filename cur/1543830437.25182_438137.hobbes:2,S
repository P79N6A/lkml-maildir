Actually the change you proposed works on my system. A 2.6.10 with
the ATA_FLAG_SATA_RESET works.  I did the same to a 2.6.16 kernel
but there it didn't work. I guess something else was introduced
between 2.6.10 and 2.6.16.  I'll start recompiling again everything
from 2.6.10 up to 2.6.16 with that flag turned on to see where it
stops working again.
