x86.git randconfig testing found the following new build error in latest 
-git:
 drivers/built-in.o: In function `v4l2_i2c_drv_attach_legacy':
 tuner-core.c:(.text+0x1a829d): undefined reference to `v4l2_i2c_attach'
 drivers/built-in.o: In function `tuner_command':
 tuner-core.c:(.text+0x1a971c): undefined reference to `v4l_printk_ioctl'
the reason appears to be that the TEA5761/TEA5767 tuner code is 
dependent on (legacy?) V4L infrastructure like v4l2_i2c_attach, by 
virtue of drivers/media/video/tuner-core.c including 
media/v4l2-i2c-drv-legacy.h and ./sound/i2c/other/Makefile doing:
  snd-tea575x-tuner-objs := tea575x-tuner.o
for now i solved this via adding a VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON dependency to 
MEDIA_TUNER - which solves the build problem by excluding these drivers 
- but i suspect there might be a better fix as well that does not 
restrict the selectability of these drivers.
