Close enough... Actual reason is the implementation of MINOR().

I thought about the rgooch's suggestion, it sounds good for 2.5.
Red Hat do not ship devfs enabled currently, and I cannot use his
allocation function if someone uses static majors, or some modules
may not load. The patch does include a safety element (majorhog_xxx)
that reserves majors properly. The devfs would make that unnecessary.
