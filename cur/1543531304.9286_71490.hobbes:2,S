I don't have the power to nod, however ...

Everyone using net_init to allocate the net_device struct gets a dev->name
pointing to IFNAMSIZ bytes. So there are more than 4 that do this right
(3c59x, eepro100, 8139too, pcnet32, via-rhine, and a few others that do
 dev = init_etherdev(NULL/0, *) in 2.3.99-pre2)
(But I don't understand your number of 27 that needs fixing, so maybe I'm 
 way off here ... :)
When using init_etherdev they also get their device private area aligned
to 32 bytes (should perhaps be adjustable with an extra argument), and all
this becomes one chunk that the driver needs to kfree at the end (a few
I've looked at don't seem to kfree what they kmalloc).
Maybe a correct fix would be to have all drivers/net create their 'dev'
struct the same way ... and init_etherdev looks like a good candidate.
The FIXME at the top of Space.c seems to agree.

Yes. I don't see the point of having a char* if it is always pointing to
the same char[] (as it would using init_etherdev).
