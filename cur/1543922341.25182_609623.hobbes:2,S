Before reviewing the details of the proposed workaround, I'd like to see
a deeper analysis of the problem to see that there isn't a cleaner way
to resolve this.
For example:
Question) What are the realistic situations we must support that lead to
a resize during table reload with I/O outstanding?
- The resize is the purpose of the reload; noflush is only set to avoid losing
I/O if a path should fail.  So any outstanding I/O may be expected to be
consistent with both the old and new sizes of the device.  E.g. If it's
beyond the end of a shrinking device and userspace cared about not
losing that I/O, it would have waited for that I/O to be flushed
*before* issuing the resize.  If the I/O is beyond the end of the
existing device but within the new size, userspace would have waited for
the resize operation to complete before allowing the new I/O to be
issued.
=> Is it OK for device-mapper to handle the device size check
internally, rejecting any I/O that falls beyond the end of the table (it
already must do this lookup anyway), and to update the size recorded in
the inode later, after I/O is flowing through the device again, but (of
course) before reporting that the resize operation is complete?
I.e. does it eliminate deadlocks if the bdget() and i_size_write()
happen after the 'resume'?
