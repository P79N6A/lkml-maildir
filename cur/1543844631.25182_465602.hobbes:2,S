This is what Altix did for a long time (and it looks like it still sets 
MAX_DMA_ADDRESS to the top of addressable memory).

AFAIK ZONE_DMA was created for crappy ISA devices that could only DMA to 
low addresses.  As various architectures were added, they either 
misunderstood its purpose, abused it for their own purposes, or ignored it 
in some way as it didn't really apply.

If you have a decent enough IOMMU both or either could cover all of memory.  
In the case of an Altix, the IOMMU is 32 bit capable, so it would make 
sense for ZONE_DMA32 to contain all of memory...
But anyway, I agree with your broader point that we really need a different 
allocator for this stuff.  It has to be arch specific in some way though, 
so we can take into account the advantages IOMMUs provide.  I think jejb 
said he'd come up with a sample implementation a couple of years ago... :)
From a portability and definition perspective, I'd contend that ZONE_DMA 
and ZONE_DMA32 are both broken.  Only ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_HIGHMEM have 
sane definitions it seems.
