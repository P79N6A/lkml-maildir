Even if it did it would at best be a toy. The core IDE layer doesn't
handle SCSI errors properly (needed for ATAPI) except using ide-scsi. It
doesn't handle hot plugging of devices, it doesn't handle tagged
queueing very well, it hasn't the slightest idea about multipath (SATA2
can do), it doesn't know a lot of other things either.
SATA and especially SATA2 is basically SCSI with some slightly odd ways
of issuing READ10/WRITE10 to disk devices. A "native" driver would
basically be a copy of most of drivers/scsi.
I actually think thats a positive thing. It means 2.5 drivers/scsi is
now very close to being the "native queueing driver" with some
additional default plugins for doing scsi scanning, scsi error recovery 
and a few other scsi bits.
