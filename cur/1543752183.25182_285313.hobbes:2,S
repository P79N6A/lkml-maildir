Prarit,
I run 2.4.27 on all my machines.
Never had problems but this (if we want to say its not a disk problem)
I have seen on mailing lists many people having this very problem, 
always on hdb, with a lot of different kernel and machines.
I have basically two kind of cabinets:
- The 'Antec style' tower
- Racmount cases
Everything well cooled...i am sure bout that.
Always ASUS A7V, Athlon XP 2xxx+, NEVER OVERCLOCKED, of course...
Disks are mainly Maxtor, or IBM
Basically i was wondering whether to swap disks on a server just to try....
....These are the things that rave me mad !
