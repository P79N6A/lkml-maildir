Jozsef,
Amazing! You fixed it. No more 'invalid packed ignored', and speed back to 
normal (continues after approx. 20 seconds of pausing after 503 prints).
I used the latest git, and have to modify your patch slightly to make it 
work (changing "conntrack" to "ct").
Thank you for fixing this.
Jeff
Here's your patch modified so it'll apply to the latest git.
