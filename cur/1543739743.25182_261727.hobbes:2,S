they are racy on SMP. It does:
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	schedule();
which is almost always a bug to go to sleep via sleep_on() _after_
checking for the condition, because the following could happen:
	CPU1				CPU2
	if (condition)
		goto done;
					wake_up(&waitqueue);
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	schedule();
The proper interface is wait_event() (and variants).
your patch probably only works due to timing - the wakeup always happens
after sleep_on() has been called.
this particular NFS case is probably only correct due to userspace
behavior. The code is apparently relying on the wake_up() never
happening _before_ we do the sleep_on().
so, could you try the init_MUTEX_LOCKED() fix plus the patch below -
does that turn off the deadlock assert? (Plus also uncomment the
RWSEM_BUG() around line 130.)
