Could be a VM bug. ;)
There are a few VM bugs in test9-pre7; however I think I've
fixed them. If my test box survives an hour of heavy stress
testing I'll post the patch here...
(that'll be in half an hour)
Then of course there's the issue that the new VM may not
work correctly with journaling filesystems because of
independant page aging and page flushing conflicting
with the write ordering constraints reiserfs has.
However, that should (because of kupdate/kflushd) only
result in somewhat longer system stalls and a lot of kswapd
cpu usage, and only in situations where system activity is
very heavy and very strange...
regards,
Rik
