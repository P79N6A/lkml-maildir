Whilst waiting for the local fs tests to finish/progress I did
a quick test with nfs. It dies after a while with an io error.
You can skip over the boring part and go straight to the interesting
failure case by using the options -c1234 -b 48870
Should happen quite quickly after that.
Full log of the failcase is at

Dave.
