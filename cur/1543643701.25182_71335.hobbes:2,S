But it did read the first 8 blocks off the devices when it
read the partition, the usb debug showed:
usb-storage: Command READ_10 (10 bytes)
usb-storage: 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 00 30 da
With offsets starting at 0 -
Bytes 2 - 5 are the logical block address, all 0.
Bytes 7 - 8 are the transfer length  - 8 blocks.
The last two bytes are junk.
You should be able to run the equivalent:
	dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/zero bs=512 count=8
And, look in dmesg for the failure message of the first read that fails, it
could have set the device offline.
