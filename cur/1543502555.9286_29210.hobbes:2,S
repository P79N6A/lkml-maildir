Subject: latest raid0145 with 2.2.10-ac10???

Hello gurus,
I've heard rumors that the latest AC kernel (ac10) may solve the last
nagging bugs (attempt to access beyond end of device...), or so says SCT.
Now, I'm running a raid0 array under 2.2.10 that is struck by this bug
every week or so, except that in the raid0 case, it used to cause an oops
(raid0_map is called before the check for out of range request - until I
put a check for that).
I would like to try the raid patches against the AC10 kernel, but there
are *far* too many serious conflicts.  For example, the lvm.c stuff... and
some fs/buffer.c changes.
Is there any hope of getting help with this?  Or should I patiently wait
for Linus to merge the applicable bits of AC10 into 2.2.11 and then
patiently wait for the next raid0145 patch?  I'm a bit impatient, as this
is the only thing that keeps my system from running PERFECTLY!
Of course, as always, thanks for the tremendously good work, and please
don't construe this as complaining!
David
P.S. if the rumors (rumours for you Alan...) of the fix are correct, can
they be cleanly extracted into a fly-by-night patch to 2.2.10? i.e is it
as simple as applying the fs/buffer.c stuff from AC10?
