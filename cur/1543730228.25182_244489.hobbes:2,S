Thanks.  This source has some problems.  When compiling, I get multiple
errors regarding PCI_DEVICE_ID_BCM4713 being undefined:
/root/b44/b44.c:94: error: `PCI_DEVICE_ID_BCM4713' undeclared here (not in a function)
etc  Is this missing a header file or some other update?
In order to try to get it to compile, I removed the PCI table entry for
the BCM4713 and made every conditional that depends on it false (by
removing the appropriate code).  However, when trying to ifconfig the
interface I get:
	SIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot allocate memory
	SIOCSIFFLAGS: Cannot allocate memory

The Broadcom Linux driver version 3.0.7 also locks up on me, but it
doesn't support "ethtool -A", so I have to stop and start the interface
completely to get it working again.

Nope.  512MB RAM.
