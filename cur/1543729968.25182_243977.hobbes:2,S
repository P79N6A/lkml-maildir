Here is the very original linux-kernel mailing list, and if I cannot find an
answer here, then nowhere on earth can this answer be found. I also saw some
other messages regarding the same issue on the net. None of them is answered
correctly; and also as if this is a very "forbidden" thing to disable the
checksums, most replies are as if they are "unbreakable rules of god".
Really, I am losing my patience with this. It is also very odd to write a
low-level application in order to just disable a "feature" of the kernel to
deal with a faulty piece of embedded firmware.

He already stated that he was dealing with a very expensive, very broken
piece of hardware, and he needs a way to work around it.  Many of us
have been in this situation, I will not name names ;-).  Telling him to
just replace it is not helpful.
