Hello,
I´m trying to use the Multicast IP in linux-2.4.7-ac11 but it doesnot work...
I already added IP Multicasting in the kernel and I configured the route :
route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev atm0.
The error message is "setsockopt - IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP: No such device".
Could You help me?
Thanks.
Mercia
