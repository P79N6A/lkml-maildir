Looking at related code, sys_sendfile64 a few lines down.
	if (unlikely(copy_from_user(&pos, offset, sizeof(loff_t))))
		return -EFAULT;
	if (unlikely(put_user(pos, offset)))
		return -EFAULT;
It seems odd that put_user() is used to write an 8-byte value, but
get_user() cannot be used read one.  I looked in <asm-i386/uaccess.h>
and indeed the asymmetry is there.
Is there a reason why put_user() supports 1/2/4/8 bytes and get_user()
supports only 1/2/4 bytes?
