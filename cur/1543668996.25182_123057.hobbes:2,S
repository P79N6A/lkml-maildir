not sure why you want still to have the vm to know about the
mmap(VM_NONLINEAR) hack at all.
that's a vm bypass. I can bet the people who wants to use it for running
faster on the the 32bit archs will definitely prefer zero overhead and
full hardware speed with only the pagetable and tlb flushing trash, and
zero additional kernel internal overhead. that's just a vm bypass that
could otherwise sit in kernel module, not a real kernel API.
