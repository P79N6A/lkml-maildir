manner as others can.
So whats wrong with this message that its filtered?

Oliver:
Sort of late, but,
I have a couple of kernels building with this patch applied, one with the 
sd-0.48 patch where FTDI stuff is a 40+% cpu hog and can't be used, and one 
with the cfs-v10 patch where it can be co-erced into working if I screw with 
it enough.
I have also been using another serial patch that for unk reasons, also helps 
the usb-serial case here, but vger won't let me repost that without stripping 
off the headers.  That patch has some resemblance to 
this:8250-clear-on-read-bits-LSR-MSR where I usually replace spaces with 
dashes so I don't have to use "to surround the name" in my scripts.
So these test kernels will have both patches.
I'll let you know how they work later this morning.
