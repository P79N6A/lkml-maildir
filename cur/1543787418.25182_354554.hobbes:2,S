Please don't. The warning is entirely warranted, as far as I can tell.
Shutting up warnings just because they are warnings is bad practice. 
Either fix them, or leave them be.
If you do an "ioremap()", then the result is a "(void __iomem *)". If you 
assign it to something that is "unsigned long", you _should_ get a 
warning.
