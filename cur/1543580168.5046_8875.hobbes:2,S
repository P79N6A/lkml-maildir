Subject: [uPATCH] make drivers/scsi/eata.c call pci_enable_device before rs. probing (241p11)

Hi.
The following patch makes drivers/scsi/eata.c wait with probing
pci resources until we have called pci_enable_device. This is recommended
due to hot-plug considerations (according to Jeff Garzik).
It applies against ac12 and 241p11.
