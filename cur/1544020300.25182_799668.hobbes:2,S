So, what's this all about?
You know, if there's something that is relevant to others and you want to
_add_ them to the CC, at least leave enough of the original message so the
new people who are being CC'd have some clue what the hell the thread is 
about, and more importantly where to get the patches being discussed.
Until then, if this includes any ARM bits, NAK, because I don't know
what those changes are.
