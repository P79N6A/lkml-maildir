Thanks Mark.  Is there also a way to do it with both as modules,
say something like:
[conf.modules]
options -k cdrom hdc=/dev/hdd
options -k ide-scsi=/dev/hdc
??
If not, I can build them in, but I'd rather use modules if
possible, since the CDROM is only used occasionally, and the
ide-scsi only needed for burns.
Thanks again.
