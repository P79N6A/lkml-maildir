Subject: 2.4.21-rc7 hang on boot after spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ15.

Doing swsusp testing in endless loop. On a P4/2.4G (ACPI=off)
on 192nd boot:
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ15.
Calibrating delay loop... 
 hang
Hit Reset and it rebooted OK
This is the first spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ15 seen.
I see spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7 quite frequently on
varying hardware on both 2.4 and 2.5.
By design, the 8259A delivers a vector 7 when the IRQ
line is deasserted before the IRQ is serviced. This
applies to both edge and level trigger modes. A floating
"wire" or crapy chipset can pickup noise, but the driver 
should handle it.  
No problems seen with mainboard/cpu/ram in three months. 
I dont' think it is HW, but it could be.  
Also, spurious 8259A interrupts are quite recent, could 
something be wrong with recent 8259A driver?

Michael
