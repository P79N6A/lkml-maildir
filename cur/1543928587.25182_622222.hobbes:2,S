No, it's safe to set ktype after kobject_init, it was just not safe to
set the kset.  As Kay pointed out, I just added a patch to my tree to
resolve this issue, and I'll go back and update the documentation now.
I do like the "check for a ktype" warning, I'll go add that to my local
tree and see what breaks.  Odds are, all the static kobjects will :(
thanks,
