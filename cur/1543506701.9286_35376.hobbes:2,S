Subject: Re: ISSUE: Writing to mmap creates duplicate pages in 2.2.5 and 2.2.11 kernels

Some additional data points:
The duplication only occurs if O_APPEND is in effect.
If the file is closed and reopened without O_APPEND,
or if the file is mapped via a second descriptor opened
without O_APPEND, there is no duplication.
This is with 2.2.12-final3 on RH6.0.
