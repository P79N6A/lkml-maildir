I believe that the original #2 is to be dropped, but that the patch Oleg
submitted in:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113681388600342&w=2
may be needed.  I have added Vatsa to the CC to get his take on this.
However, this patch should be independent from #4, so it should be OK
to apply an updated #4 first while we are working out what to do about #2.

Been there more times than I care to admit, and I most definitely agree!!!
