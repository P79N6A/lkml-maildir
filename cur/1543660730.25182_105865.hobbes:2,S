Each of these warnings reproduces for each input device on my system 
(there are 3 now, so if i disconnect, say, my USB mouse, there will be 
only 2.)
In other news (this happened in -mm5, not sure if this happened to 
others or not:)
Hangcheck: starting hangcheck timer 0.5.0 (tick is 180 seconds, margin 
is 60 seconds).
Uninitialised timer!
This is just a warning.  Your computer is OK
function=0xc0216100, data=0x0

No visible problems though, at all.
