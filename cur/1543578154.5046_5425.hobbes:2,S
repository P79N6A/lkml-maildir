	Hi!
I have switched a long time ago to linux-2.4 (and even 2.3 series) and I
have a wierd problem.
I use GRUB to boot my system. Basically, when you want to install GRUB on a
floppy disk, you do that:
dd if=stage1 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1
dd if=stage2 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 seek=1
But since kernel 2.3.xx (I don't remember exactly), I got this error
message when I try to do the second dd (even as root):
dd: advancing past 1 blocks in output file `/dev/fd0': Permission denied
And this thing works properly when under 2.2.xx...
I try to look a the diff of floppy.c between 2.2.18 and 2.4.0 but at this
time, I didn't find anything...

               everything else follows in the same way.
