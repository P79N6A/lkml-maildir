By doing:
 struct pps_ktime {
        __u64 sec;
-       __u32 nsec;
+       __u64 nsec;
 };
I got:
  GEN     .version
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o: In function `sys_time_pps_fetch':
(.text+0x5f05e): undefined reference to `__udivdi3'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
I suppose the problem is here:
                ticks = to.sec * HZ;
                ticks += to.nsec / (NSEC_PER_SEC / HZ);
Suggestions? :)
