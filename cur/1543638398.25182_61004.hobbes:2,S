The AMD SC-520 board uses a 128k BIOS ROM which is decoded
at 0xfffe0000. Of course the real BIOS  starts 1/2 way through
it at 0xffff0000. This gets shadowed to F000:0000 in 'real-mode'
as part of the boot sequence.
I want to re-program that BIOS PROM from a driver in Linux.
I find that ioremap_nocache(0xfffe0000, 0x00020000) seems to
'Work', i.e., returns some non-null cookie. However, I can't
access the BIOS ROM. I am accessing something, but it's something
in low memory, not the PROM that is quite identifiable.
/proc/iomem does not show my allocation and says, in fact, that
it's been 'reserved'. I can't understand such a 'reservation' because
I didn't reserve it and I wrote the BIOS.
fec00000-fec00fff : reserved
fee00000-fee00fff : reserved
ffff0000-ffffffff : reserved
Snippit from module init...
#define PROM_BASE 0xfffe0000
#define PROM_LEN  0x00020000 (also tried 0x0001ffff)
int __init init_module()
{
    int result;
    if((cp = (UC *) ioremap_nocache(PROM_BASE, PROM_LEN)) == NULL)
    {
        printk(KERN_ERR"%s : Can't access PROM\n", dev);
        return -EACCES;
    }
If I do:
        if(copy_to_user((UC *)arg, cp, PROM_LEN))
            return -EFAULT;
... as an ioctl() with the passed arg, and cp being the cookie from
ioremap_nocache()... This hangs (forever) with no panic(). If I
copy first to a kmalloc() buffer, then to the user, it goes okay,
but it's not the PROM image, it's something within the kernel's
RAM that I'm looking at.
Anybody got any hints? FYI, If I substitute other addresses, I can
access other PROMS including the Adaptec PROM in its controller
via PCI, plus the shadowed one in low RAM. Same with screen-card
BIOS. There seems to be something about the 0xfffe0000 address that
the kernel doesn't like.  Also, from user-mode, I can't mmap any
addresses above about 0xbfffffff. This may be part of the same problem.
Anybody have any idea?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
