We broke 2.6?  It'd be interesting to run the ls in an infinite loop on the
client them start poking at the server.  Is the 2.6 server doing physical
IO?  Is the 2.6 server consuming more system time?  etc.  A basic `vmstat
1' trace for both 2.4 and 2.6 would be a starting point.
Could be that there's some additional latency caused by networking changes,
too.  I expect the tcpdump/wireshark/etc traces would have sufficient
resolution for us to be able to see that.
