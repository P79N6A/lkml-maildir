Thats a reiserfs property and one you'll find in pretty much any other
fs.

Killing the process isnt neccessary, its been halted in its tracks. As to
a clean shutdown - no chance. You've just hit a disk failure, the on disk
state is not precisely known, writes have been lost. Nothing is going to
make a clean shutdown possible under such circumstances.
