The idea of opening files for read and opening files for execution is
bogus and you should fix the protocol, not add more crap to your
implementation.
There are two ways how you can implement security in network file system:
1. you expect that users have not root access on the client machine and
you check permissions on client (like in NFS). In this case the 'x' and
'r' bits are checked on the client and you don't have to care about them
in protocol. 
2. you expect that users have root access on client machine and you check
permissions on the server. In this case users can read executed files
anyway.

It seems that you are implementing case 2 of the above.
If you are checking permissions on server, read/execute have no security
meaning. Client can send 'execute' request and then store data somwhere to
file. Opening for 'execute' won't enhance your security.

Send always 'open for read' and ignore 'open for execute'.
And also remember that having file without read permission and with
execute permission makes sence only for suid programs. User can read the
file via /proc/<pid>/mem or attach debugger to the process...
