I couldn't agree more, Jon.
If we are to have a meaningful reviewed-by tag, it has to be clearly
documented as to what responsibilities it places on the reviewer. If
someone doesn't want to perform a well conducted review, then they
haven't earned the right to issue a Reviewed-by tag - they can use
the Acked-by rubber stamp instead.
FWIW, w.r.t. XFS patches, we already follow both the letter and
intent of your proposed reviewed-by tag for all changes to XFS code
and reviewers are currently listed as Signed-off-by in git-commits
(our internal SCM records the reviewer(s) and the git export script
converts that to s-o-b).  It would be much more meaningful if they
were exported as Reviewed-by under your definition....
IOWs, I fully support your definition of the Reviewed-by tag.
Cheers,
Dave.
