OK, well if they've been running for more than 6ms then AS goes out of
the picture, so no, shouldn't make a difference.
In general, on the read side, the disk scheduler can determine how
tasks get woken after waiting on reads, and on the write side its more
the request allocation. If CPU bound processes are running as well
though, then its a process scheduler decision about how soon a woken
process gets to run - I think IO performance wants this figure to be
nice and low.
