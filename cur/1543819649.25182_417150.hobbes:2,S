Here I'm talking about using SELinux to protect /etc/shadow both  
before _and_ after it's edited with vipw.  A tool like vipw does creat 
() write() rename() to overwrite the /etc/shadow file, so any SELinux  
system relying _only_ on inode is guaranteed to break.  In any case,  
the point here is to provide 2 clean semantics for protecting files:  
inodes and directory entries;  They have entirely different use- 
cases.  For an inode all you need is (<inode>), for a directory entry  
you need (<dir-inode>, <path-component>).  The latter would only be  
used when referencing the file by name, if you already have a  
filehandle it would not be used.

/etc/gshadow matters because it's the group shadow file, no?  If  
you're going to bother protecting the user shadow file, you should  
protect the group shadow file too.

True, but that's why I address the following 2 items below:

I _think_ SELinux provides a way to hook this, but I'm not entirely  
sure.  If not, it should be added, but I suspect it does.

Likewise, this should be solved with inode-based security if it's a  
problem.  The use-case I'm addressing (legitimate use of /etc/shadow  
with vipw) doesn't care about that.  For example, if I want to only  
allow vipw access to /etc/shadow, then associating that policy with  
the /etc/shadow inode is useless, because the first rogue program  
would just remove and rewrite /etc/shadow, getting a different  
inode.  What I need to do is protect the "shadow" entry in the dentry  
for ("/etc") in the particular namespace I care about, right?
