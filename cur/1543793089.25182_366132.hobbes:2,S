Something similar to that is included in my patch migration patchsets.
It will also allow you to selectively push pages in a range out. So it 
does something similar to hole punching.
For that you would scan over the range to be cleared and put the pages on 
a list using isolate_lru_page(). Then do whatever you need to with the 
pages. Push em out with migrate_pages(list, NULL) etc.
