OK.  But still, I don't see why we need partial BIO completions.  If
we say that the basic unit of completion is a whole BIO, then readahead
can then manage latency via the outgoing bio size.

Well I'd be interested in knowing specifically what is wrong with the
behaviour of 2.5.33 against a floppy disk.
In the testing I did a few weeks back, everything checked out.  An
application which was reading the raw device at 95% of media bandwidth
never blocked.  An application which was capable of processing data at
120% of media bandwidth achieved 100%.
It could be that the initial 64k read at the start-of-file is
too big, and the many-small-file behaviour is poor?
A specific "this sucks" testcase would be helpful...
