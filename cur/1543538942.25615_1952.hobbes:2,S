Until they prove it and I have an ata-analyser to observe the traces, I
will not believe them.  You know it is funny what you get to here and know
when you are a full voting member of NCITS-T13-AT-Attachemnt Standards
Committee.  I believe the folks that I work with on the committee.
I also asked WDC point blank about the issue, and got a NOP answer.
They know that all they have to do is call me on my cell and tehy will get
me.  So unless you are with WDC and will make a public counter statement
to the facts and submit proof, web-propaganda does not cut it for me.
Cheers,
