The Client OS knows the fs is busy, the server does not, so from the server 
side, I can change a file, unmount parts of the exported fs (nfs does not see 
fs boudries), or even mount a completely different fs on the exported fs, 
breaking the nfs client and the nfs server. Been there, done that. Yes, this 
is not userfriendly, but then again, NFS in not the best networked filesystem 
in the world, not was it designed to be handled by non-administrators.  (and I 
think it shouldn't have to be).
