I have reproduced this hang on 2.6.10-rc1-bk7, and have also installed the sysrq-n patch.  Even after "SysRq : Nice All RT Tasks",
the system is completely unresponsive as far as user mode is concerned, and will only react to SysRq.  It -does- respond to ICMP
pings.  Sysrq-e, -k, -i do not stop the offending tt1 process.
I do not have netdump available in 2.6.10-rc1-bk7, and so cannot provide a full sysrq-t output, but the visible section shows two
tt1 threads with identical stacks:
schedule_timeout+0xd0/0xd2
futex_wait+0x140/0x1a9
do_futex+0x33/0x78
sys_futex+0xcd/0xd9
sysenter_past_esp+0x52/0x71
I then tried running this task as non-root user, which should prevent SCHED_RR and PRIO changes of the threads/tasks.  Under these
conditions, the system does *not* hang.  I noticed that the app periodically ends up in a high-speed loop involving the
ACE_Semaphore class in ACE; having checked the compilation flags, it seems ACE is simulating semaphors using below calls.  It is
*not* using POSIX 1003.1b semaphores (sem_wait, etc.)
pthread_mutex_lock()
pthread_cond_wait()
pthread_cond_signal()
Although it appears I need to fix an applicaiton bug, is it normal/desirable for an application calling system mutex facilities to
starve the system so completely, and/or become "unkillable"?

Caveat:  This may be an infinite loop in a SCHED_RR process.  See very bottom of email for sysrq-t sysrq-p output.
