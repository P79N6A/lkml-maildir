ipc namespaces works (if you worry about tiny details like we put
the resource limits for the sysv ipc objects inside the namespace).
Probably the most instructive example of this is that you can you
map a sysv ipc shared memory segment with shmat and then switch to
another sysvipc namespace you still have access by reads and writes
to that shared memory segment but you cannot manipulate it because it
doesn't have a name.
Either that or look at the output of ipcs, before and after an unshare.
SYSVIPC really doesn't have it's own (very weird) set of global names
and that is essentially all the ipc namespace deals with.
I think you have the sysvipc namespace confused with something else
though (like signal sending).
