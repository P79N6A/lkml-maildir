Ok cool, regarding the ide-cd current problem, i still don't see how 
moving it to a BH would help in this case, the only difference i can see 
is that the ISR won't have to be so heavy and we can get more interrupt 
handling done (assuming the BH processing keeps up). The problem isn't 
that the read_intr is preempting other code and injecting already active 
requests into the queue, but that ide-cd is allowing running requests to 
be sent multiple times.
If you can just explain marginally a  possible workaround other than the 
kludge i diffed up i can try investigating further.
Thanks,
