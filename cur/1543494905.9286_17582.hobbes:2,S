Hello!

Certainly, it is OK. Only I do not believe that it is really
important yet, especially on client side.
I still think forward progress notifications may be done
only if a way to make it with zero cost exists, which is not true in the case.
At least theoretically, background arp made each 20 sec is better
than foreground notification on every transaction.
[ BTW my client really did the notifications, but only due to the fact
  that it uses only connected sockets, so that it is really zero cost
  and not so ugly.
