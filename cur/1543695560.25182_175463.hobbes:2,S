The Carrier Grade Linux specification has never dictated an
implementation.  In fact, both udev and uSDE are listed as potential
implementations.
As Lars stated in an earlier email, "Competition is good, but only if
they explore distinct approaches".  It is a shame that much effort has
been duplicated here on similar approaches.  I'm not fully aware of the
history behind the divergence, but it makes sense to enumerate NOW what
is lacking in udev from a uSDE perspective.  One objective of the
carrier grade initiative is to prevent duplicate effort.  Now that we
have two implementations, let's get the issues/differences on the table
and cooperatively move to convergence.
