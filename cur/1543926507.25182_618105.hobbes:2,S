I think that (c) is doable. If its worth the effort, who knows,
apparently there still are people using 32bit kernels on boxen with
mucho memory.

Agreed, the per mapping thing was utter crap.

But this problem is already an issue, Anton recently had a case where a
12GB highmem box locked up due to NTFS running out of lowmem - or
something like that.
And I think that with the targeted slab reclaim (or slab defrag as its
apparently still called) we can properly fix this side of the problem. I
think Rik was looking into doing so.
