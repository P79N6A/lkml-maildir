If we did the get_probably_unaligned() thing, then on architectures
where we _do_ trap and fix up, we could actually spit out a warning
whenever we hit a trap and it _wasn't_ marked with
get_probably_unaligned().

Mostly, the machines which can't handle traps are the machines which
don't even have an MMU. Why add hardware when you don't really need it?
Fundamentally, it isn't a hardware design flaw. You could perhaps ask
interesting questions about whether Linux is _really_ the right software
to be using on them, but the fact remains that Linux _is_ the software
people are using on them.
