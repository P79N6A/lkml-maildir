One thing which always surprises me in this discussion
(it comes up about once a year, it seems) is that
nobody participating in this discussion ever starts
writing any code for it.
Is this a feature which is only wanted by people who
don't want to code, or is this just a signal that the
amount of trouble involved just isn't worth it?
