Yep - already discussed on the linux-kernel and linux-usb lists. You can
do it with a semaphore. Its currently in testing. The USB drivers need
to sleep in order to handle the fact that their change is an
asynchronous message.
We do actually have to lock it or some drivers crash when you do the
fork 100 processes and all keep doing termios stuff attack.
Will send you a patch once its finished the test runs
