Ehhmm... The patch description says "remove pci_find_device()", which is 
used all over the map and isn't even deprecated (even though it probably 
should be, and people should just register their drivers correctly).
The actual patches themselves actually remove pcibios_find_device(), which
_is_ deprecated. But it's still used in a number of drivers. And no, Greg
did _not_ fix them up - do a simple grep if you don't believe me.
