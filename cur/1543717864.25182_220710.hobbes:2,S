    The above patch includes linux/mqueue.h from
arch/*/kernel/init_task.c for each arch.  Building the kernel fails on
ppc because ppc doesn't have an init_task.c; the setting of
CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE doesn't matter.  I added the include to
arch/ppc/kernel/process.c and the resulting kernel boots ok, but this
is probably not the correct place to put it.
    cris and m68k don't have an init_task.c either.
