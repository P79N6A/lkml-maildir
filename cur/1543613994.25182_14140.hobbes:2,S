Hi,
Compiling everything as modules yields some unresolved symbols (UP):
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in modules/kernel/drivers/net/wan/comx.o
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in modules/kernel/fs/binfmt_elf.o
(binfmt_elf compiled as module since Christian Koenig's multiboot patches
theoretically allow this.. but I can't really test :-( )
More info (.config, ...?) available upon request.
