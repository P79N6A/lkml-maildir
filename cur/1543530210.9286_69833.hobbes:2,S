      Yes, of course, but first of all I'd like to know what exactly
   the problems are.  I dislike creating yet another architecture
   specific function -- I'd prefer to keep the function generic, but
   allow the architecture to set the right constants (either by macros
   in pci.h [which can be defined to call functions if needed, of
   course] or by adding a new entry in struct pci_dev).
In my case for 2.4.x I'm going to need to play "BIOS" on sparc64 and
init all the latency timer (based upon min_gnt, max_latency, and 66MHZ
settings) and cache line size values because the boot firmware doesn't
do it.  I want to remove all of the ifdef __sparc__ garbage in PCI
drivers which exists now to accomplish this.
Also for some controllers I know cases where if you set the latency
timer such that PIO's from the host bridge are blocked out for more
than a certain amount of clocks, it can hang the host bridge.  I'd
like to be able to control this.
