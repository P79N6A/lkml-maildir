Actually you only have to be able to read SDA state, it might not be
true WRT SCL. I think most implementations use a single master and
a fixed access timing and thus only read SDA (SCL can as well be
a simple 2-state normal output from master instead of open
drain/collector or 3-state).
I'm not sure initializing the bus (in terms of ~ handshaking)
belongs to hw driver and not to the algorithm but such is live.
Thanks.
