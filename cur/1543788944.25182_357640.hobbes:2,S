bug description:
flock, lockf, fcntl do not return even after the signal SIGALRM  has 
been raised and the signal handler function has been executed
the functions should return with a return value EWOULDBLOCK as described 
in the man pages
test:
sequence of called functions (start the test in 2 terminal sessions)
1. signal
2. setitimer
3. fopen
4. fileno
5. fcntl with F_WRLCK and F_SETLKW (or flock or lockf)
6. getchar (to keep the lock in the 1st session; now start the 2nd)
in the 2nd session the file lock function (fcntl) will not return
kernel versions:
2.4.18-64GB-SMP
2.4.21psetlvm
