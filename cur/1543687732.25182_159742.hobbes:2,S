It probably was a combination of the other measures mentioned in my mail then. 
I have (had) the same problems, and one has to completely avoid the local 
APIC it seems. Passing noapic and disabling APIC Mode in the BIOS did not do 
that (2.6.0-test3 + acpi20030730).

see above. noapic had no effect on the freezes. On boot it still said "found 
and enabling local APIC" and the system freezes within minutes when I push 
data across the network. Just after compiling a kernel with absolutely no 
APIC stuff compiled in, it worked... Note that the nmi_watchdog was not 
triggered by the freezes, and that seems to run via the APIC, too.

ACPI works fine, when using at least acpi20030730. Without ACPI the interrupts 
are not assigned OK, as e.g. the onboard 3com NIC does not work (at least 
here).
