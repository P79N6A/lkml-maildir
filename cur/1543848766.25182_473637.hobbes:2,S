Subject: [PATCH 0 of 2] fsstack: generic stackable filesystem helper functions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patches introduce fsstack_copy_* functions. These functions
copy inode attributes (such as {a,c,m}time, mode, etc.) from one inode to
another.
While, intended for stackable filesystems any portion of the kernel wishing
to copy inode attributes can use them.
This series consists of two patches, the first introduces the fsstack
functions, and the second makes eCryptfs a user.
Changes since previous submission:
- rename to fsstack (akpm)
- removed fstack_copy_attr_timesizes (akpm)
- move non-inlined functions to fs/stack.c (Jan Engelhardt)
