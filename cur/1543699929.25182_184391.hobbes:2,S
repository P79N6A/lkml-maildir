I think setting HZ much lower than 100 might break some drivers that
do things like:
		timeout = jiffies + (HZ / 50);
Not sure if any of the common drivers have this problem but be on the
lookout for it if you want to try running w/ really low HZ.
I suppose there should really be a "FRACTION_OF_SECOND()" macro or something
that always returns >0 for specifying these really short delays.
