Hello all,
I have tried 2.4.21-rc2 with aic79xx-linux-2.4-20030502-tar.gz for three days
now and have to say it performs well. I had no freezes any more and nothing
weird happening. Everything is smooth and ok. This is the best performance I
have seen comparing all 2.4.21-X versions tested.
Thanks a lot.
I will proceed with further stress tests...
Regards,
Stephan
