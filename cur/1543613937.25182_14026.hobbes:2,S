I disagree - we can probably make the aio by Ben quite important. Done
right, it becomes a very natural way of doing event handling, and it could
very well be rather useful for many things that use select loops right
now.
So I actually like the thing as it stands now. What I don't like is how
it's been handled, with people inside Oracle etc working with it, but
_not_ people on the kernel mailing list. I don't worry about the code
nearly as much as I worry about people starting to clique together.
