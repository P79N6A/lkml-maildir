No. Don't be misled by the "password". Translated into driver language
the question just is: I have a vendor-unique command that must transport
data to the disk. How? And if it doesnt work today the possibility must
be added.
(Long ago I had various small programs that did vendor-unique things
to ata floppies, zip drives, large ide drives and the like.
Commands for doorlocking, for switching between removable disk / big floppy
mode, for reading and setting the native max address, etc.
Unfortunately some random patch that accompanied one of these programs
got into the official tree, so that we now have the HDIO_DRIVE_CMD ioctl.
It does do_cmd_ioctl(). But that was special purpose for setmax,
not general purpose, and it does not transport data to the disk.
We need a slightly more general interface. Maybe we do have it already,
I have not watched this closely.)
