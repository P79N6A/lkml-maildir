Clearly your fix is subtle enough that a quick reading, at least by me,
can't follow all the nuances, but it looks on first reading as if your
patch fixes this too well, and will now starve the threaded process by
only giving one turn at the CPU per full pass through the queue, rather
than sharing the timeslice between threads of a process.
I posted some thoughts on this to Robert, if you would comment I would
appreciate. My thought is that if you have N processes and one is
threaded, the aggregate of all threads should be 1/N of the CPU(s), not
vastly more or less. I think with your change it will be less if they are
sharing a resource. Feel free to tell me I misread what it does, or my
desired behaviour is not correct.
I do run 15 machines with long running a threaded server application and
periodic CPU hog things like log roll and compress, stats generation,
certain database cleanup, etc, and I have more than intelectual curiousity
on this behaviour.
