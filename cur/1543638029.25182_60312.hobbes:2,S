 Hi,
I'm by no means an expert in this, just a guess:

When you quit from fdisk it does a sync() right after the close().  I
suspect that fdisk gets stuck in that sync() rather than close().  (You
said strace reported close() as the last syscall - it's the last one
completed.)  The write on one of the channels doesn't let sync() return.
To make sure I'd try to check (e.g. with /proc/<pid>/fd) if fdisk still
has /dev/hdc open during the dd.
  Cheers,
  	Roman.
