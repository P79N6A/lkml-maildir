page_mkclean() has all the needed logic for this, it also walks the rmap
and cleans out all other users, which I think is needed too for
consistencies sake:
Process A			Process B
mmap(foo.txt)			mmap(foo.txt)
dirty page
				dirty page
msync(MS_ASYNC)
				dirty page
msync(MS_ASYNC) <--- now what?!
So what I would suggest is using the page table walkers from mm, and
walks the page range, obtain the page using vm_normal_page() and call
page_mkclean(). (Oh, and ensure you don't nest the pte lock :-)
All in all, that sounds rather expensive..
