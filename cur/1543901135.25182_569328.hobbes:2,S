If we share the CPU with the other thread, it means that it won't be on
the runqueue while we are holding the rq lock. This first case will then
end up in the else branch.
The other case, !task_migrate_count(req->task), is meant to check if the
process has been scheduled between the unlock/lock of the rq. In this
case, it has already decremented its migrate_count to 0.

True.

Yep, this is why it's an RFC. We will have to work on this a little
more.
