1:     True:  we need some interface (and small code)
2:     FALSE: you CAN listen icmp6 message via raw socket.
3:     FALSE: you CAN create tunnel using raw socket;
              however, we think this is implemented in kernel.
4,5,6: True:  we need some interface to generate proxy ND.
              (proxy ND is already in kernel.)
For 1,4,5,6: "proxy address" on a device would be a solution.
