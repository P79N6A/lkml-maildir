You can run "info thread" to see how many cpus are are there. Use "thread" to 
switch to a different thread and then run "bt" to see the stack of that
that thread. We have observed some issues with this. You will see proper
stack only if other cpus were not running swapper thread (pid 0).  
For seeing the stack of all the processes, I guess macros need to be written
which traverse the task list, retrieve stack pointer and then trace back. I
have not tried it though.

Yes, we are looking into this.
