Define it with ULL   (= long long)

AFAIK the problem is that it has no default promotion for constants to 
long long (normally they are int, long, unsigned long etc. depending on
their value) It's some C99 thing. Or maybe a gcc bug. Anyways ULL 
makes it clear that it is unsigned long long.

P.S.: The warning is thankfully turned off by default again in later
compilers.
