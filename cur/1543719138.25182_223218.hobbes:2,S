Subject: [PATCH]Diskdump - yet another crash dump function
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Although I know about LKCD and netdump, I'm developing yet another crash
dump, which is a polling-based disk dump as netdump do. Because it
disables any interrupts during doing dump, it can avoid lots of problems
LKCD has.
Main Feature
- Reliability
   Diskdump disables interrupts, stops other cpus and writes to the 
   disk with polling mode. Therefore, unnecessary functions(like
   interrupt handler) don't disturb dumping.
- Safety
   Before writing to the disk, diskdump checks its disk partition to 
   confirm whether it is a really dump device. Therefore, diskdump
   doesn't overwrite filesystems by mistake.
Currently, diskdump supports only scsi disk(aic7xxx/aic79xx), but, I'm
planning to support IDE disk in the near future.
Diskdump can be downloaded from here.

Please see readme.txt which can be downloaded from this site.
Any comments?
Best Regards,
