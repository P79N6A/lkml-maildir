Yep. Wonderful. When the socket disconnects, select doesn't return!
It only returns if the exception mask is enabled. So maybe I should
use an exception mask to get select() to return but ignore it. The
read/write code does as you show, but without the exception mask
select() doesn't return after a disconnect. At least not on
the 'current' versions of Linux (up to 2.3.41).
Cheers,
