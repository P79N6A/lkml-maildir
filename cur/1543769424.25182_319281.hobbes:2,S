Subject: [PATCH] prevent NULL mmap in topdown model
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/18/252

This (trivial) patch prevents the topdown allocator from allocating
mmap areas all the way down to address zero.  It's not the prettiest
patch, so suggestions for improvement are welcome ;)
