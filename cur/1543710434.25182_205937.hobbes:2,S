Another way to put it is that treatment of file system pages is dumbed
down to the level of mapped ones: information about access patterns is
just discarded.

I think that decisions about balancing VM and file system caches should
be done by higher level, rather than by forcing file system to use
low-level mechanisms designed for VM, where only limited information is
provided by hardware. Splitting page queues is a step in a right
direction, as it allows to implement more precise replacement for the
file system cache.
