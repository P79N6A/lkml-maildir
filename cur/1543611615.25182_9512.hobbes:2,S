Hi Justin,

The problem is that there is absoloutly no defined QA-cycle for these
kernels. Please take a look at what distributors (at least most, I know
at least one counter-example):
 o they freeze at one public kernel release
 o they do testing, lots of testing
 o they apply bugfixes for problems found in their debugging
   or coming in new releases _only_.  No new major changes that
   might break things.
That's why new distribution releases tend to come with 'old-looking'
kernels.
With kernel.org release _any_ new release mixes features, rewrites and
bugfixes.  I hope this will change a little for 2.4 now that Marcelo
who does the above cycle for for Conectiva takes over maintainership.
But in can't in whole - noone would really freeze the stable series
as strict as distributors do.
	Christoph
