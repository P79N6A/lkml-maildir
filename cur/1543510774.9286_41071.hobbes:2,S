Hi,
We're running linux 2.2.12 and have some trouble using gdb with kcore on the
running kernel.
We built kernel with -g option but gdb see only some symbols. In the
example above we tried to see 2 symbols from printk.c but type return are
strange...
2.0.32 kernel, and have no problem with kcore, so did we made a mistach or kcore
is not usable in 2.2.12 ?? Or is gdb not usable with kcore ?
Thank you very much for your help.
Regards,
Antoine Drouin
