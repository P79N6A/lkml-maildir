I understand that, in general, but how does that optimization help,
here, exactly?  My argument is that if we use the slab, it means more
code sharing with existing code in sparse.c.  Other than ideology, what
practical reasons are there in this case that keep us from doing that
otherwise attractive code sharing.

I don't think the pagetable walks are generic enough to ever get used on
ppc, unless they start walking the Linux pagetables for the kernel
virtual address area.  I was trying to poke you into getting the
pagetable walks out of sparse.c. ;)

I think it is best to just completely replace
sparse_early_mem_map_alloc() for the vmemmap case.  It really is a
completely different beast.  You'd never, for instance, have
alloc_remap() come into play.
