Well that would be nice.  Bear in mind that one usage scenario is to say
"hey, machine 342 has stopped responding" and to then fire up gdb and
connect to that machine with kgdboe.
In other words: if we rely on a gdb instance being connected at the time of
the exception, that message will be lost.  There needs to be a way of
retrieving the message post-facto.
