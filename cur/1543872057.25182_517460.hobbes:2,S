Ok. I understand now one of the sources of misunderstanding. I don't
want to mix console and application serial port. It was a question,
Myke Frisinger initially asked. I would switch on/off console
depending on some external control action if possible...
The other problem is how to open serial port with correct settings
_after_ booting. In this case /proc could be applicable, isn't it?
