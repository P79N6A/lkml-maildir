Well, how it handles it is manifestly unclear. It seems to trace down to
the dentry and call dentry_open(), but with a struct vfsmount as
another arg. I don't know what that's for. It got the vfsmount by aother
esoteric lookup, getting a struct nameidata from the filename via
open_namei.
Yecch. I have the inode of the sepecial device file. I don't want to
know the name. I even have a file pointer.
In dentry_open(), we get a struct file f = get_empty_filp(), and then
fill out various of its fields with enormously obscure things.  And for
the O_DIRECT flag we seem to do alloc_kiovec(1, &f->f_iobuf).
I feel that the latter is all I want to do, and the question is to what,
where (I'll clean up on release). Do I do this every time the devices
_open() function is called? Or just once, and what do I do it to? I
should do it to the struct file that gets passed into to the driver
open()? I'll try that. And set the flag.
