Bob Matthews has a benchmark called irman, which tries to measure
response time during a number of background loads.
I'm not sure it is too interesting in this case, though. People
don't really care about the exact latency of sub-millisecond
responses (should be the vast majority) but about the few times
per minute where their mp3 skips.
Simple averages won't show the mp3 skips, because the number of
fast responses are bound to be hundreds of thousands of times
more common then the "mp3 skipping hickups".
Maybe the histogram mode of irman might show something useful ?
(then again, maybe it doesn't ... haven't tried yet)
