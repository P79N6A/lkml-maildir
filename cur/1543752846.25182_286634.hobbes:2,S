Hello,
I have a Gigabyte GA-5AA Board with ALi Aladdin IV Chipset ( 1533, 1541 ). I
tried to get the smbus to work, but Gigabyte have disabled it and I can't
activate it in the BIOS. I use kernel 2.6.10 and looked at the m7101-hotplug
for kernel 2.4-module from lm_sensors. I added the following to
drivers/pci/quirks.c:
....
/* ALi 1533 fixup to enable the M7101 SMBus Controller
* ported from prog/hotplug of the lm_sensors
* package
*/
static void __devinit quirk_ali1533_smbus(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
u8 val = 0;
pci_read_config_byte ( dev, 0x5F, &val );
if ( val & 0x4 )
{
pci_write_config_byte ( dev, 0x5F, val & 0xFB );
}
}
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER(PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_AL_M1533,
quirk_ali1533_smbus );
....
Now the scanpci command shows the M7101 BUT lspci and /proc/pci,
/proc/bus/pci, /sys/bus/pci NOT. What can I do? Is there anything like a
"update_pci" command?
Thanx,
EnricoB
