I don't think either is really a solution. IMHO there should be a
distinction between "official tags" (that get passed around together with
everything else) and "private tags" for everybodys own home use (that could
be passed around, but only explicitly). Plus the possibility to erase,
move, &c private tags, and perhaps upgrade them to official status (thus
setting them in stone).
