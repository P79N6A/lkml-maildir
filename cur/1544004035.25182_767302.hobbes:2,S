Sorry about that.  Here's a revision:
Implement correct range checking for adt7470 to prevent userland from
writing impossible values into the chip, and cap out-of-range values per
standard hwmon conventions.
Implement correct rounding of input values per standard hwmon
conventions.
Is that better?
(Same goes for the adt7473 patch.)
