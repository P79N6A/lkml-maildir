That assumption is probably made because that's what POSIX and Single
Unix Specification define: "The st_ino and st_dev fields taken together
uniquely identify the file within the system."  Don't blame code that
follows standards for breaking.

That is not a good check.  I could have two separate files that have
multiple links; if st_ino is the same, how can tar make sense of it?
