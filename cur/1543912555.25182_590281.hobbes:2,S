100% agreed.

It does not have "nothing" to do with the regression.
Some setups which worked more by accident than by design earlier on were broken
by the fix. This could have been avoided, I agree, but the breakage was caused
by the fix (or the breakage is the fix, however you prefer to look at it).

*part* of it wasn't a security hole.
The other half very much was.

Sure, given that Trond (or whomever) has the time it takes to go and implement
all of this, there's no need to screw anyone.
Assuming he's on a schedule and this will have to wait, I agree with him that
it makes the most sense to play it safe security/consistency-wise rather than
functionality-wise.

It makes troubleshooting possible, which adresses *the* major complaint from
*one* of the *two* people who complained about this.
