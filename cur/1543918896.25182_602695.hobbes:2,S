here's some (good) text footprint data:
with the feature disabled (which is the default), the text size 
difference with patch #1:
  vmlinux:
     text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  7732358 1157269  401408 9291035  8dc51b vmlinux.before
  7732358 1157269  401408 9291035  8dc51b vmlinux.after
i.e. no overhead. Text size difference with patch #2:
  vmlinux:
     text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  7732358 1157269  401408 9291035  8dc51b vmlinux.before
  7732374 1157269  401408 9291051  8dc52b vmlinux.after
16 bytes, or 0.0002% of the total text size. So there's in essence no 
text overhead to talk about. So the text overhead argument is a red 
herring.
