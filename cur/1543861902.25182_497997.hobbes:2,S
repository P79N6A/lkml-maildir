I gave it a try, and I'm afraid the results weren't pretty.
I did:
time find /usr/src | wc -l
on current git with (3 times) and without (5 times) the patch, and got
with:
real   54.306, 54.327, 53.742s
usr    0.324, 0.284, 0.234s
sys    2.432, 2.484, 2.592s
without:
real   24.413, 24.616, 24.080s
usr    0.208, 0.316, 0.312s
sys:   2.496, 2.440, 2.540s
Subsequent runs without dropping caches did give a significant
improvement in both cases (1.821/.188/1.632 is one result I wrote with
the patch applied).

Nigel
