	Stop here. If somebody can alter init what prevents him from
plain and simple exec on /bin/sh? Not from the kernel, right from init.
If /sbin/init is compromised, *all* stakes are off. init has to be
called first _and_ with complete privileges. If you can alter its code
you can do anything that can be in principle done from user mode.
Considering insmod... Well, anything that can be done from kernel mode
is also available, just roll a code and submit it to kernel.
