And just to follow up on my own mail, this patch works great. This has to be one of
the cleanest module conversions I've seen in a while. Although it _will_ require a minor
change to all of the scsi drivers, the scsi_module.c implementation helps a lot.
At first I was sceptical about the scsi subsytem structure, but it turns out this _is_
what made it possible to do it cleanly, so kudos to Eric.
