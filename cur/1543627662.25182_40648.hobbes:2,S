      This patch has been floating inside IBM for a bit, but it appears 
   that no one passed it back up to you, yet.  I don't know who wrote it, 
   but it applies to 2.5.8 and the ServeRAID driver works just fine with it 
   applied.  Without it, the driver fails to compile.
Alan commented today on this list why these changes are not
acceptable.
