Are there any Linux file systems that work by mmapping the entire
drive and using the paging system to do the read/writes? With 64 bits
there's enough address space to do that now. How does this perform
compared to a traditional block based scheme?
With the IBM 128b address space aren't the devices vulnerable to an
errant program spraying garbage into the address space? Is it better
to map each device into it's own address space?
