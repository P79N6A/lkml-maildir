I do not have a clue about memory management at all, but is it
possible that you're testing on a box with too much memory? My box has
only 256 MB, and I used to use mutt with a _huge_ inbox with mutt
taking somewhat 150 MB. Add spamassassin and a reasonably busy mail
server, and the box used to be like 150 MB in swap.
I have tidied my inbox in the mean time and mutt's memory requirement
has been reduced to somewhat 30 MB, which might be the cause that I
don't see the issue that often any more.
Greetings
Marc, just trying to give input
