Yes, sorry, it was Eric's suggestion.

But in your example, the "propagated mount inherits ownership from
parent mount" would also work, since in all namespaces the owner of
the parent would necessary be "me".
The "inherits parent" semantics would work better for example in the
"all nosuid" namespace, where the user is free to modify it's mount
namespace. 
If for example propagation is set up from the initial namespace to
this user's namespace and a new mount is added to the initial
namespace, it would be nice if the propagated new mount would also be
owned by the user (and be "nosuid" of course).
Does the above make sense?  I'm not sure I've explained clearly
enough.
