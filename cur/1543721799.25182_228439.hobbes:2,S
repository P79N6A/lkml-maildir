A cache that might need reaping is a cache that has seen at least one 
kmem_cache_free(). The list would trade less time in the timer context 
at the expense of slower kmem_cache_free calls. I'm fairly certain that 
this would be end up as a big net loss.

I'll write something:
- allow to disable the DMA kmalloc caches for archs that do not need them.
- increase the timer frequency and scan only a few caches in each timer.
- perhaps a quicker test for cache_reap to notice that nothing needs to 
be done. Right now four tests are done (!flags & _NO_REAP, 
ac->touched==0, ac->avail != 0, global timer not yet expired). It's 
possible to skip some tests. e.g. move the _NO_REAP caches on a separate 
list, replace the time_after(.next_reap,jiffies) with a separate timer.
