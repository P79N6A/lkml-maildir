Hi,
I am trying to build the kernel with LLVM 2.5 prerelease (using
llvm-gcc-4.2 frontend), however I am running into some inline asm
semantics issues, and after some discussion on LLVM bugzilla I would
like to know if you would be accepting patches for this:
http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3373
The problem is when "a" output constraint is used with a variable of
smaller width than the
"0" input constraint.
Here are 2 examples:
int __ret_pu; unsigned long __pu_val;
return   ({asm volatile("call __put_user_" "8" : "=a" (__ret_pu) :"0"
                          (__pu_val), "c"(addr) : "ebx"); __ret_pu;});
unsigned char return_code;      /* %al */         
unsigned long address;          /* %ebx */ 
unsigned long length;           /* %ecx */
unsigned long entry;            /* %edx */
unsigned long flags;
__asm__("lcall *(%%edi); cld"
                : "=a" (return_code),
                  "=b" (address),
                  "=c" (length),
                  "=d" (entry)
                : "0" (service),
                  "1" (0),
                  "D" (&bios32_indirect));
There are 2 cases:
1. output is wider than input
2. output is narrower than input
Case 2 seems to occur lots of times on 64-bit (due to sizeof(int) != sizeof(unsigned long)), 
and a few times on 32-bit as well.
Would you accept patches that increase the portability of the inline asm statements? 
(essentially by adding casts for case 1, and introducing a temporary of correct width for case 2).
Please see:
