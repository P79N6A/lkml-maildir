does this include informations about the drives SMART status, too?
The smartmotools (
http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/
) won't work
with libata until some "passthrough" command gets implemented :-(
Will this be available soon (or even working now), or do I have to
wait until 2.7?
This is the main reason, that prevents me from switching to SATA now!
Just when writing these lines, I'm analyzing some prefail indications
from one of my 300G PATA disks via SMART. I have no problem, to replace
that disk now, but when running those disks blindly without SMART over
SATA, I certainly would loose those 300G very soon...
So, can you give us an idea of a time line about those things, please?
Dieter.
