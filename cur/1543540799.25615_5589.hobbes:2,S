The only expensive one which of which I'm aware is the lock in
zap_page_range(): "This is a long-lived spinlock.".
My approach here was to bust zap_page_range() up into 512-page chunks with
one reschedule per chunk.  Ingo's patch does this on a per-page basis: tests
need_resched and then, if required, drops the lock and reschedules.
