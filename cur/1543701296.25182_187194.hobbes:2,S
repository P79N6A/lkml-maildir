So you are telling me that I am paying the price for running development 
kernels and enabling all the debugging.  I enjoy running the development 
stuff and testing new stuff.  I enabled all the kernel hacking and 
debugging options with the idea it might be useful for testing purposes.  
Disabling all the debugging stuff brings the numbers down, but things 
still "feel" worse.  It's subjective, but there you are.  I'll continue to 
test with whatever provides the most useful data.
