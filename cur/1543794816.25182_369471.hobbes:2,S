This patch:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113138286512847
was intended to fix exactly this problem (and the same test program was
used to exploit the race and test the fix).
So, it does not help? I can't reproduce the problem.
Note: I think you also need this patch:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113059955626598
otherwise I beleive OOPS can happen while killing this program if you are
running the kernel with this change applied:
	[PATCH] Call exit_itimers from do_exit, not __exit_signal

I think this code at line ~718
	leader->group_leader = leader;
is noop, because leader->group_leader == leader here.

This can't help, without SIGEV_THREAD_ID we don't check ->group_leader,
the signal goes to the thread group via timer->it_process, which is equal
to the old leader.
