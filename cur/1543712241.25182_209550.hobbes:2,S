Recent 2.6.5-pre* and -rc1 and -BK don't boot on my Motorola Powerstack
(PReP with no RTAS but with OF).
I use netboot to test new kernels.  Normally, the screen is changed to
VGA text mode and the bootloader speaks some lines of info and asks for
the kernel command line. Now, the image is loaded via tftp (as shown by
tcpdump, the last datagram is smaller) and nothing more happens. The
cursor stays where it is - at the beginning of the Booting ... line in
graphics mode OF environment and that's all.
