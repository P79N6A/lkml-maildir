Well, I understand what you mean, but if the linux kernel wants it
and the C spec doesn't forbid it, then it'll either stay that way
or an "official" way will be found of evoking the desired behaviour.
The kernel already relies on -O1 expanding outb().

Actually, I was a bit more worried that 
  const unsigned int i = 1;
  if (i < 0)
      foo();
would generate warnings about the comparison always failing. But it
doesn't, at least not with -Wall. It does generate a warning about
implicitly declaring the function foo()! So I guess one has to add a
decl for it just above the call.  But it doesn't emit code for the call
itself, so the link is fine.
OTOH I now can't get #__LINE__ to expand as I want it where I want it.
