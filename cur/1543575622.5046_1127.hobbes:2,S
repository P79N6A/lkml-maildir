Alan,
thanks for your input but I think it won't work this way because the value
of smp_num_cpus needs to be increased by one right before a new cpu gets
started. Then one can imagine the following situation at one of the cpus
that needs to be captured:
read the value of smp_num_cpus;
- interrupt that is intended to capture this cpu -
the value of smp_num_cpus will be increased and the new cpu will be started
by another cpu before this cpu continues with normal operation;
- end of interrupt handling -
do something that relies on the prior read value of smp_num_cpus (which is
now wrong);
The result would be an inconsistency. This problem should not occur if all
cpus would be captured by kernel threads.
I still wonder what you and other people think about the idea of an
interface where the parts of the kernel with per-cpu dependencies should
register two functions...
Best regards,
Heiko
By the way, I changed the subject of your original reply because I sent my
first mail twice (with and without a subject line).
I'm sorry for my own stupidity :)
