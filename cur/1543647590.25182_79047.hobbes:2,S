There is something I do not understand:
struct tst {
	struct x_t	*x;
}
does not need any predeclaraion, tested with gcc -Wall, 2.96, 3.0.4, 3.2.
struct tst {
	x_t	*x;
}
needs it, but you can predeclare a
typedef struct x_t x_t;
if do not want the full include. So I really do not know why everybody
agreed on removing it.
