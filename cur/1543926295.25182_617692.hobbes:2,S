And congratulations to him for that.  We almost entirely dropped 2.6.16,
but there's a regression some time since then that makes large MMAPed
files a major pain (specifically the dcc database clean takes about 5
minutes on 2.6.16 and about 12 hours on 2.6.20 or 2.6.23 series kernels)
But we keep putting off writing a small testcase that can repeat the
issue so we can bisect it - because it's working fine with 2.6.16 on
that machine.
