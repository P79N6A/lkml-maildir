I just though about another possible crap, though I haven't looked
enough to be sure, but PCI interfaces with no device will trigger
a similar problem as "empty" ide-pmac interfaces in that sense that
they will change dma ops, possibly mmio ops, etc.... If they hold
no device, their hwif->present will not be set, and thus the hwif
slot can possibly get re-used by thing like ide-cs (or anybody else
that rely on ide_register_hw() to allocate a new slot) without
those changes to hwif done by the PCI interface beeing cleared.
So my patch may actually fix some cases there too.
Ben.
