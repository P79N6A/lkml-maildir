I assume that you mean by "not worth using x86" you're referring to say,
degraded performance over other platforms? Well...if you talk
price/performance, using x86 is perfect in those terms since you can buy
more boxes and have a more fluid architecture, rather than building a
monolithic system. Monolithic systems aren't always the best. Just look
at Fermilab!
