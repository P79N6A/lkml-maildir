It's mainly used for programs that needs lots of processing power
chucked at a specific problem, the problem is first broken down into
several small pieces and each part is sent off to a different
processor.  When each piece has been processed, they are all
recombined and the rest of the calculation is continued.  The problem
with this is that if any one of the pieces is delayed, all the
processors will be idle waiting for the interrupted piece to be
processed, before they can process the next set of pieces.
