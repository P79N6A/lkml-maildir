I'm not moving the kernel/timer.c clocksource user back into
kernel/time/clocksource.c . That code completely belongs with the
generic time of day changes. The code is directly coupled, and in fact
it improves the timekeeping clock switching code to have it that way.
I'd be happy to create kernel/time/timeofday.c though .
