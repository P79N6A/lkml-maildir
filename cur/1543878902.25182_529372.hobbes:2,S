Subject: [PATCH 21/30] Use menuconfig objects - PHY
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/10/301

(No MAINTAINERS entry. MODULE_AUTHOR lines exist, but without addresses.)
Use menuconfigs instead of menus, so the whole menu can be disabled at        
once instead of going through all options.
