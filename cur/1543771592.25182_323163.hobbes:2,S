The dock is already connected at power-up time.

I have already experimented with compiled-in versions of these drivers
(as well as the ACPI PCI hotplug driver).

I have /sys/bus/pci/slots/, but it is empty. Should I make another
attempt with driver modules instead of the compiled in versions?

Actually, the dock itself has a PCI ExpressCard slot (currently
empty) as one of its peripherals. But my current difficulties are
with the PCI-Express connection between notebook and dock.
