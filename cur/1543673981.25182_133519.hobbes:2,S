No, this sort of thing should be in the .config file, but NOT accessible
via the point-and-drool interface.  Make them vi it and do it the hard way...
The difference being that if you turn on kernel debugging, there's less chance
of random program XYZ you download from someplace throwing an ENOSYS because
some syscall is missing/broken, with the ensuing hilarity of debugging (since
the actual problem might be in some library rather than in the code you
downloaded).
Of course, I may just be jaded - I've gotten too many reports from bozos with
firewalls that read "ntp-1.vt.edu is portscanning from port 123, please stop it
right now or I'm calling the FBI".  But although most people that build their
own kernels can reason through "maybe my FooBar2003 would work better if I
included the driver for it",  but figuring that Frobozz isn't working because
libgronk is broken because somebody removed futexes because they thought they
sounded futile.....
