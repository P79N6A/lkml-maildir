Lorenzo did an update to qsbench.  qsbench is much faster 
than hint for a ram shortage simulation.
Current lineup:
qsbench with 2 process = 120% TotalMem
1) qsbench alone
2) qsbench with ed compile loop
3) qsbench + very small chat bench loop (5 clients, 1 room)
4) qsbench + postmark loop with ~ 40000 small files
Hm, guess i should also time 2, 3, and 4 without qsbench 
for comparison.  2, 3, 4 run in less than 10 seconds 
on quad xeon.  The idea is to count the loops that complete 
during the time for qsbench to do it's thing.
The first run on 2.5.38 got overwritten during a mkfs. :(
Any suggestions before i lose the next batch of data ;)
