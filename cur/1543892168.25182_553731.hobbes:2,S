It _might_, but not necessarily.
Won't a simple struct { uint16_t } get padded to a size of 4 bytes on
ARM? Even if I'm misremembering that, I certainly can't guarantee that
such a thing will _never_ happen on any newly-invented ABI. If you had
'nopadding' instead of 'packed', then there's no need to emit code to
handle unaligned loads.
Likewise, with a struct which looks like this: 
   { uint32_t, uint16_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint32_t }
I cannot _guarantee_ that there will never be an architecture on which
we'll end up using 32 bits of space for each uint16_t. I might _guess_
that and hope, but that's precisely the kind of moronic empirical
behaviour which caused Linux to have so many problems with newer
compilers in the past. If it isn't _guaranteed_ then I shouldn't be
assuming it.
Thus, I want a way to tell the compiler not to insert _any_ padding. But
without the compiler making extra inferences about the whole thing being
found at arbitrary alignments.
And if I had something like this (which is admittedly contrived, but
hardware people _do_ do stupid things to us):
   { uint32_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint8_t, uint32_t, uint32_t }
With the 'packed' attribute the compiler would assume arbitrary
alignment of all the 32-bit integers. But in reality it's only necessary
for the uint16_t in the middle. A 'nopadding' attribute would deal with
that correctly.
