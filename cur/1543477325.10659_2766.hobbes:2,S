1. During backup from nfs mounted drives, network connection is lost
2.
We have a rather complicated local network. Complicated in the sense
that there are many different machine and OS's
connected. Unfortunately, I don't have the full grasp of what is going 
on with our network, so the following may not be very helpful.
From my linux-2.2.0-pre5 machine, I try to backup all our unix home
directories, using a local connected scsi HP SuperStoreTape DAT
drive. I do this by mounting the directories I need, read-only, to
agnesi (my machine), and run tar through a very simple script. tar
then backups the chosen directories (some nfs mounted, some local)
onto tape.
Using linux-2.0.36 there has never been a problem.
I tried it several times (both with 2.2.0-pre6 and 2.2.0-pre5), and
the connection to the local network (and thus Internet) seems to just
die. The following relevant messages comes in /var/log/messages:

I have tried to restart the nfs system (rpc.nfsd, rpc.mountd), ypbind
and protmap, but nothing helps.
ypwhich reports: can't yp_bind: Reason: Domain not bound
For not knowing any better, I end up rebooting, and everything is back 
to normal. If I don't do backup, everything runs fine for days.
The error messages occured when backing up from a nfs mounted
directory, whose host is a linux-2.1.105 SMP (dual pentium) system,
and when backing up from a NetBSD sysem. Backing up from SunOS seemed
to be no problem, also from FreeBSD system. Of course the amount of
files varies greatly, so this may not mean much.
NOTE: The "Domain not bound" message has occured on our network
before. Agnesi has had problems before, which seemed to come randomly,
of similar nature. However, at that time, only one machine on the
local network seemd unreachable, the rest was no problem. We used a
2.0.36 kernel. This time, this problem is reproduced every time I
peform the above mentioned backup.
(My apologies for this confusing report, but I am rather at loss by
this whole problem, so I am afraid this is the best I can do.)
