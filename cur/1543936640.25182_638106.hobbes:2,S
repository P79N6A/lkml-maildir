Jiri, I mean rtc_open() is protected by spinlock+status from being
opened simultaneously by a few processes. *But* lets imagine the
following situation - this fd (file descriptor) is opened by one
multithreaded application so all threads have an access to this
fd. Then one thread reads rtc periodically thru unlocked_ioctl
and another thread set new time from time to time. So the question
I have - is it possible to get second thread stopped at attemption to
get rtc spinlock while another thread is setting the new time? Or
this situation never-ever could be? i'm not really familiar with
process management in Linux and as result could be wrong.
