That would be in the BIOS right (or could it be done from linux) ?
Like i mentioned, my system is an IBM, which means tailored for users, 
which means that it(this particular system) won't let me add IRQ's to
monitor, at least not from within the BIOS setup.
I can select to monitor "Hard Disks" "Serial Ports" that kind
of granularity... But at least, what you are telling me, suggests to me
that actually this is probably a problem in my BIOS rather than the kernel.
Would apm=off bypass this kind of thing?
