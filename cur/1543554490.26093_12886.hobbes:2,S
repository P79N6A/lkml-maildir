Doh, totally forgot about that.  Will this work:
	save_current = current;
	current = find_task_by_pid(1);
	waitpid(...);
	current = save_current;
In any case, we -really- need a wait_for_kernel_thread_to_die()
function.

Cool tip, thanks.

what does this do?

why do you store the event_thread_pid but never use it?
