Your procedure seems to be perfect. Your problem is not caused by your
miss, but by gamecon.c specification.
There are several varieties in DPP-style pararrel connector. Each 1P
are same, but 2P+ are differant. Your DPP is 1 or 2 perhaps. Gamecon.c
seems to support 3 (SNESkey psx). I am sorry, I can not help you.
1. DPP standard (1P-2P)

1-1. DPP standard + unmodified multitap (1P-4P)

2. DPP multitap (1P-5P, also called "mega-tap")
