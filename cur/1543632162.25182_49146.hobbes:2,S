Omigod, don't even think that.  Kbuild 2.5 is faster and better than the
current kbuild.  I, for one, am waiting - impatiently - for the thing to get
in the tree.  The current build system is slow and unreliable, and don't even
think of trying to build two different architectures in the same source tree
at the same time.
