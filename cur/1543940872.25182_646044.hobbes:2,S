AFAICS you are misunderstanding the words "criminal" and "civil matter".
AFAIK in german law the difference between the two is that "criminal"
offences are prosecuted by the government out of their own accord while
"civil matters" require someone else to sue.
Murder and robbery are criminal offences.
Assuming the above is correct then copyright violations definitely are
"civil matters" in germany regardless whether you could go into jail or not.
Best,
Michael
