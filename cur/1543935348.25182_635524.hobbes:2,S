thanks, i have picked up the x86 bits.
Will pick up later cleanup versions as well if there's some better macro 
approach to do this as an ENTRY thing, as we could consolidate both the 
start and the end into a single macro:
        .type __down_failed_trylock, @function
ENTRY(__down_failed_trylock)
        CFI_STARTPROC
        CFI_ENDPROC
        END(__down_failed_trylock)
        .size __down_failed_trylock, . - __down_failed_trylock
perhaps START_FUNCTION() and END_FUNCTION() macros?
