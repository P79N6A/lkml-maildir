...and in doing so, violate the local regulatory constraints.  :)
Although I believe 802.11d specifies that the 802.11d beacons should 
trump whatever the user specifies.  (of course, 802.11d doesn't say what 
to do when there are APs out there that disagree...)
While I feel it should be *posisble* to do so, the default should be to
query the hardware for its factory default, and go with that.  Allowing
the user to change the regulatory domain at will.. is a rather fuzzy
legal area, to say the least.
