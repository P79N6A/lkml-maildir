ok, agreed.

well, the current sys_tkill implementation does not recognize '-1' at all:
        /* This is only valid for single tasks */
        if (pid <= 0)
                return -EINVAL;
it's a simple path to send signals to a single thread and nothing more.
are you suggesting to extend sys_tgkill() functionality to also detect -1
for the PID, and do a process-signal send? I dont think that's necessary,
because it overlaps the already existing sys_kill() functionality - and
probably it would just end up being an internal call to
kill_something_info() anyway.
if the goal is completeness then < -1 negative pid values should probably
be recognized as 'process group' values as well?
then sys_tgkill would basically be a super-kill(), encompassing all the
kill() semantics we have currently, extended with the group-specific send
functionality.
