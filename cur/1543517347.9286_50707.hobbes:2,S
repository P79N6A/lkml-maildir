  i tried setting file-max to 32768 and inode-max to
65536.  i've also set NR_OPEN and NR_FILE to 32K (in
limits.h and fs.h) then recompiled the kernel.
  in my program, i was able to set the maximum number
of open files to 32K (though setrlimit()). but when i
call poll with nfds > 256, i still get error.
