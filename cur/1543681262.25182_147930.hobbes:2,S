Ooops, wrong patch. I have a labyrinth of bitkeeper-trees here, all looking
almost the same.
The real patch contains cleaned up HZ-ifdefs.
Regarding the gcc "workaround" I said:
"I don't really know how to make clear it's not a gcc problem. But if it was,
 why doesn't it crash on pc and 1.0 xboxen? And why does it crash on kernels
 compiled with 2.95, with or without optimization? I really wish I had the
 explaination to this problem."
Or as Christoph answered: "Oh well, stupid crappy hardware..."
