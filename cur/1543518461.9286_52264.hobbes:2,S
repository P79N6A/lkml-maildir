Yep the Feb 3 1999 one is the one everyone has.
I think Alan had a go at it and couldnt get it to work using the docs.
Basically there is some undocumented setup required for the ymf744b to

figure it out.
Basically this isnt going to work until Yamaha wakes up. Makes you wonder
what theyre hiding.
