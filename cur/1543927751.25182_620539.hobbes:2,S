Once upon a time some filesystems fucked up when incorrect values
(negative offsets in particular).  So the easy way out was taken and
FIBMAP was restricted, to the eternal annoyance of DVD players which
needed the sector number for CSS reasons.  Since then dvd players have
included an udf parser and life went on.
Well, psx movie players needed it too, but bah.
Essentially if you remove the restriction you have to audit all
filesystems to be sure that they're not going to be problematic.
  OG.
