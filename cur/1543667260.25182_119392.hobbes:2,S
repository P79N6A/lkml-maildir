OK, thanks.  So with 48 disks you've lost five megabytes to blkdev_requests
and deadline_drq objects.  With 4000 disks, you're toast.  That's enough
request structures to put 200 gigabytes of memory under I/O ;)
We need to make the request structures dymanically allocated for other
reasons (which I cannot immediately remember) but it didn't happen.  I guess
we have some motivation now.
