Just to throw new thoughts in the ring...
From a users prospective it doesn't make much sense for all these
options.  I'm using a hypothetical user, who is savvy enough to
build a kernel.  Barely.
Such a user can usually be relied on to answer such questions as:
Processor Type
Bus Type (PCI, ISA, EISA, AGP)
Memory Model (2gig, 4gig. etc)
SMP or UP
Everything else is 'advanced' to a user.
Given that info (plus maybe a little more), it should be possible to
build a kernel, with everything modular.
A simple userspace external tool could be used to link modules
together into the kernel for cases that need that.
This would be *much* better for most users, distrabution makers, and
it would seem to be easier for driver makers (Hmm...this driver
needs a PCI bus, no problem).
Being able to say "don't build" for some modules/drivers would seem
to be an advanced feature that would be run *after* you set up the
above.
Ciao!
