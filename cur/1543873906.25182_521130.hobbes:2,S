What X driver are you using Mike?  Are you on a builtin video chipset 
using mobo shared memory?  I'm running the nvidia 9755 driver here with a 
jaton nvidia 6200-256 card here, and YES I KNOW that taints the kernel, 
but x is using on average, 1.3% of the cpu.  Its sitting at a -1 nice and 
it continues to give usable results here in the face of a make -j8 
running in another shell.
With figures (over 50% cpu to X)  like that, its no wonder you're 
squawking about it.
An old phrase comes to mind "Physician, Heal thyself".  Your X is broken 
and you are trying to blame everything but X.  Fix your hardware and 
drivers.
