I think I see a knee-jerk reaction here. I commented on the magnitude and
pervasiveness of the change, not the way it was done. I could write an
essay about the way it was done, but that wasn't what I was talking about,
just the low impact of lsm vs. modules.
I also mentioned that lsm would be an understandable major new feature,
encouraging a variety of applications (as iptables did for firewall
generators and load balancers). The new module code only gives rise to
busywork porting drivers and utilities to the new way of doing that same
old same old. If there's some neat new useful capability with modules I
must have missed that post. 
Yes, the idea that lsm is too radical to go into Linux does frost my ass,
and I'm not pretending it doesn't. But don't change the topic to "let's
not pick on Rusty," because I wasn't, at least in that post ;-)
