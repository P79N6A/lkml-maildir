After some more puzzling, it becomes clear that much more ACPI code should rely on CONFIG_PM. (Sleep.c should not be compiled in at all without CONFIG_PM) As the ACPI guys seem awake, I assume this will be fixed soon. For now: don't forget to enable CONFIG_PM (Power Management in the root of ACPI / APM configuration)
