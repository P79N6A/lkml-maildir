I'm not aware of ever using atime (maybe some cron script that I'm not
aware of does, or somesuch, but none that I know of).
atime is strange since it seems to be the only detail in Unix semantics which
makes reads side-effecting and turns them into writes, so that doing FOO on
a disk mounted read-only is not the same as doing FOO on the same disk mounted
read-write.
Eliminating atime is of course out of the question since we want to keep
POSIX compatibility, but how expensive would it be to have the notion of
essential and non-essential updates ?  atime updates would be tagged
non-essential so that their write-back could be delayed indefinitely.
