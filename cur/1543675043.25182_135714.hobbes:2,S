Tough. If people don't use them, they don't get supported. It's that easy.
The thing is, these things won't change before 2.6 (or at least a 
pre-2.6). When 2.6.0 comes out, and somebody notices that they haven't 
bothered to try the 2.5.x series, _then_ maybe some of those odd-ball 
drivers get fixed.
Or not. Some of them may be literally due for retirement, with users just 
running an old kernel on old hardware.
Btw, this is nothing new. It has _always_ been the case that a lot of 
people didn't use the latest stable kernel until it was released, and then 
they complained because the drivers they used weren't up to spec.
