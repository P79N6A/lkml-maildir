Hi guys,
I just spotted an interesting problem.
a) I run NFSv3 mountd (i.e. I don't specify --no-nfs-version 3)
b) v3 support compiled in the kernel (both client and server)
c) pass "tcp" option to select TCP protocol instead of UDP.
mount -t nfs -o tcp localhost:/test /mnt
this hangs. Also, if I try to pass -o nfsvers=3 on a v2-only kernel it
hangs too (inside mount(2) system call) 
Also, I thought that in v3 it should select tcp protocol by default but it
selects udp.
More details later...
Regards,
Tigran
