Hello everyone,
I'm resurrecting this thread because it appears we'll need to support 
these motherboards for several months to come, yet Adrian Bunk has 
scheduled the removal of eepro100 in January 2007.
To recap, we have to support ~30 EBC-2000T motherboards.
http://www.adlinktech.com/PD/web/PD_detail.php?pid=213
These motherboards come with three on-board Intel 82559 NICs.
Last time I checked, i.e. two months ago, e100 did not correctly 
initialize all three NICs on these motherboards. Therefore, we've been 
using eepro100.
I will be testing the latest 2.6.20 kernel to see if the situation has 
changed, but I wanted to let you all know that there are still some 
eepro100 users out there, out of necessity.
Regards,
John
