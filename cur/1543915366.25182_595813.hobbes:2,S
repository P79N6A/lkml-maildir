Ok.  I do agree that is wrong, and really weird to.

Which is certainly a good way to go if your hole sizes allow and you
have enough MTRRs.

Please look a little more closely.  WC is a flavor of UC.  There is a
specific exception that allows page tables to promote UC to WC.
I don't seem to have the same version of this document so I can't
refer you to specific sections.  But I have looked it up several
times and every time I have looked I have found the exception that
allows PAT to promote UC to WC.

Sure.
My point was that when we try to solve the general problem rather then
a specific case there are some very practical limits on what can be
done.
Now it should be mentioned that you can go in with /proc/mtrr and fix
things manually on a specific machine.
