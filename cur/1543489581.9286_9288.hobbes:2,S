	Forgive me if I show my lack of knowledge on the subject, but I've been
trying to figure out how to get MTRR working with my Nvidia TNT AGP board in
2.2.3 but it keeps giving me errors such as:
mtrr: base(0xe6000000) is not aligned on a size(0xff0000) boundary
Of course, I agree, it apparently isn't aligned that way.  Does this mean that
one cannot use MTRR with the NVidia TNT boards?  Looking on a Windows box with
the same card it appears to break up the 16 megs of video RAM into
non-contiguous blocks.  I'm not even sure if the Windows drivers are making
use of the MTRRs. Anyhow, just thought I'd throw out the question and see if
anyone would be kind enough to clue me in.  Thanks,
			  -Scott
