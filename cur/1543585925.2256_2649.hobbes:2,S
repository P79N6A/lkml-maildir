As said before, we're interested in people willing to do regression
tests on the kernel. Unfortunately, not all that many testers have
stepped forward and not all that many artificial tests are being run.
Good thing we still have the beta-testers to catch these things,
while running the kernel in real-world scenarios... ;)
