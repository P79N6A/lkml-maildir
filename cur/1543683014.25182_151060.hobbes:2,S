Hello again,
I have a few things to add:
1) If uhci_hcd was never loaded before suspend, one has to press a key on the keyboard after `echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep` in order to get the machine suspended. Wakeup does not work in that case, reboot required.
2) It makes no difference whether the Logitech USB Mouse is connected or not.
