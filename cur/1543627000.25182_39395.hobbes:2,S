The file operations structure(s) are structures. They are not object-
oriented in any way, and they are certainly not virtual. The code that
manipulates them is quite physical and procedural, well defined, and
visible to the rest of the kernel.

Err.  From the outside-in, any well-defined software functionality
can look like an "object". In fact, any well-defined and well functioning
software is indistinguishable from magic, therefore can be represented
as an object in the true object-oriented sense.

C++ is designed for user-mode programming. It expects to interface
with a complete operating system with well-defined characteristics.
It is not designed to be part of an operating system kernel.

It is quite unlikely that a C++ compiler will make more efficient
code than a C compiler. In fact, the code generator will likely
be the same. The C++ compiler will end up generating some preamble
code as part of the function-calling mechanism, that is not necessary
in C. This means that it will generate a bit more code.
Making code "cleaner" is a matter of perspective.
	class A {
        public: void func(char *st) { cout << st << endl; }
        };
        using A::func;
        A a;
        a.func("Hello World!");
Is not all that clean. In fact, I'm not sure I have it right. It's
easier and clearer to write  puts("Hello World!");
