I think it's Greenhouse ELP-10T.  But I think it doesn't matter.  Under
2.6.0-test3, "cardctl ident" couldn't even read the card's ID.  If it's
really necessary I can boot 2.4.19 to run "cardctl ident".  I don't know the
chipset but I think it doesn't matter.  As for knowing that it's 16-bit and
not 32-bit, even though I know you're even more of a volunteer than I am,
it's hard to keep civil about this.  Yes I know that it's 16-bit.  But even
if it magically changed to 32-bit, then the yenta driver should take over,
right?  But neither PCMCIA driver recognized the thing under 2.6.0-test3.
Oh, you might notice that "cardctl status" figured out that the thing takes
5 volts.  This is why I posted the outputs of "cardctl ident" and "cardctl
status" and the relevant part of .config.

Yes.  Read the archives about Japanese keyboards.  A patch was even POSTED,
in the -test1 days.  How come the patch didn't get into -test3?

"seems to be a result of compiling the new modules packages manually at a
time when I could not persuade the rpm --rebuild command to target the
correct cpu."  Yes, "the new modules packages" meant the new modules
packages.  I did have to ask about this at the beginning of -test1 days.  (I
never had time to try testing a 2.5 kernel but the appearance of 2.6.0-test1
made it look like testing would become valuable.)

I didn't think I needed it, but I didn't think it would hurt.  After all I
was trying to get some PCMCIA cards to work, and someday might try getting a
Cardbus card to work, and PCMCIA wasn't working yet, so I tried it.

This I will take a look at.  Thank you.  Though it makes me curious why
2.4.19 didn't need this, I will try it.  And I think I will have no problem
remaining civil while discussing it.  Thank you.

Guess why I compiled it without ACPI support and with APM support.  Guess
why my kernel command line has acpi=off apm=on.  (Although the command line
options are redundant with the self-compiled kernel configuration, they are
necessary when booting a generic kernel.  Yes I know that the machine has
just enough ACPI hooks to cause problems when anyone other than Windows 98
tries to use ACPI.  It's not even recommended to force ACPI on when
installing Windows 98 on this machine.  Windows 2000 blue screens if ACPI is
forced on.  Linux doesn't panic when its default ACPI takes over, but it
does prevent APM from working.)

Fine, but I didn't think I had to worry about that, since it looked like
Linux already properly detected the fact.

Oh, that could be it, I just noticed that the second and third occurences
relate to the PCMCIA slots.  May I ask though, what PIRQ mask is it, that is
failing to be matched?  It seems to me that it might be more useful for
2.6.0 to do as good a job as 2.4.19 did in figuring out the IRQs, and I
would like to continue testing this.  (Probably I can only spend about one
day a week on it though.)
