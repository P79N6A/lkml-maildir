At least we only had old wi-fi extensions [btw, wi-fi == wireless networks].
I currently tried to run it with 2.4.18 and it works mostly, only when trying
to boot on the other P133 system [as described in my other mail], the system
only hangs.

Most of my computers even have 2 floppies [my old boss gave them out for
free and I thought copying directly would be fast...which is just false!
Copying directly with one FDC is about 20 times slower! Possibly a problem
with out floppy driver ?]
