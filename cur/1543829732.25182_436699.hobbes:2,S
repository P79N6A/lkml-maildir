It's not a counterexample, but it may be an interesting example of
the sort of loosely coupled multiprocessor that gets more common.
The different processors use different power management schemes.
(I think an ACPI "embedded processor" has related issues.)

So presumably it's both "self" powered (so far as the parent hub is
concerned!) and also has some kind of cpu and firmware.  I'll assume
this chipset is used with discrete products too, not only for wiring to
motherboards.  (Despite the board layout advantages of using serial
interfaces:  fewer high speed signal lines, etc.)

The normal way to do such things -- from the perspective of the firmware
inside a USB peripheral doing that routing etc -- recognizes that the
USB suspend state affects only the upstream link, and uses remote wakeup
signaling in the normal fashion.  (An SPI or I2C/SMBUS based coprocessor
probably needs an IRQ signal line.)
That is, from the perspective of the host CPU, it's suspended normally.
Just like any other USB device (like I sketched above).
But the peripheral's CPU can continue doing whatever it likes ... which
doesn't necessarily include stopping.  Bus powered USB peripherals would
probably try to suspend their CPUs though, since otherwise it may be hard
to meet the 500 microAmpere power budget.
