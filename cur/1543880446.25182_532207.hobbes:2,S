I think these are both issues that should be solved by smarts in the
initrd.
All of the (unused) kernel parameters are in the environment aren't
they? (if not, they can easily be put there).
So maybe insmod/modprobe could be updated to extract relevant options
from the environment.
And the mount of the root filesystem should be called as:
    mount ${rootfstype+-t $rootfstype} $dev $mountpoint
We are depending more and more on initrd and I think it hurts not
having a reference implementation.
Currently each distro makes their own and while I'm sure they are all
quite good in their own way, the fact that they are independent makes
community input harder.
What we really need is a single reference implementation of "mkinitrd"
which each distro can fiddle with to their heart's content.  Then
sensible ideas like the above can be incorporated into the reference,
and all distros will ultimately pick them up.
But unfortunately I don't have the time to volunteer for this role...
