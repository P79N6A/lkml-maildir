  followup to the posting of 2003/07/09. Patchkit is still divided in 8 parts:
1 - devices;
2 - utility and common code for vcs (vc/pvc/svc);
3 - pvc;
4 - svc;
5 - vc;
6 - arp;
7 - lec;
8 - final cleanup.
Gross bugs have been fixed in #7. It now passes some basic testing. Its
behavior with a huge number of lec remains to be proved. Others parts
already seemed quite nice last month.
