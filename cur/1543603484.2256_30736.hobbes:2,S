Subject: [PATCH][RFC] Pollable /proc/<pid>/ - avoid SIGCHLD/poll() races
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/10/4/53

I've recently run across a problem where a server (in this case, sshd) 
can deadlock itself if a SIGCHLD arrives just before it calls select(), 
but after it has checked whether its child_terminated. So when the 
select() is called, the SIGCHLD signal handler has already run and set 
the child_terminated flag, and there's nothing to wake the select().
The only real user-space solution to this is to have the SIGCHLD handler
somehow cause the select() to return immediately by e.g. writing a byte
to a looped pipe which is included in the select() readfd set, but this
seems a little contrived. This patch simply adds a proc_base_poll()
method to make /proc/<pid> pollable, with the following semantics:
- /proc/<your_pid>/ returns POLLHUP if you have any unreaped zombie
children.
- /proc/<your_child_pid>/ returns POLLHUP if the specified child is a
zombie or has been reaped.
- Any other /proc/<pid>/ directory returns POLLNVAL, as we've no way to
do a proper poll() on it - only a parent's wait_chldexit wait queue is
awakened when a process exits, so other processes won't get any kind of
notification.
So by including /proc/self in the readset for select(), you can 
guarantee that select()/poll() will return if you've just received (and 
handled) a SIGCHLD, but not yet reaped the child. 
Alternatively, you could block SIGCHLD and just use select() for both
your child notifications and your I/O notifications. In this case, it
becomes a very specialised case of the sigopen() that Dan Kegel
proposed, but is minimally intrusive (consisting of just a single method
added to proc_base_operations).
If do_notify_parent() were changed to wake up tsk->wait_chldexit as well
as its parent's wait_chldexit, then sensible semantics could be added
for polling on any /proc/<pid>/ dir - just do a pollwait() on the target
process' exit_childwait queue. Provided that the target task is properly
refcounted (which should occur naturally due to the existence of the 
/proc/<pid>/ inode), this should be safe. Would anyone have objections
to (or enthusiasm for) such a patch?
