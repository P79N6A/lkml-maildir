Hi,
I just upgraded to kernel 2.4.0 test 7 on RH 6.2.  While running
xosview or grkellm it shows 100% system usage which is incorrect.
If I do a cat /proc/stat it looks like this
cpu 35235 0 245123 0(1st and 3rd #'s made up)
From reading the man page I know the 3rd and 4th numbers shouldn't 
be zeros.  If I go back to kernel 2.2.14 the problem goes away.
I browsed through the archive be didn't see any soultion.  So any
help will be appreciated.
