I was asking because We crashed, while using this driver, AND LVM.

In this way, you mean, that it is not an issue since you guys don't try
to use LVM.

We've removed LVM from the config, per Michael's issue and
recommendation, but I'm just scared that we *could* see this issue with
XFS and Qlogic. Since you're saying the 6.01 has no stack clobbering
issues, then is it XFS, LVM and Qlogic?

I'm going to try, but we've got to get up and in production ASAP. Since
it takes *days* to cause the crash, I don't know how I can cause it  and
get the stack dump.
