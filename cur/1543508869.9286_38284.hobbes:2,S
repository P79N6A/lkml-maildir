I'm still digging into this. I do have some ideas what may be involved. There
are about three different cases here
1.	VIA chipset bug	-	known, understood, non SMP
2.	A few triton boards - 	probably a hardware issue
3.	SMP		-	looks like a lock bug.
Running the ikd patch is the best help here. I think it will show you a
spinlock deadlock. The trace from that should find the guilty party
