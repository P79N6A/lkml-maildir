Hi Folks,
I am hoping someone can help me out.  I am trying to change the value of the
SG_BIG_BUFF in /usr/include/scsi/sg.h to something greater than 32768
(preferably 131072).  I've fully recompiled the kernel (make dep; make clean
install modules modules_install) on v2.2.9, v2.2.9, and v2.2.5, rebooted and
the cat /proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff value still says 32768.
How can I change this value and make it show up to what I changed it to?
TIA!
Heather
