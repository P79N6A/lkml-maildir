yeah... but one of the kernels in question is actually 2.6.23.1, which
does use the 'precise' accounting.
Micah,
could you try to change either :
cat /proc/sys/kernel/sched_stat_granularity
put it to the value equal to a tick on your system
or just remove bit #3 (which is responsible for 8 == 1000) here:
cat /proc/sys/kernel/sched_features
(this one is enabled by default in 2.6.23.1)
anyway, when it comes to calculating rq->cpu_load[], a nice(0) cpu-hog
task (on cpu_0) may generate a similar load (contribute to
rq->cpu_load[]) as e.g. some negatively reniced task (on cpu_1) which
runs only periodically (say, once in a tick for N ms., etc.) [*]
The thing is that the higher a prio of the task, the bigger 'weight'
it has (prio_to_wait[] table in sched.c) ... and roughly, the load it
generates is not only 'proportional' to 'run-time per fixed interval
of time' but also to its 'weight'. That's why the [*] above.
so you may have a situation :
cpu_0 : e.g. a nice(-20) task running periodically every tick and
generating, say ~10% cpu load ;
cpu_1 : 2-3 nice(0) cpu-hog tasks ;
both cpus may be seen with similar rq->load_cpu[]... yeah, one would
argue that one of the cpu hogs could be migrated to cpu_0 and consume
remaining 'time slots' and it would not "disturb" the nice(-20) task
as :
it's able to preempt the lower prio task whenever it want (provided,
fine-grained kernel preemption) and we don't care that much of
trashing of caches here.
btw., without the precise load balancing, there can be situations when
the nice(-20) (or say, a RT periodic task) can be even not seen (i.e.
don't contribute to cpu_load[]) on cpu_0...
we do sampling every tick (sched.c :: update_cpu_load()) and consider
this_rq->ls.load.weight at this particular moment (that is the sum of
'weights' for all runnable tasks on this rq)... and it may well be
that the aforementioned high-priority task is just never (or likely,
rarely) runnable at this particular moment (it runs for short interval
of time in between ticks).
