  Hi,
2.5.45 doesn't boot for me.  I'm using a initrd to load some modules.
The last lines I see are:
  (1) RAMDISK telling me it has found a image.
  (2) initrd is freed
  (3) Oops.
2.5.44 used to print it has mounted the root fs (i.e. the initrd)
instead of oopsing.
I can hook up a serial console to grab the exact messages if needed.
  Gerd
