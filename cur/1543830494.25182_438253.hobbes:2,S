Yes, it is mainly a linker thing.  But the compiler has to emit the ".weak"
pseudo-op and not inline the function.

I didn't mark it inline.
If the compiler chose to inline it then that would be rather dumb of it,
given that it had the weak attribute.  But yes, paranoia says we should be
tagging this noinline too.
