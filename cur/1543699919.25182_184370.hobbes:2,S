I have an Asus A7N8X deluxe rev. 2, so no BIOS updates. I am running
2.6.0-test11-wli-2 with your(Ross Dickson) two patches that I diffed
for 2.6.  Default delay times, 19hrs uptime, grep tested.
..APIC TIMER ack delay, reload:25053, safe:25038
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:24988 
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:24954 
..APIC TIMER ack delay, predelay count:25011
