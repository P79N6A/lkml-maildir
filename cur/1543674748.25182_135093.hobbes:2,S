The fact that it's a "bandaid" and that it "destroys priority-based
timeslice scheduling" makes it a shenanigan. If you're having problems
solved by capping timeslices, you have someone's timeslice and/or
priority growing too large for some reason.
It'd be far better to help figure out what went wrong.
