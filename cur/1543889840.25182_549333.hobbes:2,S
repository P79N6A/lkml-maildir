Hi everybody,
unfortunately Andrew's path can be proven to be wrong:
There is no bug in the ACPI area at all.
I reverted the following modules in 2.6.22-rc2-mm1:
--- linux-2.6.22-rc2/drivers/net/b44.c	2007-05-19 02:24:07.000000000 -0700
+++ devel/drivers/net/b44.c	2007-05-22 21:55:36.000000000 -0700
AND:
--- linux-2.6.22-rc2/drivers/net/b44.h	2007-04-25 23:42:17.000000000 -0700
+++ devel/drivers/net/b44.h	2007-05-22 21:55:36.000000000 -0700
AND:
--- linux-2.6.22-rc2/drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c	2007-05-19 
02:24:07.000000000 -0700
+++ devel/drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c	2007-05-22 21:55:36.000000000 -0700
AND:
--- /dev/null	2007-05-07 19:14:32.301975000 -0700
+++ devel/drivers/usb/host/ohci-ssb.c	2007-05-22 21:55:36.000000000 -0700
RESULT:
Broadcom 4401 is working purrfectly! YUP!
Apart from that the kernel configuration menu of 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 is highly 
confusing:
Kernel Config differences:
In kernel 2.6.21.2 you are bound to go:
EISA, VLB, PCI and onboard controllers Y
Broadcom 4400 ethernet support m
Whereas in Kernel 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 is completely confusing:
1. There is a menu called Sonics Silicon Backplane, which does not
exist in 2.6.21.2.
2. In Section Network device support Y
Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit) Y
you got 2 confusing choices:
Option A:
EISA, VLB, PCI and onboard controllers Y
Broadcom 4400 ethernet support m
Broadcom 4400 PCI device support y
This enables "Sonic Silicon Backplane support m"
OR, and this is in fact confusing:
Option B:
Leave OUT (!!!) EISA, VLB, PCI and onboard controllers Y
Simply: Broadcom 4400 ethernet support m
This enables "Sonic Silicon Backplane support m"
Option B is proved to be working with the patch against the b44.c module
reverted  in 2.6.22-rc2-mm1.
If it is NOT reverted, Option B fails, but the confusion stays:
You do not get the idea whether
"Support for SSB on PCI bus host m" is necessary or not!
And above that, THIS ONE:
"Broadcom 4400 ethernet support m"
should never appear when THIS one:
"EISA, VLB, PCI and onboard controllers Y"
is DESELECTED, should it??
And that's it exactly what I meant when I mentioned that the ATTACHMENT of ssb 
to b44 is highly buggy!
I hope, Michael, that you believe that now.
If you need lspci -v or / and dmesg to prove that I am right and you are 
wrong:
Pleasure for me, just ask please!
Cheers
Uwe
P. S.: In clear words:
I higly suspect that simply the kernel config bindings are highly buggy and 
chaotic.
