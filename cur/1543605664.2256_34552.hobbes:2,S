I have never done this comparison myself, but I was wondering how ugly 
it would be if stable versions of Andrea's and Rik's VMs were both 
available in your/Linus' kernel as compile-time options.  Assuming that 
each provides better performance under certain conditions, wouldn't 
being able to choose a VM make sense, if they don't step on the rest of
the kernel too much ...
