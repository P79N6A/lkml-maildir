Hi Jeff,
I'm submitting a patch series for inclusion in netdev#upstream.
Here is a brief description:
-	MAC hang workaround update
-	Modify max HW Rx coalescing size
-	Log SGE doorbell Fifo overflow
-	Use Tx immediate data for offload packets whenever possible
-	RDMA can get internal mem info to workaround HW issues
-	More validity checks on connection ids
-	Stop MAC when a fatal error is detected
-	Log HW serial number
-	Update internal mem operating mode
-	Update engine microcode management, version is now 1.1.0
-	Update FW management, version is now 4.6.0
-	Ignore some HW errors until the HW is initialized
-	Check MSI/MSI-X after it got enabled
Cheers,
Divy
