The problem is the following:
I AM A NEWBIE!!! 
Well i had some questions about the linux kernel compilation and some of you 
gave me some real goos answeres, however, there is an issue which keeps 
buzzing my head and that i can't understand!
Some one told me i should edit the loop.c file and even tried to explained me 
why but i couldn't understand.
He said something about my new kernel wouldn't be able to compile if two or 
three lines weren't comented!
I didn't understand this fact so i would like to know why should i edit the 
/usr/src/linux/drivers/block/loop.c file!!!!
Plz some one explain me this fact.
tks for your attention, Astinus
If i wasn't explicit enough plz tell me! So i can reformulate my e-mail post!
once again tks for your attention.
