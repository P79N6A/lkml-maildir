I am submitting a new serial driver for the 2.6 series of kernels.
Description:
Digi serial driver for the Digi Neo and Classic PCI serial port
products.
IBM has requested this submission into the Linux kernel.
The patch is quite large (300K uncompressed), so rather than attach it
I am submitting a link to our ftp site where the patch is located.
