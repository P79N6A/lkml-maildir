Hi,
2 comments just from an end-user perspective:
1. netscape 6.2 is nowhere near stable anyway -
I'd recommend either netscape 7-pr1, or a
recent mozilla (1.0, 1.1b or latest nightly)
2. Try one of the "enhanced" kernels, e,g,
2.4.19-rc3-ac2 or 2.4.19-rc3aa1 - they have
bugfixes and performance enhancements
