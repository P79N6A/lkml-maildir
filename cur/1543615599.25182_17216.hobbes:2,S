the common case is that max_mapped doesn't reach zero, so either ways
(mainline or -aa) it's the same (i.e. no special exit path).

Correct. Incidentally swap or no swap doesn't make any difference on the
exit-path of shrink_cache in -aa (furthmore if swap is full or if everything is
unfreeable I stop wasting an huge amount of time on the swap_out path at the
first failure, this allows graceful oom handling or it would nearly deadlock
there trying tp swap unfreeable stuff at every max_mapped reached). In -aa
max_mapped doesn't influcence in any way the exit path of shrink_cache.
max_mapped only controls the swapout-frequency. See:
		if (!page->mapping || page_count(page) > 1) {
			spin_unlock(&pagecache_lock);
			UnlockPage(page);
		page_mapped:
			if (--max_mapped < 0) {
				spin_unlock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
				shrink_dcache_memory(vm_scan_ratio, gfp_mask);
				shrink_icache_memory(vm_scan_ratio, gfp_mask);
#ifdef CONFIG_QUOTA
				shrink_dqcache_memory(vm_scan_ratio, gfp_mask);
#endif
				if (!*failed_swapout)
					*failed_swapout = !swap_out(classzone);
				max_mapped = orig_max_mapped;
				spin_lock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
			}
			continue;
			
		}
So it should work just fine as far I can tell.
