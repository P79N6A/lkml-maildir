Don't waste too much time with it, this is an ugly hack by design
already, for two reasons:
1. It really ought to be part of gcc.  Gcc needs  a
   -Wstack-per-function option that will give a warning whenever the
   stack for any function exceeds some user-defined value.  alloca()
   will exceed any value.
2. We don't care much about the usage per function, but for a complete
   code path.  An expanded checker to do this already exists, I'm
   merely not allowed to give it to anyone.  Lawyers.
Apart from that, go ahead and have fun!
