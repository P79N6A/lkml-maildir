Hi!
...seems to work okay, except that mixers are strangely renumbered in
aumix. PCM2 has to be set to high if I want to hear something. Master
volume does not do anything.
Dmesg tells me:
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.2c (Thu Feb 05 15:41:49 2004 UTC).
via82xx: Assuming DXS channels with 48k fixed sample rate.
         Please try dxs_support=1 or dxs_support=4 option
         and report if it works on your machine.
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:11.5 to 64
usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using address 2
codec_read: codec 0 is not valid [0xfe0000]
codec_read: codec 0 is not valid [0xfe0000]
codec_read: codec 0 is not valid [0xfe0000]
codec_read: codec 0 is not valid [0xfe0000]
ALSA device list:
  #0: VIA 8235 at 0x1400, irq 22
With dxs_support=1 mixers were also renumbered, maybe in slightly
different way.
