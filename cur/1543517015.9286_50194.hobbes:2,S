For some reason ifconfig refuses me to bring up a second interface using
2.3.29.  Both cards are tulip based.
[root@gateway /root]# ifconfig eth1 up
SIOCSIFFLAGS: Resource temporarily unavailable
although I can ping machines connected to that interface, but I can define
routes without that device showing an up statis.
Anything known about this?  2.2.12 from RH6.1 works without a problem with
the same devices defined.
I tried using tulip 0.91g with the same results.
Any other info needed, please let me know and I'll report it right away.
Thanks
