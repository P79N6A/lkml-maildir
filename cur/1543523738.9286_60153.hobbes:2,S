    But mknod(8) doesn't, and userland daemons like MAKEDEV pass around
    majors and minors like candy;  since MAKEDEV is the only userland
    app that I know about that does poke around in /proc/devices, it's
    the format I'm paying attention to.   If Unix-compatability isn't
    very high on your list, a hack to mknod(8) to accept a single dev_t
    argument would nicely circumvent that problem.

    If I scream about register_disk() changing, nobody will pay attention
    to me.   /proc/devices, being part of procfs and therefore Unclean,
    is less likely to being changed out from under me without warning.

    Nope.  My install floppy already compresses the rootfilesystem. I
    could get back 180k if I discarded the whole scsi layer and instead
    used bios int14 to talk to disks, but then I'd have to either carry
    around two separate kernels (a stripped down one for the installer,
    and a fully-bloated one for the core Mastodon package) or I'd need
    to tweak the kernel so I could inherit-mount drivers on top of an
    int14 base.

    david parsons \bi/ I could just discard the spiffy pcmcia autoloading,
                   \/                             but That Would Be Wrong.
