No all the machines are single Celeron 300A Machine with 64Mb or 128Mb Ram and 
IDE Disk, my workstation is a Celeron 300A overclocked to 450Mhz with 128Mb 
ram and an ASUS P2B.

well you were wrong :) but a second test today show that the machine freeze
w/o a message with a load of 24, but the machine normal load is 1 o 0.5 , so
is ok for me. and yeah swap usage is 0, and normally it is around 2 or 3 megs
of swal allocated just on startup.... IDE disk almost report no heavy work.
the machine is running MySQL and cistron-radiusd. in a 2.3.5 w/o patches there
is a lot of HD work, with your patches the work on the IDE disk is almost none.

no 2.3.5 vanilla works great. i check your patch and there is no modification 
to the IDE Subsystem. also as i'm writing this mail i'm testing you patch again
and the ide cdrom is working great :( seems to be a random problem. right now
i'm burining the CDROM and the IDE CDROM is working w/o problems. 
is strange when i write the e-mail i reboot the machine twice and both time
the problems appears.. and now it didn't show up...

maybe, but right now i'm unable to reproduce the problem... well i'll keep
trying to make the bug show again...
