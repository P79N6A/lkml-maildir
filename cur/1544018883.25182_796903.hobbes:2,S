If the initial state is not set when the input device is set up, the
first docking event after the module is loaded will be lost.

Patch is based on what is done for the LID switch in drivers/acpi/button.c 
and has been tested on my HP 2510p.
As this is a (minor) bug fix, it would be nice to have it in 2.6.29.
Cheers,
FJP
