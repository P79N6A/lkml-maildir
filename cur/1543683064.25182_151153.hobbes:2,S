And also how big your icache is, and maybe even cpu/bus ratio, etc... 
which depend on the arch of course.
So as I saw Ihar suggest earlier in this thread, perhaps there should 
be two inline directives: must_inline (for code whose correctness 
depends on it) and could_help_performance_inline. Then different archs 
could #define could_help_performance_inline as appropriate.
