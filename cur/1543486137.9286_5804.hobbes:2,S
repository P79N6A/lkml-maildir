You are right, it's the exec sys call, try with the static linked ls that
normally comes with a ftpd, you will get same error:
star:/home/ftp/bin # file ls
ls: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically linked,
stripped
	# is not dynamically linked....
star:/home/ftp/bin # ./ls
bash: ./ls: No such file or directory
star:/root # ldd /home/ftp/bin/ls
ldd: can't execute /home/ftp/bin/ls (No such file or directory)
I had to recompile ls to make it run in our ftp server running 2.2.1. With
2.0.36 works nice (using same libraries, I've never installed glibc on
this machine).
Best regards.
