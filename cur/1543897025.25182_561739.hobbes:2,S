I disagree. How could the scheduler know that you care more about the media
player than the DVD ripping program? Maybe you're just watching unimportant
stuff to waste time while anxiously waiting for the DVD rip to finish.
Why should the scheduler make assumptions about what's important to the
user? If the user has priorities, they should tell the scheduler.
