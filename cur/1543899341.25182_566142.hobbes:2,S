Come to speak of it, I think you can have it much easier by having the kernel
exporting the cpio image as a virtual file inside rootfs, so that you could
re-extract it inside a tmpfs. In other words:
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt;
cd /mnt;
cpio -diuv </initramfs.cpio;
#
# switch_root nukes rootfs, pivot_roots and execs some init
klibc_switch_root .; # or something like that
Of course this needs double the memory than directly mounting tmpfs as 
rootfs, but it's an idea too.
