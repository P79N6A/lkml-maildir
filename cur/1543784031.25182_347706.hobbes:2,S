Except that it doesn't work in that primary case, where the SPI devices
are physically decoupled from any given SPI (master) controller.
One expansion card uses CS1 for a touchscreen; another uses CS3 for
SPI flash ... the same "cs table" can't handle both configurations.
It's got to be segmented, with devices separated from controllers.
Plus, that depends on standardizing platform_data between platforms.
That's really not the model for platform_data!  And "struct clk" is
ARM-only for now, too ...

Yes, I plan to follow up to that with comments.  As with Dmitry's
proposal, it's modeled closely on I2C, and is in consequence larger
than needed for what it does.
One reason I posted this driver-model-only patch was to highlight how
minimal an SPI core can be if it reuses the driver model core.  I'm
not a fan of much "mid-layer" infrastructure in driver stacks.
