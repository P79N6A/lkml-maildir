But Andre M.Hedrick said:

I don't know what is back or middle - my drive is as usual in the front;
no other devices on the disk cable - only the cdrom on other cable.

I don't think it is some kind of noise or grounding problem as everything with the graphics
and I must emphesize <everything> is ok, except when logining on textmode regular console
and activating mc - there is some part of a second distortion.

You see Vladimir:  what upsets me is that I have most ever standart computer:
ide 5.1 Quantum disk, 
P2 processor and Motherboard, 
3d rage pro xpret@work 8M g.card 
atx box,
regular modem 36.6,
regular acer cdrom x27
64Mb best memory.
Nokia 15inch Monitor.
Award Bios 4.51
kernel 2.2.2
everything is regular, standart, known manufactorers and should give good performance,
but instead I get plenty of problems:
*the above distortion
*apm hardly works and power on halt works only with enabling apm in the bios - which have
 no connection
*DMA makes problems so I work without it (~4 times slower).
*Mouse in gpm is ok, but inside X middle button doesn't work - and I tryed everything,
 now I work with the middle emulation.
these problems are from the moment I bought the computer half year ago.
it is not a cheap one and from reliable store.
Linux is the perfect,ultimative OS, but these problems 'make me problems'.
Thanks,
Pavel.
