I only tested with gcc 4.0 and 4.1 prereleases where it worked just fine.
 __asm__ __volatile__( LOCK_PREFIX
                "btrl %1,%0"
                :"+m" (ADDR)
                :"dIr" (nr));
I tried to covert them from +m to explicit input/output
arguments ("=m" (ADDR) : "0" (ADDR)) to fix your compiler 
but with that I get the the same warning as you with 3.4 with 4.0.
Don't know how else it could be written. 
Ok one could just pass the address and do a full memory clobber, but 
that would be a overly large sledgehammer for the problem.
Jan or Andreas - do you have any suggestions how to fix this or should
we revert back to the old (technically wrong) state which was
    __asm__ __volatile__( LOCK_PREFIX
                "btrl %1,%0"
                :"=m" (ADDR)
                :"dIr" (nr));
Thanks,
-Andi
