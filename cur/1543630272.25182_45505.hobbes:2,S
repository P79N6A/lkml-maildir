For your example, the result is:
<jsimmons@heisenberg.transvirtual.com>
        A bunch of fixes.
        Pmac updates
        Some more small fixes.
<rmk@arm.linux.org.uk>
        [PATCH] 2.5.13: vmalloc link failure
        
        The following patch fixes this, and also fixes the similar problem in
        scsi_debug.c:
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no>
        [PATCH] in_ntoa link failure
        
        Nothing serious. Whoever it was that did that global replacemissed a
        spot is all...
<viro@math.psu.edu>
        [PATCH] change_floppy() fix
        
        Needed both in 2.4 and 2.5
IMHO, it doesn't make much sense.
