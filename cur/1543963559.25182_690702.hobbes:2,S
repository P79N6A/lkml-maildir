yes, there's been a lot of back and forth.
Paul/Peter/Max, what's the current agreed-upon approach to merge these 
physical resource isolation features into cpusets intelligently while 
still keeping the whole thing as usable and practical to down-to-earth 
sysadmins as possible? That is the issue that is blocking this whole 
topic from progressing.

none of this is upstream yet (nor is any of this even near to being 
ready for upstream), so there's nothing to revert.
