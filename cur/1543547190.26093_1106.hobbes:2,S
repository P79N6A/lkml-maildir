Yes, but it is no good if you switch between different kernel versions as
you will get error messages about System.map being the wrong version number
(unless you copied it every time you boot a different kernel, of course).
/lib/modules/<release> is a much more natural place, IMHO.
I would even go so far as to say that procps should look there first before
looking in /boot.
