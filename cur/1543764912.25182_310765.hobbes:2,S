Checking "what will be transferred when I push" doesn't sound hard - the
push itself is not too trivial, but solvable. Perhaps even by pure
rsync, if you won't support updating tracked trees (does not sound
overwhelmingly useful anyway).
Checking "what will be transferred if I pull" is much worse. Perhaps you
could make a parallel objects repository, fetch all the newer commit and
tree metadata there, and then do diff-tree. I think you need something
smarter than rsync for that, though.
[git-pasky] As long as you are not pulling from a tracked branch, the
worst what can happen is that the enemy will trick you to pulling some
terabytes of data. Or overwrite existing objects with garbage, but
--ignore-existing would solve that trivially.

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
