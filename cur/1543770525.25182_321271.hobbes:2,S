Not commenting on your specific patch here, just the bit about what the 
point is of using explicitly signed chars. C doesn't define if chars are 
signed or unsigned by default, that's up to the implementation. So if it 
matters to you that chars should be either signed or unsigned you have to 
explicitly specify them as signed or unsigned.
I haven't read the code you change, not the patch, so I don't know if it's 
an issue, but there are certainly arguments for explicitly specifying  
signed char  or  unsigned char  in C code.
