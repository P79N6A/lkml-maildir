What I want the feature to do is allow users to set an
RSS rlimit to prevent a process from hogging up all the
machine's memory.
I am not looking for a hard memory limit, since that
would just cause extra IO, which has bad consequences
for the rest of the system.
In addition, I would like the patch to be relatively
low impact, not giving us much maintenance overhead or
much runtime overhead.
If anybody has good reasons for needing hard per-process
RSS limits, let us know.  So far I haven't seen anybody
with a workload that somehow requires a hard limit.
