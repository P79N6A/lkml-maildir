Hi Ondrej,
Thanks for your reminding, I will put the configuration file to Documentation/fb next time.
As I know, it should contains some other modes. l check with our engineers later.
BRs,

Configuration file for fbset definitely shouldn't be here between C source files. If it is needed, then it should be somewhere in Documentation/fb .
BTW, Are these modes common VESA modes (DVT, GTF or CVT)  or some other modes. In first case there is probably no reason to include them.
