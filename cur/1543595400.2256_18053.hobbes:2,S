It does mean there is an order, as defined below.

I typed it in and forgot an "are".  Forgive me, but this doesn't
change the point, and you could have easily looked in the standard
yourself to see where I mistyped.

No.  The C standard does not guarantee that const items be placed in
RO memory.  It does not even require that the host have RO memory, or
that an implementation do the same thing with a const object as a
const member of a structure.

Geez, would you rather I scan it for you?

Of course it knows where things are, since a structure is a single
contiguous range of memory, according to the standard.
Would you care to offer counter citations?  Have you even looked at
the standard?
