Subject: [patch 00/46] High resolution timer / dynamic tick update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a full replacement queue for the high resolution timer / dynamic 
ticks implemementation in -mm.
This version includes the following improvements:
 - Seperate clockevents management of devices and users
 - Provide a generic tick managament infrastructure, which makes use
   of the clock events management layer. This provides:
   - periodic tick management
   - broadcast management (e.g. to solve the APIC stops in C3 power
     state problem)
   - dynamic tick core functionality
   - high resolution timer core infrastructure
   This allows to provide dynamic ticks with low and high resolution
   timers by sharing the infrastructure. [read: CONFIG_NO_HZ=y is now
   available without CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS as well.]
   ( The dynamic tick implementation also contains a fix for the
     generic next_timer_interrupt() function, which did not do the
     cascade lookups correctly. )
 - Provide a generic way to verify clocksources. TSC needs
   verification due to broken hardware and BIOS implementations. The
   previous attempt to allow TSC usage for high resolution and/or
   dynamic ticks only in combination with the PM-Timer made hardwired
   assumptions, which are ugly to maintain. The new verification code
   solves this by chosing the best available clocksource for
   verification and handles the usability check for highres / dynamic
   ticks. This makes TSC code agnostic of other hardware available in
   the system.
 - Removed the dynamic tick specific parts from the high resolution
   timer code.
 - Dynamic ticks and high resolution timers can be disabled separately
   at compile time or at run time from the kernel command line.

Sorry for the resend. Did not notice my list typo. :(
