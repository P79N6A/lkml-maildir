Hi
include/linux/netlink.h says: #define NLMSG_ALIGNTO 4
I think NLMSG_ALIGNTO should be 8 because the data may be a
struct containing a 64 bit member which requires 64 bit
alignment. In this case NLMSG_DATA will not work properly if
NLMSG_LENGTH(0) % 8 != 0.
Currently this is a "theoretical" issue as
sizeof(struct nlmsghdr) == 16.
Do you agree that the definition of NLMSG_ALIGNTO should
be changed?
Regards,
Thomas
