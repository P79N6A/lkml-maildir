Subject: [2.6 patch] remove broken and unmaintained Sangoma drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The in-kernel Sangoma drivers are both not compiling and marked as 
BROKEN since at least kernel 2.6.0.
Sangoma offers out-of-tree drivers, and David Mandelstam told me Sangoma 
does no longer maintain the in-kernel drivers and prefers to provide 
them as a separate installation package.
This patch therefore removes these drivers.
