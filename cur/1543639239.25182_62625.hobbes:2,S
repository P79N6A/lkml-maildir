Hm, now that it looks like this is going to be necessary for cPCI
hotplug drivers, could you make up a 2.5 version of it?
The code should only be compiled in if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_CPCI is
enabled, and hopefully with the splitup of the PCI code in the 2.5 tree,
you should be able to contain it to one file, much like this patch has.

Move this #ifdef to a header file file, so it doesn't show up in the .c
file.
