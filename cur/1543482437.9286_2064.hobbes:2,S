I suggest to get rid of the bogus readX/writeX stuff in drivers that 
know what they are doing, until 2.3, as follows:
#if defined(__i386__)	/* i386 implements full FLAT memory/MMIO model */
#undef the stuff that does not work for __i386__ with PCI MMIO regions  
       mapped in high address space and ioremapped, then:
#define readb(a)	(*(volatile unsigned char *) (a))
#define readw(a)	(*(volatile unsigned short *) (a))
#define readl(a)	(*(volatile unsigned int *) (a))
#define writeb(b,a)	((*(volatile unsigned char *) (a)) = (b))
#define writew(b,a)	((*(volatile unsigned short *) (a)) = (b))
#define writel(b,a)	((*(volatile unsigned int *) (a)) = (b))
#else etc ...
And obviously to _not_ use phys_to_virt() that seems to only make sense 
on a single O/S.
BTW, already done in the development 896 driver.
