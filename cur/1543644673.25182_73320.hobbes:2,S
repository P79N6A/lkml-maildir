Wanted.
Example: In desktop / consumer applications, you can use link-state change to 
do things like invoke the DHCP client daemon, or get yourself a link-local IP 
address.

I liked the /sbin/hotplug arrangement (aka call_usermode_helper). In fact, my 
plan was to add the call_usermode_helper call to the netif_carrier_[on,off] 
functions. Unfortuantely, I've been to too many of Rusty's talks, and know 
that calling a function that is only safe in user context is unlikely to be a 
good idea in netif_carrier_[on,off], which are more than likely running in 
interrupt context.
Conceptually, I don't see (hot-plugging) a CAT-5 cable into a NIC to be that 
much different (from a userland view) to plugging the NIC into the PCI bus.
My big problem is that I am clueless, and call_usermode_helper isn't nice 
code. If someone in kernel-land could make call_usermode_helper safe in 
interrupt context, at least link-state reporting would be fairly trivial. It 
shouldn't be that hard - it's already using keventd. I just have no idea 
about clone_thread and stuff like that.
