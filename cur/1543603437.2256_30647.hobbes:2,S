I don't think this will be very rewarding, as a lot of very important
contributors aren't listed in this file (if I remember correctly,
Alexander Viro, the guru of VFS-design, is one example, all the people
behind my all-time favourite project, the Standford-checker, is another
example), hence this file is pretty useless.
