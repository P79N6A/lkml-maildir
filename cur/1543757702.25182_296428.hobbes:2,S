Yes, though they'll come up a bit later than the rest of the world if
the driver can't resume them itself (which is what should happen
normally, running the BIOS on resume is a hack).
Also, as I wrote earlier, what we care about now is the API in the form
of a helper. It fits well to have that helper just do something similar
to the firmware loader, running the stuff in userspace, but that isn't
mandatory, we could change later to be in-kernel, partially, or even
have a CONFIG option wether to have the emulator in kernel or not :)
The driver doesn't have to care if we provide a suitable API. And
userspace helper is a good enough implementation to start with.
Ben.
