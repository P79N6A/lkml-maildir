btw Gerd, did you see the patch I sent to the video4linux mailing list
last sunday? It includes some small fixes to make things much closer to
working (some +1/-1 type fixes). After that patch, the main open issue
is syncing the video scaling and audio muting settings between the two
video devices/chips (2388 and 23416) -> The cx23416 needs to be set to
the same (/related) video scaling settings as the 2388, and the 2388
audio must be unmuted for the mpeg stream to contain audio.
And of course then it needs some ioctl for the mpeg codec settings.
Jelle.
