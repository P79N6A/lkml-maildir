Yes. I think what happened is this:
	task1		task2
	-----		-----
	lock_sock(sk1)
			tcp_get_info()
			increase lhash users
			lock_sock(sk1)
			block
	tcp_listen_wlock()
	block
-> deadlock
Actually I am going to discover the exact path of task1 (the task2 path is
trivial, it's just a cat /proc/net/tcp) with this little debugging code.

When I'll know the path of task1 I'll be able to generate a fix.
