Just to add a bit to a general confusion. :-)  2.2.10-ac12 on LX164
(and before that 2.2.10-ac10 on DP264) is booting and running for me
just fine **without** a reversal of changes to 'core_pyxis.[ch]'.
The is a difference, though.  Instead of ncr53c8xx driver I am using
sym53c8xx (version 1.5c) from Gerard Roudier new stuff.

Maybe I miss something but it appeared to me that ncr53c8xx and sym53c8xx
are using PCI windows in the same manner.  My hardware decoding PCI lines
in a different way? (I am way beyond my competence in this moment).
I can see how 'core_pyxis' changes can mess-up UX though.
