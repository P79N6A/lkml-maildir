Not a kernel or ppp problem.
I rechecked out (I am not using ppp to connect) and everything works
like a charm even with my 'bizarre' configuration: pcmcia modem, RH52
kernel, 2.2.3-ac4 and ppp-2.3.6 (
ftp://ftp.ulpgc.es/pub/ulpgc/ppp-2.3.6
*)
Simply using 'linuxconf' I got a running conection in seconds.
