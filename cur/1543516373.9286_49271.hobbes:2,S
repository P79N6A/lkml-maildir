On my pm7200 the kernel enters the xmon after the line:
loop: registered device at major 7
Then addresses and values are printed out and finally the line 'kernel
entered xmon' or something like that.
I have to reproduce it.
After the line above (loop:...) normally the fd0: SWIM3 floppy
controller is initialized. 
As far as I saw, in pre6 there are no explicite changes made on ppc.?
pre5 went ok for the last days.
Thanks for any hint
Andreas
