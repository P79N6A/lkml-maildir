Arjan did a review of the replacement and I'm in the process to go
through that and Romans comments again. I'll add a complete list of the
review issues and the resolution state. Sorry that this was delayed, but
I was busy regression testing and hunting nasty details in the last
weeks.

Timekeeping is mostly untouched and the APIC change was done to solve
real world issues:
- lapic verification gets stuck for ever
- lapic timer runs too fast

If I understand it correctly, Roman wants clockevents to be usable for
other things aside hrtimer/dyntick, i.e. let other code request unused
timer event hardware for special purposes. I thought about that in the
originally but I stayed away from it, as there are no users at the
moment and I wanted to avoid the usual "who needs that" comment. Granted
that clockevents is not perfect, but it's rather self contained and has
no user space exposure, so it can be replaced by something better
anytime.
