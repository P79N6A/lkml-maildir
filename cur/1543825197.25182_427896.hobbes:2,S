Hi,

bttv is a monolithic driver for all devices using Bt8x8 chipsets,
whereas saa7146 and saa7146_vv only hold the core infrastructure that is
common for all saa7146 cards.
saa7146 does not know anything about a card, but the so-called extension
driver (like mxb, hexium_orion or dpc7146) does. It holds the PCI IDs
and is responsible for telling the system what card it supports and do
any probing if necessary.
I don't know where to put the card=xx parameter in that case, because
the hexium_orion does not know mxb nor dpc7146. 8-(
Since these cards don't have subvendor/subdevice IDs, it's impossible to
find out which card is in the system.
CU
Michael.
