I appreciate the help but please don't do this. You're creating more
work for me and confusion to the maintainers now. If Andrew already
picked up my patch, your new patch will not apply. If he didn't, he
cannot use your patch either because you left out the kfree() part
completely. Manfred said he would send a separate patch so please
respect that.
Andrew, please apply the original patch I sent and ignore the follow up
patches to this thread.
