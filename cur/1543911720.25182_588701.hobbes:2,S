It would be possible with the MAJOR() and MINOR() macros to do this...
however it doesn't really help out much during troubleshooting. I
tried using the bdevname function like the function that calls this
one uses, however, it wants a struct device_block... which I tried
getting with:
container_of(dev, struct block_device, bd_dev)
Of course this didn't quite work out, I got kernel panics on my two
trial attempts.
Here's a skip from a dmesg where I added a printk right under the line
in question.
