I see.

So then isn't the optimal record size 8192 for r/wsize=8192?  Since the
data is going to be grouped into 8192-byte reads and writes over the wire,
shouldn't bsize match that?  Why should I make 16x 512-byte write() syscalls
(if "optimal" I/O size is bsize=512) instead of 1x 8192-byte syscall?
SUSv3 says:
    unsigned long f_bsize    File system block size. 
    unsigned long f_frsize   Fundamental file system block size.
Solaris statvfs(2) says:
    u_long      f_bsize;             /* preferred file system block size */
    u_long      f_frsize;            /* fundamental filesystem block
                                         (size if supported) */
