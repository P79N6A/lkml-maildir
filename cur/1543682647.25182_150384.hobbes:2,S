Right away I can tell you there was no problem up to the pre that did not boot
on my box, I thing it was pre3, right? Meaing pre1 and pre2 work.
pre5 was the first one that booted again - and the first I can tell has the
problem.
I can "port" the mini-patch from chris back to pre3 and try this one as next
step...

Stephan
