Look at it from the semantical POV first, which is the most important
one.
semaphores are semantically different from mutexes, so they require
different APIs.
When you have semantically different APIs, you can still implement them
for whatever (e.g. peformance) reason on top of the same mechanism, but
you can not make this work the other way round.
