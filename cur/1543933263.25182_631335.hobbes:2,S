Hi
This patchset converts macros related to super_block handling into
functions. Besides that it fixes some sparse warnings (23rd and 24th),
improves coding style (1st) and fixes error handling (19th).
Note that udf files has really long lines and these patches won't validate
by checkpatch. I'm going to do more cleanups later.
PS: This is the first time I use git-send-email - tell me if I do something wrong.
