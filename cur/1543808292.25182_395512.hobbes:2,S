Answer in the task_struct.  It is the simplest and most flexible
route and the other implementations are still possible.

The answer seems to be we decide on a per namespace basis with
additional syscalls being mandatory if we have any additional data to
pass.

I have seen no arguments against referring to namespaces or containers
by global ids.  So it seems we do not need a container id.

Largely quite.  But I have not heard additional constraints.

Not yet resolved, but a bit of speculation.

A little discussion.  At the level of the last few cache line I
think this needs to be addressed when we merge.  Simply not
messing up existing optimizations sounds like a good initial
target.  Basically at this stage trying hard would be a 
premature optimization.

This look mostly like something to be discussed when we merge
namespaces.  But as long as we keep it in mind it is easy.
