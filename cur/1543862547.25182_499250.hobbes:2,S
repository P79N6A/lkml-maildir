My latest bisection attempt actually led to your sata_nv ADMA commit. [1]
I've now backed out that patch from 2.6.20-rc5 and have my stress test
running for 20 minutes now ("record" for a bad kernel surviving that
test is about 40 minutes IIRC). I'll keep it running for at least 2 more
hours.
The test is pretty simple:
while /bin/true; do ls -lR > /dev/null; done
while /bin/true; do echo 255 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; sleep 1; done
running in parallel.
