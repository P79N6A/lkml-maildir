Oh, I see. This in handle_IRQ_event in /kernel/irq/handle.c confirms what you said:
        do {
                ret = action->handler(irq, action->dev_id, regs);
                if (ret == IRQ_HANDLED)
                        status |= action->flags;
                retval |= ret;
                action = action->next;
        } while (action);
There is no escape from the loop when the handler returns IRQ_HANDLED.
Thanks,
