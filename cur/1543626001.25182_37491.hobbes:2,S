Fellow Linux Hackers.
I am starting to plan a new version of Supermount. I have some things I want
to try out in it, and I will list them in this message. I am willing to
accept any and all input on what I am wanting to call Supermount 2.
Planned features of Supermount 2:
1) Auto-detection of filesystem type.
2) Supermount modules for each filesystem type.
3) Built-in support for packet-writing. ( i.e. insert packet-writing
formatted disk and it loads appropriate kernel modules. )
There may be other features added if there is an interest in them. I will
need assistance with the packet-writing support. I am only planning to do
this for the 2.5.x and later kernels, so if anyone else wishes to back-port
it to an older kerenl series, by all means do so. I have wanted to make some
kind of contribution to this project for some time and I feel that this is
something that will be useful.
I am going to be making my prelminary code available to whomever wishes to
see it once I get my Linux box back up.
