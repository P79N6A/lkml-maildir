Yes, that's basically what Xen does - there's a nonlinear mapping from
kernel virtual to machine pages (and usermode pages are put through the
same transformation before being mapped).

Yes, any driver which expects contigious kernel pages to be physically
contigious will be sorely disappointed.  This isn't too hard to deal
with (since such drivers are often buggy anyway, making poor assumptions
about the relationship between physical addresses and bus addresses). 
An IOMMU could help as well.
