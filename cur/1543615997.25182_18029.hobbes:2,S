which reminds me of another initramfs issue. I noticed you included
dietlibc in the diethotplug (hence the name I guess), but has any
decision been made yet as to what's going to be chosen as an
initlibc/klibc ?
There are several small libc's out there, but I've not seen any
discussion either for or against any of them.
