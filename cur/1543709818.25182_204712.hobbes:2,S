Well, that's fine -- you can certainly define mlock to have whatever
semantics you want.  But the semantics that gpg depends on are
reasonable, and if mlock is changed to have other semantics, there
should be some way for apps to get the behavior that used to be
implemented by mlock (and *documented* in the mlock man page).
It's a pity that mlock doesn't take a flags argument.
