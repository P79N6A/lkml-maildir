DONT PANIC! It's only Win9X, nothing serious.
The problem is that you don't see the whole name on a VFAT partition.
As you'll know there are two parts to the name the 8+3 part and the
fakename but you can only see one bit at a time.
Suppose you do something like this:
mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /dos
tar cvf /dev/rmt0 /dos
This will save the fakename but not the 8+3 name, if you do a restore
linux will _normally_ regenerate the same 8+3 name, but not always.
"So what" you say, well it's like this; there are LFN programs that store
the 8+3 name not the long one, for example MS Office. If everything has
gone just right and the 8+3 name of one of the few bad files changes the
restore will fail for no visable reason.
So I'd like to put in a feature request to have a translation mode where
the entire name is visable. Perhaps something like this ...
If no longname use msdos translation
If shortname is "~1 " version of longname use longname
Otherwise use shortname=longname
or perhaps something even more ugly. The aim is obviously that a
backup+restore will preserve _both_ names guarenteed.
If it's combined with "nonumtail" the second rule would be modified to
suit.
BTW: Meantime the only way I've found to be sure you get both names is to
     use the W95 LFN backup program and backup the FS as an msdos not a vfat.
