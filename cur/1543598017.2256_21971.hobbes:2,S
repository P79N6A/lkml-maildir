	Granted, in some cases, I am in favor of the Linux kernel
being the innovator in violating some prevailing standards that I
regard as sufficientliy "broken at the core", like, say, the
popularity of really long variable names.  However, I think just about
nobody else in this discussion accepts the major premise of that
syllogism that min(n1,n2) is "broken to the core", at least not
to the degree that changing it that way is a fix.

	OK.
