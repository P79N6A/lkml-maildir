Can you give more details like
- Which distro release you are running.
- Exactly what changes did you do to /etc/init.d/reboot and what steps
did you follow to load the kernel (command line options).
- What do you see on screen? Did the new kernel start booting at all.
- Would be nice if I can get serial console output.

For normal kexec, no. You don't need any more patches.
