Well, the thing that hurts the 83820 is that its interrupt 
mitigation capabilities are rather limited.  This is where napi 
helps: by turning off the rx interrupt for the duration of packet 
processing, cpu cycles aren't wasted on excess rx irqs.
As to the lack of bandwidth, it stems from far too much interrupt 
overhead and the currently braindead attempt at irq mitigation.  
Since the last time I worked on it, a number of potential techniques 
have come up that should bring it into the 100MB realm (assuming it 
doesn't get trampled on by ksoftirqd).
