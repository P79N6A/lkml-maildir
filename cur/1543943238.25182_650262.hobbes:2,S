Ok, so, so far, the discussion stays opened about the new functionalities for c/r.
As there were no objection about the first patches, which rewrite/enhance the
existing code, Andrew, could you consider them (ie patches 1 to 8 of this
series) for inclusion in -mm ? (I mean, as soon as it is possible, as I guess
you're pretty busy for now with the merge for 2.6.25)
If you prefer, I can resend them separately ?
Thanks,
Pierre
