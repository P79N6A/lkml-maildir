Attached is a very small patch which fixes a problem with make xconfig with newer tk8.0.x
versions.
The option -fore is now ambiguous, this simply changes this to -foreground.
Without this fixed xconfig errors on several submenus.
This should be totally backwards compatible due to the nature of abbreviation handling
in tcl/tk.
