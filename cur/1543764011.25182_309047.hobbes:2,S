I wouldn't bet on it.  There used to be a queue - minus the 
timeout.  Throughput improved markedly with it's removal.
That said, yield()s in the kernel can be quite evil.  I once instrumented 
semaphores, and under hefty load, frequently found tasks waiting for a 
semaphore held by someone in the expired array.  When you've got a busy 
cpu, that wait can be _extremely_ painful.  The yield()s in mm/*.c are long 
gone (thank god), but after a quick grep/peek, I can imagine the one in 
free_more_memory() causing some throughput grief in a cpu intense 
environment, and the one in __wait_on_freeing_inode() would punt you into 
the dungeon while you're holding the inode lock... that looks like it could 
be pretty unpleasant.
