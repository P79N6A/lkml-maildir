Subject: [PATCH] IBM ServeRAID driver version 4.71 update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In the just-released Red Hat 7.1 source disk, the file kernel-2.4.2-2.src.rpm
contains linux-2.4.2-ips-471.patch. This looks like the official update
to kernel 2.4.X for the IBM ServeRAID driver.
I have not seen this patch published elsewhere.
Could we have this patch merged into the standard kernel, please?
For now, this patch applies cleanly to kernel 2.4.3.
