What is normally done here in Linux? A mass of people starts sending emails
to IBM to ask for ANY support, or do we have contacts? I have already
contacted the Linux developers that created the Linux driver for the
security chip for the IBM's and they had no clue of what they can do?
If this is the case, and there is no normal way for IBM to release the spec
or driver, then we will need to send emails to IBM, asking for the Linux
support. After all, they claim that they are all into Linux (not all, but
they kind of like it)
What should we do? askibm@info.ibm.com ? Should we go into the Query page
and ask them there? 
https://www.ibm.com/contact/us/en/query
Lenovo has the PC stuff of IBM, but still, they are fully into it and
therefore will be able to know what they can do here. The support is given
by IBM, not lenovo, they just sell the computers.
