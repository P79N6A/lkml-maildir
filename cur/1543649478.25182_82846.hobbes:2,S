Make sure the e1000 driver is tuned, try insmodding it with:
TxDescriptors=1024 RxDescriptors=4096
Also, in your user-space app, check the return code of your
packet-sending call.  That can let you know that the kernel
dropped it, and that you need to re-send.
How do you know you are dropping packets?  (Ie, are you also
reading on another machine?)  Usually it's read that drops
more packets than write.
Good luck,
Ben
