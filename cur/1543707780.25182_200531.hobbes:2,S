I seen the report and begain to create a patch. The module_init fix is 
easy. Just place module_init and module_exit under #ifdef MODULE. I 
realize alot of fbdev drivers do this wrong. I will make patches by the 
end of the day. As for the fbmem.c call on fb_console_init. Well that is 
tricker to deal with. I will have to figure out a way.
