Hi,
This is the weirdest crash I've come across related to an rc kernel.
First I tested .29-rc1 when it came out and firefox crashed only when 
clicking on certain links.
Now I updated my tree and compiled another kernel. This time firefox 
crashes right after it finishes loading my homepage.
This happens every time, and has never happened on any kernel before.
I did a strace of firefox and these are the last few lines that are 
always present before it crashes:
gettimeofday({1232129663, 344658}, NULL) = 0
gettimeofday({1232129663, 351300}, NULL) = 0
open(\"/home/justin/.mailcap\", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 ENOENT (No 
such file or directory)
time(NULL)                              = 1232129663
stat64(\"/home/justin/.gnome2/vfs/modules\", 0xbfec4efc) = -1 ENOENT (No 
such file or directory)
stat64(\"/etc/gnome-vfs-2.0/modules\", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, 
st_size=128, ...}) = 0
geteuid32()                             = 1000
getegid32()                             = 1000
getuid32()                              = 1000
tgkill(4615, 4642, SIGRT_1upeek: ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER,4615,44,0): No 
such process
So far I've tried other programs, but I haven't seen any other crashes.
