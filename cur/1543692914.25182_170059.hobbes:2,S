To allow efficient switching in and out of Xen we take a small amount
of every virtual address space, and also grab ring 0. Since we don't
hide that from overlying OSes, we couldn't do a full recursive
implementation of Xen -- we'd run out of rings (quickly) and address
space (eventually) :-) 
Full recursion needs full virtualization. Our approach offers much
better performance in the situations where full virtualization isn't
required -- i.e., where it's feasible to distribute a ported OS.
