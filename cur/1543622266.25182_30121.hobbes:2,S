The in-kernel prism driver doesn't seem to work with the built-in
wireless lan. But - from what I understand from the Configure.help,
this is what I'd expect - to me it looks like, linux will support
prism2 in either PCMCIA or PLX.
From the linux-wlan-ng driver, I need to compile "Prism2.5 native
PCI" to get a driver that will recognize the card...
