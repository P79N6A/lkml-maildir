I have a currious "problem" where abouts an older (ie not the latest) version of Norton Scan Disk for
Windows, (I'm using Win98) when doing its scan on boot, it anaylses the first hard disk, then starts
analysing my 2nd HD, where I have linux installed. It sits there anaylsing it for about 30 seconds, w/
no hd activity, then continues on to my 3rd, doing that as fast as the 1st.
I'm not sure why findfast would be looking at the partition table, but then again, you never know w/
non Open Source Software.
