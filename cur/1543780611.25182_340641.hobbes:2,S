Subject: [ANNOUNCE] yaird 0.0.11, a mkinitrd based on hotplug concepts

Version 0.0.11 of yaird is now available at:
	
http://www.xs4all.nl/~ekonijn/yaird/yaird-0.0.11.tar.gz
Yaird is a proof of concept perl rewrite of mkinitrd.  It aims to
reliably identify the necessary modules by using the same algorithms
as hotplug, and comes with a template system to to tune the tool for
different distributions and experiment with different image layouts.
It requires a 2.6 kernel with hotplug.  There is a paper discussing it at:
	
http://www.xs4all.nl/~ekonijn/yaird/yaird.html
Summary of user visible changes:
     * Support configuration file that determines what the generated
       image should do.  It replaces command line options for root
       file system selection and for NFS support.
     * The file /etc/hotplug/blacklist does not have to exist:
       this can be a machine without hotplug, or with a future
       hotplug version, where blacklisting is delegated to module-init-tools.
       Based on patch by Marian Andre <Marian.Andre@sq.sk>
     * Bugfix: expect characters A-Z, in kernel config entries.
     * Handle kernels that do not have ide-generic.
Changes in version 0.0.10 and 0.0.9 were too small to
merit an announcement:
     * Support legacy keyboard compiled as module.
     * Place the docs under GPL instead of GFDL for the benefit of Debian.
Regards,
Erik
