Could you please stop this ia64 paranoia and instead explain to me why
it's OK to relocate a PCI device to (0x100000000-PCI_dev_size)
temporarily?  That just seems horribly unsafe to me.  The PCI spec
seems to say the same as it says pretty clearly that memory decoding
should be disabled during BAR-sizing.  If certain bridges cause
problems, perhaps those need to be special-cased?
