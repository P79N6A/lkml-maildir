Greetings!
Y'all remember the past two messages where I posted about my machine
locking up when using Xterms to an X server on another box? Well, if you
don't, I finally was able to catch a lockup and see where EIP was. In my
case, <cleanup_module>. 
So, as an experiment I disabled the crontab job of "*/10 * * * * rmmod -a"
to see what the effect was.
Well, the effect was that my box hasn't crashed. Before, it would
reliably fail every 12 hours, 16 at the most. And I could force it by
opening/closing lots of Xterms and stuff.
Now I can't. It seems the "rmmod -a" was indeed the culprit. I'm going to
backstep and check out my modutils versions to see if I have some version
mismatching going on. 
But I wan't to let you know, modules were indeed my problem.
G'day!
