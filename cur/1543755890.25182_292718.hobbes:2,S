What is the proper way to setup a real counting semaphore under the
-RT kernel?
I've noticed that just using a struct semaphore, normal counting
semaphore usage[*] can trigger the "lock recursion deadlock" in
kernel/rt.c since 'struct semaphore' now uses an rt_mutex.  
What I've done for now is to use sema_init_nocheck() to disable the
checking in the case of a counting semaphore, but I remember seeing
discussion in an earlier thread about creating a separate counting
semaphore type.  Is this still planned?

[*] For example, an open semaphore being down'ed and thus acquired and
the same thread doing a down() again before another thread has a
chance to up() the semaphore.
