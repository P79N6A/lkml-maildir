Good idea for updatedb.
However, it may be a bad idea for files that are often
written to.  Turning an inode write into a read plus a
write does not sound like such a hot idea, we really
want to keep those in the cache.
I think what you need is to ignore multiple references
to the same page when they all happen in one time
interval, counting them only if they happen in multiple
time intervals.
The use-once cleanup (which takes a page flag for PG_new,
I know...) would solve that problem.
However, it would introduce the problem of having to scan
all the pages on the list before a page becomes freeable.
We would have to add some background scanning (or a separate
list for PG_new pages) to make the initial pageout run use
an acceptable amount of CPU time.
Not sure that complexity will be worth it...
