It uses POSIX shared memory and (necessarily) MAP_SHARED, which
doesn't constrain the mapping alignment.
I had wondered if some kernels used page faults to maintain coherence
between multiple shared mappings of the same file.  It's one of the
things the program checks, and I have seen it mentioned on l-k, which
made me think it might be implemented.  None of the results for any
architecture show it, though.
If userspace does create multiple shared mappings at non-coherent
offsets, what is the recommended method for switching between
accessing one page (or page cluster?) and accessing the other.  Is it
msync(), a special system call to flush parts of the data cache, a
machine instruction, or something else?
Thanks,

ps. The program has code to try IPC shm instead.  Change "#ifdef
SHM_DIR_PREFIX" in __page_alias_map to "#if 0", and add
-DHAVE_SYSV_SHM to the GCC command line.  It should fail the same test
sizes with a different message.
