That helps heaps, thanks.
Bisection shows that the crash (which seems to be a BUG) is due to
reduce-max_nr_zones-*.patch, and testing on the current -mm lineup
indicates that one of the two patches which Christoph sent
post-2.6.18-rc1-mm1 has fixed it.

We sometimes do comparisons like
xx & (__GFP_x| __GFP_y)) == GFP_y
This becomes a problem if GFP_y is redefined to be zero.
Both __GFP_HIGHMEM (caused by me) and __GFP_DMA32 (was this way before) can
become zero in order to cause a fall back to ZONE_NORMAL.
We also have a GFP_MASK that is applied before indexing into the nodelists
array.  We can use that mask to avoid having both become zero and instead
use the GFP_MASK to clear the respective bits before retrieving the
zonelist.
- Remove #ifdefs that cause __GFP_HIGHMEM or __GFP_DMA32 to become zero.
- GFP_MASK works nicely to cause fall back to ZONE_NORMAL except if
  CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32 and !CONFIG_HIGHMEM are set. In that case the
  fallback to ZONE_NORMAL does not work. So add a special case
  to mmzone.h to define a special mask that switches off the highmem
  bit for this particular configuration.

From: Christoph Lameter <clameter@sgi.com>
The __GFP_xx definitions in include/linux/gfp.h are used to refer to
individual bits in the GFP bitmasks.  I think they should not be
conditional via ifdef.  If a conditional definition is required then a
version without the underscore should be used.
My patch from yesterday cleared up the definitions that resulted in zero
values.  This one removes the #ifdef around __GFP_DMA32.
The x86_64 arch code is the only user of __GFP_DMA32 and x86_64 sets
CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32.  No driver is using DMA32.  So we do not really need
fall back behavior for ZONE_DMA32 at this point.
If ZONE_DMA32 would be used by a device driver in the future on a platform
that has not set CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32 then we will fall back to ZONE_NORMAL
because the __GFP_DMA32 bit is not set in GFP_ZONEMASK.  I think if
different behavior is desired then the device driver would have to take
care of falling back to a different allocation.  The absence of DMA32 slab
support may already force the device driver to deal with this case anyways.
Another solution would be to make the definition of GFP_DMA32 conditional
on CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32 and 32/64 bit.  That would leave the __GFP_xx
untouched.
