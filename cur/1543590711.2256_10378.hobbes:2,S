Just FYI - all my boxes with PS/2 connector without connected mouse (and 
psaux compiled into kernel) stop responding to keyboard as soon as gpm 
starts. If I kill gpm, keyboard starts working again. I never investigated 
it, as I assumed that it is just admin mistake to run gpm without mouse. 
It should not behave this way?
