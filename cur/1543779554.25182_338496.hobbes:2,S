That's what I felt too but wasn't sure about the power saving. However what 
you say makes complete sense; if the machine is loaded then the extra power 
overhead of 1000 vs 100 ticks is meaningless, but throughput may be of 
concern. However I managed to get it booted on my p4 at home and while I'm 
using it under load I find it rarely gets to 1000Hz during realistic loads. 
I'll be posting a fresh patch shortly with the last few cleanups I could 
find, that I'm now running on 2.6.13-rc5.
Cheers,
Con
