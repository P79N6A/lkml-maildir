According to the PC 2001 specs (Intel + Microsoft), APIC will be required
for all PC 2001 compliant computers, and all EasyPC computers should contain
an APIC.
[but I'm quoting from an early draft of the specification, 0.3]
"3.1.3 APIC support, is present, is clocked and wired.
All Desktop systems are required to have APIC implemented and properly
connected [...]"
In another paragraph, they write "an APIC compliant APIC" must be installed.
It seems that non-APIC compliant APICs are very common ;)
What would be the overhead of an APIC enabled UP kernel compared with
a non-APIC kernel [running on a non-apic computer]?
