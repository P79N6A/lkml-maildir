Now actually take a look at this diff :)  The biggest part is that the
s390 compat files exist only on s390x and the math-emu dir only exists
on s390, that's just a matter of conditionally compiling the files.
Then there's of course slightly different assembly, this is just different
but can be abstracted out nicely.  In C code there's lots of spurious
differences that don't make any sense (like using the proper type on s390x
but soething that doesn't matter on s390, commenting changes, etc..).
There's still some real differences of course, but it's really a small
amount of the code size.
