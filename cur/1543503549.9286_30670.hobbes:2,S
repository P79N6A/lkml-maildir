apc backups pro 280 is about the cheapest ups that you'll be able to
control via serial for about $USD 170-180. provided your computer draws
less than 180watts it ought to run for about 10 minutes.
check out:
http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/ups/
for all the software for upses in on linux.
I use smartups  620 which provides about 2.5x the runtime at the same
load our about 400watts for 10 minutes it only costs $USD 100 more or so.
