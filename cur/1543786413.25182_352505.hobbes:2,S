grump.  `mode' is a terrible identifier name.  Better to call it something
which identifies its meaning if true, such as `do_mapping_zapping' or
something.
Even better, implement two nicely-named functions rather than passing in a
`mode' argument.  Those functions can of course share a common
mode-selected implementation internally.
And that comment is incomprehensible, partly due to all its typos.  Care to
try again?
