And a further follow-up...
Looking in the debian bug system reveals these two bugs:
     * #216658: getty: opens tty without checking if something else is there,
       killing keyboard input
     * #226443: util-linux: [getty] Logout is really long with kernel 2.6
The first one is of particular note, because it is the cause of the GROSS
hack in agetty, which according to the comments is also in gdm.
I wonder really if the problem was elsewhere, and if Debian wanted to
take care of this problem, why they didn't just take the serial line
locking solution (really: s/serial line/tty/) and apply it to
agetty / gdm.
