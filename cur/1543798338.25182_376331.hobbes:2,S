I hate to do this, but I ended up merging some more that changes user
experience.  Two notable non-fixes are:
 - big usage string cleanups (Fredrik).
 - git-am enhancements that made a lot of sense for non mbox
   users (HPA).
So git is still in perpetual state of 1.0rc X-<.
No more big changes from now on will be merged to the "master"
branch, except fixes and documentation enhancements.
Well, patches are always welcome, but non-fixes will have to
stay in the proposed updates branch until Wednesday 2005-12-21,
which is the date I am aiming the final 1.0 for.
Right now, I have two somewhat debatable patch in the proposed
updates branch:
 - when merging a branch that renames A->B and another branch
   that renames A->C, merge-recursive leaves B and C in stage 2
   and stage 3, instead of registering them at stage 0 as the
   current "master" branch does.
 - diff gets --abbrev option to shorten the blob object names in
   diff-raw and commit object names in diff-tree headers.
These will *not* be in 1.0 final, unless somebody really wants
them and jumps up-and-down.
I personally feel the "renaming merge" desirable if it works
correctly, but (1) it is a rare case anyway, (2) I have not
tested it extensively, and (3) having hacked it myself, I do not
think I will be able to spot bugs that involve cases I have not
thought about.  So maybe a good test script and an Ack or two
could push me into moving it forward but otherwise it is slated
post 1.0.
The "diff --abbrev" addition is lower impact and I find it
somewhat cute and especially useful while working on an
80-column terminal, but I'd like to make it find unambiguous
prefix, which it does not do currently, before pushing it out.
I am also holding off another one that changes things to use
textual symref for .git/HEAD everywhere, but I think it is well
known that that change is eventually coming sometime after 1.0.
