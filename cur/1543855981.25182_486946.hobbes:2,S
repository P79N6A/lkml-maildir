Its not the final intention to keep this dinode_host structure (or
indeed the other _host structures introduced by Al's patches), its a
means to an end. Later patches in my inode shrinking series remove a
number of the fields from it, so it is much smaller. I do want to do
what you are requesting eventually, but I'm working on it a stage at a
time now that Al has pushed me in the right direction,
Steve.
