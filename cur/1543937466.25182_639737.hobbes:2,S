That isn't what Dave said above; he said that lockdep produces a single
warning at bootup.  If he did mention anything about one place being
fixed up or lockdep being pleased, it was a while back and I've lost 
track of it.
If I recall correctly the nature of the warning was that a method
routine for one class (called with the class's mutex held) was creating
a second class and locking that class's mutex.  In principle this is
perfectly legal and should be allowed for arbitrary depths of nesting,
even though it is the sort of thing lockdep is currently unable to
handle.

It's not a matter of trust or of false warnings.  People shouldn't 
tolerate any lockdep warnings at all; otherwise they will start to 
ignore the valid ones.

P.S.: Just because Greg says the code is okay doesn't mean it will 
please lockdep -- it doesn't even mean the code really is okay!  I've 
known Greg to make an occasional mistake.
