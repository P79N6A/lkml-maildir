Hello,
as I had problem with xawtv (Segmentation fault) (2.35-2.38) I have
looked for another programm for watching TV: I found kwintv (0.6.14).
Under 2.2.3-ac1, I got:
 Warning: v4l1: unable to allocate memory for snap shots and video clips!
That prevent me making snap shots...
So I have tested under 2.2.3: that's working (I have not tested xawtv under
2.2.3).
But I have look in the patch, and haven't found any change for bttv...
Thanks,
	Greg
