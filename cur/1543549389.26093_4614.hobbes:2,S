Subject: Mounting an cdrom using ide-scsi give wrong major or minor message

I am stumped on this one. I recently installed Mandrake 7.1 on a new drive and
then installed a 2.4.0-test8 kernel. When I boot using the stock kernel
(2.2.15) I can mount my CD-Burner on /dev/scd0. But when I boot to 2.4.0-test8,
mount complains that /dev/scd0 has the wrong major or minor number. I am sure
the correct modules are loading (ide-scsi, sg, and scsi_mod.o). 
cat /proc/scsi gives:
Attached devices: 
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: YAMAHA   Model: CRW8824E	   Rev: 1.00
  Type:   CD-ROM			   ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
  Vendor: NEC	   Model: CD-ROM DRIVE:252 Rev: 3.18
  Type:   CD-ROM			   ANSI SCSI revision: 02
The funny thing is, I could have sworn this worked on my old drive using a
hacked version of Mandrake 6.0 and 2.0.0-test8. Unfortunately my old drive died
so I cannot go back and verify this. Any pointers or ideas would be
appreciated.
