Wasnot it called System Call Auditing and/or Filesystem hooks?

One or the other was present in SUSE's 2.4.20/.21 kernels and one is in 2.6.x
-- and from what I have seen, they're just hooks, i.e.
if(hook != NULL) { hook(fd, buf, size); }
That's the most efficient thing you can have (in a function). It's only a
question whether it is in the right function, then.
