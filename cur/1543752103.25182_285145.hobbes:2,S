Ahh, yes. That's required on pretty much all platforms except x86 and
x86-64.
Of course, since ARM and MIPS already do the "u_int" thing, and not a 
whole lot of other architectures do PCMCIA, I guess it doesn't matter 
_that_ much. Cardbus stuff should get it right regardless.

I don't think ioaddr_t needs to match resources. None of the IO accessor
functions take "u64"s anyway - and aren't likely to do so in the future
either - so "unsigned long" should be good enough.
Having u64 for resource handling is mainly an issue for RAM and
memory-mapped IO (right now the 32-bit limit means that we throw away
information about stuff above the 4GB mark from the e820 interfaces on
x86, for example - that _happens_ to work because we never see anything 
but RAM there anyway, but it means that /proc/iomem doesn't show all of 
the system RAM, and it does mean that our resource management doesn't 
actually handle 64-bit addresses correctly. 
See drivers/pci/probe.c for the result:
	"PCI: Unable to handle 64-bit address for device xxxx"
(and I do not actually think this has _ever_ happened in real life, which 
makes me suspect that Windows doesn't handle them either - but it 
inevitably will happen some day).
