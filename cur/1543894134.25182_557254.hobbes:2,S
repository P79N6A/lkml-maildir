I know, that most developers here are not working/familiar with what
Debian has as its bug shooting weapon ``The system is mainly controlled
by  e-mail, but the bug reports can be viewed using the WWW.''[0].
I thought somebody, who familiar with that, might propose to setup/tune
it, but not doing yet another NIH thing, especially from e-mail
integration POV. I doubt mozilla guys can think about it without
javascript and/or java servlets :)
