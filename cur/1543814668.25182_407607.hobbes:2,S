kmalloc may be backed by a "struct page", but the point is that it does 
not honor the page _count_, and as such it is totally unsuitable for any 
VM usage.
The VM relies on the page count very fundamentally, so by doing a 
"get_page()" you'll tell every other user that you have a reference to a 
page, and it won't be free'd until all references are gone. In contrast, 
if you do a "get_page()" on something that has been allocated with 
kmalloc(), the slab code will totally ignore it, and happily re-allocate 
it to something else once the _original_ allocator free's it.
So kmalloc() really isn't appropriate.
