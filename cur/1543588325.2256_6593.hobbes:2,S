Why should we support such a non-spec device?  Tell ATI to fix their
hardware, and tell users (a) not to use the hardware, or (b) use the
hardware with the knowledge that you are screwed when it comes to Power
Management.
Unless there are more cases like this, this should not factor at all
into the modifications to the PCI and PM code...
