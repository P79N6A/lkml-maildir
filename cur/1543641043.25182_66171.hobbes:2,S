I'm guessing Daniel is referring to NetApp/WAFL issues.  NetApp's WAFL
filesystem (IIRC) implements something which is kinda sorta if-you-squint-
your-eyes philosophically similar to tux2's phase tree.  Only
a) It isn't *really* all that similar
b) Daniel has prior art going back to the 1980's
c) NetApp has more lawyers on staff than Daniel does
Daniel, did I get it vaguely right?
