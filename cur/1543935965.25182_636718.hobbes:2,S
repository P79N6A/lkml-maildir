Okay, then, it's less likely a regression and more likely a newly
developed hardware problem.

I've never seen ICHs or any other SATA controllers act that way.

You do that using LABEL, UUID or device ID.  Just run 'ls -l
/dev/disk/by-*/' and see the result.

Unfortunately not but you can boot into single mode where there's
nothing trying to access the disk without your explicit command and
verify access to each hard disk.
Hmm... You are seeing timeouts from multiple harddisks.  The first thing
I would try is to reseat the cables and connect the SATA hard drives to
a separate power supply and see whether that changes anything.
