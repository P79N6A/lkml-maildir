As long as there is some entropy in it, it increases the entropy in the pool.
The question is what the estimate you use for the input entropy does to
/dev/random's estimate of the total entropy in the pool.
If the input estimate is <= the actual input entropy, all is well. The overall
estimate stays <= the actual pool entropy and /dev/random works as designed.
If your estimate is high, though, it makes /dev/random think it has more
entropy than it actually does and therefore become (at least theoretically)
somewhat insecure. This is like "slightly dead", not a state you want to get
into, so (as for any other source) you must use a conservative estimate of
the RNG's entropy contribution.
The input estimate in bits per byte of RNG output should obviously be in
the range:
           0 < x < 8
since x = 0 ignores the RNG's contribution entirley and x = 8 trusts it
completely, neither of which we want to do.
Does anyone have a reasonable argument that narrows this range down?
I'd pick 6, that being the largest number I feel comfortable with, but
this is pure guesswork. I'd like to see analysis, whether it supports
or destroys that guess.
