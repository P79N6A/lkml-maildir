But it'll already be turned on if pci_assign_unassigned_resources() is
called.  This calls pdev_enable_device for every single device, which
turns on the bus master bit in the PCI command register.
Is it intentional that pci_assign_unassigned_resources should:
1. enable all devices?
2. enable bus master on all devices?
