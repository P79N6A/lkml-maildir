1.5Kb... that's quite a lot on 8Kb

There are none. And if there are they are very easy to find and fix.

LKCD is not part of the normal kernel, and in some parts could fall under
"VER VERY sick"; esp if they indeed use 6Kb stack.

Apparently you see stackoverflows with some code. Well, 1.5Kb (approx)
is some win there (although most of that is reserved for stack coloring).
If you need even more in your code (I assume you do otherwise you wouldn't
have done the work) then I really suggest you take a long hard look and fix
the obvious bugs or the design....
