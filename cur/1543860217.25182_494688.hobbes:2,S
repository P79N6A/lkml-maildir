I can give you some hints but it will involve writing a program. It can
all be done in userspace though, saving any pain of messing with the
kernel internally/kernel recompiling.
The kernel has a driver called uinput which lets you inject input events
into the kernel from a userspace piece of code. You can write a program
to read data from /dev/ttyS0 (at 9600bps) and pass it to this uinput
driver. That should then do exactly what you need.
Working out for to use uinput caused me a few headaches but I can point
you at some example code:
http://svn.o-hand.com/view/misc/trunk/zaurusd/apps/tskeys/tskeys.c?rev=59&view=markup
This code adds support for offscreen soft "buttons" on a touchscreen. It
passes the key events to the kernel via uinput.
Cheers,
Richard
