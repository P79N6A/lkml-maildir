We might call this thread "the neverending misunderstanding" ;-)
My message was a proposal about an universal solution for
control/out-of-band streams on pseudo-files (like the Linus sig fd,
devices fd, socket, proc files, etc.) as a way to comunicate between
user space and kernel space.
I.e. something that might replace ioctl/fcntl mess giving same (and
more) flexybility and power (extending the 'everything is a file'
concept also to control data).
This is *not* something I'd propose for user space (where we definitely
have many good ways to achieve these results).
