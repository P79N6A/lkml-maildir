I bet it is. In a big way.
The lock does two independent things:
 - it tells the core that it can't just crack up the load and store.
 - it also tells other memory ops that they can't re-order around it.
Neither of these have anything to do with the L1 cache.
In short, I'd be very very surprised if you didn't need a "lock" prefix
even between hyperthreaded cores. It might be true in some specific
implementation of HT, but quite frankly I'd doubt it, and I'd be willing
to guarantee that Intel would never make that architectural even if it was
true today (ie it would then break on future versions).
It should be easy enough to test in user space.

Done. Check this program out with and without the "lock ;" prefix. With
the "lock" it will run forever on a HT CPU. Without the lock, it will show
errors pretty much immediately when the two threads start accessing "nr"
concurrently.
