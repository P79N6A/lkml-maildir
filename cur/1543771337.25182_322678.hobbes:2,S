I just tried pluging in my usb2 flash reader which ought to d the same
thing to usb-storage as pluging in the external usb2 hd.
Reading from a 120G SATA WD drive gets about 41MB/s without the USB2
drive connected and about the same with.  That is on an nforce2
motherboard with it's builtin usb controller and using 2.6.10.
Trying on an Athlon64 with a 250G SATA WD drive and the same usb flash
reader, I get 57MB/s both with and without the usb2 drive connected.
That one uses a VIA K8T800 chipset and also 2.6.10.
I wonder what is different with your hardware/software mix.
I tried unloading everything to do with usb to try and see if I could
make it get a higher speed with hdparm, but no change no matter what.
