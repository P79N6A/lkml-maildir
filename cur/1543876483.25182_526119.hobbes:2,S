Subject: [patch 06/17] Allocate a fixmap slot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Allocate a fixmap slot for use by a paravirt_ops implementation.  This
is intended for early-boot bootstrap mappings.  Once the zones and
allocator have been set up, it would be better to use get_vm_area() to
allocate some virtual space.
Xen uses this to map the hypervisor's shared info page, which doesn't
have a pseudo-physical page number, and therefore can't be mapped
ordinarily.  It is needed early because it contains the vcpu state,
including the interrupt mask.
