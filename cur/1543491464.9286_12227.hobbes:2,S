Well I have to admit that playing with MikeG's code today I am been
convinced that __volatile__ is sure better even it wasn't a bug in the
current kernel ;).

No. They are serializing only _reads_ in memory (writes are ordered by
default).
Here a cut-and-paste of an Intel spec:
· Reads may not pass serializing instructions like CPUID
· Reads may not pass I/O instructions
· Reads may not pass locked instructions like XCHG
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While instead:
· Instruction fetch may pass reads
· Reads may not pass instruction fetch
· Instruction fetch may pass I/O
· Instruction fetch may pass locked operations like XCHG
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
· Instruction fetch may not pass serializing instructions
			^^^	 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
