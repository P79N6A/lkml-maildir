While we're on the "Why didn't you send the patches to the right place?" topic..
The Kernel Janitors are often referenced, but there's not much of a pointer
to them in the source tree.
% cd /usr/src/linux-2.5.69
% grep -ri janitor .
./fs/affs/Changes:- sizeof changes from Kernel Janitor Project
./include/asm-sparc/elf.h:} while(0); /* Janitors: Don't touch this colon. */
./CREDITS:D: Various Janitor work.
./CREDITS:D: petty kernel janitor (byteorder, ufs)
The lines in CREDITS reference Dave Jones and Francois-Rene Rideau.
I'm not sure if MAINTAINERS is the right place for a blurb for them,
or if it should be elsewhere.  Any opinions?
