For the record, OpenVZ uses "create with predefined ID" method which
leads to less code. For example, change at the end is all we want from
ipc/util.c .
Also, if ids were A and B at the moment of checkpoint, and during
restart they became B and A you'll get collision in both ways which you
techically can avoid by classic "tmp = A, A = B, B = tmp" but you also
can avoid all other loops just by creating with ID you need.
