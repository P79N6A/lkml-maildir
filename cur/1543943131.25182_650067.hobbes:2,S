Yes, I wrote that, and if you look at that chapter, it states it is
based on the GPL licensed documentation that comes from the kernel
itself, which was written by a lot of other people as well.

There is no such license on that documentation.

Where did I ever declare these interfaces as "free to use in violation
of the GPL" anywhere?  If you look at the examples that I wrote for that
book, they are all licensed under the GPLv2 only.
Same goes for the Windows Driver book.  You can use the Windows driver
development kit and API, as long as you follow their license.  And that
license explicitly forbids using it in code that is under an open source
license.  Is describing those interfaces in a book somehow also
"immoral"?
geesh, this thread is just insane, time to just ignore it...
