True, but it is one long division overall, not one per digit.
I just thought of a better algorithm.
  (a) Find nr. digits, i.e. smallest N s.t. base^(N+1) > number.
      Let k = base^N.  Can use a constant here if preferred.
  (b) Do N times:
          1. Subtract k repeatedly from number: count = digit.
             (Or use a faster method for a constant base, such as
             successive approximation).
          2. Multiply number by base.
It's better than the one I proposed before (and the one Linus outlined):
no table is required, no divisions, just multiplication by the base.
But this is getting silly :-)
