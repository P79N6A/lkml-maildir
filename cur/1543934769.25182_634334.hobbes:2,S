I recently put 4 GB of memory in my Acer Travelmate 8210 series
notebook.  The BIOS only detects 3 GB.
I googled around a little.  It appears to be a chipset limitation of the
945gt, which uses the fourth gig for devices.
Now I can understand this explanation for 32-bit mode, but I'm running
in 64-bit mode.  There should be a way to use the fourth gig under
Linux.  Is there?
Has anyone else solved this problem?  What happens if you just use the
mem= option to tell the kernel you have 4 GB?  I'd just try it but I
don't want to corrupt my buffer cache and get crap writte over my data
on disk.
Any advice?
