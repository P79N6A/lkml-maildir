Glad you two asked!  :)
I -do- want to use iomap.  The problem is that no one has yet come up 
with a few that does all the proper resource reservation.  Everybody 
(including myself) did the ioread/iowrite part, but gave up before 
handling all cases of (a) legacy ISA iomap, (b) native PCI IDE iomap, 
and (c) non-standard MMIO iomap.
This "works, but leaks resources" code exists in the 'iomap' branch of
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git
It languished in this incomplete stage for a while, but very recently 
got moving again:

I actually made a promise to use iomap, since libata will benefit quite 
a bit from ioread/iowrite usage.  I intend to keep that promise... it's 
just taking me a while to get us there.  Now that I figured out the path 
I want to take, we should get there around 2.6.1[56].
