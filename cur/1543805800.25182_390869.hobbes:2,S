Hey Andy, Sorry for the slow reply.
The timekeeping rework is not going to go into 2.6.16 and is currently
out of -mm until I can resolve a few laptop issues.

I'd def try to push a fix in for the issue. I'll just merge my code
around the fix.

This sounds very similar to bugme bug #5366
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5366
There's a test patch in there that maybe you could try?
thanks
