Hi, Guys:
  I am a new comer to this email list and presumably I should shut up for
a while. But this is really a traffic email-list and I got about 100
emails everyday, which stuffed my mailbox and made it very hard for me
to read other kinds of emails--emails from friends, department activities,
etc.
  I have a little suggestion as to the email subject line being sent out
by the email list server program. Can we add something like [LK] in front
of every email subject line? LK stands for Linux Kernel. I was in several
other email list before which has high traffic too. They did something
like this and it was very neat.
  This amount of traffic almost scared the hell out of me and it
surely stoped some people from joining us. So hope my suggestions can be
adopted.
with regards to all your hard working developers,
Fei
