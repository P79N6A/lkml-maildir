Not that it matters, but I don't think you need to OR in the current cpuset
cpus to the parents cpus (pspan) here, because they are already in pspan.
Look at the surrounding code:
        pspan = par->cpus_allowed;
        list_for_each_entry(c, &par->children, sibling) {
                if (is_cpu_exclusive(c))
                        cpus_andnot(pspan, pspan, c->cpus_allowed);
        }
        if (!is_cpu_exclusive(cur)) {
		cpus_or(pspan, pspan, cur->cpus_allowed);
                if (cpus_equal(pspan, cur->cpus_allowed))
                        return;
                cspan = CPU_MASK_NONE;
'pspan' starts out with all the parents cpus, which must be a superset
of currents cpus (cur->cpus_allowed.)
Then we subtract (cpus_andnot) from pspan the cpus in the cpu_exclusive
siblings of current.  Since current is not cpu_exclusive, and since the
cpus of its cpu_exclusive sibling cpusets cannot overlap with currents
cpus, we could not have subtracted any current cpu from pspan.
So pspan is still a superset of currents cpus.
So OR'ing in currents cpus to pspan is a no-op.
