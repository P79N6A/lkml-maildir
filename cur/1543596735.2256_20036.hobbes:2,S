... Bingo.  You hit the infamous __wait_on_buffer / ___wait_on_page
bug. I've seen this for quite a while now on our quad xeon test
machine, with some kernel versions it can be reproduced in minutes,
with others it won't trigger at all.
And after a recompile it's usually gone ...
I hope there is somebody out there who can RELIABLY trigger
this bug, so we have a chance of tracking it down.
