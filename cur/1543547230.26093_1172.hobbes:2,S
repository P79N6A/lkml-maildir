That would be a serious error. Often /boot is a special partition
located within the first 500 MB of the disk. Once I had it being
a link to /dos/linux, which as you may guess was a FAT filesystem.
BTW, /boot/System.map-`uname -r` is the first place in which
procps looks for the the System.map data. Red Hat and Debian
both seem to prefer this location, aside from some /System.map
braindamage that Debian sometimes uses.
