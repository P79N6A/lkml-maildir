Here are the two revised patches based on Alan Cox's NAK's and suggestions
regarding using the _pic and _pit versions of inb/outb.  The new patches
use udelay(2) as a conservative delay for pic and pit, and isolate
that usage in the respective i8253.c and i8259_*.c files.
Together with the already ack'ed patch for CMOS rtc (not included here)
these should solve the problem with modern machines, the ones that don't use
older devices, but only motherboard/chipset resources.
