For that matter, he could use a database file.  I don't know if Postgres (for 
example) supports streaming read/write from a database record, but if it 
doesn't it could be made to.
Or if he doesn't want to hack Postgres today, he can put his "metadata" in a 
database file and the video data in a separate file.
