I'm using a Red Hat 6.1 source rpm rebuild of knfsd-1.4.7 on a Red Hat 6.0
system with nfsv3 patches applied and I'm getting Invalid Argument
lockdsvc with trying to start rpc.lockd.  This of course doesn't happen on
a Red Hat 6.1 install, so what is different and how can I get it working
in Rh 6.0?
Thanks
