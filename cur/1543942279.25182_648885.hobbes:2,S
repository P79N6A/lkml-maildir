I see, thanks for pointing that out. Is there another way do you think?
Would the penalty be to high to enable vm_stat_account when
CONFIG_PROC_FS is not defined?
Or perhaps my patch would only have an effect when CONFIG_PROC_FS is set
(which is default)?

I have done a quick test a while back when I first wrote the patch. I
will test more thoroughly now.

RSS makes more sense to me as well.
To me, it makes no sense to count shared memory, because killing a
process doesn't free the shared memory.
