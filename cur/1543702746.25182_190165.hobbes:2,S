I respectfully disagree.  It is not possible to error out of the set_par()
function - for instance, fb_set_var() contains this code:
                        if (info->fbops->fb_set_par)
                                info->fbops->fb_set_par(info);
There isn't any error return checking (so why does fb_set_par return an
int when it isn't used?  It's fairly misleading.)
This all means that if the allocation of the pseudo_palette in set_par
fails, there's no way to abort the mode change - you _will_ oops in the
other fbcon layers due to a NULL pseudo_palette pointer.
Plus, we're only talking about an array of 16 32-bit words or 64 bytes.
That's hardly worth the extra code complexity to separately dynamically
allocate.
