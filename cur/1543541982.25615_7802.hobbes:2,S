Just a follow-up (reposted since vger.rutgers.edu ate its disk)
The problems with the disk drive recurred five times over two days and
then stopped. 
It hasn't happened again for the last six days.
I guess I'll write it off as caused by recent sun-spot activity.
It does seem that all the problems I've had in the past (random OOPs
etc)are related to sun spot activity - I will be getting a list of
recent sunspot activities and see if there's a correlation with my
problems.
Should I build a faraday cage?
Cheers,
Alex.
