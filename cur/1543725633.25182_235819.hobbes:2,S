One idea might be to fork off "stable" 2.6.x.y (2.6.15.1 for example)
branches every now and them. Analogous to vendor kernels, but maintained by
someone@kernel.org. Compared to the 2.6.x.0 in question, these would only
get security fixes and important bug fixes. The maintainer would need to
pick a suitable (stable) 2.6.x.0 as basis every once in an appropriate
while.
I don't know if that's feasible. Just an idea.
Anyway, as (one kind of) end user, I do welcome the new development model.
I'll get the newest features in manageable manner, and if I don't fancy that
I can resort to vendor (Fedora) kernels.
