25 parameters?  If you tell me which drugs were involved in this code,
I know what to stay away from.  Might be the current record for any
code ever proposed for inclusion.
The whole patch is full of parameter-happy functions with this one
being the ugly top of the iceberg.  I sincerely hope this is not a
defined ABI and can still be changed.
