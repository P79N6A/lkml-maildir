Some of us don't have a digital camera for taking a picture (and
besides, being able to take a picture doesn't fix the problem of oops
output scrolling out of the visible screen area).
Some of us also don't have a second PC on which to capture logs via
netconsole or serial console.
Copying oopses down by hand from screen to paper sure is a pain (I
know, I've had to do it quite a few times), but for some it's the only
option and then we generally want as much info as possible on-screen
to copy down.
And btw, multi-column oops output has recently become an option for
i386 as well - in my oppinion a good thing.
