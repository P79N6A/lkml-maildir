Wouldn't it be sufficient to include the following patch of code
at the beginning of __combi_wait(...):
        if (smp_processor_id() != owner->cpu) {
                int cnt=MAX_LOOP_CNT;
retry:
                spin_unlock(&x->wait.lock) 
                do {
                        barrier();
                while (--cnt && x->owner);
                spin_lock(&x->wait.lock);
                if (!x->owner)
                        return;
                if (cnt)
                        goto retry;
        }
       then the sleep code of __combi_wait(...)
If one fears that the owner (or current if the kernel is made
preemptible) migrated to the same cpu while we are spinning 
for x->owner and hence may
make no progress, one could let the waiting loop last about a typical
process switch time and add an outer loop that checks if the cpu
of the owner is still different.
