After thinking about it for a while (and careful reading of your
explanation) I must conclude that your view is probably safer, i.e. in
the long term it is probably better for the Linux kernel to protect its
status along the lines you described, even if it is not as "smooth" or
"convenient to everyone" as the scheme I was talking about.
On the issue of what should be considered a derivative and what shouldn't,
from your email it seems (and it's not a bad thing, imho) that the Linux
kernel is protecting itself to make sure that "interesting" functionality
is either already in the kernel or exists as a GPL'd module.
To make this thought clearer, let's say that there is no GPL'd journalling
filesystem for Linux (i.e. reiserfs, ext3 and others suddenly
disappeared). Then, to make your thoughts consistent you would need to
disable the exported interfaces required for development of a journalling
filesystem. Because, otherwise, you would be working on a "lite" OS and
"interesting stuff will happen behind the closed doors". As I said, it is
not necesserily "bad", i.e. it may well be necessary for Linux's survival
and therefore I am all for it. I only thought that there is something
_technically_ unpleasant or "wrong" about it... Maybe "wrong" is the wrong
word, but you know what I mean.
