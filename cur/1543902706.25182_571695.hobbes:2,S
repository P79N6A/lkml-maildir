Okay, I need to ask a stupid question - did you verify that it's not
spinning on a spinlock?
Specifically, I'm wondering whether the net_rx_action softirq may
be scheduled while we're in poll_napi holding the poll_lock.
net_rx_action would try to take the poll_lock as well, and we'd
be hung for good. The patch with local_bh_disable/enable was
supposed to test that idea (this is the "trickle" patch)
