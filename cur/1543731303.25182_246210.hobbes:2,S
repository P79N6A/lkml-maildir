If you ask real users, they say that reiser4 is fast, and their 
experience matches our benchmark.  You can criticize the benchmark if 
you want, but then you should run your own and publish it.
There are still plenty of things needing fixing though, and you are 
right that they are more important than the pretext being attempted for 
keeping us out of the kernel.  Probably you could supply them with many 
superior pretexts.;-)
The 90 second stalls, those should be fixed by debugging copy on capture 
and turning it on, yes?  You can hardly claim I failed to push for the 
completion of copy on capture....  and of course the reason it is not 
done is simply that there is too much to do....  I (sincerely) hope vs 
enjoys his vacation, the whole team is working too hard.  I am doing 7 
day weeks now to try to make payroll for us and keep darpa happy at the 
same time.
fsync performance needs fixing badly, and Chris is right in his 
diagnosis of what we can do to fix it.
