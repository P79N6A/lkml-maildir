BAD thing. Breaks IDE as modules (ide-mod and ide-disk used to
be autoloaded here during boot-time fsck). Also loadkeys
seems to segfault. Pre8 is OK. Setup:
Linux melchior 2.2.0-pre8 #5 SMP mar jan 19 21:39:58 MET 1999 i586 unknown
Kernel modules         2.1.85
Gnu C                  egcs-2.91.60
Binutils               980114
Linux C Library        2.0.110
Dynamic linker         ldd (GNU libc) 2.0.110
Linux C++ Library      2.8.0
Linux C++ Library      2.8.0
Procps                 1.2.4
Mount                  2.7e
Net-tools              (1998-12-05)
Kbd                    0.94
Sh-utils               1.16
Compared ltrace & strace of loadkeys for pre8 and pre9, and full .config
are available on request.

Well, does "-final fails to boot" qualify?

I do care for my IDE drive. And my keyboard layout. :)
