I was using PA2013, and was having problems with IDE too.
The data corruption was solved after turning off "Spread spectrum
modulated" feature in the BIOS setup (AFAIR this misfeature is ON
by default). But I wasn't able to get on-board IDE working right
nevertheless. For some strange reason it was OK with kernel 2.2.15
but produced DMA timeouts with every later kernel version I tested.
Yes, I did try copying VIA IDE driver from 2.2.15 to later kernel,
it still didn't help. So I ended up with Promise controller too :(
