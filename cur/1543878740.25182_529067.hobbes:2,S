AFAICS, ACPI supplies the envelope which delivers the table,
and ACPI has some convenience structure definitions for that
table in include/acpi/actbl1.h (primarily for the acpixtract table dis-assembler),
but ACPI is otherwise not involved in IOMMU support.
Indeed, one might argue that all new functions in this patch series with
"acpi..." would more appropriately be called "pci...", since a cursory
scan of the IOMMU spec seems to suggest it is specific to PCI.
So on first blush, it looks like the only call to a function that begins with
"acpi" in this patch series should be acpi_get_table() from some IOMMU
specific file outside of drivers/acpi,
and the only modification to any code with an "acpi" in the file path or filename should
be any updates to the convenience structure definitions in acpitbl1.h
thanks,
