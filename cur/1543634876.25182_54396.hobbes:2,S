Sorry about the "shotgun" targeted bug report....
I've recently bought an HP zt1130 Pavilion Laptop.  I first installed store 
bought RedHat 7.2, and did not have sound nor power management.  I hacked a 
little, but saw RedHat 7.3 out (v.2.4.18), and did a clean install via their 
iso files.
All the same, no sound, no power management. So I looked further, reading off 
the VIA Tech  website. (
http://www.via.com.tw/en/ProSavage
 
Chipsets/prosav_index.jsp)  On that site, I see that my laptop (dmesg) 
configd the PM133 but the chipset seems to be their PL133T instead.  So at 
this point it seems a mis-identified chipset ID bug.
Thanks,
David Weeks
