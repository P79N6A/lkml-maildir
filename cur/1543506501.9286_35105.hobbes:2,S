  Hi,
I've just tried to apply the .15-pre1 patch, in order to solve my
'free free IRQ' problem, but it fails to compile with the matrox frame buffer
compiled in the core kernel (not in a module)
gcc 2.7.2.3 complains:
matroxfb.c: In function `initMatrox2':
matroxfb.c:5878: section attribute cannot be specified for local variables
this is the faulty line:
   static struct fb_videomode defaultmode __initdata = {
     /* 640x480 @ 60Hz, 31.5 kHz */
     NULL, 60, 640, 480, 39721, 40, 24, 32, 11, 96, 2,
     0, FB_VMODE_NONINTERLACED
   };
  It sounds like this declaration should be put outside the initMatrox2()
function, right?

If you think things can't get worse it's probably only because you
lack sufficient imagination.
