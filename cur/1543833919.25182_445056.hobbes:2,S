Er... I was assuming that was an application-level ping, e.g. "fetch
database-generated web page", and not an ICMP-level ping.
If this *is* talking about ICMP-level ping, I agree completely;
that makes no sense.  Either there is a dire bug in Linux networking,
or the networks aren't the same.  Assuming the two machines are
located together (if they're not, there's your problem right there),
is the same 20 ms visible when you ping them from each other?
