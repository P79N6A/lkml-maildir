As a long time kernel tester, I see some problem with the
newer "new development model". In the short merge windows,
after to much time, there are to many patches.
So there are problem to bisect bugs, and to have attention
of developers. My impression is that in a week there are
many more messages in lkml and to much bugs to be
handled in these few days.
I've two proposal:
- better patch quality. I would like that every commit
would compile. So an automatic commit test and public
blames could increase the quality of first commits.
[bisecting with non compilable point it is not a trivial
task]
- a slow down the patch inclusion on the merge windows
(aka: not to much big changes in the first days).
As tester I prefer that some big changes would be
included in a "secondary window" (pre o rc release),
in an other period as the big patch rush.
