But you are wrong, UTF-8 strings never contain garbage. UTF-8 is
well-defined and is always proper UTF-8. It's a tautology.
The evry idea of "UTF-8 with garbage in it" doesn't make sense.

It's also a totally useless idiom...

On ascii-only-systems, it works fine. My system is largely ascii-only,
with only very few filenames (japanese and german ones mostly) in
UTF-8. Sometimes in EUC-JP, but that's a bug in rar.
It also works fine in single-user environments where the user just forces
everything to be in her locale. It does fail miserably on multi-user
systems. It does fail miserably in ISO-C's locale model. It does fail
miserably with gnu shellutils, fileutils and most other apps.
It fails, because it's not at all well supported by the kernel.
Claiming that it largely works today is simply not true for most
non-ascii-users (which increasingly includes the US).
