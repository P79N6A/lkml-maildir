Not necessarily some large consumers, but epoll() is quite older than its
kernel inclusion, so there certainly are some apps still using the syscall
without going through libc.

I think it would be reasonable to use the NR_epoll* names first, and to
declare NR_sys_epoll* aliases which will point to NR_epoll*. You would
then add a comment with the date of the change, stating that you keep
them just in case there are some old apps. Then, someone coming on the
comment in 3 or 4 years could reasonably suggest removing those aliases.
