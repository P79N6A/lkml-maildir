Hi Brian,
(not a guru, so can only suggest ways I would approach the problem)
If you have a spare machine lying around that you can set up to be a
temporary nameserver, any one of the options below might get you closer.
The downside is that you have to be able to tolerate nameserver death
briefly, and have time to do lots and LOTS of digging.
Now, if you're still reading :) you could....
Install IKD, enable ktracer with a modest trace buffer.  Set up a serial
console on another machine and use IKD's ability to dump the trace buffer
to console for later use (SysRQ-g).  Since SysRQ is dead after panic time,
you could modify kernel/panic.c:panic() to force the trace by inserting
something like this (copied from drivers/char/sysrq.c)..
	#ifdef CONFIG_TRACE
		printk(KERN_INFO "DAL: ktrace start\n");
		ktrace_to_console();
		printk(KERN_INFO "DAL: ktrace end\n");
	#endif
..after if (panic_timeout > 0).  Boot the machine with a panic=N kernel
parameter and wait for kaboom to happen.  The tail of the trace should
show what led up to the problem.  This effectively turns a simple oops
into a megaoops with tons of kernel history (after ktrace processing).

Another way would be to modify memleak such that you can use it's wrap
method to finger the original caller trying to free this bad address.
If you're interested in this route, and don't know how, contact me
privately, and I'll make you an incremental diff to do this [1]. (it's
easy.. wrap kfree, and pass pointer to alloc_struct down the stack.
__kmem_cache_free() is the guy generating the oops in this case, so
printk IDPTR->file and IDPTR->line prior to oops. You can also examine
memleak's allocation accounting array and if the alloc_struct pointer
is still present [already freed addr might be the problem], printk where
it was originally allocated from.)
'nuther option..
Install SGI's kdb.  It pops up automagically upon oops, so you can poke
around in a hot (and busted) system before it dies.  Very spiffy IMHO.
