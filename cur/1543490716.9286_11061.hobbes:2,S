I think he has a point, though. You can hardlink even to a file with 0 perms.
Such files are immune to the open trick you mention below, but the only way to
get around the linking would be to first create a 700 directory in /tmp and
export TMPDIR=/tmp/foo. This requires trickery in your .profile to find
a suitable foo.
