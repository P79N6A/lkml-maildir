Subject: PATCH? rcu_do_batch: fix a pure theoretical memory ordering race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

On top of rcu-add-a-prefetch-in-rcu_do_batch.patch
rcu_do_batch:
	struct rcu_head *next, *list;
	while (list) {
		next = list->next;	<------ [1]
		list->func(list);
		list = next;
	}
We can't trust *list after list->func() call, that is why we load list->next
beforehand. However I suspect in theory this is not enough, suppose that
	- [1] is stalled
	- list->func() marks *list as unused in some way
	- another CPU re-uses this rcu_head and dirties it
	- [1] completes and gets a wrong result
This means we need a barrier in between. mb() looks more suitable, but I think
rmb() should suffice.
