Subject: [patch 1/6] serial: don't optimise away baud rate changes when BOTHER is used
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org>
The uart_set_termios() function will bail out early without bothering to
touch the hardware, if it decides that nothing "relevant" has changed. 
Unfortunately, its idea of "relevant" doesn't include c_[io]speed.  So if
the baud rate bits are BOTHER and you just change the speed, the change
gets optimised away.
This patch makes it ignore the old Bfoo bits in c_cflag and just check
whether c_ispeed and c_ospeed have changed.  Those integers are always set
appropriately for us by set_termios().
