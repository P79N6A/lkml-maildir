The device (or the kernel, or...) can't possibly know it is truly
erroneous.  And this _has_ to be done somehow. Only way around this would
be some kind of hardware key (setting jumpers or so). But then it isn't
"user-serviceable" anymore... same goes for "protect iopl() with ioctl()
and ..." The cracker _can_ get around it. And for dire predictions about
machines killed by next generation vira or trojans, there are still
chernobyled and melissaed motherboards somewhere around here. Destroyed,
for all practical purposes.
Blocking <whatever> inside the kernel isn't even 10% of the solution.
