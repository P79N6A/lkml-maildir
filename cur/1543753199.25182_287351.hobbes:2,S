Maybe we could use FUSE to provide read()/write() for relayfs files -
opening a FUSE relayfs file would open and mmap the actual relayfs
file, read() would move around in the buffer using basically the
current relayfs read logic moved down into the FUSE filesystem read
fileop, and write() could write directly to the buffer...
