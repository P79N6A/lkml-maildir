Well there's really no point arguing about this. We've found the cause
of the hole (good), but moving other things around to magically fix it
is the wrong thing to do.
I'll queue a patch to remove the big ugly alignment.
Automatically detecting these sorts of holes in the kernel image would
be a useful thing to do. In a couple instances, I've spotted much
larger ones.
