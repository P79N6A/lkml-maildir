This particular breakage appears to have been caused by kbuild not
automatically updating .config.  That's odd because at other times
I've seen kbuild be over-insistent that it needs to update .config.
However, now I get a different error:
  CC      arch/arm/mm/discontig.o
arch/arm/mm/discontig.c:19:3: #error Fix Me Please
arch/arm/mm/discontig.c:30: warning: excess elements in array initializer
arch/arm/mm/discontig.c:30: warning: (near initialization for `discontig_node_data')
arch/arm/mm/discontig.c:31: warning: excess elements in array initializer
arch/arm/mm/discontig.c:31: warning: (near initialization for `discontig_node_data')
arch/arm/mm/discontig.c:32: warning: excess elements in array initializer
arch/arm/mm/discontig.c:32: warning: (near initialization for `discontig_node_data')
make[2]: *** [arch/arm/mm/discontig.o] Error 1
and a .config which looks like this:
CONFIG_ARCH_SA1100=y
...
# CONFIG_ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE is not set
CONFIG_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL=y
CONFIG_FLATMEM_MANUAL=y
# CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM_MANUAL is not set
# CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_MANUAL is not set
CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM=y
CONFIG_FLATMEM=y
CONFIG_FLAT_NODE_MEM_MAP=y
CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y
At a guess, this is because we have two memory models selected - because
the Kconfig magic in mm/Kconfig isn't correct for ARM.
ARM selects CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM for certain platforms (based on
CONFIG_ARCH_SA1100 in this case.)  mm/Kconfig decides on its own back
that it'll choose CONFIG_FLATMEM for us.  So two models get selected.
Should I remove the mm/Kconfig include and replicate what's required for
ARM, or... ?  TBH mm/Kconfig seems to be rather OTT.
Help!
