dmesg says lp0 out of paper.
I don't know if the problem is related to EPP, because it is not a
regular thing. Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't. I
changed to Normal (in the BIOS) once and it worked, but I didn't
heavily tested it since vmware just didn't work with this setting, and
I got to get back to EPP. Nevertheless, it doesn't print more than 2
pages now whether in vmware or in linux. Please help me, my printer
just became unusable in linux now since I use the newest kernels.
Thanks for taking care.
