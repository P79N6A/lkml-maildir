Hallo l-k,
I have problem with my Abit AV8 MB (s939 with VIA KT800Pro chipset and
VIA sATA controller and 120GB Seagate Barracuda disk): I cannot switch
32bit access to disk to on?! I'm using libata driver...
When I use hdparm -c1 /dev/sda, I've got some error message (sorry, I
haven't this message here, it's my home computer). Therefore disk is too
slow to putting data for burning CD's and I need 'burnfree' feature...
Please, have anyone advice for me to speedup disk access, or is it
possible?
Sincerely
Jan Marek
