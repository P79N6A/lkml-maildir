So, here is the actual commit of the code in Linville's wireless
networking development tree:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-dev.git;a=commitdiff;h=fb32e1730a91e39adcf06ed5254bfc5a65d17a9b
It I am not mistaken, it was Sunday afternoon, so probably 5/6 or more
of this thread consisting of more than 110 messages (according to my
inbox) to LKML was after this time.
As this already had the BSD license ...
Anyway, as for the changes, I am not going to check the original, but
from the first commit up to now is here:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-dev.git;a=blobdiff;f=drivers/net/wireless/ath5k_hw.c;h=e4cc307e9590a71bcc8542c45dbd2caf3f9e8fe5;hp=f273c42d4004b81597e7cfc5f7eec757a7c52910;hb=everything;hpb=fb32e1730a91e39adcf06ed5254bfc5a65d17a9b
Running a diffstat shows:
 ath5k_hw.c |  344 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++--------------------------------
 1 file changed, 165 insertions(+), 179 deletions(-)
But not having the original version, and as the other two lines are
already present, I am not going to look closer at the changes.
<snip>
However, the question I wanted to ask, was this:
Can all those that still feel that there is a problem, please go and
look at the original, compare it to the current, and then determine (ie,
go ask a lawyer or some other appropriate person if need be) if the
changes is enough of a contribution *BEFORE* posting again?
Pretty please with sugar on top?
Thanks,
M
