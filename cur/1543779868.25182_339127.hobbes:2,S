Your patch looks right to me, and bless you for catching this.
But it does get into changing lots of arches, which we were
trying to avoid at this moment.  Well, that's up to Linus.
And it does miss arm, the only arch which actually needs changing
right now, if we simply restore the original values which Nick shifted
- although arm references the VM_FAULT_ codes in some places, it also
uses "> 0".  arm26 looks at first as if it needs changing too, but
a closer look shows it's remapping the faults and is okay - agreed?
I suggest for now the patch below, which does need to be applied
for the arm case, and makes applying your good cleanup less urgent.
Restore VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, VM_FAULT_MINOR and VM_FAULT_MAJOR to their
original values, so that arches which have them hardcoded will still
work before they're cleaned up.  And correct arm to use the VM_FAULT_
codes throughout, not assuming MINOR and MAJOR are the only ones > 0.
