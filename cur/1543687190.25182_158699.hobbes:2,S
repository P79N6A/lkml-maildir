Yes, this is incorrect.
Kernel developers have been telling people for years, "do not directly
include kernel headers."

Well, do you expect kernel developers to fix up every libc out there?
That's what libc maintainers exist for.  Distro guys did glibc,
(glibc-kernheaders) that covers the majority.
In any case, _this thread_ is an attempt to answer your question,
"what's the plan?"  For 2.6, I don't need include/abi happening.  Way
too late for that.  For 2.7, IMO we need it...
