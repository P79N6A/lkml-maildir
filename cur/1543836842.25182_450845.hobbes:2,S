Its not being truncated at 255 characters, its being truncated at the 
first space.  This is coming out of parse_args, which dumps '\0's into 
the command_line as it rips it apart.  We now only have one copy of the 
command line (in x86_64) instead of two, so we now expose this trashed 
copy in /proc/cmdline.
