If that's a kernel header, you have a bug.

On a Linux 2.4.xx system and above, you do this:
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
#ifndef AT_CLKTCK
#define AT_CLKTCK       17    // frequency of times()
#endif
#define NOTE_NOT_FOUND 42
//extern char** environ;  // if _GNU_SOURCE not defined
// for ELF executables, notes are pushed before environment and args
// (Portable too! This even works on PA_RISC for some reason.)
static unsigned long find_elf_note(unsigned long findme){
  unsigned long *ep = (unsigned long *)environ;
  while(*ep++);
  while(*ep){
    if(ep[0]==findme) return ep[1];
    ep+=2;
  }
  return NOTE_NOT_FOUND;
}
// ...
Hertz = find_elf_note(AT_CLKTCK);
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Don't trust any _sysconf() junk. It's broken.

Cute. It's bloat though, because it turns constant
expressions into variable ones.

That's a bug. They should be in terms of USER_HZ,
milliseconds, centiseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds.
Pick something good and make a patch.
