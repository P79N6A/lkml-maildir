   I am still working on this to make sure that it is bug free, but at
   the moment I am fairly confident to make patches available within
   about a week.
Sounds quite interesting.
Note there are some systems (Solaris) which cache the _entire_ poll
fd/event state across select/poll system calls, take a look at
/usr/include/sys/poll_impl.h on a Solaris box to see how they do it.
Their scheme is more intricate and complex than is really necessary
IMHO, but it is a good source of ideas.
Later,
