Soon but not terribly soon.  Intel has been responsive to feedback from
Andrew Morton and myself.  Once it passes our review and Intel's
testing, it will go in.  eepro100 will live on for a while, until we are
certain e100 is stable, though.  (and eepro100 won't disappear from 2.4
at all)

Things are looking hopeful on this front.  e1000 is going to be
submitted for inclusion into the kernel soon, reportedly with a GPL /
BSD + patent grant license.  e100 should follow suit.
This hasn't happened yet, so I don't want to say "yes" for sure...
