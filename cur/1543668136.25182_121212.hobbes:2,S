Hi,
Everytime I write a CDRom, I get several errors like this in my messages-file, 
but the kernel does not panic/crash/freeze:
kernel: __alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed (gfp=0x20/0)
kernel: __alloc_pages: 2-order allocation failed (gfp=0x20/0)
My Kernel version is 2.4.19-4GB (From SuSE 8.1) and I use a Ricoh RW9200 
IDE-CD writer with the ide-scsi interface and xcdroast (cdrecord). I have a 
AMD 751 (Irongate) chipset. If you need any more information, please tell me.
I want to know what this message means and if this is something to worry 
about. My written CD's seem to be o.k.
		Best Regards,
		Hermann
