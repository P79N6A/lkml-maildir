youre welcome :)
if youre hanging on to that box, remove the memory from banks 3 and 4
and it should be ok. if my memory serves me right, you cant have only 3
banks of memory (hence removing bank 3 also), the motherboard is
configured to handle 1, 2, or 4 populated banks. it you leave bank 3
in while removing bank 4, it will beep at you when you power it on and
do nothing. with a gig of ram, it should still be plenty useful.
