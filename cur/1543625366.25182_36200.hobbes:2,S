Yes.. I was reported that it some how got dropped from our 2.4 version of the driver.. 
DON'T add add_interrupt_randomness, just add "| SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM" to the call to request_irq. 
Patch to follow.

Hi,
All hooks for the random ganeration (add_blkdev_randomness() ) are ignored 
in the cpqarray / ida  driver.
	Is a patch available ?
	or an other updated driver ?
	any hints where to put add_blkdev_randomness() in your driver ?
	
	is add_interrupt_randomness() called on an i386 SMP IO-APCI system ?
Thanks
Manon
