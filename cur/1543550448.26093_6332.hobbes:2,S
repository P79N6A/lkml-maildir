If you read my entire post, rather than just the part that you quoted,
you'll see that I argue FOR, not against, a larger pid_t, based on just
these grounds; I know that sooner or later, we'll need those extra
processes. Well, my 486 won't...

Again, read the entire post, not just the part you quoted. PLEASE?
Even just the quote. "[...]JUST by having more PID's[...]". The
paragraph this stands in continues with a reasoning on how much
easier it would be to assume that someone's trying to break into your
machine when's he's doing a forkbomb and trying to eat 31 bits of
PID's rather than just 15...
Please, I'm with you on this one, not against you. I want pid_t to be
increased. I'd rather see it sooner than later. What I meant was simply
that _purely_ making the move out of security reasons might not be
reasonable.
