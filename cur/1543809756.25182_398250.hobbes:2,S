The discussion was about what size to make the swap prefetching. Since the 
size is not user tunable any more that is not the case. I had an offlist 
discussion with Bart Samwel about it and basically if your drive spins down 
at 5 seconds (which is what commonly happens with laptop mode) you will never 
have an opportunity to prefetch. This means swap prefetch will basically 
always spin up the drive nullifying laptop mode. On balance if you care about 
power more than anything to actually set laptop mode I suspect you wont want 
prefetch using any more power.
Cheers,
Con
