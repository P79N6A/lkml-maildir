This is unfair. There are unstable machines out there. Some of them
are unstable because of hardware (I remember my 486 with ne2000 would
lock sometimes; moving ne2000 around helped). Some of them are
unstable because of sw/hw combination (friend of me just asked me
about linux printing something about tx timeouts and then locking up
hard). Of course, difference is that NT will not tell you about tx
timeouts :-). Of course, difference #2 is you can debug linux if you
happen to own bad linux/hw combination.
Linux _is_ superior, but if I asked you [I don't, my sw/hw is reliable]
# Can You explain to me why I've to reboot my Linux 2.2.7 ( low charged )
# server  every 48-72 hours becouse It stop responding to every networks
# queries ?
you would not be able to answer, too, without me providing _much_ more
information.

You have sw/hw combination that works?
