Testing for the internal ranges can be done by searching a list of about
five ranges, that should be not much slower than taking an uncontended
lock, and very much faster than waiting for smbus to finish it's current
task in case the lock is contended. I'm more concerned about driver
(un)loading being slowed down by ACPI.

worst case I can imagine: IDE/graphic stalles while ACPI takes a second to
read the battery state.
