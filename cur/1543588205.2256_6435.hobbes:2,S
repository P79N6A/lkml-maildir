Putting on a driver author hat what I want is
	pci_power_on_generic
	pci_power_off_generic
	pci_power_on_null
	pci_power_off_null
At which point most driver writers are having to do no thinking at all about
their device. The PCI layer just requires they pick a function and stick it
in the struct pci_device.

This doesnt help you. You need device specific support in each case where
bus mastering is occuring and a bus master error could be fatal if missed.
For example on i2o I can easily have 4Mbytes of outstanding I/O between the
message layer and disk, all of which is bus mastering. Only the driver actually
knows when its idle.

X has hooks for this in XFree 4
