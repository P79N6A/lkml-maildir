I have both a PIT/TSC and apic. So, as Thomas told me, the ktimer code
should figure out what to use. So that's pretty much all I can say on
clocksource ;)
As for the dmesg, there isn't really one. I have my own logging code that
flagged this, as well as a check that would BUG on the system when this
happened.  So my messages may not mean much to you.  I'm currently
compiling Ingo's -rt12 (with a fix to his checking) to see if I can
trigger it there too.  My custom kernel doesn't touch the ktimer/timeofday
code so I'm assuming that I can. But until I can trigger this on a kernel
that I didn't taint, I'll stop bothering you :-)

Hmm, I believe that the ktimers use the apic (when available) and let the
jiffies still be calculated via PIT/TSC.
Thomas, is the above correct?
Would that have triggered your bug?
Thanks,
