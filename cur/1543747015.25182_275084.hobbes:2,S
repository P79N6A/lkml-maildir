I'm wondering if 2000 is really the value we want here. As far as I can 
see, the  schedule_timeout(2*HZ);  line has been there as long back as 
since HZ was 100, so back then the delay would have been 200. if 200 is 
all it needs, then we are now sleeping 10 times as long as really needed.
What is the argument behind the value used?
