FWIW, that is annoying and painful for us downstream jobbers, since it 
isn't really how git was meant to be used.  You use it more like a patch 
queue, where commits are very fluid.
Unfortunately, if there is any synchronization lag between me and you -- 
not uncommon -- then I cannot commit changes on top of the changes just 
sent, in my own local tree.  Why?  Because you rebase so often, I cannot 
even locally commit dependent patches due to the end result merge 
getting so nasty.
I understand the desire to want a nice and clean history, but the 
frequency here really has a negative impact on your downstreams.
It also totally screws the commit statistics, wiping me and John and the 
committers we have preserved out, replacing everybody's committer with 
David Miller.
