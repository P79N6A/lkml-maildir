Well, it works in its current form, and drivers should call it when
their reinit logic fails to reinitialize the device. They don't, which
is a bug, and should be fixed. I don't think removing gameport_rescan()
will help fixing them.

It is used, just not outside libps2. Does the EXPORT_SYMBOL() make the
kernel so much bigger?
