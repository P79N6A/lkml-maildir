I am found an interesting (bug?) feature in kernels between
2.6.7-mm1 and 2.6.7-mm4
Some web pages eg. 
http://www.hup.hu/
http://portal.fsn.hu/
http://wiki.hup.hu/
is unreachable with these kernels. If i try kernel versions
<= 2.6.7 everything is O.K. above-mentioned all web pages works.
I try this web pages with some different operating systems
like Windows, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, WinCe... and seems working
fine for me.
Any idea?
Thanks.
