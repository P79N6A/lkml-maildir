In principle BLKRRPART does what its name says: it rereads the
partition table.  If this changes partitions, then blocks that belong
to these partitions must be discarded. There is no reason why BLKRRPART
should discard blocks belonging to the entire disk.
The ioctl for discarding buffers is BLKFLSBUF.
