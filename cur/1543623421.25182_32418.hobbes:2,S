Sorry to be slow here, but if WCE=0, then commands aren't complete until
data is on the media, so since previous commands don't complete until
data is on the media, and they must complete before the ordered tag
command does, what you say would have to be the case.  I thought the idea
was to buffer commands to drive memory (so that the drive could increase
performance by writing back to back commands without losing a rev) and
then issue a command with a "flush" side effect.
Here is an interesting question.  If you use WCE=1 and then send an
ordered tag with FUA=1, does that imply that data from previous
write commands is flushed to media?  I don't think so, though it
would be a useful feature if it did.
