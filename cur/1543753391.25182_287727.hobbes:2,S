Hmmm... though it works on i386 SMP, it doesn't, however, seem to work on
ppc64 SMP:-/
My pSeries box seems to think that it can't find any symbols from previously
loaded modules, and my Power5 box is quite happy to load modules that depend
on other modules but panics because it can't mount its root fs.
This is very odd, because the patch is simple enough. Is there anything
obvious I've missed that you can see? Or maybe I'm just misunderstanding how
stop_machine_run() works... maybe it can't be called during initialisation.
