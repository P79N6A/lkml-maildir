Linus,
Could you please pull from:
git://git.o-hand.com/linux-rpurdie-leds for-linus
This adds a couple of new LED drivers and converts the LED class away
from struct class_device as well as some bug fixes. Most of this has
been in -mm for a while as it just missed the 2.6.22 merge window.
Thanks,
Richard (LED maintainer)
