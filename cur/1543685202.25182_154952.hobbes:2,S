Subject: any DRM update scheduled for 2.4.23-pre?

Is anyone planning to update the apparently obsolete(*)
DRM drivers currently in 2.4.22-pre/rc for 2.4.23?
I noticed that the RH9 kernel applies a drm-4.3 patch,
so the code must be there, just not in Marcelo's tree :-(
(*) XFree86-4.3.0 tells me my radeon module from 2.4.22-pre10
is out of date, and glxgears runs like molasses :-(
With 2.6.0-test2, the X server doesn't complain, and rendering
performance is an order of magnitude better.
