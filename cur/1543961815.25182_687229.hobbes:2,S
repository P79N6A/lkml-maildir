this is how it always was supposed to be!
At least this is how Intel specifies it to the BIOS vendors (but remember, it's the bios
that pretty much sets the cpu order; some will be weird).
Exactly for the maxcpus=2 reason... (and for systems where the cpu scheduler does 
load balancing "from 0 up" it also makes sense)
