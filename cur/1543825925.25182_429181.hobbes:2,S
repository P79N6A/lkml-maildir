I haven't looked at the code, but if there is just normal console
running and nothing like X is around, doesn't the console system
always have the semaphore? If it always has the semaphore then
interupt context printk's aren't blocked.
I think that interrupt context printk's work today, I have definitely
seen one printk get inserted into the middle of another on my console.
How else could you achieve that?
