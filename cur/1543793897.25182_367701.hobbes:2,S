Right now, I am not much of an improvement.

The process is dead so the mapping is not a concern. But that huge page is
gone and is no longer useful as a huge page. So, no, it cannot be used for
normal use.
What could be done is something like the following;
1. Go to the struct page that represents the start of the huge page
2. Clear all the flags and fields. Set the count to 1
3. Call __free_pages(smallpage, 0)
Do that for every struct page within the huge page except for the one that
the MCA flagged as bad. The side-effect will be that the buddy allocator
will merge them back to the largest possible blocks and place them on the
free lists. That will give you back all the small pages at least.

Not that I am aware of but that does not mean they do not exist.
