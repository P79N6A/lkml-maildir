I disagree. procfs is the most important and useful reporting system the
kernel has.

In what way is this bad? Can you have too much information available?

Remove the word "process" from "process information" (maybe replace
with kernel) and I'd agree with you. Nothing beats doing a cat
/proc/myinfo while developing a kernel driver.
Sure, if you're going to make that information part of a control loop,
you need something else.

But this is wrong ("evil").  They should't.  Parsing is easy.  Let them
parse.  Binary structures are for C.

Unfortuately for your argument, humans are the ones processing the
information, ultimately.

Untrue.  Humans always read it, directly, or pretty nearly directly.
Anyway, it is clear that you are straying into the realms of language
design, where you have little experience!

So what? Who cares. It's supposed to be convenient. If  that's what it
takes to be convenient, that's what it takes.

Well, only ps fails that I know of!

Procfs has races and security problems. They should be addressed.

That's only for the registered-my-function procfs files.  As I recall,
the code dumps the whole splurge into a buffer again and then skips to
the right spot and reads back its character.  3000-1 inefficiency, with
races.  The difficulty here is probably not this, but the fact that
the inner code doesn't know it's still talking to the same process
and doesn't need to recalculate anything. Heck, the fault is probably
yours for not buffering the output.
