so now you are saying that you are faster then a ramdisk?????
either you are completely out of touch or you misunderstood what I was 
saying.
if you have a reliable UPS and are willing to rely on it to save your data 
take the identical hardware to what you are planning to use, but instead 
of using your driver just create a ramdisk and load it on boot and save 
the contents on shutdown.
in this case you are doing zero disk I/O during normal operation, you only 
touch the disk during startup and shutdown.
with your proposal the system will be copying chunks of data from the 
ramdisk to the hard disk at random times, and you are claiming that doing 
so makes you faster then a ramdisk????
I'll say it again. if you trust your UPS and don't care about unclean 
shutdowns (say for example that you trust that linux is just never going 
to crash) there's no need to write parts of the ramdisk to the hard disk 
during normal operation, you can wait until you are told that you are 
going to shutdown to do the data save.
now there's no driver needed, just a couple lines of init scripts.
