hello kernel people.
I've got a suggestion for linux kernel on i386: what about
fastcall support (i.e. passing function parameters through
registers, not the stack and correct compiling with -mrtd
and -mregparm gcc switches)? Fastcall will surely improve
overall perfomance of kernel.
May be someone has already tried to do this?
I've browsed through the source and notices that main
drawback is some assembler code.. however it can be
easily enclosed in C functions to let compiler use specified
calling convention instead of hardcoded one..
what do you think about this? are there any drawbacks
and possible problems?
ps: I successfully compiled current kernel with -mrtd and -mregparm=x but it
doesnot work :)
Konstantin.
