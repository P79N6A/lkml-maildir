No joke.  64-bit Windows Advanced Server 2003 blue-screens on file share
access.  I was using Samba 3.0 on RH8 to routinely access windows
shares.  When I upgraded from 2.4.22 to 2.4.25, any attempt to access a
sub-directory of a share mounted from 64-bit Win2003, immediately
crashes windows.  I rolled back to 2.4.22 and no crash.  I tried 2.4.25
against a 32-bit 2003 Win2003, and no crash.  I didn't test different
versions of Samba.  But on 2.4.25, trying to ls a sub-directory of the
mounted share or cd to that sub-directory, instantly and repeatedly
blue-screens windows.  
I have no idea how the kernel change could be causing this.  Seems to me
like it should depend entirely on Samba.  I did attempt to reproduce the
problem with tcp-replay.  I sent the identical tcp/ip packets involved
without crashing windows.  Apparently share authentication is required.
My company has informed Microsoft of the problem, weeks ago, but I am
getting tired of waiting for a fix.
Congrats to everyone involved!
