long long is defined in ISO C9X, your above definition is no longer true.
C9X clearly states in 6.2.1.1:
          - The rank of long long int shall  be  greater  than  the
            rank  of long int, which shall be greater than the rank
            of int, which shall be greater than the rank  of  short
            int,  which  shall  be  greater than the rank of signed
            char.
Cheers,
    Jakub
