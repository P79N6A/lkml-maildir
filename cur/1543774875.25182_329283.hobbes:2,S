Ok.  Those things should probably be divided up.  Stuff like POSIX
extended attributes and such that have existing interfaces should use
those.  Other types of data should chose other interfaces that make
the most sense for that type of data.  I think that the /meta fs
should probably only be used when the data is generated from the
existing file or directory, and perhaps a few other cases.

I agree with the first, but I think that the implementation and usage
confusion will be one of the barriers preventing '...' or metafs merge.

Agreed.  On the other hand, perhaps filesystems that support such meta
data should internally assign the appropriate numbering to make it work
nicely.

I don't see this occurring often enough to be a major problem, and in
any case inodes are not path-exclusive (think hardlinks).  If they have
the filedescriptor open, however, they could use /proc/$PID/* to figure
out where the file is.

Yeah.  I was referring more to calling it "metafs" than "attrfs",
because it seems it would be more than just attributes.

Those would be tied to file descriptor (/meta/fd) or filesystem device
ID (/meta/fs/$DEV), and would therefore be accessible from metafs in a
similar way to how filedescriptor path info is available from procfs.

Agreed.  On another note, it's nice to see the flamewar has died out
and several technical discussions are taking place on various  
levels :-D.
