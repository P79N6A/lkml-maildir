You should note this changelog entry from Debian sid:
make-dfsg (3.80+3.81.rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * New upstream release candidate.
  * Bug fix: "Make always recompiles everything in the Linux Kernel.",
    thanks to Neil Brown. This is really a bug in the kernel build system,
    not make. However, this release defers the change so as not to trigger
    the bug.                                      (Closes: #356552, #356630).

So that the make in sid is no longer affected and (hopefully) this version will
make its way into etch soon.
