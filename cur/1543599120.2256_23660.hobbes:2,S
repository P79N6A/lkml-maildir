This probably belongs on the emu10k1 list but that was down last I tried...
One of the recent changes in the emu10k1 module causes my card to go mute.  I
can plug the speakers into the rear port(black right?) and sound will work...If
I play a dvd with xine I need to switch it to the front port(green?)...Running
emu-script mutes both ports even though in aumix everything is 75%.
The card used to work fine before the merge, but had the same problem when
using the creative cvs drivers...
The card I have is the 'value' I think so I have emu-script as so:
CARD_IS_5_1=no
USE_DIGITAL_OUTPUT=no
ENABLE_TONE_CONTROL=yes
...
MULTICHANNEL=no
Changing those settings doesn't make a difference.
