Very often.

Practically never.
Changes like that aren't worth the work you put in, *unless* those are the  
1-2% your program takes too long to meet some sort of deadline. *And* you  
have already given up on larger improvements.
In which case you need a real-time job, and Un*x nice values are  
completely irrelevant to your problem.

OTOH, "seeing" it doesn't mean it's real.
Oh, BTW, I certainly agree that a more dramatic difference between nice  
levels would be good.
