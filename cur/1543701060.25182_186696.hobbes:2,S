Subject: [RFC 0/5] sysfs backing store (leaves only)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi all,
The following patch set(mailed separately) implements a backing store 
mechanism for sysfs filesystem but only for leaf entires. In the previous 
attempt I tried to do backing store for all the entires in sysfs (directories 
& regular files) but that prototype had problems related to coherency between 
sysfs tree and VFS based dentry tree and solution for which will probably need 
VFS layer changes.
In leaves only backing store, attribute files, text or binary, are created on 
demand and there is no need to pin the dentries & inodes corresponding to 
such sysfs files. Generally there are around 60-70% leaf entries in sysfs
tree. Non-regular files (directories and symlinks) are pinned as usual. This
helps in solving the coherency problem as we can use the parent inode's (or
directory's) i_sem while creating, removing or walking files present in 
a given directory.
There are no changes in the way sysfs or kobjects are used. All interfaces
are same and function as without this patch.
Please review the patch set following this posting. I have also collected 
following numbers in support of the backing store.
Test1

Following test shows how dentries are created on demand and are pruned 
whenever there is a memory pressure.

Ran some memory stress test (mmapstress01 from ltp-full-20031106)
and parallely watching dentry statistics.

As the numbers are collected from /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state, they are for 
entire system. But because during measurement there were file creation/removal 
in sysfs tree only, I think we can consider most of them correspond to sysfs.
The test was done on a 4-way SMP box with 512 MB RAM.
Test 2
------
One more test I did was trying to create 4000 scsi_debug disks and observe the 
lowmem statistics on a 2-way SMP box with 4.5 GB RAM.
After creating 4000 debug disks we have the following stats: 
(Please bear that I couldn't actually create 4000 disks because of error I was 
getting regarding scsi generic device (minor number exceeded 255) but I was 
able to create lots of sysfs entries more than 50 thousand.
With backing store patch
========================

Without backing store 
=====================
		/proc/sys/fs/dentry-state; 			LowFree

cat /sys/block/sdk/queue/nr_requests
128
		71396   4115    45      0       0       0;        767540 kB
tree /sys  |tail -1

		71396   4115    45      0       0       0;        767340 kB
umount -f /sys
		71397   4116    45      0       0       0;        767340 kB
As we can see there is no change in Lowmem stats without patch when we
mount or unmount sysfs. Where as with backing store patch we can save approx. 
30 MB of lowmem in when sysfs files are not in use.
