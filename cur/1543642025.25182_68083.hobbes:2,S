And waste a block? With correct raid organization the controller takes up 
the job of your partition table. (Yes, regardless of where it' storing 
data.)

Anyway, that's news to me. Where?

Well, I'm talking about a vision of replacing partition tables with 
sensible and gentle disk handling, where possible. Old technics definitely 
need some other kind of hammer, or to get replaced.

You can't get that with partition tables either. And by the way, we 
succeeded doing that at Magdeburg. Pull out the power supply, batteries, 
etc., then run away.
Yes, we need better materia. Mind the biotechnical approach. Still doesn't 
qualify as a statement for partition tables.

That's why sensible raid systems do that on their own. In the meanwhile 
you can get around with the data. Mostly it's nothing more than a "find 
disk order", which is not too bad.

Then give them two logical disks. Just a matter of management.

Yes, that's cool in case we'd possibly need one. But in the raid cases we 
should get to a position where partition tables are not just theoretically 
meaningless.

I've still not said you'd have to do that. You can have a perl script do 
your job scribbling the table together.
