I should have summarised the discussion, sorry.
This has always been a semaphore, but it got changed it to a mutex as part
of a global switch recently - and this indeed generated bug reports
from people who turn debugging on and report the error messages.
So the quick fix in this patch was to put things back how they were.
Now mutex.h states:
 * - only the owner can unlock the mutex
 * - task may not exit with mutex held
 * These semantics are fully enforced when DEBUG_MUTEXES is
 * enabled.
Which begs the question whether the stated semantics are stricter than
is actually necessary.

Srinivasa added it as a precaution.
Device-mapper should never fall foul of it, but confirming that is not
trivial unless you know the code well, so it's a useful check to prevent a
bug creeping back in.
