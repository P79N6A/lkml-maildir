That's only because you never bother with drivers.
_Please_ look at the bigger picture.
1) I note you ignored Matthew Wilcox's example of module_init being used 
in two different ways.
2) "proper", converted-to-Rusty-style driver code is going to have
	MODULE_blah
	MODULE_foo
	MODULE_bar
	PARAM
You think that looks good??
3) modules a.k.a. drivers are going to be the more common users of this 
interface.
4) even where arch code uses boot cmdline params, they are typically 
clustered together, which makes their purpose all the more obvious.

Another namespace collision?  Who would have thought...
PARAM is ugly in drivers, and way too generic.
