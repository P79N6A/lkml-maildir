I also don't think this patch should go into the official tree, but in my
case it's because it's too closely related to the WINE userspace libraries;
it should become part of the WINE tree instead. (Note that this is how other
packages such as ALSA and lm_sensors are maintained.)
However, I don't see any problems with having a kernel module to emulate a
different API. We already have code to emulate different UNIX APIs in the
IBCS system; having some support for emulating the Win32 system call
interface could potentially be useful.

Flamebait, but I don't think this is true. WINE is very useful---plenty of
apps and games run on it, and it can be a real lifesaver if you get thrown a
self-extracting archive that unzip chokes on. (Note that Corel are using
WINE for Wordperfect Office under Unix now.) WINE's still-ALPHA status
reflects the caution of its developers rather than the quality of its code;
note that plenty of other packages (lesstif, kbd, WindowMaker, ORBit, ALSA,
bin86, esd, links etc.) still retain "alpha" (<1.0) version numbers despite
being stable, reliable and widely-used.
