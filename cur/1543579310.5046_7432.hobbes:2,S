What is the firmware revision of your Seagate drives?  There
were several models shipped in the recent past with firware that
would cause the drive to drop off the bus under high load.
There is also a known issue with U160 modes and the currently
embedded aic7xxx driver.  You might want to try the Adaptec
supported driver from here:

6.09 BETA should be released later today.
