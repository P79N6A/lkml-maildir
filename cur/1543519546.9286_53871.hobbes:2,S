Tell that to RedHat.

Debian ships with a set of known-good and stable kernel headers in
/usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm. Seems to work pretty well,
even though people like tytso don't really agree ;)
People just need to understand that you have to compile modules
with -I/usr/src/linux/include or -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.22/include
A Makefile fragment in /usr/src/linux (say, config.mk) that keeps
the CFLAGS that were used to compile the kernel would go a long
way to getting people to use -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.22/include
pretty much automatically.
Module Makefiles then would look like something like this:
# Point to kernel you want to build against
TOPDIR=/usr/src/linux
include $(KERNEL)/config.mk
