   Well, I've found that VM-global patch before, of course. Until now, the
last version was against pre18. Since I do not know the exact rules for
including new things into Alan's tree, I thought that VM-global patch was
already included in pre24. Sorry for my lack of experience. ;-)) I should
have checked it.
   As I wrote before, I had no time recently to follow the mailing list
carefully and I didn't know exactly what VM-global patch is.

   Ok, I can try it, at least.
   I will let you know about results.
   Martin.
