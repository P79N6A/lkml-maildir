Ah yes, sorry, forgot to add the comment.
This is microoptimization, both ->signal and ->sighand are cleared at the same
time in __exit_signal(), so we can check either. But we are using the value of
->sighand below, so it makes sense to read ->sighand, not ->signal.
Andrew, it is very easy to send the new patch to fix the code, but is it possible
to fix the changelog somehow for the patch in -mm tree?
Oleg.
