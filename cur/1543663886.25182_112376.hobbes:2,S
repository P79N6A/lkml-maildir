Hallo,
first I say sorry for your trouble with my bounce-mails.
This weekend I setup my new Mail-Backupserver. After this work I test a new 
version of my Spamcheck-script. In this script I call "rblcheck". My mistake 
was the test via list.dsbl.org. 
The big prob by my was that the powerline from my Primaryserver going offline. 
So the Backup-Server works with the bad script.
Sorry
Joerg
