OK, but currently after using mostly:
mutex_lock(&parent_class)
and once:
mutex_lock_nested(&parent_class, SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING)
lockdep mostly thinks these parent classes are 2 different objects,
with only 2 possible levels of nesting, so this parent_class has
to have wrong name (2 parents can't be locked from the same thread,
so maybe it's class_grandparent sometimes?).
