Exactly, it isn't a 'sound' device at all. It has a USB plug and plain
old headset/microphone cables which have to be put into the soundcard.
The pad itself has connectors for the headset/microphone, but those are
simply forwarded to the soundcard (there's the 'mute' button which can
be used to mute the microphone, and a volume wheel, but that's all it
can do with the sound).

Telephony/Headset category, why not use that?
