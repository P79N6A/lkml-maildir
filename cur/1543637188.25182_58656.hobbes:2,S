  It is more like EVMS has safety devices to prevent people from
getting caught up in the machinery.  In that respect it keeps
people from hurting themselves. And even if it is only when 
the are tired or in a hurry it is worth the effort. When you
have several 100 servers that you need to take care of any
help is appreciate.
Since most data loss is human error having a volume manager to 
enable people to have higher availability and not addressing 
the number one cause of data loss doesn't seem to make sense to 
me.
