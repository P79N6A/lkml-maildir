Subject: [PATCH 0 of 2] Stackfs: generic stackable filesystem helper functions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/13/62

The following patches introduce stackfs_copy_* functions. These functions
copy inode attributes (such as {a,c,m}time, mode, etc.) from one inode to
another.
While, intended for stackable filesystems any portion of the kernel wishing
to copy inode attributes can use them.
This series consists of two patches, the first introduces the stackfs
functions, and the second makes eCryptfs a user.
