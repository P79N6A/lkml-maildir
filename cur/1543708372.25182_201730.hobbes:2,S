That is the problem... I didn't check my OF spec, but I do remember
clearly cases where the "unit address" isn't unique... This happens
typically at the root of the device-tree, or with pseudo devices,
where you can have several entries with an @0 unit address. However,
I yet have to see that for things that are worth putting into sysfs ;)
One thing though is that it's only unique at a given level of
hierarchy. The Unit Address in OF has no meaning outside of the
context of the parent bus. That may be just fine for sysfs, but
if I take as an example the PCI devices, they do have a globally
unique ID here with the domain number.
