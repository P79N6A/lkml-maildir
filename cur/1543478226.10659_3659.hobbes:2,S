If your point is that destructor-based cleanup doesn't cover
everything -- well, it's a fair cop.  But manual cleanup with 'try'
and 'catch' is the obvious case; I thought it was necessary to
demonstrate the destructor-based approach, since it covers lots of
things and is much easier to verify correct.
