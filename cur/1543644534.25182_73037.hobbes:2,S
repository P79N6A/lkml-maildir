I would suspect console_init(). I believe some kind of change was
done here for preempt bootstrap ordering issues (vm86_info: BAD) as
it's a bit too early to schedule here. Things have gotten interesting
down here in other contexts where sleeping and/or waitqueue fiddling
is illegal so early on. Getting a better stack dump might be helpful.
I'll see if I can do that soon.
Cheers,
Bill
