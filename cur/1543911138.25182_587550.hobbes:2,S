The dual license is at the top of the file.
I just need to know when you touch one of these dual-license files
that Intel has your permission to ship your change to folks we
send the same file to under the BSD-style non-GPL license.
eg. BSD, Solaris and HPUX uses this same ACPICA files -- though in a
different format.
I've actually never had anybody say no when I asked.
And I've had some people who play laywers on TV tell me
this is not strictly necessary, but other people who play laywers
on TV tell me it is best to ask, so I do.
thanks,
