I disagree.  Ben's switch-mm approach deserves deeper examination than
that.  It's both simple and powerful.  And it's already done by AIO's
use_mm - the big differences being, of course, that the kthread has
no original mm of its own, and it's limited in what it gets up to.
What would be the actual problems with ptrace temporarily adopting
another's mm?  What are our existing assumptions?
We do already have the minor issue that expand_stack uses the wrong
task's rlimits (there was a patch for that, perhaps Nick's fault
struct would help make it less intrusive to fix - I was put off
it by having to pass an additional arg down so many levels).

I find Ben's idea more appealing; but agree it _may_ prove unworkable.
