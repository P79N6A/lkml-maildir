Why is the switch sending you all that traffic for VLAN's you don't
care about? I have a hard time imagining such a scenario. Sure, you
could have forgotten to limit the VLAN range sent to a particular
host, or even have decided that it's administratively easier to just
allow everything, but the switch still won't send unicast traffic out
that port unless the destination MAC matches. If broadcast or
non-solicited multicast takes up most of your bandwidth, you have
other problems.
