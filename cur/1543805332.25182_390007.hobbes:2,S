But it doesn't say the unlocking thread must yield to the new mutex
owner, only that the scheduling policy shall determine the which
thread aquires the lock.
It doesn't say that decision must be made immediately, either (eg.
it could be made as a by product of which contender is chosen to run
next).
I think the intention of the wording is that for deterministic policies,
it is clear that the waiting threads are actually worken and reevaluated
for scheduling. In the case of SCHED_OTHER, it means basically nothing,
considering the scheduling policy is arbitrary.
