The way autoconf should be used acording to the autoconf manual is already
wrong and the creation of just another makefile generator, that even is 
incorrectly called "automake", is definitely a step into the wrong direction.
David Korn recently discovered that my makefile system basically does the same 
as his system. But while he need to write a "make successor" "nmake", I was able 
to do the same using "make".
The ideas that I am sucessfully using since more than 12 years is what researchers
did start around 1985. 
GNU autoconf (used the documented way) or "automake" is trying to do things in 
a way that did look apropriate in the 1970s. 
People should look at better solutions (like my makefile system) that do not 
need to modify makefiles in place but rather implement object oriented design
that depend on a "table like" master makefile and for this reason allow to 
concurrently compile on _all_ supported platforms on the same source tree
in case that the tree is mounted via NFS.

Try to use my smake to find out whether you use non-portable constructs.
Smake warns you about the most common problems in makefiles.

The more rotten Linux interfaces become, the harder it is to implement work
arounds.

It seems that Linux is not used for developing SCSI applications, otherwise
I would not be the only person complaining about this missing feature.
I am using SunOS/Solaris for my SCSI programs since 1985, so I don't have 
problem. It seems that Linux users don't like to know if their software fails.
