This already happens.  This is why all accesses to the module are
protected by try_module_get().
I've analyzed dozens of "here's my implementation idea" mails over the
last two years.  Here's the executive summary:
1) It's simply not a good idea to force 1600 modules to change, no
   matter what timescale.  And changing it in a way that is *more*,
   not *less* complex is even worse.
2) It's bad enough to force the interfaces to change: at least the
   primitive they are to use is one many of them are already using,
   and is very simple to understand.
Rusty.
PS.  The *implementation* flaw in your scheme: someone starts using a
     module as you try to deregister it.  Either you re-register the
     module (ie. you can never unload security modules), or you leave
     it half unloaded (even worse).
