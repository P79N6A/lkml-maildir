Yes, you are right. I was just looking for this preempt-problem where a 
flush_tlb* was done, but there are many other places where this problem 
occours, too... Nearly everywhere where smp_call_function() is used!
I found a function in the file mm/slab.c called smp_call_function_all_cpus() 
which tries to do the thing we want, but I think not even this function is 
preempt-safe...!
But here I think I better get off my fingers, I just wanted to help a bit with 
this issue, but I don't think I have the time and knowledge to solve it 
completely in the mentioned good way...
Perhaps even the semantic of the function smp_call_function() could be changed 
to call the function on every CPU? Just an idea...
Best regards
