Hello!
  I found that drivers/net/slip.c in 2.2 and in 2.3 is not jiffy wrap proof.
  it has this code 'if (jiffies - dev->trans_start  < 20 * HZ)  {'
  It may be even ok in 2.2, as a lot of net drivers use almost the same
  code, but I see that in 2.3 nobody except slip.c uses that, so
  here is the patch. 
  It applies to 2.2 and to 2.3 (with some fuzz, thou)
