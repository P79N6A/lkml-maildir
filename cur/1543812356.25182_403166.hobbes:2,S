I went through all the in-kernel places where we call ->getblock()
and initialized b_size correctly.

Good point.

Yep.

Good news is, filesystems that allocate a single block currently don't
care about b_size anyway.
I guess to be paranoid, we should add WARN_ON() or BUG_ON() in jfs, xfs,
ext3 (in -mm) ->getblock() to check for a valid b_size, before using it
(not being negitive, multiple of blocksize, not-a-huge-number type
checks ?).
Thanks,
