Well, plain test_bit() has always been more relaxed than the others, and
has never implied a memory barrier. Only the "test_and_set/clear()" things
imply memory barriers.
What we _could_ do (without changing any existing rules) is to add a
"__test_bit()" that is the relaxed version that doesn't do any of the
volatile etc. That would match the "__"  versions of the other bit
operations.
Then people who know that they use the bits without any volatility issues 
can use that one, and let the compiler optimize more. 
Hmm?
