The RH installer probably still had the workarounds in it that it had for
the 6.0 release. Early 2.2 tended to stop if it was totally idle, had a lot
in ram (or very little ram) and did a lot of writes mkfs style. It almost
only happens on install tools.
That was fixed during mid 2.2 I forget exactly where. There are still 2.2 
open questions with currnet 2.2 but only when creating _very_ large file
systems with little memory, where the write throttling may still need a bit
of work.
