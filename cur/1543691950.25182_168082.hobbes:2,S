I want to created the smallest, fastest kernel that supports all the 
necessary features of a given system.
Obviously, the answer is very system dependent, requiring a keen 
knowledge of the relationships between hardware and Linux components.
Unless I'm missing something (always a possibility), the kernel 
configurations do not provide a clear idea of component size. In other 
words, if I include "burfulgunk port support" in my kernel build, I'd 
like to have a rough idea of the component's size. I might not need to 
support the "burfulgunk", especially if it's a large component (for, 
say, a legacy port.)
I'm well aware that code sizes differ between platforms; I'm looking for 
general information, as a guideline to generating a small kernel.
