Exactly that, and kernel interfaces going away just to annoy binary
module providers also hurts third-party OSS modules, such as
Fujitsu-Siemens's ServerView agents.
I found myself chasing some genuine bugs in that code to please GCC 4
(which doesn't tolerate extern blah declarations before static blah
definitions), and some idiotic breakage when inter_module_get was
dropped somewhen between 2.6.8 (where the modules compiled just fine)
and 2.6.13 (where they didn't as functions had been removed).  And
there's no point arguing about deprecation warnings being around,
interfaces can be removed between 2.6 and 2.8 but not between
2.6.foo.bar and 2.6.foo.baz. Why not use
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,8,0)
or similar to automatically disable such interfaces at the given
version?

Right. This effectively means to call the beast 2.8.0 if you feel you
must break the applications.

Well, the current model, since it has been in effect, is just "let's
break the interfaces at will, but let's not hint anyone, so let's always
just bump the patchlevel no matter how intrusive the change is", and the
bandaid 2.6.M.N releases cannot cover the fact that the M -> M+1
transition causes breakage.
Effectively, 2.6.X behaves like a bleeding edge development ("everything
changes") kernel such as 2.3 or 2.5; it isn't stable because some code
monkeys claim it is. You cannot declare the can of pea soup in front of
you "open" either.
Linux is in fact light years away from being "stable", and while it was
relatively easy to move forward between 2.4.X releases and even 2.4.X
and some early 2.6.X release, moving between 2.6.X and 2.6.Y means
switching user-space, too, and chances are the new user-space doesn't
work with the old kernel.
