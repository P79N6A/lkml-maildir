Yes there was filesystem damage; when I tried to unmount /usr (where I did
the make) during a shutdown I got lots of
	try_to_unuse: entry 10720000000000 count=1
	try_to_unuse: entry 10730000000000 count=1
	try_to_unuse: entry 10740000000000 count=1
etc., for many (but not all consecutive) entries and fsck later found minor
repairable damage.  Whew!
The filesystem in question is an ext2fs via an Adaptec AHA-294X Ultra SCSI
host adapter.

Swap is on the same disk.
