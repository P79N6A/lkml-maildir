To be very clear.  Enhancing the LSM is of interest to me as it looks
like that is a way to get people working and playing well together,
and that ultimately to be able to run a full distro in a container
I'm going to need this ability.
Examples of better ways to do this in selinux, LIDS, or SMACK are only
interesting as far as they suggest how to enhance the LSM.
I honestly think enhancing the LSM would actually reduce it's ability
to be abused, because nothing would directly own the hook.
My very practical question:  How do I run selinux in one container,
and SMACK in another?
