Hi All,
I've just released v0.0.6 of Linux-LDM which supports Windows Dynamic
Disks.  Windows 2000 and XP have new partition scheme to support their
dynamic volumes.
The source can be downloaded from the project page:
  
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
This version should be pretty solid, but if you experience any problems,
please let me know.  If there are no reports, I'll consider replacing
the old driver (2.4.10+) with this one.
Cheers,
