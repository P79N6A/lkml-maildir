   	It is high time this problem is acknowledged and FIXED. I am
   forced to share a network with a bunch of NT servers, some of which get
   plenty of traffic-- enough so that they manage to crowd out my machine to
   the tune of 600ish ms ping times to the Linux box versus only **70**
   (!!!!!!) to the Windows box.
Changes to TCP and therefore anything having to do with
slow-start is not going to have any effect on ping times.
To me this sounds like a problem somewhere else, perhaps a driver
issue.
