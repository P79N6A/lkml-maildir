Hi all,
I am having some problems with 2.6.8-rc4-mm1
1- In syslog I am getting messages like :
Probing IDE interface ide0...
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
Probing IDE interface ide1...
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
Probing IDE interface ide2...
ide2: Wait for ready failed before probe !
Probing IDE interface ide3...
ide3: Wait for ready failed before probe !
Probing IDE interface ide4...
ide4: Wait for ready failed before probe !
Probing IDE interface ide5...
ide5: Wait for ready failed before probe !
2- Penguin logo doesn't show up in console though framebuffer is enabled.
Any ideas?
