Actually Ingo, I think it might be a good time to create a RT list. I'm
much more interested in this topic than the average stuff that is on the
LKML.  The reason I'm more for setting up a mailing list, is that I keep
missing stuff that is related to your patch because there's no common
subject line. For instance, I missed the first 4 messages in this thread
since it didn't have anything about RT in the subject.  If there wasn't
a fifth message, I would never have seen the previous messages.
If anything, please have RT in the Subject.
Thank you,
-- Steve
