D'oh. There is _one_ place where you can't control it with setterm -
initial messages upon boot. Dunno why it might be needed, but anyway:
paletter sits in color_table[], default_{red,grn,blu}[], colors are set in
vc_init() (all in drivers/char/console.c). But really, what's the point of
that exercise? Use setterm in rc scripts and there you go. It's not like
you were going to see boot messages that often...
