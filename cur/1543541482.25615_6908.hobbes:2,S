Would Linus take it?  This sort of seems like the wrong time in 2.3 to be 
doing anything but fixing existing stuff.  Which is why I was planning on an 
early 2.4.  Get it in after the 2.4.0 dust settles.
However, I've been thinking about submitting to 2.3.  I'm kind of running out 
of things to do that really need doing and 2.4 isn't on the horizon yet.
