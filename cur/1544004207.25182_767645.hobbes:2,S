.28 was a bit optimistic; .29 seems reasonable.  The current dom0 kernel 
patches can boot up to a fully functional dom0 usersmode, and you can 
start xend to see that domain 0 is running.  I *think* in theory you can 
create a deviceless domain, but I haven't tried it.  I'm currently 
working on blktap support.
I really need to put together a proper status update.  Now that dom0 
usermode is working, its a much better base for other people start 
contributing.
