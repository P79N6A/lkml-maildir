OK, mucho more info (no wonder root=/dev/hde5 no worky):
        VP_IDE: (ide_setup_pci_device:) Could not enable device
Found out my on board via pci ide was not getting initialized under
-test2-mm1, so I went looking for driver/ide/pci/via82cxxx in the diffs.
I found this in the -test2 diff:
-                                    (((u >> i) & 7) < 8))) {
+                                    (((u >> i) & 7) < 6))) {
...and reversing it did not change anything.
The only other diff I could think might matter to 
drivers/ide/setup-pci.c
-static unsigned long __init ide_get_or_set_dma_base (ide_hwif_t *hwif)
+static unsigned long ide_get_or_set_dma_base (ide_hwif_t *hwif)
...which does not look like it should kill my via ide...
I am now totally at my wit's end. Can I be helped now that I got off my
fat arse?
