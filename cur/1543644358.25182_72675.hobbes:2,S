The intent is to split LTT, get the infrastructure into the kernel, have
the trace points as patches.

:-) It does do something.  It provides a common infrastructure for anyone
wanting to use trace points.  What I meant is that when not enabled it
doesn't cause any overhead.
As a performance tool it will be used not only be kernel developers but by
people writing device drivers, sub-systems, and apps.  Having an accepted
infrastructure in the kernel allows a common vocabulary to be used across
kernel, devices, sub-systems, and applications.  It allows sub-system
developers who know their system best to put in the events and developers
of other sub-systems of apps to use those events to understand what is
going on.  If the infrastructure is in the kernel, users could dynamically
enable and feedback performance results to the kernel developers.
In short this will provide a common way to discuss performance issues
across kernel, sub-system, and application space.

Good - I'm glad you find tracing useful - sorry if I reacted to the
statement that most of the time it's not needed.  As above, it should be in
the kernel proper not as just a patch.

No, we use lock-free atomic operations to reserve a place in the buffer to
write the data.  What happens is you attempt to atomic move the current
index pointer forward.  If you succeed then you have bought yourself that
many data words in the queue.  In the unlikely event you happened to
collide with someone you perform the atomic operation again.
