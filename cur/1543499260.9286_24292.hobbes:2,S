Low scheduling latencies has nothing to do with micro/monolithic kernels

The Linux limitation is very much that our file system is not designed to
provide real time guarantees but to get maximum work done. Irix XFS actually
has the notion of being able to open a file and reserve bandwidth on it.
Being able to open a file and say "guarantee me 2Mbits/second" is a very
powerful facility.
