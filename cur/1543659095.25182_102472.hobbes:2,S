I think you have to select DOS filesystem first and MSDOS fs support, 
then it shows up.

It doesn't currently, but it should.
Patch to 2.4.20 vanilla is attached, it should apply with some fuzz to

Not sure whether this is true, I'm not quite sure.
And plus I don't know enough about Config.ins to write that into the 
patch (Is it even possible in 2.4's Kconfig?)
