In your last message you say "who wants to use this stuff except IBM
anyway", where "this stuff" includes SMP.  That statement is both absurd
and inflammatory.  Therefore you are a troll.
If I have to explain why you are also stupider than I thought.
Anyway, thanks for your posts - now I know how to use the kill file in
Evolution 2.0.
