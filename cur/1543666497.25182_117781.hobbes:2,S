Being a big fan of quoting myself; the above statement is not entirely
accurate. This is the error I get when
"ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL device support" is built in and
"Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tape/floppy support" built as module
In case both are built as module I get:

Is there a reason that no entries of "IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block devices"
are not being merged into "ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL device support"?
