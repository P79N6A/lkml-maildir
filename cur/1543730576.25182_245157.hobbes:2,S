What's the essential difference between ramfs and tmpfs anyway?
I've gotten the impression that ramfs is simpler and lighter-weight than
tmpfs, but doesn't have some features like resource-limiting.
If that's the case, then for something like /dev -- a small in-core
filesystem that won't have arbitrary user files plunked into it -- ramfs
seems an obvious choice.
Also, tmpfs seems to require an MMU, which not all linux systems have
(though I suppose the lack of an MMU makes many security tweaks a bit
pointless :-).
