It's because XFS's pagebuf_daemon calls interruptible_sleep_on without
holding the big kernel lock. While what it's doing is pretty ugly,
it's in fact not dangerous in thise case. I am seeing the same on an
ia64, but it only shows up a couple of times and then quiets down and
it boots fine.
If you want, you can remove the SLEEP_ON_BKLCHECK in
kernel/sched.c:interruptible_sleep_on() until a proper fix comes out.
Or even better, rewrite the code in xfs/pagebuf/pagebuf.c to do the
right thing instead.
Cheers,
Jes
