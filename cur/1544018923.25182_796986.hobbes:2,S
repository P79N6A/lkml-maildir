Yeah. I had some suggestions about that already...the problem with that
is that you can't know whether measured latencies are due to SMIs /or/
other kernel latencies - maybe there's a bug or other problem? I really
want to be able to say to vendors "nope, it's definitely your problem".
So I think what'll end up happening is a user process for ease of
deployment but something like smi_detector for advanced diagnostics. And
then I just hope others will write tools like the one IBM already has
that will turn off extraneous SMI generation :)
Jon.
