Yes, this is the expected and documented behavior. Nothing wrong with
this. It's the same as saying, "Without KMOD modules autoloading support
modules are not autoloaded", which is quite obvious. So there isn't any
need to disallow this in kernel configuration.

Driver? Open devices? Drivers don't do that ...

Yes. It's as simple as 'if you don't use kmod, you have to insert
modules manually or have them in the kernel'. PPPD will complain about
no kernel PPP support if you don't do that. That's OK.

Why should they depend on them? You sure can run an uncompressed PPP
link. And PPPD doesn't require them - it just needs them to be able to
do compression. So, if you insmod them or compile into the kernel, it's
OK. If you have KMOD, the're requested and it's OK. Where is the
problem?
In the old days when Kerneld/KMOD didn't exist, it was all done the
manual way. I see no reason to forbid that now - it's often very useful.
I don't run KMOD on my system. I don't need it. So why should I be
forced to?
