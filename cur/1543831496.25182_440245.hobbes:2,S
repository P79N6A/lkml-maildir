I think he is talking about another problem. RAID addresses detectable 
failures at the hardware level. I believe that he wants validation after 
the data is returned (without error) from the device. While in most 
cases if what you wrote and what you read don't match it's memory, 
improving the chances of catching the error is useful, given that 
non-server often lacks ECC on memory, or people buy cheaper non-parity 
memory.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
