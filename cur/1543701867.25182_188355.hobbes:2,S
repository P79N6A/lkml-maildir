:> Hmm, it shouldn't be reporting irq 0.  The probbing code may be confused.

:irq0 on x86 means "I'll use polled mode".
Does this imply a performance reduction whether or not I actually have a
device connected to the port? And would this imply that the serial port
should remain functional despite there being no interrupt line assigned to
it?
What sort of performance degradation (in terms of CPU utilization, latency,
throughput, or otherwise) can I expect from a serial port operating in
polled mode?
Thanks,
Amit
