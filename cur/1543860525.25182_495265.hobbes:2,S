Not the same exact thing -- using a text representation for
the property contents is a very different thing (and completely
braindead).

The problem is that it is almost impossible to consolidate the
current OF code.  It would be possible to consolidate the
filesystem code only though (and that's a good plan of course).

It's so much easier to start from scratch in this case ;-)

Let's not base it on the PowerPC code, we don't want /proc.
How about this as a high-level design, it would be simple for
the OLPC guys to implement, and very easy for the other archs
to hook up to:
Every architecture that supports the device tree filesystem,
initialises a "struct device_tree_ops" with a bunch of
pointers to functions that allow you to traverse the device
tree and read its properties (and maybe write properties, or
even delete and create new nodes.  The devtree filesystem code
simply calls into these functions to do the actual operations
on the device tree (access an in-kernel data structure, call
the OF, or both -- or something entirely different, who knows).
