In current implementation, when saving the memory image of hibernated
kernel in hibernating kernel, the jump back entry from kernel command
line should be saved at the same time, or the jump back entry from
kernel command line can be saved as entry point of ELF hibernated image
file by a modified makedumpfile. That is, 
- method 1:
jbe=`cat /proc/cmdline | tr -d ' ' '\n' | grep kexec_jump_back_entry | cut -d '=' -f 2`
cp /proc/vmcore .
echo $jbe > kexec_jump_back_entry
- method 2:
jbe=`cat /proc/cmdline | tr -d ' ' '\n' | grep kexec_jump_back_entry | cut -d '=' -f 2`
makedumpfile <other options> -j $jbe /proc/vmcore <image file>
Method 2 is better, because "jump back entry" is the very entry point of
the hibernated image. The vmcore implementation can be changed to set
entry point of /proc/vmcore if "kexec_jump_back_entry" kernel command
line option is present. I did not add this to kernel because it can be
done by user space tool "makedumpfile", and one of the guideline is to
keep kernel part as simple as possible.
With method 2, the ordinary "core file" and "hibernated image" can be
distinguished by the "entry point".
The "jump back entry" can be saved with PT_NOTE too. And more
information can be saved with PT_NOTE. I have ever defined another
mechanism to pass information between two kernels too. I will describe
it later in this mail.

One original page will map to one backup page (the contents of original
page and backup page will be swapped). It is possible that the entries
number of map equals the number of backup pages.
If the helper kernel B uses 16M memory, there will be 4096 backup pages.
One PT_LOAD header is needed for each backup page to record the map
between the original page to the backup page. So, the memory needed for
PT_LOAD headers will be 32 * 4k = 128k.
If the size of PT_LOAD headers and the "readability" of headers
information of /proc/vmcore is not a big issue, I think this is a good
idea.
In addition to revising the ELF headers in purgatory, the /proc/kimgcore
interface can also be used to revise the ELF headers in kernel A. But
this needs to export backup pages map information to user space (another
sysfs/procfs file?).

Yes. This seems better. I will change it.

I think there may be no difference between two kinds of files. Nothing
prevents hibernated image produced through /proc/vmcore loaded with
normal kexec -l. I have just tested it. This means we need not use
krestore to resume the hibernated kernel after enhancing /sbin/kexec
(because it uses too much anonymous memory). And, the resuming process
will be more smooth.
For completion (although may be not a big issue now):
Whether using "krestore" or normal "kexec -l" depends on the memory used
by current kernel (/proc/iomem) and memory in image file (PT_LOAD
headers). If all memory in image file is outside memory used by current
kernel, "krestore" should be used. If all memory in image file is inside
memory used by current kernel, normal "kexec -l" should be used. If
there is intersection set between memory in image file and memory of
current kernel, the image file can not be loaded.

In current implementation, the PT_NOTE does not work, so a kernel
command line can be used to pass the information. And it can be changed
for each resuming. easier than changing PT_NOTE.

Yes. It is dangerous. This is not a good example. But, I think it is a
useful feature. For example, the "setup page" you proposed later can be
setup via amending /proc/kimgcore.
And, it is more useful for "invoking some code in physical mode". The
procedure is something as follow:
1. load some code executing in physical mode via kexec --load-preserve-context.
2. setup the parameters via amending /proc/kimgcore
3. execute the code in physical mode via kexec -e
4. get the result via reading /proc/kimgcore
5. setup another groups of parameters via amending /proc/kimgcore

Yes. A communication mechanism is needed between two kernels. The "setup
page" and "PT_NOTE" earlier you proposed are two such mechanisms. It
seems that the "setup page" is more powerful. I have defined a mechanism
like "setup page" in my previous version. It is as follow:
1. The second half of "control page" is used as the "setup page". That
is, jump_back_entry + 0x800.
2. A magic number is provided in "setup page" to let krestore to
distinguish between "normal executable" and "hibernated iamge" by check
the magic number.
3. Other information such as vmcoreinfo can be added to "setup page".
4. Before one kernel jump to another kernel, the parameters are prepared
by current kernel.
5. One kernel can check the parameters of another kernel by
reading /proc/vmcore or /proc/kimgcore.
6. When memory image is saved in file. The parameters of hibernated
kernel can be check by reading memory location jump_back_entry + 0x800.
You can check the details of this mechanism in my previous patch with
title:
[PATCH 1/4 -mm] kexec based hibernation -v7 : kexec jump
The main issue of this mechanism is that: it is a kernel-to-kernel
communication mechanism, while Eric Biederman thinks we should use only
user-to-user communication mechanism. And he is not persuaded now.
Because kernel operations such as re-initialize/re-construct
the /proc/vmcore, etc are needed for kexec jump or resuming. I think a
"kernel-to-kernel" mechanism may be needed. But I don't know if Eric
Biederman will agree with this.
