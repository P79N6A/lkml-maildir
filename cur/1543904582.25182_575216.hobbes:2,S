Hi,
Very below is my patch proposal with a comment, which in my opinion
is precious enough to save it for future help in reading and
understanding the code.
I hope Alan will not blame me I've not asked for his permission before
sending, and he would ack this patch as it is or at least most of this.
Thanks & regards,
Jarek P.
