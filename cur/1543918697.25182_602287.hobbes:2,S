Hmm.  If that is in the LSB it must come from
Documentation/devices.txt  I'm not after changing the user
visible major/minor assignments.
Let me see if a concrete example will help.  Suppose I have
have a SAN with two disks:  disk-1 and disk-2.  I have
two machines A and B.  On machine A I get the mapping:
sda -> disk-1, sdb ->disk-2.  On machine B I wind up with
a different probe order so I get the mapping: sda -> disk-2
sdb ->disk-1.
To be very clear by sda I mean the block device with major 8 and
minor 0, and by sdb I mean the block device with major 8 and minor
16.
So I decide I want an environment on machine B that looks just
like the environment on machine A, so I can bring transfer over
a running program or whatever.  So I run around looking at UUID
labels and what not and I discover that the machine B knows disk-1 as
sdb and that machine A knows disk-1 as sda.  So I want to say:
/sys/devices/block/sdb show up in this other device namespace as
/sys/devices/block/sda.
In that instance a running program won't notice the difference.
