> o Fix kwhich versus old bash (Pete Zaitcev) 
A small clarification may be in order here.
First, this patch comes from Miquel Smoorenburg, not from me.
Second, DaveM pointed out that it fixes a non-problem.
I stepped on a bug with an obscure kernel, I think it
was 2.2.18-pre3, which called kwhich with several arguments.
Current kernels call kwhich with one argument at a time,
so they are not affected.
