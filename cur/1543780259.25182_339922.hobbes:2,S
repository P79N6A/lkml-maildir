I don't see anything about SMM in my BIOS configuration even with the
advanced options enabled... Turning it off at the chipset level sounds
like a hardware hack - is it?
The gettimeofday patch for 2.6.13-rc3 won't apply. My source tree has
no ntp.h or ntp.c, and I get a malformed patch error at line 560. I'm
using the patch Google found for me:

on a 2.6.13-rc3 source tree.
