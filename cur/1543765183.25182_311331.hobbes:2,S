That's clear.
You said you've read Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt .
Please read the USB example in this document as an example when even API 
compatibility was a problem.

If you upgrade your kernel, you'll also upgrade the modules shipped with 
the kernel.

What's an "optimal kernel"?
In a closed-sourse system, there's usually the OS plus API+ABI for 
driver writers and the drivers are often shipped with the hardware.
Therefore API+ABI compatibility is required.
In an open source system, it's usually more common that all drivers are 
shipped with the kernel. Therefore, there isn't such a big need for 
API+ABI compatibility since you can change all modules using an API when 
changing an API. And ABI compatibility isn't required because you can 
recompile the modules every time you recompile the kernel.
ABI compatibility between kernel versions costs the following:
- space for all users of the kernel
- speed of the kernel
- much extra work and checking when doing any changes
Nobody claims API+ABI compatibility was technically impossible in the 
Linux kernel. It's simply a consensus among the kernel developers that 
the small advantages of ABI compatibility are not worth the costs.
