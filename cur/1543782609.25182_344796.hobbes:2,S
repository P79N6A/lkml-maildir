Subject: Telling Linux that a SATA device has gone away

I have a laptop (Dell Latitude D610) that has a removable DVD drive.  It
appears to be a PATA device, but is presented under ata_piix so behaves
like a SCSI drive. With the ACPI generic hotkey driver, I can get events
when it's removed and reinserted. Is there any way I can tell Linux that 
the device has been removed? hdparm's bus registration support 
(unsurprisingly) doesn't seem to work too well on sr0, but echoing 
"remove-single-device 1 0 0 0" to /proc/scsi/scsi doesn't seem to do 
anything either.
