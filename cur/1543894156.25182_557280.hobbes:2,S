But I also made this decision fully aware that the software included
in the package was published under a license that said I was entitled
to modify it.  More than once I purchased a device that claimed to
have GNU/Linux software on it, only to find out that I couldn't use
the freedoms, because the distributor was infringing the license in
various ways.

Sure.  But wouldn't it be nice if the copyright holder could also help
in this effort?  It doesn't mean the copyright holder has to: s/he can
always grant an additional permission, or simply refrain from
enforcing this provision of the license.
