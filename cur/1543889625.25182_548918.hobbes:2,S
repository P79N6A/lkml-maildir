We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.20.12 kernel.
This release has a single security fix in it for the geode-aes driver.
Users with this driver are definitely recommended to upgrade, without
the fix there is risk of leaking confidential data.
f66e4a94: GEODE-AES: Allow in-place operations [CVE-2007-2451]
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.20.11 and 2.6.20.12
The updated 2.6.20.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.20.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
