Any ideas on the Tx errors?
Are they Tx FIFO errors on the NIC?
If so which one?
I have this problem on 2.2.x kernels, running the Symbios scsi/ethernet
combo (PCNet32 driver), when running on 100Base lan, but none on ten. It
appears to be largely occuring when connecting to an HP-UX 11.x server
(CVS and NFS).
