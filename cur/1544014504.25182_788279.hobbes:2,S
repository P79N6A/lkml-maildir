I expected that :(
By any chance, the datasheet doesn't explain why SMBus block
transactions of size 32 lock the chip, nor how to work around it?

OK. BTW, designing a system with an SMBus master which is so clearly
inappropriate for the I2C chips that are connected to it wasn't exactly
smart to start with. Whoever did this should be told to think twice
about it next time.
