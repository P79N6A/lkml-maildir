I had the exact same problem last night with kernel 2.3.28-pre3.  I
tried to start up the X frontend to linuxconf on a remote box, and it
hung my X server (XFree86 3.3.5, Voodoo3).  I killed linuxconf on the
remote box, tried killing the X server, and then tried to do a reboot
which just hung.  I finally had to hit the reset switch.  I looked for
any oopses in the syslog but could not find any.
