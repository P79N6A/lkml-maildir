Well, "alias" interfaces really don't exist.  ethX:iw is really just 
adding a address record (struct in_ifaddr) to ethX.  So in the current 
core design, adding an alias without an address is really adding the 
alias with address 0.0.0.0.  And I think the core net code assumes if an 
in_ifaddr struct exists for a device, then its IP address is indeed valid.
So I think the changes wouldn't be small to enhance the design to add a 
concept of an alias interface.
I'll look into this more though.
Steve.
