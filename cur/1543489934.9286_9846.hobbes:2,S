Hello all,
	Sorry for sending this mail to this list. [ Which is the right
list?]
	My mail server is a SVR4 variant. I have to telnet from
my machine [ Linux 5.2 Red hat] to the mail server to check mails. I want
to use procmail [to filter out junk mail I have been getting lately] on my
mailbox. How can I do this?   
					thanks, action.
