Setserial doesn't have facilities to set open flags for the ports.  The
reason cua isn't needed is that the programmer can make a ttyS port look
like a cua port by using the O_NONBLOCK or O_NDELAY flags.  However the
non-blocking flag will not only force an open when CD is asserted, but
will make all reads of the port non-blocking.  So the programmer can
change this if he wants after the port has opened.
So eliminating cua means more work for the programmer but less confusion
for users.  Overall, it's a good thing since there are many more users
than programmers.
