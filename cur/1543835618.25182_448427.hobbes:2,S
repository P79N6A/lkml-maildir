I think the name, "lightweight" is too generic. It implies just lw_rwlock
is better than rwlock. The name may lead that people use lw_rwlock rather 
than rwlock any place through there are places where rwlock is better than
lw_rwlock. So I looked for the name:
sw_rwlock: seldom writing rwlock
wp_rwlock: write pricey rwlock
rp_rwlock: read prioritized rwlock
If you could find good one, plesae use it instead.
