Well. forgives me :)
I have re turned NAPI On and my box is still happy 19H later...
So it's obviously not napi.
The problem is beetween the 2 incarnations of kernel (2.6.11.7 with
kswapd meesages on thoses who works well), I've changed some more options
Not exactly the best way to track bugs :(
Anyway i'll try to catch THE option that make the kernel not so happy
under heavy stress. Stay tuned,
