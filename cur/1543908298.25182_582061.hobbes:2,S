NAK
I've no problem with the basic idea of removing the names from user
space, but you've just demonstrated with the patch below that it causes
some quite revolting changes for the bad in code which previously was
nicely done switch statements and is now a nest of string compares and
inline code.
There are very good reasons to have a cookie in the sysctl entry for
internal use and which is private to the subsystem using the sysctl (ie
not for sysctl() use and not neccessarily unique).
