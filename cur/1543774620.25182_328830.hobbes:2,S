I tried the Yealink patch on 2.6.12 with the same results. All kernels 
up to 2.6.12-git8 (without the yealink patch) recognise the keypad, it's 
registered in /sys and looks good, but udev doesn't seem to create a 
device for it. udev on SuSE 9.3 is 053, but probably is modified beyond 
figuring out exactly how it stacks up against 058.
  # less /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb3/3-2/3-2:1.3/interface
Keypad
The manufacturer's blurb says it works under Linux, but I can't get a 
reply from them.
Regards
Sid.
