we simply need a cond_resched_bkl() for that, no? Very few places are
still serialized with the BKL, so I don't think it would be a big issue
to convert those few places to use cond_resched_bkl.

eheh ;)

sure, that's especially true for the hardirq and softirq total scheduler
offloading. The real question is where a generic desktop positions. I
doubt on a generic desktop a latency over 1msec matters much,
top performance of repetitive tasks that sums up like hardirqs for a NIC
sounds more sensible to me.
And for the other usages RTAI or any other hard realtime sounds safer
anyways.

definitely. Note that this could be simply fixed by having a
CONFIG_PREEMPT around it, but the real fix is definitely to make
cond_resched a noop with PREEMPT=y and secondly to add a
cond_resched_bkl defined as the current cond_resched as suggested above.

I hope so, he said the latest patches were cleaned up and he removed the
debugging/performance cruft (the most explicit message was
20040719115952.GA13564@elte.hu) but it's still not clear to me if he
left the CONFIG_VOLOUNTARY_PREEMPT config option because he intends to
merge it or just temporarily. Comments?
Thanks.
