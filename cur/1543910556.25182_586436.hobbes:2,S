GPUs have almost no influence on system security, the network stack OTOH
is probably the most vulnerable part of an operating system. Even if all
vendors would implement all the features collected over the last years
properly which seems unlikely. Having such an essential and critical
part depend on the vendor of my network card without being able to even
verify it properly is truly frightening.
