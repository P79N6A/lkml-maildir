Subject: I/O resource problem with ncr53c8xx init, kernel 2.3.14-pre1

hardware:
dual 200Mhz PPro with 256K L2 cache each
128M RAM
Intel PIIX3 chipset
ncr53c816 symbios-compatible SCSI controller
a pair of 2.1G Fireball harddrives
SCSI CD-ROM, 3com 3C905b e-net, Matrox VGA card
after building and booting 2.3.14-pre1 with a configuration similar to
2.3.1[02] kernels that were running more-or-less successfully on this box,
these messages appear on the console during system boot-up:
ncr53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 13, function 0
ncr53c8xx: disabling I/O mapping since base address 0 (0xe0804000)
           bits 0..1 indicate a non-IO mapping
ncr53c8xx: not initializing, both I/O and memory mappings disabled
then, of course, later on:
request_module[block-major-8]: Root fs not mounted
VFS: Cannot open root device 08:01
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:01
