http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/ericvh/v9fs.git;a=blob;f=net/9p/trans_fd.c;h=4507f744f44e527cc140b6b5601e556c10bfd361;hb=v9fs-devel

It has mysteriously gone away.  Perhaps it was triggered by some other
tree which was later fixed.

The algorithm to determine this is to look at the first line of -mm's
git-v9fs.patch:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.26-rc2/2.6.26-rc2-mm1/broken-out/git-v9fs.patch
has:
GIT 38bfbd9f766f0b33de6bc16fd9ad1018b8fd3fe2 git+ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ericvh/v9fs.git#v9fs-devel
Yes, -mm uses both linux-next and git-v9fs (aka #v9fs-devel)
linux-next uses #for-next and afacit that was empty as of a few hours
ago.  Nothing for 2.6.27?
