I'd like to point out that, while atomic_dec_call_if_* is really nice on 
i386, it is probably only good for i386 since no other architecture 
will be able to provide a better implementation than what can be done 
with atomic_dec_return() anyway.  Yet that IMHO overloaded 
atomic_dec_call_if_* stuff appears in core code.
But like for i386, those other architectures might be able to do some 
other tricks to achieve the same needed semantics.  My ARMv6 is one of 
them (and no it doesn't strictly follows the semantics of 
atomic_dec_call_if_*).  Are you willing to add more #if 
defined(CONFIG_MUTEX_FOO_ALGO) in the core code as time goes by?  I hope 
not.

I agree completely with you.  But what I don't want is core code 
needlessly restricting architecture specific implementation for short 
and well defined fast paths.  Maybe that's where we must agree upon: a 
well defined fast path helper for mutexes?
