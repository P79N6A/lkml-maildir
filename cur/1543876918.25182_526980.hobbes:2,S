Gene has confirmed that GNU tar figures it out as expected.

This commit is the one that changed it:

    [PATCH] register_blkdev(): don't hand out the LOCAL/EXPERIMENTAL majors
    As pointed out in 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7922,
 dynamic
    blockdev major allocation can hand out majors which LANANA has defined as
    being for local/experimental use.
I'm not sure I could argue for that to be reverted, so here's a possible
workaround for Fedora -- completely untested.
Add the following to /etc/modprobe.conf:
options dm_mod major=253
And make a new initrd for the problematic kernel. This assumes that
you're using device mapper as a module.
If you're building it in, then either dm.major=253 or dm_mod.major=253
should work on the kernel command line, but I'm not sure which it is.
