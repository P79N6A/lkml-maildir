Something strange I've noticed on all recent 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
If I start galeon whilst I've got a bk pull in operation, the
galeon process starts, opens its window, and then dies instantly.
Starting it a second time works.
Its not OOM, as theres plenty of free RAM, and half gig of free (unused) swap.
It's almost 100% reproducable here.  Only seen it do it on this box
though which is a P4 with HT, so it could be SMP related..
Ideas ?
