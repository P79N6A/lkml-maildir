Hmm... I don't think its broken, it's just not generic enough. If there was
a top-down design in a shape of a pyramid it would be more flexible. As it
is now, there are capabilities that are far too monolithic and cannot be
split just because they are one entitiy instead of a set of less capable
caps. Not to mention, that the linux-privs document documents several caps
that are not implemented in the kernel.

That's ok, imho. Capabilities in the kernel protect the kernel and its data
structures, what's in the user space should rely on ACLs that co-exist with
the in-kernel caps.

Hmm... these two aren't the kernel issue. For one, the "connect to X server"
isn't a general problem, but a specific one. You might demand the kernel to
have caps to restrict access to portmapper, smtp and whatnot. That's not the
kernel issue. As to /etc/passwd - it's not general as well. For kernel
/etc/passwd is just a file as thousands other files. If we had caps support
in the FS then you would fine-tune access to that file based on the
in-kernel caps, no need to provide any /etc/passwd - specific caps. Besides,
/etc/passwd is not the only form of the user database used - you can use the
NIS, LDAP, or GDBM databases - I'm sure you agree that having separate caps
for each of the cases wouldn't be a good idea... No, the access to the files
is user-space thing, and what I had in mind is protecting/giving access to
the in-kernel information.
