It looks good as a starting point :)
I just added mii_check_media() to drivers/net/mii.c.  It's in the latest 
2.5.x snapshot, 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/snapshots/patch-2.5.39-bk2.bz2
and is in Marcelo's inbox as well.  For simple implementations (and I 
think pcnet32 qualifies), the timer should not need to do anything 
beyond calling mii_check_media().  One important feature of this is use 
of the standard netif_carrier_{off,on} to indicate link to the system. 
netif_carrier_xxx also means you don't need lp->link...
