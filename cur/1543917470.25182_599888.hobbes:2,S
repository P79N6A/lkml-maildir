That is unfair.  Every time we discuss it I state that I disagree that
hiding mostly useful tests is a good thing.  I would love the tests to
be 100% accurate, but if I removed all the tests that can false positive
I would literally have none.  There is a balance to be struck and we
have significantly different ideas on where the balance is.

That is just stupid, I am no fundamentalist.  I personally care not what
tests there are or indeed if they are enabled by default.  I personally
feel you are more capable of turning off things you think are wrong, and
as such the default should be to offer all of the tests.  You disagree,
that doesn't make either of us fundamentalist.

Yes, but dispite that we don't just turn warnings off.  Even though they
produce false positives, as having them has some benefit.  My contention
is that checkpatch is following that same approach, risking some false
positives to try and catch problems.
Anyhow.  I have already added a --check/--no-check option which controls
the more subjective tests which will be in the next release; though its
likely the option name will be something more useful by then.
The only question is whether this should default to on.  You are voting
off.  I personally think on.
