Clarify things first.
PDC20267 is the Ultra100 core.
PDC20267 w/ a pull-up resistor reports its device class as RAID, Fasttrak100.
Now if you have a device that reports it storage class as RAID then it may
misbehave.  Otherwise, if it is reporting "Unknown Mass Storage" then you
have an Ultra/ATA controller.
There are two different BIOS cores for each design.
Linux cleanly supports the BIOS cores know as "Ultra" and not the ones
know as "Fasttrak".
Because there are different PCI config space setups for each core then we
have a problem unless we go and poke around for storage classes.
Does that help?
