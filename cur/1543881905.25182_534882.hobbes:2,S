My laptop goes nearly everywhere I do; I DO NOT want it on when I'm
travelling around to clients or between home and office or on a plane,
and I lose a lot of productivity the times I have to restart from a
cold boot as when I'm working I tend to have up ~10 xterms and while
my browsers have "restart", that's not infallible.
Any working suspend-to-disk method takes care of that for me.  (I'm
really not sure why Linus hates S2D so much, though. Back in the day
there was a lot more BIOS support, but that's been years now.)
