I'll accept that on face value, and take your comments five comments as
good pieces of information which I'll comment only briefly on.

"Idea on how to do things better" implies "well, gee, it wasn't done so
great to begin with" :-) which was kinda my point.  
By the way, if I sounded too serious, i'm having fun, otherwise I
wouldn't be wasting my time here.

The complexity may be somewhat less than you think.  If you break the OS
down into components, then take a look at any one of those compnents,
you can look at, study, and understand, and probably explain exactly
what any one of those components do at the code level (possibly even if
they are drivers for devices you are unfamiliar with).  Build up your
understanding of all of those little components, then you realize that
it's not as complex as you think.  The whole is just the sum of its
parts, and the parts are not that complex.

I've thought about concurrent access to hardware from multiple
processors, and didn't like it -- but that's where "Simple" (not
complex) concepts like spinlocks come in (call 'em mutexes or semaphores
or whatever your buzzword of choice is).  You wait for the resource to
become available then you access it.
As per buggy hardware, the software should _not_ have to support it. 
The software should report that the hardware has a bug and stop. 
Otherwise, you wind up writing really bad code for other hardware at the
same time that you're trying to work with one particular piece of bad
hardware.

You have the same tools, but they have different names.  For example,
instead of "printf" you have "printk", sure it's implemented in the
kernel itself, but it's there.  As per memory management, if you wanted
the kernel to do it for you, why the hell would you need to write a
kernel.

Yeah, kernel processes have access to all memory, while user programs
run in protected mode.  Among other things.  With responsibility comes
power they say, or was it the other way around :-)

It is equally naive to discard the possibility.  On the other hand, we
don't see the list of bugs that are fixed on a daily basis internally at
companies like microsoft.

There aren't any comparable systems for stability.

The enthusiastic enough part will be the tough part...  Why do something
which is already done?  If I can do it better, who am I trying to do it
for and why?  As they say "Code it first, then talk", well, I'm not
coding at this stage, so I guess I have no right to talk then.
