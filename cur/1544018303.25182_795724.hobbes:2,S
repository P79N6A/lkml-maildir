I didn't say it disabled it; the cpuset preference is actually implemented 
in the badness() score and not specifically excluded in 
select_bad_process().  That's because it's quite possible that a task has 
allocated memory in a cpuset and then either moved to a separate cpuset or 
had it's mems_allowed changed.
Please try it and you'll see.  Create two cpusets, cpuset A and cpuset B.  
Elevate cpuset A's oom.victim value and then trigger an oom in cpuset B.  
Your patch will cause a task from cpuset A to be killed for a cpuset B 
triggered oom which, more often than not, will not lead to future memory 
freeing.
It's quite possible that cpuset A would be preferred to be killed in a 
global unconstrained oom condition, however.  That's the only reason why 
one would elevate its oom.victim score to begin with.  But it doesn't work 
for cpuset-constrained ooms.
It's not going to help if it I explain it further and you don't try it out 
on your own.  Thanks.
