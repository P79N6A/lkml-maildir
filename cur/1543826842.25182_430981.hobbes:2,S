I already have a preliminary patch that allows the binding and unbinding
of fbcon which I sent to lkml and fbdev-devel.  Jon and Andrew are against
having the control in fbcon, so I'm  currently working on another patch that
will transfer the control to the console layer.  It was a bit more complicated
that what I thought, but I'm almost done. I'm just in  debugging mode, and so
far I haven't encountered any major problems.
The nice thing about this change is that it's not restricted to fbcon. Other
console drivers can explicitly bind or unbind, ie, your future drmcon.
I may send out the patch within a day or 2. After this, I'll start work on
the userland driver.
Tony
