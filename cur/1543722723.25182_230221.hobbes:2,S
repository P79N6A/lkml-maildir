Here is /proc/meminfo from a box that has all but exhausted its free memory:

Might as well suggest walking on water. The hardware is set in stone, this is
a software issue :^).
Something is preventing the cached memory to get reused, it's like it's gone
for good.
Is there any count of how often a cached block is accessed? If there is such
a count, and the count has an effect on whether to allow the release of the
cached block, that could explain this behaviour. Because it could turn out
that the cached blocks are accessed thousands of times.
Thanks--
