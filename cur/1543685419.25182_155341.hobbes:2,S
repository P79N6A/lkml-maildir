Lucky me, eh?
My CPUs *do* take microcode, and they are 933 MHz...
;-). I upgraded from a pair of 733 MHz CPUs bought in
July 2000, and my current BIOS just doesn't have any
microcode for them. Without the update, I used to come
back at the end of the day, switch on the KVM and be
unable to use the keyboard and mouse.
Anyway, I wasn't aware that Intel had released a
changelist for their microcode updates. Goodness knows
what bugs they're fixing.

My machine is currently hanging during boot-up (while
fscking the root partition, or releasing the "init"
memory), and CPU malfunction is the leading candidate
explanation. I have already replaced the 300W PSU with
a 400W one and tested the memory.

Yes, that's the "catch-22" bit. I was originally
thinking about either a bootstrapping floppy disk, or
maybe hacking some code into the boot-up sequence
itself.

OK, I'll look into that.
Cheers,
