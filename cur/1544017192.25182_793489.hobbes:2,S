This is a patch I also saw while trying to understand the problem with
Xen and UNEVICTABLE_LRU.  This patch is actually in the SuSE kernel and
claims to have something to do with kernel threads.
However for Xen, the problem is not a kernel threads, it's a regular
process thread (reiserfsck in to be specific, which mlockall's itself
into memory) and using this patch makes the null pointer deref Oops go
away, but still leaves scary messages in the log (a bunch of WARN_ON's).
I fail to understand why __get_user_pages of mlock'ed pages wants to go
into swap code, but then I'm not an expert in Linux mm.  Maybe this
happens because current->mm is already down and some code gets confused.
While googling around I found a comment that during mm teardown, the
kernel shall better not try to access user pages, I can't remember what
exactly it was about.
Cheers,
