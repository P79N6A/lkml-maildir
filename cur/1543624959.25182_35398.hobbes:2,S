Subject: Possible to unbind a raw devices so dvd can be ejected?

After using: raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hdc I no longer can eject the disk in 
/dev/hdc. (kernel version 2.4.19-pre7-ac2)
Using the eject utility I get "device busy" error, obvious as the raw 
binding has done a bd_get() on the /dev/hdc.
But now, how do I unbind it so bd_put is invoked? I don't see any way to do 
it and the raw ioctl doesn't see to offer that functionality either.
If there is no way this is extremely silly as I need to reboot to switch 
from one dvd to another.
I hope I am missing something...
If not is there a patch expanding the raw ioctl with unbind functionality 
and if not would one be accepted? I think that we definitely need one...
Best regards,
Anton
