If there were a wrapper around reads and writes of f_pos as there is
for i_size e.g. it would hit a lot of code, but not as many as I had
originally thought.  the most important ones are in the vfs itself, where
there are only 59 uses of the field (not all need to be changed).   ext3
has fewer (25), and cifs only 12 uses.
