Sure. It cuts round trips by a factor of 2. But that's just about all
it does.
Mercurial already does:
  - approximately O(log(new changesets)) requests/data to find new changesets
  - one request to get an entire changegroup (set of all new
    changesets), which comes back all nicely pipelined and sorted by file
  - delta transfer
In "dumb http" mode, ie what's been there since about day three, it
can do:
  - one request (size proportional to total number of changesets) to
    find new changesets
  - approximately two requests per changed file to pull all deltas
    (vs request per file revision)
  - delta transfer
