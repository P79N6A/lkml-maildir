We are gradually adding this to our web page, and what is not present 
there can be found by reading the source code which is quite readable 
for reiser4. Look in the node plugin, disk format plugin, and item 
plugin files/directories. These have some very long winded comments 
which are not yet on our web page.;-) green@namesys.com will send you a 
tarball of the source code if you ask for it.
