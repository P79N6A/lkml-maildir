   Talking about the b_sate reads (__buffer_state()), IMO it would be
   safer to change __buffer_state to use test_bit to avoid the
   compiler to cache the b_state variable in registers (b_state is not
   volatile).
This was specifically changed to not use test_bit so that the
compiler _can_ combine multiple bit tests into a single check.
Last I checked, all the places where multiple bit state checks are
done are safe and are guarded by other locking mechanisms already.
