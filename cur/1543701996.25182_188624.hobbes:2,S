Yes, partitions are not handled very well.
So far I have never seen udev discover partitions on its own.
I provoke it using "blockdev --rereadpt".
The result is that partitions appear in /proc/partitions and in /udev.
After removing the media another "blockdev --rereadpt" returns
"No such device or address" and the entry in /proc/partitions
disappears, but that in /udev stays.

Udev cannot do anything when there are no events.
And media insertion or removal does not always give events.
