Hello,
Running linux 2.6.23.1-21.fc7 
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
correctly reflects the cpu speed, when idle it is 996000 and when 
compiling it is 1826000.
Its also the same as what is in /proc/cpuinfo.
But with 2.6.23.8-34.fc7 
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
is always the max cpu speed of 1826000.
While cpuinfo_cur_freq is the max 1826000 /proc/cpuinfo relflects the 
correct speed when idle of
996000
This is on an asus laptop with an intel core 2 duo T5600 processor.
Anyone else see this problem.
Regards,
Steve
