Maybe I'm wrong.  kernbench is not some silly tight-loop microbenchmark. 
It is a "real" workload: gcc.
The thing about pagetable setup and teardown is that it tends to be called
in big lumps: for a while the process is establishing thousands of pages
and then later it is tearing down thousands.  So the cache-thrashing impact
of having those eighteen instances sprinkled around the place is less
than it would be if they were all being called randomly.  If you can believe
such waffle.
Kiran, do you still have the raw data available?  profiles and runtimes?
