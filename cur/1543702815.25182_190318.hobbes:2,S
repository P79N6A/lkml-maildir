That might definitely do it. offsetT (the type of values in gas) is 
defined as:
typedef bfd_signed_vma offsetT;
That DEFINITELY looks like the bit-size of bfd has an influence. In my 
program, offsetT is 64-bits -- looks like the default for Debian is 
--enable-64-bit-bfd. This explains why I didn't get a warning for my 
custom-built version, but I *did* get it for the version built by 
dpkg-buildpackage. Looks like we've got the final cause of the suddenly 
appearing warning.
