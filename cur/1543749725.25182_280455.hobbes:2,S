Hello Alex,
               The kernel modules are netfilter modules that i wrote
and want to be loaded as soon as eth0 is up. Is there any way in
kernel to add my modules and get it loaded at startup?
              I actually added in .bashrc but modules are loaded with
every console i open but not once in system.
regards,
linux_lover
