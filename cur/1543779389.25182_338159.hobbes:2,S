I've not tried 2.6.13-rc4 itself because i notice changes has been commited
into Linus git tree under id: 3d483f47579461a4715db33c68ef8752e5a97a2d
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=3d483f47579461a4715db33c68ef8752e5a97a2d
and this tree works well for me though previous one
[94d2ac66c12397e2ca7988dbf59f24a966d275cb] -- hangs. So i guess it is exactly
problem this patch solve.
Thank you and for your help.
