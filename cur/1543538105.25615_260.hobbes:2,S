Hi,

Because by the time glibc has been loaded, it's too late!  We need the
crt0.o stub to load libdl.so lower in memory or we have already
clobbered the address space irretrievably.  That's why Ben's proposal
for a per-process prctl() for the mmap base would seem to work well
--- you can just use floating mmaps and the kernel will automatically
place them somewhere that won't interfere with really large mallocs.

Good idea, but it doesn't help this problem.

That's what non-MAP_FIXED mmaps already do.  From mmap.c:
	/* Obtain the address to map to. we verify (or select) it and
ensure
	 * that it represents a valid section of the address space.
	 */
	if (flags & MAP_FIXED) {
		if (addr & ~PAGE_MASK)
			return -EINVAL;
	} else {
		addr = get_unmapped_area(addr, len);
		if (!addr)
			return -ENOMEM;
	}
get_unmapped_area looks for the next unmapped area above addr,
with the start address defaulting to TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE only if
addr==0 going in.
Cheers,
 Stephen
