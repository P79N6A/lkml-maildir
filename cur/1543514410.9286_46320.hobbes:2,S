Subject: Need static ppc bash for kernel port

Hello All,
    I am helping someone port Linux to an embedded PPC platform.  We have
gotten it to the point where it mounts its ramdisk at which point it dies
because it has no init or shell to run.  We are having some problems cross
compiling userland binaries, and I was wondering if anyone could mail me a
copy (or a link to a copy) of a statically linked PPC bash?
Thanks,
Jim
