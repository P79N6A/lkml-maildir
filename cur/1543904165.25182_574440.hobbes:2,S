Well, the admin wouldn't specifically ask for 50% of each CPU. He would
just allocate 50% of total CPU time---it's up to the scheduler to
fulfill that. If a task is entitled to one CPU, then it'll stay there
and have no migration. Migration occurs only if there's overload, in
which case I think you agree in your last email that the cache and TLB
impact is not an issue (at least in SMP).
