However, after a successful build, and installation of
module-init-tools-0.9.13-pre2.tar.bz2, I get the same errors from test3.
Kernel builds (and is running) fine, it's just the modules in the last error
message that refuse to build.

Ack! No, I missed those, I have updated and am retrying 'make modules &&
make modules_install' now.  Thanks!
