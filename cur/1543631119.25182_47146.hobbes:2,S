What about TCP/IP or USB? Okay USB is not only a protocol, but a lot of
hardware. But DCOM into the kernel would mean that a lot of people would
take care about it. The sourceforge project freedce looks nice, but to me
"as user" it's a bit tiny. 
If DCOM were wraped into the kernel, everyone could use it, as it would be a
part of the os itself. That makes it more interesting for companies who make
installations using DCOM to use Linux (also). And it would help us
firmware/hardware oriented programmers to use Embedded Linux in
infrastructures that are Microsoft dominated, because of MS propietaire
protocols like DCOM.
Just an idea, because we as company are right now dealing with that problem
that we use Embedded Linux for our measuring system, but will in future not
be able to connect to e.g. OPC, unlike we buy expensive licenses from
Software AG.
Hoping not to bother you with such.
Thank You.
Siegfried.
