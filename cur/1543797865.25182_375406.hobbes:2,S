The cast to long quiets a warning from gcc. Without the cast, it
complains:
$ make menuconfig
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/mconf.o
scripts/kconfig/mconf.c: In function `conf':
scripts/kconfig/mconf.c:699: warning: cast to pointer from integer of 
different size
  HOSTLD  scripts/kconfig/mconf
scripts/kconfig/mconf arch/x86_64/Kconfig
I like the changes, though -- menuconfig is much snappier and easier on
the eyes without the nasty flashing.
