You must not hold a spinlock across put_user - instead you must copy the
get_queued_event(user) into a local variable, spinunlock and then copy
it to userspace.
Compare drivers/sbus/char/sunkbd.c, function kbd_read from 2.2 and 2.4:
2.2.17 is bad, 2.4.0 is fixed.

I depends: there are exactly 2 safe uses for sleep_on(), all other
combinations can lock up:
1) The wake-up occurs from process context (neither bh nor interrupt),
and _both_ the thread that goes to sleep and the thread that wakes up
use lock_kernel().
2) If the wake-up occurs from interrupt context (only real interrupt or
bottom half, NOT from tasklet/softirq), then the thread that goes to
sleep must protect itself with the global cli lock.
wake_up_sleeper()
{
	new_data = 1;	
	wake_up(&wait_queue);
}
go_to_sleep()
{
	/* local interrupts must be enabled */
	cli();
	if(!new_data) {
		sleep_on(&wait_queue);
	}
	sti();
}
IIRC handle_event is called from interrupt context, thus a wake-up can
happen from within an interrupt, but there is no cli() before the
sleep_on() --> lock-up, even on UP possible.
But do not add cli() - remove sleep_on() and replace it with something
like wait_event_irq() [from include/linux/raid/md_k.h]
