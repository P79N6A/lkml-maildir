Yes, it will stop using it and if appropriate try and do a rebuild

Don't try and do "hot pluggable" IDE raid it really doesn't work out. With
scsi the impact of a sulking drive is minimal unless you get unlucky
(I have here a failed SCSI SCA drive that hangs the entire bus merely by
being present - I use it to terrify HA people 8))

Well placed concerns. I don't know what Andre thinks but IMHO spend the
extra $20 to put an extra highpoint controller in the machine for the third
IDE bus.
