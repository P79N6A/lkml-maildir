Joe, it's okay to have multiple "P:" entries for the same driver/subsystem
in MAINTAINERS (grep BLACKFIN ARCHITECTURE for an extreme example :-)
So you could probably do something like that here as well (but continue
to have a single "M:" entry), though as Alan mentions it isn't really good
to make different kind of changes in the same patch.
BTW bad, sad, things happened to my mailbox while I was away :-(
