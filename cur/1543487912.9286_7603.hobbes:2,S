Michael sent me the lis of oopsen for the second patch. All of them
are in the same place and it looks, uhm, interesting. Fragment in
question:
fs/proc/array.c::get_stat()
static int get_stat(int pid, char * buffer)
{
	struct task_struct *tsk;
	unsigned long vsize, eip, esp, wchan;
	long priority, nice;
	int tty_pgrp;
	sigset_t sigign, sigcatch;
	char state;
	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
	tsk = find_task_by_pid(pid);
	read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);	/* FIXME!! This should be done after the last use */
	if (!tsk)
		return 0;
	state = *get_task_state(tsk);
	vsize = eip = esp = 0;
	if (tsk->mm && tsk->mm != &init_mm) {
		struct vm_area_struct *vma = tsk->mm->mmap;
		while (vma) {
			vsize += vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start;
				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	At that point vma is 08010000. WIth obvious results.
Aside of our story - shouldn't we grab the semaphore on tsk->mm here?
ISTR that there were problems in proc/array.c. Andrea, could you comment
on that? I don't think that it's the cause of problem - it rather looks
like a result of earlier fandango on the core, but...
	Another thing: with the first patch (with additional 
s/max_files/2*max_files/) oops was pretty interesting - kfree_skbmem() had
passed bogus address (0xdcfa1600) to kfree() (Michael - my apologies,
initially I've misinterpreted it). It came from inet_recvmsg(). AFAICS in
unix_gc() we never mess with queues of AF_INET sockets, so it sounds, erm,
interesting.
	Michael, could you grep through your logs for EIP: and send me the
stuff around it (gzipped, if possible ;-)?
	Alan, you wrote about other reports - were they on l-k too? When
did it happen? I couldn't find them in archives ;-/
							Cheers,
								Al
