First, there is a known incompatibility between Linux 2.2.x & many ACPI
bioses.  The first thing I would check is to see if ACPI is enabled on your
750 & disabled on the 650.  For 2.2.x, you might try disabling ACPI in the
bios & see if this fixes the 64M limit.
Depending upon you situation, you might try the latest 2.3.x kernel.  There
are a number of improvements which the Athlon will be able to showcase.
Have you tried swapping the hard drives and/or controllers?  That is the
other variable I see.  If disabling ACPI does not fix the problem, I would
be VERY interested in knowning (offline) if the problem follows the HD or
controller, as it is possible that you are uncovering some sort of
compatibility issue--assuming you have tried a reinstall of the OS.

Subject: Memory/cpu problem with Asus K7M motherboard/Athlon 750
Hi there,
I've setup two servers with almost identical hardware, and identical
software. I've noticed a few problems which I haven't been able to
resolve. (if I'm not sending this to the right mailing list, please let me
know,
I've tried the comp.os.linux.hardware newsgroup, and nobody
has been able to answer my questions).
Server #1: 
AMD Athlon 750
Asus K7M motherboard
512 Megs of 3.3 volt ECC SDRAM
3COM 3c905 ethernet card
Slackware 7
Kernel 2.2.14
Seagate ULTRA WIDE SCSI 2 LVD 9 Gig Cheetah, 80megs/second
glibc 2.1.2
egcs
etc..
Server #2:
AMD Athlon 650
Asus K7M motherboard
512 Megs of 3.3 volt ECC SDRAM
3COM 3c905 ethernet card
Slackware 7
Kernel 2.2.14
Maxtor ATLAS 10k ULTRA WIDE SCSI 40megs/second
glibc 2.1.2
egcs
etc.
As you can see, these are basically identical setup except for the
CPU. First thing to point out, is that both mainboards are using the
same BIOS version. I have also tried to use an updated BIOS
from Asus (release 12/29/99) with the same results.
Server #1 detects 512 megs of ram on bootup (BIOS), but 
linux can only see 64 megs of ram unless I specify mem=512M
in the lilo configuration.
Server #2 detects 512 megs of ram on bootup, and linux
detects all the ram without extra parameters.
Server #1 is incredibly slow. Although it's got a faster processor and
a faster hard disk, it performs horribly compared to Server #2. Here's
an example of timing compilation of kernel 2.2.14 using:
time make bzImage
(after both kernels are configured identically and both servers are
idle with a load of 0.01)

Yes folks, the 750 was 16 minutes slower in compiling the kernel.
What's going on here? I haven't been able to figure it out. My guess
is that it's some kind of memory problem, but I'm completely baffled.
Any suggestions on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.
If you've encountered this problem before and know how to fix it,
please email.
