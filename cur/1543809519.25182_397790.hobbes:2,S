Is that the only thing which needs to be initialised early for SMP, or
are there other changes with early SMP init looming?
The reason I ask is that the cleanest solution for ARM would be to
introduce yet another initialisation function for MP platforms to
implement, which setup_arch() will call after the initial page tables
have been setup.  Hence, I'm wondering if the platform specific parts
could be simplified by moving more stuff earlier.
