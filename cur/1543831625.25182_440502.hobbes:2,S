Hello,
initial question was: Is there anything besides 64 bit migration going
into ext4?

this was actually a question (for which I didn't get an answer by now,
even if 34 people replied). I didn't want to start a stupid debate on
principials. However I am more interested in snapshots anyway. And if I
would provide patches, I would provide snapshot patches. - Which I
don't, because I am god damn busy at the moment.
