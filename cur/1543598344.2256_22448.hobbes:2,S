	  The following patch moves linux-2.4.9/drivers/block/DAC960.c
  to the new module_{init,exit} interface, simplifying it slightly and
  removing the DAC960_init reference from drivers/block/genhd.c
  (part of my effort to eliminate genhd.c).
I don't see any patch present as part of this message...
	  Leonard, does this look OK to you?  If so, do you want to
  submit this to Alan and Linus or do you want me to?
I have a new driver release alsmost ready, so I'll look your patch over and
merge it with my working copy, and then I'll send that update in.
		Leonard
