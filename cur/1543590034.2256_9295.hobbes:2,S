Thanks to everyone that has helped me with this problem (Netgear FA311
dies when apm.c's set_power_state() is called to unblank screen, for
instance when an X server exits or the monitor is awakened from
APM-induced sleep).  Since everyone has suggested work arounds, I'm going
to assume it isn't worthwhile digging any deeper for causes.
I've sent a two-line patch for the natsemi.c driver to the mainainers,
which simply re-disables power management before checking if there are any
packets to process in the receive buffer.  Turning off the APM screen
blanking option in the kernel also works.  My patch isn't in the 2.4.4
kernel -- perhaps the maintainers have a better idea than my hack, or are
hoping to find one =-) -- but if anybody wants this patch, my email
address should be valid at least until the 2.6.x kernels.
