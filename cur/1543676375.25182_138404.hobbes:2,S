so should i hold rtnl across add/remove atm addresses on atm dev's?
(but iw ouldnt hold rtnl across people just reading the list of
atm addresses right?)

ok, i was thinking i could use rtnl to protect readers.  this makes the
connect(dev = ANY) rather icky.  some of the abuse by me in other places
might be moot in the future.  i am planning (or have done) to move all
the vcc's onto a global list (ala many of the other protocol stacks).
this makes the code for proc (and others) much cleaner since you just grab
a read lock on the global vcc sklist instead of locking and interating
each atm device.  further, this will let atm interrupt handlers block
a race with vcc close/removal.  is this a bad plan?
