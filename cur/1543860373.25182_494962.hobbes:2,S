The patch looks totally bogus to me. It's passing a random struct device
from the hbsp host data structure to the dma_map_* routines. which they
can't do anything about.
The dma_map_* routines only know about some bus types. That's always
been the case (that's why you also can't pass a usb device's struct
device to them for example). Mostly, PCI, possibly others depending on
the platform.
So if you are to pass a struct device pointer to dma_map_*, use the one
inside the pci_dev of the host. Or have the host driver provide you with
the struct device pointer (which is the one from the pci_dev * for PCI
implementations, and others give you what they are on, assuming the
platform can do dma-* on that device).
Ben.
