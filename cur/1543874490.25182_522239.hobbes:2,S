Subject: [PATCH 3/5] AF_RXRPC: Make it possible to merely try to cancel timers and delayed work [try #3]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/20/283

Export try_to_del_timer_sync() for use by the RxRPC module.
Add a try_to_cancel_delayed_work() so that it is possible to merely attempt to
cancel a delayed work timer.
