I am trying to boot LFS6.0.1 livecd which has 2.6.8.1, but the kernel hangs
at:
Freeing unused kernel memory: 456k freed
My system is a pc/104 board based on ZFx86 with 64M ram
I also found this posting:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2004-03/5939.html
Looking at the console output, the cpu gets recognized as 486, whereas
2.4.22 detects the cpu as Cyrix Cx486DX4
Looking at the kernel source, it seems to get stuck after the call to
free_initmem and when I tried to specify init=/bin/sh it still got stuck at
the same place so I figured it doesn't even get to the run_init_process
calls in ..../init/main.c. Could the call to unlock_kernel get stuck?
