Nothing.  We've noticed the same thing.  It's a bug and was
first reported back in July, but no one has provided a fix yet.
I've had a brief look at the source code, but nothing obvious
pops out at me.
As you mention, this problem is trivially reproducable by
creating and then deleting a file.  Doing that over and over
eventually leads to the ramfs becoming full.  Only a reboot
(or perhaps a umount/mount) makes it usable again.
