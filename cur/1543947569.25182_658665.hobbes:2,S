It shouldn't matter how aggressively the repositories are packed or what
the binary differences are between the pack files are. git clone
should (with the --reference option) generate a new pack for you with
only the missing objects. If these objects are ~52 MiB then a lot has
been committed to the repository, but you're not going to be able to
get around a big download any other way.
