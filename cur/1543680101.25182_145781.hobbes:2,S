I was pulling my hair out (whats left of it) last week trying to get a Tyan 
2466 dual AMD 2800 MP (512 MB REGISTERED DDR, 3ware 7000-2 w/2 WD2000 drives 
and a WD800 IDE system drive, 2.4.21 Debian, ReiserFS) to run reliably under 
heavy disk and i/o (16 frame grabbers running a surveillance application).  
Eventually I would get "hda: missed interrupt .." and soon after ReiserFS 
file corruption.  I suspected memory and tried unbuffered DDR, and 4 
manufacturers of buffered DDR, all with the same results.  So I took pulled 
out the system drive, 3ware controllers and data drives, and frame grabbers 
and put them on a Intel P4/Intel motherboard, and everything booted and 
worked like a charm (though with more CPU load).  So I am wondering now if 
this file system corruption under heavy i/o load has something to do with SMP 
code?
