Ok today I have perhaps some more information:
I've copied around 30 GBs from FAT32 to ext3.
I diffed everything,.. differences in one file. I recopied that one
file, rebooted, diffed again differences in another file:
euler:~# diff -q -r /mnt/tmp/CDDA_DATA_1 /mnt/CDDA/EAC_DATA_1 Files
/mnt/tmp/CDDA_DATA_1/LOTR 1/16.01.wav and /mnt/CDDA/EAC_DATA_1/LOTR
1/16.01.wav differ
Than after the complete diff was finished I diffed the single file again
euler:~# diff /mnt/tmp/CDDA_DATA_1/LOTR\ 1/16.01.wav
/mnt/CDDA/EAC_DATA_1/LOTR\ 1/16.01.wav
=> then,.. no differences?!
Am I crazy or what?
Is this know an memory problem? But if so why does memtest give me no
errors?
Regards,
Chris,
