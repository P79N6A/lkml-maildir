The linux-usb-devel list has a slightly cleaned up version of Pavel's
Zaurus patch, which I've asked him to retest before this support
gets integrated.
These patches will apply to recent 2.4.20pre kernels too, if anyone
is sufficiently impatient to try... :)

Yes, but out of the www.handhelds.org box, not Sharp's box.
Zaurus doesn't have a stock www.handhelds.org kernel; there's a
different usb slave/target device driver, which uses different
framing for the Ethernet packets.  Pavel's patch teaches "usbnet"
about one of those protocols.  (The other is MSFT-friendly.)
It's worth mentioning the Yopy here too:  Zaurus isn't the only
SA-1110 based Linux PDA, and its distro is evidently closer to
the iPAQ distros (but you won't need a WinCE-ectomy).  Current
versions of "usbnet" have support for a recent YOPY version; they
use different USB vendor and product IDs "out of the box".
