Performing a loop block translation has always been able to invoke IO
to indirect blocks on the host fs --- it's just that traditionally
this has involved read, not write.  Read is actually the harder case
in some ways, because (a) it can never be deferred in the block buffer
cache, and (b) there is less protection against filling the whole
request table and deadlocking --- writes are throttled to occupy only
the first 2/3rds of the request table.
So, a great deal of deadlock protection is already in the loop support
for ll_rw_block.c.  You'll need to do more than hand-waving to
demonstrate that sparse loopbacks won't work!

Why?  2.2 should work fine over those devices.
