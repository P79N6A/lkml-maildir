The scenario you describe _is_ fixed by Ingo's patch, see below:
-----------------
in linux/kernel/sched.c - reschedule_idle_slow
        int this_cpu = smp_processor_id();
        struct task_struct *tsk;
-	tsk = current;
+       tsk = cpu_curr(this_cpu); 
        if (preemption_goodness(tsk, p, this_cpu) > 0)
                tsk->need_resched = 1;
-----------------
This eliminates the race and is a bug which should be fixed in 2.2.x.
