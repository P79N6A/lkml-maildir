Hi all,
A friend of mine recently triggered an error with and i830, using kernel 2.4.18.
The error was an 'Aaaaieeee', and it happened when X was killed and while 
playing some music files.
 
He is not subscribed to this list, so i just wanted to ask for him if there's
any known problem with i830 support and agp in recent 2.4 kernels and if it's
solved in 2.4.21.
Thanks in advance,
