Agreed, but the proposed change was to make ALL mounts be by volume
name, partition-name, or some indecipherable hex number stored in the
partition headers, and that idea is a non-starter as far as I'm
concerned.

Agreed, and I'm not worried about them as rebooting on my system is
for one of four reasons only:
 1. I've just moved house.
 2. There's been a power cut.
 3. Some hardware has been changed. This is rare.
 4. The kernel has been changed. This is rare, and usually for
    security reasons or because of (3).
In each case, I can spare the time.

If it's only at boot time, then it's not a problem.
Best wishes from Riley.
