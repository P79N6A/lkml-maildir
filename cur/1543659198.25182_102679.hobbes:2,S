That'll be a no then :) Ok I'm convinced. Please - no more replys!
I am interested what constitues a 'better mail client though'. I've been 
using mozilla mail, though laziness more than anything else. It gets the 
threads sorted *mostly*, but lots of loose ends seem to end up their own 
parents for some reason, and I haven't found a way of deleting a whole 
thread. Which mail client are the people in the know using?
