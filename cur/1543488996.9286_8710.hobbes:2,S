 Albert, now you are getting the picture here. I used to discuss the 
technical issues before, but that was because I thought I was taking part 
in a genuine techincal discussion. Unfortunately this proved not to be the 
case.
 Most of the people opposing DIPC have never even looked at the  
documentaion, much less the code itself. The problem is, they think they 
are wiser than the rest of us, and have this divine obligation to save 
the Linux kernel from bloating. 
 It is interesting to see the amount of energy they spend on keeping 
DIPC out of standard Linux kernel distributions. Unfortunately, most of 
this energy is used in "talking" than brain activity.
 Answering them is a privilege they don't deserve, and is hopeless anyway. 
 I guess Linus will be the ultimate judge here. I am hoping that DIPC will 
get into 2.3.x kernels when they start to come out. Maybe this way more 
people will actually see what it is, how it works, the effects it has on 
the kernel, and what kind of applications will benefit from it. That is 
becasue currently using DIPC requires patching the standard kernel, and 
many people are not comfortable with that.
