In the FWIW category, the collection of DOS packet drivers from Russ Nelson
(and the many commercial ones based on them) use a read of the NMI status
port to create a similar delay.  This code got used on lots of hardware
(although probably not much on current hw - mostly 386/486 type vintage
stuff I'd guess...)
I'm not advocating we move off 0x80 either - but people wanting to use
POST cards have at least a couple of options.  And if they have a POST
card, it is probably a safe bet that they can manage to apply one of
the patches and rebuild the kernel.
Paul.
