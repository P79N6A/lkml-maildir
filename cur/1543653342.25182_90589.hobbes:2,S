Took the card out, tried another, 10ec:8139 as expected.
Put the old card back in, didn't come up in BIOS or lspci.  Pulled the
card out, put it back in, comes up as 10ec:8139.
I suspect there's something flaky about this card :D
So yeah, ignore all the pci_id stuff, this card is just fubar :)
Man, I'd hate to be someone in charge of hardware under linux, there's so
much flaky stuff.
