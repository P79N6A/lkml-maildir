Subject: Re: [patch 2.6.24-rc6-mm 1/9] gpiolib: add drivers/gpio directory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: David Brownell <dbrownell@users.sourceforge.net>
Add an empty drivers/gpio directory for gpiolib infrastructure
and GPIO expanders.  It will be populated by later patches.
This won't be the only place to hold such gpio_chip code.  Many
external chips add a few GPIOs as secondary functionality (such
as MFD drivers) and platform code frequently needs to closely
integrate GPIO and IRQ support.
This is placed *early* in the build/link sequence since it's common
for other drivers to depend on GPIOs to do their work, so they must
be initialized early in the device_initcall() sequence.

Incorporates cleanup as suggested by Sam Ravnborg:  use HAVE_*
and a new idiom for adding "-DDEBUG".
