Subject: [PATCH 0/82] changing CONFIG_LOCALVERSION rebuilds too much, for no good reason.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following series of patches removes almost all inclusions
of linux/version.h. The 3 #defines are unused in most of the touched files.
A few drivers use the simple KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) macro, which is unfortunatly
in linux/version.h. This define moved to linux/utsname.h
There are also lots of #ifdef for long obsolete kernels, this will go as well.
quilt vi `find * -type f -name "*.[ch]"|xargs grep -El '(UTS_RELEASE|LINUX_VERSION_CODE|KERNEL_VERSION|linux/version.h)'|grep -Ev '(/(boot|coda|drm)/|~$)'`
search pattern:
/UTS_RELEASE|LINUX_VERSION_CODE|KERNEL_VERSION|linux/(utsname|version).h
PS: I hope my script is working ok.
