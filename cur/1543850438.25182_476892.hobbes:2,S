Sorry about my share of confusion introduced: Jiri Bohac
(jbohac@suse.cz) is currently working on a new timekeeping code for
x86-64 that takes a significantly different approach that allows for
precise and fast gettimeofday even on CPUs with unsynchronized TSCs.
This rewrite depends even less on hpet_use_timer than the current code.
The current code can cope with hpet_use_timer == 0, but that mode of
operation is far from optimal.

It doesn't seem right to me, unless someone at Sun really misread the
specification when designing the mainboard.
