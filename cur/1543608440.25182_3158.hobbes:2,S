That doesn't work.
The whole _point_ here is to make the thing variable-specific, so that we
can say _this_ spinlock needs a cache-line of its own, without blowing up
all spinlocks to 128 bytes.
There's no way we want 128-byte spinlocks in general. We want to mark 4-5
spinlocks as being so critical that they can have a cacheline of their
own. But I do _not_ want to have special operations for those spinlocks,
so I don't want those spinlocks to have any special types (ie the actual
_user_ should not need to care, so that you can play around with testing
the different spinlocks one by one without having to edit all the users of
any specific spinlock).
