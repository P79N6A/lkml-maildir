Yeah, bad patch management on my part, apologies, I should have pushed
it as soon as I noticed the problem.
Investigating the problem revealed some ugliness (and some races which
will need further work), and I had hoped to have a more complete fix
before now.  Oh well.
Two patches follow; the first does a very simple cleanup, the second
solves the immediate problem in the most straightforward way I can see,
but is a bit of a hack.
