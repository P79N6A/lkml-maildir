It's one of the ideas I had as well, except I would have expressed it:
int MODULE_OP(module_do_blah)(args)
{
	MODULE_RET(expression);
}
so that MODULE_OP and MODULE_RET would do the job of wrapping the
whole function in inc/dec (since our favorite language/compiler is
too braindamaged to do that in a nice way).  Updating all the module
code would be a massive effort, there are still holes open and it 
imposes needless execution overhead, compared to the solution Al's
preparing.  It would be better to stop wasting energy on such
fragile, clumsy low-level solutions and think about perfecting the
nice one that's on the table, or soon will be.
