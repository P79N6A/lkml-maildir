I could certainly use up another key ('z' is available for unfreeZe) but
I have the same question; under what conditions do you expect to need an
emergency sync and also need to maintain frozen filesystems as frozen?
From a maximum flexibility and control perspective, it'd be better to
have them separated I suppose.  Is it worth using up another available key?
