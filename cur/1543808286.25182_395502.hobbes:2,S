You have sharp eyes.
It doesn't matter much either way whether we increment or not here.
That's because this is in cpuset_init_early(), which is the -very- first
use of the global cpuset_mems_generation counter.  All other uses must
increment, so that they don't reuse a generation value someone else
used.  But we're first, so no possibility of reuse.
We can start with the first value, zero (0), or we can increment and
use one (1).
I changed it to atomic_inc_return() just to be consistent with all the
other locations that read this.  That way, if anyone else ever has to
get a value of cpuset_mems_generation and looks around to see how to do
it, they will see that it is always done using atomic_inc_return(), and
probably do it the same way, with minimum risk of confusion.
Just avoiding gratuitous differences in code that don't have a good
reason.
