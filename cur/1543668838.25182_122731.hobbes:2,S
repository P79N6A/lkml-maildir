I don't think I saw any. From memory there was temp info, power, on_die
and one or two other things (alarm maybe). This is from memory thoguh as
the kernel died during my compiling the kernel, mplayer and using
mozilla. Symptoms as before.
Current -bk10 kernel servived that.  Differences are:
+CONFIG_I2C=y
+CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV=y
+CONFIG_I2C_PIIX4=y
+CONFIG_SENSORS_ADM1021=y
+CONFIG_I2C_SENSOR=y

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
