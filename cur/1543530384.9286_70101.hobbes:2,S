Donald, that's not true, and you know it.
Neither I nor anybody else has expected you to maintain the drivers for
quite a long time now - you just didn't seem to have the interest, and a
lot of people have acknowledged that.  That is why there ARE new
maintainers for things like tulip and eepro100, whether you like it or
not. 
You did not lose influence of the drivers because you want to maintain
backwards compatibility. You lost influence over the drivers simply
because you never bothered to send in your changes. Don't start blaming
anybody else.
You were more interested in making sure your drivers worked with old
kernels that you were in making sure they worked with new ones. And now
you're surprised that they are only used with old kernels? I don't see why.
