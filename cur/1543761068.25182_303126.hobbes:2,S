Well, (a) the next rev of the patch will hopefully provide more access to the
second thermal probe than just detecting its existence (it still doesn't do
the sysfs or whatever magic to make the actual value accessible), and (b) the
probe I *know* about is on the CPU, and runs over 40C easily as well (it's sitting
at 49C right now).  Remember we're talking about a laptop here, there's not
a lot of room for a big heat sink in there.. ;)
