Hmmmm, getting rid of dummy would mean replacing it with capability.
- The differences between cap and dummy affect a relatively small
  subset of hooks
- If all of these hooks are implemented by all LSMs, we're done and
  can just remove dummy and replace it by capability.
- If not, we'd need to review for all of these LSMs, whether defaulting
  to capability rather than dummy could create a problem and whether 
  that can be addressed easily.
seclvl would probably need some changes, indeed.
root_plug could become shorter :-)

Sounds good!
