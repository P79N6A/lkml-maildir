Hi,
I'm part of EciAdsl USB ADSL modem driver developers
(
http://eciadsl.flashtux.org
)
I installed 2.6.7 kernel and I have some problems:
since I upload anything at max speed (15 kb/sec for me), I'm
disconnected after 2-5 sec with this USB error in /var/log/messages:
Jun 19 11:13:18 photon kernel: usb 1-2: bulk timeout on ep2out
Jun 19 11:13:18 photon kernel: usb 1-2: usbfs: USBDEVFS_BULK failed ep
0x2 len 1984 ret -110
No problem when I download sth.
I've tested with 2 machines (same problem), with these USB chipsets:
machine 1:
0000:00:07.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxxx UHCI USB
1.1 Controller (rev 10)
machine 2:
0000:00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB (ICH4) USB UHCI #1 (rev
03)
I tested with noapic option, same usb crash.
Many other people have same problem, maybe not for each upload, but lot
of disconnections with same error in logs..
Finally, I have no problem with 2.6.6 kernel or any older kernel (2.6 or
2.4): connection is very stable.
Feel free to ask me more for testing.
Thanks for any help.
I've not subscribed to LKML, so please CC me for any answer.
