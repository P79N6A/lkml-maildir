Thanks a lot !
Somehow I seem not have lost "most" linux-raid mails, dunno why...  I hadn't
seen that thread before, but it was indeed the problem I saw here too.
I didn't lose any data on the 2.4.7 that did this, but it seems the situation
is more severe in 2.4.9, leading potentially to significant data loss.
/me prepares another boot (and a spare 32MB stick) for the raid-1 box
