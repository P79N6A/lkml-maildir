It's actually worthwhile protecting a lot of shell settings
like that.  The bash `noclobber' option also breaks a
significant number of shell scripts, including those that
start X.
# Interactive options
if tty -s
then
 # History
 export history_control=ignoredups
 export command_oriented_history
 # Don't `bash' files with `pipe' :-)
 set -o noclobber
 # Pretty ls
 alias lls='/bin/ls -lakpA --color=tty'
 # cd looks about filesystem and environment before failing
 export CDPATH=".:~"
 export cdable_vars
 # Don't complete to backup or binary files
 export FIGNORE="~:.bak:.o"
 # Sometimes we want to come back
 alias pd=pushd
 alias ppd=popd
fi
