Ummm. I could just be wrong, but since I'm setting structure elements to
equal the functions before they are declared, I need the fwds (unless,
of course I put the "struct timer_opts timer_pit" section below all the
functions, which is doable).  Also, since external functions are going
to be calling these functions via the structure's function pointers, I
believe they can't be static. Although, maybe they can, as long as the
timer_pit value isn't static. I'm not that much of a C guru, so I'm
really sure.

They could be, but I'm not sure about the necessity. Is this a coding
style sorta' thing, or a C properness sort of thing? Either way is fine,
I just don't follow the logic.

Thanks for the feedback, I'll probably go ahead and apply your
suggestions, although, I'm still quite ignorant as to the reasons for
doing so. If you could, please fill me in.
thanks
