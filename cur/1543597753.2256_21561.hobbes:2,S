Hi Linus,
thanks for your comments.

Maybe that's the difference of whether you define the kernel behaviour by
deciding what goes in and the one that tries to avoid a breakage without
changing the default behaviour ...
Of course the sysctl is less intrusive (from a user's point of view).

PS2 mouses need this ping thing to be operational after being plugged.
But, there's no reason it needs to be done in the kernel.
* It works for plain PS2 only (not: imps2, synps2, ...)
* The userspace driver (gpm, X11) can do it as well, AFAICS
I guess the thing has been introduced because it was more convenient than
fixing userspace.
Maybe the kernel does it a bit more efficient by throwing away the queue ...

I'd be happy with removing it.
Patch will follow!

A few sysctls don't qualify as overdesign yet, I hope.
