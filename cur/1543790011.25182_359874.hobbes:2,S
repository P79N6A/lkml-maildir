	Inaky Perez-Gonzalez   has a wonderful suite of performance, stress and
functionality tests for the fusyn pthreads mutex package.
	I've been able to use this test suite to measure robust futex 
performance with very little
change.  The posix test suite compiles cleanly against the nptl header 
files and libararies,
which is very good news.   It means we got the header files and 
libraries right.
	The following are three  graphs on the pthread mutex ownership change 
latency test
for all three flavors of kernel,  PREEMPT_NONE,  PREEMPT_DESKTOP and 
PREEMPT_RT,
using the realtime preemption patch-2.6.14-rc5-rt5.   The 
ownership_change_latency
test ran unchanged, modulo changing the clock-id for the real time 
clock in the run script.
	The graphs are just to show relative performance for the different 
flavor kernels.  The
kernel's perform quite closely regardless of the 'flavor' of kernel.  
The kernels have quite a few
debugging options turned so I can look for any problems so performance 
is not optimal.
	It appears the robust futex functionality is healthy in all flavors of 
kernel.
