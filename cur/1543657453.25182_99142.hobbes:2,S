Hi Jörg,
	My config is A1 OK !

# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_TIMES is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_LOG is not set

	As I said, you NEED the ifdef in sysrq.c. Look again.
	Re: scx200 - OK, I had sorted that one myself.
	Re: comx
	Sorry - procfs is configured. Don't know what's going on here.
