Personally, I'm amazed that professional developers have to discuss or
defend modular, portable code.
Once the code has been submitted, then specific implementation problems
can be dealt with.

That is absolutely correct.  In addition to portability between kernel
versions and operating systems, there is also portability between
user-mode and kernel-mode within a single release.

I think their point is that they want the core device driver code to be 
portable across kernel versions, and across different OS's other than 
linux--which basically requires some kind of abstraction layer.
