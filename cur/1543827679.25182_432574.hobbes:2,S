No its not in Linus tree and has even more overhead than the existing 
counters since it always checks if a certain counters is on or off and it 
also does indirect calls to an update function.
It does not use local_t at all and takes an smp_processor_id() parameter 
to various functions which makes the future use of cpu_local_* functions 
not possible (should that implementation get fixed).

The light weight counter implementation here provides the output of 
/proc/vmstat. That is a fixed interface.
