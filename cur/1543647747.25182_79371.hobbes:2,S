Load is an exponential average, recalculated according to this formula
(see CALC_LOAD in sched.h) every five seconds:
  load1 = load1 * exp + n * (1 - exp)
where exp = 1/exp(5sec/1min) ~= 1884/2048 ~= 0.92
      n = the number of running tasks at the moment
To jump from 0.21 to 27.65 in 5 second (1 update), n would have to be
343.  Wow.  (Substituting the numbers for 5 and 15 minute averages I get
n of about 362 and 352).
Can somebody check my math?
