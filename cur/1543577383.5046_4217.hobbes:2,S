What experience ?  Only real-time latency testing or SMP scalability 
testing? 
The case I was thinking about is a heavily contended lock like the
inode semaphore of a file that is used by several threads on several
CPUs in parallel or the mm semaphore of a often faulted shared mm. 
It's not an option to convert them to a spinlock, but often the delays
are short enough that a short spin could make sense.
