If only for the fact that it allows you to don't look at archaic
hardware configuration options makes it a good idea I think.
Bus is bus if we have CONFIG_PCI, we should have CONFIG_ISA as well.

Plase add mcd and mcdx - CD-ROM drivers. Both of them required
an special "controller" card, which was indeed ISA based.
