yes, this seems the better option. generally, the more complex rules you
have, the more people tend to break it (either through not being able t
comprehend it or cos it's too difficult to follow).
i believe, the doc here is pretty unambiguous regarding the fact that
volatile should be avoided. And as Stefan pointed out, anyone who feels
the need to use, must surely _know_ what he is doing & hence is in a
position t make that decision (followed ofcourse with a doc of why it
was done).
it would be better we didn't grow the list of exceptions - IMHO.
