Yes, the FPGA is a pci device.
Not sure I follow exactly what you mean by the fact that platform  
devices dont know about mmio regions.  They know about struct  
resource and iomem_resource & ioport_resource.
I think I might be missing something fundamental here.  In  
implementing my own bus_type, I'll end up introducing my own struct  
foobar_device which looked pretty much like struct platform_device.
Then I'll need a set of functions to assign resources, etc.
I got no issue implementing my own bus_type, but I clearly feel like  
I'm missing something here (just not sure what it is :)
