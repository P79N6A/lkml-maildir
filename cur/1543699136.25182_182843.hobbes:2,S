For this sort of case it seems like it would be much cleaner to have
some sort of proxy device that would load the module upon open -- so the
also drivers would end up creating both alsa entries in /dev, and also
proxy entries for the supported oss devices.  
That way, you could have the explicit device entry (which I think is all
around saner), but not the overhead of rarely used modules.
