Yes, I thought of that just after I sent out my email. In the case that
you mention, the utime and stime accounting is incorrect anyway :-)
I think we need to find a better solution. I was going to propose that
we round correctly in (the divisions in)
1. task_utime()
2. clock_t_to_cputime()
I suspect we'll need to round task_utime() to p->utime if the value of
task_utime() < p->utime and the same thing for task_stime(). I've tried
reproducing the problem on my UML setup without any success. Let me
try and grab an x86 box.

Yes, very interesting observation.
