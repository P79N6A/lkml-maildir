On low end boxes the benchmarks I did show later 2.4-rmap beats 2.2. 2.0
worked suprisingly well (better than pre-rmap 2.4) and as Stephen
claimed the best code was about 2.1.100, 2.2 then dropped badly from
that point.
Low memory is of course where rmap does best, so the 2.4-rmap v 2.4
parts of such testing are not actually that useful
