Thanks Erik for that useful suggestion.

Since we already have Linux Kernel 2.4 based drivers for all the other
devices present on our ARM 920TDMI based chipset which we cannot
change. The SATA driver which I'm going to write has to be based on
Kernel 2.4.25. Through backported patches I have to make Kernel 2.4.25
to support our new SATA driver and as well our existing device
drivers.
Please do let me now if you have any suggestions in this regard.
Thanks:-),
Deven
