Well, the report said 'Intel BX chipset' - that's as solid as chipsets get
(to loosely quote Alan). Almost all of my boxes are BX (one has HPT366 in
addition, and another one was changed to Via686a recently), and I imagine
that BX gets most testing since it is very common chipset. Moreover, it only
does UDMA33, not any fancy 66 or 100 stuff (although I haven't had problems
with those either on HPT366, HPT370 nor 686a).
As said, it could be the ide patch, but surely there are other just as
likely suspects as well.
