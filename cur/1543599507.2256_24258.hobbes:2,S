kmalloc(,GFP_NOIO) failure.  i.e. transient out-of-phyical-memory
condition. 
I suspect that kmalloc tends to fail only occasionally as the failure
will then to slow allocation requests down, and give the VM system a
bit of time to write more stuff out to disc and so free up memory.  
I am fairly sure that without the patch it will happen again, but
maybe not straight away.
