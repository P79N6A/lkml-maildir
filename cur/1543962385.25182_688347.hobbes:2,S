Hello,
While shutting down 2.6.25 on my VIA EK8000, just before turning off the
encrypted swap, I noticed messages about a circular locking dependency
rolling over the screen. The messages were not in /var/log/messages
after reboot.
The machine did shut down and restart without further problems.
I assume a serial console is the only way to capture the error messages
of this circular locking dependency.
Or are there alternatice methods?
Is this specific circular locking dependency a known issue?
Kind regards,
Udo
