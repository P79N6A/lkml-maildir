I agree. However, I still think we should do my suggested
"wake_up_new(p,clone_flags)" thing, and then have the logic on whether to 
try to care about threading or not be in schedule.c, not in kernel/fork.c.
The fact is, fork.c shouldn't try to make scheduling decisions. But it 
could inform the scheduler about the new process, and THAT can then make 
the decisions.
