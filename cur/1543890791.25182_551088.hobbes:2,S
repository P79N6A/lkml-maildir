I can see that - but I think it should be at least be brought up for each
warning, to determine either:
1) if it should be ignored
2) if a signed type is actually intended
3) if the code should be elided
While not necessarily in the IB instances, there are cases where there
are entire blocks of code (with debugging output, error returns, etc)
that can never get run, and it may make sense to remove those.
