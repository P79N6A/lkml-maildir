Noting that many of the emails with Linux-Kernel in the CC list use
either 'CC:' or 'cc:' rather than the 'Cc:' that your extract quotes,
I would hope the manpage to be slightly out of date in that regard.
Unfortunately, procmail specifications ARE case sensitive...

I have to admit that I wasnae aware of that macro, but in my case, I
now use the '^Sender:' line to detect what should go where, as I'm on
several mailing lists that regularly get cross-postings and prefer to
separate them and have a copy in each relevant folder - I keep several
archives of the various folders for perusal when I'm less rushed...
Best wishes from Riley.
