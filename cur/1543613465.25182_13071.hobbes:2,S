Well there is a thinko or two above, but provided we have a variant of
request_module that only returns zero when it actually loads a module,
this should only loop once or twice:
 do {
   /* search for protocol, set protoptr. */
 } while (protoptr == NULL && request_module("proto-%u",protonum)==0);

I think the deeper problem is that request_module is expensive. If, say,
it had a fast path on the order of an inline hash lookup on a cookie
corresponding to the module identifier, we could just unconditionally
request_module(cookie).
Cookie here might be also something like a dentry, which can be positive
or negative, and has some of the reference counting and locking semantics
we need for modules anyway.
