Oh, virtualspace footprint of IO areas is far worse, as the convention
is to direct map them into a single address space if they're ever used.
Of course this convention is much more loosely established than e.g.
struct page is for RAM. Some analogue of kmap_atomic() for such
machines to multiplex virtualspace in interrupt context would help, but
is unrelated to physical address passing issues.
