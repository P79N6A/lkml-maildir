The way that "ilog2" is defined this should be really  
straightforward, I dunno why those functions seem so
overly complicated:
   roundup_pow_of_two(x) := 1 << ilog2(2*x - 1)
   rounddown_pow_of_two(x) := 1 << ilog2(x)
Where ilog2(x) simply returns the first bit set in the word:
   ilog2(0) => undefined or -1 or something
   ilog2(1) => 0
   ilog2(2) => 1
   ilog2(3) => 1
   ilog2(4) => 2
   [...]
The results:
   roundup_pow_of_two(1) = 1    rounddown_pow_of_two(1) = 1
   roundup_pow_of_two(2) = 2    rounddown_pow_of_two(2) = 2
   roundup_pow_of_two(3) = 4    rounddown_pow_of_two(3) = 2
   roundup_pow_of_two(4) = 4    rounddown_pow_of_two(4) = 4
   roundup_pow_of_two(5) = 8    rounddown_pow_of_two(5) = 4
   [...]
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
