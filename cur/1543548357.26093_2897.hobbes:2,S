Yep, and I have seen it too.  (Though not to BSD.)
People would rather switch OSes than apply a patch
which Alan won't accept.
The very fact that a large and important patch by
(as far as I can see) the NFS _maintainers_ is not
being accepted by the stable kernel maintainer does
not fill one with hope about the quality of the patch.
