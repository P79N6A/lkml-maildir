Subject: [PATCH] rpc: fix garbage in printk in svc_tcp_accept()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/20/359

we upgraded the kernel of a nfs-server from 2.6.17.11 to 2.6.22.6. Since
then we get the message
lockd: too many open TCP sockets, consider increasing the number of nfsd threads
lockd: last TCP connect from ^\\236^\É^D
These random characters in the second line are caused by a bug in
svc_tcp_accept.
(Note: there are two previous __svc_print_addr(sin, buf, sizeof(buf))
calls in this function, either of which would initialize buf correctly;
but both are inside "if"'s and are not necessarily executed.  This is
less obvious in the second case, which is inside a dprintk(), which is a
macro which expands to an if statement.)

We're printk'ing random uninitialized memory here, which I assume makes
it appropriate for both 2.6.23 and 2.6.22.x.--b.
