The primary reason it's not 4KSTACKS already is that I run multiple XFS 
partitions on top of an md RAID 1. LVM isn't involved, however, and I'm not 
using any other filesystem overlays like dm.
I'm fairly sceptical that it's a stack overflow, but I'll be sure to enable 
the debugging option on the next try.

Well, GCC 3.4 kernels seem to run fine with it, but as I said to Linus I'll be 
sure to turn this and the sound drivers off in the next build.
