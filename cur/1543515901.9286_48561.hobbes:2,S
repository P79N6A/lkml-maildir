;-) Irrelevant, since proc_scsi_* is no more. Kinda silly to leave externs
after that... I removed the remaining externs of that kind, but there may
be other problems with drivers/scsi stuff - patch was large and there was
no way to compile them all afterwards (to start with, quite a few are
architecture-specific). So there may be dragons.
