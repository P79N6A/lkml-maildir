I'm surprised - perhaps the Knoppix distribution did not have SMP enabled
itself, but installed a config with CONFIG_SMP?  Or you built more recent
kernel sources (2.4.19 defaults to HT on) than the Knoppix distribution
(vanilla 2.4.18 defaults to HT off)?
It would be awkward for me to try CONFIG_M386 on our P4 Xeon, but I did
just try building a CONFIG_M586 CONFIG_SMP kernel for it, which behaved
as I expected: /proc/cpuinfo showed 4 cpus, but only 2 cpus when booted
with "noht".
