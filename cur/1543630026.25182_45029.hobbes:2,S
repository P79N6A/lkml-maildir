Interesting domain name.

I've just re-reviewed the 2.4.16 -> 2.4.18 diffs.  There's really
nothing there which could explain this.  We have:
- lots of s/bread/sb_bread/etc.  Which is rather unfortunate because
  it complicates any attempt to back out to 2.4.16's ext3.
- A bug fix for locking journal buffers (the infamous "request_list
  destroyed" bug)
- Some error-path-only code which remounts the fs readonly rather than taking
  down the machine when the unexpected happens.

I'd be suspecting this, frankly.   Might be an IDE failure.
