Yeah.  All can fall back to  PS/2 mouse emulation mode.  But to enable
the extended features,  you need to write to the  port to enable them,
and then interpret the extended data formats.

It's easier to write a mouse  driver in userspace than in kernel.  But
with the  input system  in 2.6, I  am *forced*  to write it  in kernel
space, and  reboot and  reboot and reboot  when it oops.   Writing the
driver in kernel  space, I at most get a segfault.   Plus I cannot use
everything from glibc.  It simply  takes more time and energy to write
a kernel space driver.
    Vojtech> Your psaux/userspace serio driver is fine, except it
    Vojtech> cannot coexist with the other drivers.
That's why I've abandoned it.  It's obsolete.
Our (Tuukka and I) SERIO_USERDEV  patch does work with kernel drivers,
and allow  both kernel  and userland drivers  to coexist.   Again, I'm
disappointed that you still haven't discovered this.
Now, it's time  for you to try our SERIO_USERDEV  patch, plus my crude
userspace atkbd.c and psmouse drivers.
    Vojtech> Anyway, at least 99% setups just keep working in 2.6.
But  not 100%  compatibly.   Mouse  moving twice  as  fast, mouse  not
accelerating, etc.  And  tp4d not working any more.   And touch screen
not working. ...

It depends on  what level I want  to analyze at.  How come  you have a
crystal ball telling you that you know what I want?

No.  The kernel has already translated the data.
