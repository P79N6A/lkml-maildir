Ok, we should fix that. We should just make it look like all other stack 
frames.
There is other code in the kernel that "knows" that all kernel stacks have 
the fields for the user stack return on it, namely the ptrace code etc. 
Now, the initial stack is hopefully never *accessed* by that kind of code, 
but this kind of special-case code is just wrong.

Well, we might as well then just make the code readable instead. IOW, how 
about this one, which just declares a structure that describes the stack 
frame thing? That just makes everything clearer, since we can then use 
"sizeof(that structure)" instead of using the magic "2*sizeof(unsigned 
long)".
