Different in what way?

If they're static and unreferenced then the linker will remove them.  Of
course, usually humans remove these because they generate warnings, unless
special-things happen.  We deliberately do special-things with
register_cpu_notifier() so the notifier-block and the handler go away if
!CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU.
If the functions are non-static then yes, I expect we end up with them in
vmlinux.  There are tricks we can play with -ffunction-sections to fix
that, but we don't.
