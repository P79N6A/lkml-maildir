If you want to test that stuff and run it on the current code in the 
kernel, how about a kernel module? You could "modprobe sanitytest" or 
something and report to syslog at module load time. And maybe have a 
parameter which does something drastic if something core is so hosed 
that filesystem damage is likely. Or just optional init code run by a 
kernel option, perhaps sanity testing after boot is not a great idea.
