Ok, I now use the following command:
       dd if=/dev/full of=/dev/sd?1 bs=4M count=4883
Here the results for all 8 disks in parallel:
       /dev/sdc1 24.957257 MB/s
       /dev/sdd1 25.290177 MB/s
       /dev/sde1 25.046711 MB/s
       /dev/sdf1 26.369777 MB/s
       /dev/sdg1 24.080695 MB/s
       /dev/sdh1 25.008803 MB/s
       /dev/sdi1 24.202202 MB/s
       /dev/sdj1 24.712840 MB/s
A little bit faster but not much.
