Without CONFIG_HOTPLUG and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI, I got this:
   CC      drivers/pci/pci-driver.o
drivers/pci/pci-driver.c: In function `pci_match_device':
drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:156: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:156: warning: type defaults to `int' in declaration of `type name'
drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:156: error: request for member `node' in something not a structure or union
drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:156: warning: type defaults to `int' in declaration of `__mptr'
drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:156: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
[snipped similar errors/warnings]
make[2]: *** [drivers/pci/pci-driver.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/pci] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
Setting CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI=y allowed 2.6.13-rc2 to build/boot/run.
