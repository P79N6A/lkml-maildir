Sorry, I should have been clearer. I do not own any VIA SATA hardware 
(that info was relayed from a Gentoo bug report). My own hardware is 
older, [Apollo KT266/A/333]. The quirk gets applied to my IDE controller 
only (both before and after Chris's changes), and I boot from a disk 
connected to this IDE controller.

When I said I removed the quirk, I meant I removed the whole quirk, 
which prevented it from running on my hardware.

Assuming you mean "quirk IDE", no.
> Do you need quirk with ACPI enabled ? 
No. But, my interrupts are always XT-PIC, I cannot enable IO-APIC (not 
sure how much relevance that has, possibly worth noting though).
Just for clarity, I'll respond to those 2 questions again with Aiko 
Barz's system in mind (the user on the Gentoo bug report) -- this is the 
one with the VIA SATA hardware.

No.

Yes.
