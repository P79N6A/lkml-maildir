Sort of related..
We already have FPU emulation in kernel, and there
exists a project to emulate MMX/3dnow!/EMMX instructions
at 
http://www-sop.inria.fr/prisme/personnel/pion/progs/mmx-emu/
Would there be any benefit if such a project were integrated
into the kernel? Other than allowing 386's to run MMX apps
without needing a recompile. :-)
regards,
Dave.
