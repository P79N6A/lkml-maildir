I don't think the two interfaces will be broken if somebody kexec 4
kernels. For example, when kexec D from C, the /proc/vmcore is contents
of B, /proc/kimgcore is contents of D. To jump back from C to B, the D
is unloaded, and a jump back helper image is loaded.

Maybe it is not sufficient to only show the previous kernel's memory
contents. In kernel C, you maybe need to access the memory image of
kernel B and memory image of kernel D.
That is, /proc/vmcore is the memory image of the previous kernel,
and /proc/kimgcore is the memory image of the next kernel.
