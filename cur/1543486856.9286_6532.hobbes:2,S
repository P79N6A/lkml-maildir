thanks, Claude.
I stopped backporting to 2.0 about 2.1.117
I am currently doing a COMPLETE from-scratch (ok, I looked at the old stuff
:)
 rewrite for 2.2 (2.3?)  and when it is stable, I will backport it to
 2.0.3x or whatever is most recent - in full.  I am adding some new
 features, simplifying code a lot, and hopefully adding wrappers for some
 new compatibility.
 There was an issue on 2.0 - it seemed to break modules!  I never looked
 into very far, though.
 I'll hold on to this cleaned up patch, and make sure my 2.0 (when I get
 there) complies with your changes.
 Thanks.
 p.s. Claude - I'll try to have version 0.6a available for tests Real Soon
 Now (tm)
