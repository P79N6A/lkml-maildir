It may be hardware specific for our board, but my thought is that any device should be
able to take advantage of the cs_chg_udelay regardless of which write function it uses.
As far as I can see, there is no where else to make a clean change to allow devices that
use the "normal" write function the ability to take advantage of cs_chg_udelay.
