Subject: CRTSCTS wrong in man tcsetattr

Man tcsetattr in gentoo implicitly states that after
#include <termios.h>
#include <unistd.h>
CRTSCTS constant will be defined. This is however false:
tty.c:38: error: `CRTSCTS' undeclared (first use in this function)
CRTSCTS is defined in bits/termios.h and in asm/termbits.h The question
is what is the correct state of affairs?
1) the manpage should say bits/termios.h instead of termios.h
2) the manpage should say asm/termbits.h instead of termios.h
3) the termios.h should include bits/termios.h or asm/termbits.h
4) the manpage should not mention CRTSCTS at all
