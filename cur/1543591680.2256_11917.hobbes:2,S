Ok. What do you think about reorg like this:
basically leave the old code as is, and add
        if (is_pyxis)
                alpha_mv.mv_pci_tbi = cia_pci_tbi_try2;
        else
                tbia test
                ...

21174 docs confirm that (though in a very low voice ;-) :
 "The 21174 may hang with TBIA=3."
It hangs with TBIA=2 as well. I was able to reproduce it reliably
on sx164 with direct windows disabled just by copying 10-20 Mb via 3c905b
card -- this driver allocates/frees pci buffers at a very high
rate, so "tbia" occurs pretty often.
The fix itself took 2 days of hacking and 50+ reboots...

Right... I noticed these deleted lines only after posting the patch.
