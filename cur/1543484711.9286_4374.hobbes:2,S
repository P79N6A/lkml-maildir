This mkdep.c little-endian problem really itched me, so I scratched it.
I wrote a patch to mkdep.c that blows away the architecture-sensitive
LE_MACHINE stuff and has a simple implementation of GET_NEXT.
I'm aware that a lot of people here run 'make dep' a lot and they care
about speed.  So I ran a speed test.
My simple version is ten percent *faster* on my processor, and eight
percent *faster* on my ISP's processor.
Now personally I think it's wrong to put architecture-sensitive tests
into mkdep.c in the first place.  It's a freaking kbuild program, not
the system call entry sequence.  The only justification for a complex
implementation is speed.  But it turns out the complex implementation is
*slower* by actual measurement.  It's slower because it has more branches.
So let's kill it already.  Patch appended.  Try it out; let me know
if it works for you.

How I tested: I started with linux kernel 2.2.2-pre2.  I went into
drivers/char and did 'wc *.[hcS]' to load all the files into the disk
cache.  Then I ran these commands five times:
    time scripts/old-mkdep *.[hcS] > .depend	# old mkdep
    time scripts/mkdep *.[hcS] > .depend	# simple GET_NEXT mkdep
My machine is an IBM 486/SLC-2-66 MHz, 16 megabytes memory, 14 bogomips.
I use gcc version 2.7.2.
Here are the timing figures:
    /* old mkdep */
    2.04user 0.79system 0:02.85elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
    2.07user 0.79system 0:02.88elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k

    2.05user 0.82system 0:02.89elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
    /* simple GET_NEXT mkdep */
    1.75user 0.76system 0:02.52elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
    1.76user 0.77system 0:02.54elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
    1.78user 0.74system 0:02.53elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
    1.75user 0.75system 0:02.52elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
    1.77user 0.74system 0:02.52elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
I looked carefully at the generated code for GET_NEXT (the important
invocation in the inner loop).  Here's the code:
    /* old mkdep */
    .L104:
	    shrl $8,%ebx
	    testl $3,%esi
	    jne .L105
	    cmpl %edi,%esi
	    jae .L102
	    movl (%esi),%ebx
    .L105:
	    incl %esi
    /* simple GET_NEXT mkdep */
    .L104:
	    cmpl %edi,%ebx
	    jae .L102
	    movb (%ebx),%cl
	    incl %ebx
The old mkdep takes an extra conditional jump.  My processor doesn't have
branch prediction, so the 'jne .L105' causes a pipeline stall.  This jump
is not a compiler artifact; it comes about because the fancy GETNEXT needs
to have a test on each character to see if it's at the end of the word.
I also tried hand-tuning the inner loop of the old mkdep to make the
common case be an untaken conditional branch.  No joy; the performance
did not get any better.  The code still has to take an out-of-line branch
every sizeof(unsigned long) characters.
I repeated these tests on my ISP, which has a GenuineIntel 686 Model 5
with 300 bogomips.  The gap was about the same; average 0.66 seconds
(over a bigger set of files) versus 0.61 seconds.
I don't have access to any non-i386 machines to test performance there,
so if someone would like to do head-to-head performance measurements,
go for it.  Post the numbers and the details.
