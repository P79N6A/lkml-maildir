I think the problem is the changes that were made
in 2.5.x to htb_next_rb_node().  It used to be:
static void htb_next_rb_node(rb_node_t **n)
{
        rb_node_t *p;
        if ((*n)->rb_right) {
                /* child at right. use it or its leftmost ancestor */
                *n = (*n)->rb_right;
                while ((*n)->rb_left)
                        *n = (*n)->rb_left;
                return;
        }
        while ((p = (*n)->rb_parent) != NULL) {
                /* if we've arrived from left child then we have next node */
                if (p->rb_left == *n) break;
                *n = p;
        }
        *n = p;
}
But it was changed into:
static void htb_next_rb_node(struct rb_node **n)
{
        *n = rb_next(*n);
}
This is wrong, the new code has much different side effects
than the original code.
This looks like the problem, devik what do you think?
