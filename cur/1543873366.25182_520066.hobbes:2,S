sched_clock is used to bank real time against some specific states
inside the scheduler, and no it doesn't _just_ measure a processes
executing time.

The hypervisor would need to do it's own accounting I'd imagine then
provide that to the scheduler.

True, but as I said in my original email it's not trivial to follow
physical cpu speed changes since the changes are free form and change
potentially per system. Your better off do it just with the hypervisor
since you can control it ..
