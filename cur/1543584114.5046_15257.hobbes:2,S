uhci.o will cause crashes eventually.  It doesn't work with the visor
driver, sorry.  Stick with usb-uhci is you use the visor USB driver.
I just tried -ac14, with all of the usb subsystem as modules, and
everything worked fine syncing data, and installing packages on my
visor.
I'll try to run with everything compiled into the kernel later tonight.
Does -ac14 with all of USB as modules, using usb-uhci work for you?
thanks,
