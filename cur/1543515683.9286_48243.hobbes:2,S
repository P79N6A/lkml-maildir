You're kidding, right?!
This is definitely *not* kernel stuff.  fsck is the same complexity no
matter where it lives, and it is complex enough that it has nothing to
do in the kernel.
"A specially written program" *IS* a driver.  The fsck driver for a
filesystem (fsck.<fsname>) belongs in user space.
Backup/restore, however, is another issue.  There is a standard
interface for that... it's called "the filesystem".  It has been
argued that one thing that a backup utility would need that isn't
cleanly provided is a root-only open() flag to not set atime.  (There
has been talks about adding hacks backup/restore of non-Unix
filesystems, but those hacks are inherently filesystem specific
anyway.)
