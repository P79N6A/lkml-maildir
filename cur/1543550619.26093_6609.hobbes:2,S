EBCDIC code: Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code - a platypus
if there ever was one.
  Code - I thought I already knew that
  Interchange - So there's a code that doesn't?
  Decimal - Great, support those Lixie tubes
  Coded - See 'Code'
  Binary - No, you're *kidding*
  Extended - Wow, BCD is great!  Let's make it even better!
People have ten fingers to count on; computers have two and that's why
we have conversion routines.  The concept took a little while to sink in
with some people.
