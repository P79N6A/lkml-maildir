Hello
I've got an MSI P35 motherboard with
4 SATAs ports via ICH9R southbridge chipset and 1 SATA and IDE via
Marvell 88SE6121
In bios, It's possible to set ICH9 in  RAID, AHCI or IDE mode but  not
Marvell chipset
I've applied the patch bellow against a 2.6.20 kernel
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=116808637400504&w=2
In dmesg I've got this kind of line
ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0xE807
I've got a 320Gb HD and  DVD burner plugged on the IDE connector.
Does anyone  know how can solve this ?
Normally I should use a 2.6.22 kernel to have support for hardware
monitoring  and cpucore driver.
Regards
