Adding a 10 byte header will cause all subsequent 64bit values to be
misaligned unless necessary padding is inserted between the values or
the file is read to a buffer that is aligned so that the 64bit data
entries align properly. Anyway, screwing this up can (will?) cause
performance problems on 64bit architectures.
I would think a better way to solve this is to look for an impossible
value combination of the first (couple of) 32/64bit entries and use that
as a magic marker for the new format. Using a text-based format is
probably out of the question for performance reasons.
