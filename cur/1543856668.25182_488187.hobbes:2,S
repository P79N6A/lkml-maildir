well, I fear that we will have lot of overhead
'sneaking' in via small patches (with almost
unnoticeable overhead) making the 2.6 branch slower
and slower (regarding networking) so IMHO a complete
solution should be drafted, and tested performance
wise, we can then adjust it and possibley improve
it, untill it shows no measureable overhead ...
but IMHO it should be developed 'outside' the kernel,
in small and reviewable pieces which are constantly
updated to match the recent kernels ... something
like stacked git or quilt ...

hmm, I think a good mix of netperf, netpipe and
iperf would be a good start, probably network folks
know better tests to exercise the stack ... at least
I hope so ...
of course, a good explanation _why_ this or that
code path does not add overhead here or there is
nice to have too ...
