In a previous post I incorrectly stated that my serial port is a
TI16750, as this is what /proc/tty/... revealed to me.  After
re-reading the product manual, I see that this is actually a 16550. 
Since Linux is seeing this port as a 16750, could that explain why I'm
seeing missing characters in the transmission.  After doing some
research, I found that the 16750 has a 64-byte buffer, whereas I know
this to only have a 16-byte buffer.
If my assumptions are correct and Linux is detecting this serial port
incorrectly, how can I force the serial driver to see this a 16550?
Thanks again for any assistance you can provide,
Andy Kennedy
