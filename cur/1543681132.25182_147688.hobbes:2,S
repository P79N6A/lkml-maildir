NO!  Not just like free().  The documentation for free() explicitly states 
that NULL pointers are valid input and result in no action.  A 
release()-type function, by contrast, is called back from core system code 
that guarantees it will always pass a pointer to the currently-registered 
owner of the corresponding resource.  If the owner were NULL, the 
release() function wouldn't have been called in the first place.
