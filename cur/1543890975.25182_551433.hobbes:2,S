Your numbers do not match mines (mines were more than two years old so I redid a test before replying)
I tried your bench and found two problems :
- You scan half of the bitmap
- You incorrectlty divide best_delta and worst_delta by LOOPS (5)
Try to close not a 'middle fd', but a really low one (10 for example), and latencie is doubled.
with a corrected bench; cache-cold numbers are > 100 us on this Intel Pentium-M
num_fds: 1000000, best cost: 120.00 us, worst cost: 131.00 us
On an Opteron x86_64 machine, results are better :)
num_fds: 1000000, best cost: 28.00 us, worst cost: 106.00 us
