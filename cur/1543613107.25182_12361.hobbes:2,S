	Hello,
	I have (maybe HW) problem w/ my USB mouse. From time to time,
the kernel thinks it was disconnected and then reconnected again,
altough nobody touched the cables.
It would be OK, but there is a problem: after the reconnect, it become
active as /dev/input/mouse1 instead of /dev/input/mouse0, and my
X server cannot (of course) find it.
	The system is RH7.2, kernel 2.4.16, Athlon 850 (ABIT KT7).
Here is the dmesg output of the USB after boot:
usb.c: registered new driver usbdevfs
usb.c: registered new driver hub

hub.c: USB new device connect on bus2/2, assigned device number 3
input1: USB HID v1.10 Keyboard [Chicony USB Keyboard] on usb2:3.0
	And the disconnect/reconnect looks like this:
usb.c: USB disconnect on device 2
hub.c: USB new device connect on bus2/1, assigned device number 4
input0: USB HID v1.00 Mouse [KYE Systems Genius USB Wheel Mouse   ] on usb2:4.0
	Where the disconnect/reconnect come from, and why the mouse
changes its device number?
