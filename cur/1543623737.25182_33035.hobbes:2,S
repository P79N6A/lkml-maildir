Subject: linux-2.5.6-pre3 calls release_kernel_lock without holding lock

	When I boot an SMP linux-2.5.6-pre3 on a uniprocessor x86, I
consistently get a kernel panic at boot when the release_kernel_lock()
call at line 760 of kernel/sched.c apparently attempts to release
its kernel lock without holding it.  I believe that this happens
when the kernel makes the first thread, but I'm not sure.
	2.5.6-pre2 did not have this problem.
	Just to rule out one thought that some of you may have about this,
I should mention that I am aware that the stock kernel now runs the
child of a fork() first (at least according to the comments in
kernel/fork.c), and I removed my run-child-first code some time ago.
So, that change is not the cause of this problem.
	I will post a follow-up if I am able to diagnose this problem,
but I think I'm going to sleep now, so I thought I ought to mention this.
