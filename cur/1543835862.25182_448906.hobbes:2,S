planning sometimes is not possible, exspecially in certain highly stressed 
environment.
Just think. I had 3 years ago a database that was 2 TB, we were supposing 
it could grow in three years of 6 TB, but now it is 40 TB because
the market situation is changed, and with this the number of the users and 
their needs.
Please you have to suppose that when you 
have to deal with filesystems use for some kind of services, it is 
impossible to predict the grown rate, and this is true also about the 
numeber of used i-nodes.
