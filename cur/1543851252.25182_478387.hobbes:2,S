This was using the recommendation of "each process belongs to a single 
container that can be attached to controller nodes later."  So while it is 
indeed possible for the controllers, whatever they are, to be hierarchical 
(and most assuredly should be), what is the objection against grouping 
processes in single-level containers?  The only difference is that now 
when we assign processes to specific controllers with their attributes set 
as we desire, we are assigning a container (or group) processes instead of 
individual ones.
