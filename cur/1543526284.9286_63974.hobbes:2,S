End users don't always get it. They often aren't computing people. If they
turn off the TV or pull the plug out of the wall the TV doesnt break. You
need to think outside the computing mindset - not even neccessarily into
brightness either - someone can be very bright and utterly incapable of
relating to computers. 
At the same time - the fix is hardware, the PC isnt fixable for this the
CD-ROM drives are. The 2.2.x supermount stuff does that bit right
