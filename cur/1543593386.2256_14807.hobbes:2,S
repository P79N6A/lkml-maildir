Please note the following discrepancy between RH70 and the minimal required
versions
of the following 3 packages (I am ommitting others, like pci or reiserfs
stuff, as these
seem irrelevant to your case. See Docu*/Changes on 2.4.5 for details)
package	RH7.0 has...	2.4.2 and on needs...
util-linux	2.10m		2.10o
modutils	2.3.21		2.4.2
e2fsprogs	1.18		1.19
HTH,
