So far I haven't tried it from X.  Most of my test machines don't have
video.  When working on a good machine you should be able to return
the video to the state you got it.
I'm not quite certain how to handle the crash dump case.

A command line work work.  You can arbitrary segments so you can pass
anything that is needed from the user space side.

A serial console is my usual test case, so that shouldn't affect
anything.  I'm glad that it worked. 
For the speed difference my hunch is perhaps you didn't specify your
normal kernel command line on the command line.  
Usually I do something like:
kexec bzImage root=xxx console=ttyS0,9600 blah, blah, blah.
Mostly kexec is supposed to be the simple test client instead of a
full fledged interface.
