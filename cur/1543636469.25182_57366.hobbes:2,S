Before I start asking what about XXX, is there a list of what major stuff
is already considered to be in? I don't see some things on your list,
perhaps you regard them as done.

I really hope these do get in!

	I fear Keith might go SPC if this had to wait for 2.7

	I thought these were all progressing nicely

	Definitely want to stabilize these
> o UDF Write support for CD-R/RW (packet writing)  (Jens Axboe, Peter Osterlund)
	Hopefully this is close as well
> o Full compliance with IPv6                       (Alexey Kuznetzov, Jun Murai, Yoshifuji Hideaki, USAGI team)
	could ease in 2.6.x if not?
> o Add support for NFS v4                          (NFS v4 team)
	This really shouldn't wait for 2.8!
> o Remove the 2TB block device limit               (Peter Chubb)
	This would help db folks now, and who knows how big
	a single drive will be before 2.7?
> o Overhaul PCMCIA support                         (David Woodhouse, David Hinds)
	Sure would be nice if it worked on desktops as well as laptops

I sure would like to see documentation improvements on this list! For 2.6
it would be beautiful is no features went into /proc/sys unless they went
into the Documentation directory as well.
