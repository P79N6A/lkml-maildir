I've now updated the BIOS to the latest version available on Asus' site. The 
crash occurs even earlier - during bootup this time. Exactly:
CPU2: Machine Check Exception: 000.0004
CPU3: Machine Check Exception: 000.0004
Bank 0: a20000008c010400Bank0: a20000008c010400
Kernel Panic: CPU context corrupt
In idle task - not syncing
Again, disabling hyperthreading allows the system to operate normally.
