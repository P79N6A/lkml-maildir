Okay, few things to keep in mind:
*) cut-copy-paste is bad. If you fix error in one copy, it is _very_
easy not to fix it in other copies.
*) void *'s and casts are bad. They hide real errors. If you have 
struct foo {} bar;
and want 
bar * baz;
later;
You can write it as struct foo * baz. That will make type checks
actually work and save you lot of casts. 
*) hungarian notation is considered evil in kernel.
struct bla_s {} bla_t;
*is* evil -- why have two types when one is enough? In kernel land,
right way is to do 
struct bla {};
and then use "struct bla" everywhere you'd use bla_t. It might be
slightly longer, but it helps you with casts (above) and everyone can
see what is going on.
