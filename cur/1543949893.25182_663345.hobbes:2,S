[1.] new NUDAM (USB-485) converter not recogniced by pl2303. Little change
required.
[2.] Until now NUDAM USB to RS-485/422 RS232 converter was detected by USB
system and pl2303 module working fine in my Debian as /dev/ttyUSB0
# dmesg
....
usb 5-1.3: new full speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 17
usb 5-1.3: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
pl2303 5-1.3:1.0: pl2303 converter detected
usb 5-1.3: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0
# lsusb
Bus 005 Device 017: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port
 They changed USB ID and now its like:
# lsusb
Bus 005 Device 016: ID 0b63:6530 ADLink Technology, Inc.
but this ID is not detected by PD2303 module.
a little change in pl2303 solve the problem

[5.] not required
[6.] not required
[7.] not required
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
I made the tribial changes in:
drivers/usb/serial/pl2303.c
drivers/usb/serial/pl2303.h
adding de new USB ID 0b63:6530 to the existing arrays as needed
recompile kernel, etc,etc.
and it works fine again.
Please include this in newer versions if it is possible.
