(Note that the ixp2000 doesn't have NPEs.)
(Both the 2000 and the 23xx have microengines, which are both
supported by arch/arm/common/uengine.c.)

The ixp23xx NPEs seem pretty much identical to me to the ixp4xx
NPEs.  There are some minor differences between the ixp2000 and
ixp23xx uengines, but those are easy enough to deal with.

Sure, ixp23xx hardware is harder to get.  I'm not sure what you mean
by 'independent' users, though.  Are people with non-42x hardware
'dependent' users, and why?

I'd say that it's up to those who are interested in ixp23xx support
(probably only myself at this point) to add ixp23xx support.
