Hello,
I recently upgraded to 2.6.10 and tried (today) to burn a dvd with 
growisofs.
It seems there is a problem
Here is the output
# growisofs -Z /dev/scd0 -R -J ~/foobar
WARNING: /dev/scd0 already carries isofs!
About to execute 'mkisofs -R -J /root/sendmail.mc | builtin_dd 
of=/dev/scd0 obs=32k seek=0'
INFO:ingISO-8859-15 character encoding detected by locale settings.
        Assuming ISO-8859-15 encoded filenames on source filesystem,
        use -input-charset to override.
Total translation table size: 0

/dev/scd0: "Current Write Speed" is 4.1x1385KBps.
:-[ WRITE@LBA=0h failed with SK=4h/ASC=08h/ACQ=03h]: Input/output error
:-( write failed: Input/output error
Needless to say it works fine with 2.6.9
Am I missing something?
Thanks
Laurent
