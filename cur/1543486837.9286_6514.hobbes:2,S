The easy solution is to return the drive and buy a different one. You can get a seagate hornet for the same price. The media is cheaper and it works under Linux.
Gadi worked on mine for a while and decided it has broken firmware or some other problem. It gives strange error message while trying to read the filemarks. It died for me after about 6 mb. Sony tech support refuses to answer the phone. I played phone tag for 2 weeks trying to getr specs to write the driver to no avail.
