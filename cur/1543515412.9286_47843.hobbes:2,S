Did anything regarding this authentication change from 2.3.9 to 
2.3.10? I did not modify my PPP parameters and so I am wondering why 
it is not working anymore.

I though it is the other way round -- and it was like that before: The 
NT machine authenticated my Linux box. But I will try it out with the 
noauth parameter.
