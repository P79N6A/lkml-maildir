It would seem to me that this would be vastly more useful in the real 
world if there were a settable default, so that administrators could 
avoid having to find and tune individual user processes. And it would 
seem far less common that the admin would want to set the limit *up* for 
a given process, and it's likely to be one known to the admin, at least 
by name.
Of course if you want to do the effort to make it fully tunable, it 
could have a default by UID or GID. Usful on machines shared by students 
or managers.
