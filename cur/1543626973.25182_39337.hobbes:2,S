Using "strace getconf _NPROCESSORS_CONF" it tells me, that glibc is also
parsing /proc/cpuinfo.
BTW: there are _NPROCESSORS_CONF and _NPROCESSORS_ONLN, works for me:
3ecki@calista:~> getconf _NPROCESSORS_CONF
1
3ecki@calista:~> getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN
1
ecki@SeeDeBrCVS:~$ getconf _NPROCESSORS_CONF
2
ecki@SeeDeBrCVS:~$ getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN
2
