You are arguably obtaining services by deception, and possibly also
violating a content management system.
However the MODULE_LICENSE isn't aimed at people like that. In fact I've had
totally positive responses from people who ship well known binary modules
and understand why we want them to get bugs related to their code.
The people bright enough to hack insmod generally are also bright enough to
realise why its a bad idea.
