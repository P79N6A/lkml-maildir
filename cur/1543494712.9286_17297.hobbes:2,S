This is a classical optimization: In 99 out of 100 cases, the "child"
will perform an "exec" in a few milliseconds. The possibility is there
that that will require disk IO. At that time the parent will get the
chance to do its thingy: run on until the "wait" system call (about 98
percent of the cases...)
