2.1.133-5 fails to compile if CONFIG_BSD_DISKLABEL is enabled; it
tries to look for BSD_PARTITION, which doesn't exist; this looks like
it should be FREEBSD_PARTITION *or* NETBSD_PARTITION, or perhaps
BSDI_PARTIION.
Since I don't know BSD at all I don't know how to fix this, but it
should either be fixed or the option taken out.
