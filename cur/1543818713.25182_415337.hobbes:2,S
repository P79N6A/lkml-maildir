great detective work! I've increased it to 512K in my tree, to be on the 
safe side. I'm not sure which parameter takes so much per-cpu space.  
There's certainly no problem with your config, this must be something 
caused by the -rt tree. The -rt tree introduces a new per-cpu concept 
(called PER_CPU_LOCKED) which is used in a couple of cases, but it 
shouldnt cause this drastic increase of the per-cpu area's size. Weird.
