I think it should be easy with such card, though I think the drivers
can't currently do that.

I think the hardware would permit that. Probably needs additional
driver support and I'm not sure about timeslot synchronization (for
HDLC, sync doesn't matter).

Not sure, maybe yes (less data to bridge due to bit stuffing, flags etc.),
maybe not (variable length of HDLC frame).

I think the above could be a problem - I think common T1/E1 cards
can do only one stream at once.
I wonder if it can be done in software - the hardware framer would
have to pass all data transparently, and it would be demultiplexed,
processed and then multiplexed by the driver. Quite complicated,
but I think at 2 Mbps it wouldn't be a CPU performance problem.

Easy even with existing drivers I think (no bridge support but it's
trivial).
