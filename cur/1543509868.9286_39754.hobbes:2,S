OK. Both disks are now using DMA. I have applied the very recent TEKRAM
Flash Upgrade (which got it working) and then applied Mr. Hedrick's IDE
patches to 2.2.12. Basically, here is the output - it's still a little
crap and I'd like to go faster. My motherboard has a UDMA33 controller,
so surely the transfer rate could be twice what it is below?
I have given 3 readings for each disk so that it isn't just a "one off":
OLDER DISK:
[root@periscope mastersj]# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.34 seconds =95.52 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.51 seconds =11.62 MB/sec
[root@periscope mastersj]# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.42 seconds =90.14 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.26 seconds =12.17 MB/sec
[root@periscope mastersj]# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.40 seconds =91.43 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.31 seconds =12.05 MB/sec
NEWER DISK:
[root@periscope mastersj]# hdparm -tT /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.44 seconds =88.89 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.27 seconds =14.99 MB/sec
[root@periscope mastersj]# hdparm -tT /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.47 seconds =87.07 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.32 seconds =14.81 MB/sec
[root@periscope mastersj]# hdparm -tT /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.44 seconds =88.89 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.28 seconds =14.95 MB/sec
Thanx,
