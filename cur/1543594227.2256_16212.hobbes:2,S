Yeah, it's occurred to me, but it's yet to happen.  I fought with the thing 
for 48 hours, and after settling on a K6 kernel w/'Enhanced' enabled, I've 
not had a single problem.  I suppose it's possible that I've not seen the 
problem, but I've put this box through it's paces many times over since I 
settled.  I gave it another go with 2.4.6-pre3 this morning, hoping something 
had snuck in ;)
