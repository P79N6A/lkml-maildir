There were already several long flamewars^Wdiscussions about reiser4 on 
linux-kernel.
There has already been some amount of press articles covering reiser4.
But how much usage is the result of this?
There seem to be the the following possibilities how users get reiser4 
into their kernel today:
1. -mm kernel
2. non -mm kernel
   a) patch downloaded from namesys.com
   b) through their distribution
      - in a kernel image
      - as patch
   c) patch forwarded through other channels
2b) seems to be the only number that is easily measurable.
Do you have some download statistics for namesys.com?
Multiplying the downloads for the 2.6.16 patches with 10 seems to be the 
best estimate for the order of magnitude of current reiser4 users that 
seems to be available.
