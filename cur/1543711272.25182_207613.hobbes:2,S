Well, we already have time source selection in 2.6 for i386. Most other
arches have a single stable time source, so its not as critical for
them. As for 2.7, a couple of holes have been poked in my initial
design, so any major rewrite is somewhat on hold. Moving more arches to
the more generic time_interpolator interface that ia64 uses may be the
best solution, although its not as clean as I'd really like.
