the ALSA part looks fine for me.
and it looks now much much cleaner.  thanks!
well, very subtle things:
for sound-service-?-1 and sound-service-?-8, only 0 is available,
and other numbers don't exist.
so, the definition in sound/core/seq/oss/seq_oss.c can be like
MODULE_ALIAS("sound-service-0-" __stringify(SNDRV_MINOR_OSS_SEQUENCER));
MODULE_ALIAS("sound-service-0-" __stringify(SNDRV_MINOR_OSS_MUSIC));
but it's harmless to use MODULE_ALIAS_SNDRV_MINOR() as you did... :)
