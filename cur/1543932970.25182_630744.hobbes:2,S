Good catch.  Indeed, what's missing is one line:
	i->num = num;
Of course, an arch-specific version of this could merge between sg_rings,
too, but that's an optimization.

Rusty.

Obvious counterpart to dma_map_sg.  Note that this is arch-independent
code; sg_rings are backwards compatible with simple sg arrays.
