Call me paranoid, but until such controller drivers can withstand
loads placed by filesystems I have a hard time trusting them!  ;)
Various drivers using smaller transfers (control for LCD or audio DAC,
sensors, EEPROM access) have also been reported to work.

And answering a question we had:  I did get confirmation from one person,
saying that they'd used a previous version of this driver on at91rm9200
with success.
I think that answers Andrew Victor's basic question about whether the
"legacy" at91 SPI driver is ready to go away ... the main unresolved
issue being a replacement for that old userspace interface.  (And that
issue is nearly resolved too.)

So this should follow the merge of the AVR32 architecture updates, and
the AT91 GPIO patch, to prevent creation of configs that won't build.
ISTR that AT91 also needs some arch updates to make it _run_ properly
(to use the same board init conventions), but IMO this can merge before
those if that simplifies the process.  (That is, no need to wait for
AT91 patches to go from Andrew to Russell to Linus first.)
Thanks for making this driver happen!
