Hi all,
I am the maintainer of the page about the Toshiba Portege R100, 
(
http://www.freed.net/opensource/R100.html
).
Tried booting 2.6test1, and the screen and keyboard go incomminicado. 
This also happened with recent 2.5s. The boot procedure completes OK, 
and so I can talk with the machine over the net, but as a laptop that 
does not get me very far....
Thanks, please CC me as I am not on the kernel list.
Sam
