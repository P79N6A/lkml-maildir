I disagree with this.  We only have one reporter of a problem and it
appears to be some type of obscure interaction with pktdvd which no-one
can track down (although it's not really helped by the reporter not
being very responsive).
The correct thing to do is root cause the problem and fix it at source,
since it's very likely that this is a pre-existing bug that was simply
uncovered by the patch you're recommending we revert.
Unfortunately, I suspect it won't get fixed until someone else actually
manages to reproduce it (which I haven't been able to so far).
