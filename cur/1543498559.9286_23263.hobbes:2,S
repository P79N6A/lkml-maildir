No need to worry, "squid" doesn't block anything, its admin does; it's
just the function to do that is more visible; admins are more
"paranoid"; maybe Felix assumed the default acl to deny CONNECT-ing to
random ports also involves restricting http GET, it's not, since it's
not directly as dangerous.
I've put the word paranoid in quotes because the people who do something
like that do things like blocking any ICMP traffic too, and that's not
called paranoia...
