I didn't run neither make-clean nor make-kpkg clean, and however,
version.h is not here, even just after the compilation of the kernel.
And, to compile my modules successfully, I copied version.h from vanilla
to /usr/src/2.6.4-mm2/include/linux (and modified it the correct way).
Then I compiled my modules, and after that, my hand-made version.h is
still here, so make-kpkg doesn't delete anything.
=> version.h is _never_ created.
Thank you for your help.
