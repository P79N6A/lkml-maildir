So I gues that it won't be hard to lockup 2.2.0 just causing the number of
freeable pages to go to 0. Did somebody tried to go OOM with 2.2.0 yet?
Here I can cause nr_freeable_pages to go to 0 pretty easily (and that
happens just a bit before to get 1 process killed). I hope that 2.2.0 VM
will behave differently.
