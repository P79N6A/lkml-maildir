That is true, good spotting. Only adding a "volatile" in not the right
solution. The point here is that the stsch inline assembly can write to
pgm_check_occured. We better tell the compiler, e.g. by adding a
"memory" clobber or better a "+m" (pgm_check_occured). For the later
we'd have to copy the inline assembly though.
