And measure the number of cycles a gigahertz CPU can do between a 1ms timer.
And then check how often the typical application executes something like
gettimeofday.

It's also all interrupts, not only syscalls, and also context switch if you
want to be accurate.
On modern PC hardware it might be possible to do user/system accounting using
performance MSRs. They have a bit in the performance counter that allows to
only account user or system. If you find a count that is near equivalent to
the cycles you have both: total = rdtsc, user = msr, system = rdtsc-msr.
At least PPro derived have event 0x16, number of instructions executed, which
might be good enough when multiplied with a factor if your instruction mix is not 
too unusual.
Still even with that the more complex checking in add_timer doesn't look too good.
