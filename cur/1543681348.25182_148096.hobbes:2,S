not honoring blk_oversized_queue for BH_sync isn't safe either (still it
would be an order of magnitude safer than not honoring it for all reads
unconditonally)  there must be a secondary limit, eating all the
requests with potentially 512k of ram queued into each requests is
unsafe (one can generate many sync requests by forking some hundred
thousand tasks, this isn't only x86).
