Odd, it was either you or mpm who told me the results. I personally
never even tried running the thing. I was merely told some other, prior
attempt at doing some kind of spinlock uninlining failed to run, this
thing did, and that it shaved that memorable amount off of .text size.
I recall I compiled it myself and saw about half as much reduction
(120KB instead of 220KB), possibly due to .config or compiler differences.
I'll dust things off and so on.
