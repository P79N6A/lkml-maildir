Let's say we had two cpusets CS1 amd CS2 (both different from top_cpuset).
CS1 has just one task T1 in it (CS1->count = 0) while CS2 has no tasks
in it (CS2->count = 0).
Now consider:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
CPU0 (attach_task T1 to CS2)			CPU1 (T1 is exiting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
task_lock(T1);
oldcs = tsk->cpuset;
[oldcs = CS1]
T1->flags & PF_EXITING? (No)			
						T1->flags = PF_EXITING;
atomic_inc(&CS2->count);
						cpuset_exit()
						    cs = tsk->cpuset; (cs = CS1)
							
T1->cpuset = CS2;
						    T1->cpuset = &top_cpuset;
task_unlock(T1);
CS2 has one bogus count now (with no tasks in it), which may prevent it from 
being removed/freed forever.
Not just this, continuing further we have more trouble:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
CPU0 (attach_task T1 to CS2)			CPU1 (T1 is exiting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
synchronize_rcu()
						    atomic_dec(&CS1->count);
						    [CS1->count = 0]
if atomic_dec_and_test(&oldcs->count))
	[CS1->count = -1]
We now have CS1->count negative. Is that good? I am uncomfortable ..
We need a task_lock() in cpuset_exit to avoid this race.
