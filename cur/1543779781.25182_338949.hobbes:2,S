In a howto, I'd prefer  _one_ consistent method to reduce the 
reader's confusion.  
The above trio of commands serves me well over many years' kernel 
patching, and it is trivial to up-arrow, home, change compression 
method, retry ... when my fingers get ahead of my mind :)
Experience users recognise the intent of the commands and use their 
favourite method instead, almost without thinking.
Spelling:
s/uncompression/decompression/
s/adviced/advised/
s/bandwith/bandwidth/
Cheers,
Grant.
