Thanks, below is the patch with updated log.

Subject: gpiolib: implement dynamic base allocation
If gpio_chip->base is negative during registration, gpiolib requests
dynamic base allocation. This is useful for devices that aren't always
present, such as GPIOs from expanders on add-in cards rather than
mainboards.
To avoid reusing any numbers that may have been explicitly assigned,
but not yet registered, dynamic gpio base allocator will assign GPIO
numbers from the biggest number on down, instead of from the smallest
on up.
