On ppc the inw, inl, outw, and outl functions already byteswap, so by 
adding the extra byteswap you're now passing unswapped data to the chip. 
Take a look at include/asm-ppc/io.h and you'll see it uses byte reversed 
load and store instructions. Which means that either the chip is running 
in a big-endian mode, or that the problem is actually with data 
structures placed in host memory.
Often when porting a driver from i386 to ppc all that is required is to 
add the cpu_to_le32() macros around data in host memory that the device 
accesses, and to remove any #ifdef __powerpc__ code written by people 
who don't realise that ppc uses the standard linux pci code.
