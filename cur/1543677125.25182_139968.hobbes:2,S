Actually, it doesn't _break_, it just does something surprising (but 
possibly quite correct): it will hash the dentry to the same hash chain 
the target _used_ to be on before being unhashed. 
Which might actually be the right thing, but it still sounds to me like  
a bad idea to have a unhashed target.
