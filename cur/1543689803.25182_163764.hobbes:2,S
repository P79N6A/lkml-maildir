Earlier we _saw_ my patch do what it was supposed to:
http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/2.5/volano/
Idle time is back to mainline levels although throughput is still down
a bit. (I'd say thats due to overbalancing which could be tuned back,
I'm going to attack the SMP and NUMA stuff in the scheduler soon).

The slowdowns are due to CPUs becoming idle too long, and the patches
fix that. If CPUs aren't idle, the patch will have no effect.
I have no idea how volanomark really works, so I have no idea why the
patch causes queue imbalances. Thats the problem with those jumbo
patches :P
