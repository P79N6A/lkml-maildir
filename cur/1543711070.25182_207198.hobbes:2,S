Hi Trond,
thanks for the quick reply.
As you pointed out i've got a network which mixes 100Mbps and 1Gbps ( 
the mac is on 1Gps and the linux on 100Mbps ).
However i've done a little troubleshooting on the network and i achieve 
full 100Mbps speed scp'ing files from/to both machines.
I've also tried to use nfs over tcp instead of udp and it does not 
change anything.
I've got a Gigabit card for the Linux box and i've scheduled to install 
it within the next few days. I'll see if this helps or not.
In the meantime, any other hint is welcome.
Thanks.
