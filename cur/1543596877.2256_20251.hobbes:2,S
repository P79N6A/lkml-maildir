I think you will find that this is a problem with the basic design,
not the APIC. Just like my COMPAQ Presario 1800, everything on the
PCI bus shares the same interrupt.
You can recompile the kernel for SMP. This will guarantee that
the kernel initializes the APIC (at least up to version 2.4.1).
If you find that everything is still on the same IRQ, that's the
way it is, only one PWB trace going to the devices.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
