I think the right fix for iSER would be to make iSER work even for
devices that don't support FMRs.  For example cxgb3 doesn't implement
FMRs so if anyone ever updates iSER to work on iWARP and not just IB,
then this is something that has to be tackled anyway.  Then ehca could
just get rid of the FMR support it has.
