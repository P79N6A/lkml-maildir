This is just a guess, but it sounds to me like a scheduling issue.  When 
you're sending data from one network stack to another, how often the 
receiving program scoops data out of the incoming file descriptor isn't too 
much of a limiting factor, as long as you've got enough buffer space in the 
receiving network stack that the sender doesn't have to pause.
But to bounce the data back, the program at the far end doing the receive and 
resend has be woken up and handed a time slice with which to receive, 
process, and return the packet.
Have you tried ingo's O(1) scheduler? :)
