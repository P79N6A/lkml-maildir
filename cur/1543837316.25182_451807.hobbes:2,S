I just did a soft reboot and right afterwards I get:
$ cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature
temperature:             63 C
waited a few seconds:
temperature:             62 C
After a few minutes (while connecting back home):
temperature:             58 C
And right now:
temperature:             56 C
So it is going the opposite direction after a soft reboot.
