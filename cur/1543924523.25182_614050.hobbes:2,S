It's not an instruction-decoding issue at all (that's a 16- vs 32-bit 
issue, which can only be changed by a ljmp).  Apparently the 486DX4 
mis-executes the load to segment register, which is an EU function in 
that context.  (And yes, it's sort-of-documented behaviour in the sense 
that the documentation says "do things this way", but the Intel docs are 
unfortunately full of "do things this way" which don't make sense and 
occasionally are actively harmful, too.)

That's exactly the issue here.  The code without this patch deferred the 
long jump until after the segment loads, this worked on all processors 
except, apparently, the 486DX4.  Hence, move the ljmp up to the earliest 
possible location.
