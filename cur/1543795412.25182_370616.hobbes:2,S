Subject: [PATCH 2.6.15-rc2] m32r: Fix sys_tas() syscall
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
This patch fixes a deadlock problem of the m32r SMP kernel.
In the m32r kernel, sys_tas() system call is provided as a test-and-set
function for userspace, for backward compatibility.  
In some multi-threading application program, deadlocks were rarely caused
at sys_tas() funcion.
Such a deadlock was caused due to a collision of __pthread_lock() and
__pthread_unlock() operations.
The "tas" syscall is repeatedly called by pthread_mutex_lock() to get
a lock, while a lock variable's value is not 0. 
On the other hand, pthead_mutex_unlock() sets the lock variable to 0
for unlocking.
In the previous implementation of sys_tas() routine, there was a possibility
that a unlock operation was ignored in the following case:
- Assume a lock variable (*addr) was equal to 1 before sys_tas() execution.
- __pthread_unlock() operation is executed by the other processor
  and the lock variable (*addr) is set to 0, between a read operation
  ("oldval = *addr;") and the following write operation ("*addr = 1;")
  during a execution of sys_tas().
In this case, the following write operation ("*addr = 1;") overwrites
the __pthread_unlock() result, and sys_tas() fails to get a lock in the
next turn and after that.
According to the attatched patch, sys_tas() returns 0 value in the next turn
and deadlocks never happen.
