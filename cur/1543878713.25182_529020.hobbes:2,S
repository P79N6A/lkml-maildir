This indeed looks a lot better than the first patch. I'm too tired to
fully review this now, but could you please post the corresponding e1000
patch? From a quick look I'm guessing that this patch changes the
behaviour of the prio qdisc from strict priority to whatever scheduling
mechanism e1000 uses for its queues when the multiqueue config option
is enabled, which might surprise people.
