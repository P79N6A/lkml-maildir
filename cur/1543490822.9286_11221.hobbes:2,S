I'm looking to use multiple serial lines (56K modems) as
a temporary solution to not having a T1 for a few weeks.
Is EQL still the standard solution for this problem, or
has some other alternative (perhaps all user-space) appeared
which better solves the problem?
I can easily enable EQL and PPP in my kernels, but I've 
been searching high and low for the actual EQL utilities
("eql_enslave" and "eql_emancipate") so referenced in all
the documentation I find.  I realize EQL is a realatively
old feature, but even SunSite (or Metalab) has dropped
it from /pub/Linux/serial/.
