    The machine were I saw this error was using an UDMA 6GB drive on a
FIC-503+ motherboard with a 400Mhz K6-2 chip, 64MB 100Mhz SDRAM.  Support
for the AIC7xxx cards was compiled as a module but not loaded.  No SCSI card
was in the machine either.  What would be the most useful information to
get, once this error starts occurring, for debugging purposes?  Keeping in
mind that the error may kill the machine soon after it starts appearing, at
least thats want happened in my case.
