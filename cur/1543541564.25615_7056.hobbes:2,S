Just a quick check: we are still talking about 2.5, aren't we?

Umm... struct super_block is obese, indeed, but that can be helped.

Well, for one thing you definitely want different super_operations. Sure,
we can roll such checks into every method ("is it a real thing or just a
submount"), but that's just plain ugly. Another thing being, games with
->s_root will become painful. 
Again, I really think that lifting that limit is a good thing for many
other reasons and if we are talking about 2.5 - I'll do that. If you want
forks in 2.4.0... professional help may be in order.
As for lifting this limit - about the only place (in kernel) that really
cares is the icache. That's _very_ easy to deal with - just cache by
struct super_block * instead of kdev_t. _That_ can be done right now (I
can submit you such patch tonight if you want it) and IMO it makes sense
regardless of the limit.
Other place that cares is stat(), but that can be dealt with when we will
actually start playing with that limit.
