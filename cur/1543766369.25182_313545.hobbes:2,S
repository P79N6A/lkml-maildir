I don't believe you.  Reference?

FIPS 180-2 specifies four secure hash algorithms - SHA-1, SHA-256, 
SHA-384, and SHA-512.  We're using SHA-1.
I think you meant go with SHA-256, which is new in FIPS 180-2. FIPS
180-1 only had SHA-1.  FIPS 180-2 superseded FIPS 180-1, adding three
the algorithms SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.
