Subject: 2.4.10 vm causes buffer underruns during cd writing

This nasty thing is repeatable for me.
After beginning writing to cd, mem (cache) is growing rapidly and after about 15 
minutes
linux swaps enormous
and the system gets unusable. After about 1 minute cdrecord gets no data
anymore (it crashes) and the system is like it was before.
These problems did not occure with 2.4.9.
The following messages appear:

I use ide-scsi and /dev/hdd == /dev/scd1 == /dev/cdwriter.
Maybe this problem is in connection with ide-scsi...
At least, here's the output of cdrecord:
