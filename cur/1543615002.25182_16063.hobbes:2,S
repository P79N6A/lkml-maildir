For some people it helps when the text is in e.g. German although the
technical words are still English.
The most important point I see is: If the tanslation works similar to
gettext, IOW there's a seperate directory that contains the complete
translations I can't see problem for the "normal" kernel hacker: You don't
have to care about the translations but if someone wants to provide a
translation to e.g. Esperanto he can always do so by adding a file with
the translated texts. People like you and me who prefer the English
version can always use it but other people who prefer the translated
messages can use them instead.
