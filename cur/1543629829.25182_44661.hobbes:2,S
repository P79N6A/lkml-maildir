Terminology in 2.5:
We have a host chip set or shortly a host chip. This is implementing the
ATA interface on the side of the motherboard.
The host chip is providing two channels. A primary and a secondary
one. To a channel we can attach two devices, however we use the term
drive instead in code becouse the termi device is quite overloaded with
meaning already. The devices are enumerated as units. That's it.
Far more natural then hwif hwgrp and so on. IDE is the Integrated Device
Electronic - the microcontroller stuff I don't care that much about.
