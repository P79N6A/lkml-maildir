  I can get the system booted enough to work on (and totaly up) with this 
partition failing.  I dont know what more information from fdisk I can give 
you, sda9 is there with .10, and gone with .11  It even allowed me to add a 
new partition (i didnt save)  I tried sfdisk but it gave me these errors.
sfdisk /dev/sda -O /tmp/foo
Checking that no-one is using this disk right now ...
BLKRRPART: Device or resource busy
This disk is currently in use - repartitioning is probably a bad idea.
Umount all file systems, and swapoff all swap partitions on this disk.
Use the --no-reread flag to suppress this check.
Use the --force flag to overrule all checks.
  I didnt try the flags, Im worried that its going to overwrite my 
filesystem.  Heres my /proc/scsi/sym53c8xx/0 in case its needed.  My system 
is entirely scsi, except for an atapi burner.  All scsi compiled static.
General information:
  Chip sym53c875, device id 0xf, revision id 0x26
  On PCI bus 0, device 16, function 0, IRQ 9
  Synchronous period factor 12, max commands per lun 32
  Whats my next step?
