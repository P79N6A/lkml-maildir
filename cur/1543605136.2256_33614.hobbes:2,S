Ahh... you've never used cdrecord -scanbus
Technically, as long as the system believes that the target exists (i.e.
you haven't unloaded your SCSI driver module), the target is required to
respond to an INQUIRY command.  So, if you boot with the scanner on, and
then turn it off, you've got a problem.
What you say about behavior is correct, but it's just another symptom.  If
you run cdrecord -scanbus with a disconnected USB device, it just gives you
garbage, which is bad also.
