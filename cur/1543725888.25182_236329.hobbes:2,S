Ok, I could repruduce this issue in bash and tcsh, using both, procps 
3.1.5/3.2.2 from procps.sourceforge.net and procps 2.0.16 from 
tech9.net/rml/procps. 
So, the bug is not in the shell (which is obvious, on second thought), but in 
the kernel, glibc or procps - or the combination thereof. 
I'm using kernel 2.6.7, gcc-3.3.3, and glibc-2.3.3 with NPTL on Gentoo.
