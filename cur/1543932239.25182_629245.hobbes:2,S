Requires means requires.

I'm not sure what you are trying to show with this hack.
It's been said several times in this thread that the firmware has
nothing to do with the device radio.
So it won't affect the transmit rate or something like that.
Note that the difference between b43 and b43legacy is NOT that the
driver is "legacy". It is called legacy because it does _only_ support
legacy _devices_. So if you hack it to drive a new card it will only
work by luck (luck as in there might be some code left over which
is able to initialize the device somehow.). My point being, we removed
code for new devices from b43legacy and are probably going to remove
even more stuff in the future. So there is simply no point in testing
any new device with b43legacy.
