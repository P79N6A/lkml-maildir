Atleast one solution exists. It may be just an academic solution, though.
Add a new prio_tree root "remap_address" to anonmm address_space
structure.
struct anon_remap_address {
	unsigned long old_page_index_start;
	unsigned long old_page_index_end;
	unsigned long new_page_index;
	struct prio_tree_node prio_tree_node;
}
For each mremap that expands the area and moves the page tables, allocate
a new anon_remap_address struct and add to remap_address tree.
The page->index does not change ever. Take the page->index and walk
remap_address tree to find all remapped addresses. Once a list of
all remapped addresses are found, it's easy to find the interesting
vmas (again using a different prio_tree). Finding all remapped addresses
may involve recursion, that's bad.
