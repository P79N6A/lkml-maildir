I have about 9 NFS client test cases I regularly try because
of recurring bugs. The three problems I mailed about 2.3.18ac5
are also present in 2.2.13pre9. For the 9 test cases 2.213pre9
and 2.3.18ac5 seem compatible. Summary of problems:
1 Redirecting I/O of setuid programs to NFS mounted FS
  mostly fails because of the wrong credentials being passed
  to the server.
2 Stale file handle problem:
	sleep 10000 >file &	// client
	rm file;date >file	// server
	ls -l file		// client again
	ls: file: Stale NFS file handle
3 Negative dentry caching cannot be disabled.
IMO (1) should be fixed; it can't be that difficult because
many ac kernels don't have this problem. This bug is frequently
recurring. Maybe I'll fix it when I can find some spare hours.
(2) is difficult for me to estimate but this bug is annoying
at times.
(3) As I see it there are two possible solutions to handle
this neat feature when it is unwanted: put it under the "noac"
or other existing mount options regarding attribute caching
("acregmin=0" would work out best for me but not necessarily
for others). The alternative which is best IMO (but not acceptable
for 2.2.x I guess) is to create a new mount option. This would
also permit lengthening the negative dentry life time for those
who want it.
