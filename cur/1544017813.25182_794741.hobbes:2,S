OK, that makes sense. I just had a vague feeling that you disliked

Yeah, we don't tend to do a lot of intensive data processing, so it is
normally the cache misses that hurt most as you noted earlier.
Some places it might be appropriate, though. It might be nice if it can
bring code size down too...
