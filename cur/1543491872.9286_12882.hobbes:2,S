I'd use ALSA instead (
http://alsa.jcu.cz/
) if you have an hour or so to set
it up.  I ran ALSA with my Solo-1 under 2.2.0 (I think it was) and it worked
just perfectly.  Plus there are more and more apps coming out with native
ALSA support so you don't have to suffer with that suck OSS API.
Anyway hope this non-solution is good enough for you :)
