Clearly you have missed a large chunk of the discussion.
The file gets marked setuid-root, but only runs setuid-root as an option.
The setuid-root setting is only required to indicate trust.
magic   kernel   effect
-----   ------   --------------------------
ELF     old      setuid-root
ELF     new      as specified in the header
FLE     old      will not run
FLE     new      as specified in the header
If there is a real need to let enhanced executables run without privileges
on an obsolete kernel, there might be an ext2 flag solution for local files.
One could also _optionally_ trust the sticky bit on a read-only NFS mount.
Please read

 if you haven't
already. I'd like to have some comments on the proposal.
