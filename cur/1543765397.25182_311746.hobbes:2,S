OK, hope this patch can satisfy everyone :-)
The following is the diffstat of the enclosed patch file:
 drivers/i2c/busses/Kconfig       |   10 
 drivers/i2c/busses/Makefile      |    1 
 drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mcf5282.c |  414
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mcf5282.h |   46 ++++
 include/asm-m68knommu/m528xsim.h |   42 +++
 5 files changed, 513 insertions(+)
I did:
a) remove all trailing spaces in the files
b) re-align the switch statement
c) change a return statement
d) change some white space intents to TABs
e) insert a break for the I2C_SMBUS_PROC_CALL, thanks for spotting it
f) fix the mcf5282lite wording in Kconfig
I did not:
g) use the ioremap. This is because Coldfire is a CPU without MMU and
there is no difference between virtual and physical memory. In fact, the
ioremap routine in the m68knommu is simply a stub routine that returns
the input address argument for compatibility reason. Also, all other
Coldfire CPU include files such as the m5307sim.h uses the volatile
declaration method. 
So, I hope this is acceptable to the Linux kernel maintainers
Please let me know if there is any question.
Regards
Derek

You did not cc: the sensors mailing list, nor fix all of the coding
style issues.

Shouldn't you be calling ioremap, and not directly accessing a specific
register location through a pointer?  That's how all other arches do
this.
