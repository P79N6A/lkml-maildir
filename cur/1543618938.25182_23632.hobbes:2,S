You don't worry about that case.  If there's so much pressure that you
scan all the way to the hot end of the lru list then you will recover
that hot/cold page[1] and all will be well.  Not that the hot/cold page
will tend to migrate further away from the hot end of the list than a
hot/hot page.
[1] Assuming all the objects are freeable, otherwise you have a very
different problem: fragmentation.

I don't see that.  How does garbage collection squeeze things together?
I'm assuming these objects are pinned, at least from the VM's point of
view.
