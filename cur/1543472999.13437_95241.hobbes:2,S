Hi,
  It appears that linux 2.1.132 broked x11amp. x11amp worked fine in
2.1.131, however has stopped working in 2.1.132. I've also emailed the
author reguarding this matter, however I suspect its a kernel problem.
Here is the error message:
[bleh@nut bleh]$ x11amp
socket: Too many open files
Whooops... You caught a bug, please mail psy@x11amp.ml.org and describe
what
you were doing.
