This is a problem that's been around since 2.1.86. It doesn't
occur very often in 2.2.1, but it happened again today.
I use fetchmail a lot. fetchmail forks sendmail, and a pipe
is used to pass data between the two programs. Occasionally,
when a large email is being processed, fetchmail terminates
with a "broken pipe" message. Here's the strace from sendmail:
