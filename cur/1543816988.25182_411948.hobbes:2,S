maybe you can provide some instructions on which kernel version to use 
and how to setup the following scenario:
2CPU box. 3 VPSs which should run with 1:2:3 ratio of CPU usage.
> well, do you have numbers?
just run the above scenario with one busy loop inside each VPS. I was 
not able to observe 1:2:3 cpu distribution. Other scenarios also didn't 
showed my any fairness. The results were different. Sometimes 1:1:2, 
sometimes others.
Thanks,
Kirill
