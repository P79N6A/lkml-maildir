Heck, I hate hardware like that. Power button should kill the power,
immediately. It should not sync, it should not tell system, it should
just cut off the power. There _might_ be other button telling system
to shutdown.
Why is power button important? I already had 2 situations where
softpower could be pretty fatal, and one where it _was_ fatal.
1. on times of 486, badly inserted ISA card led to explosion of one of
low-integration chips. I've actually seen blue light. You can see
that soft-power-off is just not appropriate for such situation. [But I
probably could have survived soft-power off. Chip exploded and no more
damage seemed to happen.]
2. on the same 486, one wire got short-circuited. Smoke started
comming out of the box. By powering it down I even saved the wire (its
isolation started boiling).
3. few days ago, our hot-wave owen commited suicide. Device with soft
power controlled by CPU. During one night, CPU got crazy (power
glitch? EMI?) and heating turned on itself. Fan did not. Owen
destroyed itself.
