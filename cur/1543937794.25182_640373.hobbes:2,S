That rule of thumb makes sense if someone does a series from scratch, but 
redoing a large existing series just because someone else sneaked in a white space
patch at the wrong time does not seem to be very efficient to me.
After all these rules are not to make our lives more complicated,
but to to make things more efficient.
And most of the code in the white space cleanup changes anyways in the later 
CPA series.
And what is left you'll get them again anyways once the CPA stuff is 
in and people tested it a bit more so it has settled down.
I promise to redo them on top of the end result.
