Yes, it's always been ugly that we use unsigned long for this rather than
abstracting it properly.
However I'd prefer that we have some really good reason for introducing
irq_flags_t now.  Simply so that I don't needlessly spend the next two
years wrestling with literally thousands of convert-to-irq_flags_t patches
and having to type "please use irq_flags_t here" in hundreds of patch
reviews. (snivel, wimper)
