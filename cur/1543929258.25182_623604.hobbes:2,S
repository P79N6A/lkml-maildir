No we seem to be back recycling the fact that certain people were making
statements that might be construed, unanswered, as giving permission to
violate the GPL.
I'm merely reminding people that I've not waived my GPL rights, I've not
said modules are somehow magically OK, and I don't agree with Linus. 
The GPL very clearly says that you can make your own unredistributed
modifications and keep them that way.
