True, but that only should happen if you code things to access exact
memory locations, rather than asking the kernel for memory or mappings.

internally drivers would need to be smp safe, eh.  Externally I guess
they're safe.

yeah, I was thinking the open source drivers would be ubiquitous to all
architectures anyway though.  Closed drivers would be subject to lazy
venders.

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
    wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
    new problems waiting out there.
