	OK. That sounds reasonable, but do we want to do another forced
change, or do we want to hide it? That seems to be the root of the problem:
keeping the same API but making it work _right_.

	Well, IIRC I remember someone saying that it was legal to compare
signed/unsigned ints, if you did it in the right order. IMHO that might be
incorrect. And none of the ideas I have suggested use any fancy cpp/GNU rubbish.
The most evil-sounding thing I suggested was #4.

	Ack. (IMHO) I don't like C++ either :P
