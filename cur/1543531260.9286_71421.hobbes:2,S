Yep.  It is in hand.  You can get patches for 2.2.14 for both nfs
client and nfs server at
ftp://nfs.sourceforge.net/pub/nfs/dhiggen-2.2.14
Hopefully this will all go into an early 2.2.16-pre release.
The server stuff is all in 2.3.99pre3.  The client stuff is being
merged in now.

Trond is the guy who has been doing the NFS client improvements,
including NFSv3.
