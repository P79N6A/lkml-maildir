VM_IO flag means not to swap this memory and don't do any side-effects bound 
with that IIRC.
If you want to mmap some memory in kernel to allow userspace to be able to read 
from it, just remap and don't care. I actually don't understand, what you mean 
by remapping it back to kernelspace, can you be more specific?
Caveat of get_free_pages is that it allocates physically contiguous memory and 
this may fail in later times, when the memory is not so free. You can use 
virtual memory to avoid this: vmalloc_32_user, remap_vmalloc_range, vfree.
