Hello Shaohua,

I should have mentioned this earlier, but the comment needs work, 
something like this;
"We are about to unload the current idle thread pm callback (pm_idle), 
 Wait for all processors to update cached/local copies of pm_idle before 
 proceeding."
> +			/* If pm_idle is in a module and is preempted,
> +			 * oops occurs. Disable preempt.
> +			 */
"Mark this as an RCU critical section so that synchronize_kernel() in the 
 unload path waits for our completion."
Then resend the patch, i swear it'll be the last time ;)
Thanks,
	Zwane
