It is not clear that MSI'ing the RX interrupt to multiple cpus is the
answer.
Consider the fact that by doing so you're reducing the amount of batch
work each interrupt does by a factor N.  One of the biggest gains of
NAPI btw is that it batches patcket receive, if you don't believe the
benefits of this put a simply cycle counter sample around
netif_receive_skb() calls, and note the difference between the first
packet processed and subsequent ones, it's several orders of magnitude
faster to process subsequent packets within a batch.  I've done this
before on tg3 with sparc64 and posted the numbers on netdev about a
year or so ago.
If you are doing something like netchannels, it helps to batch so that
the demuxing table stays hot in the cpu cache.
There is even talk of dedicating a thread on enormously multi-
threaded cpus just to the NIC hardware interrupt, so it could net
channel to the socket processes running on the other strands.
