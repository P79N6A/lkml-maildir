Hi,
here is a series of RFC in attempt to implement
net-namespaces for PPP protocol (including PPPoE
and PPPoL2TP).
I would really appreciate _any_ kind of comments.
Really doubt if there is no bugs in my implementation
but it's RFC after all. Mostly -compile- tested so it
requires strong review. One more time -- I would admire
any kind of comments (even like -- it's completely broken
and full of sh*t would be fine -- but with details please :).
