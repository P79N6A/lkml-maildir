While I'm not defending macro abuse, please note that Daniele's problem
appears to have been caused by using g++ instead of gcc or gcc -x c to
compile a kernel module. Daniele's later example throws a syntax error
in gcc, since the cpp output isn't legal C ...
Hence I fail to see the utility of hacking in kludges for something
that's not supposed to work anyway.
