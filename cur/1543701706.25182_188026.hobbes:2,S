Not quite. The scheduler retains high priority for X for longer so it's no new 
dynamic adjustment of any sort, just better cpu usage by X (which is why it's 
smoother now at nice 0 than previously).

Very thorough but not a scheduler problem as far as I'm concerned. Can you not 
disable smooth scrolling and force jump scrolling?
