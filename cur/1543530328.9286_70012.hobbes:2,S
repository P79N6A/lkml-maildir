This is pure nonsense. You don't understand. I have _dozens_ of boxes.
They work fine without OOM (i.e. in 2.0.*). With OOM they murder
themselves.
If Rik's patch gets rid of the current OOM behaviour, then I am all in
favour of it. It cannot make things worse. But why not just get rid of
it? Things worked fine in 2.0.*, as far as I can see. I didn't get
cron and init being killed.
