Hm.  I didn't read the patch, so I'm only going on what you quoted.
>From that, all I see is a limit on how much will be used total, and 2/3
of physical ram is a bunch.  This quote doesn't say free ram, it says
physical ram.  If it really does use only free ram, that indeed sounds
pretty pointless.  I believe the users who say their apps really do get
paged back in though, so suspect that's not the case.
Anyway, I only offered a simple explanation of how swap-prefetching can
indeed help (and possibly hurt) with something like updatedb, not an
analysis of it's current implementation ;-)  I'd have to read it, and
test it myself to do that, but my world doesn't have a need for it,
so...
