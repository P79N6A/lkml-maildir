And it isn't only ioctls, but just having code there to set a bad
example, and added overhead of maintaining APIs used by the
driver.
Two things on top of a lot of people's pet peeves list are lack of
good review bandwidth, and poor driver code! So it is sad this was
merged without Christoph's comments being addressed. "it works for
me, we can fix it later" is probably a big reason for quality
problems of some parts of the kernel.
As for Christoph's idea of perfection... it usually isn't a bad
thing. And he is quite reasonable if you explain your good reason
to disagree or do something differently. The attitude of ignoring
comments can be really demotivating for a reviewer.
