I suspect I didn't explain clearly.  Note that the outer test expects a 
0xa5 (we pass 0x5a in).  That is what made me suspect that the second 
request gets the first ones return value.

Yes.  The commands that write something is:
CTL_WCTR
KBD_LOOP (I quess this is what breaks if no USB1.1 present in kernel)
AUX_SEND (obviously)
AUX_LOOP (the one that we think is breaking)
MIX_SEND (obviously).
All of them send exactly one byte.

Hmm, just an idea, shouldn't the i8042_write_command be waiting until 
the device has asserted the pin to indicate that the buffer is busy? 
Ie, some nice and tight loop.  This has the downside that if we check 
_just before_ the pin gets asserted, then delay and check again _after_ 
it has been cleared we will deadlock.  So the udelay() before the loop 
(or rewriting the loop to do{}while(...)) is probably a better solution, 
although this will cause us to _always_ wait at least 50 microseconds 
(not that that is a long time).

This makes a lot of sense.

No.  No difference, still the same result.

ok, how would I try this?  Where can I find an example to code it from? 
  Sorry, I should probably be grepping ...
