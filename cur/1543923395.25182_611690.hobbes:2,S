Aha - good point.  It happened to be the numactl command line utility
that I tested with that issued the get_mempolicy(0,0,0,0,0) call.
Yup - this proposed hack, to have the kernel revert to the original
memory policy nodemask numbering if it sees such a getmempolicy call
is now officially dead meat.
Thanks.

Yes - I am intending to define such MPOL_F_* flags, to set and get
which behavior applies to the current task.
