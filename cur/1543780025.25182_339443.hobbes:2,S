Hi Srivatsa.
Thanks very much for your comments. The actual codebase for dynticks I've 
never staked any claim to as it isn't mine. The demand for such a feature in 
the kernel on multiple architectures appears to have reached critical mass 
with mainline now considering another Hz change. This is why I decided to 
champion this patch at this time by polishing and tweaking it (in purely 
cosmetic ways). I mostly agree with your comments about limitations of this 
patch and would like to see changes like those you describe done in an 
arch-neutral fashion as well. I have not the hardware resources to develop 
such code and would be more than happy if have generated enough interest in 
dynticks for you to develop it further via whatever means. Knowing arm and 
S390 already have dynticks makes it more important that cross-arch code is 
consolidated sooner rather than later.
Cheers,
Con
