Yes and no.  There are a handful of standard hardware ARP types defined
in RFC826, I believe.  [checks.]  No, I guess not.   But those are
definately standardized, probably by the IEEE or somesuch.
Meanwhile, the "Dummy types for non ARP hardware" list in if_arp.h seems
to be the authoratitive non-standard standard, as it starts at 256 and
seems to pretty much sequentially count up with the occasional large
gap.   
Linux's PF_SOCKET code uses this to identify the packet type
coming off the wire.
The ARPHRD_IEEE80211 type was defined in 2.4.6 by incrementing the
number by one and appending it to the end of the list.  I just
incremented the protocol number by one for the _PRISM type.
I have no idea if there was some master list somewhere; google didn't
seem to return any hits other than the linux source.
