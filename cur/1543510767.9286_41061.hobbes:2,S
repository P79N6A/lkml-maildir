yes in did (i didn't know it :-( )

but with my patch with any bios which give the % of the battery
the kernel will give the time left of the battery (from the bios or
estimated by the kernel) when you ask it.
this will make the output of /proc/apm more uniform and consistant, because
i dont think that it should be the application which read /proc/apm
which should do special things for broken bios. (i am using wmapm
which read /proc/apm and dont report the time left).
The size of the code to do the estimation is very small (10 lines of
code and 2 static int to store some data).
but if it really is a problem to allawais insert this code in the
kernel source, i could add an option in the configuration entry of
the apm.
