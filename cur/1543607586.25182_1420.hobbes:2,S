fs/ext/acl.c has been deleted since 2.4.11-pre5, fs/ext/Makefile.in is
for 2.4.11-pre5 so it still refers to acl.o.  To use a kbuild 2.5 patch
against a newer kernel you have to identify all Makefile changes since
the kernel that kbuild 2.5 was issued against and make the
corresponding changes to the Makefile.in files.
