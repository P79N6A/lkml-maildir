Subject: [PATCH resend] vt: fix potential race in VT_WAITACTIVE handler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/1/55

From: Michal Januszewski <spock@gentoo.org>
On a multiprocessor machine the VT_WAITACTIVE ioctl call may return 0
if fg_console has already been updated in redraw_screen() but the
console switch itself hasn't been completed. Fix this by checking
fg_console in vt_waitactive() with the console sem held.

This is the 2nd version of this patch. It incorporates Andrew's
suggestions, ie. calls set_current_state() after down() and adds
a comment explaining why acquiring the console sem is necessary.
