Err, I did.  In the very next sentence to the one you quoted.
I don't see why I've triggered such a negative response to all this.
All I was suggesting was that supporting SATA as SCSI makes sense, (to me).
If we're going to do that, does it make sense to continue to add SATA
functionality to the existing (P)ATA model, or should we draw the line here?
John.
