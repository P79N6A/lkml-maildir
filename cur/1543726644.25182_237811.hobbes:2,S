Except they're about a factor 1.2 to 1.7 faster than my 100mbit, in practical
(network filesystem) application. That's very short of spectacular.

Ermm... VIA, I believe it was called Apollo Pro. VT82C693.
But as the rest may matter, the full lspci -vx listing's attached.

ipv6 was nonsense anyhow (and I think loaded as a module), smp was force
of habit as something kernely ages back wanted it. But is there really no
point to preempting in a server?
Right, both computers now run 2.6.8-rc2-mm1. It's better. Roughly
speaking, the top *benchmark* speeds, rouding slightly up, are:
udp: 33MB/s (using ~26Kints) one way, 12MB/s (9Kints/s) the other, 
tcp: 22MB/s (16Kints)one way, 12MB/s (9Kints/s) the other. 
(The 9Kints ca be 12 when the packet size is 1K or 2K)
Oddly enough, the slow direction is sending from my new computer
(XP1700, KT333, 1GB ram) to my old (both running linux and the
mentioned kernel). I'm fairly sure this is due to the fact that my
asus motherboard is crap, and I guess I'll have to settle for it,
unless one of you is very good at black magic. Because trust me, the
way hardware and chooses not to work, apparently based on slots and/or
irq's is just *weird*. Bah.
Practical speeds increased far less dramatically. nfs now sustains at
10MB/s, with the occasional 12. Samba increased less, about half a meg
a second, it sustains speeds slightly over 8MB/s, to both linux and
windows.
I guess no network filesystems focuses on speed? I mean, I did always
wonder why nfs and samba on 100mbit transfers averaged around half the
line speed, and that's counting large files (no tcp startup to blame).
I don't suppose any of you know a good windows nfs client.
I guess I'll have to settle for this. I'm just annoyed that the 'giga'
is basically a joke,  especially on my setup.
