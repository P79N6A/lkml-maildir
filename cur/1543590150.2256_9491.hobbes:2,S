Those two are the same problem, essentially. You have to copy the page, 
then map it into the same virtual address (be that userspace or 
kernelspace) as the old one. Mark the page readonly when you start to copy 
it, and have a fault handler which immediately marks it writable and 
returns. If the source is writable by the time you've finished the copy, 
repeat.
If you have to repeat yourself more than $n times, you're probably 
experiencing livelock. At that point, do what Rik said - to hell with the 
RT constraints, disable interrupts and do the copy. At least your cache is 
warm :)
