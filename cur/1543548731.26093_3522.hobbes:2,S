I am well aware of the fact that st.c is unable to suppor this drive.  It's
also unable to support the OnStream SC-30 and SC-50 units.  Realistically,
st should reject these drives -- work is being done on a patch to st do
accomplish this.
However, the userspace solution (which uses the scsi generic interface)
_will_ work with the ATAPI drive under ide-scsi emulation.  There is also
an (experimental) kernel driver (called osst) which will do the work of st
-- this driver works with the SC-30, SC-50, and DI-30 (ATAPI) units.  Of
course, the only way either the osst or sg driver will work with my ATAPI
drive is if ide-scsi will do the emulation.
I should point out that I've tested this configuration, and it works well.
Unfortunately, ide-tape and these other drivers (both sg and osst) use
different logical formats on the tape.  Tapes made on my ATAPI drive with
osst + ide-scsi are unreadble by ide-tape.  However, they are readable on
SCSI units (and should be readble with USB units as soon as I'm done with
that driver).
The point is, there is no reason for ide-scsi to refuse to do the
emulation.  I personally find that emulation useful to do backups with.
There _is_ a reason for st.c to reject these OnStream drives, but that
logic belongs in st.c, not in ide-scsi.c

You should try to see the techs say "three piece suit".
