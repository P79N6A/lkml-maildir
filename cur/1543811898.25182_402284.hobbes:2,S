I wonder if wc_wmb() is the best name.
mmiowb expands to memory-mapped I/O write barrier which more or less
describes what it does, whereas wc_wmb expands (I'm guessing) to
write-combine write memory barrier.  But it's for mmio writes.
Also, the wmb() does not actually "guarantee that PCI writes have been
flushed to the bus", at least on IA64.  Even for memory transactions,
it only guarantees ordering on IA64, much like mmiowb does for mmio
transactions.
