The main advantage of cache coloring normally is that benchmarks 
should get stable results. Without it a benchmark result can vary based on 
random memory allocation patterns.
Just having stable benchmarks may be worth it.
I suspect the benefit will vary a lot based on the CPU. Your caches may
have good enough associativity. On other CPUs it may make much more difference.
