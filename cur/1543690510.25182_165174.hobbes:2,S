When, building non-Pentium4-related code when CONFIG_MPENTIUM4 && 
!CONFIG_X86_GENERIC, it's OK that the code is incorrect for (picking 
example) AMD processors.
It would be a user bug to boot that on an AMD box, just like it would be 
user bug to boot a CONFIG_M586 kernel on an ancient 386.

When we know at compile time it's not needed, it should not be enabled.

If you're doing crazy LinuxBIOS stuff where flash size is limited, it 
makes a lot of sense.  (and I do such crazy things)  The core 2.6 kernel 
has really bloated with optional features, IMO.
