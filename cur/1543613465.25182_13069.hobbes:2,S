Patches that are unrelated to bio and obviously correct shouldn't be dropped 
indefinately, or if they're being deferred, then $maintainer should say so.

There is no reason not to have a 6 month devel cycle, and plenty of reasons 
in favour of it.  If people aren't going to bother reviewing patches in a 
timely fashion, they should tell people when a good time to resend patches 
is.  Given the whole vm fiasco in 2.4 (which is still a mess and falling 
apart for heavy loads) which stems from a lot of random direction with 
patches, I hope that some of the underlying problems will get fixed.  But 
it really doesn't look that way.
