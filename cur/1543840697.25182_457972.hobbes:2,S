This requirement, and the similar requirement that cpu_online_mask
cannot change while anybody is reading it, both appear to cry out for
stop_machine().  Readers must be able to access the cpu related
structures at all time, without any extra locking.  Updaters (which by
definition are extremely rare) stop all other cpus, do their work then
restart_machine().  That way only kernel/stop_machine.c has to care
that the cpu masks might change underneath it, the rest of the kernel
is protected with zero overhead.
