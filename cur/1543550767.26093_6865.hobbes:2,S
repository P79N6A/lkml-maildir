You don't need a checksum I think, just an atomically updated fs block 
-> actually stripe map would be enough. It can be only updated after
you wrote the new independent stripe completely. 
Simply using ordered writes for it (only write map after you wrote stripe)
may be tricky though, because you could get cyclic dependencies in a single
HW map block when the file system allocates many new stripes in parallel 
[so you would probably need something like soft updates and handling
of multiple versions of the map in core]  
Another method when you have a logging fs is to simply log the 
map block change into your normal log.  At least for ext3 and reiserfs
it would be expensive though, because they can only log complete changed
hardware blocks of the map.  JFS or XFS with item logging could do it 
relatively cheaply.
