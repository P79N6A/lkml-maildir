Umm, and how is that a problem?  Either you want online resizing because
it provides some useful functionality, or you don't want it because you
are concerned with something that nobody else in the world is.  In the
latter case, don't use it.  Even if the metadata alignment is slightly
different on disk doesn't make it in any way an invalid filesystem.  In
fact, online resizing is 100% compatible after the resize back to the
dark ages of linux.
