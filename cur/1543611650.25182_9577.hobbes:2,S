32, 64, 96 and 128
Anyway it's clear that this is a 32 cache line size setup and that such
magic numbers have to change accounding to cache line size and
associativity level.
True that with CPUs with 7 or more bits for cache line size we're going to
be subject of stack overflow.
More then increasing stack allocation i'd rather prefer to allocate two
items ( like your patch ) 1) the task_struct from a slab 2) the stack with
__get_free_pages().
What I do not really like is storing pointers inside global CPU registers,
at least until the perf difference will justify it ( we'll see ).
The stack jittering is quite easy to implement in arch/??/kernel/process.c
and another couple of fixes.
I'll try slab task struct allocation + stack base pointer indirection.
