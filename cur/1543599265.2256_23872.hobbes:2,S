Hmm... with 'writing cleanly' you mean that there should become things
available like eisa_register_device() etc...?

Yep, that was also what I figured out.

That is also what I think, but the problem is that I don't know at
which offset to look for that data...
If you look at the code:
static int getslotinfo( void )
{
  static char buff[320], *s=&buff[0]; int valid;
  inregs.h.ah=0xd8; inregs.h.al=0x1; inregs.h.cl=DiSC_Id.slot>>12;
inregs.h.ch=0;
  sregs.ds=FP_SEG(s); inregs.x.si=FP_OFF(s);
  int86x(0x15, &inregs, &outregs, &sregs);
  valid=outregs.h.ah;
  if(!valid) { DiSC_Id.it=buff[itconf]; DiSC_Id.dma=buff[dmachd]; }
  return(valid);
}
Would it help if i told you that itconf and dmachd are defined as (see
http://mc303.ulyssis.org/heim/downloads/DISCINC.H
 )
#define itconf                0xb2
#define dmachd                0xc0
So if my EISA board is at 0x1000, i should be able to read these
values from 0x1000+0xb2 and 0x1000+0xc0 ???  And if 'yes', any idea
about how to read them? (byte, word, long...? My guess would be as a
byte, but I'm not sure...)
> I thought EISA boards had gone away
Unfortunately... the device I am trying to write a driver for is
especially designed for our university.  Not many of those boards
exist in the world I guess :-(
(I hope that last sentence didn't take away your interest in my
project ;-)
Greetzzz,
