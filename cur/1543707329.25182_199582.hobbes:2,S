What does "printable" mean in this context?  Typically you have to 
convert it to UCS-4 first, so you can index into your font tables, then 
you have to create the right composition, apply the bidirectional text 
algorithm, and so forth.
Rendering general Unicode text is complex enough that you really want it 
layered.  What I described what the first step of that -- mostly trying 
to show that "throwing an error" doesn't necessarily mean "produce no 
output."  What you shouldn't do, though, is alias it with legitimate input.

Indeed.  The C language has gone with \x77 for bytes and \u7777 or 
\U77777777 for Unicode characters (4 vs 8 hex digits respectively); I 
think this is a good UI for shells to follow.  The \x representation 
then doesn't stand for characters but for bytes.  It may be desirable to 
disallow encoding of *valid* UTF-8 characters this way, though.
