Hi,
I have to correct myself:
2.6.19-7 just freezes randomly. At this point, the last surely working kernel 
i am aware of is 2.6.18, built from debian sources. Actually i'm trying 
(for the very first time) to git-bisect Linus' tree, to see if i can figure 
out something, but i feel my chances are extremely low.. 
Best
