But I don't know it's having the effect you desire... :)
By monitoring /proc/acpi/battery/*/state ("present rate" key) I found
that by using p4-clockmod at the lovest rate the processor permits, it's
actually using more energy than by using speedstep_ich (only two levels
of frequency).
I don't know if this is a bug of p4-clockmod or a hw bug in my machine
though... can you please check in your machine?
