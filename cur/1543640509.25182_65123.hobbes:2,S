Yes indeedy.  This is what DECnet Phase IV has instead of ARP.  Rather
than broadcast a query and hope someone answers with the desired mapping,
Phase IV specifies a mapping formula so that the sender can simply
calculate a MAC address for any neighbor, given its upper-level address.
That's where those AA-00-04 addresses come from -- the lowest 16 bits are
the DECnet area and node number.  There are a number of well-known
multicast addresses (AB-00-04) too.
Notice something that nobody has brought up yet (unless it's in the 3000
messages I haven't caught up to yet, sorry):  LAA and UAA addresses can
always be distinguished, by a bit in the top end.  You can manufacture all
the LAAs you want and namespace collisions are your problem, but UAAs are
expected to be unique and unchanging.
