How much overhead does polling involve?  [A particularly problematic case
is when polling is failing - I've occasionally seen speedtouch modems
where polling fails every time (not sure why) and for some reason this
increases system load considerably, which is why the speedtch driver has
a dynamic polling interval].  If polling overhead is basically nothing,
then this change is OK with me.  Otherwise the next simplest thing to do
is to have a short polling interval when the line is down, and a longer
one when the line is up.
Ciao,
Duncan.
