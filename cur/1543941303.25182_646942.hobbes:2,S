Hi,
so far we fould 2 options. The ibmebus manages (add / remove)
ONLY eHEA adapters (not ehea ethernet ports).
All ethernet ports have to be added / removed by the eHEA device driver when
an eHEA adapter has been added by the ibmebus as a new device.
This means the sysfs-links "driver" for our eHEA ethernet devices (ports) 
are not automatically generated.
Option 1)
- We can create then ourselves. Therefore we would 
  need two functions exported and included in the proper header file:
    - static int driver_sysfs_add(struct device *dev)
    - static void driver_sysfs_remove(struct device *dev)
Option 2)
- we just leave it out which would be inconsistent with
  other pci based ethernet adapters.
So far we prefer option 1. 
Do you see any other ways we should investigate? 
To resolve the build issue I've posted a first patch to remove the
old sysfs links.

Jan-Bernd & Christoph
