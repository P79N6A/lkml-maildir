At least on ix86, HZ needs to be something that CLOCK_TICK_RATE/LATCH
comes out fairly close. Remember, LATCH is the divisor for the PIT
and that PIT gets CLOCK_TICK_RATE for its input. If this number isn't
fairly 'exact' there will be much jumping of time in the sawtooth
corrector.
If you are not using ELAN, CLOCK_TICK_RATE is 1193180. If your HZ is
100, you have 1193180/100 = 1193.18, not too exact. if you use
500, you get 1193180/500 = 2386.36 which has twice as much round-off.
If you use 1193180/512 = 2330.43, even a higher fractional part.
Cheers,
