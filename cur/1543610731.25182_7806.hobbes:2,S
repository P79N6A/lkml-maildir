Sorry, I forgot to mention that I want to have all partitions encrypted.
And since there will be some kernel changes later on I don't want to
create a boot disk every time. This means it can't be very big -> no CD-R.

How?
Take a std floppy disk and boot a normal system from it... I ran out of
space.

But why would I encrypt the linux part/haven't lilo installed then?
