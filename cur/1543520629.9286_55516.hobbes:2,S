That's why I suggested SYSRQ+P as first thing :).

FYI: Andi just wrote the code to do that for the wait_on_bh case for other
needs, extending original's Andi's patch for wait_on_irq as well should be
trivial.

I of course agree it's a good idea to get more stack traces and less hang
reports from users. For debugging make no difference because SYSRQ+P
should really show the whole stack trace and CPU where the irq is running
and not only the mere EIP.
BTW, it's possible to drive the IO-APIC to send the IPI with NMI priority
(I did that for other reasons recently) and doing that we'll get a nice
stack trace even without the NMI oopser.
