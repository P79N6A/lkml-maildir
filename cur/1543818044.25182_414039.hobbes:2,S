Could you give me more info on that PCI transfer limit? I couldn't find
any reference to that on the web. Also, any way to see if that's the
real cause of the problem. I've been doing some experiments and noticed
that the percentage or xruns I get is almost independent of the period
size, which is a little odd. Any idea?
