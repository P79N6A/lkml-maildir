Is this just a basic port, or have they fleshed it out alot already?
Have they made any information on it available online yet? Or will there
probably be an official announcement next week?
More importantly in my mind, is it being rolled into 2.3 as well, or is
that out of the question with the code freeze and push for 2.4 underway?
Thanks,
Chris
