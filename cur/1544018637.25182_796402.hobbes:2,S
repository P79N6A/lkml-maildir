"Machine A - ttyS0 works fine. Can get grub output, kernel boot and 
console via ttyS0 as I wanted."
So the whole chain works fine on this machine. This couldn't work 
without CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE or if I didn't know _how_ to do it.
But to prove it conclusively
 $ zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE 
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y
Sorry for being snappy. Long day ;)
