If you don't already have fine grained process permissions ready, you are right.
In the other cases, pfksh or somethign similar would know about the special
rights of a program from checking the databases in /etc/security/ and call
/usr/bin/pfexec to set up only the needed rights and then call the program
in question.
Note that in case you call the ability to send SCSI commands a security
risk, then you need to implement all the consequences.....

As you may not know which SCSI commands are used for a specific device, this
is correct.

As it seems that this program called "udev" (if I am right) does some strange
lookup and setup which is basically the same from editing /etc/default/cdrecord
why is this program not implemented to give full support for Linux users and
_does_ edit /etc/default/cdrecord?
I don't know that program but in contrary to the concepts of Solaris where
a similar program (devlinks) that exists since 1992 creates links based only
on information found in the names from /devices, and crerates links to /dev
like this one:
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     other         45 Jul 14  2003 /dev/scg0 -> ../devices/pci@0,0/pci-ide@7,1/ide@1/scg@0,0:
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     other         39 Jul 14  2003 /dev/scg1 -> ../devices/pci@0,0/pci1000,f@9/scg@0,0:
it seems that the program udev either has access to private kernel data 
structures (from the definition of the people who like to deny access to 
this information to cdrecord::libscg) or does other strange things.
On Solaris, handling of driver instances is done inside the kernel and used
to set up device names.
You should rethink whether you still believe that udev is a clean program while
cdrecord is not.....
Please note that /etc/default/cdrecord must likely predates udev by many years
and polite authors of such a program would have added support for not only
creating links to /dev but also for adding device aliased into 
/etc/default/cdrecord.

Wrong: please check the source..... 
It does not make _any_ asumption based on uid values except for the fact that
it still tells you to become root in case something did not work.
So if there was a useful framework for the current attempt to implement 
fine grained process privilleges into Linux, cdrecord would be a candidate 
for testing....

If you really make this assumtion, you would not be allowed to implement 
fine grained process privielleges into Linux because you could not support
it at shell level. It just makes no sense to add special (currently) nonstandard
features to a kernel without providing the supporting user land programs.

You can do the same for something like Linux. You just need to implement the
interface in a way that does not contradict or influence historical UNIX
practice that made it into POSIX.

Did you forget what question from you I was replying to?
I see no relation to a holey file interface here.
