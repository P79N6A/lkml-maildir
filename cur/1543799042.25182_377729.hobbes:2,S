It would still be good to look at a fair mutex implementation first
IMO before making a choice to use unfair mutexes.
They'll often be held for longer than spinlocks so fairness may be
more important.

Is this a good idea? Then we will have for a long time different
bits of code with exactly the same synchronisation requirements
using two different constructs that are slightly different. Not to
mention code specifically requiring semaphores would get confusing.
If we agree mutex is a good idea at all (and I think it is), then
wouldn't it be better to aim for a wholesale conversion rather than
"if people want to"?
