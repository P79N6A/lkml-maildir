Using 2.5.2-pre11
# mount /cdrom && md5sum /cdrom/*
md5sum: /cdrom/dcd-c.tar.gz: I/O error
md5sum: /cdrom/dcd-d.tar.gz: I/O error
An example of some of the messages were

hdc: cdrom_read_intr: data underrun (4294967260 blocks)

  errors repeated with sector and blocks increasing by 4
  repeating 118 times
