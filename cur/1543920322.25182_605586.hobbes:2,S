Another thing to take into account is that kconfig was recently changed to 
save ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE in the .config file:
http://lwn.net/Articles/253889/
Presumably that means you'd only have to specify your arch and cross compiler 
during config, and then if you re-used that config it would re-use those 
settings.  But the existing makefile discards anything that isn't explicitly 
overridden on the make command line at each stage of the build.
It seems to me any fix should only reset CROSS_COMPILE if there isn't already 
a value for it.  (Otherwise there's a potentially subtle bug where a year 
from now you might have "m68k-linux-gnu-gcc" and "m68k-linux-gnu-pcc" and 
want to compare the results of building with the different compilers.)
I still lean towards considering any attempt to cross compile without setting 
CROSS_COMPILE an error, and not guessing at what the user meant.  But perhaps 
that's just personal preference...
