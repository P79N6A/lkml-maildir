Actually, he was trying to obtain a kernel virtual address, which
presents its own difficulties, particularly with respect to highmem.

Could you elaborate on what bad things happen here?

Yep.  MIPS's KSEG0 (a stupid design if there ever was one) and i386 large
kernel image pages are just two examples of wrinkles that would need to
be handled.  The general principle is: mappings in the kernel's virtual
address space are not maintained by the faulting mechanism, they are
maintained 'by hand'; and the cross-platform N-level page tree is defined
only for addresses that can fault.
Where the page tree does define a mapping to physical memory, obviously
only a physical address may be obtained that way, and due to highmem,
this address may not be mapped into the kernel's virtual address range,
in which case a further kmapping step has to be performed to obtain a
kernel-usable address, subject to bizarre rules that tend to change on
a weekly basis.
Somebody needs to write a book about this ;-)
