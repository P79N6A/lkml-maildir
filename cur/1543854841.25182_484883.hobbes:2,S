yeah it's a bit different from andrey's but not that much and it's more in 
the spirit of uts and ipc namespace (and user namespace if that reaches the
kernel one day :) so that's why i made the small changes.
It also helping the nsproxy/namespace syscalls to have a similar interface
to manipulate namespaces. who knows, soon we might be able to have a 'struct
namespace' with a ops field to define new namespace types ? 
I can also send a empty framework for user namespace  ;)
thanks for reacting !
