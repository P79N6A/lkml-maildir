Streams are an extension of buffered I/O implimented by the 'C'
runtime library. Streams really have nothing to do with the
internal workings of kernel I/O. As far as kernel I/O goes,
one reads() and writes() from user-space.
That said, the kernel provides getpmsg and putpmsg functions
to support streams. You really can't do much more for streams
inside the kernel and be efficient.
