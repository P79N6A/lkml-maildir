The PG_referenced bit isn't used for anything except for
NRU/LRU page reclaiming in shrink_mmap().
However, shrink_mmap() will skip over any pages that are
still mapped by processes _and_ when we unmap the page
from the (next to) last user we set the PG_referenced bit.
The PG_referenced bit is also not used at all by shrink_mmap(),
unless (page->count == 1); shm_swap() doesn't use the referenced
bit at all.

Rik
