[PATCH] I2C: Move functionality handling from i2c-core to i2c.h
So far, the functionality handling of i2c adapters was done in i2c-core
by two exported functions: i2c_get_functionality and
i2c_check_functionality. I found that both functions could be reduced to
one line each, and propose that we turn them into inline function in the
i2c.h header file, much like other i2c helper functions (e.g.
i2c_get_clientdata, i2c_set_clientdata and i2c_clientname).
The conversion of i2c_get_functionality suppresses a legacy check which
shouldn't be needed anymore. Only one driver (s3c2410) was still relying
on it, and was fixed some days ago.
The conversion lets us get rid of two exports. Not only i2c-core gets
smaller (by 458 bytes), but the client drivers using these functions get
smaller too (typically by 48 bytes). And of course the new way is likely
to be faster too, even if it wasn't my primary objective.
