It _looks_ like PREEMPT/SMP is one common configuration.
It might also be that the blocksize of the filesystem matters. 4kB 
filesystems are fundamentally simpler than 1kB filesystems, for example. 
You can tell at least with "/sbin/dumpe2fs -h /dev/..." or something.
Andrei - one thing that might be interesting to see: when corruption 
occurs, can you get the corrupted file somehow? And compare it with a 
known-good copy to see what the corruption looks like?
