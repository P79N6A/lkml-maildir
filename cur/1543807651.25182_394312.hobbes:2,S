Hi,
	This is not an attempt to start a religious flamewar about what is
RAID vs. what is softraid vs. what is fakeraid. 
	Does anyone has a list/refence/etc on reasonably modern SCSI
controllers (at least u160) in a non-fakeraid way i.e. the way that would
allow linux to boot from a RAID protected disk array when one of the drives
in the array failed even if the root filesystem is located on the same
array?
Thanks,
Alex
