With all due respect, Linux gets driven as much from the bottom up
as it does from the top down I think. Compared to desktop and small
servers, yes you are obscure :)
My view on it is this, we can do *exclusive* dynamic partitioning
today (we're very close to it - it wouldn't add complexity in the
scheduler to support it). You can also hack up a fair bit of other
functionality with cpu affinity masks.
So with any luck, that will hold you over until everyone working on
this can agree and produce a nice implementation that doesn't add
complexity to the normal case (or can be configured out), and then
pull it into the kernel.
