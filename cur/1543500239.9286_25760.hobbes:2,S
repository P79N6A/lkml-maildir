Well, I don't run quotas on the system I had the FS corruption with (it
is my desktop box at work).  I do have SCSI (aic7xxx, which had a driver
update in 2.2.10 that now enables tagged queueing by default IIRC), but
I don't have IRDA or NFS (client or server).  I did have NFS compiled in
2.2.9 when I had trouble, but not in 2.2.10 when I had trouble again.
With 2.2.5 on it, I ran a script (taken from the pages about the AMD K6
with Linux) that basically does "make -j4" of the kernel and then
compares the results from run to run.  I use this as a good burnin test
of systems these days.  I ran this burnin on 2.2.5 for about 18 hours
and it didn't have any trouble.
What I will try to do (probably will be a day or two) is setup a scratch
partition on my system and boot 2.2.10.  I'll mount all the other
partitions read-only, and then run the burnin script with the kernel
source on the scratch partition.  If it fails (and I think it will after
a while), then at least I'll have a way to reproduce the problem and
test changes.
The first time I had corruption (under 2.2.9) I was doing something
like:
find /usr/local/src/linux -type f -name '*.[ch]' -print | xargs fgrep foo
That would run okay, but then I'd try a different search and I'd start
getting the "attempt to read past end of device" and readdir errors.
Then, when I stopped the find and did "ls /usr/local/src/linux", I got
an empty directory.
IIRC I was doing something similar when the corruption happened again.
I thought it was a hardware problem at first, because I am using an
older drive.  I've never seen corruption like this in all the time I
have been using Linux (back to 0.99 days), although I do avoid the known
bad development kernels always.  But then I realized that I didn't get
ANY SCSI errors and that when I run 2.2.5 I can't make the same thing
happen no matter how hard I try.
