Because its a moderately bad spec that your vendor implemented to deal
with a horrid redmond interpreter.  (And, to make things worse, the
linux-acpi team specifically insists on implementing the spec, not the
reality. "We refuse to be bug-for-bug compatible with the other major
implementation."  So linux-acpi is "right" but redmond-acpi is tested
and actually works.)

I'm kinda fond of battery status. And pci interrupt routing (convenient,
that..) and the half-dozen or so important other functions that even a
half-broken ACPI provides on my main machine (laptop, no APM support at
all.)  And as a side note, especially on laptops, the DSDT (bios "talk
to acpi-managed hardware like this" bytecode) tends to be dramatically
broken.  acpi.sf.net has info on patching it, some pre-patched tables,
etc.
Hate it? Well... that'd be why its a configure option.
