Nope.  Because when CPU0 reads 1 from valid, the value read is still
not retired (i.e. committed) and at this point it sees that value is
set to 45 (because it couldn't have seen valid=1 before seeing value=45
since writes are not reordered).  So it will re-exec the read of value
(because the not-yet-committed-read is still around and its address
is matched to the incoming writes, allowing to detect such problems).
Now I don't know if this is part of x86 or only P6 since
supposedly the P6 provides a slightly stronger consistency model.
Also this solves the present case but not the one I sent earlier
because no CPU needs to see any of the other's writes, so the
instructions can all be retired before any communication takes place.
