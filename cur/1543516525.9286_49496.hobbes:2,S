Hi:
My system is redhat 6.0 on a PC. NFS can't work. when i run `df' , it
can not terminate.
and display this error:
        nfs: task 24 can't get a request slot
then i try to kill `df` with -9, and it display the following msg:
        nfs_statfs: statfs error = 512
what's more, when the system shuts down, linux can't umount all file
system. It just says
that the nfs device busy and sometimes the system hangs up.
Thanks for any help or advice.
