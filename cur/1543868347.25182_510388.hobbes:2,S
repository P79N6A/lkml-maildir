I welcome this patch. 
From my experience, this infinite loop in cache_alloc_refill() is caused by 
double-free, always...(I'm sorry if my knowledge around the slab is too old.)
And it looks this additional check can caught the problem but maybe no help for
fixing problem...How about adding printk like this ?
==
if (unlikely(slabp->inuse >= cachep->num)) {
	printk("A problem is detected on slab %s\n", cachep->name);//this information is useful.
	printk("please use DEBUG_SLAB kernel for detecting what happens.");
	BUG(); 
}
