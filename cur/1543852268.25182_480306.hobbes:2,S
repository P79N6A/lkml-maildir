config time is not possible (not to mention it's not that uncommon to
config on a different box than you compile). Makefile side is not that
hard; in fact what you'd need is a very small check similar to
scripts/gcc-x86_64-has-stack-protector.sh . While that checks a gcc
feature, checking the VMX operations via a C program with inline asm is
actually the most realistic test ANYWAY ...
