The dependency for docs is (now) wrong.
It should be:
# Documentation targets
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%docs: scripts_basic FORCE
        $(Q)$(MAKE) $(build)=Documentation/DocBook $@
docproc is the only binary used by Documentation/Docbook, and it is already
placed in scripts_basic.
Trivial - so I will include this in some other kbuild patch
I'm preparing.

Yes, several of the ninaries do so. Among others empty.o.

Test a bit more, and you will see they are indeed needed.
Note, some archs other than i386 have a bit different requirements
because thay do not use an asm-offsett.h file.
