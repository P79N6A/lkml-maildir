I should have been more precice. We used field returned parts which 
had reported SBEs and had been exchanged in the field. Our goal was to
see if any of these parts "de-generate" over time. Most of these parts
had hard single bit failures in one or more locations. As I said,
we didn't find evidence that even hard SBEs turn into a multiple bit
error. Of course the chances of getting a UCE are higher when a "soft"
SBE occurs in a memory location which already has a hard SBE.
