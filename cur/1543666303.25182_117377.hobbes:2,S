Yes.  It is the reference block-backed filesystem for the VFS and VM API.  If
a feature is added to core kernel, ext2 gets to use it first, and ext2 is the
place to look to see "how is it done".
Arguably, minixfs should be playing that role, and it is close.  But it is
now missing a few things.
ext2 is also scarily quick.
