And if it doesn't then it is (by definition) not interactive. :-)
As you imply, this change is targetting those tasks whose ONLY 
interruptible sleeps are due to NFS use.

Exactly.  It's all about latency and doesn't really effect the 
allocation of CPU resources according to niceness as that is handled via 
differential time slice allocations.
