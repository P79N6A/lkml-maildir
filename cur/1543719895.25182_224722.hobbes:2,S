That doesn't make sense.
My node_read_cpumap() routine is being passed a finite length buffer
into which it is supposed to put some characters.  Unless by contract
or passed value it knows the length of that buffer, it cannot safely
know how far it can write.
Apparently, from Andrews comments and from the line:
  buffer->page = (char *) get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL);
in file.c:fill_read_buffer(), the length is PAGE_SIZE, by contract.
Greg - perhaps a comment in include/linux/sysdev.h, near the declarations
for the show() and store() routines, specifying the buffer sizing,
would be appropriate?
