Hi again.
I should mention that the code is not perfectly stable at the moment. As soon as it is I'll get 
stuck into last cleanups and then the merge. Crashes I'm seeing involve an oops shortly after 
resuming, occuring in slab code. Obviously an inconsistency has somehow sneaked in. I'm away from 
home for 8 days from Monday AM, so a fix won't be forthcoming this week. It shouldn't be far away 
though.
Regards,
Nigel
