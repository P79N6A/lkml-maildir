Yes. I already did suspend to network last March, but haven't spent more time 
on it since - it wasn't working perfectly, but it was working using a 
modified userspace nbd client.

Ditto in reverse. I have to admit I'm still struggling to see what the 
advantage to userspace is. At the moment, it seems to me like nothing more 
than an extra layer of complexity and new possibilities for failure. Maybe my 
attitude will change when I look at it more.

No problems there. I only reboot when forced to, and suspend to disk by 
default (or to put it another way, I eat my own dog food).

That's why I want to use the existing bio calls and crypto api support. I 
don't use the swap read/write routines because... well I've forgotten the 
reason 3 years later. Let me take a guess though - using swap routines might 
corrupt LRU? One thing I do know is that the filewriter and swapwriter use 
the same code to do the writing. I'd be more accurate in calling them 
swap/file allocators now, as they really only calculate where to store the 
image (and associated functions).

Strange.

True, and an unencrypted image on disk is as vulnerable as any other data on 
disk anyway.

True, but can you really imagine people doing that? The one instance I can 
think of was the donation of LZF support to Suspend2 a couple of years back.

I don't want it to be true, but I think you're being naive in saying that :) 
We'll see, won't we?
