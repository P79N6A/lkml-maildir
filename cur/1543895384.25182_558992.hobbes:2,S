Somone just needs to find a way to only lock the socket as it is
being operated upon.
The race you are dealing with is rather simple, the queue check
and the state check need to be done atomically.  The only chore
is to find a way to make that happen in the context of what the
garbage allocator is trying to do.
I'm not even convinced that your most recent attempt is deadlock free.
Locking multiple objects the same way all at once like that is
something that needs to be seriously audited.
