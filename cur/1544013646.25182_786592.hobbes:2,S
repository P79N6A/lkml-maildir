Well, we should be able to tell where we got the port information from, 
if it's somewhere expected to be reliable like PCI configuration, ISAPnP 
or PnPACPI, or whether we're just probing magical ports and hoping to 
find something.
The only cases on x86 hardware where I would think probing would have to 
happen would be where the machine was too old to do either ISA Plug & 
Play or PnPACPI, or if you added in a non-PnP ISA modem or serial card.
