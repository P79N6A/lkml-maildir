I do understand what happens in the VM currently... And as noted I run
both -aa kernels and rmap on different machines. But -aa runs better on
large machines and rmap better on small machines with memory pressure (my
experience), so blessing one and making the other "only a patch" troubles
me somewhat. I hate to say "compete" as VM solution, but they both solve
the same problem with more success in one field or another.
If either is adopted the pressure will be off to improve in the areas
where one or the other is weak, Once the decision is made that won't
happen, And if rmap is a large VM change, what then is Ardrea's code?
Large isn't just the size of the patch, it is to some extent the size of
the behaviour change.
For me it makes little difference, I like to play with kernels, and I'm
hoping for the source which needs only numbers in /proc/sys to tune,
rather than patches. But there are a lot more small machines (which I feel
are better served by rmap) than large. I would like to leave the jury out
a little longer on this.
I was looking for opinions, thak you for sharing yours.!
