I can't find any information about the softlock feature in the PRI
block. However, the AT49BV6416 is obsolete, and the replacement chip,
AT49BV642D, does not power up locked. We'll be using AT49BV642D for new
designs, but in order to support the AT32STK1000 development board, we
need to install a fixup for AT49BV6416.
Another issue is that Atmel uses a different PRI block than AMD. I can
work around this by installing a CFI fixup that converts the Atmel PRI
block to look like an AMD block.
Alternatively, we could define a vendor-independent format with just
the information we need and select different readers/parsers based on
the JEDEC manufacturer ID. Do you know if there are other vendors using
the AMD command set but a different PRI format?
