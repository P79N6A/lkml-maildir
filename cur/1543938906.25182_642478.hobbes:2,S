I just tried the 2.6.24-rc7 sata_nv driver with one hd and  one cdrom in
the same controller. 
I mkfs hd and mounted the cdrom and no error happened.
Allen,  is there anything about notifier that we should pay attention
to?

I have not yet reproduced the switching issue even if i removed the
udelay function according to your metholds.
I tried the 2.6.24-rc7. 
 I don't know what kernel version can easily reproduce the issue or
mabye i omit some steps during test.
