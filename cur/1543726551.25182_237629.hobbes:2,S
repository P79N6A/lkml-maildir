Yes, but ...
(1) it doesn't change the fact that the caching is in the vast majority
of cases just wasting of RAM, even if it will happen only with a couple
of cards.
(2) not all drivers dwell in the kernel.
I would prefer keeping sysfs access the ROM directly, with a little
work-around disabling the sysfs file for the devices known for sharing
decoders and to offer a boot-time parameter for forcing the copy in case
you really need such feature for that particular device.
				Have a nice fortnight
