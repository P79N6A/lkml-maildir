Well, squashfs is an *excellent* filesystem with very high compression ratios
and high speed on slow I/O devices such as CDs. I now use it to store my root
FS in initrd, and frankly, having a fully functionnal OS in an image as small
as 7 MB is "a good enough improvement over cramfs".
If the 4 GB limit goes away one day, I hope it will not increase overall
image size significantly, because *this* would then become a regression.
Perhaps it would simply need to be a different version and different format
(eg: squashfs v3) just as we had ext, then ext2, or jffs then jffs2, etc...
Cheers,
Willy
