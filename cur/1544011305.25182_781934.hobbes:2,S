I put in a patch once for the Dell MM061 (UK Inspiron model) with
similar issues:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/7/121
If the module doesn't recognise the version model, you have to use
'force=1'... and if that works, you still get the 'unable to detect SMM
BIOS version' message.
But all appears to function fine with the patches to include version
models.
