Subject: [PATCH] pid: Implement ns_of_pid
A current problem with the pid namespace is that it is
easy to do pid related work after exit_task_namespaces which
drops the nsproxy pointer.
However if we are doing pid namespace related work we are
always operating on some struct pid which retains the pid_namespace
pointer of the pid namespace it was allocated in.
So provide ns_of_pid which allows us to find the pid
namespace a pid was allocated in.
Using this we have the needed infrastructure to do pid
namespace related work at anytime we have a struct pid,
removing the chance of accidentally having a NULL
pointer dereference when accessing current->nsproxy.
Changelog[v2]:
	- Add a note in function header of ns_of_pid() re: NULL pid.
