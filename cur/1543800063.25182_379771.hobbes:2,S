This is with all mutex patches applied and CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEX_FULL=n, 
therefore using the current semaphore code:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
1821108	 287792	  88264	2197164	 2186ac	vmlinux
Now with CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEX_FULL=y to substitute semaphores with 
mutexes:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
1797108	 287568	  88172	2172848	 2127b0	vmlinux
Finally with CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEX_FULL=y and fast paths inlined:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
1807824	 287136	  88172	2183132	 214fdc	vmlinux
This last case is not the smallest, but it is the fastest.

The function call overhead on x86 is less significant than the ARM one, 
so always calling out of line code might be sensible in that case.
