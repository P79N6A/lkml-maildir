Would it make sense for the driver model core to add a "miscellaneous" or 
"other" bus, intended for devices or drivers that are one-of-a-kind or 
otherwise non-standard?  Kind of similar to the platform bus but meant 
for new things, not part of a legacy or other system/architecture-specific 
base?
Doing this would give people a place to register these things without 
forcing them to go to the trouble of making up their own special-purpose 
bus or class.  And without the extra code/data space a special-purpose 
driver-specific bus would require.
