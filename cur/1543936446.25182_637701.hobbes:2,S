OK, the problem might actually not be the omission of displaying the 
tainted information but the omission of considering any relevant 
context.
Looking deeper:
Number #2424 is WARN_ON-after-tainted-oops.
Is your rank 1 just a symptom that the system is in a bad state after 
running in what is your rank 8?
In this case the information when following e.g. #2827 is quite useless 
since wherever you got this trace from all related context information 
like e.g. whether it's like #2424 just the symptom of a previous Oops is 
not displayed.
In the worst case, an entry might only contain WARN_ON traces without 
any information where the traces came from and whether it's worth 
looking at them or whether the system always already was in a known-bad 
state when they occured?
