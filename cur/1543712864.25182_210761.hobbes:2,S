I will probably compile new kernel before friday. I had some urgent tasks 
to solve in normal differetial equations on my university :).
But this seems the right solution/workaround for the problem and probably 
should work (of course I do not know if there are other bugs preventing 
modem_run from continuing :)).
I will post the anwser as soon as possible.
thanks once more
Grzegorz
