I don't know that any mechanism currently exists.  It shouldn't be
too hard to create on though.  Just modify the proc handler in 
drivers/scsi/scsi.c.
While your looking at that, I would like to better understand why the
device is being set offline.  The message listing you've provided is
not complete.  If you send me all of the messages output by the driver
from boot through failure I will try to diagnose your problem.
