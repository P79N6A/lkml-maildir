Greg, you know why: Cost.
Asking the BIOS provider to roll a new version costs.
Rolling the BIOS version might also require re-running the OS "Certification".
Besides the cost of an OS re-cert, BIOS changes are unlikely to happen if
it will delay the introduction and/or sale of new products.
And it's not considered to be a "BIOS" problem unless win XP (or maybe
"Vista" these days) fails the same way (which BIOS supplier would have
fixed...).
