I am really thinking that this variable order page cache approach 
is likely going to result in the final death of the huge page subsystem. I 
would like to keep huge pages separate from this so that the huge page 
subsystem can be removed at some point without too much trouble. Right now 
it is a very sore point at least from a performance standpoint since the 
hugetlb subsystem is serialized with a single lock. There is a weird maze 
of locking and accounting constraints in there that makes it difficult to 
fix this.

Right. There is no reason for hugetlbfs to exist anymore. We will have 
very transparent and flexible support for huge pages.
