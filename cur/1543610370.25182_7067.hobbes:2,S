Something is indeed very wrong. Your setup uses a PIII, and no SMP. It
shouldn't be requiring atomic_dec_and_lock() at all. Certainly this is
the case on my own setup on stock 2.4.15-pre9.
Could you check that the TUX patch isn't squashing the #define and
test for ATOMIC_DEC_AND_LOCK that is contained in
include/linux/spinlock.h in the stock Linus kernel. The latter is a
workaround that is designed to stop MODVERSIONS from interfering with
the re-#definition of atomic_dec_and_lock() in spinlock.h.
Cheers,
