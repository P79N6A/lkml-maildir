i have released the -V0.7.33-0 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this is mainly a port from -rc2-mm3 to -rc3-mm1. Changes:
- due to 2.6.10 release work the -mm kernel now is in fixes-mostly mode,
  but there's one interesting new feature: -rc3-mm1 introduced the
  ->unlocked_ioctl method which is now an official way to do BKL-less
  ioctls. I changed the ALSA ->ioctl_bkl changes in -RT to use this
  facility. The ALSA/sound guys might be interested in these bits. Thus
  another chunk of -RT could go upstream.
- IO-APIC/MSI fix from Steven Rostedt.
- fixed a tracer bug which would produce a kernel warning and an empty
  /proc/latency_trace if the trace buffer overflows.
to create a -V0.7.33-0 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
