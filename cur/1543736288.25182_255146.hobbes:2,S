At the moment if the user types a character and the line discipline
echoes it then you can get a write call to the driver. N_TTY tends to do
this one. When we close the ldisc first this should go away, but we
aren't quite there yet.

Ok so this probably is a close v open->hangup race. In which case it
shouldn't be too hard to fix now the first locking work is done. Until
then the change you suggest makes sense. I'll investigate that race in
more detail however because close() v open() and close cancelling the
workqueue for hangup ought to be stopping it.
