The model looks valid. I have difficulty constructing many scenarios
where its useful but it appears valid providing you can tightly control
file renaming, which is very very questionable.
There are also some very awkward path based issues around shared file
objects (your controlling tty and TIOCSTI for one) that I need to look at
the code for once the VFS stuff is sorted and its likely to get merged.
