Ok - you just need to give me a wait queue then and I would be happy
to add the wakeups to the low level code
(or you can just do it yourself	if you prefer, shouldn't be very difficult ... - just
needs to be done for both swiotlb and GART iommu. The other architectures
can follow then. At the beginning using an ARCH_HAS_* ifdef might be a good
idea for easier transition for everybody)
