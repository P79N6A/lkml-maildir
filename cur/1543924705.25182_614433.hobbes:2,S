Problem is repeatable on my computer. It dies in __module_get() on this 
line:
 		BUG_ON(module_refcount(module) == 0);
I think this is because commit 7b595756ec1f49e0049a9e01a1298d53a7faaa15, 
which states: "Note that with this change, userland holding a sysfs node 
does not prevent the backing module from being unloaded."
Unfortunately, I don't know how this sysfs stuff is supposed to work, and 
therefore don't know how to fix the problem.
