Hello,
I'm currently having troubles while trying to listen or rip cds audios.
`cdparanoia -Q` works fine
but `strace cdparanoia 1` hangs at :
ioctl(3, 0x530e
Then I have from `dmesg` :
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: lost interrupt
(...)
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: lost interrupt
The only thing I found in archives is :
" It seems like the 'lost interrupt' while
ripping audio CDs is specific to VIA based motherboards."
In fact, I have a VIA based motherboard :
VIA KT333 and VIA 8233A
I'm using Linux version 2.4.21 (gcc version 3.2.2) #2 Thu Jul 3 12:42:17

I tried setting using_dma 0, unmaskirq 0.
Otherwise, my cdrom works perfectly for data cds.
Please help me
