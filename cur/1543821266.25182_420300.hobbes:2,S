True, current pgd is overwritten but that effects only user space mappings
and currently "crash" supports only backtracing kernel space code. But at
the same time probably it is not a bad idea to maintain a separate page
table and switch to that instead of overwriting the existing pgd. This
shall help if in future user space backtracing is also supported.

I think you also need to write the logic to free those pages if somebody
chooses to unload the pre-loaded kernel.

Would it make a cleaner interface if these array of pointers are maintained
in arch dependent code as global variables instead of putting in arch
independent code. Existing code does something simlar. This becomes further
ugly when another array comes into the picture for x86_64 in next patch.
