I see a lot of new Red Hat work getting discussed, landing in the 2.5 
tree, and then getting backported as a value-add 2.4 feature for an RH 
kernel.  Other stuff is "hack it into stability, but it's ugly and 
should not go to Marcelo."
IMNSHO this perception is more a not-looking-hard-enough issue rather 
than reality.
I have no idea about UnitedLinux kernel, but for RHAS I wager there is 
next to _nil_ patches you would actually want to submit to Marcelo, for 
three main reasons:  it's a 2.5 backport, or, it's a 2.4.2X backport, 
or, its an ugly-hack-for-stability that should not be in a mainline 
kernel without cleaning anyway.

Can you actually quantify this divergance?
 From actually _looking_ at RHAS for submittable patches, it seems to me 
like mostly 2.5-backport patches in 2.4, or, bandaid-until-2.5 fixes 
that don't belong in mainline.
