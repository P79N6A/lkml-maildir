I guess you need to pass down the size of the buffer too.

that's fine with me, but allocating a lock dynamically? then probably
you should force the caller to allocate it, and force it to pass it down
either in the alloc or in the init function, the caller is going to have
a bigger data structure where it will embed the kfifo structure, so it'd
be normally zerocost for the caller to allocate a lock outside the
kfifo, even if the API becomes a bit uglier, but I don't see the need of
separate slab allocation for a single spinlock.

indeed ;) (should be in theory a private field)
thanks.
