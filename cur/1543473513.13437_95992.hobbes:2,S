Well I thought I had the latest. I will check it out. The libc is
glibc-2.0.6. There is a newer version, but it failed to compile using
gcc-2.7.2.
I guess I will have to unstall another compiler, but the egs thingy
breaks a lot of code as you can see from the mailing list.

I think having a swap-file that is smaller than physical RAM negates
the true value of a swap-file. It's probably time for the kernel and
tools to allow a swap-file that is at least as large as the RAM that
can be addressed (real, not virtual).
