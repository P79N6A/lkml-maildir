The 45% doesn't mean much by itself.
What does "hdparm -T" give you?
(Uppercase T -- times memory/filesystem
throughput, without accessing the device).
If it gives something like 60-70MB/sec,
then your 25-30 is indeed 45% of your memory bandwidth.
Eg.  My P2-400 with IDE drives gives 22MB/sec reading
from the drives, chewing up 14-18% of the CPU, mostly in copying
memory around.  The -T thingie gives 116MB/sec, so we have:
	22 / 116 = 18%
The darned thing even makes sense, given sufficient context.
