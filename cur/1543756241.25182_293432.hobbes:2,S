Subject: Reading Bad DVD Under 2.6.10 freezes the box.

I have a DVD where I have three files on it, (1.7gb,1.7gb,900mb).
On W2K, when I try to copy the second file, I get a BadCRC error message.
Under Linux, I copy up to about 860MB (watched via pipebench) and then it 
freezes the machine, I cannot ping or get to it or do anything on the 
console; instead, I am forced to hard reboot.
Main Question >> Why does Linux 'freeze up' when W2K gives a BadCRC error 
msg (never freezes)?
The DVD FS is Joilet+ISO (hence, why none of the files are bigger than 
2GB), is this normal?  Or is there no checking code when there are errors 
on DVD's to kill the read/etc so it does not freeze the box?
Thanks.
