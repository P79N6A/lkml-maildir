That's ok.
There's a very legitimate difference between a filesystem designed for
something (ie HFS or NTFS resource forks are an integral part of the
filesystem) and a cool hack a la .rpm and .tar.gs filesystems.
I agree 100% that even if you could use the same mechanism to create tar-
anf rpm-filesystems (and obviously you can), they shouldn't be automatic
in the same sense. That's a strong case for autofs or special user tools
for mounting.
But as a HFS user I'd be disappointed if a part of the filesystem didn't
just automatically do the right thing.
