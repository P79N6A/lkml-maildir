Yes, I see it now: had trouble with the line wrap!
Sure, that's one of the scenarios we were talking about, and getting
additional references in valid_swaphandles will stop that particular
race.
It won't stop the race with "bare" read_swap_cache_async (which can
happen with swapoff, or with vm_swap_full deletion if multithreaded),
and won't stop the race when valid_swaphandles->swap_duplicate comes
all between try_to_swap_out's get_swap_page and add_to_swap_cache.
The first of those is significantly less likely than swapin_readahead
instance.  The second requires interrupt at the wrong moment: can
certainly happen, but again less likely.
Adding back reference bumping in valid_swaphandles would reduce the
likelihood of malign read_swap_cache_async/try_to_swap_out races,
but please don't imagine it's the final fix.
