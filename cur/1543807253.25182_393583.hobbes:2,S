SCMs don't fix anything. The real work is in selecting patches and 
merging them. Frankly,  I test a lot of stuff myself, and the tarballs 
are  a damned sight easier to work with, and have a simple chronological 
timeline to work from.
Yes, of course you don't want to pull 23 separate patches from a mailing 
list. But quilt+tarballs is a crapload simpler than git / bk / cvs / 
subversion, and works just as well, if not better. It just needs a 
script to roll up patches into a consolidated one, and it's not like 
Andrew doesn't have that already.
