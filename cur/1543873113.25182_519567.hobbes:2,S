The simple change to not NULL the ->port[] array after unregister was
not quite enough, as ->shutdown() would, as hinted at by Mark, then
access kfree'd memory.
The best thing to do is to just revert
d9a7ecacac5f8274d2afce09aadcf37bdb42b93a and work out a better fix for
the next release.  My patches to fix ftdi_sio no longer require this
patch, so it is pointless at this late state if it breaks *anything*,
and it does.
This patch reverts d9a7ecacac5f8274d2afce09aadcf37bdb42b93a since it
breaks drivers that need to access the ->port[] array in shutdown
(most of them).
