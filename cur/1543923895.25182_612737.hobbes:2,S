[one more patch added to the 2.6.22-stable queue]
From: Gregory Haskins <ghaskins@novell.com>
patch 3aa416b07f0adf01c090baab26fb70c35ec17623 in mainline.
lockdep: fix mismatched lockdep_depth/curr_chain_hash
It is possible for the current->curr_chain_key to become inconsistent with the
current index if the chain fails to validate.  The end result is that future
lock_acquire() operations may inadvertently fail to find a hit in the cache
resulting in a new node being added to the graph for every acquire.
[ peterz: this might explain some of the lockdep is so _slow_ complaints. ]
[ mingo: this does not impact the correctness of validation, but may slow
  down future operations significantly, if the chain gets very long. ]
