It's like the /dev/ttyS* and /dev/cua* situation, where
we also ended up with multiple device files. This is bad.
SG_IO-on-hdx is modern. It properly associates everything
with one device, which you may name as desired.
sg0 is useful for devices that are not disk, tape, or CD.
A decade ago, it was also the proper way to send raw SCSI
commands to other devices. For nasty compatibility reasons,
Linux still assigns /dev/sg* devices for disk, tape, and CD.
