One of the reasons why hardware vendors want to move away from 
traditional accesses is to be able to use the larger config space in 
PCI-Express, rather than being locked into the 256-byte legacy PCI 
config space.
Several modern PCI-Express devices utilize the upper config space, but 
due to legacy reasons the registers are usually ones that do not require 
OS drivers to know about (like BIST stuff or diagnostic registers).
Expect that to change, as MS shakes out the bugs (or maybe we are doing 
their job for them?).
