This approach in GIGO-like, IMHO. Ugliness of (default) boot process
messaging itself can and must be solved in the userspace. I don't know if
anybody read sub-thread about size reduction by moving static printk
string to userspace "message codes" (there were one more person than me,
but still).
The main problem, is the very narrow perspective of such "kernel"
functionality:

See? In the userspace one can make anything freely, try do it in the
Linux kernel. With userspace {codes, messages} -> messages tool, any
console printing frontend is possible. Of course, when kernel OOPes
before or in early userspace, where nothing other than photo viva is
possible, nobody should care about "Linux's cuteness!"

Is it possible to have a macro for this, which will be
`do { } while(0)' in case of "NO, thanks" configuration?
