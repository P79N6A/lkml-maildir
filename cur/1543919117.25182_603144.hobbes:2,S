Hi list,
i'm developing an application (in C) which needs to write about 
1Gbit/s (125Mb/s) to a disk array attached via U320 SCSI. 
It runs on Dual Core 2 Xeons @2Ghz utilizing kernel 2.6.22.7. 
I buffer the data in (currently 4) 400Mb buffers and use write(2) in a
dedicated thread to write them to the raw disk (no fs). 
The write(2) performance is not good enough, the writer threads take to
much time, and i ask you for ideas, howto to boost the write
performance. 
Maybe mmaping the disk would work? 
Cheers,
-Michael
