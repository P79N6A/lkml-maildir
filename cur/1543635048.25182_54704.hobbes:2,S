I am running a Red Hat 7.2 load (Kernel version 2.4.7-10). I am trying to
enter the following command to change the MAC address on my device.
ifconfig ifp0 hw ether A2:A5:A5:01:00:00
ifp0 is my own device which replaces eth0. The system gives me a response
"SIOCSIFHWADDR : device or resources busy"
The same exact command works on my 2.2.16 Kernel. Any ideas why the error.
Please CC me directly in any responses.
Thanks in advance,
