I was hoping that eventually certain pieces will stop moving and will
become a base that we can ask people to rebase on top of.  Perhaps
even asking that stuff destined for 2.6.x+1 go into a -next branch
and the more devel quality stuff go into a -mm branch that is based
off of their -next branch.  Gradually stuff would move from -mm
to -next, getting constantly integrated against other peoples' stuff.
More disruptive changes could go in and gradually as people rebase their
trees the conflicts would hopefully get less painful.
But, let's see how things go.
