USB may have problems but on my test sets with 2.5.of those that booted,
the scsi ones are pretty stable, the IDE ones eat disks or hang (mostly
hang). USB loaded on some of the IDE boxes, the SCSI test boxes dont
have USB.
I've not tried the forward port of the stable IDE code with the test
loads. My SMP 2.5.27 test set on 2.5.27-ac1 (all the bits of which are
in 2.5.29) with symbios scsi on a dual PPro has been running for 6 days.
