Well, I am tracking Alex's svn. It is for off-the-tree builds. I 
reorganized Alex's code in Oct 2006 and added
a patch to my debian/patches. Until debian shipped linux-2.6.20, there 
were no [tifm_*] in their tree, so no conflicts. The 2.6.20 came with 
tifm_sd-v0.6 which is not so stable. I dug lkml and bugzilla.kernel.org 
for fresh patches, but found 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8052.
 Which made me think, 
svn is still unstable. I merged in-kernel updates to my old (v2.6.18-*) 
version. It compiles and runs OK, so I posted it. No offense to anyone.
Best regards,
Sergey
