Eh, it definitely does, in nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/getpid.c:
	pid_t result = THREAD_GETMEM (THREAD_SELF, pid);
	if (__builtin_expect (result <= 0, 0))
	  result = really_getpid (result);
A few places, including the fork code, fix it:
	/* Adjust the PID field for the new process.  */
	THREAD_SETMEM (self, pid, THREAD_GETMEM (self, tid));
But not direct calls to clone(2).
