Your syscalls blindly dereference userspace pointers instead of using
copy_{to,from} user.
Why did you split all your syscalls into two functions?
s/__FUNCTION__/__func__/
s/antennas/antennae/
You seem to have added debugging messages mentioning 'serial8250' into
serial_core.h
You added <linux/pps.h> with #ifdef __KERNEL__ in it, but didn't export
it to userspace. Why?
Your structures for userspace communication look OK -- I don't think you
need special 32/64 compatibility for them. You do need it for the
'struct timespec' in sys_time_pps_fetch() though.
Must we have the ioctl-like interface to sys_time_pps_cmd()? If the
second argument is always 'struct pps_source_data_s *', why does the
syscall pretend it's 'void *'?
