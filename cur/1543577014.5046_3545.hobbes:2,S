Please, and I'll ask Rik to post them on the kernelnewbies.org patch
page.  (Rik?)  Putting bitmaps and group descriptors into the page cache
will allow the current adhoc bitmap and groupdesc caching code to be
deleted - the for-real cache should have better lru, be more efficient
to access, not need special locking and won't have an arbitrary limit on
number of cached bitmaps.  About 300 lines of spagetti gone.  I suppose
the group descriptor pages still need to be locked in memory so we can
address them through a table instead of searching the hash.  OK, this
must be what you meant by a 'proper' fix to the ialloc group desc bug I
posted last month, which by the way is *still* there.  How about
applying my patch in the interim?  It's a real bug, it just doesn't
trigger often.

It would be awfully nice to have those patches available via ftp. 
Web-based mail archives don't make it because you can't generally can't
get the patches out intact - the tabs get expanded and other noise
inserted.
