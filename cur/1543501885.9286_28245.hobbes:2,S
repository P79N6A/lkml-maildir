maybe it's different for mixing it with pure C like 
in this special case, but -
until now I thought (and experienced) exactly the opposite.
C++ is imho especially perfect to maintain bigger projects and
was designed for this. to make programmers life easier in bigger
projects and development teams. in a well designed C++ project you
are actually forced to do the right thing (e.g. use inherited 
objects in the right way - and yes, use the overload feature 
to simply add features to an inherited object works great 
and does not confuse at all, if you are using it in the 
right way...).
so do you really think C++ (and OOP in general) is a 
retrogression compared to C ??
again this might be a more complex problem in the special case,
but I just couldn't resist to repond to this general statement above.
maybe it was a little bit off topic as well, so sorry...
