   1. When I compiled IPv6 INSIDE the kernel, the kernel crashes at startup.
Can you please send a ksymoops processed OOPS log of
the crash?
Without this information, the bug cannot be fixed.
   2. So, I compiled IPv6 as a modules, so when I insmod ipv6, I get
   unresolved symbol error messages.
Can you show the list of these unresolved symbols?
All together now:  "Without this information, the bug cannot be
fixed."
Thanks.
Later,
