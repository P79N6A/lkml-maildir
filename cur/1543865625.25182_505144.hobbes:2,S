Hi all,
First step for a memory controller : a sane pages accounting
for a group of tasks.
Based on top of the last multi-hierarchy generic containers
patch, against 2.6.20-rc1 sent by P.Menage (Fri, 22 Dec).
Patch[1,4] is a back port of the last set of patches sent by
Balbir (Fri, 10 Nov) + fixes.
In patch5, accounting is like a reference count per page (by
comparison with the CKRM accounting based on page allocation).
Only "user pages" (ie private and shared pages for tasks with
a struct mm) are currently under consideration.
Patrick
