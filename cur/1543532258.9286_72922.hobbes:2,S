this does _NOT_ work at least for my DFI K6BV3+ bios dated 08/05/99 
(still the most recent one when I checked their web page 2+ weeks ago).
from german DFI support I got a bios version 12/xx/99 (can't remmeber exactly)
which is ok for 40GB disks, and I haven't found any new problems 
with that version yet (cross fingers;).
