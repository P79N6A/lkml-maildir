Subject: [PATCH] compile fix for MPT Fusion driver for 2.5.70 bk
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/5/107

The patch below fixes compilation for the MPT Fusion driver, which broke 
with recent changes to the PCI API.
It seems that the code is trying to detect which version of the API its 
being compiled for, but the macro it was looking for has disappeared.
