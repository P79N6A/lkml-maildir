I'm afraid I don't understand the problem described here, when
ALSA can assign any arbitrary index number of a user's choice
to cards that are detected.
Indeed, on my system (an A8V Deluxe motherboard, with this
quirk active), my first soundcard (given index=0) is an offboard
Creative SB Live, and the onboard card I have assigned index=1.
I for one need this quirk to get both soundcards at all (which
I need) -- no matter what indexing order.

This one can be disabled separate of the AC97 -- let me get back
on that.  I, for one (however much that is), don't need it either.
