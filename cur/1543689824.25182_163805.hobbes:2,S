After discussion with Paul Cassella and some more experimentation
on my side, I've concluded that this is not a Linux kernel issue
at all -- it's a "feature" of fvwm.  Specifically, fvwm grabs the
entire X server when it's doing a non-opaque move, and xmms only
keeps playing music until its buffer is drained.  The xmms buffer
size seems to be dramatically smaller under ALSA, which is why I
never saw the problem until I moved to 2.6.0-test4 and ALSA.
I've changed "OpaqueMoveSize" in my .fvwm2rc file to 90, so it will
only use outline-mode for moving windows which are 90% of the size
of the screen -- i.e. never, for me.  (Another workaround might be
to increase xmms's buffer size, but I haven't pursued that side yet.)

 is also
relevant here.
