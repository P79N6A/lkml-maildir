It's because of the sequence of events.  Currently, driver unload
sequence is the same as when the device is hot unplugged.  libata
detects that the device is gone and disables it and report it to SCSI
layer.  SCSI layer takes over and tries to kill the SCSI device and tell
sd to shutdown and sd issues START_STOP to shutdown which fails w/
DID_BAD_TARGET because the matching ATA device is already gone.  I've
left it that way because I'm not sure whether spinning down the drive on
driver unload is the correct thing to do.  The message is annoying tho.
Thanks.
