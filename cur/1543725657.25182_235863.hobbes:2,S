I use cryptoloop and I would be really annoyed if it disappeared in
the stable kernel series. Besides, I read in another mail in this thread 
that dm-crypt will not work with file-based storage (I'm using 
cryptoloop on a file), and that it is new and potentially buggy.
I'm really surprised that people here argue that dm-crypt doesn't get 
enough testing so cryptoloop has to go to force people to test dm-crypt 
with their valuable data. This is all upside-down. First dm-crypt has to 
be stable, safe and feature-complete, then people can convert their data 
to dm-crypt and only then can cryptoloop be deleted.
