Subject: [PATCH 02/15] ACPI: delete include/acpi/platform/
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/31/68

From: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>
The ACPICA tree has some additional non-Linux files in this dir,
but Linux doesn't bother with those, so keep things simple...
