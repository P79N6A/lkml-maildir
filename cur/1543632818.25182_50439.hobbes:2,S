Subject: [PATCH] Allow jffs2/super.c to build
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, lkml, dwmw2,
  Note: This is not in the MTD CVS (I'm not clear on David's handling
        of 2.5 MTD)
The following patch adds <linux/namei.h> which seems to be required to
allow fs/jffs2 to build in 2.5.20.  This fixes all the following
warnings/errors:
super.c: In function `jffs2_get_sb':
super.c:197: storage size of `nd' isn't known
super.c:245: warning: implicit declaration of function `path_lookup'
super.c:245: `LOOKUP_FOLLOW' undeclared (first use in this function)
super.c:245: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
super.c:245: for each function it appears in.)
super.c:254: warning: implicit declaration of function `path_release'
super.c:197: warning: unused variable `nd'
