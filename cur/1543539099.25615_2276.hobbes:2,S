	ARIN is notouriously bad for maintaining contact info. As a result when you 
try to complain about SPAM you hit the wall. Contact addresses are invalid, 
tech-handles point to nowhere. Even contacts for AS maintainers are invalid. 
This is for the entire asia-pacific region or at least for every single SPAM I 
got from there (I take the time to complain and including all the way to the 
upstream ISP if necessary on most of the B.S. I recieve).
	As a result you never get through the first phase required by RBL and other 
blacklists and no-one will waste a fortune on a "support" phone call to Japan 
or China to comply with the further phases listed in RBL guidelines. As a 
result SPAM in Japan, China and Korea goes on and they never get into RBL.
	So, no matter how ugly does it seem I agree that filtering based on charset 
is a good idea.
And this got way OT, omho. It is more of a subject for nanog or rbl discussion 
lists ;-)
