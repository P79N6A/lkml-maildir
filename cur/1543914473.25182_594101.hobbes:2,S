No, each reserve user comes with a bean-counter that will limit the
usage.

when you have dirty file backed pages, the rest of the memory can only
consists of clean file pages and or anonymous pages - due to the dirty
limit. If you can guarantee that swap doesn't use memory (well, it does,
but its PF_MEMALLOC memory that cannot be used by others) then you can
always free memory by dropping clean pages or swapping out. And thus
make progress for file based writeback.
This is why the dirty page tracking made mmap over NFS useable.

No, networking will beancount all PF_MEMALLOC memory it receives, and
stop allocating once it hits it limit. It knows that when it has than
much memory outstanding its guaranteed memory will be freed soon.

Ok, so next time I'll post the whole series again - I know some people
found it too much - but that way you can see the bean counter.
