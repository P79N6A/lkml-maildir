	Given that it's David's driver and he pretty much has the
   final word on the Sparc port anyway; it's obviously up to him.  Me,
   I'd be happy with whatever makes it work with a stock kernel, not
   having to modify it every time we upgrade to a newer version.
Jakub is co-maintainer of the Sparc port, so his word is to be
taken about as heavily as mine most of the time :-)
I'm going to make it use PIO to download the firmware always,
but for 2.2.15, 2.2.14 is too close.
Later,
