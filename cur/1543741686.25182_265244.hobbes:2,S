This has been discussed a bit on linux-pm (on osdl lists, it's a new
list to discuss PM specific matters). I tend to think the core should
know at least a few "standard" things like P2P bridges, by simply
saving/restoring a bigger chunk of config space. We also need to fix the
current restore code I suppose, so that it disables IO & MEM, then
restore all registers, then re-enable those 2 ones...
I don't want to cross-post between lists, but people are welcome to join
linux-pm to talk about implementation issues related to power
management, including the changes we are trying to define to the various
driver callbacks.
