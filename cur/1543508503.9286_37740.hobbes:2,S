Hi,
I've found a bug in kernel/signal.c, which causes unkillable processes,
increasing load by 1 for each instance of such process.
When process is exiting, it's state is changed to TASK_ZOMBIE in
do_exit(). After this, signals are sent to the parent process and
to the actual process group. We made some changes to the signal
delivering code, which contained re-scheduling. After return into
do_exit(), current process had TASK_RUNNING set, because of queued
signals. This caused infinite loop. I understand that this is my fault
(due to rescheduling), but I noticed such tasks on server running original
kernel (2.2.9, 2.2.10) sometimes - it's heavy loaded server and many users
are doing many things there, which may cause re-scheduling after
state-change at places, where author assumed that state of process will
remain unchanged.
This have to be true for the zombies, so I propose following patch
to the kernel/signal.c:
--- signal.c.orig	Tue Sep  7 17:23:50 1999
+++ signal.c	Tue Sep  7 17:25:22 1999

 	/* The somewhat baroque permissions check... */
 	ret = -EPERM;
 	if ((!info || ((unsigned long)info != 1 && SI_FROMUSER(info)))
Let me know, if I got it wrong.
Thanks,
