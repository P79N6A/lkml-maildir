In reality, yes.
However BIOS programmers have a different perception of reality to the rest of us.
The spec for PST tables allows for up to 256 FID/VID pairs, yet everyone just
seems to offer 5-6 as maximum. I guess they figured no-one needed the granularity
of the full range.

Something that has been planned for quite a while has been a means of overriding
the tables using sysfs. I haven't had time to implement this, and no-one else
has found the time/motivation to do so either it seems.
Something I was tempted to do at one point (due to the number of broken PST's out
there) was to offer a 'ignore_pst' module parameter, which exposed the full table
to sysfs. The only problem being some VRMs can't handle certain frequencies at
certain voltages whilst some can, making it hard to find a set of 'safe' values
for each frequency.
How to find out which one VRM can handle frequency X at voltage Y ?
Through the PST tables.
*sigh*, back to the drawing board.
