Subject: total_RAM global for ramdisk size = 1/2 RAM

I think this one may well be worth doing. I don't think the actual code I
did it with is likely to be acceptable. I changed some stuff so the size
of ramdisks is one half the size of total RAM on the box. The way I do it
here this involved a computation of total ram in init/main.c, a divide by
two of that value in drivers/block/rd.c, and a declaration of a global in
a header file common to those two, for which I used init.h. 
I declare total_RAM in linux/init.h, compute it in start_kernel() in
init/main.c, and take 1/2 of it for what was rd_size in drivers/block/rd.c. 
As it is I get one cast warning, and it works. I get a 14meg ramdisk on
a 32 meg box. I compiled a 1.0.9 kernel on that 14meg ramdisk. It wasn't
noticably faster than on an old SCSI drive. My primary interest in this
survives though, due to the installation possibilities created by very
large ramdisks that size themselves sensibly to the box. I'll be using
this.
The kernel using this hack is 2.2pre5. 
Also, in my haste, I think this breaks the commandline control of
ramdisk_size . I don't use rd_size at all in this example. Note that
rd_size was in effect an upper size limit on ramdisks for
straight-from-floppy kernels. My first post to this list was about that.
Since I doubt my code is remotely suitable, I didn't bother with a
systematic patch, just some plain cut/paste outtakes showing what I did.
Look for total_RAM for what I changed. And a few other lines.
BTW, the rdev manpage needs attention. Unless it's been updated.

/*
 * ramdisk.c - Multiple RAM disk driver - gzip-loading version - v. 0.8 beta.
 * 
 * (C) Chad Page, Theodore Ts'o, et. al, 1995. 
 *
 * This RAM disk is designed to have filesystems created on it and mounted
 * just like a regular floppy disk.  
 *  
 * It also does something suggested by Linus: use the buffer cache as the
 * RAM disk data.  This makes it possible to dynamically allocate the RAM disk
 * buffer - with some consequences I have to deal with as I write this. 
 * 
 * This code is based on the original ramdisk.c, written mostly by
 * Theodore Ts'o (TYT) in 1991.  The code was largely rewritten by
 * Chad Page to use the buffer cache to store the RAM disk data in
 * 1995; Theodore then took over the driver again, and cleaned it up
 * for inclusion in the mainline kernel.
 *
 * The original CRAMDISK code was written by Richard Lyons, and
 * adapted by Chad Page to use the new RAM disk interface.  Theodore
 * Ts'o rewrote it so that both the compressed RAM disk loader and the
 * kernel decompressor uses the same inflate.c codebase.  The RAM disk
 * loader now also loads into a dynamic (buffer cache based) RAM disk,
 * not the old static RAM disk.  Support for the old static RAM disk has
 * been completely removed.
 *
 * Loadable module support added by Tom Dyas.
 *
 * Further cleanups by Chad Page (page0588@sundance.sjsu.edu):
 *	Cosmetic changes in #ifdef MODULE, code movement, etc.
 * 	When the RAM disk module is removed, free the protected buffers
 * 	Default RAM disk size changed to 2.88 MB
 *
 *  Added initrd: Werner Almesberger & Hans Lermen, Feb '96
 *
* 4/25/96 : Made RAM disk size a parameter (default is now 4 MB) 
 *		- Chad Page
 *######  this is not a default, it is a MAXIMUM ###########
 * Add support for fs images split across >1 disk, Paul Gortmaker, Mar '98
