Resource management is about managing (scarce) resources. Virtual
memory is scarce. And me confusing virtual and physical memory for a
moment prompted me to make this suggestion. 
Reasons that I can come up with right now:
- It has an educational effect. (It tells people where their 3G kernel
  virtual addressing space went, it explains why you should use mem=960M
  instead of mem=1024M if you have 1G of RAM.)
- ioremap & vmalloc are parcelling out a resource, that nicely fits the 
  model. 
We, in effect, have two special purpose allocators that allocate from
this resource, and we've statically allocated their domains. I don't
think that there is a pressing argument to say that we "need" this
right now, but it would be nice to make things fit into the "scheme of
things".
Not convinced? Oh well, at least you straightened me out....  ;-)
