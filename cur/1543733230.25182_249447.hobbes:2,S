You also have some duplicated code in one function, which implies that
you didn't test this patch (it's in the updated patch you sent me too) :)

I thought you only wanted the ability to actually find the different
class devices.  Then the code would take it from there.  Not this
complex driver core linking logic that you implemented.

Exactly.  Why don't you all use that instead?
