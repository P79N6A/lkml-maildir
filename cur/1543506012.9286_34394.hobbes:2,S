Subject: User space device driver?

I'd like to write a device driver that passes all open/close/ioctls
to a user space program that can deliver arbitrary results.
Questions:
1. Has somebody already done this?
2. What's the best user-kernel communication method?
3. If the answer is AF_NETLINK can anyone point me to example code
   or documentation?
Why?
vmware virtual device to file image support
mouse multiplexing (maybe gpmdata is better...)
testing
