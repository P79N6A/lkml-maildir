Just note vma->vm_page_prot before calling the ->mmap and check after.
If the driver has messed with it at all, it's not a mapping we want to
apply dirty capping to anyway.  If it's unchanged, and the other tests
pass, go ahead and reset readonly vm_page_prot via protection_map[].
This is of course a hack, as is the pgprotting code from drm.
The correct solution would be to set the proper backing_dev_info
in a number of drivers - we were too lazy when setting the default
in the first place; but even if we caught all the intree drivers,
we'd miss out-of-tree ones and suffer unnecessary pain from them.
So for now a hack is necessary, and I haven't thought of a better.
