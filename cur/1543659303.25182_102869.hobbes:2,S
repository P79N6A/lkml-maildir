Actually Edsger Dijkstra wrote a paper entitled "Goto considered Harmful"
He never called them evil.  And the title was more for shock value to
grab peoples attention.  For the beginners Dijkstra did not
distinguish between goto, break, return, and continue.
You can find many of his papers at:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/
What he was after was simple and maintainable code, and from
everything I have read, I think he would have no major problems with
the Linux kernel code. 
In the category of maintainability, and simplicity Dijkstra made
certain the first hardware implementation of an interrupt handler he
worked with had the ability to completely save the interrupt state so
he could later return to the interrupted code.  To make writing to a
printer a non-realtime task he invented the semaphore.

Linus I think if he was alive you would have enjoyed talking to him,
your view points seem to mesh quite well.

Now that is something worth criticizing! 
Though standard Pascal was not unusable because of the lack of a goto,  
that was the one feature it actually had.  But I suspect a lot of
teachers failed to mention it.

Well you seem to be coping well.  Just a little Pascal phobia there...
