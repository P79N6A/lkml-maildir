You can.  Make sure that all mounts use the "sync" flag in /etc/fstab.
You need to remember that unix systems are designed to be in a stable
environment, and enable optimizations that rely on those conditions.  That
way, it can do more work in RAM which is faster than the disks.
If you expect to be in unstable conditions, you should take the speed hit,
and enable the sync flag.
Also remember, XFS, JFS, ReiserFS, and especially EXT3 take steps to do the
work for you without requiring the sync flag.
