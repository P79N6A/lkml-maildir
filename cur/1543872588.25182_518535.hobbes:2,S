It's the same old problem: the race between unbind and sysfs I/O.  What
good does holding a reference to the private data structure do if the
show/store method gets called after the driver has been unbound from the
device?  dev_get_drvdata() will no longer provide a valid pointer to the
private data, so the method will have no way to access it.  Hence the
method needs another argument.
(BTW, the sysfs core would actually need more than a kref.  It would also 
need a pointer to a release routine -- the kref contains only the atomic 
counter.  The more you think about it, the more complicated this approach 
becomes.)

Not quite right.  However, since every open sysfs file holds a module
reference, if the driver's module_exit has been called then there can be
no open sysfs files, hence no private data still pinned.  Thus this isn't
a problem at all.
But never mind all the above.  I'm going to post another message on this
thread in which I argue that Oliver's original approach was a good one and
should not have been reverted.  The specific problem identified by Hugh
Dickins can be fixed in the way Dmitry first suggested, by doing the real
operation from a workqueue routine.
