Comments are not useful to the assembler, it doesn't look at it ;)
So being removed by cpp or by the assembler itself does not matter for me.
GAS support C style comment and there's an option to cpp to keep comment
if you want comment in the assembler listing.
The preprocessor is 'just a kind of filter', you can preprocess your
files through m4, sed, perl, etc ... what's the problem with that ?
