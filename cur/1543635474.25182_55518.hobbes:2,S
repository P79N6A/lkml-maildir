Why was the rate incremented to maintain interactive performance?  Wasn't
that the whole idea of the pre-empt work?  Does the burden of pre-empt
actually require this?
It seems that the added inefficiency of these extra interrupts is going to
drag performance down.

} Yes, RedHat's current devel kernel is using HZ=1000.  I am not sure how
