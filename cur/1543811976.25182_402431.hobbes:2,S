"DriveStatusError" is "Command Aborted" in ac-speak.
 From the man page for smartctl, we read:

There's a chance that your drives simply do not fully support this feature,
and are rejecting attempts to use it.
By the way, the latest 2.6.16-rc5-git4 is available,
and has FUA turned off by default now.  So it should
work with your drives, and *you* are expected to verify
that for us all now.
Cheers
