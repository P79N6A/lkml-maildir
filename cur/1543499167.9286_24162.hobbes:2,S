Disclaimer: I haven't looked at the actual devfs code, but considering
that there must have been one longish linux-kernel thread carefully
dissecting every single line of it by now, I've worked up enough
confidence to voice my opinion anyway ;-)

I think Ted disagrees with devfs making choices like lumping all the,
say, IDE CD drivers together, instead of separating them by IDE bus.
I guess the real question is whether classifying things by their
purpose (e.g. "disk") instead of their attachment (e.g. ide0/master or
isa/busmouse) adds any significant complexity or ambiguity. I think in
almost every case the classification is already done elsewhere, so it
probably isn't too much of a problem.

Actually, with devfsd, wouldn't it be easier to have a configuration
file with a set of rules, a bit like what /dev/MAKEDEV has, but perhaps
more like a set of chmods executed in sequence, so that you can have
layered defaults ? E.g.
perm root sys  600 * */* */*/*
perm root sys  666 null zero full
perm root disk 660 */disk/*
...
Then simply refuse any direct chown/chmod by the user. Once people are
used to it, they may actually like it better.
Sorry if I'm re-iterating some thread long ago burried.

Although you bring this up in almost every posting in devfs, I'm not so
sure if this is really an essential feature. It's nice, though.
