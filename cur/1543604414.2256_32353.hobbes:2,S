Hmm.  There is a fixed ration of the amount of virtual address space
with each user space process having 3GB of virutal address space and
the kernel having 1GB.
But since the kernel implements paging the kernel can use all of the
RAM in the system.  While often times user space applications don't
haven't implemented the logic to use it all.
So for a good answer we need to know your application and why it is a
concern.
