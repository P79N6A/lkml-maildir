It says clearly in the code where to start. See the FIXME notes in both
libata-sff and libata-core about MMIO. Neither the DMA transfer start or
the probe SRST sequence are correct with MMIO posting and this hasn't
been fixed as I pointed out was needed when I originally NAKked the
change.
Without those being fixed (especially SRST) on any device with heavy PCI
posting of mmio your controller *wont work*.
