Machine in question is XP2500+@1.84GHz (it was overlocked@2.25GHz during 
last test, now running at
official speed). Is this really slow for 1ms?
Applied your patch. Booted.
With preempt_thresh=1 I still got tons of those violations at schedule().
With preempt_thresh=2 I do not get those anymore. Apart from sys_ioctl() 
violation, getting now these:
16ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at exit_notify+0x1d/0x7b0 and ending at schedule+0x291/0x480
7ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at kmap_atomic+0x13/0x70 and ending at kunmap_atomic+0x5/0x20
6ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at fget+0x28/0x70 and ending at fget+0x41/0x70
No apparent side-effects noticed.
As before, when running mplayer I'm getting many sys_ioctl() things 
coupled with messages:
rtc: lost some interrupts at 1024Hz.
It happens when madly seeking around in video.
