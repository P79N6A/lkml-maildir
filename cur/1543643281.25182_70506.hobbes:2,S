   Well, a bridge can also just _bridge_ ARP packets between two sides of the 
   bridge. The ARP module can filter out those packets. These packets will not 
   pass through the ARP code of the Linux kernel. Ofcourse, the ebtables ARP 
   module can be easily adjusted for arptables
No, I think I understand the difference and why you're problem
space does not intersect what arptables handles.
It may not be nice that we can't immediately just reuse ipv4/netfilter
handlers for bridging, but I'm not going to require that you make that
work before I'll accept your patch.
Once you work things out with Lennert and he approves the changes,
I'll apply your patch.
