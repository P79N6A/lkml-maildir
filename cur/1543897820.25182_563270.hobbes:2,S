I have ICE1724, a very good sound card to my taste, works like a charm. But 
with ALSA I had a really hard time to configure it properly, wanna see 
my .asoundrc? And I am not sure I have done it right (== the best possible 
way). I have read everything on 
http://www.alsa-project.org/documentation.php
 
about .asoundrc. When I am using Skype I have to rename .asoundrc to 
something else in order to get it working. When I am doing some changes 
to .asoundrc I have to restart the app. Is there a tool which can be used to 
configure .asoundrc? I want to be able to hear sound from flashplayer on my 
reciever or in my headphones -- how? It's not quite clear to me how to get 
full duplex working with my .asoundrc.
