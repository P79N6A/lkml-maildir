Subject: [patch 0/2] IRDA: convert nsc-ircc to the new PM scheme

Hi,
This is an attempt to move nsc-ircc driver from pm_register
to the new power management scheme by creating a platform
driver and registering it with sysfs.
I do not have the hardware so it is compiles but that's as
far as I can go. If you happen to have the hardware in question
I'd appreciate giving these patches a spin.
Thank you.
