answering n for all that, I note the build, at the end of the make bzImage,
spits out this:
  MODPOST vmlinux
WARNING: arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x845d): Section mismatch:

But then proceeds with the make modules stage.  I believe I've seen references
to this in other threads.  Is It Serious?
