I have. All it does is change how much space the kernel
allocates to spinlocks and some other structures. This is
merely an optimisation primarily for SMP. This does not
prevent code from executing correctly on CPUs having a
different actual L1 cache line size.

No. You're over-interpreting X86_GENERIC. All it does is
change some optimisation defaults. It is not required for
correctness.
