It won't unless you have a backup program that takes care of it for you.
The only safe way to backup VFAT is to use the program on the Win98 CD
that will get rid of all of the long file names, storing the LFN->SFN
mapping in a file in each directory.  Then you have a plain 8.3
filesystem that any backup program can handle.  After you restore, you
run the program that reads the special file and rebuilds the LFN->SFN
mappings in the directory entries.
That's why using "copy" or "xcopy" under DOS/Windows can screw things
up; they don't make sure the LFN still maps to the same 8.3 filename.
And the registry stores the LFN in some places and the 8.3 name in other
places, so they have to stay the same or you are forever lost.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
