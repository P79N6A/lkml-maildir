Hi,
I ran into the same thing a month ago. I talked to Andi Kleen about this.
He seems to think that, it is okay to modify the sg-list in pci_map_sg().
pci_unmap_sg() can't restore it back, since we lost lot of information.
One option is to recreate entire sg-list in case of a retry. I used a patch 
similar to following to do this. Is this acceptable ?
Thanks,
Badari
