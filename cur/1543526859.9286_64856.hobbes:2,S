the problem is that for a period of time the computers will be operating
with a completely different security behaviour as compared to it's
normal operational behaviour. Assumptions/expections regarding security
may not be valid during boot-up, and that's a security risk.
i can't think of something specific, but i am not a security expert.
Perhaps someone can, especially considering that Trusted mode security
setups are often going to be multi-user boxes with legitimate but
potentially hostile interactive users.
IMO if the box boots in traditional unix security mode, then it can
not later be considered to be a trusted host. 
Either it's installed as Trusted, and then always runs in Trusted mode,
or it's not a trusted setup. (not sure, but i think this a requirement
for many security certifications like C2 - ie singleuser/allprivs mode
is not allowed)
