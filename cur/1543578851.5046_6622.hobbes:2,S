That's a possible solution; I'm not clear how bad the overhead would be.
Right now a virtual alias is a relativly rare event and we don't want the
common case of no virtual alias to make pay a high price.  Or?

An alternative but less efficient solution.  I tried to implement it; I ran
into problems with running out of larger pages soon as I had to split order 2
pages into 4 order 0 pages to implement this; the fragmentation was _really_
bad.

You leave only mappings of one color accessible.  All other mappings are made
unaccessible in the page table, so accessing will result in a TLB fault.
The TLB fault handler then flushes the active mappings, makes them
unaccessible by clearing the MIPS hw dirty / accessible bits, then makes the
mapping of the new color accessible in the page table.  This is already
possible right now but doing the necessary reverse mappings can be rather
inefficient as is.

Which is exactly what many MIPS implementations are suffering from.  At
least they're tagged with the physical address, so no flushes on context
switch necessary.
