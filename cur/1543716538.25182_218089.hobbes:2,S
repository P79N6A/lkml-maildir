Once you've digested Andrew's query as to whether there is a simpler way
to do this, and know whether it's this patch or some other that you want
to push, then if you send me a patch, ideally including the printk's in
fs/binfmt_elf.c that Reiser thought might facilitate debugging, then I'd
be willing to apply the patch and try booting it on my ia64 SN2 hardware.
