For userspace that wants to do that (that is, having iocbs signaled to an 
eventfd), do not really matter much. They have their own iocb setup function
and they'd simply set a flag more and set the resfd.
The global setting may be good for some users, with others that may 
complain in having to create another ctx just to set an fd.
Again, IMO is not worth a new API. What do other folks think?
