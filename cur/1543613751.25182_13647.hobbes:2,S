I haven't taken the time to track down what's causing all the context 
switches, but on my system they are indeed "normal".  I suspect large 
numbers of them are a result of interactions between gnome, nautilus, X, 
xmms, esd, and gnome-xmms.  However, I did just track down one reason for 
it.  It's not 8300 - 8800, its 830 - 880.  There appears to be a bug in the 
procinfo -n1 mode that results in an extra digit getting tacked onto the end 
of the context switch line.  So, take my original numbers and lop off the 
last digit from the context switch numbers and that's more like what the 
machine is actually doing.
