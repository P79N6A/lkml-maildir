It's strange if you can.  My mount (fairly recent) looks in fstab to
determine whether a user should be allowed to mount a device.
However, when unmounting it checks /etc/mtab to make sure it was you
who mounted it in the first place, making it impossible to unmount
someone else's cdrom.  If you use the 'users' (note the 's') option
instead any user can mount or unmount the device at any time, mtab
being ignored.
