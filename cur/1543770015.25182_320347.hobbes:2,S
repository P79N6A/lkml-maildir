updated patch below.
--
this patch (ontop of the current -mm scheduler patchset) tweaks 
cpu_idle() semantics a bit: it changes the idle loops (that do 
preemption) to call the first schedule() unconditionally.
the advantage is that as a result we dont have to set the idle thread's 
NEED_RESCHED flag in init_idle(), which in turn makes cond_resched() 
even more of an invariant: it can be called even from init code without 
it having any effect. A cond resched in the init codepath hangs 
otherwise.
this patch, while having no negative side-effects, enables wider use of 
cond_resched()s. (which might happen in the stock kernel too, but it's 
particulary important for voluntary-preempt) (note that for now this 
patch only covers architectures that use kernel/Kconfig.preempt, but all 
other architectures will work just fine too.)
