   That case shouldn't be a problem, since when your device get discovered,
   hopefully, the host controller is already there. Though in some cases,
   host controllers just appear as a sibling device, and in this specific
   case, it may be not have been "discovered" yet.
THat's not what I'm concerned about, what I care about is that there
still will be a pci_find_*() I can call to see if DEV/ID is on
the bus.  That is the easiest way to perform that search right
now.
