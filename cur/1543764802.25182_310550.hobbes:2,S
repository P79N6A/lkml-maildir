Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 11, 2005 at 01:14:57AM CEST, I got a letter

Well, except that from purely technical standpoint commit-tree has
nothing to do in this picture - it creates new object in the git
filesystem based on its input data, but regardless to the directory
cache or current tree. It probably still belongs where it is from the
workflow standpoint, though.

You can take mine, and do:
	git pull pasky
	git pull linus
	cp .dircache/HEAD .dircache/HEAD.local
Now, your tree and git filesystem is up to date.
	git track local
Now, when you do git pull pasky, your working tree will not be updated
automatically anymore.
	git track linus
Now, you start tracking Linus' tree instead. Note that the initial
update will blow away the scripts in your current tree, so before you do
the last two steps you will probably want to clone the tree and set PATH
to the one still tracking me, so you get all the comfort. ;-)

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
