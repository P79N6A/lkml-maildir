Just before trying to return to userspace, we have a stack:
        user_regs [ebx ... es]
        orig_eax
        user_iret_frame [eip ... oldss]
After RESTORE_ALL and discarding orig_eax, we have this just
before doing iret (user's regs are in the CPU regs now):
        user_iret_frame [eip ... oldss]
iret faults and we get:
        kernel_iret_frame [eip(of iret) ... flags]
        user_iret_frame [eip ... oldss]
error_code then saves regs and we have:
        user_regs [ebx ... es]
        orig_eax [== -1]
        kernel_iret_frame [eip(iret) ... flags]
        user_iret_frame [eip ... oldss]
error_code then calls e.g. do_segment_not_present, which finds a fixup
and does:
        regs->eip = fixup_address;
now we have:
        user_regs [ebx ... es]
        orig_eax [== -1]
        kernel_iret_frame [eip(fixup) ... flags]
        user_iret_frame [eip ... oldss]
standard return sequence gives us (again user's regs are back in CPU):
        kernel_iret_frame [eip(fixup) ... flags]
        user_iret_frame [eip ... oldss]
iret returns to the fixup code which jumps to error_code and then we have:
        user_regs [ebx ... es]
        orig_eax [== -1]
        user_iret_frame [eip ... oldss]
So now there is a stack frame that looks like it came from userspace
and we call the iret fault handler with that.
Only problem I have with this is we lose the original fault info from
the iret.  So we have no real way of knowing whether it was #GP, #NP, #SF
or whatever, and no record of the offending iret's address.
