Both of my 2.4.23 boxes reports excessive size-64 objects 
1) on my 512MB box, it's  3176370 3176442     64 53838 53838    1 
2) on my 128MB box, it's  1223329 1223365     64 20735 20735	1
Is this really normal? Both boxes have been up for 2 days, but the 128MB
box is starting to show signs of getting slower and slower the more the
size-64 cache increases.
