Subject: [PATCH 1/2] kernel-doc: drop leading space in sections
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/20/6

From: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@xenotime.net>
Drop leading space of kernel-doc section contents.
"Section" data (contents) are split from the section header
(e.g., Note: below is a section header:
 * Note: list_empty on entry does not return true after this, the entry is
 * in an undefined state.
).
Currently the data/contents begins with a space and is left
that way, which causes it to look bad when printed (in text mode;
see example below), so just remove the leading space.
Note:
 list_empty on entry does not return true after this, the entry is
in an undefined state.
