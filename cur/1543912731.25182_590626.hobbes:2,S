Thanks Roland.
Yes, that is what I was worrying about.

Yes, I also thought about something like this, but tried to avoid because
it adds some complications. OTOH, this is not the fast path.
I'll try to think a bit more about this, and update the patch according
to your comments. Looks like we don't need to check SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT
here, we are doing this later anyway.
Thanks!
Oleg.
