How can owner of cb_chan->common.device_node be removed?
It looks like that channels are only allocated (without proper error path) 
and queued into device->common.channels list in
enumerate_dma_channels() in PCI probe callback and no removing at all, only lockless access.
PCI remove callback only calls dma_async_device_unregister() where only
channel's clients are removed.
