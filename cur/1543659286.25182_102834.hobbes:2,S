Hi Russell,

While we are at it: BUG() expects the offending task to be killed
so implementations, which just do a printk() there are
non-conforming.
Code paths which contain BUG() or BUG_ON() usally expect this
code-path to end and just threat the opposite condition to be
true.
A conforming implementation is panic(), if faulting is not that
easy in these architectures, but printk() is just plain wrong.
Mind to get a patch on top of your doing exactly this
modification?

Ingo Oeser
