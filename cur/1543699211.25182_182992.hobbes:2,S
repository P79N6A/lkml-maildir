I don't see why 'all in the kernel' is the best approach, embedded or
otherwise. I believe udev is being written to execute with a minimal
runtime environment. No glibc, or other such beasts.

Can you prove this? tmpfs doesn't seem to take up much space, and given
that only devices that exist will require data structures in both cases,
it seems to me that the issue is a little irrelevant in either case.

Isn't this an argument for udev?

Many of us believe that devfs is 'over-complification'.

True in either case...
