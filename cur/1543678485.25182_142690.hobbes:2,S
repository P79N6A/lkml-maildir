Hi,
I tried that driver with 2.5.73. The synaptics option is gone, so it is
always on by default? No way to turn it off?
My XF86Config-4 is:
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse1"
        Driver      "synaptics"
        Option      "Protocol" "event"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/input/event1"
        Option      "Emulate3Buttons" "on"
EndSection
it's debian unstable and hardware is a dell latitude c600 laptop.
the trackpoint (or how it is called?) does not work: nothing happends.
The touchpad is working ok, but the mouse is moving either slow or too
fast. I guess there is a way I can configure that?
a bigger problem is: X froze once, but I could login via network and
kill -9 it. No idea why, there is nothing special in the log file.

so far it's working fine.
btw: I'm used to tip twice on the touchpad to get a left click. 
That doesn't work anymore (I might have stopped a few kernel or 
xfree versions before). Is there a way to enable that again?
Thanks. Regards, Andreas
