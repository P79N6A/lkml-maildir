I'll try to take a look sometime next week - or, if I wait until
next Friday, can we expect it to have come down to 9 patches ;-?
I should say, my initial reaction is very much like Andi's last week.
sys_remap_file_pages solves a real problem, but it does so by breaking
lots of rules.  For more than a year after it came in, almost every
development we tried in mm would come up against "but then what do we
do about the nonlinear mappings?".
That has settled down now, but I don't look forward to extending it.
On the other hand, UML does deserve better support.
