We are using CVS to keep track of the Linux kernels.  I am trying to 
solve a problem where split-include clobbers our CVS directory under 
./include/config.  I made a small change to split-include.c that only 
finds files that are header files(.h).   However, I am unsure of the 
history of split-include, and am concerned about possible side effects.
If this change is reasonable, could you consider merging it into future 
kernels.  Attached is a diff -u for the change to split-include.c
Thanks,
Bob Miller
