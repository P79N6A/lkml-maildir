For this, pata_sc1200 and pata_sl82c105:  applied the missing-hook 
portion of the patch, and dropped the ->cable_detect portion pending resend.
Please resend the cable_detect patches one this other stuff lands (will 
push tonight).  I would suggest doing two patches:
	1) add ->cable_detect hook
	2) use ->cable_detect in PATA drivers
There is no need to split up the same change across multiple drivers. 
It is the same logical change, and people doing git-bisect won't be left 
with a broken configuration, so a single update-drivers patch makes more 
sense.  And, hopefully, is less work for you.
