The Linux Test Project test suite <
http://www.linuxtestproject.org
> has
been released. The latest version of the testsuite contains 2000+ tests for
the Linux OS. Our web site also contains other information such as: test
results, a Linux test tools matrix, an area for keeping up with fixes for
known blocking problems in the 2.5/2.6 kernel releases, technical papers
and HowTos on Linux testing, and a code coverage analysis tool.
Highlights:
  * Updated the LTP stress script to use all installed RAM,
    plus 1/2 swap space by default.
  * Improved test case binary compatibility between NPTL
    and Linuxthreads systems.
  * Updated versions of disktest, the Open HPI test suite, and
    the Open POSIX test suite.
  * Applied more bug fixes, patches, and code cleanups.
We encourage the community to post results, patches or new tests on our
mailing list <ltp-list@lists.sf.net> and use the CVS bug tracking facility
to report problems that you might encounter with the test suite.
See ChangeLog below.
