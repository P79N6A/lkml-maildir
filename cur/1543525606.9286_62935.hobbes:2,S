I'm saying it's already a bit bloated for low latency embedded systems, 
compared to a special purpose system designed specifically for that task.

I am not saying anything like that.  The fact is the people before did get the 
locking model right for their time.  Hardware growth and more stress on 
systems progressively bring out new bottlenecks.  It takes years to identify  
and fix those bottlenecks, and many of them can't be foreseen.  Hardware 
growth trends certainly outpace software growth trends, otherwise there 
wouldn't be any problem with OS scaling.

Well what is best for certain classes of machines isn't better for others.  
That will probably always be true.  I take it that your opinion is that Linux 
should target smaller systems.  Personally, I think Linux has a great chance 
of being a big player in the server market, but right now there is a bit of 
catchup to be played to get Linux scaling excellently on this class of 
machines.
> Well, you have chutzpah, I'll give you that.
Well thanks.  Basically, I'm saying is that Linux seems to be at an indecisive 
stage right now.  It isn't clear to me whether it should proceed towards 
embedded systems, single CPU machines, or midrange servers.  I don't know of 
any OS that works well across all of these platforms.  Each has different 
design goals and thus different philosophies that don't mesh well in the same 
source base.  Yet, people are working on getting Linux running well on each of 
these targets and there seems to have been no real discussion about what kind 
of source integration issues that will present.
The last thing I would want to see would be for Linux fall apart because of 
various forces pulling it in different directions.
I may have made several rash points or given poor examples, but this is my 
point in a nutshell.
