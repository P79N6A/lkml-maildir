Subject: [PATCH] locks: fix F_GETLK regression (failure to find conflicts)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/10/584

In 9d6a8c5c213e34c475e72b245a8eb709258e968c we changed posix_test_lock
to modify its single file_lock argument instead of taking separate input
and output arguments.  This makes it no longer safe to set the output
lock's fl_type to F_UNLCK before looking for a conflict, since that
means searching for a conflict against a lock with type F_UNLCK.
This fixes a regression which causes F_GETLK to incorrectly report no
conflict on most filesystems (including any filesystem that doesn't do
its own locking).
Also fix posix_lock_to_flock() to copy the lock type.  This isn't
strictly necessary, since the caller already does this; but it seems
less likely to cause confusion in the future.
Thanks to Doug Chapman for the bug report.
