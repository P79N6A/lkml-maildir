I take back these words. In addition to the fact that this would
introduce more #ifdef noise in .c files, this approach won't work
in cases where we will be reusing existing mutexes as hotcpu_mutexes.
Eg: workqueue_mutex in kernel/workqueue.c and cache_chain_mutex in
mm/slab.c

The patch below implements the latter :)
This patch provides a common interface for all the subsystems to 
lock and unlock their per-subsystem hotcpu mutexes.
When CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is not set, these operations would be no-ops.
