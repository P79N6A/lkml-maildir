Yes, isochornus is wrong.
Just try dict:
  - No definitions found for "isosynchronous"
  - 2 definitions found
    From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) [web1913]:
      Isochronous \I*soch"ro*nous\, a. [Gr. ?; ? equal + ? time.]
	 Same as {Isochronal}.
    From The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (09 FEB 02) [foldoc]:
      isochronous
      
	 <communications> /i:-sok'rn-*s/ A form of data transmission
	 that guarantees to provide a certain minimum {data rate}, as
	 required for time-dependent data such as {video} or {audio}.
      
	 Isochronous transmission transmits asynchronous data over a
	 synchronous data link so that individual characters are only
	 separated by a whole number of bit-length intervals.  This is
	 in contrast to {asynchronous} transmission, in which the
	 characters may be separated by arbitrary intervals, and with
	 {synchronous} transmission [which does what?].
      
	 {Asynchronous Transfer Mode} and {High Performance Serial Bus}
	 can provide isochronous service.
      
	 Compare: {plesiochronous}.
