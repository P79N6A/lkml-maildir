I updated firmware today to F506 (from F502). Same answer as before.
FWIW, the drive doesn't support setcd -command either.

Actually now that I rebooted (for DVD flashing) and started back into
linux, after running dvdspeed it also says:
"scsi: unknown opcode 0xb6" (which is SET_STREAMING). Code for this is
in drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c, and if I read it right, it can't prevent
root from executing that command.
I modified your speed-1.0 to open device O_RDWR, didn't help.
I modified it to also dump_sense after CMD_SEND_PACKET, it's just
duplicate packet.
Thanks.
