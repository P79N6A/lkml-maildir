It uses dmsetup, so it needs the device-mapper. The device-mapper is
integrated into the 2.5/2.6 kernel, but also exists as a patch to the
2.4 kernel (you would probably need to patch the kernel anyway).
You probably want this kernel patch (against 2.4.21):
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/patches-version4/combined-linux-2.4.21-devmapper-ioctl.patch
And then compile the dmsetup tool:
