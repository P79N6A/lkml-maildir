Think in "operations/second" and you get a better view of the disk.

Small chunks means you get better efficiency of memory use - large chunks
mean you may well page in a lot more than you needed to each time (and
cause more paging in turn). Your disk would prefer you fed it big linear
I/O's - 512KB would probably be my first guess at tuning a large box
under load for paging chunk size.
More radically if anyone wants to do real researchy type work - how about
log structured swap with a cleaner  ?
