Hello,
I'm the author of a small C-library (libefs) which implement a
file-system-inside-a-file. The library is in the GNOME CVS tree and is
intended to be used for Bonobo (Gnome compound documents).  Since there
was an at length discussion in this list I would like to invite
everybody interested to help development.  Please send me a mail if you
are interested. My address is: dm@vlsivie.tuwien.ac.at
