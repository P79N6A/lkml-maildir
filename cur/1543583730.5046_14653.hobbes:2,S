Keith,
I do builds in /usr/src/linux, which is a symlink
to /usr/src/linux-akpm.  The recent `mkdep' changes
have broken this practice most horridly.  When searching
.hdepend, `make' doesn't recognise that nested headers
have changed. This is because .hdepend has things like
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/byteorder.h: \
   /usr/src/linux-akpm/include/asm/types.h \
So when it looks for dependencies for
	/usr/src/linux-akpm/include/asm/byteorder.h
it doesn't find anything.  In earlier kernels, the
whole toolchain honoured the symlink form of the name.
The net effect of all this is that changes to included
headers are *not* causing recompiles, and use of a
symlinked $TOPDIR is not feasible.
The workaround at this time is to do a `cd' to the
real $TOPDIR directory before starting development, 
rather than a `cd' to the symlink.
If it is your intention that everything in the
build system use the "real" pathname then I suggest
we need to make it happen consistently.  Or can we
restore the old behaviour?
