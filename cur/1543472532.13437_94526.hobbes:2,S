That would be contradictory to the ninth clause of GPL-2:
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
     of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.
Allowing binary-only distributions is certainly not 'similar in spirit to
the present version', and as such, the new GPL wouldn't be considered as a
GPL as far as GPL-2 is involved.
As far as I can tell.
