Subject: lpr still not working Its NOT VMware related either

I am trying to print, and lpr has stopped working.  It worked in
2.0 kernels and also in 2.2.5, and 2.2.9 I think.
I use ghostscript but I believe I have ruled that out as the
problem, as
both gs works for displaying and
gs -sDEVICE=stcolor -sOutputFile=/dev/lp0 myfle.ps -c quit
also works for printing postscript files.
However if I use
gs -sDEVICE=stcolor -sOutputFile=|lpr  myfile.ps -c quit
it does not work, but it used to work.
The difference is =/dev/lp0 and  =|lpr   which seems that the
pipe to
lpr does not work.
Also If I use ls -l | lpr I get crap on the output a bunch of 0m
and 01m:34 or 01m:32 wrapping the directory listing.  
I blew away my system last night thinking it was vmware and have
reinstalled most of the system FRESH. I tried printing and when
I try to write to lpr it starts shooting out blank paper,
however if I go to the port directly it prints okay. I am not
sure if this is a kernel bug or what, but am looking for any
help.
Any suggestions.. is this configuration or bug?
Joe
