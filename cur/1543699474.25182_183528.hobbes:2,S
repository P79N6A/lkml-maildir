As a nit - It is the person writing and distributing the binary that
determines the symbols used.
In any case, my phrasing was definitely poor.
((Though individual telephone numbers are not copyrightable, arrangements
of telephone numbers are... Or the copyright notice in my phone book is
bogus :-))

I had no real problem with the actual load... Just the distribution of
the binary. To create the binary required access to the kernel sources
just to identify the interfaces. But if the Kernel includes can provide
the required separation... (I don't think they do, because other things are
missing, such as the actual routines).
I don't even have a big problem (other than distaste) to GPL shim modules
for binary drivers. I don't see this as much different than loadable
firmware. At least the shim (if properly written, that is) should be
able to adjust to the various options in a specific kernel build. And I do
have SOME possibility (however remote) to fix a slightly broken shim.
