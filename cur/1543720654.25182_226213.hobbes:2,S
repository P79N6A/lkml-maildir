Does panic switch to a different stack?  If that was the case, you'd
be right and I'd have to make some adjustments.
Or do you mean that at the time of panic, a stack overflow simply
doesn't matter anymore.  The only data that may get corrupted is the
dump for a developer to analyse, after all.  (I'd like to make such a
claim someday, just to hear RAS people scream bloody murder. ;))
