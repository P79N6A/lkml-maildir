Well, if *sectors has no meaning in this context, then there is hadrly
a reason to call ide_end_request either... So I figured rq can be
terminated as below. As for postponing HWIF(drive)->ide_dma_off(drive).
Legitimately terminated commands is hardly a reason for switchinf DMA
off. Most notably DVD-RW units terminate WRITE requests every time
internal buffer gets exhausted, which happens all the time...
Cheers. A.
