Hello Rahul,
No, it havent worked atleast since -test2, because that's when I bought
the new CPU, board and RAM. I'll try to come up with something. This 2.4
is a bit slow with these things, that's why I want to use 2.6, with old
computer there was a noticeable differnce in speed from 2.4 to 2.6. And
for others, I have the patch for nvidia drivers from minion.de. The card
worked _GREAT_ with my old board, untill test2, when I bought my new
board.
Thanks.
