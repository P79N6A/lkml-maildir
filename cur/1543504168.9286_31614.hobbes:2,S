Two nights ago, my nic locked up.  In /var/log/messages I saw this: 
Jul 27 00:53:01 sanctuary kernel: eth0: tx interrupt but no status
I get these all the time on two systems that use the eexpress 16.  It
seems this is "normal" behaviour for this driver.
Jul 27 00:53:11 sanctuary kernel: eth0: CU wedged, status 0040 0000, resetting...
Jul 27 00:53:11 sanctuary kernel: eth0: i82586 reset timed out, kicking...
Jul 27 00:53:11 sanctuary last message repeated 4 times
Jul 27 00:53:11 sanctuary kernel: eth0: i82586 not responding, giving up.
Jul 27 00:53:21 sanctuary kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, board on fire?
<4>eth0: i82586 startup timed out, status 0040, resetting...
etc.
An ifconfig down, ifconfig up resolved the problem.
The card was only recently put in the machine.  It had been running
fine under 2.2.10 for 5 days before this happened.
Any clues?  Anything else I could check to help diagnose the problem?
Ben
