If you have run 2.6.17 to 2.6.17.6 or early 2.6.18-rc? however; please 
run a xfs_repair v.2.6.10; because the corruption may/will have already 
taken place and a silent time bomb may be waiting.  Three machines 
already died with symptom of the corruption on kernels that no longer 
have the problem.
