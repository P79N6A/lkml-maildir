The .align directive aligns the next code (or data, depending on the
use) to the value following the directive. How it is interpreted
depends on the target architecture and ABI. For more information, check
the "as" info pages. (hint: tkinfo and pinfo are considered better info
browses than GNU info).
The impact on execution time is quite normal: modern CPUs like (and
most RISC CPUs even demand) aligned memory accesses, so I bet .align 16
would at least make the execution time the consistent. Non-aligned
memory accesses on the i386 family make that the CPU has to fix them
up, which costs time.
