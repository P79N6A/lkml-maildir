Actually, this one is my fault, although unless I'm really missing
something gcc 3.4.2 silently accepts the invalid syntax.
All eight of the patches from the pSeries reconfig series are present
in 2.6.12-rc1-mm1.  The error Mikael reported is unrelated to the
state of Linus' tree, and his patch is correct.  (The mistake is
present in both versions of the patches which I posted for review on
linuxppc64-dev; nobody caught it.)
