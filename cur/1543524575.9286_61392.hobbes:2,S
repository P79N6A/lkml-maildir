So put them to include/asm-generic/semaphore.h (and put the .c code say into
a comment), but not to alpha which has them already done properly.
You really want those rw semaphores to be fast and small (because especially
rwsem will most probably be non-contended in down_read), whereas the spinlock
version is neither. It is good to have a generic version to fix some port
quickly, but it is bad to stay at that implementation forever.
