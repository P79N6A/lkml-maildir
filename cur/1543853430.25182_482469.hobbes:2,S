That would suck and not surprise me that much in fact... Take the Apple
bridge... it's unclear at which point they actually decode the MSI and
HT interrupts (the later are just internally converted to MSI-like
stores) to turn them into toggling of MPIC lines, but it probably
happens as an MMIO slave on the main xbar and I'm not 100% certain it
provides ordering vs. the previous stores to memory as they are in the
coherent domain and the MMIO is not. I just hope very much :-) Because
the store queue to memory can re-order on U4.
