Yes, this is the problem and needs to be resolved. Thankfully most
people have keyboard support compiled in so it's not fatal but we
probably waht hotplug package be updated first before we commit this
change.

If I understand correctly we do not have subclasses so it will look like
class
|- input_device
|  |- input0
|  |- input1
|
|- input
|  |-event0
|  |-event1
|  |-mouse0
So breakage is really minimal.
