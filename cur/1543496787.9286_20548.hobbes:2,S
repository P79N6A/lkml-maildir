Hi.
The first compiles as:
	cmp	f,0
	jz	ret
...
ret:	mov	eax,error
	leave
	ret
However the second is something like:
	cmp	f,0
	jnz	nz
	mov	eax,error
	leave
	ret
nz:
	...
It's faster when the code goes straight without jumps. Errors do not
happen often, so the first is better. The compiler doesn't know which
branch is used more, but we know it, so we must suggest the compiler where
to put jumps.
