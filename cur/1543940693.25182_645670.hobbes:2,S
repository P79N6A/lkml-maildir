No difference in behaviour. Open function in misc replaces fops by your 
specified one (like a v4l or tty layer, or chrdev_open aswell, which will be 
called on each character device open).

Misc has one predefined major and is used for such uses, in which you need only 
one minor number. The point is not to block resting 254 minors of one major just 
for only one minor used.
