Perhaps he noticed that on our beloved but marginally m68k we have dummy
ide_request_region() and friends (except on Q40, where IDE is faked to be in
I/O space) and do our resource management in the low-level driver (cfr. the
call to request_mem_region() in gayle.c)?
But then he still breaks PPC...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
