It's something like that.

We have a maximum of 7 32-bit registers to pass system call arguments.
In EABI, 64-bit arguments must be aligned to an even-numbered register
(starting at zero).  In OABI, 64-bit arguments do not have this
restriction.
So, for EABI:
sys_foo(int a, unsigned long long b, int c, unsigned long long d)
would allocate 'a' into r0, 'b' into r2,r3, 'c' into r4, and 'd' into
r6, and oops we're out of registers - so the above syscall prototype
can't be supported on ARM.
However:
sys_foo(int a, int c, unsigned long long b, unsigned long long d)
is entirely reasonable and leaves us with spare room for one additional
32-bit arg to be passed.

Mostly mailing list archives I'd guess.  As far as anyone bothering
to check, that's me when I'm aware of new syscalls... which typically
happens a long time after the syscalls have been introduced on x86
etc.
