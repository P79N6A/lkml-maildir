This doesn't make me happy either. It doesn't work for
network-based filesystems, won't work with KIOBUF and
will mean extra difficulties with filesystems that have
write ordering constraints....
IMHO it would be really nice if this problem was solved
on the /PAGE/ level, so it will work for non-buffer
filesystems as well ;)
(at least, for those problems which aren't specific to
the disk-based filesystems only)

Indeed...
