On the RedHat apollo mailing list, or on linux-net or
linux-newbie.  This is a local configuration issue, not a kernel
devel issue.

Ok, post the specifics of your problem to one of the
aforementioned mailing lists (but not on linux-kernel) and I'll
help you. Be sure to include the details of your card, your
kernel version, various /proc files relating to resource usage,
pci info, and anything else relevant. 
Also, please don't crosspost messages.
