2) will prevent any future gcc from ever assuming it can transform the
strcpy into anything but a call to strcpy, or assume anything about the
semantics of strcpy.  Be careful with 3), as trying to fool the optimizer
is likely to be only a temporary solution (meaning that the kernel people
will return to flame the gcc people when the optimizer gets changed
again).
