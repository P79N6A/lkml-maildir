Sounds like the bash bug that is long-time (and that is just a lot harder 
to trigger on 2.4.x).
The problem is a timing issue in the bash pipeline setup, and if the 
child reads from stdin runs before the parent has fully set up the 
tty process group, the command will get stuck in stopped state.
Fedora core 1 is reported to have a fixed bash, so if you are RH-based, 
the easiest fix should be to just upgrade to that.

SIGCONT will fix it, but yeah, it's not something you want happening.
