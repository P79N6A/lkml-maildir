Does the card show up in lspci at all?  IDSEL drive strength
issues should only affect config space accesses.
Does the extender board have a PCI-PCI bridge on it?  (If not,
there's not really any reason to resistively couple the IDSEL
line to the host, since the host should take care of that.)

That would only make a difference if there is no PCI-PCI bridge on
the extender board.
If the extender resistively couples the host's IDSEL line, you might
see different results on a different host bridge, since different
host bridges can use different numbers of IDSEL stepping cycles.
