They were caused by modpost now being called with several .o files
that are not modules. The fix was just to get rid of the
warning.
I have committed the following to kbuild.git.

    kbuild: do not emit src version warning for non-modules
    modpost is now called with .o files that are not modules.
    So do not warn if there is no corresponding .mod
    file listing .o files (in .tmp_versions/).
