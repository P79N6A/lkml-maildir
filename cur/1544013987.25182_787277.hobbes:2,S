Last time I looked, no cpufreq driver tried to use <linux/clk.h>
calls.  The reason was simple:  the clock framework code sits in
DRAM, so it can't be executed while changing DRAM clocks.
Those bits of cpufreq had to live in on-chip SRAM (there's usually
a few pages of it) and directly update PLL and other clock config
registers ... then wait for things to stabilize before they returned
and the CPU executed from DRAM again.
