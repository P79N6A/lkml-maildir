Yes, that was the right answer.
On a system with sata_mv (machine_1) I indeed had RAID, and that's why I 
suspected I couldn't remove the module. It was confirmed by checking 
/sys/block/sda/sda1/holders:
# ls /sys/block/sda/sda1/holders
md0@
On yet another system (machine_2), with sata_via module, I didn't set up 
RAID, but still, I couldn't remove the module. Inspecting 
/sys/block/sda/sda1/holders revealed why:
# ls /sys/block/sda/sda1/holders
dm-0@  dm-1@  dm-2@
The drive was taken from the machine_1; it had LVM2 on it.
Thanks!
