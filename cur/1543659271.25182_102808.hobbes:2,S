Get cups (I'm using 1.1.18), see backend/usb.c and have a look at the piece 
of code
#ifdef __linux
 /*
  * Show the printer status before we send the file; normally, we'd
  * do this while we write data to the printer, however at least some
  * Linux kernels have buggy USB drivers which don't like to be
  * queried while sending data to the printer...
  */
  if (ioctl(fd, LPGETSTATUS, &status) == 0)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, "DEBUG: LPGETSTATUS returned a port status of 
%02X...\n", status);
    if (status & LP_NOPA)
      fputs("WARNING: Media tray empty!\n", stderr);
    else if (status & LP_ERR)
      fputs("WARNING: Printer fault!\n", stderr);
    else if (status & LP_OFFL)
      fputs("WARNING: Printer off-line.\n", stderr);
  }
#endif /* __linux */
LP_NOPA, LP_ERR and LP_OFFL are from the POSIX-Part.

See the code piece above - its using LPGETSTATUS

I agree.
