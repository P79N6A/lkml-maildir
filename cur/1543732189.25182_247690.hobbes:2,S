True on sparc64 as well where the page table lock is what
synchronizes TLB context allocation for a process.
While the lock is held, we know that the TLB context cannot
change and this allows all kinds of TLB flush optimizations.
We also have the pseudo-invariant that flush_tlb_page() is
always called with the page table lock held.
