You seem to be working that out in another thread :-)
> [PATCH] tcp: splice as many packets as possible at once

> As spotted by Willy Tarreau, current splice() from tcp socket to pipe is not
> optimal. It processes at most one segment per call.
> This results in low performance and very high overhead due to syscall rate
> when splicing from interfaces which do not support LRO.

> With this change, splice() behaves like tcp_recvmsg(), being able

> of payload per frame, that means splice(SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK) can return
> 16*1460 = 23360 bytes.

I've applied this, thanks!
