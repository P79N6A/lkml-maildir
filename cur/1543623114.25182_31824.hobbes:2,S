Hi,
Sorry to beat a dead horse, but wouldn't it be better if sizes didn't
change within the same CPU arch? I don't see how binary-only modules can
ever work reliably if the size of types change depending on people's
.config file. (not that I use any binary-only modules :-).
Is this a common thing done in the kernel? For dma_addr_t, why not just
have it always be 64bit?
