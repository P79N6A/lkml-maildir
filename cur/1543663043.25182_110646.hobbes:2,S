Unix/Linux uses open() close() read() write() and ioctl() (plus a few
others) to interface with modules or any kind of driver. To 'call' some
module function from user-mode, you impliment open() and close(). That
will provide a file-descriptor for subsequent operations. Then you
impliment either read() write() or ioctl() or all, whichever is
most appropriate for the function your module is going to provide.
You never 'call' a kernel function directly from user-mode. One of
the kernel's primary functions is to make this impossible. Kernel
code is protected from direct user-mode access.
