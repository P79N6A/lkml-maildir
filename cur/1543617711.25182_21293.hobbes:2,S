Interesting, as I said before, YMMV. On this system (cheap Korean
mainboard), a previous BIOS rev completely hosed AGP altogether :-/.

Hmm, it's fine here. What chipset and video card are you using? I've
been looking at Athlon boards and I'm curious about issues showing up in
AGP, IDE, PCI among the various platforms -- specifically AMD and Via
(maybe SiS too).
I've heard some (dis?)information that AMD agpgart lacks errata
workarounds? SiS lacks support for more than ATA66? Are there still
problems with Via timers or PCI?
Just curious,
Reid
