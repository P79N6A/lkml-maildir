Hey, if you are willing to add some manual redirection to your gitweb 
setup, you could _probably_ do something like the appended..
(This is totally untested, but you get the idea - teach gitweb to export 
a "git_redirect" file at the top of the repo name, and teach "git fetch" 
to look if that exists and use another repo if so)
