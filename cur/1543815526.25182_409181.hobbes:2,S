Argh, sounds fragile in any case.

I would rather propose that we maintain as much compatibility as possible,
given that we don't even know what those extra fields might be, and would
likely need to have yet another compatibility flag on the feature itself.
Remember that large inodes themselves are incompatible with older kernels
(maybe predating 2.6.9) so we don't need to worry about 2.4 kernels at all.

Which would get their own superblock flags if needed.

The HWM feature would fall under an INCOMPAT flag then, and possibly
also set a flag in the inode to indicate validity (similar to my
proposal for the i_blocks change).

Hmm, is that true?  I thought that 0 was impossible for CRC32, since
even for a zero-length file the initial value should be 0xffffffff,
though I'm not 100% sure of that.

But, doesn't help if i_hwm comes before some other field that is put into
use, so it has to be handled anyways.
