Maybe I need to make a summary here for this issue:
1. The s3 hang is in While-loop in SMPI that looks like
waiting BIOS response.
2. If THM2, THM6, THM7 disabled, disabling THM0._TMP
fix the s3 hang.
I think you need to continue to find out which THMs, which methods
cause s3 hang when THM0._TMP disabled.
I assume the problem is:
THM0._TMP && THMx._XXX && THMy._YYY..
Thanks,
Luming
