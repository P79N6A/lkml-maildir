Hehe.  Funny, you mention this...  A few days ago, while I was doing your other
recommended pageuptodate cleanups, I also added the same call to
SetPageUptodate(lower_page) as you suggested.  I tested that change along w/
the other changes you suggested, and they all seem to work great all the way
from my 2.6.9 backport to 2.6.24-rc2 and -mm (modulo the fact that I had to
work around or fix more non-unionfs bugs in -mm than unionfs ones to get it
to work :-)
I posted all of these patches just now.  You're CC'ed.  Hopefully Andrew can
pull from my unionfs.git branch soon.
You also reported in your previous emails some hangs/oopses while doing make
-j 20 in unionfs on top of a single tmpfs, using -mm.  After several days,
I've not been able to reproduce this w/ my latest set of patches.  If you
can send me your .config and the specs on the h/w you're using (cpus, mem,
etc.), I'll see if I can find something similar to it on my end and run the
same tests.
Cheers,
Erez.
