Yes, that's exactly what RheaVFS and AVFS do. Except that they both use an escape
character because:
1. without it some programs may break [ 
http://lwn.net/Articles/100148/
 ]
2. it's very useful to pass additional parameters after the escape char to the server.
We can start VFS servers (mentioned above) and chroot the whole user session into
the mount directory of the server. It works but it's very slow, practically unusable.
So both servers need some kind of VFS redirector. In the past there were many
different approaches -- LD_PRELOAD hack, CodaFS hack, NFS hack (?), proof-of-concept
kernel hacks (project podfuk) etc.
If anybody can think of any other solution of the "redirector problem", possibly
even non-kernel based one, let me know and I'd be glad :-)
