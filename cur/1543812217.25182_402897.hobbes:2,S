Have you ever considered how many TDs have to be allocated to transfer
a data buffer this big? No, seriously. If your application cannot deliver
the tranfer speeds with 16KB URBs, we ought to consider if the combination
of our USB stack, usbfs, libusb and the application ought to get serious
performance enhancing surgery. The problem is obviously in the software
overhead.
