I get the general idea here, but I just don't think those numbers are
very accurate.  My laptop has a bunch of gunk open (xterm, evolution,
firefox, xchat, etc...).  I ran this command:
lsof | egrep '/(usr/|lib.*\.so)' | awk '{print $9}' | sort | uniq | xargs du -Dcs
and got:
113840  total
On a web/database server that I have (ps aux | wc -l == 128), I just ran
the same:
39168   total
That's assuming that all of the libraries are fully read in and
populated, just by their on-disk sizes. Is that not a reasonable measure
of the kinds of things that we can expect to be shared in a vserver?  If
so, it's a long way from 400MB.
Could you try a similar measurement on some of your machines?  Perhaps
mine are just weird.

Believe me, _I_ don't want Xen. :)

I don't doubt this, but doing this two-level page-out thing for
containers/vservers over their limits is surely something that we should
consider farther down the road, right?
It's important to you, but you're obviously not doing any of the
mainline coding, right?

All workloads that use $limit+1 pages of memory will always pay the
price, right?  :)
