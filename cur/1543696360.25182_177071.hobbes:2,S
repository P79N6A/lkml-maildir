   Cpuburn is a good test to run on x86's.  That said I've only seen it 
fail in 2 systems out of ~20,000.  Generally cpu erros will crash your 
system before the error is printed to the screen.
   Also compiling your kernel in a loop is a good way to shake loose 
cpu, and memory issue.  I've often found this finds errors much quicker 
many memory tests.
   You might want to try ctcs.  "Make ; "./new-burn -t"
