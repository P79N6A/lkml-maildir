Where "etc" is "typecast".  I can't think of much else
which would be found.
So the search for ext2_sb_info found the function, and
then you're down to perfoming a forward search for "p".
Which, of course, doesn't work because "p" is an asinine
identifier.  Which was my point.  (Insert monthly whine
about ext2_new_block)

We do not appear to have an "audit for inclusion" process.
I wish we did.  If a tree owner threw a patch at me and
asked for comments I'd gladly help out that way.  Jeff
did some absolutely brilliant work on the e100/e1000
drivers behind the scenes - it'd be nice to have more of that.
BTW, ext3 keeps a kdev_t on-disk for external journals.  The
external journal support is experimental, added to allow people
to evaluate the usefulness of external journalling.  If we
decide to retain the capability we'll be moving it to a UUID
or mount-based scheme.  So if the kdev_t is being a problem,
I think we can just break it.
