	We have to split between the different issues we have seen.
	Tools issue (the wpa_supplicant problem). -> those can only be
fixed by people upgrading. Fortunately, there are not so many tools
affected, and new version of those tools were released last
April/May. As I said, most distro have those in the pipe.
	In-Kernel driver issues (the Orinoco driver problem). -> those
can be patched and fixed as we go along. I would not worry about
those.
	Out-of-kernel issues (the ipw3945 driver problem). -> those
drivers need to be updated. That's the problem of living outside the
kernel. Very often those drivers are reactive with respect to kernel
API changes, rather than pro-active, so there is not much we can do.

	Actually, it's impossible. New userspace can work across both
version, old userspace fails on new version.
	The whole point of the -rc process is to find problems and the
scope of it, there is no way I can know everything. At this point, we
can decide if WE-21 should go in 2.6.19 or wait for 2.6.20. But I know
that most Linux-Wireless people such as Dan and Jouni have been
waiting impatiently for those changes...
	Have fun...
	Jean
