I don't know enough to have an opinion on this. I'll leave that up to
actual arbiters of taste.

There seemed to be some unwillingness to deal with variable length items
being passed back and forth, to and fro userspace. Placing an fd in the
watch structure would make it fixed size, rather than variable length.
Frankly, I find either as easy to deal with.

To me as well. Robert seems to have issues with making the userspace
interface as simple as possible, hence my suggestion. I'm happy to
withdraw it.

I agree completely.

Apologies, I was unclear. I should not have said that we would pass the
full path back. In fact, we can't, as the same directory may be mounted
in multiple places. I knew this, but I blame lack of sleep for my slip.
