I always assumed it was an optimization when looking for a new PID
after a wrap by trying to skip over the kernel threads.  Arguably 300
is way too small for larger systems (which might have several thousand
kernel threads) and should probably be sized on boot (or when starting
userspace) if anyone really cares.
