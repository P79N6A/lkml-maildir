Is there any other machine that is known to get fubar when using this code?
Perhaps a THINKPAD_SUPPORT in "Processor Types and Features", like there is
already for Toshiba and Dell laptops, that would disable the lm_sensors code,
and besides I think that this code should be marked EXPERIMENTAL, so that
users would be warned about these problems.
Lots of people already use it and it'd be nice to have it in mainline, with
these big fat warnings.
