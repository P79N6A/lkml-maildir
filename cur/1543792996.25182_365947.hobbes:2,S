The above 100HZ test is invalid.  As shown in the times, it was run
after 54000 some seconds, which means that the file system was probably
already cached.  So I did fresh reboots and ran the test shortly after
bootup. 
The test results are again at 
http://www.kihontech.com/tests/hz_times/
but they are all with a *_2.* in the name.
Here are the times that were run for each test (100HZ vs 1000HZ and
preempt vs nopreempt).
1000HZ preempt:
Thu Nov 10 18:05:11 EST 2005
Thu Nov 10 18:13:01 EST 2005
real    7m49.741s
user    0m46.464s
sys     4m41.524s
1000HZ nopreempt:
Thu Nov 10 22:17:33 EST 2005
Thu Nov 10 22:25:15 EST 2005
real    7m42.339s
user    0m47.156s
sys     4m33.205s
100HZ preempt:
# time ./testme
Thu Nov 10 17:40:29 EST 2005
Thu Nov 10 17:48:12 EST 2005
real    7m42.418s
user    0m46.190s
sys     4m40.350s
100HZ nopreempt:
Thu Nov 10 17:52:15 EST 2005
Thu Nov 10 17:59:56 EST 2005
real    7m40.976s
user    0m44.840s
sys     4m34.510s
This seems to show that 100HZ with no preemption was the fastest, but
the times are too close, so it is of a difference of ~0.2% which is well
in the margin of error.  So this test really doesn't show much benefit
between the settings.
Tomorrow, I'll see if I can make a test that serves up web pages, and
see if that will show the benefits for servers and the settings for HZ
and preemption.
