	Hi,
	I've noticed a serious problem with linux 2.2.9. Configuration:
- Dell Dual PII 400 - 256 Mo
- Megaraid Raid 5 board
- Apache 1.3.6 with 200 Max clients + PHP3
- NR_TASKS raised to 2048
- Some proc values raised:
/proc/sys/fs/file-max:32768
/proc/sys/fs/inode-max:65536
/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax:268435456
	I tried the ab programm (benchmark tool shipped with Apache). I've
runned it with 2000 requests. After the run, the system is in very bad
state: more than 100 Apache zombie process that does not go away and if I
try a ps -aux, sometimes I got:
zsh: fork failed: resource temporarily unavailable
	I also tried 2.2.9_andrea3 patch with same result. Ideas ?
	Thanks.
