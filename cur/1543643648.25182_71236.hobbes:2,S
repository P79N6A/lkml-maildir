I am extremely sorry I made a typing error. When I
executed the command make xconfig I got the following
output
rm -f include/asm
(cd include; ln -sf asm -i386 asm)
make -C scripts kconfig.tk
make: *** scripts: No such file or directory. Stop.
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
Please help me to fix the error.
Thanking You.
Regards,
Srinivas Chavva
