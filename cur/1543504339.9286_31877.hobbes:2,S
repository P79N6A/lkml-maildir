Wrong.  Linux/MIPS is running on both little and big endian platforms
and it's equally reliable.  In a few cases endianess fixes have been
necessary but in the large picture of things endianess is a neglegtible
issue.  Having said that, some of the embedded people have choosen
a specific endianess for their platforms because it saves them a
significant amount of CPU.  Nothing that couldn't be solved in hardware ...
