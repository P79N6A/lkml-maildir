You've got the pirq setup from hell.
Mind doing that "dump_pirq" thing, preferably run on an _unmodified_ 2.4.0
kernel (ie none of my test-hacks) or on a 2.2.x kernel (that doesn't even
_try_ to do any routing at all - or you can get the same effect by just
making "set_sis_pirq()" always just return 0 without doing anything)?
I don't want to get quantum effects of the observer changing what is being
observed..

Not any better. The thing just moves around, it seems.
I'll think about this, and try to find the SiS irq routing register spec
somewhere..
