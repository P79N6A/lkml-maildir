Subject: hda active and hdb sleep?
Hello
As soon as I issue hdparm -Y /dev/hdb I get errors on hda and it doesn't
seem to be possible to have hdb in sleep and hfa active. I think, those
power-states are purely per-device, aren't they. It's a VIA ProSavage
KM133 chipset. 2.6.3 kernel at the moment.
Thanks
Guennadi
