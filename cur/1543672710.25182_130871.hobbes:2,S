I have several times told you that the proper way to do it is the same as 
for fd_set, and in fact you can use "fdset" as the CPU set _today_, even 
if it looks a bit strange.
In other words, the proper way to do set_cpu() is
	int set_cpu(int cpu)
	{
		fd_set cpuset;
		FD_ZERO(&cpuset);
		FD_SET(cpu, cpuset);
		return sched_setaffinity(getpid(), sizeof(cpuset), &cpuset);
	}
which is a HELL OF A LOT more readable than the crap you're spouting 
(either your "before" _or_ your "after" crap).
And if you want to make it more readable still, you make a "cpuset.h" 
header file that creates a "cpu_set" type instead of "fd_set". You can 
do it by search-and-replace of the fd_set stuff if you want to.
But yeah, if you by "portable" mean that it won't handle more than 1024 
CPUs, then I guess it isn't portable. But guess what? I don't care. If you 
seriously expect to have more than 1024 CPUs in the near future, make the 
cpu_set be bigger.
But I expect you to ignore this email too, the way you ignored my previous
ones. The same way I'll continue to ignore your idiotic patches.
