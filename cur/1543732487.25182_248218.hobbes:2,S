Data point:
I use an ACOM portable drive that (I'm fairly sure) uses the same
USB/Firewire interface chip-set.
It sometimes has trouble being discovered on my COMPAQ Presario
Lap-top using USB, and sometimes has the same trouble on Firewire
using Linux-2.4.26 drivers. But once it is mounted on either systems
I don't have any trouble.
