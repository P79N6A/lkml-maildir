   On sparc64. But is that true too for all other 64bit architectures supported?
   e.g. How about PA-RISC? (always seems to do things differently)
It cannot require more than the existing API requires, which is
"unsigned long *bitmask", ie. anything equivalent in behavior to an
unsigned long pointer is good enough.
