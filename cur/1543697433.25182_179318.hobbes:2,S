	I may be real dense, but your Howto only describe using nameif
at boot time, which is mostly useless for Pcmcia cards (unless you
want to solder Pcmcia cards in their slots).

	That's the point. If you want it to work with Pcmcia cards
(and other dynamic devices such as USB), 'nameif" *must* be called
from the hotplug scripts (pretty obvious, isn't it ?). And currently
you can't do that properly, which is the reason of my changes.
	Note that once you add nameif in the hotplug scripts, you no
longer need to call it at boot time, so with one bird you kill two
stones.

	Thanks for looking into that.
