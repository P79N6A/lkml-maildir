The problem with the OSL is that it requires mirror sites to get
anybody downloading OSL-licensed software from them to explicitly
agree to the license; this is simply not practical, and the result is
that it is not feasible to freely mirror OSL-licensed software. This
hasn't been fixed with OSL 2, and as such it would be an exceptionally
poor choice for any piece of software that you want to be widely
distributed, which certainly includes Linux.
