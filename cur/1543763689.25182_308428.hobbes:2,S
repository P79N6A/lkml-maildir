Hi,
I've been working on a new DES implementation for Linux, and ran into
the problem of how to get access to C99 types like uint_fast32_t for
internal (not interface) use.  In my tests, key setup on Athlon 64 slows
down by 40% when using u32 instead of uint_fast32_t.
So I wonder if there is any standard way of, say, including stdint.h for
internal use in kernel code?
