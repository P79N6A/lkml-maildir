bdflush and 2.4's equivalent are tunable; if all you do is this copying
then optimise these parameters for this task.

what you are asking for is a feed-forward system: a way for the application
to tell kernel "I'm only reading this once, so after I'm done, throw it out
straight away"
and "I'm only writing this data, so after I'm done, start writing it out and
then forget it"
perhaps you could try mounting the destinatinon 'sync'
with dd at least you could specify block size,
there is also raw devices (no cache) mmaped files with madvise,
fdatasync()... lots of ways.

Isn't this due to the journaling filesystem?  All that seeking sure slows
things down...
