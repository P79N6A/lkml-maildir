You don't have to wait for every program to use the new names, if devfs
is
the way you want to go.  Do a "rgrep /dev /etc/*" and you'll find
that many device-using programs have their device names stored in
configuration files.  Fixing these files is simple, just replace 
/dev/device with whatever the symlink points to.  [This leaves a few
files like /etc/securetty that use relative pathnames.  These are
of course fixable too, they just don't have the /dev to search for.]
This lets you get rid of a lot of symlinks.  I still need symlinks for
/dev/tty* (hardcoded in X), isdn stuff and sound stuff.  Everything else
is gone from dev, sitting comfortably in subdirectories only.
Getting rid of all "possible" disks helped in particular, "ls /dev"
fits in a standard 80x25 screen now. :-)
