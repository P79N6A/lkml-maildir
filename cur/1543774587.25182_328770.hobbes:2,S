Maybe but I once checked some other error scenario. I generated (by 
mistake of course) dm table that lineary connected 3 times the same 
partition (instead of 3 different partitions). Both Reiser4 and Reiserfs3 
gave a lot of errors while trying to use such device. Ext3 did not give 
single error and was hapily droping my data,
I agree that this is not very useful test case for disk problems but it 
shows that, at least, checks for trouble in Reiser4 are miles before those 
in Ext2/3. If only Reiser4 could print a note what I done wrong... ;-)
