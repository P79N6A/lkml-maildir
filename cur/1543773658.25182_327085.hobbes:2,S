I had a git archive from just after 2.6.12-rc6, which I've not touched on
my local system..
Now I've just done
cd linux-2.6
git-pull-script rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
And I get:
sent 69638 bytes  received 17423079 bytes  52928.04 bytes/sec
total size is 135185594  speedup is 7.73
Updating from 27198d855abbfc82df69e81b6c8d2f333580114c to
1d345dac1f30af1cd9f3a1faa12f9f18f17f236e.
Destroying all noncommitted data!
Kill me within 3 seconds..
fatal: Entry 'Documentation/DocBook/scsidrivers.tmpl' would be overwritten
by merge. Cannot merge.
but I haven't touched that tree so I shouldn't get merge issues..
whatsup?
Dave.
