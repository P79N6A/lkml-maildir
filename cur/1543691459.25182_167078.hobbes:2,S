If your filesystems were mounted readonly and the boot won't mount them
writable, you should be fine with no special precautions. Last time I
looked at 2.6 code, it didn't fix the suspend header when you use
noresume. If that's still true, you should be able to boot with the
noresume option, and then later normally.
(The 2.4 functionality I spoke of works differently, partly because it
does fix the suspend header if you use the noresume option.)

Nigel
