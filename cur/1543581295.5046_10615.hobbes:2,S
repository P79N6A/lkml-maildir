On a nvidia riva 128 and a stock rh7 with kernel-2.4.1ac4 and above 
which has rivafb-0.9.2 when I startx the desktop is dark. This is in 
16bit and 24bit modes.
I have been told the Riva hardware can be programmed to expect 8 bit or 
6 bit color registers. Rivafb < 0.7.2 used 6 bit color registers, but 
the hw was programmed to 8 bit registers on TNT/TNT2. That was causing 
the so called 'dark console' bug. Rivafb 0.9.2 begins to utilize 8 bits 
on Riva 128, but the XFree86-4.0.1 server uses only 6 bits of them so 
your desktop's brightness is 1/4.
