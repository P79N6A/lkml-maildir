OK, I'll check it.  But I will still need to stick with the stop-at-
every-instruction approach, since this counting is just the start of
my project. I am developing a intepretation-like scheme, and need do
do some action at every instruction. The counting was just the stopping
mechanism.   I do not use ptrace, since I want to do it in kernel space.
Thanks, it was giving me nightmares :(
