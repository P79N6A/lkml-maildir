Alan - have there been any changes to the flush/spindown code between
2.5.42 and 2.5.44?  I remember a discussion about a month ago where
you said that it's necessary to do both, but that the order could be
wrong.  I am seriously begining to suspect that something is
definitely wrong, because I can actually hear the disk spindown for a
fraction of a second, then spin up again, (at least with 2.5.43, so
far not with 2.5.44).
John.
