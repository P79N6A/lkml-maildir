No, my patch doesn't force all early allocations to be page padded.
for find_e820_mem, i just change PAGE_ALIGN to be aligned align parameter....
only make early_node_mem have aligned data. because it seems it like to...and assume that.
I think your patch will get early panic about overlap between bss and bootmem...
like the 256g machine, bss is overlapped with early page table...
so could change 
-       node_data[nodeid] = early_node_mem(nodeid, start, end, pgdat_size);
+       node_data[nodeid] = early_node_mem(nodeid, start, end, pgdat_size,
+                                          ZONE_ALIGN);
===>
-       node_data[nodeid] = early_node_mem(nodeid, start, end, pgdat_size);
+       node_data[nodeid] = early_node_mem(nodeid, start, end, pgdat_size,
+                                          PAGE_SIZE);
or
-       if (mem != -1L)
+       if (mem != -1L) {
+               mem = round_up(mem, PAGE_SIZE);
                return __va(mem);
+       }
