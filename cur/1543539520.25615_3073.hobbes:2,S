	If you assume the abuser has root there is *nothing* you can do.

	It doesn't make *any* real difference how big the programs are.  If
the abuser has root access it won't make *any* difference.

	This is false.  You have already defined that the user has root
above.  If the user does *not* have root access and can still cause such
damage then the exploit should be fixed.

	You are intentionally obfuscating the issue by making claims and
assumptions and then trying to claim you didn't.

	If the security isn't perfect how about we *fix* them instead of
trying to fix the impossible.  If the abuser has root it isn't going to
make any difference.  Hell, the abuser could *reboot* the machine into
some stupid OS and set it up such that it blows away the disk.  So much
for all of the crap we stuck in the linux kernel to not allow this.  Now
we have a bunch of crap in the kernel that doesn't actually protect
anything.  I thought the general idea was that excess crap in the kernel
was *bad*.
