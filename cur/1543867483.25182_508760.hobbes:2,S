Ok.  If that is all this may be a difference that makes no difference.
binutils has a bad habit of looking at sections (which are fully
optional) instead of segments on ET_EXEC and ET_DYN objects.  Only
ET_REL objects (.o files) are required to have sections.
It is worth checking but as long as something looking strictly at the
program headers can find the notes and read them we are in good shape.
That readelf -n has a problem there concerns me a little but as
usually that program is better than the rest of binutils.
So I recommend for testing write a 100 line program that includes
elf.h and reads out the note segment.  If all is well we can split
this code out.
