Don't bother.  As I keep saying and have been saying since the all*config
targets were introduced, they're useless for ARM, because ARM is soo
diverse.
You need to find a platform configuration which uses the file.
Eg,
$ grep rtctime arch/arm/common/Makefile
obj-y                           += rtctime.o
In this case, any one will do.
But lets say you modify arch/arm/common/uengine.c:
$ grep uengine arch/arm/common/Makefile
obj-$(CONFIG_ARCH_IXP2000)      += uengine.o
obj-$(CONFIG_ARCH_IXP23XX)      += uengine.o
$ grep CONFIG_ARCH_IXP2000= arch/arm/configs/*
arch/arm/configs/ixp2000_defconfig:CONFIG_ARCH_IXP2000=y
$ grep CONFIG_ARCH_IXP23XX= arch/arm/configs/*
arch/arm/configs/ixp23xx_defconfig:CONFIG_ARCH_IXP23XX=y
So now you know you need to use ixp2000_defconfig or ixp23xx_defconfig as
a basis for building uengine.c.  (which is reasonable because it's an
IXP2000 or IXP2300 specific support file.)
