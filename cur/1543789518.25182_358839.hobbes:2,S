I agree and would like to see the "bus" functionality just as set of special
methods of a unified device struture also used for class devices.

But will sticking stuff like "mice" or "tty" into "platform" will really
work? These devices belong to their own primary class like "input" or "tty" and
they can not be part of a "bus" at the same time, right?
I'm dreaming of:
  - merging "struct device" and "struct class_device"
  - provide current "bus" and "class" methodes for _all_ devices
  - every current "bus", just becomes a "class" to indicate a group
    of devices, where "input" has the same "group interface" in
    /sys/class/ as "pci" - buses go away completely
  - every device is a member of one single class, be it a pci-bus-device
    or a virtual class
  - separate strictly between hierarchy and classification, which
    is a bit ugly sometimes cause of the flat class layout, but it
    provides a very nice way to keep the class interface simple and
    therefore stable, while still be able to change the device hierarchy
  - /sys/devices becomes a buch of trees and some parent-less devices
    in the root, its whole reason is just to export the device dependency
    structure, nothing else
That way the "platform bus" would be a "platform class", which will only
contain devices which are not part of any other class. All these
parent-less devices would live in the root of /sys/devices to reflect
their lack of dependency.
Things like "tty" and "mice", would be members of their natural
class, but also live in the root of /sys/devices. That way we have the
technically correct classifcation and hierarchy.
Does that make sense?
Thanks,
Kay
