Looks good - thanks, Andi.
I notice that you didn't bother with the fractional byte that is handled
by 'endmask' in mm/mempolicy.c:get_nodes().  But I really don't give a
hoot - either way is fine by me.
I've written a couple of code snippets that manage to intuit the size of
the kernel's cpumask dynamically from user space, by probing with
various sched_getaffinity() calls.  But since your patch only changes
the errors generated by sched_setaffinity() [that's "set", not "get"], I
will not experience any grief from this subtle change in the kernel's
API.
Should you lock hotplug before calling get_user_cpu_mask(), since
get_user_cpu_mask() depends on cpu_online_mask()?
