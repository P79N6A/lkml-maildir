Fairly speaking, I wasn't happy about that either - that's why
I tried to change only a single bit in the first patch.
Note that this stuff was intended for 2.4 in the first place :-)

Agreed.
I would even go further and add a "quirks" field to the struct
pci_dev (probably 16 bits would be enough). Thus we can define
specific bits for common PCI bugs - not only QUIRK_TRANSPARENT_BRIDGE
but also things like QUIRK_BROKEN_MWI or even
QUIRK_SOME_COMMON_PCI_IDE_BUG and so on. This would allow generic code
to check a single bit instead of looking through several
vendor/device ID lists.
Thoughts?
Ivan.
