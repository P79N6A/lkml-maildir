There is also a longer PhD thesis by her.  10 minutes is about as much 
work as I personally am willing to lose and try to remember.  Avoiding 
75% of writes instead of 20% is a substantial performance gain worth 
paying a cost for.  Unfortunately it is not easy to say if it is worth 
that much cost, but I suspect it is.  An approach we are exploring is 
for blocks to reach disk earlier than that if the device is not 
congested, on the grounds that if not much IO is occuring, then 
performance is not important.
