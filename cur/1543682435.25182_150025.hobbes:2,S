Subject: 2.6-test1 startup messages?

  I just converted a box to 2.6-test1.  I've installed the module-init-tools
per another thread on the list.  Spread throughout the startup messages
of the system (Debian Unstable) are messages that read:
FATAL: Module /dev/tts not found
FATAL: Module /dev/tts not found
FATAL: Module /dev/ttsS?? not found
FATAL: Module /dev/ttsS?? not found
looking at /dev/tty* I have /dev/tty, /dev/tty0-tty63.  There is no
/dev/ttyS0 (serial console) or tts*.
Have they been renamed or did I miss something in my config?  Can anyone
point me to a thread?  Digging through the archives gave some great
reading material yet nothing that seemed to answer my problem.
Thanks for any pointers,
  I'd still gladly recomend Linux to my friends.
    Robert
