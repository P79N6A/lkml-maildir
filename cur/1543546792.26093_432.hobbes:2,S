Yes? So how about
	fd2 = dup(fd1);
					read(fd1,...);
	close(fd1);
Is the file closed in that case? If no - you've got completely weird
semantics (having dup() changes rules for operations on original fd), if
yes - what happens with your arguments about leaks?

Wonderful. Now tell me what to do with SCM_RIGHTS cookies, OK? And while
you are at it, what to do with mmap()? Besides, what processes hold
->f_count on /dev/zero and how many lists poor task_struct should be on?
