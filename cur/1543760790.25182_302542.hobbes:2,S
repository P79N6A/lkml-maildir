Fortunately, most interrupts on IA64, ARM, etc.,  are unshared.  And
with PCI-Express, the problem will go away.  Even on X86, things
aren't all bad: one can usually find a PCI slot which doesn't share
interrupts with anything you care about.
The scenario I'm thinking about with these patches are things like
low-latency user-level networking between nodes in a cluster, where
for good performance even with a kernel driver you don't want to share
your interrupt line with anything else.
