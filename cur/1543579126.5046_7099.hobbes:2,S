I have a server program that communicates with a number of client
programs via TCP sockets. I have tried to measure the response time
of the server program by using a program similar to tcpdump (that
uses a packet socket).
However, when I run the server program on 2.4.0 within a
SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR scheduling class (instead of SCHED_OTHER)
the average response time gets better (and is more predictable)
but I occasionally get delays that seems to be multiples of 2
seconds, in the range of 2 to 26 seconds. I don't get this
behavior with 2.2.18.
Does anybody have some idea why I get this strange behavior on 2.4.0?
