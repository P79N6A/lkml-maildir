It depends on the nature of the error, and which parts were decompressed
successfully.  Gzip has optional "re-sync" capability, and ideally a
decompression failure might invoke some kind of bad-block tagging
for the output instead of halting the machine.  Some init{rd,ramfs}
have all the network drivers, all the SCSI drivers, all the sound
drivers, etc., but the user may care only about those for the current
machine.  Other init{rd,ramfs} contain only "essential" pieces.
Even then, the pieces that are deemed more important can be at the
beginning.  It might be possible to work without a sound driver,
but perhaps not without a SCSI driver.

It may be possible to recover, at least partially, from one error
more than from another.  It would be nice if the decompressor itself
was a minor influence instead of a major one.
