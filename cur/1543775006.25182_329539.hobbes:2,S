Hi,
how about adding to the kernel list at 
http://kernel.org
a link to the git log.
Currently we have:
F V VI C Changelog
How about adding a link to the respestive git logs ?
F V VI C Changelog GIT
GIT might be a link to:
        
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=shortlog
or
        
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=log
Personally I like better view through the changes looking at the git shortlog,
which is much more readable than files like patch-2.6.12-git10.log
Well git log is also more readable than the patch-git.log thing.
Whaddya think?
Regards,
Maciej
