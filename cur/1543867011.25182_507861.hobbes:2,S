This statement is false. Sorry but the law and my legal advice recommend
that I jump in and repeat the correction every time people repeat this
myth. As one of the major kernel copyright holders I have never given
people at large specific rights outside of the GPL to distribute non free
derivative works of the kernel in violation of the GPL. Anyone who does
binary modules, does so at their peril and on the advice of their lawyers
as to whether what they are doing is permissible in local law.
