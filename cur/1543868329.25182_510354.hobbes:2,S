In general, writepage is supposed to do work without blocking on
expensive locks that will get pdflush and dirty reclaim stuck in this
fashion.  You'll probably have to take the same approach reiserfs does
in data=journal mode, which is leaving the page dirty if fuse_get_req_wp
is going to block without making progress.
Queue it somewhere else (ie an internal Fs cleaning thread) and leave
the page dirty so that we can move on to other pages that have a chance
of being cleaned.
