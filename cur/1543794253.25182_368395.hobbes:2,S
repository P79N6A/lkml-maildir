That's the limit to what I can do (I don't have the hardware) and let's just
wait for the maintainer to respond.
For now, you can eliminate that message by turning acceleration off.
video=intelfb:accel:0
Another solution is to disable direct rendering, but I don't think you want
that.

PS: I saw this problem before with i810fb, and this is because the i810 driver
of X and i810fb shared the same ringbuffer.  But the i810 chipset has 2 ringbuffers,
so I just made i810fb use the ringbuffer that is not touched by X/DRI. (I don't
know the status now since I don't have this chipset anymore).  That is one 
solution.
