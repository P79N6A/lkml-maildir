I have the same problem. Kernel is 2.6.6.
May 29 16:35:56 sol kernel: hdc: ATAPI 24X DVD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB 
Cache, UDMA(33)
Error:
May 29 16:13:32 sol kernel: cdrom: dropping to single frame dma
And after that I got some:
May 29 16:35:04 sol kernel: hdc: command error: error=0x54
May 29 16:35:04 sol kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 0
May 29 16:35:04 sol kernel: Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 0
May 29 16:35:04 sol kernel: hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady 
SeekComplete Error }
Temporary solution was:
rmmod ide-cd
modprobe ide-cd
