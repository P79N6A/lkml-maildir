I think that I've partially addressed that objection by narrowing the 
focus of the alternative schedulers so that the dilution of effort is 
reduced.  The dichotomy between the dual array schedulers (ingosched and 
nicksched) and the single array schedulers (staircase and the SPA 
schedulers) is the main stumbling block to narrowing the focus further.

kernbench results show that the penalties for an all purpose scheduler 
aren't very big so it's probably not a bad philosophy.  In spite of this 
I think specialization is worth pursuing if it can be achieved with very 
small configurable differences to the mechanism.  If the configuration 
change can be done at boot time or on a running system then it's even 
better e.g. your "compute" switch in staircase.

Even if plugsched has no hope of getting into the mainline kernel, I see 
it as a useful tool for the practical evaluation of the various 
approaches.  If it could go into -mm for a while this evaluation could 
be more widespread.
In it's current state it should not interfere with other scheduling 
related development such as the load balancing changes, cpusets etc.

I wasn't aware of that.

Nor do I.
