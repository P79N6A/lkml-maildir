I only did a quick check with menuconfig. Are you sure it's really
removed? It should still be there as "/root.old".
I probably should change the behaviour of the save routine to behave
differently for directories as argument, but it doesn't remove it.
(Changing gconfig to only accept files in the save request would probably
be nice too...)
bye, Roman
