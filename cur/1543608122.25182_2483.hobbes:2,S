Greetings,
Last weekend I downloaded a tarball of kernel 2.4.13 and proceeded to
build it for my system.  The compile went cleanly as expected and when I
did a depmod -a I didn't get any unresolved symbols.  After rebooting
the computer I ran into a strange problem.  Just after the message
"Backspace key sends ^?" the machine apparently locked up.  There was no
activity from the harddrive although I could toggle the caps lock,
scroll lock and numlock keys on the keyboard.  The usual three finger
salute illicited no response(I have it disabled in /etc/inittab which
may be the reason.)  Out of frustration I cycled the power and booted
back into my previous kernel, 2.4.9.  I compiled 2.4.13 again and
removed a few experimental options I had enabled, IPv6 and such.  Again
I rebooted and the results were the same.  After doing some searching on
Google I ran across a problem with the pts file system and the dev file
system.  Again I recompiled disabling the pts file system.  Again the
system hung at "Backspace key sends ^?."  After booting back to the
2.4.9 kernel, I compiled a 2.4.13 _without_ devfs support.  Upon doing
so the machine proceeded to boot normally.  This has me very puzzled.
My question is am I doing something wrong?  Was there some documentation
I neglected to read that would explain this to me?  It isn't absolutely
mission critical that I am running the 2.4.13 kernel I just like to
remain current.  Judging by the traffic here on the list I'm guessing we
are edging closer to 2.4.14 which I will most likely try if I can't
figure out a solution for my current problem.  If anyone has any
suggestions or perhaps can point me in the right direction I would
greatly appreciate it.  Thank you in advance to anyone who may take time
to assist me.
