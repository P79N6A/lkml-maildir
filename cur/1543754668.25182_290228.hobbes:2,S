Hi,
I had some problems with my laptop's onetouch keys and it eventually led me to 
keyboard.c file from 2.6.10 kernel (Vojtech Pavlik and others).  There may be 
a bug in the file, please read below.
Well, actually, when all omnibook/messages/setkeycodes/hotkeys/xev/showkey etc 
stuff is stripped off, what remains is that x86_keycodes array has only first 
240 members initialized, while remaining 16 are set to 0 due to [256]:
static unsigned short x86_keycodes[256] = { <only 240 here> };
(For my scenario, workaround was possible.)
I am not sure if this is a bug or not; it worked in 2.4.18 without workaround. 
Might be that someone wanted to prevent reading invalid memory.  There are 
many versions of the file/array definition found on the web, none of which has 
a comment about this.
Please also use my email address <mg94c18@alas.matf.bg.ac.yu> if you respond 
to this.  I am a member but not sure for how long (depends on number of 
messages/day).
Thanks,
Sasa
