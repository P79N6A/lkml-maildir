Subject: rtc-ds1742.c should use resource_size_t for base address

Currently the rtc driver, rtc-ds1742.c uses an unsigned long to store
the base mmio address of the NVRAM/RTC.  This breaks on systems like
PowerPC 440, which is a 32-bit core with 36-bit physical addresses: IO
on the system, including the RTC, is typically above the 4GB point,
and cannot fit into an unsigned long.
This patch fixes the problem by replacing the unsigned long with a
resource_size_t.  Tested on Ebony (PPC440) (with additional patches to
instantiate the ds1742 platform device appropriately).
