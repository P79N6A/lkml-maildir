Which is why you need to export the kernel device view in some format to the
user space. Either as a file system or a binary table of some form. The
only place the kernel side information lives is in the drivers, so they need
to provide information back to whatever exports data to user space.
Thats absolutely identical to the devfs hooks. devfs is generating an fs
from them, doing a usermode smart /dev is exporting the same data devfs
builds on into user space and doing the hard thinking in user space.
