I was not personally offended, but I hope what you said here is taken by 
others as a good-faith gesture.

This is just part of the community, something which you should learn to 
take advantage of.  It's part of an impressive system of checks and 
balances.
A major principle of internet communication is that people will say 
venomous things in email which they would never say to you in person. 
You have to take what they say for what it MEANS, not what it looks like.
If you're flamed, particularly in a forum like LKML, pay attention to 
the meat of what the person is saying.  If the person is right, GREAT. 
If the person has completely misunderstood the situation, let it go.
And then, don't get drawn into endless debate defending yourself to 
every comment that people make.  Sometimes, it's best to just summarize 
the situation, acknowledge people's complaints, explain which ones are 
factual, and explain that you're working on a solution.
There are a number of people on LKML who seem to do an amazing job of 
getting to the point in a debate.  Take Theodore Ts'o, for example.  In 
particular, his posts are a pleasure to read because they are so clear 
and full of knowledge.
