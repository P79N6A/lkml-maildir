That should have been fixed in 2.6.x. If you do mount /proc/fs/nfsd, and
use a recent enough version of mountd, then knfsd can and will work
without any extra help from exportfs.
The one problem I have found with this implementation is that it relies
very heavily on reverse-DNS lookups, so it may give unexpected results
if you have more than one name for your client. I can't see why that
shouldn't be fixable, though...
