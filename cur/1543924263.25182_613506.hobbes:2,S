A long long time ago, in a land so far away that people walked
upside down, there lived a wizard called Paul. Paul was a very
powerful wizard and created the ppp daemon from the darkness.
The pppd daemon was good and hard working, but not very clever.
It thought that everything it conneected to was a terminal.
Paul saw that this was a bad thing, and when it was old enough he
sent the daemon to school and taught it about the generic ppp layer
and about the "notty" option.
Someone who actually has IRDA and still uses it (do they exist ?) needs to
do the relevant work to the irda FIR code.
