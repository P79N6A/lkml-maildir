For the Linux kernel I disagree.  New driver submissions frequently call
old interfaces and needlessly duplicate code because the driver author
was unaware of a function or two.
Sure, the source code is out there for them to read, but I seriously
doubt most people go to the trouble of reading the implementation of
each interface they use.  For example, how many people know create
create_proc_entry() will create directories for you, if you pass it a
pathname like "tty/foo"?
Stable interfaces like that IMHO benefit from docs, to enable driver
authors to use modern, up-to-date interfaces.
