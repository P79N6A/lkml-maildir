Henning, perhaps you can explain to me how the following isn't a 
	"I don't do XYZ"
	"XYZ"
statement?

That would be the "I don't do XYZ..."

And this would be the "XYZ".
If you are going to yell at people for a particular behaviour, it's really
more effective if you don't show that behaviour in the midst of your yelling,
wouldn't you agree?  Just a friendly thought.

It would appear that you find everything I say patronizing, regardless of
what it is or how it is said.  I'm sorry about that, but I'm not going
to change how I speak to suit you.  Yell all you want.  I'd suggest
that if you find my emails offensive, you add me to your kill file.

Your approach to this whole topic is a good example of why I run my own
company and I have absolute authority to fire people at will.  If you 
worked here and you persisted with this approach, you would be fired,
without question.  I don't know how to say it more clearly, I don't
say it lightly, hiring someone, training them, all of that is a huge
investment.  One which I would discard if you couldn't fit in.  Coding
style is part of fitting in, it isn't optional in any code I pay for.
You may have a different view, that's cool, you're entitled.  But realize
that any professional software organization is unlikely to agree with you.
For whatever that is worth.
