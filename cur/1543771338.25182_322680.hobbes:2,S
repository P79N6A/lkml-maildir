Oh, I wasn't arguing with your approach ... is always better to go a bit
further. Was just illustrating that there are real world problems right
now that hit this stuff, ergo we need it. Yes, I'd like to be able to do 
large page, memory hotplug, etc too ... but if people aren't excited about
those, there are plenty of other reasons to fix the frag problem.
It seems apparent statistically that the larger the machine, the worse the
frag problem is, as we'll blow away more memory before getting contig 
blocks. If it wasn't pre-7am, I'd try to calculate the statistics, but 
frankly, I can't be bothered ;-) I'm sure there are others whose math
degree is less rusty than mine.

Yes, would be nice ... but we need to gather things into freeable and 
non-freeable either way, it seems, so doesn't invalidate what you're 
doing at all.
