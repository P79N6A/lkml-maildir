In my program, the standard input is filtered through a lex scanner
whose output file is the pty. So it does indeed need to be a stream.
Since I'm using flex, I won't have much control over the writing
process. When will it be necessary to read from the pty, to prevent a
deadlock? After each character the user types?
I might use SIGIO to read from the pty, but I have the 2.4 kernel that
doesn't support SIGIO on pipes and FIFOs. I assume ptys have the same
problem.
