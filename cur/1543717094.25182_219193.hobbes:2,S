Hm, let me think about it. diff does not need to check all permutations,
it checks only those two which it needs to compare.
IMHO "inodes done right" is something like this: if inode numbers are
different, then files are not hardlinked/cowlinked. If they are the same,
check is_hardlinked(a,b) or is_cowlinked(a,b) to find out.
This beats O(n^2) argument.
But this is non-POSIX, would not be accepted.
I don't know how to handle this now. Introducing cow-inode number
with semantic "cowino1==cowino2 => files are cowlinked" is
ugly and won't deal with per-block cow. Sooner or later someone
will want to have per block cow. Think about cow'ing multi-gigabyte
database files for checkpointing/backup purposes...

Is this the same to my "cow-inode number" concept above?
