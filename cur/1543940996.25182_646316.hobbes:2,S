given that this has been in fedora/rhel for 5 years with no complaints...
it's extremely rare, and if you are someone who's going to use it to do some weird
form of kernel debugging, you already know that way ahead of time, when you
compile your kernel.
(Note: I don't know of any tools that do kernel debugging this way. At all)
