I know... Said that I wouldn't come back unless there was a problem. But 
with these results! The patch is fantastic.
My problem app, blender, allocated all remaining physical memory and 360 
megs (of the 1 gig) swap but remained running. No oom-kill involved at 
all. This is a first with that app (in such a mode, with such a large 
working set of pictures). 500 1.2 meg uncompressed targa pictures 
animated in the graphical window of "Sequence Editor" on my system (256 
meg real mem). Wow.
The oom-kill/swap/memory handling/whatever must have been really sick.
Thank You!
