Subject: Sis900 ethernet dropping 70% packets

I'm trying to install a little Via C3 machine with on-board Sis900 ethernet. 
As usual, I booted my LNX-BBC rescue disk, configured eth0 and tried to scp 
my distro over, but failed miserably.
Pinging other hosts on the net sees 70-80% packets getting lost.
LNX-BBC rescue cd uses a 2.4.19 kernel
So then I tried a Trinity rescue disk, using a 2.4.21 kernel. Same thing.
Anybody got experience of this? Googling gives wads of people with similar 
sounding problems, mostly interrupt related, sometimes Vlan related (It's 
plugged into a Cisco catalyst but I tried a x-over cable to my laptop with 
the same result, so I don't think thats relevant), but don't see any 
solutions.
Is this a known-bad interface? The drivers sources don't seem to have been 
touched for a long time which makes me think its unlikely that a newer kernel 
would help, but who knows...
Any suggestions apprieciated
