Can you please stop harping about this?  You have written essentially
the same mail over and over again without adding any new information.
First of all, your problem has nothing to do with networking, the same
thing will happen if you run your program from within screen, so it
seems to have more to do with ptys and how both screen and telnetd
sets them up.  
Second, it seems that your program does exactly what is expected.  Try
applying this patch to your example program and see what happens:
diff -u ./polltest.c.orig ./polltest.c
--- ./polltest.c.orig	Wed Nov  6 15:36:09 2002
+++ ./polltest.c	Wed Nov  6 15:35:54 2002

 {
     struct pollfd pf;
     pf.fd = STDIN_FILENO;
-    pf.events = POLLIN;
+    pf.events = POLLIN | POLLOUT | POLLERR;
     pf.revents = 0;
     (void)poll(&pf, 1, 0);
     if(pf.revents & POLLIN)
Each time you print the "POLLOUT = 3 POLLERR = 0" message, you fill up
the write buffer, and each time the write queue empties you will get
another SIGIO.  Now, this may not be what you want, but it seems to be
entirely within specs.
If you remove the fprintf(stderr, "POLLOUT... from your signal handler
you will not see the same effect as you are complaining about.  Your
measurements are interfering with what you are trying to measure.
