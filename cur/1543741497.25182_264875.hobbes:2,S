Then the question is begged, is there a common location where patches 
for these known bugs can be downloaded, diffed against the current 
stable kernel?  If not, there really should be.  As in the kernel.org 
stable directory should have a subdir in the 2.6.9 directory  called 
'bugfixes', with any patches that specifically fix known bugs that 
have been developed since the release placed there.  No new features, 
just the bugfix patches.  That would allow those of us who take the 
chance and bleed, to bleed a bit less.

Chuckle.  Nice play on words there, but I really do like this idea.  
Just one suggestion. When the snapshot to start the next patch series 
in the deveopment tree is done, take it from the latest, all bugfix 
patches applied, .bs kernel.
