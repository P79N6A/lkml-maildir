Subject: [2.6.20.16 review 19/28] sched: fix next_interval determination in idle_balance()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix massive SMP imbalance on NUMA nodes observed on 2.6.21.5 with CFS.
(and later on reproduced without CFS as well).
The intervals of domains that do not have SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE must be
considered for the calculation of the time of the next balance.
Otherwise we may defer rebalancing forever and nodes might stay idle for
very long times.
Siddha also spotted that the conversion of the balance interval to
jiffies is missing. Fix that to.
From: Srivatsa Vaddagiri <vatsa@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
also continue the loop if !(sd->flags & SD_LOAD_BALANCE).
Tested-by: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
It did in fact trigger under all three of mainline, CFS, and -rt
including CFS -- see below for a couple of emails from last Friday
giving results for these three on the AMD box (where it happened) and on
a single-quad NUMA-Q system (where it did not, at least not with such
severity).
