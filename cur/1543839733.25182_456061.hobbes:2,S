Putting swap on local disks really messes up the concept of stateless 
servers. I suppose you can do some sort of swap encryption, but
otherwise you need to scrub the swap partition on boot if you
re-purpose the hardware. You also then need to do hardware
configuration to make sure the local disks are all setup the 
same way across all server platforms so the common images can 
boot. 
Please don't require a hardware solution to a software problem.

I can't claim to represent a significant proportion of the target 
user base. However, stateless hardware is a powerful and useful
model. 
Cheers,
