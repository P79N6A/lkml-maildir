Visual details will differ, but I've been careful about maintaining
functional compatibility.  There was a phase of the development during
which I was mostly processing feature requests from people who wanted
features of the old system that I had not properly understood (such as
the NEW tag).  That phase ended almost a month ago.  Nobody who has
actually tried the CML2 tools more recently has reported that the UI
changes present any difficulty.
CML2 drops its configuration results in the same place, in the same
formats, as CML1.  So you should in fact be able to type `make menuconfig'
and `make oldconfig' with good results.  Have you actually tried this?

The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as
the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral
check against usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally,
even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist
and triumph over them."
