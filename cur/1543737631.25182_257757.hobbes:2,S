Please, would you try this patch below that I posted yesterday?
At the time I thought the trylock was hardly used so not urgent.
I've just now discovered that the standard SMP PREEMPT read_lock
- as in do_wait's read_lock(&tasklist_lock) for example - uses it
via one of those dreaded expansions that grep misses:
		if (likely(_raw_##op##_trylock(lock)))
I've been suffering the occasional leftover zombie from multiple
kernel builds precisely since the preempt-smp.patch went in; been
hunting it unsuccessfully in spare moments, yesterday noticed that
bug, today realize it's probably what I've been hunting - I'm
about to start my own tests again, can't be sure until tomorrow.

The i386 and x86_64 _raw_read_trylocks in preempt-smp.patch
are too successful: atomic_read() returns a signed integer.
