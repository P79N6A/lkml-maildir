If fsblock records and extent of 200MB, and writepage is called on a
page in the middle of the extent, how do you walk the radix backwards
to find the first dirty & up to date page in the range?

Well, O_DIRECT is french for deadlocks.  But I shouldn't have to worry
so much about evicting the pages themselves since I can tag the range.

Racing is fine as long as we don't deadlock or expose garbage from disk.

Jens is always interested in helping solve such debates.  It's a
