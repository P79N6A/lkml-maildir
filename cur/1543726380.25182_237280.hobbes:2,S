Yes please thank you.
>> I attach the "udf_test -scsi 1:0" output.
Attach did Not arrive here, sorry, please retry attach, at least to me, 
else publish on web.
Also please say if you can easily share a .iso image of the disc.  (Of 
course I imagine linux_udf and linux-kernel don't want that attached.)

I likewise find these interesting.  Don't know yet what they mean - 
again I say "Ben wrote udf.ko, not I".
I'll try to hunt for relevant claims in the 
udfct/src/udf_tester/udf_test (aka phgfsck) output when I receive it.
