You can put entries in your /etc/evms.conf file to tell EVMS to ignore certain 
disks (e.g. if you don't want it to examine sde). See the "legacy_devices" 
section (for 2.4 kernels) and/or the "sysfs_devices" section (for 2.6 
kernels).

If you have the "dmsetup" tool, you can issue a "dmsetup remove_all" command 
to deactivate all the DM devices. Just make sure all the DM devices are 
unmounted, or it won't actually release the underlying disks. Dmsetup is part 
of the device-mapper package, available at 
ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/dm/.

Again, you can add an "exclude" entry in your /etc/evms.conf if you want EVMS 
to ignore sda. Otherwise, have a look at
