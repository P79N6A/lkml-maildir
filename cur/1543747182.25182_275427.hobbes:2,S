It seems like there are two ways to adjust the headers.  We could move
the private headers to a new directory (include/kernel?), or we could 
move
the public headers to a new directory (include/linux-abi?).  I am 
willing to
work on some simple and trivial patches to begin doing either one, if we
can reach an agreement as to which one is preferrable (and what to call
the new directory.)

I think that the initial trivial patches would probably preserve a 1:1
mapping, just for compatibility.  On the other hand, future patches 
might
rearrange things to make more logical sense.

My initial suggestion would be to leave the types as-is, primarily for
the reasons in Linus' earlier email, but also for simplicity and to
prevent inadvertent breakage.

I would propose that if we decide to move the public headers instead of
the internal kernel headers, we autogenerate headers for installation
that have a #warning wrapper if __KERNEL__ isn't defined.
