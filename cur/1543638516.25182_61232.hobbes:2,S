That depends extensively on the nature of the card. IBM's mwave is
pretty intelligent so the logic is all kernel side. For a dumb winmodem
like the intel 8x0 AC97 stuff it actually makes little sense to put more
in the kernel than the most time critical bits (echo cancellation etc).
It depends what the modem does and doesn't handle itself
