Subject: kernel 2.4.6 compile failures in buz.c and htlmdocs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/7/13/26

kernel 2.4.6 , redhat 7.1 , gcc-2.96-85
Compilation of buz.c ( video grabberr stuff ) fails with some
error ( sorry , don't have it noted down ) if both Zoran chipsets
are selected as modules and "Support for IOMega Buz" is turned OFF.
and
"make htmldcos" fails at the kernel-api.sgml point.
It also fails for some other docs ( I found out by
uncommenting kernel-api from the Makefile , so it tried to
compile the next ones )
