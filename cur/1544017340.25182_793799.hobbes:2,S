100 wakeup pairs that all run and ping-pong between each other?
That creates 200 tasks with an average system load of 100.0, on a 
dual-core system. Is that a fair representation of some real workload, or 
just an unrealistic "gee, look, given enough tasks running I can overload 
the system _this bad_" example?
