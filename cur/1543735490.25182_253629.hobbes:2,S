Do you have PCI devices?  pnp-isa devices?  Ok, those all are
"hotpluggable" as far as the kernel is concerned.  They are loaded on
demand by userspace when the kernel sees the device.
If not, what kind of devices do you have?  The only place the
"on-demand" loading of modules doesn't work is for embedded systems that
have no way of discovering their devices, and need to be hardcoded in
the kernel.  But people are working on that :)

No, they want to plug in their device and have the proper module
automatically loaded, and then the device mounted and the icon show up
on their desktop all automatically.  With hotplug and its helpers (udev,
/etc/dev.d/ and HAL) this all works just fine today.

Fine, I'm not forcing you to do anything you don't want to do.  It
sounds like you like polling for your device nodes.  Great, live with
that, it is one way to do this :)

Change it to what?  A combative one?  Gladly :)

Please explain (with code) how to do that for something as "simple" as
the usb-storage driver.  Then we can continue this discussion.

Wrong.  Our goal is to make Linux "just work".  And that is what is
happening today.  This "wait for modprobe" stuff helps no one.

PCI and USB both use the same probe core code.  So it works the same :)
You think you are grumpy now, just wait till I add threads to the probe
code...
