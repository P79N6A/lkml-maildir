gee.
I think to a large extent this problem solves itself - the "more important"
architectures have more people using them, so they get more testing and
more immediate testing.
However there are gaps.  I'd say that arm is one of the more important
architectures, but many people who are interested in arm tend to shy away
from bleeding-edge kernels for various reasons.  Mainly because they have
real products to get out the door, rather than dinking around with mainline
kernel developement.  So testing bleeding-edge on some arm systems would be
good, I expect.
otoh, the platform we break most often is surely plain-old-PCs.  If it's
bugs you're looking for, I expect that dumpster-diving for as many
different PCs as you can and trying to get them to boot (let alone suspend
and resume!) would keep you entertained ;)
