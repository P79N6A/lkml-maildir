Ehh, the documentaion? Nope, I didn't really think _that_ part would be
controversial.
The change to BK? I sure as hell knew that was going to be "interesting",
yes absolutely. After all, it had been discussed at places like the kernel
summit etc.
But hey - I've never really cared about what other people think about what
I do. If I had, I'd have given up on Linux when Tanenbaum ridiculed it. Or
I wouldn't have done the big dentry change (which was a total disaster in
some peoples minds) in 2.1.x. Or the VM changeover in the middle of 2.4.x.
Or a million other things.
I do what _I_ think is right for the kernel, and while I tend to poll
people and listen to them, when the sh*t hits the fan it is _my_ decision.
You can't please everybody. And usually if you _try_ to please everybody,
the end result is one big mess.
