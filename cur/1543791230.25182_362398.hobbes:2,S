Go back and reread the thread in the archives. The short answer is that 
he who controls the code controls the decisions. I just fix it 
everywhere, since 250 is too fast for optimal battery life, too slow for 
optimal response or multimedia, and not optimal for any server 
application I run (usenet, dns, mail, http, firewall).
A perfect compromise is one which makes everyone reasonably happy; this 
is like the XOR of that, it leaves everyone slightly dissatisfied. ;-)
I'm convinced that Linus choose this value to make everyone slightly 
unhappy, so development of various variable rate and tick skipping 
projects would continue. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to have 
happened :-(
