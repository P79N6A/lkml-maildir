I'm pushing Linus some of the small bits right now (though no
feedback, so I'm backing off simultaneously)
I'm staying clear of the fbdev/console code for two reasons.
1. I'd rather James/Vojtech did this so that a, they get it right
   and b, it gives me more time to push Linus other bits.
2. Several Framebuffer driver authors want to push their relevant
   bits to Linus themselves. which is fine by me. (See 1b)
