Hi
Maximum file size on Linux is 2^41-2049.
What happens when you create file so large and overflow i_blocks
variable? (because that file will use more than 2^32 blocks, there are
indirect blocks too) There seems to be no check for that in
inode_add_bytes.
This bug applies to both 2.4 and 2.6.
Does anybody have so large raid to try it?
