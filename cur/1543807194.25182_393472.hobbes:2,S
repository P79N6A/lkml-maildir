umm, tricky.  This situation doesn't arise very often.
What you could do is to prepare the patches against Tony's latest tree. 
Then I can put them in -mm and Greg can drop them.  Once Tony merges up
with Linus I transfer the patches to Greg.
Or we put the patches into Tony's tree.
Either way - they'll be the same patches.  But it does mean that the
patches won't be merged into mainline until Tony merges up.  If that's a
problem then we'll need to think again.
