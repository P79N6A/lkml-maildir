Jeff,
I'm resubmitting the last cxgb3 patch series against netdev-2.6#upstream,
minus the first patch that you already applied and the last patch.
Here is a brief description:
-       Modify max HW Rx coalescing size
-       Log SGE doorbell Fifo overflow
-       Use Tx immediate data for offload packets whenever possible
-       RDMA can get internal mem info to workaround HW issues
-       More validity checks on connection ids
-       Stop MAC when a fatal error is detected
-       Log HW serial number
-       Update internal mem operating mode
-       Update engine microcode management, version is now 1.1.0
-       Update FW management, version is now 4.6.0
-       Ignore some HW errors until the HW is initialized
Cheers,
Divy
