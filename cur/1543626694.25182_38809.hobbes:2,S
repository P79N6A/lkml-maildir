  You're dreaming... people here boot their machines a LOT, sometimes even
intentionally. Anyone who runs cetting edge kernels is familiar with boots
;-)

  Bear in mind that the install for BSD often does some setup. However,
booting Linux on a laptop with a configured kernel and initrd file, the
INIT script start in about ten seconds.

  That really should take little time... slow boots are caused by two
things, a generic kernel which has everything possible included, and a
slow init script which not only does many things, but does them serially
and accompanied by many messages. Watching Redhat tap dancing and farting
through line after line of stuff is painful, and with a serial console on
a server, hooked to a 9600bps modem, you can not only get a cup of coffe,
but brew it and drink it as well.
  You should time your boot stages, time to get the kernel running vs.
time to do init, and where does the init script spend its time. If the
kernel boot itself is slow, build a configured kernel, use only what you
need, make most of it modules demand loaded from modules.conf (later), and
you should get boot time down to ten sec or less.
