From what I've heard, Arjans' user space daemon might be the way
things are going, it's at 
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/irqbalance/
 .
The other way that you might try is the irq load balance patch that Ingo
produced.  There is a patch that is from 2.4.20 at
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/2.4.20/
 and it is what I'm using at work on
our current Xeon systems (until I have the chance to test the user space
daemon at least).
Hope that helps.
