Hello,
Assume "int bla(struct sk_buff *skb)" is called from one of the five
netfilter hooks. And say,once you have the packet in your callback, you want
to create some dummy packet and send it along with original skb. How would
you do this?
Actually one solution would be to export symbol "ip_finish_output2" and then
use it for extra packet in the module. Then the return NF_ACCEPT would send
original skb out.
But how to do this without patching the kernel???
