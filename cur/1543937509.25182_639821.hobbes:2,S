This is the matrix the CPU uses when combining MTRR and PAT behaviour. 
It probably makes sense to mimic:
    | WB  WT  WC  UC
---+---------------
WB | WB  WT  WC  UC
WT | WT  WT  UC  UC
WC | WC  UC  WC  UC
UC | UC  UC  UC  UC
With the current PAT encoding:
WB = 00
WT = 01
WC = 10
UC = 11
... this is simply a bitwise OR.  This makes sense, since one of the 
bits denies delaying writes (WT, UC), and the other denies delaying 
reads (WC, UC).
