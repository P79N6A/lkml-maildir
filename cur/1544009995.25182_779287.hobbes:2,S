Sorry that after the mail of Viro, I checked again by recover a code
and recompile, but got no warning. But actually that code should not
be compiled at all.
So I checked again by fixing the code that should be compiled
(sound/core/sound.c), and can confirm that without the patch we got
warning like below:
sound/core/sound.c: In function 'snd_request_other':
sound/core/sound.c:91: warning: format not a string literal and no
format arguments
And with the patch, the warnings are all gone.
So Andrew, please consider taking the patch.
Thanks,
Quynh
