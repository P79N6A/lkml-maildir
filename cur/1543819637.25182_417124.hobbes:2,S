This has never been required; it's just the way standard policy was 
developed historically.
The current trend is to move policy development to the packages being 
protected, made possible through the recent modular policy work by Tresys.  
Several developer tools are being developed to help support this.
(SELinux developments of note are posted at:

and in the various blogs linked there).
