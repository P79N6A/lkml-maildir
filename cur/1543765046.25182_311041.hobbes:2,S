Subject: 2.6.12-rc2: Compose key doesn't work

Hi Vojtech.
I have mapped my right windows key to "Compose" in X:
Section "InputDevice"
         Identifier      "Keyboard0"
         Driver          "kbd"
         Option          "XkbModel" "pc104"
         Option          "XkbLayout" "us"
         Option          "XkbOptions" "compose:rwin"
EndSection
This worked fine upto  2.6.11.7, but doesn't under 2.6.12-rc2. The key 
doesn't seem to be doing anything anymore: "Compose-'-e" just gets me 
"'e" and so on.
X is X.org 6.8.1, keyboard is regular PS/2 keyboard, directly connected.
Rene.
