as much as i like gaurav's model, there are still some interesting issues
to be worked out.
there doesn't appear to be a way to create more than one event queue per
process.  for instance, you *can* emulate select() in the C library with
the new API, but what if the application also wants to use the new API?  
what happens when the select() emulator picks up an event that was
destined for a different event handler?  can it push the event back onto
the event queue?
