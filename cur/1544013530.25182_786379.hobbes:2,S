Mike?  These are x86-specific...

Yes, this removal is still in my queue.  I'll double-check that all the
archs have the new "cpumask_of_pcibus". (cpumask:replace-and-remove-pcibus_to_cpumask.patch "cpumask: remove the now-obsoleted pcibus_to_cpumask()").

Yep, we have the conversion for that too.  Mike, it's cpumask:convert-drivers_acpi.patch "cpumask: convert struct cpufreq_policy to cpumask_var_t."

Mike was tracking this; I think he has a script to set NR_CPUS small then
large and dump the changes.
Cheers,
