Hi, i am seeing the same behaviour of the Epox 8RDA3+ on 
2.4.22-pre5-vanilla.
Please note that only level-APICs seem to be affected.
We don't see these high interrupt rates anymore when APIC is disabled in 
the BIOS.
I also noted that the POST LED on the board flips between 94 and 96 
which it does not under WinXP where FF is displayed.
I have also a SATA Drive attached to the internal controller and under 
pre5 the box freezes if i do any serious amount of disk thoughput - for 
example using bonnie++. Maybe this is somehow related to this interrupt 
problem.
I experience freezes with current 2.5 kernels too.
WinXP is installed on the SATA Drive and rock stable, so this actually 
seems not to be a hardware problem per se.

If it were i would be desperate to hear why for my most frequented 
nameserver (>300queries/s) hardly even does 1000 interrupts/s. ;)
