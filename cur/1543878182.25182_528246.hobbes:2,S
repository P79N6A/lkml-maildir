Then I'd have to switch to EMACS ... no thanks!  ;)
At the risk of switching to a VI/EMACS flamewar (could that be
an improvement?) "let c_space_errors=1" shows the same sort of
thing ... albeit a bit more usefully, it just highlights the
single useless space character at the beginning of that line.
(Which starts "space-TAB-TAB-TAB".)

I last touched that header in 2005 ... next time I have reason to
touch it, I'll likely fix that little thing!   Patches accepted.  :)
This particular issue doesn't actually affect indentation, since the
tab trumps that space.  So it's a bit off-agenda for this particular
flamage.  I tend to fix such space errors whenever I trip over them;
e.g. "git show 438d6c2c015cf63bf7e9bdc2033d435433ac8455".
