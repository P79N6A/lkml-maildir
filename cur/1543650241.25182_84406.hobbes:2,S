Have you checked how glibc handles an executable with filesystem
capabilities? e.g. can an LD_PRELOAD hack subvert the privileged
executable?
I'm not sure what the current glibc security check is, but it used to be
simple *uid() vs. *euid() checks. This would not catch an executable with
filesystem capabilities.
Have a look at
http://security-archive.merton.ox.ac.uk/security-audit-199907/0192.html
I think the eventual plan was that we pass the kernel's current->dumpable
as an ELF note. Not sure if it got done. Alternatively glibc could use
prctl(PR_GET_DUMPABLE).
