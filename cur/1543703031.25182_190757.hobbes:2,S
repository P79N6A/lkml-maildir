Sorry, I am a noob about such things. Above option is enabled in my 
config, but I dunno how get the stack backtrace. Could you point to me 
to something helpful?
BTW, today the kernel didn't lock up. (But I didn't have the machine on 
the whole day.) Perhaps it will when I put in APIC  again. Was anything 
changed there recently?
