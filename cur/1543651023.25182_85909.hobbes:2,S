Hi,
Last week I was looking for a swap-space (mini) HOWTO and
didn't find one, so I threw one together quickly.  It's at
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/swap-mini-howto.txt
(Yeah, I know that this isn't a tough subject, but sometimes
people need something like this.)
I'm sure that it has some things that need to be corrected,
so if any of you could send such corrections to me, I'd
appreciate it.
Anyone have suggestions for where this should/could live,
like tldp.org or kernelnewbies.org etc.?
(other than where it is :)
Thanks,
--
