the first trace had general desktop load mixed into it as well - so 
while it's not interesting to AIM7 the BKL does matter in those 
situations and i'd not be surprised if it was responsible for certain 
categories of desktop lag.
The second trace was the correct 'pure' AIM7 workload which produces 
very little tty output. It is a quite stable workload and the trace i 
uploaded is representative of the totality of that workload. AIM7 runs 
for several minutes so there's no significant rampup/rampdown 
interaction either.
