Subject: patch for lm78 module integration
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Attached is my kernel integration of Erik Hendriks'
(hendriks@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov) lm78 module. This adds the sources to the
tree and configuration menu. It tests fine on my machine and every other
ATX Linux machine I can get my hands on, although hardware detection when
compiled-in sometimes fails. I wanted to make this a module-only option
but couldn't figure out how.
The patch is against 2.2.8. I haven't tried it against 2.2.9 but can't
think of any reason why it should fail.
Anyway, what this does is make a /proc/sys/dev/lm78 directory and put info
in it about:
CPU/case/ps fan speed
motherboard temperature
chassis intrusion (even when system is off! :)
voltage quality
Natually not all systems support the same options. It also allows you to
initiate a hardware reset via the lm78, but I'm not quite sure why you
would want to do this.
Anyways, let me know if I am sending this to the wrong place, or if my
submission does not meet some standard, or if there is anything else I
need to do!
