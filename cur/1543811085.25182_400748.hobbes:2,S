Alan, you didn't cc the pci mailing list on the original patch.
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0602.2/2673.html
You only fix pci_get_subsys; pci_get_class has the same bug.
If it is a bug, of course.  It's not clear to me whether it's permissible
to call pci_dev_put under a spinlock or not.  That boils down to whether
kobject ->release methods can sleep or not.  That isn't documented in
Documentation/kobject.txt and I rather think it should be.
