The idea was to make a point, that #include <linux/xxx.h> really is
a kernel/kernel aware application thing only.  It ought to reduce the
number of people who try to include kernel only stuff without knowing
that it is a nono most of the time.
It isn't all that hard to add the following lines to the Makefiles 
for an application that needs the kernel includes:
KERNELDIR=/usr/src/linux
CFLAGS+=$(KERNELDIR)/include
And then standardise on /usr/src/linux as the directory where the kernel 
includes for the current kernel reside on a distribution.  Those who 
compile multiple kernels on the same system should be savvy enough to
do "KERNELDIR=/usr/src/my-kernel/linux make" or modify the Makefile.
