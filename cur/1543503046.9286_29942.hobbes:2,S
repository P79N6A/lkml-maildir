An observation: a lot of questions and answers about RedHat specific kernels
which I can't see are relevant here.

Yes: I was not criticising RedHat for doing this, particularly.

No, but it renders bug reports about them pretty much useless on _this_
_list_. Bug reports for the official Linus trees and maybe Alan's tree are
relevant, because everyone can get and is likely to already have them. Most
people haven't got a clue what has been stuffed into the shipped kernels
provided with RedHat, Debian, SuSe, Caldera `Open' Linux. Bug reports and
questions for those kernels should go to the vendors; the vendors can then
report issues here if they discover them to be in the official tree as well.

I agree -- I'm not particularly criticising the existence of the patched
versions (after all, that's the whole point of OSS/GPL'd/free code); I just
don't think the bug reports belong here.

It's derived from the code that Linus makes available and has dubbed 'Linux',
yes. Can you imagine 'phoning up a car manufacturer and complaining about
some problem with the engine, and then adding "of course, I've customised it
myself quite extensively.."?

Again: I don't have a (particular) problem with the patches being applied.
I do object to seeing potentially vendor-specific bug reports on this list.

Yes: you've over-snipped my quote -- either that or I didn't make myself
clear. I was enquiring *if* RH only put the -ac patches into their kernels,
and suggested that if this was true then they should change the labelling.
As you have pointed out, that's not the case, so the suggestion's irrelevant.

I think so; there was a remark in one of Linus' posts a few days ago that
suggested Alan was dealing with 2.2.x patches; it makes sense, really: he
works for one of the biggest distribution vendors, so he's presumably going
to see a lot of bug reports.
