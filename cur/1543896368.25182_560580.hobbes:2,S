No, sorry.
My proposed solution is "figure out which console drivers can survive
being on while machines go down, and keep them on".
So, "no config needed" == "kernel always does the right thing, keeping
console during suspend when possible" == "possible to debug suspend
problems without having to change CONFIG_ or /sys/*".
