Subject: [PATCH 1/1] aacraid: don't assign cpu_to_le32(int) to u8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Good point, thanks. The intent of the management applications
utilization of this AIF report is to observe the LSB of the value of
integer value in BlinkLED. The actions of the cpu_to_le32 actually
breaks this and reports the wrong content in swapped architectures.
This attached follow-up patch is against current scsi-misc-2.6 *after*
the application of the 'don't assign cpu_to_le32(constant) to u8' patch
submitted by Stephen Rothwell which has already been taken by the -mm
tree. Inspection of other areas of the aacraid driver came up blank for
similar style bugs.
ObligatoryDisclaimer: Please accept my condolences regarding Outlook's
handling of patch attachments (inline gets damaged, use attachment).
