Yes, absolutely they are (I used to work for one such company that no
longer exists).  However, there's a catch -- the disk drive companies
are optimizing for the test as currently constituted, but the test keeps
changing.  So they're optimizing for version N-1 while the magazine is
publishing N.  Can't help it.  Ever heard of the Nyquist frequency?

Yup.  In general, it's capacity first, then reliability, then
performance.  No, wait, not quite; the FIRST criterion is the ability to
ship when you say you will.  If you make Dell late on shipping a bunch
of machines, you WILL feel the pain.
