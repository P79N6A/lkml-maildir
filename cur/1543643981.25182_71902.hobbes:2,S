Please don't change the semantics of module parameters.  All of my PCI
network drivers have used this name for years with the same semantics.
Arbitrarily changing is A Bad Thing.

Get rid of this.  See the MTU setting code in my driver release.

Did you miss reading the comment?  A Tx ring size of 64 is a bad idea.
Increasing the Rx ring size is fine, considering that most current
machines have plenty of memory and the kernel hasn't always been good
about keeping skbuffs available.
+MODULE_PARM(flowctrl, "i");
Flow control should be negotiated, not set.

Why change the symbolic names for the registers?

Uhmmm, again, read the comment.  This comment was originally with the
'txlock' variable
 	} else if (dev->mc_count) {
 		struct dev_mc_list *mclist;
-		memset(mc_filter, 0, sizeof(mc_filter));
+		int bit;
+		int index;
+		int crc;
+		memset (mc_filter, 0, sizeof (mc_filter));

-			 i++, mclist = mclist->next) {
-			set_bit(ether_crc_le(ETH_ALEN, mclist->dmi_addr) & 0x3f,
-					mc_filter);
+		     i++, mclist = mclist->next) {
+			crc = ether_crc_le (ETH_ALEN, mclist->dmi_addr);
+			for (index=0, bit=0; bit < 6; bit++, crc <<= 1)
+				if (crc & 0x80000000) index |= 1 << bit;
+			mc_filter[index/16] |= (1 << (index % 16));
 		}
Uhhmmm, perhaps calling a function to do the wrong-endian CRC and then
bit-reversing the result is not an improved way to do this?  That's why
there needs to be two Ethernet CRC functions -- so that you don't
need to bit bit-reverse the result.
