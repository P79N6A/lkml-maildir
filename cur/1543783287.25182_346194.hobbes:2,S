Hi,
I'm trying to write a host controller driver for a Arc hardware. I
need to know how nak
pid should be handled ? Hardware can automatically manage them, that means it
automatically retry the naked transaction. But since setup packet must
not be "NAKed" or hub
endpoint #1 returns nak pid when no events happen on its port, I don't
think I can use this
feature. But if I do it manually, what should I do when receiving a
NAK ? Should I retry the
transaction forever ? What status should I return to usb core (through
urb->status) when hub
endpoint #1 returns nak ?
Thanks.
