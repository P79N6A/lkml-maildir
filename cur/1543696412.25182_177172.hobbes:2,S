Can you give details ? It should work just fine, except if I broke
something in the past few days when getting G5 support in, but I didn't
have any other report of this, so...

Well, you are not supposed to use the zImage.chrp on a PowerMac,
and definitely not from yaboot.
It may have altered some open firmware settings in a bad way.
I suggest you reset your nvram first (hopefully, booting with
cmd-opt-P-R will do the trick).
Last I tried, then just netbooting vmlinux.elf-pmac worked fine
on all the "newworld" models I have here). For yaboot, you need
to load a plain vmlinux binary.
Ben.
