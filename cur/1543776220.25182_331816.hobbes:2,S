Okay, I've managed to figure out a reproducible test for this problem. Bring 
up a normal network interface, in my case wlan (my ipw2200 wireless). Start 
an openvpn session to any nearby host.
Without X loaded, running in multi-user text mode, I switched VTs to the 
second VT and started;
sleep 10; wget 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.0.tar.bz2
Then I switched back to the primary VT and waited. About 15 seconds later, I 
get:
 =======================
 =======================
 =======================
 =======================
 =======================
 =======================
 =======================
 =======================
[...]
Filling my screen up, page after page. Then eventually the kernel freezes and 
I get no more output. Now, I scanned through your realtime-preempt patch and 
only found a single place where this occurs; a small hunk in 
linux/arch/i386/kernel/traps.c show_trace().
        while (1) {
                struct thread_info *context;
                context = (struct thread_info *)
                        ((unsigned long)stack & (~(THREAD_SIZE - 1)));
                ebp = print_context_stack(context, stack, ebp);
                stack = (unsigned long*)context->previous_esp;
                if (!stack)
                        break;
                printk(" =======================\n");
        }
Something's been corrupted so badly that "stack" is always true; presumably it 
never reaches the bottom stack, and printk()s forever. That, or show_trace() 
is being called from multiple contexts.
Unfortunately, since this is called when the kernel crashes, it's impossible 
for me to capture any messages prior to this spam, if there even are any.
