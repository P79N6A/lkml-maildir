What sort of metrics had you in mind?  In general it's pretty hard to
account IO to specific processes.  Write is hardest: filesystem write IO
is usually triggered by the background flush services in the VM, not by
the processes writing to the files in the first place.  Even for reads,
if several processes try to read the same data at the same time, the
kernel will bring it into cache only once: who do you account the IO
against?
Buffer/page cache metrics would be easier to track than actual IO: the
number of buffers dirtied and the cache hit/miss rates would all be
fairly easy to track.
