It mean hostap_cs was identifying the card solely by its numeric ID
(0x0156, 0x0002) instead of the vendor strings.  Since that particular
numeric ID was used both by cards that are supported by hostap_cs and
those that are not, it cannot be used in hostap_cs.
Sebastian, please send me the output of "pccardctl ident" and I'll
submit the patch for hostap_cs.
