Unless they release it GPL, then it might be included in the kernel right? 
And "the nitty gritty details of making sure its driver software works
properly across such a range of rapidly changing development
environments" taken care of by the users of the driver.  They can even track 
it by CVS, by requesting all patches against the driver to be submitted to 
them.
They asked for official recommendations, shouldnt the primary recommandation 
not be to open source it, even if some vendors wont?
