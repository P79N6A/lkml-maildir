The recommended changes from Ingo, Alan, Stephen T, and other folks for
async IO all seem to work.  We have re-implemented using our own buffer
heads, but since the functions were all declared static, we simply
init'd our own from page allocated memory becuase we cannot call into
the buffer cache at this level.  Putting out a patch for this seems
wasteful since we have a valid workaround, so we will save everyone the
work.  2.0.38 still uses a sync model, so we are stuck with the older
versions with a sync interface (which is probably ok).  We are using our
own cache.  Someone had asked for some code, so we are going to put up
our LRU with NWFS 2.0 that uses async code.  Whomever owns the buffer
cache is welcome to take this code, study it, and implement what we need
in buffer.c.  I agree with Alan that we need to convert the
hotfix/mirror code (in nwvp.c in the 2.0 code base) as a RAID-like
driver, but not until the buffer cache gets changed.  A more general and
understandable async interface would be very desireable.
We thank the folks who helped us understand this problem.  There is
still an issues with the two LRU's balancing memory usage.  We would
like to use what's in Linux, so at the point the buffer cache get's
changed to support our exotic needs, we will throw away our LRU and use
the linux cache starting with the Linux version that addresses these
problems.
Thanks all,  
Jeff
