OpenVZ virtualizes kernel resources such as IPC making them per-VPS. 
Processes in VPS deal with such virtualized resources, so they 
efficiently should be migrated together. That's it - a whole container 
with its resources should be considered as a whole.
Signals are not virtualized in this manner since they are rather 
per-task resource, but OpenVZ introduces strict boundaries in kernel 
which make sure that no any 3rd task from another container (VPS) will 
be participating in the communication.
