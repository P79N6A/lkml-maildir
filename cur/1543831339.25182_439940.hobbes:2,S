No. Horrible.
I'm disgusted that somebody really would even consider something like 
this. It CHANGES SEMANTICS for the same name, which is a maintenance 
nightmare and a security bug. Now some patch assumes the new behaviour, 
gets back-ported, and is subtly broken.
If you want to get rid of the "user_mode()" thing, don't re-use the name 
with somethign that means something else.
Just do
	user_mode() -> user_mode_novm86()
instead, and leave the old macro entirely behind.
