I'm not sure, I did not see it on 2.4.2-ac18 until I started doing a lot
of X compiling, but I can't reproduce at will which makes this a little
harder.
I could try 2.4.2 the current 2.4.3-pre kernels from Linus if that would
help? (Though, as I said, it seems to happen semi-randomly, though more
when there is heavy disk activity.)
