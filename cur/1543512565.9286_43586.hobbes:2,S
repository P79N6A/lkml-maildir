Hello!
After about 45 days of running my 2.2.12 kernel, reporting the load
average went crazy, it always shows the value increased by 1. Though my
CPU is idle at 90--100%, the load is always around 1.00 -- 1.10 and
doesn't drop below 1.  (PII, single processor, 233MHz).
No kernel log about this strange behaviour, nothing else special that
could help you, so I don't really hope you can tell something useful, but
maybe...
Regards
Egmont Koblinger
