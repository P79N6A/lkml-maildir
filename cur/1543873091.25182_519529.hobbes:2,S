Correctly matching the section annotation on declarations and definitions
is needed by at least ARM.  We should ensure that we do this on all future
patches and we should also apply this patch if only for this reason.
(The ARM thing is a pain, because the compiler cannot check that the
definition and declaration match.  However something like sparse could do
so).
