I am not an expert in that area, but your stack trace made me curious.
Looking at the dis-assembly, line of code in question is:
	        if (likely(modemap[mode->encap] == NULL)) {
Register contents indicate that, its called as
	xfrm_register_mode(&xfrm4_tunnel_mode, AF_INET);
or
	xfrm_register_mode(&xfrm4_transport_mode, AF_INET);
(family is AF_INET).
The invalid deref is due to modemap = 0x7ff (RAX: 00000000000007ff)
Since its so easy to reproduce, can you add a printk before
this check to dump mode->encap and modemap, afinfo, family etc ?
Just curious ..
Thanks,
Badari
