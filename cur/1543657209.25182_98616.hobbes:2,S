Yes. Networking usually generates exclusive cachelines.
I'm aware of two special cases:
If multiple kmalloc buffers fit into one cacheline, then it can happen 
all the time. But the smallest kmalloc buffer is 64 bytes [assuming page 
size > 4096].
Is your cache line >= 128 bytes?
Or sendfile() of a mmap'ed file that is modified by userspace. That is 
the recommended approach for zerocopy tx, but I'm not sure which apps 
actually use that. IIRC DaveM mentioned the approach.
Additionally, the TCP checksum could catch the corruption and resent the 
packet - you wouldn't notice the corruptions, unless you use hw checksums.
