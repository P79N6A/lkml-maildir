hello rday,
In my view autoconf.h is the index of kernel you are using. By reading
autoconf.h you will know what Architecture, drivers is selected.
For example, If we are using some ARM based board, If you give me your
autoconf.h , I can replicate same environment as yours. If it is not
properly formatted it is very difficult to read and come to some
conclusion.
Thank you,
Jaswinder Singh.
