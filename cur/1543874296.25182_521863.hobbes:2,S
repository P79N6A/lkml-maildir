In principle, this would work.  But two things need changing, imho:
1. Don't inline the function.  kmem_cache_free() has only about 34 NULL
   callers, if my grep is reliable, so this case is arguable.  But in
   general, out-of-line functions are better than many extra
   conditionals pulled in through the inline one.
2. Switch the names.  According to Rusty's benchmark, the easiest way to
   use and interface should be the correct one.  Every new driver
   written by a rookie will call kmem_cache_free(), simply because the
   name seems simpler.
void kmem_cache_free_fast(struct kmem_cache *cachep, void *objp)
{
	/* old kmem_cache_free() */
}
void kmem_cache_free(struct kmem_cache *cachep, void *objp)
{
	if (likely(objp))
		kmem_cache_free_fast(cachep, objp);
}

Features come third.
Performance comes last.
Maintainability is easily forgotten.
