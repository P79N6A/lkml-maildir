Wrong.  Different subsystems -do- define their own events.  However,
different subsystems should use the same verbs for the same actions.  We
need consistency where possible.

Hotplug device insertion and network interface addition/removal are two
fundamentally different things.  Further, my code purposefully does not
wrap CONFIG_HOTPLUG around the /sbin/network code, because /sbin/network
has utility outside the domain of hotplug.
