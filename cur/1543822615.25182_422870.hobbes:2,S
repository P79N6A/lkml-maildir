Hello!
I am drawing some graphics (a group of lines) using DirectFb in a
geode sc1200 (kernel 2.4).
I discovered that when I disable 2D hardware acceleration (by changing
'/root/.directfbrc' and '/etc/directfbrc') it is FASTER than drawing
with 2D hardware acceleration enabled.
Can't figure why. Any ideas?
