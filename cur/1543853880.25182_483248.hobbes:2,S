  Hello,
  I've released cogito-0.18.2, bringing a couple of bugfixes and a trivial new
feature to cogito-0.18.1. Still nothing too groundshattering.
* cg-log does not follow history across renames anymore; it never really
  actually worked and was instead causing problems and random error
  messages. There needs to be git-core support for this funcionality,
  hacking it with a perl filter is bad design, so I'm not going to fix
  the filter (but I'd take patches if someone else did ;).
* Fix cg-init not letting you edit the initial commit message by default
* Fix cg-clone -l which would not setup alternates properly in some cases
* Fix cg-merge not picking the right base when following volatile branches
* Fix cg-log -d sometimes showing "% @" in diff output
* Some other minor fixes
* New cg-object-id -b to print the current branch name
* Documentation improvements (better documented ignoring mechanism,
  ~/.gitconfig mentioned, GIT_COMMITTER_* bogus information fixed, ...)
* Some testsuite fixes
  Happy hacking,
