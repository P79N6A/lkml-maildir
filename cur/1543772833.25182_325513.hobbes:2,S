I initially saw this with 2.6.12-rc1 and every version up through rc3. I
haven't tried with later versions. :-/ I initially reported here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111235814529008&w=2
The way that I got around it was to compile in my aic7xxx driver instead
of making it a module. I have also recently received an email from
someone saying that disabling module unloading would also solve it. That
very well may be true since I did run into another booting problem
(2.6.12-rc5) that disabling module unloading fixed :-/ I haven't had a
chance to go back and check this out though.
So to summarize: I have a dual 933 with aic7xxx compiled in to get
passed the problem described above. I have a dual 2.6 w/HT that I have
disabled module unloading to get passed another boot condition.
