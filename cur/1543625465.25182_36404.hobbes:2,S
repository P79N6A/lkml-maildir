It also says:
  This note outlines a procedure that ECN-Capable TCP implementations
  may wish to use in this case to ensure connectivity.  We are not
  suggesting that TCP implementations should be required to use this
  procedure.
If you don't like linux's behavior,
su
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
echo "net/ipv4/tcp_ecn=0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
If you don't like nifty.com's ECN violating behavior,
send them mail.
See the faq, as mentioned at the footer of all
