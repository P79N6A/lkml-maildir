You would copy them during the filesystem open.
My point was that in the generic vfs open there is no need to use copied
credentials so credentials copying can be restricted to network
filesystems with not-very-good designs.

This is in contradiction with your statement about credentials sent
during close.
The advantage of the model I described is that, with the exception of
connection management, it works exactly like a normal filesystem with
the exception of some totally inaccessible files due to server access
denies.
