DS9490 does not have anything except this chip and simple 64bit memory
chip,
so it is not needed to have any additional code.

obj-m: proprietary_module.o
proprietary_module-objs: dscore.o proprietary_module_init.o
Actually it will live outside the kernel tree, but will require ds2490
driver.
It could be called ds2490.c but I think dscore is better name.
