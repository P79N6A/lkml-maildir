    Yeah, better patch below
Good.

    Not unless you make it as readable as the current code.  Having magic
    appearing functions sounds cool, but beware that the cure might be
    worse than the disease.
But maybe I do not think that the current code is very readable.
Probably because just before fixing this compilation problem I had
to fix a different one where atomic_dec_and_lock was undefined,
and one finds a forest of #ifdef's in spinlock.h.
#ifdef's are evil. You have one, and there are two possible sources.
Easy and readable. You have two, and there are four. Already a small
effort to check that indeed all four combinations are OK. That was
what went wrong in the setup_per_cpu_areas case. You have three and
it is almost certain that someone forgets to check all possible
eight cases.
#ifdef's hide source from the compiler, so that when stuff compiles
for the developer it need not compile for the next person who comes
along. We have a kernel compilation project because of that.
So, if we can replace a certain type of #ifdef use by a different
formal construction, where all source is seen by the compiler,
that might well be progress.
