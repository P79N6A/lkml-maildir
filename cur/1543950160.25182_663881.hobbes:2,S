Peter,
The problem is that the page is slightly confusing in that it talks
about two different types of priorities:
"static priorities" which can only be non-zero (1 to 99) for RR and
FIFO policies.
"dynamic priorities" (aka "nice value") which can be (in userspace) -20 to +19.
I tweaked the wording in the description of SCHED_BATCH a little to
make this clearer.
Thanks,
Michael
