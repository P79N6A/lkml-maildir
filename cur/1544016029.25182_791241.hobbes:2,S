I planned on using the exact same algorithm as is used currently. I believe
the current->signal->pacct structure holds system and user CPU time which
is copied into the log ac_stime and ac_utime entries respectively in
kernel/acct.c/do_acct_proces() thus:
      ac.ac_utime =
encode_comp_t(jiffies_to_AHZ(cputime_to_jiffies(pacct->ac_utime)));
      ac.ac_stime =
encode_comp_t(jiffies_to_AHZ(cputime_to_jiffies(pacct->ac_stime)));
The log ac_etime is elapsed time (which is what I assume you mean by wall
time) and is calculated as current_uptime - process_start_time
(paraphrased) in the same function.
Cheers,
Pax.

Agreed and this sounds sensible.

Are you planning to update the log based upon wall time or cpu used ?
