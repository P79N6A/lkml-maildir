Yes sure. I meant, if the file was opened without FMODE_WRITE, then
mmap(PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED) doesn't actually set VM_SHARED, it only
sets VM_MAYSHARE.
(this looks understandable, but means that !VM_SHARED doesn't necessary
 imply the possible cow).

OK, thanks a lot. I was afraid I missed some "obvious" reason why we
can't do this.
