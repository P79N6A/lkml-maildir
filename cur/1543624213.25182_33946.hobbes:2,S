They redid the same really nasty merge with the old tools, with Sun's
file merge, and the new filemerge.  It was a bit more than 18x faster
with the new file merge.
This same customer site, which hacks the kernel by the way, claims that 
well over 90% of their BK usage is spent merging, so the productivity 
gains in merging are translated almost 1:1 into wall clock gains.
