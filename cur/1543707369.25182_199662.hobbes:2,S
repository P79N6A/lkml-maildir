Updated patchset
http://kernel.kolivas.org
Description:
am6
Autoregulates the virtual memory swappiness.
batch8
Batch scheduling.
+Updated batch logic to return cpu to non batch tasks asap
+Numa compile
iso2
Isochronous scheduling (non privileged low latency non-RT scheduling)
+Bypass file i/o and idle detection in interactivity estimation of SCHED_ISO 
tasks 
smtbase3
Base patch for hyperthread modifications
+Added SMT_SIBLING_IMPACT to reflect the percentage impact running a task on a 
sibling has. When a merge with sched_domains is done, this will be 
configurable for each architecture as this value will decrease as SMT designs 
improve.
smttweak2
Tiny performance enhancements for hyperthreading
smtnice4
Make "nice" hyperthread smart
+Minor bugfix
+Support for SMT_SIBLING_IMPACT to allow +niced tasks to run proportionately 
longer according to the value of SSI
smtbatch4
Make batch scheduling hyperthread smart
cfqioprio
Complete Fair Queueing disk scheduler and I/O priorities
schedioprio
Set initial I/O priorities according to cpu scheduling policy and nice
sng204
Supermount-NG v2.0.4
I've also synced the bootsplash patch with these but it doesn't complete 
booting on some machines so I've left this in the experimental dir for 2.6.3.
