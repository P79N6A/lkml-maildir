Actually, we see the problem more with IDE than SCSI, but that's
neither here nor there.

It's an SMP (and only when your system crashes on a CPU other
than 0) problem.  I did some more checking of this to verify the
specifics of the behavior.  Thanks for the sarcasm, though. :)

Someone's sent me a suggestion as to how to get around this issue.
It goes back to turning off the disable_local_APIC() behavior for
one (if I'm writing pages out), but secondly to avoid doing any
TLB flushing of CPUs that are stopped.
The problem is, on SMP configurations where one CPU's
task causes a panic() condition to another CPU's task (let's say
they are playing with the same list of structures in the kernel),
I need to stop all CPUs except the one panic()ing, and let him
be responsible for dumping system memory, so I can at least try
to figure out what the other CPU's task did to cause the problem.
A hack way around this is to stop job scheduling, but it doesn't
help if you want to catch the state of the task that caused the
problem on another CPU just after it happens.  Secondly, because there
is no disk driver to dump raw to disk (I've written one, but
not for SCSI -- only for IDE), you require interrupts and must
use the current block driver.  Sure, brw_kiovec() is nice, but it
isn't raw I/O without kernel interrupts.
All I wanted was clarification as to why it was added in the first
place, and whether there was a better way around the scenario.
I think Ingo added the code, but I never heard back from him.
Thanks for the response.
