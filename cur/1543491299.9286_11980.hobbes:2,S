Because that's all they _have_ to do to conform to the letter of the
standard. Standards aren't written into thin air, careful consideration is
given to what might be impossible (or very dificult, or just expensive) to
do, and consider the possibility of letting implementors off the hook where
reasonable. That's the "convenient" in my statement above.
In this particular case (vfork(2) use in glibc) you should note:
- glibc is _not_ just for Linux, it has to work on every POSIX (and perhaps
  even less) platform. So it can not assume things that "usually work" or
  "reasonable implementations provide it"
- You _have_ fork(2) for the cases where vfork(2) isn't enough. Cut the
  kernel developers some slack here: They implement what is _efficient_ to
  do _right_ for vfork(2).

Neither does vfork(2), as it is allowed to make vfork(2) simply an alias
for fork(2). If you want shared address spaces, use threads.
