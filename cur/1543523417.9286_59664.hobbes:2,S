Subject: Corruption caused by umount not flushing the buffer cache.

There's a problem in 2.2.14 (and possibly 2.3.40) caused by do_umount (in 
fs/super.c) calling invalidate_inodes() but not invalidate_buffers(). I 
believe this only affects storage which is shared between boxes either on a 
SCSI bus or a SAN, but it's biting me:
If I mount the filesystem on Node A, modify it and unmount it.  Then I mount 
the same filesystem on Node B, modify it and unmount it.  Finally I mount it 
again on node A; because the buffers weren't invalidated on Node A this node 
will potentially have stale buffers in the buffer cache which will corrupt the 
filesystem if I try to modify it again.
I know I can get around this by forcing a BLKFLSBUF ioctl to the device after 
the unmount but this strikes me as a bug in the linux umount semantics which 
will bite more people than just me as linux enters the SAN arena.
I think the fix is simple (and I attach it below).
