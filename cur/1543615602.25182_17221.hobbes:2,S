IDE Scales fine to 8 Channels (aka 8 Drives). Anything more than 8 Drives on
an HBA is insane anyway.
I love the FC-to-IDE(8) Solution. You get Hardware Raid with 8 Channels, each
drive a didicated channel, thats much more reliable than usual 2 or 3 channel
SCSI Configurations.
Do you realy run more than say 10 hard disk devices on a single SCSI Bus,
ever?
