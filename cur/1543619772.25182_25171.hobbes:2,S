Just checking - you realize that getting the super_block includes out of fs.h 
is easy, right?  In fact I already did it in my Unbork fs.h (1..4) set of 
patches last month, at least I set a pattern using ext2 as an example, which 
is trivially extended for al filesystems.  Now, I'm just waiting for one of 
two things to happen: Al to decide he's finished mucking around in there and 
I can submit the patch to Linus, or Al will feel threatened again and submit 
a similar patch to Linus.  Either way we win, because the kernel gets better 
right?  (Except that the second scenerio creates considerably more friction 
that necessary, as we saw last week.)

You bet it is, you are preaching to the choir.

Oh I know all about it, because I first did a version of this for myself
almost a year ago, and the complilation speedup was *remarkable*.  That's not 
even the biggest thing, I just find it much easier to work with and feel 
better about it when the kernel doesn't doesn't have its thumb tied to its 
nose.
