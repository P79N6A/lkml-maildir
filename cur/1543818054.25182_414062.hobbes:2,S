I like your idea. But, in the function, I think we need to care
lowmem_reserve too.
Since __vm_enough_memory() doesn't know zone and cpuset information,
we have to guess proper value of lowmem_reserve in each zone
like I did in calculate_totalreserve_pages() in my patch.
Do you think that we can do this calculation every time?
If it is good enough, I'll make revised patch.

I think this is another point which we should improve.
Best regards,
