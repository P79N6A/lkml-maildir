I doubt it. First of all, then we'd better make i_rdev dev_t. Right now
we have it kdev_t and it makes absolutely no sense that way. If we
only use it for stat() (when we convert it to dev_t) and for keeping the
information between mknod/read_inode and open() - why bother converting it
to anything? Currently it's used by drivers to identify the device.
->dev.{block,char} is perfectly fine for that and gives more information
without extra lookups, etc. And that's it - nothing else cares for
->i_rdev. What you suggest is reusing it so that we had a way to get
the right ->dev.{block,char} when we open. Fine, but there's no reason
to tie it to kdev_t (or to have kdev_t, for that matter).
The real thing is inode->dev. Notice that for devfs (and per-device
filesystems) we can set it upon inode creation, since they _know_ it
from the very beginning and there is absolutely no reason to do any
hash lookups. Moreover, in these cases we may have no meaningful device
number at all.

OK, but see comments above.

Aye.

Do we really want a separate queue for each partition? I'd rather have
disk_struct created when driver sees the disk and list of partitions
(possibly represented by struct block_device) anchored in disk_struct
and populated by grok_partitions().
Then disk_struct would keep the queue _and_ ll_rw_block could do all
remapping, so that driver itself wouldn't know anything about the
partitioning.
I have a half-baked patch for that (circa last Spring) and Ben LaHaise got
suckere^W^Whad kindly volunteered to try porting it to current tree...
