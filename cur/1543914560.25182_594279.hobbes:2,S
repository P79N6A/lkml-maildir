btw., just in case it was not obvious, i'll repeat my older assessment 
of your patch: the general picture approach looks good to me and the 
code is upstream-worthy.
( suggestion: if you want more people to test it then you might want to 
  do some add-on "put all users into separate groups" patch and .config 
  option - which could be tried without people having to know anything 
  about container setup. )
