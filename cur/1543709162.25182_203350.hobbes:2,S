Eek, that does not bear good.  Somebody else mailed me this patch, so 
would you mind sending me your orriginal patch for comparison?
And I assume that the scsi_unregister call should in fact not be in 
there?  If I understand it correctly there is either some function that 
first calls adpt_release (from the address given in the info struct) and 
then scsi_unregister, or scsi_unregister itself calls us.
Btw, none of this code was yet incorporated into the 2.6.3 kernel which 
is why I started looking around for patches and actually looking at 
making the changes myself.  Btw, I also note that a couple of free's has 
moved around - this gives me the idea that either a memory corruption 
bug has been fixed (which leaves at least two of our machines in danger 
of crashing) or a memory leak has been introduced.  Or is it simply that 
memory handling has been optimized a bit?
