Neither the GPL nor the kernel's COPYING file restricts anyone
from making kernel changes.  In fact, the GPL expressly permits
anyone to modify the kernel.  So how the syscalls get there is
of zero relevance here.
Now, the syscall interface itself appears to be expressly exempted
from any GPL considerations by the kernel's COPYING file:

Heh.. but the lawyers are not completely out of their hourly fees yet,
since Linus unfortunately included that little undefined "normal" word.
