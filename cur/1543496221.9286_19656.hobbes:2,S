There is driver which could be usable for this, it is called network
block device. So you basically take two identical machines, connect
them with fast network.
Each machine sees raid1 over /dev/sda and /dev/nd0 pointed to other's
machine disk.
When one of machines fail, the other takes here IP address, runs fsck
on /dev/sda [which has pretty current data due to raid1 from other
machine] and mounts it without raid.
