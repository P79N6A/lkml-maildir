[Already announced to linux-raid, but I thought it might get wider
distribution in this list.]
For those that don't know, I've been working on adding RAID-6 (dual
failure recovery) to the md system for a while.  It started out as a
project because the math was interesting, and Penguin Computing for
donated a very much needed test system (thanks!)
Well, at least I have a piece of code that passes my relatively simple
functionality tests.  Still, that's news, and this is the first RAID-6
snapshot that isn't *known* to be broken :)
I can at least mount filesystems, read and write data, reboot the
system and have the data still there, with 1 or 2 disks lost, and do a
reconstruction once the drives are added back in.
New development snapshot at:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6-20031224c-experimental.tar.gz
Please test it out and let me know how badly it sucks :)
At some point I'll try to run some benchmarks.  There is also a lot of
optimization still to be done.
