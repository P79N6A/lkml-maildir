Everything seems fine when I use vanilla 2.4.20.  Hightower from #kernelnewbies
tells me that there is a known bug in -ac with Radeon DRI and 2.4.20-ac1, but
that as far as he is aware, the bug occurs regardless of the large memory 
setting.  However, since the bug goes away when I switch to the linus tree, I
will assume that it is the same bug.  If I see otherwise when the known bug is
supposedly fixed, I will post further information.
