It would be useful to have a few global options perhaps included in /proc
(or wherever) on all kernels. By global I mean those which affect the
entire kernel, like preempt or smp, rather than driver options. We already
note 'tainted,' so this is not a totally new idea. It would seem that most
of the processor options could fall in this class, MCE, IOAPIC, etc.
If the aim is to speed stability, putting any of the "whole config"
options in and defaulted on might be a step toward that.
