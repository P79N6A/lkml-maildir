No. I am afraid :\, I think that I can't reproduce this problem easily. You
see at the log files that it happened after some hours of uptime, and I did
some bttv grabbing for an hour or so. I used 2.4.0-pre, pre12, pre11, pre9.
pre12 was nice, I had no problems with pre11 either (well except for the
instability of nvidia binary drivers, but I'm not using that for a longer
period now). I did bttv video grabbing only on 2.4.0pre.
I didn't backup recently, but I was lucky:) The most damaged areas were
/usr, /etc managed to get untouched, and my home dir is fine. e2fsck did
clear a lot of inodes, but I managed to boot the system and reinstall most
of the stuff. I'm backing up stuff now, and when I finish (10G will be a bit
slow with a 4x burner), I'll start playing with fire again.
I just remembered that I booted 2.4.0-pre after the disaster, and it
mentioned something about not being able to access sectors beyond the end of
the device. I booted 2.2.17 after, and ran e2fsck.
Could it be that I experienced IDE DMA timeout problem?
