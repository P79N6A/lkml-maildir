For things like this, we need to see (perhaps a separate email in the 
same thread) your build details:  config, arch, compiler version, etc.
This warning does not appear on x86 or x86-64 here, with the current 
version of gcc.  And I'm not so sure we want to be adding these markers 
for older versions of the compiler, or for what is ultimately a 
temporary [situation | configuration] in the grand scheme of things.
I paid careful attention to my recent set of uninitialized_var() markers 
(now upstream), making sure that they persisted across several compiler 
versions, ensuring the warning was not a temporary optimizer bug quickly 
remedied.
I hope to encourage similar diligence in others :)  These markers have 
the very-real potential downside of hiding bugs, so they should be used 
sparingly.
