Hi,
I don't have any comments on the microcode updating,
but on 1/16/2000, Linus wrote that "sysctl is deprecated"
(entire quote is below).
So I'm just trying to understand if there's been a
flip-flop on using sysctl and what is the current
advice.
Thanks,
Randy

The thing to do is to create a
	/proc/drivers/<drivername>/ 
directory. The /proc/drivers/ directory is already there, so you'd
basically do something like
	create_proc_info_entry("driver/mydriver/status", 0, NULL,
mydriver_status_read);
to create a "status" file (etc etc).

sysctl is deprecated.  It's useful in one way only: it has some nice
functions that can be used to add a block of /proc names.  However, it
has other downsides (allocating silly numbers etc - there should be no
need for that, considering that the /proc namespace is alreayd a
perfectly good namespace).
