Right.  filemap_xip.c allows for an XIP filesystem.  The only
filesystem that is supported is ext2.  Even that requires a block
device driver thingy, which I don't understand, that's specific to the
s390.

Don't sweat it, it has to do with the way filemap_xip.c works.

XIP works fine on things like arm and mips.  However there is mixed
support in the mainline kernel for it.  For example, you can build an
XiP kernel image for arm since like 2.6.10 or 12.  Also MTD has an XiP
aware mode that protects XiP objects in flash from get screwed up
during programs and erases.  But there is no mainlined solution for
XiP of applications from the filesystem.  However there have been
patches for cramfs to do this for years.  They are kind of messy and
keep getting rejected.  I do have a solution in the works for this
part of it -
