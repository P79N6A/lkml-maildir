Well, the economics of the UK is very different than the US.  Besides,
aren't their laws against that sorta stuff over there?

It's not admins, it's less stupid users -- you can group "less" and "stupid"
however you want.  As for trapping SMTP traffic... uh, HELL NO.  If you
ever want to piss off your customers, start getting in their way.  I'd
like to see just how you think you could validate the src/dst/headers?
The "From" address doesn't have to match the network provider to be
valid and only the end-point can validate the "To".  Are you gonna
reject my mail because my clock is wrong so the dates in the header are
off?
Don't get me wrong, I hate spam.  The only simple way to prevent spam is
to kill the people from whom it is originating -- that means the monkey
with the keyboard pushing the send button.
