Great, I stand corrected.  Looks like 2.5 code is ancient then?
comments on the 2.4 code:
* the 1000us delay in ahc_reset needs to be turned into a sleep, instead 
all paths to that function [AFAICS] can sleep.  likewise for the huge 
delay in ahc_acquire_seeprom.
* 400ms worst case udelay() is in ahc_clear_critical_section is kinda 
annoying [but I suppose it can be lived with, if the average is a lot 
less than that :)]
* the delay in ahc_init should be replaced with a sleep
* PCI posting?  (aic7xxx_core.c, line 1322, the last statement in the 
function...)
                 ahc_outb(ahc, CLRINT, CLRSCSIINT);
I'll look it over some more later.
