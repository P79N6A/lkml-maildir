Subject: generic sleeping locks?

Allow me to display my ignorance a moment.
Are there blocking lock primitives already defined somewhere in the
kernel?
It just seems that 
while( lockvar )
	sleep_on( &lockwaitq );
along with its various permutations would be commonly used and worthy of
being made into a generic sleep lock.  A few blind greps through the
source didn't find anything that caught my eye.
If there aren't, would a patch to add them be of interest to anyone? 
Input on design details welcome.
TIA,
Eli
