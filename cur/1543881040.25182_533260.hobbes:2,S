NACK.
Believe me, I would *love* to nuke the BKL from reiserfs, but a search
and replace of this nature is just wrong. reiserfs_write_lock() using
the BKL isn't an accident - it depends on its nesting properties. If you
did try to boot this kernel, you'd deadlock pretty quickly.
This one has been on my TODO list for a long time. Interestingly, I've
been doing reiserfs xattr development recently using 2.6.21-rc7-git2,
and I'm not seeing any of these messages.
