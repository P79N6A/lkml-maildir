Today, in the Amazing Adventures of Stall-man, Stallman decried Microsofts effort to move to a Trusted Computing platform as treacherous computing.  Palladium, the name Microsoft gave to the project, would bring the same trusted computing architecture used by the military and intelligence agencies to your everyday desktop PC.  Yeah, you heard that right.  Microsoft is trying to bring military-level security to your desktop PC.  Now everybody wants that, right?  Well, not Richard M. Stallman.
For those of you who dont know, Richard M. Stallman is a lonely, homely, pot-smoking atheist who has spent the last 20 years of his life fighting the free enterprise system with his own tax-exempt organization, the Free Software Foundation, Inc., and a project he calls "GNU" (pronounced g-NEW).  As a BA graduate in Physics, he continuously demonstrates that he does not grasp basic economic concepts, like the cost of research and development, by trying to convince everyone to give their software away for free.
