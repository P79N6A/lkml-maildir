Has the check to see if the BIOS is old than very recent been removed? I
used to get a message that the BIOS was too old, I believe that's what
prompted the acpi to enable the local apic. Sorrt, I've been running that
feature since 2.5.3x or so and I just carried it forward.

Works fine for me, system stays up for 30-40 days when I let it... I also
run softdog to catch hangs in user mode but not in the kernel. That also
works.
