I don't know that much about ia32 assembler. I don't have any ia32 boxes.
But you use the `cc' constraint to tell gcc that the inline asm may have
changed the condition codes. Some instructions don't change cc, others do. On
PPC, you can even decide yourself whether you want an instruction to influence
the cc or not.
