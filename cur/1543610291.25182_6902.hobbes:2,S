That's already what initrd does.  What would make this interesting --
and why, at least in my opinion, Multiboot is the wrong solution -- is
to make the bootloader smarter about what it loads.  If the boot
loader can *probe* for the device- and filesystem drivers it needs and
thus dynamically compose the kernel in a dynamic manner, then it is
suddenly a win; not sooner.  Multiboot doesn't do that, although it
might be possible to build on top of it to get there.
