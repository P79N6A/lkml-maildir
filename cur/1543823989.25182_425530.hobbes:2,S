Subject: [PATCH (take #2)] EDD isn't EXPERIMENTAL anymore
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Oops.
Resend with Kconfig comment change too.  It also occured to me that
!IA64 is a lousy check, EDD is really i386 and x86_64 only, it's
clearly not useful for ppc, alpha, etc.
Would anyone object to a chance for that too?

Lots of people use this.  Apparently RH has for over 18 months so lets
drop EXPERIMENTAL.
