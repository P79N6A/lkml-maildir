Hi David, Larry.

Larry: In case you didn't know, the URL is in my signature block. I'm
just revamped most of those pages, but here's a quick analysis of the
kernels and patches that currently appear to exist:
 1. There are lots of holes prior to 0.99.14 where released
    kernels appear to no longer exist. This includes most of
    the 0.99.13 subseries, of which only 0.99.13 and 0.99.13k
    now appear to exist.
 2. For most of the kernels prior to 0.99.13, patches were
    apparently never released, so one would have to use the
    individual kernel tarballs as the necessary sources.
 3. Although the actual kernel tarballs for 1.2.10 and 1.3.0
    both still exist, the original patch between them does
    not. However, it would not be difficult to recreate it.
 4. With the sole exception pointed out above, all kernel
    tarballs and patch files from 0.99.14 to date still exist.
Based on the above, it should be possible to build up a repository
showing the complete history of all kernels from 0.99.14 to date, but
it would probably be meaningless to include any earlier kernels.
Note that the current set of links refer exclusively to kernels and
patches available on ftp.kernel.org and do *NOT* include any of the
various author series (such as the -ac kernels). I will be adding
other prime release kernels to that list as and when I find them on
the Internet, but the pages include details of kernels and patches in
my collection that are not on ftp.kernel.org (identifyable by there
being no link for the relevant "Version" or "Patch From" number
respectively).
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
