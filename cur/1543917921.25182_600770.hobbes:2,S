Hell f*cking NO!
You security people are insane. I'm tired of this "only my version is 
correct" crap. The whole and only point of LSM was to get away from that.
And anybody who claims that there is "consensus" on SELinux is just in 
denial.
People are arguing against other peoples security on totally bogus points. 
First it was AppArmor, now this.
I guess I have to merge AppArmor and SMACK just to get this *disease* off 
the table. You're acting like a string theorist, claiming that t here is 
no other viable theory out there. Stop it. It's been going on for too damn 
long.
