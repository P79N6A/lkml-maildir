OSB4 chipset system, some memory areas marked write combining with the
processor memory type range registers. A long time ago Dell (I
think) reported corruption from this and submitted changes to block the
use of write combining on OSB4. The question has arisen as to whether
thats a known thing, and if so which release of the chipset fixed it so that
people can only apply such a restriction to problem cases not all OSB4.
