I think for net devices it actually makes sense; most of the time we are
not trying to remove them, so the refcounting is simply overhead.  We
also don't alloc and free them very often.  The size issue is not really
an issue since we only map for each CPU, and even better: if a bigref
allocation can't get per-cpu data it just degrades beautifully into a
test and an atomic.
Now, that said, I wanted (and wrote, way back when) a far simpler
allocator which only worked for GFP_KERNEL and used the same
__per_cpu_offset[] to fixup dynamic per-cpu ptrs as static ones.  Maybe
not as "complete" as this one, but maybe less offensive.
Rusty.
