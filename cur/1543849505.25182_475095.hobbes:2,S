Ok. So no memory on node 0? Then my patch to reenable fallback in the slab
should have worked but it did not. Could you retest with the patch that 
Will tried? If that is not working the comment out the 3 lines with 
__GFP_THISNODE in get_page_from_freelist. That will reenable fallback 
globally. If that does not work then I doubt that this is my issue.

I do not get it. You first mark all pages on node 0 then we run the bootup 
code and later we shift those pages into node 0? So the slab bootstrap is 
running when all pages are marked as being part of node 1 then later we 
switch those pages under it to node 0?

The fix that I posted yesterday should have reenabled fallback in the 
slab during bootstrap and should have made the system work. Here it is 
again:
