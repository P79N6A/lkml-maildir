That is, the "status" polling which you disabled??  If so, please
update this comment ...

Looks basically OK to me, although I'd rather see the two patches
you posted on 27-August be merged into it before an upstream merge.
(To use normal MII constants, and handle max size frames.)

real Ethernet adapters and usbnet.  :)
Speaking of which ... isnt this driver missing a hook to make
the MII stuff visible through ethtool?
