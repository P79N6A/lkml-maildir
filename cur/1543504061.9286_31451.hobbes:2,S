Last year, after having developed the linuxthread debug support in GDB,
I made a small proposal to allow a flexible support for multithreaded
core while letting the thread manager decide what to do on signal receiving
(actually whether or not it wants to implements the POSIX semantics):
The basic idea is to configure for each thread what to do when a core dump
is required (namely whether to actually dump the core to a file, or to
write the faulting context in its own thread memory).
The mechanism will be the following, mainly implemented in user mode in the
LinuxThread package:
1) For each thread created, a special area is reserved in the shared memory
	for a fault context to be written by the kernel.
2) All threads but the thread manager uses a special sysctl() to specify
	that instead of doing a core dump, the fault context must be written
	at the reserved area.
3) Under a fault, a thread context is written at its own place, and the
	thread manager is signaled that a thread has died with a signal
	(no core is actually dumped, but the fault context in the memory);
	the thread manager then implements the POSIX behaviour by broadcasting
	the signal to all threads but itself.
4) All threads receive the signal and the kernel writes their current context
	in their reserved area.
5) The thread manager waits for the death of all threads, and then sends to
	itself the received signal, which actually dumps the core (since the
	thread manager has not required special handling of core dump).
6) GDB is actually updated to handle the context of all linuxthread not from
	the multithreaded core format, but from the context area reserved
	for each threads but the thread manager. Notice that even if not
	modified, GDB is able to read a correct core format and to tell which
	signal has been received, but is unable to give more informations.
The main advantage of this schema is that the core is not multithreaded within
	its own format, but via a special format fixed by the user-level
	package. The kernel does not need to know anything about the core 
	format for multithreaded applications (It may also work for core
	formats that do not handle multithreads, like a.out). The modifications
	in the kernel are very limited, since the behaviour in the signal
	handling functions are preserved. Only the core-dumping mechanism
	has to be modified to handle the fact that the context writing is
	required instead of the core dump (plus the sysctl() handling).
Hope this will give some implementation ideas,
