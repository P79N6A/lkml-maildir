Certainly the current practice of notifying CPU_UP_PREPARE and CPU_ONLINE
in the same order as CPU_DOWN_PREPARE and CPU_DEAD is just asking for lots
of bugs.  The "up" notifications should proceed in the same order as the
services were initialized at boot time, and the "down" notifications need
to proceed in the opposite order.
As things stand, if service B relies on service A, either service B must
go without during the CPU-removal process or services A and B must know
way too much about one another.  Either approach is an excellent way
to breed endless quantities of bugs.  If "down" notifications instead
proceeded in the opposite order from boot-time initialization, such
dependencies would be resolved automatically, and life is -much- simpler.
So why are we doing hard things the hard way here???  ;-)

The idea being to essentially suspend the system to RAM, remove the
CPU and then unsuspend it?  Seems like quite high overhead -- or am
I misunderstanding the proposal?
						Thanx, Paul
