Jussi,
there is one more thing in the -K2 patch that could cause your problems.
In kernel/softirq.c, you'll find this line:
//__initcall(spawn_ksoftirqd);
please uncomment it - this was just a debugging thing that was left in the
patch accidentally. I've made a -K3 patch that has this fixed. Do you
still see the audio problems?
