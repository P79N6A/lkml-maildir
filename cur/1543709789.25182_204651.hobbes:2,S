mlock() does not guarantee things not hitting magnetic media, just as
mlock() doesn't guarantee that the physical address of a page doesn't
change. mlock guarantees that you won't get hard pagefaults and that you
have guaranteed memory for the task at hand (eg for realtime apps and
oom-critical stuff)
