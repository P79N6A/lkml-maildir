But I don't see why this needs to be a two step process:
       module support calls mod->cleanup
              module code checks number of users
              if none, unregister all interfaces
              otherwise return -EBUSY
       if return wasn't -EBUSY, free all resources

You haven't given a coherent argument re why it gets harder when there
are multiple ways of adding a user.  Conceptually, each user incs
mod->count; we don't care how many they are, or what kind they are or
when they do it.  All we care about is that they inc the count under
the appropriate lock.

What is the complex and inflexible part?

That's not correct.  It's currently called on every mount.

I don't see that this makes any difference at all.

I'm proposing to add a return code to mod->cleanup (and pick a better
name).  Yes, every module will have to be fixed to use this interface, but
why not?  The current interface is broken, and besides, changing the module
interface every year or so helps nVidia remember why they should be good
and document their hardware, so we can maintain their driver for them.
Since we are changing the interface whichever way it goes, we should favor
the simplest interface.
Anyway, you're proposing to do it backwards.  We need to first ensure
there are no users, then unregister the interfaces.
