 Was DEC Alpha an Open Source project? ;-)
 Memory barriers are more RISC-styled and more flexible anyway (e.g. you
can't run out of them ;-) ), though they require a greater care when
writing code.  MTRRs are the Intel style of complicating designs.  Still
they are probably a reasonable solution to preserve DOS compatibility.
