But BeOS is not Linux and Linux is not BeOS.  MacOS (or whatever Mac
users call their OS) is not Linux either, and Linux is not MacOS.  I'm
not saying that BeOS does not have some great ideas or that it's not a
damn good system overall.  Same goes for MacOS - I haven't used that
either but I'm sure it has some sound concepts.  I'm also not saying
that we shouldn't take good ideas from other OS's and use them in
Linux.
That's what I'm not saying.  I don't think I know what I am saying at
this point, other than BeOS is not MacOS is not Linux.
