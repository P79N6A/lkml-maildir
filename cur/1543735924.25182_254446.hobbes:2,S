Hello,
I have some problems with my kernel 2.6.7 and 2.6.8.1.
I get this message « mount_devfs_fs(): unable to mount devfs, err: -5 » 
and then « unable to open an initial console » What's this ? What does 
« err: -5 » mean ?
I tried with no devfs compiled in but i still have this error message 
« unable to open an initial console »
Fortunatly, i had kept my old kernel ( 2.4.20 ) who have no devfs 
compiled in and it run very well for 7 months ;-)
What's wrong with my system ?? Did i forget an option in the compilation ?
I have looked everywhere about that problem until monday !
Thanks a lot to someone who can help me ;)
Hey ! Sorry for my poor english but i'm a native french speaker ;)
