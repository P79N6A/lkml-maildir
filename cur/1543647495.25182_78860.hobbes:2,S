Greetings,
On behalf of the EVMS team, I would like to submit the Enterprise Volume 
Management System for review and possible inclusion in the 2.5 kernel.
This submission includes only the core driver and include files. Additional 
plugins will be submitted in the future in separate patches.
This series of patches contains the following files:
1) evms.c
2) services.c
3) discover.c
4) passthru.c
5) evms_core.h
6) evms.h
7) evms_ioctl.h
8) evms_biosplit.h
9) miscellaneous files
If you are interested in other information about EVMS, or would
like to obtain the user-space administration tools, please visit
our website at 
http://evms.sourceforge.net/.
Thank you very much for taking the time to review this submission. If you 
have any questions or comments, please email us at any time. We will be happy 
to do whatever is necessary to make EVMS acceptable for inclusion in the 2.5 
tree.
