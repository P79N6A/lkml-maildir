Your example is very CPU-independent, i.e., not x86_64-specific,
so following examples of recently-added syscalls should be good enough.
I used your "patch" below (with a few small modifications) on
2.6.22-rc2 and it worked fine.

syscall_max is no longer used.

not unsigned.

eh?  does not compile.

I just used the syscall() glibc interface instead of asm:
	ret = syscall(__NR_newcall);

Mostly typos...

Sounds mostly OK to me.
Where are the ring head, tail, size, etc. maintained?
