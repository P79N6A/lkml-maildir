	Yes.  That still doesn't change the fact that in 2.4 I need the
headers.  In 2.5 I need all 200MB of source + 60MB per different .config
of built tree.  And that's per user using that source.

	You'd obviously have to have a way in the readonly /usr/src bits
to make sure that autoconf.h and the checksums match.  That would have
to be enforced (as Red Hat does now with their method).

	Maybe a way to track the differnet builds.  I'm not sure.  But
say you had a way of keeping multiple autoconf.h files in a tree.  If
the kernel sources could be smart enough to figure out the version.h and
modversions locations from that path, then you could have an external
module create a kbuild makefile for itself and run something like:
make KERN_CONF=/usr/src/linux-2.6.1/include/autoconf/build-smp/autoconf.h modules
where kbuild figures out from KERN_CONF that modversions stuff is in
autoconf/buid-smp/modversions/ and version.h is in
autoconf/build-smp/version.h, etc.  Something like that (I can beef with
this example, so no one tell me exactly why this specific example is bad
:-)

	Yes, I understand that there are priorities.
