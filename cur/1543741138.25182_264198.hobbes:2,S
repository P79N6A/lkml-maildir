Oh it still does, but those cores tend to get farmed out for PSU
controll or some specific subsystem unless you're "deeply embedded".

I dunno. It might. I think the trouble is that you'll need to convince
people who think they want single core designs that it's not a must.
Although within a little time it'll increasingly be the case that one
has additional cores whether one wants them or not, that's not just yet
even now. Someone will doubtlessly disagree.

Nah. The guys I work with have enough trouble making things time nicely
with precisely coded sequences accounting for every available T state.

Some of the folks I work with think not. I'm not sure yet - many people
seem to be of the opinion that it's not worth it, but we're told that
the Smartphone guys and others without throwaway cores (or to simplify a
design somewhat) really want this. Incidentally, it looks like they'll
be about a bazzion cores in this particular FPGA range before long, so
it'll become increasingly fun finding things for them to do.

I guess it would. But then we've just had a slew of RT implementations
crawl out of the woodwork and wave at us over the past few weeks and
there are three other major RT implementations which combine Linux with
a Microkernel or other external support (RTLinux, RTAI, KURT, etc.).
Perhaps it's worth working on one of the Linux patch projects
(Monta/Ingo/etc.) rather than going all out to implement it all again.
Jon.
