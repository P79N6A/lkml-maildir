Hi,
could anyone give me a hint about booting a 2.5.69
kernel? (Please reply directly, I'm not on the list)
When booting the 2.5.69 the boot code prints 
"Uncompressing..." and "booting..." and then 
it remains completely silent. Since the hard disk
gets active, the kernel does not seem to have crashed,
but to have become speechless. (Standard x86 hardware)
Any idea?
regards
Hadmut
