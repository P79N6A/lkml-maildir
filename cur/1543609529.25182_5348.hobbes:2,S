Dude.  Really.  Have you actually read CodingStyle?  No joke, I hear
complaints about your code formatting from several [non-viro :):)]
sources.
The practice of non-standard indentation and non-standard "if"
formatting -really- makes the code hard to read.
Is there a good reason why your code is vehemently different from
CodingStyle?
