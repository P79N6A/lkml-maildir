Ah this could be the same case.  I just looked into the definition of
the conditional variable pthread stuff and it looks like it _could_ be
implemented using pipes but I do not see why it would per se.  If it
does not use pipes, then this sync issue is not at hand (only the pipe
code passed 1 for the sync flag).
If it does not use pipes, we could have another problem - but I doubt
it.  Maybe the benchmark is just another case where it shows worse
performance due to some attribute of the scheduler or load balancer?
