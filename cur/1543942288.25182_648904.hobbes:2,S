Subject: [PATCH 3/3] KGDB: Update documentation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/5/514

Align KGDB's DocBook chapters with all previous changes. To avoid
confusion, it removes references to the not-yet-merged KGDBOE driver.
