	You are confused. I'm talking here of the wavelan_cs driver
for the old (obsolete) Wavelan hardware (non IEEE). Please check the
Wireless Howto for more details.
	For the Wavelan IEEE/Orinoco, the kernel is up-to-date (the
next 2.4.18 should be once Marcelo adds the missing files), and it's
the Pcmcia package that need a backport. For PCI support, the
situation is messy, but we can talk about that off list (or check the
samba archive).
	Regards,
	Jean
