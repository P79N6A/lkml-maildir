From what I read in the spec, configuration writes are not ever posted.
They are a completely separate transaction type from memory writes, and
only memory writes are posted.  So there's no need to read-flush these.

Migrating IRQs happens in the fast path, but infrequently (every 10 
seconds or so).  However the mask function is called at EVERY interrupt,
so this change would be VERY expensive.
If the driver really needs to disable the interrupt, then it can call
irq_disable().  Otherwise, mask (as-is) should be fine -- it masks
the interrupt at the APIC, and the device's interrupt moderation
should take care of keeping it from generating interrupts right away.
