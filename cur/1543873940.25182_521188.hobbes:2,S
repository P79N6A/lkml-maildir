I can't get myself to expect that no matter how hard I try. The scheduler
is, by design, fair to *tasks*. So why would one expect two different
approaches that do the same thing, but with different numbers of tasks, to
each get the same amount of CPU if they compete with each other? One would
expect the approach that uses the most tasks to get more CPU.
