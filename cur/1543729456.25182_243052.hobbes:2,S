I'm not entirely concinced we need anything more than a scalar.
I think we could simply create PM_RUNTIME_0 .. PM_RUNTIME_9, and that will work
as long as all devices have <= 10 power managment states.
That can well mean "forever".
Besides, when enums are in place, you can just searcg&replace.
Search part is way harder with u32s.
