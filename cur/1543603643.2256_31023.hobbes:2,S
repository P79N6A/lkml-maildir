Not that I know of; the other cards just don't seem to scale as well.
There are a number of comparative reviews to be found on the web.  See,
for example:

What a shame.
I have it on some authority that 3ware doesn't want to sell controllers
any more because they want to move upmarket into the storage arena
where there are better margins, and they don't want to compete against
other integrators using their hardware.
I really like my 7800.  At this point I guess I'm going to convert from
hard to soft RAID, on the theory that (unfixed) bugs in the firmware are less
likely to botch JBOD.
