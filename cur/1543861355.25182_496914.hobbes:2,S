(did anyone ever answer this?)
In IO-APIC mode, /proc/interrupts contains entries like these:
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:  121218123          0    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:     715259          0    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  6:          5          0    IO-APIC-edge  floppy
  7:          0          0    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
  9:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 12:   10011272          0    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
 14:   11561548          0    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 66:    4525183          0         PCI-MSI  libata

 98:     101326          0         PCI-MSI  HDA Intel
106:   17747181          0         PCI-MSI  eth0
169:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb9
177:          3          0   IO-APIC-level  ohci1394

193:     427962          0   IO-APIC-level  uhci_hcd:usb7, aic79xx
If not in IO-APIC mode, lots of those will say "XT-PIC" instead
of IO-APIC.
