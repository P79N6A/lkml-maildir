Is it supposed to? My MS-DOS file system(s) always have shown files
with their names mapped to lower case. The MS-DOS files all have
upper case file-names and always will. It's only Windows file-systems,
starting with FAT-32, then NT-FS that have upper/lower case file-names,
and container-files for "Very Long File Names with spaces and a letter to
the president"
If the file-system is identified as a MS-DOS file-system when mounted,
you will see the file names in lower case. I don't think this is a
bug because that's the way it is designed.
Regardless of how you create them, new file-names will look lower-case,
but internally, corresponding to the MS-DOS de-facto specs., the
file-names will be in upper case.
FYI MBASIC allowed DOS files to be created in lower case. You could
not delete them, except from MBASIC.
Also, your shell-script was created in DOS. Instead of the Unix/Linux
stream-LF format, you had CR/LF at each end-of-line. Not nice if
you expect to have somebody actually test something for you.
