It's not that easy unfortunately.  I did what you describe above in my
first prototype but then found out the hard way that the struct device
in the netdevice can be a non-pci one, e.g. for pcmcia.  Im that case
the kernel will crash on you becuase you can only get the node infortmation
for pci devices.  My current patchkit adds an "int node" member to struct
net_device instead.  I can repost the patchkit ontop of -mm (which is
the required slab memory leak tracking changes) if anyone cares.
