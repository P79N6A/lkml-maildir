This seems rather arbitrary.  Why choose this stage in the page
reclaimation process rather than some other stage?
If this feature is useful then I'd expect that some applications would want
notification at different times, or at different levels of VM distress.  So
this semi-randomly-chosen notification point just won't be strong enough in
real-world use.
Does this change work correctly and appropriately for processes which are
running in a cgroup memory controller?
Given the amount of code which these patches add, and the subsequent
maintenance burden, and the unlikelihood of getting many applications to
actually _use_ the interface, it is not obvious to me that inclusion in the
kernel is justifiable, sorry.
memory_pressure_notify() is far too large to be inlined.
Some of the patches were wordwrapped.
