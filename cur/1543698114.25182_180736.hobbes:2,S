OK, there is broken hardware, but there are also people with
non-broken hardware who want to make better use of it :-).  I am not
recommending that everybody moves away from the standard partition
table format, I just want a better partitioning scheme for new
machines I build, (for which I would avoid using known broken
hardware).

Hmmm, yes, you can use a BSD disk label on a whole disk, as opposed to
putting a BSD disk label on one partition of a disk.  I have never
tried to read such a disk on a Linux machine, though - do we support
that correctly?

For building new, dedicated Linux machines, though, how much of that
do we have to concern ourselves with?
