Yes it could but why should it? The purpose of udev is to maintain
dynamic /dev. Do you want to have thoustands quirks in udev to cope
with bazillion configuration files for utilities whose authors refuse
to adopt standard naming convention [for the operating system in
question].
I do not understand why Joerg is so fixed on presenting SCSI interface
to userspace. Why when I mount just burned CD I can use /dev/scd0 but
for writing it I should say dev=5,4,0?? I do not really care that
internally X,Y,Z might or might not used, they should not be exposed
to userspace, especially since days when they could be used for static
device identification are long gone.
