Hi it's really great  feature,
i'm useing the 2.4 backport 
(sadly without the framebuffer drivers)
it works without problems.
if it's included in 2.6 
one could use one  PC for 2,3 or more users at the same time
in case the framebuffer drivers work
( the case with 2.5 , 2.6) 
one could use 2 double headed cards on 1 PC for 4 users
i think this very important feature let say for univercities, libraries, internet cafes ........
it cost so much less per user
