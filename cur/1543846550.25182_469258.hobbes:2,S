If auto_brightness is 2 we assume that the user doesn't want the
module to fiddle with the automatic brightness control
automatically. So we don't do it, neither when loading nor when
unloading the module. However, if the user wants to fiddle with the
setting through sysfs he may do so and we will not reset his changes
when unloading the module. This allows the user to do something like
this to disable the brightness control without having the the driver
loaded the whole time:
  modprobe msi-laptop auto_brightness=2 && echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/msi-laptop-pf/auto_brightness && modprobe -r msi-laptop
If auto_brightness is 1 or 0, we do as requested but reset the control
to the bootup default when unloading. (i.e. enable it again)
Sounds like a reasonable policy to me, doesn't it to you?

Hmm, I am sorry? I don't understand what you mean? 
There's only a single device of this type available in a system at
maximum. Hence "per-device" and "per-module" is mostly the same here.
