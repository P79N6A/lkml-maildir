Maybe talking through the top of my hat , however -
copy_from_user and copy_to_user are used all over the place and the
return tested to see if an EFAULT should be generated.
Looking at include/asm-i386/uaccess.h and arch/i386/lib/usercopy.c
I don't see how these return anything but the 3rd (length) param.
