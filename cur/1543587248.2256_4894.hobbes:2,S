Hi,
  so, now I used RH 6.2 with 2.4.3 kernel on my notebook. X is something
from CVS, don't know what exactly now, but I think it's something about
4.0.2-3, don't know, attaching XF86Config and sis_drv.o for you. So, you must
enable VESA frame buffer support in kernel
  Console drivers  --->
    [*] VGA text console
    [*] Video mode selection support
    ...
    Frame-buffer support  --->
      [*] Support for frame buffer devices (EXPERIMENTAL)
      ...
      [*]   VESA VGA graphics console
      ...
      [*]   Advanced low level driver options
      <*>     Monochrome support
      <*>     2 bpp packed pixels support
      <*>     4 bpp packed pixels support
      <*>     8 bpp packed pixels support
      <*>     16 bpp packed pixels support
      <*>     24 bpp packed pixels support
      <*>     32 bpp packed pixels support
      ...
      <*>     VGA characters/attributes support
  Now, you must configure lilo in /etc/lilo.conf, for instance I've got:
  image=/boot/bzImage-2.4.3-fb
          label=2.4.3-fb
          read-only
          vga=791
          root=/dev/hda3
  vga=791 is resolution and bpp for frame buffer. Other resolutions you
can find in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt. (there are hex
numbers in this file and I'm using decimal in lilo.conf). Now, you
can safely reboot your computer and you will have frame buffer support
and properly set LCD display.
  Now, you can use accelerated Xserver from XFree86 3.3.6, or XSiS_SVGA
(you can find it on www.sis.com.tw pages). It will work, but when you want
switching from console to X and back, you will fail. If you want switching
you must upgrade to 4.x release and use driver from attachment
(/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers) - I attach my XF86Config for X 4.x too.
This driver sends me Rene Rebe <rene.rebe -- gmx.net>. I try to contact
SiS driver developers on internal development list, but no success, I try
to contact directly SiS, no answer too ;( So, if you want X, the best
solution is use X 4.x release with attached driver.
  Are there some one who is responsible for SiS support in kernel? This
support doesn't work too as in X ;((
  R.obot.V
P.S. Remember - frame buffer resolution (may bpp too) must be the same
as X resolution or you will fail again.
