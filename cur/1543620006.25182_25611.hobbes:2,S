	Oh, but async + O_DIRECT is a good thing.  The fundamental
ordering comes down at the block layer.  Things are synchronous there.
An application using async I/O knows that ordering is not guaranteed.
Applications using O_DIRECT know they are skipping the buffer cache.
"Caveat emptor" and "Don't do that then" apply to stupid applications.
	The big issues I see are O_DIRECT alignment size (see my patch
to allow hardsectsize alignment on O_DIRECT ops) and whether or not to
synchronize with the caches upon O_DIRECT write.  Keeping the
page/buffer caches in sync with O_DIRECT writes is a bit of work,
especially with writes smaller than sb_blocksize.  You can either do
that work, or you can say that applications and people using O_DIRECT
should know the caches might be inconsistent.  Large O_DIRECT users,
such as databases, already know this.  They are happily ignorant of
cache inconsistencies.  All they care about is hardsectsize O_DIRECT
operations.
