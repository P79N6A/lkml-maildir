NO! async is a stupidity that was introduced in order to get round the
fact that NFSv2 had no server-side equivalent of the "fsync()" command.
Async breaks O_SYNC writes, fsync(), sync(), ... Most importantly, it
removes all the normal guarantees that clients can recover safely if the
server reboots or crashes.
<RANT>I find it hard to understand how people, who would normally scream
if you told them that "fsync()" on their desktop PC was broken and
didn't actually flush data to disk, can find it quite acceptable as long
as it's "only" their central storage units that are broken in the same
way.</RANT>
In any case, the performance benefit of using "async" should be very
small these days.

Not necessarily. Consider the case of a random workload in which you
touch the same page more than once. Why then flush those same pages out
to disk more than once?
