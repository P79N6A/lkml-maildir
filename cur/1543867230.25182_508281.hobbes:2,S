No. Especially for things like localversion, the object tree (if it is 
different) is very much where you'd put that marker.
You might have several object trees for the same source tree, with 
different configurations. Exactly to remember which one is which, you'd 
have a "localversion" file in each object tree.

It's the regexp in both cases. $(wildcard ) doesn't do regexp's (only the 
normal path rules), and traditional 'find' doesn't either. The fact that 
GNU find does is another matter. I don't think we require GNU find 
normally.
And I don't even much like the "backup" thing. Some programs will use 
other things than "~" as a backup marker. Patch more often uses ".orig", 
for example. So both methods are fairly complex, but at the same time not 
quite complex enough.
It would probably have been a better idea had we made the rule be that the 
file is called "*localversion" rather than "localversion*", exactly 
because that way it's unambiguous (people normally use _suffixes_ for 
filetypes, not prefixes). That would have avoided the whole complexity in 
wildcarding, but it's too late now..
	$(sort $(wildcard $(srctree)/*localversion $(objtree)/*localversion)
should have worked.
