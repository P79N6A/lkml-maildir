Thanks Ingo! 
I've pulled the THREAD_ORDER change from my next version of the patch.
Seems SMP_MAX is just not ready for prime time yet.
One problem that I'm having appears to be that the !NUMA config of the
current -mm version also doesn't boot so I haven't been able to verify
that.  (At least it doesn't seem to make it worse... ;-)
Thanks,
Mike
