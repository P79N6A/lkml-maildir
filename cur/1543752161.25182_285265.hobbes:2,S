You're 100% right! It was not the purpose to solve it in the first
place, but rather
to remove the ranking algorithm out of kernel. 
Hmmm, it seems you removed the selection problem from your original list,
that means we made our point. Thankyou!

No, I certainly don't. But, have seen the application we also posted? It is
a test for while, that actually starts a deamon when you boot the kernel
and does rate this application, i.e. an application with root rating priority
so it will never be killed and never lack space for itself. 
So, the answer to your 2nd very good point.
But as I wrote above it is an idea to be tested not to impose any
change in every
root fs.

Well from the discussion below and your reasonable argument it is clear that
we are thinking of it for embeded deveices, in the first place.

Yes, you're 100% right again. Sorry but, Does this mean that for everything it 
manages the kernel should compute rates for PID? It seems that only tests
can show which way is more appropriate. Perhaps it may end up showing
that both ways reach the same result, but, perhaps, with different algorithm 
ingenuity. We shall work on this test data and it soon. Thank you.

I didn't mean you don't know. Don't it personal.

Back to your list of problems, we tackled just one. The selection problem. For
sure we will investigate on your solution and see a faster way to enhance ours 
with with your approach. Who knows the other way around might work as well?
Thank you again
