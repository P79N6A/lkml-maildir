Yes sure, we leak the re-parented zombies, and nobody can take care of
/etc/inittab. As expected.
But otherwise the system runs fine.

But panic() isn't better? It doesn't provide any useful info.

Well, I think the generic "if we have a chance to survive, we should try
to survive" rule is good.
If the boot init dies, at least the admin has a chance to figure out what
has happened, and -o remount,ro /.
Every BUG/BUG_ON in fact means the system is not useable, but still it does
not panic(), but tries to proceed.
In short, I can't see why panic() is better. Except we have panic_timeout,
but we can take it into account if init exits.

OK, I won't argue (not that I agree ;).
