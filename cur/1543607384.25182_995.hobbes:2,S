Well I don't want my laptop to suspend during a CD burn or firmware update.
The device itself doesn't know anything about how busy it is since its
just sending packets, only the subsystem driver controller it does

Stopping all user apps really tends to ruin the cd and the firmware
update.

It also has to avoid unpleasant situations

There are certain practicalities here with trying to make user space dig
around in fuser innards or patching every cd burner. The sg layer is one
that has to get involved (be it as a driver call back or a virtual driver)
