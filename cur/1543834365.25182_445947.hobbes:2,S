That is because if kmem_cache_create gets called with SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN set
in flags then ralign will be greater or equal to ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN:
        /* 1) arch recommendation: can be overridden for debug */ 
        if (flags & SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN) { 
	        [...]
                ralign = cache_line_size(); 
	        [...]
Therefore the test above will be passed and SLAB_RED_ZONE and SLAB_STORE_USER
will stay in flags.
cache_line_size() will return 256 on s390.
