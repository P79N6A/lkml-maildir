I agree that you cannot do a perfect job.  The goal is to get something
that is good enough so that it can be enabled and not give an automatic root
exploit if someone accidentally leaves it on at the wrong time.

Nice. And then on the transmit end I would still use a TTL=1 so that
routers will refuse to route the packets.  A bit asymmetric but I only
care about security in one direction.  
But in what kind of configurations is checking the ip against the
current netmask insufficient?  Checking for a TTL of 255 will
trivially make the check stronger.
Having a network console for various debugging tasks could be very
useful.  The question is how to implement it simply and reliably.
