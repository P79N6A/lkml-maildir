Im running an Dual Celeron Gigabyte 686 BXDS with linux-2.2.1-ac3.
It's running stable but on bootup the Kernel alerts about wrong
Mtrr-settings:
mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent variable MTRR settings
mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs
But the BIOS detects both CPU's. WinNT and Solaris 7 are also detecting
both CPU's.
cat /proc/mtrr:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0xe8000000 (3712MB), size=   8MB: write-combining, count=1
Is this because off the Celeron CPU's ? I couldn't test it with orig.
Pentium 2 CPU 
because I have non.
Any Idea's ???
