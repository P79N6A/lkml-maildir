If you use the Debian potato gcc272 package, you have to edit the main
kernel Makefile and change
CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
to
CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc272 -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
... or otherwise it won't work. I think it's wise to use the latest
binutils as well.

Now _that_ is something you should not have done on your Debian system-
you probably broke your compilation environment for a lot of of
other things. Remove those links, purge libc6-dev (dpkg --force-depends
--purge libc6-dev) and reinstall libc6-dev (dpkg -i libc6-dev_2.1.2-X.deb)

Hmm yes I've heard that something similar happened on a box one of
our customer uses (4xSMP, 2 GB RAM, lots-o-scsi disk). During disk
writes the machine sometimes gets unresponsive for tens of seconds.
Can't reproduce it right now - have to fix the RAM problems first..
