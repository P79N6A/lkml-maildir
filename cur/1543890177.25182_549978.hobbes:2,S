Subject: 8 words bursts for fbdev driver

Hello,
I'm working on a FPGA vga controller, with an arm cpu (at91rm9200). My FPGA is
plugged on a 16 bits data bus. I'm trying to develop the framebuffer driver,
from the epson s1d13xxxfb driver to use my controller. I have a first driver
which works well. To accelerate my controller, I would like to read and write in
my video memory (controlled by the FPGA) by 8 words bursts. Is it possible to
tell the kernel that the memory must be accessed only by 8 words bursts ??
My driver is available on 
http://xcsnake.free.fr/driver
Thanks a lot
