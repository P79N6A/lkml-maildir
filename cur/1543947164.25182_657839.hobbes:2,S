Rafael, I'd actually prefer these changes to the i915 driver.  One is to avoid 
the "green screen" problem and the other is to actually save state at 
hibernate time in case we don't do a POST coming out of S4 (probably not 
common but hey).
Jesse
Make sure hibernation works by not shutting down the video device during 
hibernation power off.  This is important because later stages of the 
hibernation cycle end up touching the video device, which may cause a hang if 
it was disabled early on.  Also make sure the restoration correctly restores 
the AR registers by flipping the ARX register into index mode before doing 
anything.
Depends on Rafael's patch which exports hibernation state to drivers.
