I really don't like to see patches get a wholesale replacement, especially
when they've been looked at by a few people and have had some testing, etc.
It's not possible to see what changed and people need to re-review stuff
they've already reviewed, etc.
So I almost always undo this mess, turn the patches back into incremental
ones, see what pops out.
This patch is actually:

	} else {

		crash_size = crashk_res.end - crashk_res.start + 1;
	}
	if (crash_size == 0)
		return;
If so, the use of uninitialized_var() would be better than the unneeded
initialization-to-zero.
