`Will not build' is quite different from `builds but will not load'.  Please 
make sure you describe the problem accurately, otherwise people might waste 
time chasing a bug that doesn't exist.
I can't reproduce this on my system in any case.  Can you post your .config 
file and the exact errors you get?
