I'd say that's the case.  It's _possible_ that Riley's k/b has a 1000 uF
electro in there which is holding its brains across the switchover.

Russell King says he has a patch which does autorepeat in s/w.  This is
most definitely the best way.  I did this in an OS many years ago - took
one look at the XT keyboard specs and said "nope".
It's very easy to do.  Just a little state machine which squirts out the
most recent 'make' code and stops doing that when it sees a 'break'.  It
also gives you infinite control over the autorepeat speed, although
topping out at HZ seems reasonable.
I'd suggest that you grab that patch from Russell and run with it.
