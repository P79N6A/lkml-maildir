Subject: [PATCH] Ramdisk module size parameter

Bugging around with the ramdisk i've found that it wouldn't take the
size as a parameter, so you would always get 4096k ramdisks or have to
modify rd.c to change that.
This patch is against kernel 2.2.3, and is pretty simple: someone forgot
to export the rd_size parameter as a module. If it was done on purpose
just tell (or flame) me.
