Subject: chown problem on filesystems with quotas

Hello.
So, I have a big problem. Versions affected are AT LEAST 2.2.12 and
2.2.13ac1.
Problem: on filesystems with quotas chown(2) sometimes (or always ?) works
BAD.
Ok, I had no time to explore the whole thing but here is my problem:
My server crashed every night (very high load, no chance to login or
reboot). I noticed that
cron job that does updatedb was the reason.
chown root.root /var/lib/locatedb hanged and all processes became S and
chown became D. Seems that kernel was locked.
ltrace shows that /bin/chown hangs on chown(2).
Quotas on /var were turned on. When I turned quotas on /var off, chown
worked Ok.
So it seems to be a bug...
Could you please reply me directly because I'm not subscripbed to
linux-kernel list.
Thank you.
