Hey,
Okay, it's about time we stop overloading linux-kernel with this stuff.
I'm still working on my patch, we're still thinking about how to do this,
and all that.  I think Larry and I agree that there's no point in swamping
linux-kernel any longer... anyone who's actually interested, talk to one
or the other of us, and I'll post my patch when I get it done (assuming
this thread dies down so that I actually have time to finish it :)
My sincere apologies go out to everyone who just doesn't care and has
spent the last few days wishing we'd just go away.
