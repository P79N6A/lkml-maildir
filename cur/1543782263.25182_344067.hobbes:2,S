Oh!.. unless the epoll_data_t is a union just for convenience in that it 
already has an 'int fd' if you want to use that, but don't have to.. 
that at least makes the void *ptr, useful..  The example in 'man epoll' 
sorta made it look necessary to set the 'fd' of the union.
But that still doesn't fix the issue of course.. but good to know.
