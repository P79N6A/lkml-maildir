Subject: [PATCH] Fix forcedeth reversing the MAC address on suspend
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/4/267

For cards that initially have the MAC address stored in reverse order,
the forcedeth driver uses a flag to signal whether the address was
already corrected, so that it is not reversed again on a subsequent
probe.
Unfortunately this flag, which is stored in a register of the card,
seems to get lost during suspend, resulting in the MAC address being
reversed again. To fix that, the MAC address needs to be written back in
reversed order before we suspend and the flag needs to be reset.
The flag is still required because at least kexec will never write back
the reversed address and thus needs to know what state the card is in.

Thanks.
Ayaz, you originally wrote the kexec fix (IIRC), was my analysis of the
problem correct? If so, I'm quite sure that the patch DTRT. Still it
should be tested for the rmmod+modprobe and the kexec case. I'll try to
get my box free for some testing, but that's unlikely in the next few
days. Plus, I've never used kexec myself either. So I'd be grateful if
someone else would step up.
