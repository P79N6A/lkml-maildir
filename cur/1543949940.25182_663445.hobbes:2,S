But we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater; assuming there are 
lots of machines out there with good data (I really hope that's the case), 
this feature seems like a really good idea.

Yeah, I think a good fallback is important.  Might be good to have a blacklist 
along with a heuristic for detecting duplicate slot names...  Anyway, yeah, 
testing will be huge here.
