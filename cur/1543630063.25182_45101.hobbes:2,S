This is fixed in recent kernels, you can specify it with a CONFIG
option:
# uname -a

Of course on ppc64 kernels you have a full 4GB of userspace since
the kernel sits at the top of the 64bit address space.

Paulus also has a hack that allows up to 15G of memory on POWER3 class
machines although that isnt currently in the ppc32 tree.

This is all very well and good, put my ppc64 machine still outperforms
anything out there on the kernel compile benchmark :)
