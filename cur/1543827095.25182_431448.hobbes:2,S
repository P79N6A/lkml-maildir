The JBD API is reasonably distinct, so IMO this would be a logical next 
step.  I would hope they could use the same JBD, so, I strongly agree...

I disagree completely...  it would be an obvious win:  people who want 
stability get that, people who want new features get that too.

reiser4 actually has this same problem, but worse.  It has pluggable 
metadata even to the point of supporting plugin-style metadata development.
If we can successfully devolve a filesystem to metadata and algorithm 
plugins, that should be done at the VFS level, and not called "reiser4".
But in the absence of a different VFS API, I think it is the most 
practical of all the options to open the floodgates to ext4 rather than 
ext3.
