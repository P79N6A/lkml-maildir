Yeah I knew there was one, but I thought that was a standalone patch
(the one turning all bufctl to unsigned long, turning off irqs and
printing all slabs_full to console), my intention with this was a
proper /proc entry, something that could be a simple config option.
But if something like this already exists, would you please send me what
you have and I'll fix the numa changes
