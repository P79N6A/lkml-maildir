  I want to thank everyone for helping me get my Solaris driver 
  running under Linux.
  It's taken three days, but it appears to be working, it passes all
  my hardware diagnostics and I'm ready to hook it up to the
  application layer. I think going from knowing NOTHING about the
  Linux kernel to a working PCI bus driver in three days is not too 
  shabby.
  The Rubini and Corbet book helped a LOT, but it helped more after
  I knew what I was doing a bit.
  I suspect I'll be back when I start implementing the DMA part.
  Hey! what RPM do I install so I can get man pages for kernel
  functions? A man page for readl() sure would have been useful.
  Thanks a million folks!!!
