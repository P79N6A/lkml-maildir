It's not unlikely that the drives that IBM shipped in that notebook used
a "secret" command or subfeature to park the head. It's a little strange
though, as they supposedly shipped various makes and models of drives
with the hdaps included. If they did use a vendor unique command for
parking the head, I bet it would be different for each make.
