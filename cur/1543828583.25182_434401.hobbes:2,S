Should be in the morning.  The patches are ready I just need to make certain
I copy all of the appropriate people, add signed-off-by lines, etc.
The reason for the delay was that I didn't have a convenient base.  I
had a development effort that as it's final product turned up a bug.
I think everything is in good shape but I don't trust myself until I slept
on it all.
My patches are incremental against 2.6.17-rc6-mm2 as that turned out
to be the easiest place to start.
