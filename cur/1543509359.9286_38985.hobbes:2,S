Try my new input drivers, at 
http://www.suse.cz/development/input,
 those will
automatically restore the repeat rate (and leds) when you plug (switch) the
keyboard back in.
Or, alternately, open the switch box, and solder the power anf ground line
to just one of the inputs, this way the keyboard won't reset its settings
when you switch between the servers.
