Maybe the PPC keyboard/mouse drivers do not add randomness?  You should
also get randomness from disk I/O.  If your PPC system is diskless,
mouseless, and keyboardless, there is also a patch for 2.4 which allows
you to get randomness from network card interrupts, which is good enough
for all but the most incredibly paranoid people.
Cheers, Andreas
