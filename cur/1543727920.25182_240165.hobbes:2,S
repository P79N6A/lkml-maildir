Uh, not really. During suspend-to-disk, you would call
	device_stop();
	device_save();
	<snapshot system>
	class_device_start(suspend_device);
	<write snapshot>
	class_device_stop(suspend_device);
	device_power_down(state);

AFAICT, no.

To be more precise, "device is not processing any transactions and will
not be used to submit more to". It's up to the class to remove it from any
queues, etc, so DMA never has a chance to begin.

That's not the point, at least at this stage. Eventually, the u32 could be
replaced with an enum. But, remember why there is confusion - the value of
the system suspend level was also passed to the drivers as the device
suspend level. If you read the email again and look at the code, you will
see that drivers always get passed a 'struct pm_state', and the 'u32' are
only used between the suspend imeplementations and the driver core (which
is the re-mapper). I think compile-time checks are good, but we're in
bigger trouble if we can't get a half-dozen calls using the right value..

It's not too complex; it's simply that the driver core is the one
responsible between mapping a system suspend state to the device suspend
state, based on values that the driver knows a priori. If you push that
responsibility down to the drivers, you require all of them to implement
the same thing, causing code duplication, which means more copy-n-pasting,
and more of a chance to get it wrong. If we choose to do it once and right
in the driver core, the resulting drivers become simpler, since they only
have to respond to something that says "enter this power state, damnit"
On the other hand, if it's too complicated for you, I encourage you to
modify the patch or create a new one that solves all of the problems in a
simpler manner.

There is nothing fundamentally different at the functional level - you
don't want any devices fulfilling any request. Besides, by the time the
system is actually ready to be placed in S4, the devices have long-since
been stopped, and the class devices do not need another notification
beyond "stop"
