I'm not scanning /sys/devices, I'm scanning /sys/block and /sys/class which 
this document implies are deprecated and going away.  I'm trying to figure 
out what replaced them.  Now instead of following a path to naturally get 
char devices in one pass and block devices in another, it seems I have to 
readlink a symlink and do string manipulation to identify the device type 
once I've found the device.
I can do this, I'd just like to confirm it's "the way" now, and by "the way" I 
mean Greg won't change his mind and yank it next month.

Ok, hang on, looking back on this I'm confused again.
When you say /sys/subsystem are you referring to a literal path (which my sys 
directory currently doesn't have a subdirectory named "subsystem"), or do you 
mean /sys/$SUBSYSTEM where today I have /sys/class and /sys/block?

I have yet to encounter any, could you give me some examples?
find /sys/bus -name dev
Nope, nothing...
Would these device nodes be char devices, or block devices, or... something 
else entirely?  (The practical distinction between /sys/class and /sys/block 
used to be that one contained char devices and the other block devices.  I 
could work with that.  I'm sad to see it going away...)

Whether you feed "b" or "c" to mknod is a kernel implementation detail?
Are you unifying char and block devices so mknod doesn't have to distinguish 
between them anymore?

What I've had to do each time was install a new kernel, find out what had 
changed by examination, and update programs to work with the new stuff.
I'd like to be able to do it from documentation.
