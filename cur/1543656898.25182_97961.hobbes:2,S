I've done some more tests:
The problem still occurs with straight ide drivers, no ide-scsi
The problem still occurs with 2.4.20-ac2
I removed extraneous llseek syscalls from libdvdread, it's now reading purely
sequentially and still failing. I doubt an llseek to the current location even
gets through to the driver but I figured I would remove another variable.
Question: Does the readahead parameter in hdparm affect accesses to the raw
/dev/hdd device? Does it affect atapi cdrom access?
