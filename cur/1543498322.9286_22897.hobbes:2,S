Then here is a patch.  It is against 2.2.10pre2, but I suspect it will
apply to other versions.  I make no claim for its elegance, etc, but it
works for me.  If anyone thinks of a better one, that would be nice.
The other arches should probably adopt similar changes.  I don't know
enough about anything but Intel to do it.
