No, not necessarily - think of a stripe with a chunk size of 512k.
That 4MB will be split into 8x512k chunks and sent to different
devices (and hence elevator queues). The only way you get elevator
merging in this sort of config is that if you send multiple stripe
*width* sized amounts to the device in a very short time period.
I see quite a few filesystems with stripe widths in the tens of MB
range.....

Agreed.
The comments I've made are mainly concerned with getting efficient
flushing of a single device occuring. Interactions between multiple
devices are a separable issue....
Cheers,
