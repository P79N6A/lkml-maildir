Interesting.
I was afraid that somebody would actually be _using_ the SA_RESTORER thing 
for some totally private version of signal handler return, but I was 
hoping that wouldn't be the case.
SA_RESTORER was always a bit broken.. The functionality can trivially be
restored (suggested untested patch appended), since it makes it very hard
to improve on signal handling, since old binaries that use SA_RESTORER
will force our hand.
Oh, well. Can you verify whether this fixes it for you? And thanks for 
hunting down the exact changeset.
Btw, what version of "init" are you running? It would be interesting to 
see what it actually does, and obviously none of the machines I have 
around have that init..
