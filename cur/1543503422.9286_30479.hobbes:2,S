Subject: Any work on HSM on Linux ?

Is there at this time any work on HSM for Linux in this area, be
it commercial or non commercial / open source or closed source ?
Are there maybe already software solutions for this ?
That would for example include a new filesystem transparently migrating
and unmigrating a filesystem to slower storage (e.g. MO discs,
remote file server, tape changers).
To my knowledge, this doesn't exist yet.
I would be grateful if you have any pointers (send them by mail to me
so not to overload linux-kernel), and I will do a summary.
If a mailing-list specifically targetted on this exists also,
that would interest me. If not, I might create one.
