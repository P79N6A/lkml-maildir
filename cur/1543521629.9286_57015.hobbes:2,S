The message says
  WARNING: This version of ksymoops is obsolete.
  WARNING: The current version can be obtained from 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops
The 2.2 kernel scripts/ksymoops code works but is out of date, that is,
it is obsolete.  Where is the confusion?

It does say this, in /pub/ksymoops/v2.3/README.
patch-sysklogd-1-3-31-ksymoops-1.gz
                                A patch against sysklogd 1-3-31 to preserve
                                information that ksymoops needs to do its job.
                                This patch has been accepted by the sysklogd
                                maintainer and should appear in the next release
                                of sysklogd.
I am not responsible for sysklogd, the best I can do is publish a patch
that I believe is required and hope that people read the README file.
