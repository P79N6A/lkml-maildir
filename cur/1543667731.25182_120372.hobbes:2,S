So would I!  but I'm afraid I've done this the pte_chainp way too.
rmap_get_cpu() becomes attractive when you know that you nowhere
need more than one per cpu per locking, as in anobjrmap where
copy_page_range needs none at all; but I don't see much point in
trying to backport it to mainline/-mm without that assurance.
