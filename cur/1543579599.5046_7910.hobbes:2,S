Hi, 
I have a 2.2.5-15 kernel linux system (red Hat 6.0) that is installed on /dev/hdc2. I boot it from a floppy.
Recently, I did compile my new kernel 2.4 on my Linux System.
On the boot floppy, I have LILO (On the hard drive, there's also LILO). 
For booting my new kernel (/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0), I added following stanza to /etc/lilo.conf (the one on the hard drive): 
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0
label=linux2.4
root=/dev/hdc2
read-only. 
Lilo was correctly saved (/sbin/lilo..or lilo would display "Added linux2.2 *
Added linux2.4, Added dos). 
But when I rebooted the system
with the boot floppy, LILO wont display linux2.4 so that I can boot with it!
LILO would only show up the old linux. 
I went adding the same stanza (as previously mentionned) to /etc/lilo.conf
that is on the floppy. But the problem is still the same: I do not have the choice to boot with linux2.4!
I tried "lilo -b /dev/fd0" (after /dev/fd0 
have been correctly mounted), but system 
weirdly complained that "open /boot/message: No such file or directory" (which is wrong!).
I got same error message when trying "lilo -C /mnt/floppy/etc/lilo.conf"! 
******Here is my /etc/lilo.conf on hard drive*********
