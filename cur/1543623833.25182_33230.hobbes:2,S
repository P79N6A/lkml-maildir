Marcelo, any chance of getting this accepted into the next 2.4.19-pre? 
It is obviously a bug that is afecting several others as well.  I think
the LSE team is looking at some performance enhancements to get_pid, but
from what I've seen so far they will be working on top of this bug fix. 
I just verified that the patch still applies cleanly against
2.4.19-pre2.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
