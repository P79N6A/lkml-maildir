Subject: Quick vger downtime tomorrow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/2/14/166

The physical machine running these lists will be moved
to a different location around 21:30 GMT.  The outage will
last (as noticable to list subscribers) anywhere from 1
to 3 hours long.
So please refrain from "Why is vger not responding to SMTP
connections and why am I not receiving postings?" queries.
Ok?  :-)
