Hi, Martin is doing a great job, thanks.
I have read about its doc.  It should be suitable for various
readahead numbers. And it seems a trivial work to port to it :)
However it might also make sense to keep the current _table_ interface.
It shows us the whole picture at a glance:

When Martin's work is included into -mm, I would like to reduce
several col/rows from the table to Martin's infrastructure, and
perhaps add some more items. One obvious candidate collection is the
ra_account(NULL, ...) calls, which do not quite fit the table
interface and deserves individual files.
