Ok, now I know how to go back in the normal state of kernel operation. I 
just have to do "ifconfig eth0 down" and ksoftirqd stop taking all the 
cpu-time, after that I can do "ifconfig eth0 up" and everything is working 
fine.
So I guess it is 8139too-driver which has a bug.
First "SysRq : Show Regs" when the kernel is ok:

Second "SysRq : Show Regs" when the ksoftirqd has started to take all the 
cpu-time:

Third one after I have done ifconfig eth0 down/up.

I also compiled 8139too-driver with debub-options on and the logfile is 
included as attachment. 
Everything is going ok until end of the 20:41:29, then it happens:

The hardest part is to tell where the problem is but I think that 
rtl8139_poll-function would be good place to start looking for the bug?
readprofile didn't tell much.. Where to go next? I'm not so good 
programmer that I could find the right place to fix..
