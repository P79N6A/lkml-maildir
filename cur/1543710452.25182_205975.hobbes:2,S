I have noticed that 2.6 seems to clear memory (any version I've run for 
a while) and a lunch break results in a burst of disk activity before 
the screen saver even gets in to unlock the screen. I know this box has 
no cron activity during the day, so the pages were not forced out.
It's a good thing IMHO to write dirty pages to swap so the space can be 
reclaimed if needed, but shouldn't the page be marked as clean and left 
in memory for use without swap-in nif it's needed? I see this on backup 
servers, and a machine with 3GB of free memory, no mail, no cron and no 
app running isn't getting much memory pressure ;-)
I am not saying the behaviour is wrong, I just fail to see why the last 
application run isn't still in memory an hour later, absent memory pressure.
