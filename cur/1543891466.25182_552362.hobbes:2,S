As Peter suggested earlier, the best strategy would be to
cleanup the code and make it stack-light in the first place ...

There are standard mechanisms to push off long duration or
sleep-capable work from interrupts-disabled contexts to user
contexts. But those contexts can also, obviously, be interrupted,
so if you're stack-heavy and suffer a concurrent interrupt (which
you most definitely will in any codepath this long), there's always
the possibility of stack overflowing. I don't really see a better
solution to this than using bigger stacks or reducing your usage
of the same, but of course, better suggestions would be difficult
to give without looking at the code in question.

IMHO, *not*. You could try this, in any case, and learn it the
hard way :-)
