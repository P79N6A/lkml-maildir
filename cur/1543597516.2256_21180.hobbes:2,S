Hello kernel developers
I am asking this question here because of a lack of results with
my post to the linux-parport list. I hope you don't mind.
I have an Intek21 PCI parallel port (PCI vendor id=14DB,
device id=2120) which is advertised as supporting interrupt
sharing. I am writing a custom driver for this card in place
of a previously working custom driver for an ISA parallel port.
The problem is I can not get hardware interrupts to work.
The /proc/pci file reports that the card is using IRQ 11
as does the pci_dev struct. Also pci_read_config_byte tells me
that INTA is being used for this card. I enable interrupts
as with the former ISA device but I get no interrupts (my
ISR is never called upon level triggering pin 10).
I have also tried changing modes in using the ECR register
at base + 0x402 but still no interrupts.
Does anyone know what might be going on with this card? Does
anyone have similar experience with this card?
Thanks once again,
Daniel
