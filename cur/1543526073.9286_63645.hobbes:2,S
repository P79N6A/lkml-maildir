Ok, the final patch I've seen looks ok,
	... BUT ...
I think we shoul dstart getting rid of /dev files for random new devices.
I'd MUCH rather just see a /proc/sys/xxx file, which has the advantage of
(a) needing no user-level setup (b) not having major/minor number issues
and (c) making it trivial to see if the kernel has the microcode update
support or not.
Special character devices are a weakness of UNIX, not a strength. We have
enough of them already. If they are virtual devices, then give them a
virtual interface..
