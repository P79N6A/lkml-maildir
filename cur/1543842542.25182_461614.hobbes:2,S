[Resend with bugs fixed.]
This patch set includes all the non-controversial tulip patches from
the parisc tree, plus a few extra cleanups.  The major highlight is
the patch moving tulip_select_media() and its associated delay to a
work queue, a nice piece of work from Francois Romieu, with some
tweaks by Kyle McMartin.
