Hi there.
There appears to be a problem with NFS on my [recently acquired]
laptop, so I'm hoping somebody can advise...
Scenario: Toshiba T2110 laptop, 800M H/D dual-partitioned between
Win95 and RedHat Linux 5.2, the latter installed via NFS using a
PCMCIA card plugeed into the University's network.
When I'm plugged into the Uni's network, I often mount the SunSITE UK
mirror as an NFS drive, thus making it much easier to download
software from the said mirror. However, I find that once mounted, I
can't unmount the said mirror!!! At least, not unless I reboot the
laptop...
For reference, I do exactly the same from a desktop PC alongside the
laptop, and that has no problem unmounting the mirror afterwards, so
this seems to be some sort of hardware specific problem. The only
thing separating the PC from the laptop is a single length of BNC
ethernet cable...PC one end, laptop the other...
Any suggestions MUCH appreciated...
Best wishes from Riley.
