Ok, how about these:
# lspci -v -s 2:5.0
02:05.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21142/43 (rev 41)
	Subsystem: Digital Equipment Corporation DE500 Fast Ethernet
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 96, IRQ 3
	I/O ports at c400 [size=128]
	Memory at db002000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1K]
	Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=256K]
# lspci -n -s 2:5.0
02:05.0 Class 0200: 1011:0019 (rev 41)
and (another machine runing something "old" at the moment):
# lspci -v -s 0:5.0
00:05.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21140 [FasterNet] (rev 22)
        Subsystem: Unknown device 1025:0310
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 18
        I/O ports at 8000
        Memory at 0000000004200000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
# lspci -n -s 0:5.0
00:05.0 Class 0200: 1011:0009 (rev 22)
This is what I happen to have on hands right now.

Lucky you!  The same goes for me if you do s/2.4/2.2/. :-)

Well, the vendor seems to be tulip designers and for a board type I had
exactly the same results with various x86 and Alpha boards.
If you will search through linux-kernel archives you will notice that
some people were able to restart a network with 2.4 tulip drivers by
unplugging a cable and plugging it back.  Even this trick does not work
in my case.  Yes, I am aware about negotiation troubles with tulips.
Forcing speed also does not help. 'de4x5' is still fine or you will be
not reading this. :-)
