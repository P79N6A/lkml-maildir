Future versions of Linux (>2.4) may support iovec skbuffs. Most drivers 
solve the problem by using rx_copybreak variable. If the packet is < 
rx_copybreak it is copied into a right sized buffer, if it is >rx_copybreak
it is passed directly from the driver. E.g. the tulip driver uses
rx_copybreak == 100. For those small packets the memcpy is in the noise.
