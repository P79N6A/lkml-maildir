Christoph that code was written over 6-7 years ago, feel free to provide a 
patch for it to use the slab allocator, we only turn this code on though 
when developing new drivers, I don't think it ever gets used outside of 
that.. we don't need the overhead of the memory tracking in normal use..
Please stop implying that all the code in the drm is magically new and 
that we should be reusing kernel infrastructure that wasn't even written 
when the code first appeared.. or provide patches...
Dave.
