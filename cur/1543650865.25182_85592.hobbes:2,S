Quite frankly, I probably _would_ accept it, if it's cleanly done. If only 
because of the fact that it's such a ridiculous thing to do, and thus gets 
high points on my "surreality meter".

Yeah, I think xiafs has little to do with a feature freeze. It has little 
to do with sanity too, for that matter. I saw that Andries still has one 
xia floppy somewhere, and that probably puts him in a rather unique 
position. I can't imagine that very many people really care, but it's a 
ironic form of retrocomputing...
