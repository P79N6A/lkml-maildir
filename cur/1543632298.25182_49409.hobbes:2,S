- Since Bartek has released finally an entierly user space based setup
    monitoring utility, we can finally remove the nonfunctional PROC code from
    the host chip drivers. We have preserved it thus far only for documentation
    purposes.
- Use generic bus master DMA setup code. There is nothing wrong with it.
- Make the ide-scsi code actually just allow for one device id per scsi host,
    since we are registering a host per device right now.  This prevents the
    repetitive device recognition. Well registering an SCSI host of every single
    disk out there isn't the proper thing to do. I will deal with that later
    after my visual perception recovers again from already looking too long at
    the SCSI code :-).
- Deal properly with host specific data mapping. (Could be that solves some
    problems with the driver, which where in reality kernel data corruptions.)
- Homogenize flag handling for ATAPI drivers.
