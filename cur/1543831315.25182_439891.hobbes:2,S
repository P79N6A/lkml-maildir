So for the patch mentioned earlier in the thread I have no problems.
And I think it makes sense for arch independent code not to care.
But for x86 I am much less convinced.

You mean besides the fact that the MPspec requires it and reboots
become much more reliable when you do because you don't tickle BIOS bugs?
It is safe because we don't do it if the cpu is not online.

x86 cares, and has such code.  Now possibly that is just the generic
subarch, and voyager does not share that code.  But since the
subarch/arch code division is almost invisible on x86 it's hard to say.
