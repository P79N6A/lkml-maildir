This are the parametres rc.sysinit sets just before switching to the
selected run level:
# cat /etc/sysconfig/harddisks | grep -v "^#"
USE_DMA=0 MULTIPLE_IO=16
EIDE_32BIT=3
LOOKAHEAD=1
EXTRA_PARAMS="-u1"
I twicked them to improve performance, but the behaviour was the same 
(poor performance and ide=nodma to be able to boot) before these 
modifications. So, maybe they are wrong, but no the cause of the problem.

Sorry, I do not know either.

How can I get this information?
