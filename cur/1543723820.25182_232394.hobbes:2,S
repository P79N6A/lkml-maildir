I tested again with psmouse.proto=bare and psmouse.resetafter=3 and *internal* 
touchpad/keyboard *only*. Last time, I told you, there's no ovious effect and 
it still does not work. That might be correct for the external equipment, but 
with internal mouse, the effects are much more subtile:
psmouse.proto=bare
 -> Now the internal mouse behaves as bad as the external one! It jumps around 
like crazy and clicks everywhere. That means, problems No. 3 and No.4 now 
also apply to the internal mouse!
 -> But problem No. 5 is resolved! Clicking on the touchpad does a button-1 
click.
psmouse.resetafter=3
 -> Problems No. 1 and No. 2 now become much worse! That means when moving the 
mouse cursor, cursor often stops/blocks. Then I have to keep the fingers off 
the touchpad for several seconds, before I can continue to move the mouse. 
Either regardless of the system load, or the lowest system load can start 
this effect, that's not so clear.
 -> Also the cursor now jumps much more than ever before.
So, that might be a way for a workaround: Can "reset" be disabled, e.g. 
secifying "psmouse.resetafter=0"?
