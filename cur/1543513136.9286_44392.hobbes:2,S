	That is your collected opinnion/wisdom for the user-space.
	Let kernel, and kernel/user interface (for LFS/64 syscalls)
	handle it as 64-bit entity, and you need to write new wrapper-
	interfaces for them too..
	Thwn when there really comes some case where 64-bit entity is
	needed for USERSPACE, we cross that bridge and change glibc's
	external 'struct stat64' and other places where __ino64_t needs
	to be 64-bit.
	However because for kernel/user interface doing changes is
	painfull, all such changes must be done once, and all the way.
