One thing I don't like is when files on the mirror get corrupted or
only partially downloaded. As far as I can tell, there appears to be
problems with some of the mirroring packages, or alternatively with
the server at ftp.kernel.org when it's used by mirroring software,
which result in the mirror getting a corrupted copy of some files.
Don't laugh: A similar problem existed at one time with one of the
sites I mirror, and was due to a bug in the ftpd server at the remote
end. The bug was only activated by mirroring software, not by the
manual ftp sessions, because it only took effect when commands came in
at the sort of speed common with mirroring software - maybe you can
type a dozen or so commands per second, but few other people can...
Incidentally, the SunSITE-UK mirror carries all files in the mirrored
directories, but it appears that ftp.kernel.org isn't that consistant
about the compressor it uses. As an example, whilst it has both .gz
and .bz2 versions of many of the kernels, a large number of the 0.xx
kernels are only provided in .Z format.
Also, as previously stated, I have collected a fair number of kernel
tarballs for kernels that are apparently not to be found on the
ftp.kernel.org site. Granted, I'm only storing them in .bz2 format for
reasons of space, but if ftp.kernel.org wishes to take them off my
hands and put them on its site, that should ensure that they appear on
the mirrors soon after, thus helping everybody...
Best wishes from Riley.
