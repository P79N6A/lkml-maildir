Well,  call_usermodehelper here _is_ async.  We're just waiting for
acknowledgement that the subprocess has safely taken copies of
our local data (argv, envp, etc).  And waiting to pick up the
return value from execve().
We can't call schedule_task() and then just return from
call_usermodehelper(), unless we take kmalloced copies of
everything (including the tq_struct) and then free them
after the vfork.
