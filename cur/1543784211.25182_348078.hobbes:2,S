Hi!

Yes, and that's okay.
 What happens to devices during swsusp? They seem to be resumed
during system suspend?
A: That's correct. We need to resume them if we want to write image to
disk. Whole sequence goes like
      Suspend part
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~
      running system, user asks for suspend-to-disk
      user processes are stopped
      suspend(PMSG_FREEZE): devices are frozen so that they don't
interfere
                      with state snapshot
      state snapshot: copy of whole used memory is taken with
interrupts disabled
      resume(): devices are woken up so that we can write image to
swap
      write image to swap
      suspend(PMSG_SUSPEND): suspend devices so that we can power off
      turn the power off
      Resume part
      ~~~~~~~~~~~
      (is actually pretty similar)
      running system, user asks for suspend-to-disk
      user processes are stopped (in common case there are none, but
with resume-from-initrd, noone k\nows)
      read image from disk
      suspend(PMSG_FREEZE): devices are frozen so that they don't
interfere
                      with image restoration
      image restoration: rewrite memory with image
      resume(): devices are woken up so that system can continue
      thaw all user processes
