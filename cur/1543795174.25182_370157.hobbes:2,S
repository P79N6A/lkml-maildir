I don't think I see the point.  This would let you optimize for the
"multi-threaded, but hasn't created any threads yet" or even
"multi-threaded, but not right now" cases.  But those really aren't the
interesting case to optimize for - that's the equivalent of supporting
CPU hotplug.
The interesting case is when you know at static link time that the
library is single-threaded, or even at dynamic link time.  And it's
easy enough at both of those times to handle this.  In many cases glibc
doesn't, because it's valid to dlopen libpthread.so, but that could be
accomodated - a simple matter of software.
