Good point, and correct - I have mostly been testing this with the
NET_DMA offload. async_tx doesn't make use of just memcpy, does it?
Also, how is DMA_INTERRUPT supposed to work? I see there's a separate
"prep_dma_interrupt" function, but that doesn't make sense to me. Don't
you want the interrupt associated with a specific transaction instead
of added as a separate (empty) transaction?
Once I add the descriptor to the ring, I can't change it to set the
interrupt request bit on it. I suppose I could just add a dummy descriptor
to the ring, but that doesn't seem quite right either.

Can't do that if it's called both from the polling as well as the IRQ
context, it'd need to hold off irqs. I.e. once I add the DMA_INTERRUPT
support it will be needed.
