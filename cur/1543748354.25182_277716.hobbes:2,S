	Hi David,
	There is some trivial fixes for some serious driver bug that
did show up in my mailbox. Because the fixes are trivial and the bug
serious, I would like to push that into 2.6.10 final.
	I tested the irda-usb patch, and Stephen tested the stir4200
patch. The VIA driver case is messy : I did the minimal fix that I
could get away with, because I don't have the hardware to test and the
proper fix will require much more work.
	Just push that up ;-)
	Jean

irXXX_stir4200-kill-1.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Original patch from Stephen Hemminger>
USB changed behaviour of unlink_urb so that it gives warning and backtrace when
being used synchronously. The correct current behaviour is to us kill_urb
in that case.

ir260_irda-usb-kill-2.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Original patch from Stephen Hemminger>
Updates for irda-usb.
        * change comment about Sigmatel now that there is a driver
        * convert to new module_param
        * places where urb is unlinked synchronously, use usb_kill_urb
          because that is now a runtime warning.
