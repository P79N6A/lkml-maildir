Okay. its already done.

I don't see need for doing this for hugetlbfs inodes. Currently, they 
don't base their
name on "key" + basing on the "key" is kind of useless anyway (its not 
unique).

I don't think, the user-space can depend on the dentry-name. It can only 
depend
on inode# to match shmid. (since key is not unique esp. for key=0x00000000).
BTW, I agree that shmid is not unique even without namespaces as its 
based on
seq# and we wrap seq#.
