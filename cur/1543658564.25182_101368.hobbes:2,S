Hi Ruslan,
I haven't had a chance to test this yet but everything does look ok.  I
think it will be ready once the below function is completed.  Jaroslav,
any comments?  Also, if anyone has a built in wavetable, as previously
mentioned by Zwane, I'd like to hear how this patch works for you.  This
patch makes full use of pnp card services, which is prefered for cards
that have several closely related devices, and it would be great to 
further test those code paths.
Thanks,
Adam
