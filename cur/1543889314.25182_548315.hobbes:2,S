I notice that feature-removal-schedule.txt has CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING 
scheduled to go away most of a year ago.  My question is what replaces it:
Does #define inline __always_inline become the new standard and uses of 
__always_inline be removed, or should all instances of "inline" either be 
removed or replaced with __always_inline?  (Or are there going to be two 
keywords meaning exactly the same thing going forward?)
