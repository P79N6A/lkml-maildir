Exactly. Linus (see CodingStyle) thinks non-8-tabs are heretic movements,
but well, let those people have their fun.
People should not be forced (by means of checker scripts that are officially
endorsed) to compress / {8}/ into a \t. In fact, people should not even
assume a tab is 8 when writing code. Instead,
\t	while (foo) {
\t	\t	bar = some_function_with_lots_of_args(par1, par2, par3,
\t	\t	\x20+ par4, par5, par6);
\t	}
\t should be used for "leading indent" only. Too bad almost noone cares.
