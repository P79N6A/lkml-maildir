Everyone is invited to the NUMA BOF at the Ottawa Linux Symposium
Friday Jun 29th, 2007 19:00 - 20:00 in Rockhopper
The main interest seems to be a discussion on the use of memory policies. 
Lee Schermerhorn will talk a bit about his work and then I may say 
something about the problems with memory policies.
More subjects:
- Memoryless node support
- Restricting subsystems to not allocate on certain nodes
  (f.e. huge pages only on some nodes, slab only on some nodes,
  kernel memory only on some nodes).
- Cpusets and containers
- Do we need to have more support for multicore issues in the NUMA layers?
- Issues with the scheduler on NUMA. 
If you have another subject that should be brought up then please contact 
me.
