I recently installed RH 6 on an x86 based box. As I need to upgrade my
kernel to add some hardware support, I downloaded the 2.2.12 tarball
(which I have been running on my main PC for a while now). I first removed
all of the RH kernel rpms, created a directory called 2.2.12 in /usr/src
and created a symlink /usr/src/linux to /usr/src/linxu-2.2.12. I then
untarred the new kernel in /usr/src which put everything is what appears
to be the right place. 
I sucessfully completed make xconfig and make dep, however when I attempt
to created the kernel image with "make bzImage", I receive the following
error:
[root@rh60-01 linux]# make bzImage
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-include
scripts/split-include.c
In file included from /usr/include/errno.h:36,
                 from scripts/split-include.c:26:
/usr/include/bits/errno.h:25: linux/errno.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [scripts/split-include] Error 1
If anyone has any tips I would greatly appreciate them! After compiling a
few dozen kernels over the past year or two, this kind of has me stumped.
