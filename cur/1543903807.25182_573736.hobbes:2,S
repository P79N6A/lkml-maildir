what Arjan is saying is one time unit at 2GHz with both cores busy, one 
time unit at 1GHz with both cores idle (this would be 132w/two time units 
vs 143W/two time units) still a win for running a 1GHz, but a smaller one
or better still, one time unit at 2GHz with both cores busy, one time unit 
in sleep mode, in this case if the sleep mode is any good at all it wins.
