Hello all,
Tonight I installed patch-2.6.5.gz to a 2.6.4 build tree - patch file 
from:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/
and whilst building, GCC exited with Error 1 in:
include/linux/module.h: Line 53
const struct exception_table_entry *
I couldn't see anything wrong (as if _I_ would know anyway ;) ), but 
guessed a bit, so removed the white space and re-added it, plus 
newlined it at the end, all in nano, and then the build all worked 
OK.
Looks like a strange char is added somewhere in that patch (or patch 
tool adds it?).
Regards,
Nick
