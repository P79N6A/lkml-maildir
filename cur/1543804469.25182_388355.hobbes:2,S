Looking at the official 3.4.x, 4.0.x, and the prerelease 4.1 sources I can't see such a warning, nor am I getting it
with 3.3.3 when building on SLES9 (which makes me assume unmodified 3.3.3 doesn't have this either). I thus wonder
whether the compiler used there has an extra, ill patch (after all there's generally nothing wrong for a read-write
constraint to only allow memory on x86). Jan

I only tested with gcc 4.0 and 4.1 prereleases where it worked just fine.
 __asm__ __volatile__( LOCK_PREFIX
                "btrl %1,%0"
                :"+m" (ADDR)
                :"dIr" (nr));
I tried to covert them from +m to explicit input/output
arguments ("=m" (ADDR) : "0" (ADDR)) to fix your compiler 
but with that I get the the same warning as you with 3.4 with 4.0.
Don't know how else it could be written. 
Ok one could just pass the address and do a full memory clobber, but 
that would be a overly large sledgehammer for the problem.
Jan or Andreas - do you have any suggestions how to fix this or should
we revert back to the old (technically wrong) state which was
    __asm__ __volatile__( LOCK_PREFIX
                "btrl %1,%0"
                :"=m" (ADDR)
                :"dIr" (nr));
Thanks,
-Andi
