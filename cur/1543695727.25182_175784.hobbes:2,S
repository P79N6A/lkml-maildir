Subject: [PATCH] Multi-head fix for tdfxfb driver

Hi All
This patch (against 2.6.0-test9) corrects a bug in the tdfxfb driver with
regard to multi-head set-ups. The driver was stomping all over its default
fb_fix_screeninfo struct (the global, tdfx_fix) when initializing a card -
which could potentially causes problems when the time comes to set up the
next card. This fix makes it copy tdfx_fix first and modify only that copy.
Cheers,
Rich
