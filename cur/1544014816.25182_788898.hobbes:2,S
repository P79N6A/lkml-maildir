You are free to keep your core time in whatever form you wish, but if 
you want your time_t to be POSIX compatible when accessed over POSIX 
interfaces you would need to honour the POSIX time_t mapping. While 
POSIX tried to avoid the leapsecond issue, the mapping they do perform 
has a peculiar effect on what happends on time_t if you also want to 
honour the UTC to time_t mapping while accepting UTC from external sources.

It just *appears* to be the number of "seconds" since 1970. This 
appearence is important to some and causing a greif to others.
