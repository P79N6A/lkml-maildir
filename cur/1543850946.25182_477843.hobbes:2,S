Hi all,
When a misc device file is registered, there are two files under my
own class directory:
/sys --> class --> misc --> myprog --> dev
                                                   --> uevent
                                                   --> myprog_show (to be added)
Now, my question is, is it possbile to add the third file
"myprog_show" under "myprog" directory without modify any common code?
I've read the doc under linux-2.6.x/Documentation, I can add it to
some other directory, but not found a way to add it to my own
directory.
Thanks for any help.
