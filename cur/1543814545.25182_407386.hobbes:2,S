I'm not sure I'm following you.  Is it OK for a driver to return from
its pci_driver .remove method with userspace mappings to MMIO BARs
still hanging around?  I wouldn't think so.
Non-privileged userspace processes can get direct access to (a safe
subset of) PCI space for IB devices, and it seems unfriendly to force
all of those processes to be killed before an IB device can be removed.
The way I think about it is that one doesn't have to kill every
process with a connected socket to remove an ethernet device, and I'd
like the same to hold for IB devices.  The analogy doesn't really hold
at a technical level I know, but it still seems like the friendliest
interface.
Thanks,
  Roland
