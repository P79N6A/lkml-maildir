Subject: X lockup on running after a resume

I did a suspend and resume from console before starting X or loading the
dri module.  after the resume completed I loaded th dri module and x and
X got up to the point where sawfish should have started and it locked
hard.  I have to assume it's dri related and I will try without dri
(since i dont play games I dont really need it anyway) and see if it
still locks up.  I haven't tried suspending and resuming while X is
already loaded.  Would be interesting to see the results of that too
though.
