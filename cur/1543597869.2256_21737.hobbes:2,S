The setrlimit() system call doesn't enforce rlim_cur <= rlim_max. This can
lead
to some unexpected results. For example, if you call setrlimit() with
RLIMIT_CPU with a hard limit of 60 secs, and a soft limit of "unlimited",
nothing will ever happen-- the hard limit is ignored, because it's never
checked if the soft limit hasn't been exceeded first (see kernel/timer.c).
     BSD had the same flaw-- always annoyed me. Simple fix (below). Diffs
are for 2.4.8.
