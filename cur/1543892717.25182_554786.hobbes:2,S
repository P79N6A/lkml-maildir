This patch series craps all over the existing one:
lguest-export-symbols-for-lguest-as-a-module.patch
lguest-the-guest-code.patch
lguest-the-host-code.patch
lguest-the-asm-offsets.patch
lguest-the-makefile-and-kconfig.patch
lguest-the-console-driver.patch
lguest-the-net-driver.patch
lguest-the-block-driver.patch
lguest-the-documentation-example-launcher.patch
obviously we could append this new series to the existing one, but that
limits our ability to make further changes over the next few weeks.  Or we
just give up trying to present the series nicely and it hits mainline with
a random stream of uninteresting and irrelevant afterthoughts at the end,
like we're some lameo git users or something.
(I could split all this up, but I'm getting kinda bored of preventing you
from mucking up your own patch series)
So... what course dost thou wish to take?
