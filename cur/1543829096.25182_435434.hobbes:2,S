Ok to spell it out (please correct me if I misinterpreted you). You want to:
- Split PDA into kernel part and user exportable part
- Export user exportable part to ring 3
- Put base address of user exportable part into GDT
- Access it using that.
I don't think it can work because the GDT only supports 32bit
base addresses for code/data segments in long mode and you can't put
a kernel virtual address into 32bit (only user space there) 
And you can't get at at the base address anyways because they
are ignored in long mode (except for fs/gs). For fs/gs you would
need to save/restore them to reuse them which would be slow.
You can't also just put them into fs/gs because those are
already reserved for user space.
Also I don't know what other information other than cpu/node 
would be useful, so just using the 20 bits of limit seems plenty to me.
