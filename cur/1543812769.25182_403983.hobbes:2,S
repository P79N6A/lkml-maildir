No, it looks as it is not :(
Have you noticed my comment about "count" argument to prune_dcache()?
For example, prune_dcache() is called from shrink_dcache_parent() which 
is called in many places and not all of them have PF_MEMALLOC or 
s_umount semaphore for write. But prune_dcache() doesn't care for super 
blocks etc. It simply shrinks N dentries which are found _first_.
So the condition:
+		if ((current->flags & PF_MEMALLOC) &&
+			!(ret = down_read_trylock(&s->s_umount))) {
is not always true when the race occurs, as PF_MEMALLOC is not always set.

here it is :)
Thanks,
