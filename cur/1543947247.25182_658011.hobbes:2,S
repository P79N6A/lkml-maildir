The clustered check is for Summit and es7000 systems
On 64bit systems it might be actually possible to trigger
this based on SLIT instead. But you'll need to check with
the IBM Summit/Unisys es7000 developers if that works or not
If you don't want to do that the safer way would be probably
the check if there are holes between the CPUs APIC numbers.
If yes then it's likely clustered mode. I think that would
be better than to disable it unconditionally for apic lifting
like your patches does.
