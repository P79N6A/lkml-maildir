Hi,
You said:
> I'm trying to implement a cache in a module. 
presumably you have investigated using general-purpose cache manager, i.e.
slab allocator and found it to be inadequate for your specific needs? It
is possible to think of a situation when slab is not perfect, e.g. imagine
a filesystem that allocate a million inode objects and then freed 500000
of them back to the slab. The next time the slab shrinks its caches, if
the objects happened to lie in different pages, it will keep the kernel
virtual address ranges used up, thus preventing from allocating large
(multi-page) objects... But those cases are very very special...
Regards,
