This is exactly why I included that CONFIG option in the first series.
Because, I only have a handful of hardware that actually uses tasklets.
And all those pr_debugs I had where turned on on most of my boxes.  I
was not flooded with prints either (every function including
tasklet_schedule had a print).
So, basically, I can't do benchmarks. I was hoping to get this into -mm
with a easy way for people, who have hardware that uses tasklets
extensively, to run it with tasklets on and off to see if there is a
difference.  My fear of not having a config option to switch between the
two (for -mm only) is that we may lose benchmarking from those that are
not comfortable at removing this patch from -mm.  There are people out
there that download and test the -mm tree straight from kernel.org.
Just because someone compiles their own kernel doesn't mean they can (or
will) patch it.
