OK, I did this (at least I think I got it right: the patch was happy) but
I can't see anything resembling DMI strings (even after I removed
frame-buffer so as not to nuke the first few messages).  What keywords etc
should I be seeing, at what point?
the only vaguely relevant message I see is:
	apm: BIOS version 1.1 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.13)
Thanks,
Neale.
