In further testing, this chunk is causing some problems.  It is entirely
legal for a buffer to be !uptodate here, although the path is somewhat
convoluted.  The trouble is, once the IO has completed,
journal_dirty_data() can steal the buffer from the committing
transaction.  And once that happens, journal_unmap_buffer() can then
release the buffer and clear the uptodate bit.  
I've run this under buffer tracing and can show you this exact path on a
trace.  It only takes a few seconds to reproduce under fsx.
For this to have happened, though, journal_dirty_data needs to have
waited on the data, so it has an opportunity to see the !uptodate state
at that point.
I think it's safe enough to sidestep this by double-checking to see
whether the bh is still on the committing transaction after we've waited
for the buffer and retaken journaling locks, but before testing
buffer_uptodate().
