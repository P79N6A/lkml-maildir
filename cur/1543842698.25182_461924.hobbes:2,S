Subject: [PATCH 0/4] proc: Misc cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/9/166

These patches are in response to the review of the last round
of my proc patches, and they remove one small glitch I found.
It turned out to be easy to remove the trailing empty directory entry
so I remove it, etc.
