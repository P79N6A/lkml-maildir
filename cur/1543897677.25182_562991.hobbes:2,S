Up to you.  What Ash tested was dropping the ldm.c and ldm.h that I  
emailed him into his kernel tree and compiling and booting.  Once he  
confirmed that it works and is parsing his LDM drives correctly I on  
my machine did "git diff > file", then scp-ed the file to the mail  
server, created a message in pine, and did "ctrl+r file" to insert it  
into the message.  After I had sent the message to you I exported the  
message to a file in pine, deleted the message text and did a diff  
with the original patch and it showed no differences.
What you refer to when I did the diff after the fact the diff failed  
with a line difference...  The patch had gotten corrupted (probably  
by me)...
So I can only assume it will work this time.
Best regards,
	Anton
