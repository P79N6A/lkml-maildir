Yes, *majorly* cool.  Between that tweak and the anticipatory scheduler,
it makes this laptop even more responsive than stock 2.5.70 was, and less
prone to hiccups - without -mm3, it was pretty easy to make xmms pause/skip
by suddenly hitting the disk with I/O.  I've been trying to make it skip
for an hour, even doing things like launching an X application while running
an MH 'scan' command on a 7,000 item folder (which involves an open, read,
close for 7,000 separate files), and that doesn't phase it at all..

It's noticeable on launching X apps on my laptop, and at boot time, I was
wondering if my init scripts were scrogged - [OK] after [OK] faster than
I'd seen before.
Amazing work, thanks Andrew (and all the contributors...)
