OK, I guess I'm convinced.  The vague language in the base PCI 3.0
spec about "dependencies" made me think that a read of a config
register had to wait until all previous writes to the same register
are done.  So I'll drop this patch for now.
John, you'll need to try and come up with a way to solve this in the
Altix implementation of pci_write_config_xxx().
