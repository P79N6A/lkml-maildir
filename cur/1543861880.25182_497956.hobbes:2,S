Actually, how about just removing the incrementing version count entirely?
I realize that it's really really old, and has been there basically since 
day one, but on the other hand, it's old not because it's fundamentally 
important, but because it's just been maintained. How about just dropping 
it entirely?
We have more useful _real_ versioning these days, with git commit ID's 
etc.
