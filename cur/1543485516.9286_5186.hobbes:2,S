Hi all.
I have an old adaptec scsi board in my machine (aha1542), and every time
i try to load the mods for scsi, i get the following trouble:
Configuring Adaptec (SCSI-ID 7) at IO:330, IRQ 11, DMA priority 5
scsi0 : Adaptec 1542
scsi : 1 host.
Wrong buffer length supplied for request sense (256)
And the system hangs. This occurs both with scsi compiled as modules or
inside kernel. I've enable SCSI support, Generic SCSI support, SCSI
disk, cdrom and tape support, and my aha1542 board.
Any ideas? Thanks.
