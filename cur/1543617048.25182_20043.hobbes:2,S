The machine that started this thread is a single processor Gateway 7450 
1U rackmount server with a two processor option.
Using the slightly better apic routing isn't going to make any
difference to its performance.  I think being able to avoid unstable
hardware/software interractions when they aren't needed is a great
idea and `noapic' should stay in.  This thread should be google-able
shortly and lead people with interrupt problems to the noapic workaround.
I also think that if this is a problem with Gateway's BIOS the best
solution is for them to fix it.  I will contact Gateway and see about
that today.
