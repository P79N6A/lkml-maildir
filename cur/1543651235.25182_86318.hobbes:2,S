	It's pretty much simple string substitution and it doesn't
touch that many files, but OK.

	Great.  The only thing I was going to do that might depend
on this patch is try to port /dev/loop to device mapper, and I may
be able to eliminate the affected code anyhow.
	I've checked in the change and will continue running it in the
meantime.  Unless I hear otherwise or run into a problem with this
patch, I'll plan to resubmit it around November 24.
