I can reproduce it reliably on my Dual-PII and on my K6, see my previous
mail on that topic.

I doubt it's such a trivial software issue. Leaving aside the ATX hang
I've experienced, it completely hangs my SMP box. No sysrq, no numlock
led. And I don't think the code disables IRQs globally. So even if the
driver's stuck in a tight loop with IRQs disabled locally, the other CPU
should still be functional and handle interrupts, shouldn't it? To me this
looks very much like somethings messing up the PCI bus, either the realtek
or the PCI bridge.

Your realtek homepage still mentions it as not yet set up. Could you
please update the comment?
