No -- there is still a bug.
The bug is that userspace can pass an address like 0x90000000 to the
kernel.  This is possible even on arm26.
If you follow the logic in getuser.S, it won't branch to
__get_user_bad, and it won't execute _either_ of the "ldrlst" or
"ldrge" instructions.
So it'll end up returning the value that happens to be in r1 and/or
r2, and using that for the syscall, instead of the syscall returning
-EFAULT as it should.
In rare cases, that's a security information leakage.  Usually it's
just rubbish.
