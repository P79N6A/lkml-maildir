Subject: [PATCH] blk: fix tag shrinking (revive real_max_size)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

 Hello, Andrew.
 The patch posted in the following mail (from me) incorrectly removed
blk_queue_tag->real_max_depth.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111399777404464&w=2
commit: fa72b903f75e4f0f0b2c2feed093005167da4023
 The original resize implementation was incorrect in the following
points.
 * actual allocation size of tag_index was shorter than real_max_size,
   but assumed to be of the same size, possibly causing memory access
   beyond the allocated area.
 * bits in tag_map between max_deptn and real_max_depth were
   initialized to 1's, making the tags permanently reserved.
 In an attempt to fix above two bugs, I had removed allocation
optimization in init_tag_map and real_max_size.  Tag map/index were
allocated and freed immediately during resize.  Unfortunately, I
wasn't considering that tag map/index can be resized dynamically with
tags beyond new_depth active.  This led to accessing freed area after
shrinking tags and led to the following bug reporting thread on
linux-scsi.

 To fix the problem, I've revived real_max_depth without allocation
optimization in init_tag_map, and Andrew Vasquez confirmed that the
problem was fixed.  As Jens is not going to be available for a week,
he asked me to make sure that this patch reaches you.

 So, here's the patch.  The patch is against today's Linus git head
(2f60f8d3573ff90fe5d75a6d11fd2add1248e7d6).  The patch also applies to
linux-2.6.13-rc4-mm1 with offset of 1.  I apologize for the bug and
hassle.  Thank you.

 Revive blk_queue_tag->real_max_size.  Previous commit
fa72b903f75e4f0f0b2c2feed093005167da4023 incorrectly removed this
field breaking dynamic shrinking of tags.  This patch revives
real_max_size sans buggy allocation optimization the original code
had.  Also, a comment was added to make sure that real_max_size is
needed for dynamic shrinking.
