I'm not a lawyer, but claim 1 in that document specifically talks about 
having an RTOS that runs a general purpose OS.
Does that limit the rest of the claims to only apply in the context of 
that scenario?
In the case of preempt-RT there is only the one OS involved, so if the 
claims are limited to the case where the general OS runs on top of an 
RTOS, it would seem that the patent does not apply.
