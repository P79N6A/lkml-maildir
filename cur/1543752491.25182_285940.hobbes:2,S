A fyi directed to other users: It was the nvidia module. Xorg nv is
fine. Did a CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y kernel and am attaching the output.
Turning on relevant debugging options in "Kernel hacking" hides the bug
(ie prevents it from happening). Very annoying and is a behaviour I've
seen before with other bugs. The price of kernel complexity, I guess.
