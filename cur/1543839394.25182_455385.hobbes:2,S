BTW, let's have _one_ email which describes what problem it is, the
hardware which its being seen on, the kernel configuration, what
modules are loaded, the lspci output and so forth.  Let's not spread
all the information over 20 emails.
I just can't work with dribbled small bits of inforamtion sparsely
spread.  Neither can I work when it takes days to get that information -
I forget both the reported details and the thread of thought I was
following to maybe work towards a conclusion.
(Though at present I'm rather devoid of ideas in this area.)
