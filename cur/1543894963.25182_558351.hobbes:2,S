yeah - and from everything i know about this subject the distinction 
between contract and license is small and more of a technicality - but 
still, it's a nice touch that the "pure license" argument that the FSF 
has advanced for a long time (and which it is now more silent about, 
given the GPLv3's not so pure structure) neatly defeats the common 
argument:
  "but, but, when i received the Tivo with GPL-ed software on it the 
   GPLv2 was not intended to be like that, there is a right to run 
   modified software on the hardware!"

yeah. But the argument goes a bit further: people who chose to _license_ 
the kernel (by receiving a Tivo for example and downloading its kernel 
source) claim that _their_ interpretation of the GPL is that of the 
FSF's and that Tivo ought to follow it. The whole "Tivo is cheating the 
GPL deal with the end users" line of PR. As far as license 
interpretation goes there is _no end user deal_ and the 'end user' does 
not even play in terms of intent - only if she choses to be an active 
member of the community. That's why i think it's better to talk about a 
license than a contract. (even though legally, at least in the US, the 
two are quite close to each other.)
so a 'pure copyright license' stresses the point even more that you only 
really count in the ecosystem if you contribute in one way or another. 
The system should be and _is_ assymetric towards the actual black letter 
text of the license and, as a second layer, towards the intent of the 
people who actually produced this 1+ billion lines of code, 
documentation, bugzilla entries and other nice works. And that is a 
thing the FSF is missing sometimes i believe - the "listen to _all_ the 
people who enabled this cool stuff" part.
