Slightly off topic, but let me report a "metoo" as far as testing -git
goes (you can even find a suspend2-against-current-git tree on
kernel.org now!), and some positive progress: for the first time in
months, I'm reliably suspending and resuming my amd64 based laptop. I
don't have an exact cause, but would guess at Andi's multitude of
patches and/or any cpufreq fixes that might have slid in there too. It's
been really strange writing software that others can use reliably, and
not being able to reliably use it yourself! Kudos to all the authors of
suspend/resume bug fixes that have gone in!
