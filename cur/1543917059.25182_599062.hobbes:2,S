it's not doing the right thing at all. I had a quick look at the source 
code, and the reason for that weird yield usage was that there's a 
locking bug in iperf's "Reporter thread" abstraction and apparently 
instead of fixing the bug it was worked around via a horrible yield() 
based user-space lock.
the (small) patch below fixes the iperf locking bug and removes the 
yield() use. There are numerous immediate benefits of this patch:
 - iperf uses _much_ less CPU time. On my Core2Duo test system, before 
   the patch it used up 100% CPU time to saturate 1 gigabit of network 
   traffic to another box. With the patch applied it now uses 9% of 
   CPU time.
 - sys_sched_yield() is removed altogether
 - i was able to measure much higher bandwidth over localhost for 
   example. This is the case for over-the-network measurements as well.
 - the results are also more consistent and more deterministic, hence 
   more reliable as a benchmarking tool. (the reason for that is that
   more CPU time is spent on actually delivering packets, instead of
   mindlessly polling on the user-space "lock", so we actually max out
   the CPU, instead of relying on the random proportion the workload was
   able to make progress versus wasting CPU time on polling.)
sched_yield() is almost always the symptom of broken locking or other 
bug. In that sense CFS does the right thing by exposing such bugs =B-)

fix iperf locking - it was burning CPU time while polling
unnecessarily, instead of using the proper wait primitives.
