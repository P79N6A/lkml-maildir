Subject: [2.6 patch] i386 APIC Kconfig cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/23/53

This patch contains the following changes to arch/i386/Kconfig:
- update the X86_UP_APIC and X86_UP_IOAPIC help texts:
  - in the SMP case, these options are not visible
  - today, it's no longer only "a small number of uniprocessor systems"
    that have an IO-APIC
- there were two X86_LOCAL_APIC and two X86_IO_APIC options -
  in both cases, merge them
- move X86_VISWS_APIC to the other APIC options
Please review this patch (it shouldn't have any visible effects).
