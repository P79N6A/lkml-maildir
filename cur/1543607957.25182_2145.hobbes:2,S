Sigh. There's just no clean way of fixing this with the current
code. I'll probably just do what I've been avoiding, which is to
allocate temporary buffer space in the readlink() and follow_link()
methods, and free it prior to return. However, I'll be travelling for
the next couple of days, and will be out of 'net contact. But feel
free to code up a patch along these lines :-)
After this, I really want to avoid band-aid fixes and instead
concentrate on getting the new code to a usable state, since so many
of these problems are not there in the new code.
