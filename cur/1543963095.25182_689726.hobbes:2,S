Ok, so at least the BIOS and driver views of the topology are
consistent...  The firmware supports up to 126 devices in a FCAL
topology, so there's no HBA limit that is being run into here.
You mentioned that if you remove the originally visible drives, then
the driver/BIOS can see the previously non-visible drives -- perhaps
there is some limitation with the storage enclosure you are using...
