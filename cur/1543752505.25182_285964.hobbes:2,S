Dmitry,
I have placed the results of the patched 2.6.9-rc2-bk2 kernel at the 
following address:
http://roey.freeshell.org/mystuff/kernel/
*-20050112
As expected, the system was unresponsive to keyboard input.
Regarding your mouse question:
How do I test the mouse if they keyboard does not work (is there some 
way to output the contents of /dev/psaux on startup? I'm not sure anymore 
what file the mouse data appears in, too)
- Roey
