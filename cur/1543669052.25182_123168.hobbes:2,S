You didn't read the patch, but you said it was a bad idea.  Do you
wonder why people don't send patches through you? 8(

Oh good: a serious question.  Why don't we drop the personality field
in struct task_struct and just use exec_domain?  Then the flags could
be unfolded from the personality number, and placed in a "flags"
element in struct exec_domain, the personality() macro would vanish,
the set_personality() macro would vanish, and things would be
generally clearer?
Perhaps there's some future aim you have in mind which conflicts with
this, or is it just a "not done yet".

That applies to any kernel mod, of course.  qemu is much more usable
(ie. it's sanely packagable) with this functionality, ie. it's pretty
much a requirement for increasing adoption.

I discussed this with Paul M, too.  You can do it *iff* you drop it on
exec, otherwise you get chroot-like security issues.
Cheers,
Rusty.
