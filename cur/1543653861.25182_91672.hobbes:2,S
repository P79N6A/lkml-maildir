Subject: [PATCH] Beginnings of conpat 32 code cleanups

Hi Linus,
There is a lot of duplicated code among the 32 compatibility layers in our
64 bit architectures.  I am proposing to considate this as much as
possible. To that end, I first need to tidy up the relevant header files
and make them as common as possible.  Discussions with Dave Miller, Andi
Kleen, and Anton Blanchard has led to the creation of compat32.h to
contain all the 32 compatibility data types.
This patch merely adds include/asm-generic/compat32.h which is the header
information that is common to all the 32 bit compatibility code across all
the architectures (except parisc as I don't pretend to understand that
:-)).
I will follow this up with patches for each architecture that I can. I
also intend to intruduce a CONFIG_COMPAT32 define that will be used to
wrap generic implementations of some of the 32 bit compatibility code in
our architecture independent code.  The idea is to share as much of the
non compatibility code and where that is not possible, to keep the 32 bit
versions of code near their "normal" (i.e.64 bit) counterparts in order to
minimise the number of bugs introduced and maximise the number of bugs
fixed.
