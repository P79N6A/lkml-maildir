Jeff, please always make patch and ChangeLog match. Yes, it matters - when it 
doesn't happen there's always something bad going on.

What's this? It's IMHO invalid. free_area_init() intereprets these values with 
include/linux/mmzone.h: ZONE_* constants.
Why those are not used here it's a nice question.
I think this came up because there's (in -mm) Andi Kleen created a new zone 
(ZONE_DMA32) for devices using 32-bit only DMA - but it seems it's not in 
mainline).  (I don't know if that patch is in -mm actually, but I guess it 
from this patch content).
Actually, since MAX_NR_ZONES is 3, and we are assigning to zones_size[3],
we're corrupting data:
        unsigned long zones_size[MAX_NR_ZONES], vaddr;
Don't drop the patch however, I'm fixing all this up.
