And if you cannot tell the allocator that I am using a specific address, then the allocator might very well give somebody else that portion of RAM. The only solution without a fixed allocator is to allocate ALL memory in the DP RAM and use your own allocator.

Yeah, that too.
Too bad there are no main tree drivers like that, but they do exist.
One could conceivably hack genalloc to do that, but will end up with
something complex too.
BTW, there are other uEngine based architectures with similar alignment
requirements.
So in conclusion, for the in-tree drivers genalloc is sufficient as an cpm memory allocator.
For some out of tree drivers, it is not.
