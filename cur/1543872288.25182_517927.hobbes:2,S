Herbert, do you care to send patches except for ask others to do
something that works for you?
Looks like your main argument is non-intrusive...
"working", "secure", "flexible" are not required to people any more? :/

1. cpusets are hierarchical already. So hierarchy is required.
2. As it was discussed on the call controllers which are flat
   can just prohibit creation of hierarchy on the filesystem.
   i.e. allow only 1 depth and continue being fast.
>>mount -t container -o cpuset none /dev/cpuset	<- cpuset hierarchy

tend to agree.
Looks like Paul's original patch was in the right way.

I also hate filesystems approach being used nowdays everywhere.
But, looks like there are reasons still:
1. cpusets already use fs interface.
2. each controller can have a bit of specific information/controls exported easily.
Can you suggest any other extensible/flexible interface for these?
Thanks,
Kirill
