Text mode is slow and has poor resolution, yes even svga text mode stuff
is way slower than accelerated fbconsole for me, I don't like having to
wait for the screen to update when I page a file and go to the next
page.
And why require me to load X just to have a usuable system? Yes I think
when I have to switch consoles so a program doing a lot of screen output
doesn't block endlessly on my slow textmode display is unusable.
