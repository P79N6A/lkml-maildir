There might be some fodder there, but I doubt it.  I have
played with linux-lite-v1.00 (which is something like linux-1.09).
And couldn't get any really compelling results.  Plus for it to be
useful I would still need to backport all of the driver API's from
2.4.x.
Just for a note, UZI has been ported to x86 as UZIX so a 32KB kernel
(without a network stack is achievable on x86).  If I can get a core
kernel size with no drivers down to 64KB or less I would be happy.
So far I haven't been able to come up with anything satisfying.
