This patch does the trick. Survived several reboots now while without
the patch it has oopsed 100% of the time so far. Thanks!
I have also attached a full jbd debug output and oops for the vanilla
2.6.16-rc1 case, just in case that helps.

mount,unmount doesn't seem to trigger it, nor does a bit of filesystem
activity. I haven't tracked down exactly what *does* trigger it, but
booting then rebooting does it every time.
