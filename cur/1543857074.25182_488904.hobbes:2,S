We have a problem with the new areca driver included
in kernel tree 2.6.19.
 
During the boot sequence we get this
output:
 
........................
Loading arcmsr.ko module
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:05:0e.0[A] -> Link
[LINKC] -> GSI 5 (level, low) -> IRQ 5

and keeps looping through all luns with different
values of ccd at each loop.
Till kernel panics because of the lack of root
device.
 
Here is our specs:
HW used:
ARC1220
ARC1110
on Supermicro X6DH8-XG2, Dual Xeon
3.0GHz
 
OS distro used:
CentOS 4.4 x86_64
Kernel 2.6.19 with hand-crafted config, that we are
able to use successfully with kernel 2.6.16.20.
 
Have you any suggestions to resolve this issue ?
 
Thanks in advance,
Filip Majewski
