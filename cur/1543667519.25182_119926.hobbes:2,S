No. It isn't that easy. And if they keep rejecting
what I tell them, without actually checking and
testing what's in their distributions, they will
go the way of other arrogant companies who refuse
to listen to their customers.
As Red Hat "matures", it's distributions become
more and more like Microsoft in "look and feel".
This replaces functionality with glamor. This
it not good. You can add whatever glamor the
marketing departments require as long as you don't
remove long-time accepted functionality. Once
you throw away the functionality, you end up
loosing market share.
It is important that Red Hat remain in business so
that the "nay-sayers" do not win their arguments and
there remains several viable companies employing
kernel developers. We all have a stake in the success
of these distributors. If we we fail to report problems
with distributions, we actually fail to help support
Linux. On the other hand, when a distributor rejects
these reports out-of-hand, the whole Linux community
will eventually suffer the consequences.
Here is the output of standard-error while executing
`make dep`. It's informative:

Now; I have attached the script, showing what I executed
to actually generate this. As previously reported by myself,
Version 8.0 even breaks the execution of `script` so there
is a lot of wrong console activity recorded.
I did not bother to go any further than `make oldconfig` and
`make dep` in this "Show-and-tell". As previously reported,
continuing with `make bzImage` will result in many errors and
the failure to compile. Further, what used to take a few minutes
to compile on that machine, now takes a whole day. This is
because something went wrong with the ext3 file-system which
Red Hat installed by default. The Red Hat installation never
asked me if I wanted to use ext3. It also didn't ask me if
I wanted a journal file-system. Instead, its arrogance
resulted in an unusable system that will have to be redone
as a long, time-consuming project.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
