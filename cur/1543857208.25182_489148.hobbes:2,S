David, you have to fix the locking scheme used in kernel/workqueue.c,
you absolutely cannot assume that cmpxchg() is available on all
platforms.  This breaks the build on the platforms that don't
have such an instruction, and no it cannot emulated.
Also, because Alan Cox's machine (zeniv) went down, a few folks such
as Al Viro (CC:'d) had no opportunity to comment on your changes
before they went in.  This mess would have been avoided if Al had a
chance to read over this, in particular since he does cross sparc32
builds he knows that cmpxchg is not available there.
