you are not referring to the 'synchronous wakeups' as used by fs/pipe.c,
right? in_interrupt() isolates interrupt-context wakeups (asynchronous
wakeups) and process-context wakeups - which can also be called
synchronous, in a way.
so i think your current patch should cover unix domain sockets just as
well, they certain dont use IRQ-context wakeups.
