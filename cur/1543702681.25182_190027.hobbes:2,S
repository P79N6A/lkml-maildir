I tried 2.6.1 with that option set as above, and also with it set to
base.  In both cases I don't seem to get tap-to-click.  In
2.6.1-rc1-mm1 with psmouse_noext=1, I get tap-to-click.

I notice that the passthrough appears as an extra device (mouse1 on my
system).  Is there a way to disable devices from userspace?  I did
find the place in the synaptics driver that looks like it is where the
passthrough port is registered, so I guess I could take that out as a
last resort.  But it's a pain having to remember to patch my kernel
every time I upgrade.
