It seems correct. You cannot expect TCP packets to be sent if the
target is supposedly on a directly connected network and ARP cannot
get its MAC address. What should the IP layer put as the MAC address
if it is unknown?
You may want to run another test with another unreachable target
located after a router, so that the MAC address of the router is used
on the wire. You should see all the TCP retransmits you expect to see.
