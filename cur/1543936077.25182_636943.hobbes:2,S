One of the test systems I have has following E820
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009cc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009cc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000cc000 - 00000000000d0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000e4000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 00000000cff60000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cff60000 - 00000000cff69000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cff69000 - 00000000cff80000 (ACPI NVS)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cff80000 - 00000000d0000000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000e0000000 - 00000000f0000000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fec00000 - 00000000fec10000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fee00000 - 00000000fee01000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000ff000000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000100000000 - 0000000130000000 (usable)
I think it is unsafe to access any reserved areas through "WB" not just
mmio regions. In the above case 0xe0000000-0xf0000000 is one such
region.
Also, relying on MTRR, is like giving more importance to BIOS writer
than required :-). I think the best way to deal with MTRR is just to not
touch it. Leave it as it is and do not try to assume that they are
correct, as frequently they will not be.

I don't like /dev/mem supporting access to mmio. We do not know what
attributes to use for these regions. We can potentially map all these
pages uncacheable. But there may be cases where reading an address can
block too possibly?

E820 above has a combination of reserved and holes.
The problem is that we end up depending on specific e820s and paltform
specific problems/workarounds. This is not a real problem for i386 at
all, as we map only < 1G memory there. So, it is limited to x86_64
systems which should be less in number.
