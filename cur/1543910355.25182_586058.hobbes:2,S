Subject: [PATCH] rtc: Make rtc-ds1553 driver hotplug-aware (take 3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/19/58

The rtc-ds1553 platform driver name doesn't match its module name,
which might prevent it from properly hotplugging.  This driver has no
in-tree users.

The "take 2" of this patch was just a typo-fix ("1553" vs. "1742").
