	Serial console works fine for me. Did you build that feature into your 
kernel? Look under the 'Character devices' section in menuconfig.
( CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y )
This took me a bit to figure out, after having only read the serial-console.txt
in Documentation. It might be nice if that document mentioned that kernel
support has to be there.
	Also, reference the Serial-HOWTO...
