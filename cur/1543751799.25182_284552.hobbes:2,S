No objections; it certainly falls under "general-purpose library
helper".  Moreover, in this case I _insist_ on use of normal
export; it is a convenience helper that
	a) can be trivially reimplemented by anyone who cares; any
number of filesystems is open-coding far more than that in their
->get_sb(), so there's nothing to protect here.
	b) can be trivially simulated by simple_fill_super() followed
by a bit of tweaking the result.
	c) does not shove any pitchforks into the kernel guts - resulting
superblock does not require any special treatment.
So feel free to go ahead and export it; as the matter of fact, if you
don't do it, I will.  And that puppy is my code except for one line
from Andi Kleen (sb->s_time_gran = 1; ;-).  Since we both are OK with
full export (I'd just asked him), anybody who has objections to that
can take 'em and shove 'em...
