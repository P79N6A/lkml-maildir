that one is the hacker way, the most powerfull and most correct for sure :)
however the average user of an external device driver (in the specific case 
i'm interested in distributing the rivatv driver found at 
http://rivatv.sf.net
) is not going to have the source tree where the stock 
kernel he is running was built.
average users may have either a kernel-headers package that matches their 
running kernel and/or a souce package without the configuration stuff. in 
both cases 'the hacker way' doesn't work :)
OTOH, for small device drivers you don't need the full blown kernel CFLAGS, 
you know what you need anyway.
this is a user-, distribution-friendlyness issue :), we actually hit it in 
real life.
cheers,
