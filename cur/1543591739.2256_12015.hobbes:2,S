That pushes the third button.  I'm nervous that if we go down this path
we will end up with a thicket of modes and a combinatorial explosion
in ruleset complexity, leading immediately to a user configuration
experience that is more complex than necessary, and eventually to an
unmaintainable mess in the rulesfiles.
In order to prevent that happening, I would like to have some recognized
criterion for configuration cases that are so perverse that it is a 
net loss to accept the additional complexity of handling them within the
configurator.
A lot of people (including, apparently, you) are saying there are no such
cases.  I wonder if you'll change your minds when you have to handle the
overhead yourselves?
Sigh...
