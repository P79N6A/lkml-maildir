Marcelo,
I seemed to have missed the 2.4.29-pre stages, unfortunately.
Are you planning on a 2.4.30, too? I'd still love to get
iswraid accepted in the 2.4 tree eventually...
The version that's out on SourceForge right now would be alright
as is with the 2.4.29-x kernels, if that's any help. In about a
week I'm planning to have a new version that adds RAID10 support
for the ICH7R-based machines. Please let me know what my options
are (if any) regarding getting iswraid in 2.4.
Thanks very much,
