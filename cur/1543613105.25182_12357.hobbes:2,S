   Hmm I have it defined, just not in dma.h :) I'll fix it now and retest.
Oh nevermind then, the location really is almost arbitrary.
As long as scsi_merge.c sees it.
Note this is one area Jens hasn't been able to test and I've been
trying first to solidify my sparc64 setup without DMA_CHUNK_SIZE
defined.
