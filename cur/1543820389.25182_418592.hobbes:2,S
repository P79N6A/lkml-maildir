Maybe it should BUG_ON instead in that case. ;)
And strictly speaking, as long as the kref.c stuff is the only stuff to
play with ->refcount, that *should* be true.  On the other hand, if somebody
has a bad pointer that just did a fandango on core, it would be a nice thing
to know that.  Looking at the *next* few lines:
        if ((atomic_read(&kref->refcount) == 1) ||
            (atomic_dec_and_test(&kref->refcount))) {
                release(kref); 
                return 1; 
        }    
        return 0;
If we managed to get a -1 smashed in there, this won't actually trigger
for another 2**32-2 or so kref_put calls - the first test is for "exactly 1",
and the dec_and_test is for "exactly zero"...
