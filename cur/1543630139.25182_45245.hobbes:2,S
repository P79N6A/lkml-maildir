Build time is the least of your worries here.  All objects that export
symbols must have unique basenames, all the modversion crud goes in
include/linux/modules under the object's basename.  This is the main
reason that many subsystems have a subsystem_ksyms.c file, to get a
unique base name.
There are 34 files called inode in 2.4.18.  None currently export
symbols so adding EXPORT_SYMBOL to fs/inode.c is safe, until somebody
else decides they want their inode.c to export symbols.  You will not
notice until you build both systems with MODVERSIONS=y.
