Noooo.  copy_*_user() returns zero on success and "number of bytes
remaining to be copied" on fault.  The number of places in the kernel which
actually care about the precision of the "number remaining to be copied"
thing is very small.  Most places just test for non-zeroness.
The problem is that the current semantics are hard to implement on several
architectures.  To get it right, sparc64 has to go back and copy one byte
at a time just to work out the address at which the fault really occurred.
