Basically, you don't build any of the PXA platforms, which is what was

Which is quite impossible.  I've said all along that all*config is bad
news for ARM and folk haven't listened.
allmodconfig can (and does) work on some platform configurations such as
the one Andrew builds - which will be based on the Versatile platform.
However, that doesn't get _any_ of the PXA SoC drivers scattered throughout
the tree, the PXA SoC support in arch/arm/mach-pxa, none of the PXA platform
support files.
If you built an allmodconfig PXA configuration, you'd get those, but you
wouldn't get the OMAP SoC drivers, nor the ARM Primecell drivers found on
ARMs Integrator, Versatile and Realview platforms and the Cirrus EP93xx
SoCs.  Nor the Atmel AT91 drivers... and so the list goes on.
Each family of platforms are, unfortunately, quite distinct from each
other.
