Hi, 
Under heavy load (rc5des collective code cracking scheme) my machine
is prone to crashes. Following the guidelines in oops_tracing.text
the following output was generated:
-----------------------------------------------------
 
ot@chello ksymoops]# make ksymoops
make: `ksymoops' is up to date.
[root@chello ksymoops]# ./ksymoops < /var/log/oops
WARNING: This version of ksymoops is obsolete.
WARNING: The current version can be obtained from 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops
Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.13/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
Warning in compare_ksyms_lsmod, module awe_wave is in lsmod but not in ksyms, probably no symbols exported

Though there is a moaning messages in there about kernel and modules,
these _do_ match.
Further info (don't know if this is required): The mainboard is a
SuperMicro P6DBE with 2 slot1/PPGA adapters, with 2 Celeron300a's.
The fsb is @100MHz, therefore the cpu's are slightly overclocked to
450MHz. The temperatures of the cpu's are some 40 degr. C, which
seems OK.  I don't think i'm pushing the hardware too hard therefore.
I already tried the "append=noapic" param, this does not solve the
problem, though it generates different error messages, which (silly
me) i forgot to jot down.
If i should have posted this elsewhere, please forgive me, as i'm
quite new at this. If more info is needed, just let me know
Regards, 
Rienk
