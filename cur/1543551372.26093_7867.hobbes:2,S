ok, doing it from the bottom up was fine (didn't lockup) but reaching the
last (first in your list) entry was refused by mtrr:
mtrr: 0x0,0x100000000 overlaps existing 0xfeafe000,0x2000
# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0xfeafe000 (4074MB), size=   0kB: uncachable, count=1
reg01: base=0xfe9ee000 (4073MB), size=   0kB: uncachable, count=1
reg02: base=0xfe9ed000 (4073MB), size=   0kB: uncachable, count=1
reg03: base=0xfe800000 (4072MB), size=   1MB: uncachable, count=1
reg04: base=0xfde00000 (4062MB), size=   1MB: uncachable, count=1
reg05: base=0xfe000000 (4064MB), size=   8MB: write-combining, count=1
reg06: base=0x00100000000 (    4096MB), size=    2048MB: write-back,
count=1
and machine is still slow. So, what is the correct way to cover the 6G by
some mtrrs? I will now try to disable or change strategy of L2 caching in
BIOS and see if it makes things worse.
