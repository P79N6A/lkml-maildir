Hi.
I've just noticed that all the subject lines are off by one. Sorry.
Shall I repost with it right this time?
Regarding this x86_64 patch, I haven't been able to test x86_64 support
yet (no hardware here), so I'm sure you're right about all the things.
I've really just parroted what swsusp does in its lowlevel code, since
saving and restoring cpu state is one thing we do the same way.
Will apply changes.
Regards,
Nigel

Evolution.
Enumerate the requirements.
Consider the interdependencies.
Calculate the probabilities.
Be amazed that people believe it happened.
