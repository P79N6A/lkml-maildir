I don't understand, utf8 conversion table? fs/nls/nls_base.c has
conversion routines for utf8. Or do you mean tables showing what output to
expect, a file named xyz would show up as X in utf8?
You could try the "abc" charset for testing that the fs code is ok with
chars wider than > 1 byte. Multibyte chars in readable ascii, should
behave just like the 16bit codepages.
