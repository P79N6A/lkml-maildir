I guess this is unusual, but FWIW...
I have a custom distro and I was just looking for the easiest way to 
create a bootable rescue pen-drive. So I just took a working distro, 
added an init->sbin/init symlink, cpio'ed it into an initramfs, and 
booted it up. Works a treat, except for the early hotplug calls.
