I do not think this is neccessary. Userland daemon should not die. If
it dies, it closes device, and it is reasonable to hangup on such
event. (Hangup is just the right response - always. That's what
happens when you pull phone out of the socket.)

Scarab shows pty is good enough for SLIP to run over it. I do not
think we need much more.
