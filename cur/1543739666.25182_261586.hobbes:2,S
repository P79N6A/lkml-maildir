Greetings all;
Just a note to say that I've rebooted to 2.6.9-rc4, final is doing 
something to the x apps.  I've had mozilla 1.7.3 crash silently 5 or 
6 times since I booted to final, and kmail just died the same way 6 
times in about 20 minutes.  When they go away, you can click on the 
close button, and the system will eventually ask if you want to kill 
the app, so you do.  And when you restart it, the app has been 
totally restored to the place it was when it went out for lunch, and 
works normally again till the next time.
There are no messages in the logs when this occurs.  The only 
difference in the .config is I had turned an ATI option on in the agp 
section.
I'll turn it back off and try 2.6.9-final again.
-- 
Cheers, Gene
