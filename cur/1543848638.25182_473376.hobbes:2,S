But as we don't know we're probing an usb interface, we have no chance
of ensuring that dev->parent->sem is taken in the multithreaded case
(meaning we couldn't do multithreaded probe for usb). (Any idea why the
parent's sem must be taken for usb interfaces?)

->probe won't be called if the device is already being removed, but
that still results in bus->remove being called without a prior ->probe
(but not drv->probe since dev->driver is not set at that time).
