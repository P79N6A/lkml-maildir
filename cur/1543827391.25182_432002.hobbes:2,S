Ok, me likee. I just worry that this might break some older gcc version. 
Have you checked with gcc-3.2 or something?
We've had that "current_stack_pointer" thing for a long while, but we only 
use it in the irq-stack path (where it's really very incidental: the whole 
use of the "previous_esp" thing is only for the oops tracing. Maybe there 
was some reason (like gcc generating bad code) for not using it earlier?
(Admittedly, a more likely reason is probably just nobody looking at it, 
but it sounds like we should check it out anyway, just in case)
