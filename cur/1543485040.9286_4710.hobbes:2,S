Aehm,
I posted the one that is the result of a local discussion here on what
David describes as "good luck": 
Add
    priority = (struct sched_param *) malloc(sizeof(struct sched_param));
and it works. 
ftp://ftp.uni-freiburg.de/pub/linux/misc/tips/resched.c
is the non-discussed version. Thanks, David.
