Actually, 'handler' and 'lock' are initialised for you (see
kernel/irq/handle.c) so I think those two lines can just be deleted.
'action' is also initialised to NULL implicitly, so that can go.
I think setting 'status' and 'depth' like that is also unnecessary.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
