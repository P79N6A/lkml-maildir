Is it downloadable somewhere? If not, could you please send it to me?

Hmm. I see. So perhaps you may ask someone (James, Christoph, ...?) to 
revert that patch, because the scsi_cmnd->state is needed here for this 
purpose. It was removed just because nobody else was using it (at least 
thats what the patch description says). So, if you explain that it is 
necessary for this purpose, it could either be reverted, or you may be 
told of a way to get around it. (That's a result of that the driver didn't 
yet make it into the mainline. Before it does, mainline may change to a 
level that it would no longer be possible to apply it. :()
