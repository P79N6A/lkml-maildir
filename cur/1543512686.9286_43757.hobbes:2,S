How do you treat links? Can you do 'cat
index.html/file-that-is-linked-from-index.html' ? how do you, then, treat
circular links?
The problem here is that HTTP is content-oriented, not file system
oriented. Someone has done this for FTP (where it _does_ make sense)
already, I'll have to dig out the patch. I think a file system for HTTP is
kind of pointless.
Do a 'cache slow media on fast ones' file system instead, that will benefit
many people. like "mount server:/home -o cache=/tmp/nfs.cache,40960" :-)
Just my EUR 0.02...

Windows NT indeed has very low Total Cost of Ownership. Trouble is,
Microsoft _owns_ Windows NT. You just licensed it.
