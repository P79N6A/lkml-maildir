Unless I'm missing something that's only possible for a very static system. 
What I mean is that yes you could go and set irq affinity, apps affinity, 
workqueue thread affinity, etc not to run on the isolated cpus. It works 
_until_ something changes, at which point the system needs to know that it's 
not supposed to touch CPU N.
For example new IRQ is registered, new workqueue is created (fs mounted, net 
network interface is created, etc), new kthread is started, etc.
Sure we can introduce default affinity masks for irqs, workqueues, etc. But 
that's essentially just duplicating cpu_isolated_map.

No, not really.
Lets talk specifics. My goal was not to introduce a bunch of new functionality 
and rewrite workqueues and stuff, instead I wanted to integrated with existing 
mechanisms. CPU maps are used everywhere and exporting cpu_isolated_map was a 
natural way to make other parts of the kernel aware of the isolated CPUs.

I do not see a specific proposals here. The funny part that we're not even 
disagreeing on the high level. Yes It'd be nice to have such a flag ;-)
But how will genirq subsystem, for example, be aware of that flag ?
ie How would it know that by default it is not supposed to route irqs to the 
CPUs in the cpusets with that flag ?
As I explained above setting affinity for existing irqs is not enough.
Same for workqueus or any other susbsytem that wants to run per-cpu threads 
and stuff.

One way I can think of how to support groups and allow for RT balancer is 
this: Make scheduler ignore cpu_isolated_map and give cpusets full control of 
the scheduler domains. Use cpu_isolated_map to only for hw irq and other 
kernel sub-systems. That way cpusets could mark cpus in the group as isolated 
to get rid of the  kernel activity and build sched domain such that tasks get 
balanced in it.
The thing I do not like about it is that there is no way to boot the system 
with CPU N isolated from the beginning. Also dynamic isolation currently 
relies on the cpu hotplug to clear pending irqs, softirqs, kernel timers and 
threads. So cpusets would have to simulate the cpu hotplug event I guess.

It's still optional. It's the sane default though. I mean users are welcome to 
change affinity mask of an active IRQ.
btw You definitely want to start with that as default for complete isolation, 
because some drivers, E1000 for example, schedule timers and stuff on the CPU 
they handle IRQ on. The timer gets restarted from then on (until iface is 
brought down). Which means that the timer sticks with the CPU even if IRQ is 
moved.
Please do not tell me that I need to fix E1000 instead ;-). It's just an 
example. I'm sure there are other drivers and friends. For the full isolation 
you want to bring the cpu down to get everything off of it and then bring it 
up such that things are not started on it by default. Only then you get a 
truly clean isolated state.

I guess maybe you're not refuting them. But you're not giving me concrete 
examples of how low level stuff would work. Lets talks specifics. I'm not 
stuck on the cpu_isolated_map, if there are better options I'm all for it.
I'm willing to prototype it and see if it works for my usecase. But I need 
more details than "system flag in cpuset".

"Default" affinity was the keyword here. Genirq definitely deals with 
affinities in general. Anyway, as you saw I rewrote it on top of genirq.
Waiting for review feedback from Thomas.

Please be specific. Lets say we get rid of the cpu_isolated_map. How would 
that "system" flag be propagated to the lowest layers like genirq, workqueue, 
etc ?

I think there were other cases besides flushing that wanted all threads to 
report back. But I do not remember exact scenario of the top of my head.

That does not help me because I need full isolation.

I agree in general. From my experience though it is kind of hard and the 
system might be a bit fragile.
Also I can give you another example. In some cases it's preferable if 
workqueues and stuff triggered as the result of the syscalls on the isolated 
cpus ran on the non-isolated cpus. Same for the IRQ. Workqueues are generally 
a background activity. It may make sense to handle IRQ/softirq on the isolated 
CPU and off-load the rest to the non-isoalted one. In which case you'd want 
exactly what my patch does, ie pro-active rerouting of work scheduled on the 
isolated CPU.
To sum it up. Lets talk details.
How the "system" flag you suggested would be propagated to the genirq, 
workqueue, etc ? How do we avoid work being scheduled on those CPUs ?
