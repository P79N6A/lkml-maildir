Subject: question on generating a patch

I read the FAQ and SubmittingPatches, but how best to generate a patch
that moves a file from on dir to another?  diff -urNP makes the patch a
lot longer than it seems like it should be... (fortunately it's just a
short header file)
Is there a better way?
regards,
