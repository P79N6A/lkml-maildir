I think dumping core over a pipe is almost good.  Filtering and writing
out a core by a separete userspace program can be reliable because it is
independent of the failed user process.  But I have one concern; data
transfer over a pipe is slow.  It took 7 seconds to transfer 2GB
anonymous shared memory (detailed at the last of this mail).
In the case of dumping hundreds processes which share giga bytes memory,
it will take a few minutes even if the huge shared memory is not written
to a disk.  If a user wants to restart the failed application as soon
as possible to keep downtime to a minimum, this extra transfer time will
be a barrier.  So I think in-kernel filtering is still needed.
I performed a simple experiment to confirm the transfer speed:
  1. run a program which allocates 2GB anonymous shared memory
  2. the program receives SIGSEGV
  3. core image is generated and passed to tp_pipe(*) over a pipe
  4. tp_pipe reads the pipe and revokes the received data while
     data arrives
  5. tp_pipe logs time of completing the data transfer
  6. repeat 1 to 5 ten times and calculate the average and standard
     deviation
  (*) test program which I prepared for this experiment
Here is the result:
             Average: 7.041 sec
  Standard deviation: 0.903
