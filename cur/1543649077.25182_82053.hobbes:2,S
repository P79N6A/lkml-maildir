Hi,
While transfering a 42MB file, there seem to be a TCP
delay between the kernels 2.4.7 and 2.4.18.
Here are some data :-
In 2.4.7 kernel :
43843584B in 4.486s = 9.77342e+06B/s = 9544.36KB/s =
9.32066MB/s
In 2.4.18 kernel :
 43843584B in 3.711s = 1.18145e+07B/s = 11537.6KB/s =
11.2672MB/s
I am looking at the reason behind the delay in 2.4.7
kernel. Any comments on this?
PS: Please CC me with reply, as i am not subscribed to

thanks,
latha
