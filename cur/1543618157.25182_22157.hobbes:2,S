Lots of patches from people, and some that were dropped because of clashes
(Trond: your NFS directory cache cleanup clashes badly with Al's inode
allocations patches, and I decided to do the more fundamental inode alloc
change first, so ..).
Ingo is waiting for more feedback on the "J4 scheduler", so if people want
to test that out, please do send him feedback. In the meantime, J2 with
all the runqueue fixes is in the standard pre3 kernel.
Basically, the biggest change in pre3 is the one that a lot of people have
been discussing and working on, namely splitting up the inodes so that we
don't need to have the union of every possible filesystem type in "struct
inode" and waste memory.
The inode thing has left umsdos broken, but Al promises to have that fixed
soonish.
