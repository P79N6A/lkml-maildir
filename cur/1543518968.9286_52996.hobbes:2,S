Should I implement an IA32 emulator in the kernel in order to use the
vesafb video driver with my PC card I have on the alpha? Wasn't vesa just
a framebuffer mode that should work all over the place? I don't care about
palette/powersaving and so on. At boot I only want to tell the card
"switch to graphic mode 778 and allow me write my data to the
framebuffer". I can't believe I'll have to write an IA32 emulator into the
kernel to do that (on sane hardware I would achieve the switch with a pair
of writel() in the MMIO I think).
