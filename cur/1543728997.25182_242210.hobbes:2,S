The mlockall issue is still not resolved; however, I did manage to get a
trace, which was probably not possible before because some higher
latency but lower frequency event was overwriting /proc/latency_trace. 
So, maybe mlockall does cause xruns by having many shorter, but long
enough to be problematic, non-preemptible sections.

Also it seems that extract_entropy still causes high latencies, even
though a call to preempt_schedule was added.  I looked at the code in
random.c a bit and this strikes me as an area where the algorithm could
be improved, rather than adding a scheduling point.  Do we really need
*that* much entropy, right then?  And if so, isn't there a zero-copy
solution?
