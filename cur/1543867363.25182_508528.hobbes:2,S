Right.  But that is only because Xen decides to allocate the page from 
the (machine) physical space, rather than from the pseudo-physical 
space.  My question is: why doesn't Xen allocate shared_info from the 
pseudo-physical space?  If it had, then this page wouldn't need to be 
treated specially.  I'm not sure, but I seem to remember on 64-bit 
Xen/XenLinux allocated shared_info from pseudo-physical space already...

I don't really have an objection to stealing a fixmap slot, just seems 
cleaner if you didn't have to special case the shared_info.
