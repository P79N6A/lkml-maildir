Hugh,
Nothing to do with the 'problem' in this thread, but an aside that is perhaps 
relevant.
On my main gateway, I couldn't get any kernel greater than 2.6.4 to run 
without an 'oops' after x amount of time.  It was always swapd or memory oops 
that caused it.
I ran memtest86 a few times with no errors - reaseated everything, new fans 
etc. etc.  No go.
I upgraded memory - all 4 sticks - over Christmas, and after a few weeks 
uptime, tried 2.4.10 again.
I have had no problems since - so perhaps I did have bad memory (it was old).  
But all tests never showed anything untoward.
I was always suspicious why my 2.6.4 build ran OK, but newer builds always 
failed.  Could it be a subtle fault in memory whilst building kernels that 
does it?
Nick
