This is releasepage() not invalidatepage().  It is conditional.
At this point you can't get rid of the page if FS-Cache is still using it
because FS-Cache will call the netfs callback on the page when it has finished.
You also can't cancel the I/O because it may involve a BIO which itself can't
be cancelled.
You may not be able to sleep to wait for FS-Cache to finish because gfp might
not include __GFP_WAIT.
The whole point is to find out whether a page is releasable and recycle it if
it is, not to force it to be released; for that, invalidatepage() exists.
In my opinion, it is better to tell the VM that this page is not currently
available, and let it get on with trying to find one that is rather than
holding up the page allocator until the page becomes available.

Is that stored in the inode?  I don't recall offhand.  It's easy enough to add
if it is.

It calls nfs_clear_inode()...

Okay...  It sounds like I should be able to drop that call there.
Perhaps you should add a comment to that function to note this...

I suppose.  This is a holdover from when I supported R/W inodes too.

Hmmm...  I wonder if I need to do this in nfs_update_inode() at all.  Won't the
pages and the cache object attached to an inode be discarded anyway if the file
attributes returned by the server change?
When can an inode be left with its data attached when modified on the server?
Is this an NFSv4 thing?

Is it possible to make an NFS kernel thread that can have completed nfs_page
structs queued for writing to the cache?

Good point again; for the moment, this can be discarded - though we could do it
for NFS4 under some circumstances, I believe.
