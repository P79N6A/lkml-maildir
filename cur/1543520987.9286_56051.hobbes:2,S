Yes, but your patch adds a third binary structure for shmid_ds:
* before 2.3.1x: int shm_segsz, short pid
* 2.3.36: size_t shm_segsz, short pid
* Chris' patch: size_t shm_segsz, int pid
If Chris' patch gets into 2.4, then "size_t shm_segsz, short pid" is
superflous, and I would prefer if we could drop it before 2.4. If we support
it in 2.4 then we won't be able to drop it during the next 10 years.
