The kernel must know that quota is in use, or it'd be unable to
refuse the syscalls when someone tries to go over his quota.
 From "man mount":
       grpquota / noquota / quota / usrquota
              These  options are accepted but ignored.  (However, quota 
utili‐
              ties may react to such strings in /etc/fstab.)
quota utilities indeed react to such strings in /etc/mtab too.
Qutas aren't actually enabled when the mount options are used,
they are enabled when the "quotaon" tool runs.  I guess it uses
some special syscall or ioctl to really turn quota on.
Doing it at mount time instead, byt actually using those options,
seems saner to me.  But I guess they had their reasons. . .
