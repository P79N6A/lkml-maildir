Both formats are simple.  But cpio is simpler.

Umm.  No.  See initramfs below.  initrds have always been an
evil abomination.  They do things terribly wrong and eliminating
them will _save_ space in embedded linux system.  When busybox is
compiled without the special-case initrd workarounds, it does get
a bit smaller...

Perhaps you have misunderstood.  initramfs is simply an initrd
infrastructure that is done right.  You don't need to use klibc
in your initramfs if you don't want to.  Its just a piece of
normal unhosed-up userspace.  Populate it as you see fit.

Yes he has plenty of experience.  He also has good taste.  IMHO
the embedded world (as well as everyone else) wants initramfs --
it is a major improvement.
