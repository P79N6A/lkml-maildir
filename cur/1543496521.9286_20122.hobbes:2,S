I am running the same test on
1. 2.2.9 + the patch above. It seems ok so far.
2. 2.2.6 + the patch above. I am getting kernel messages:
Attempt to refile free buffer
Attempt to refile free buffer
Attempt to refile free buffer
Attempt to refile free buffer
Attempt to refile free buffer
Attempt to refile free buffer
I will let it run over the weekend.
