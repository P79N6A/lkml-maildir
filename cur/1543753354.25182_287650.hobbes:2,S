These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness. It is 
configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.

This is a maintenance release concentrating on getting a stable and 
hopefully last 2.6.10 release.
A lot of instability manifested by processes stuck in D was caused by 
the early adoption of cfq-timeslices with priority support. This project 
is very exciting, but is not yet suitable for a stable patchset.
Note that gamers are reporting very good audio performance with 
staircase10.3 and higher even on cedega/wineX games.
