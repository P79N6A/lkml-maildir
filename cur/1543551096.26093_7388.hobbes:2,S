The algorithm you posted on the list in this thread will kill init if on 4Mbyte
machine without swap init is large 3 Mbytes and you execute a task that grows
over 1M.
So I repeat again: for correctness you should either fix the oom algorithm and
demonstrate with math that it can't kill init or fix the bug using a magic
check.
Since it's not going to be possible to proof that an oom algorithm won't kill
init (also considering init isn't always /sbin/init) the magic check is going
to be the only bugfix possible.
