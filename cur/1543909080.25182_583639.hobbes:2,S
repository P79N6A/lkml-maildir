Those refers to the files:
	drivers/media/video/video-buf-dvb.c
	drivers/media/video/cx88/cx88-dvb.c
	drivers/media/video/saa7134/saa7134-dvb.c
You should remove those patterns. Those are maintainted together with
VIDEO4LINUX, since they are part of cx88 and saa7134 drivers.
You should also add this entry to DVB:
+F: linux/drivers/media/common/saa7146*.c
Cheers,
Mauro
