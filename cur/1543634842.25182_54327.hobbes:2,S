Can someone tell me what I'm supposed to do to get a compiled in scsi
subsystem to recognize > 8 luns with 2.4.19-pre10-aa4?
I'm going to go to sleep for now, but if anyone can reply with some info
regarding this, I'd greatly appreciate it. I've got a TB size DB to
create tomorrow and I need all my luns. In the -aa kernel I was going to
go into drivers/scsi/hosts.c and modify max_lun = 8 to 16, recompile and
see what that does. If anyone could tell me I'm wrong or what I'd
appreciate that too. Ultimately, I'd like to know if the -aa series even
looks at max_scsi_luns=xxx at boot time at all when CONFIG_SCSI=y. 
Thanks much.
