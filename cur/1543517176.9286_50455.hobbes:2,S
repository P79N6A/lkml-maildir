Thanks. I refinde my search a bit more and with all the info I gathered
I finally figured out a few things. The first is that /dev/zero isn't
what I thought it was. The second is that MAP_SHARED works on files (not
character special, just files). I've not been able get MAP_ANON and 
MAP_SHARE to work. But I've discovered that to avoid bus errors one needs
to open a file that already contains at least the number of bytes you're
going to work with or to create a file and write enough bytes to it to
avoid the bus error.
The solution I've chosen (for now) is mkstemp, unlink, mmap, close and
fork.
I don't like the fact it writes to a file but it at least looks like
variables, I'm used to working with those. I need to get some good books
on Unix programming. The Steven's series is very good but I need further
references. Alternate thinking is always a good thing.
