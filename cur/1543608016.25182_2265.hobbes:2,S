We have almost the same problem, except it totally locks up the
computer. Light network utilization is ok, but heavy traffic does the
effect.
No syslog reports, even keyboards leds won't light up (numlock, etc).
Rebooting helps for a while. We had to install another network card for
a workaround. I've tried kernels 2.4.10 and 2.4.12.
The network card is integrated at the motherboard.

Oh, eepro100-diag reported 'Sleep mode is enabled', which could do
something like this -> I disabled it, but no positive effect.
Any similar problems?
Thanks,
