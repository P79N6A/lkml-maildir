> AFAICT the FullMAC chipsets have reached the END OF LIFE period.
Sorry, as I know (no more details - NDA, sorry) some manufacturers are developing (and planning to continue) FullMAC 802.11g (and further) chipsets and also they are offering Linux drivers (however had no chance to test yet).
But from my point of view, SoftMAC cards are better sometimes - you have more control from drivers and can implement some interesting features (for example, madwifi Linux driver with MAC layer ported from xBSD). 
Any thoughts why we should prefer FullMAC cards over SoftMAC (except CPU usage, of course)?
regards,
