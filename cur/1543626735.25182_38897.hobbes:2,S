Hi, 
Lately I am having kernel panic's, and I have no idea why.. I have not changed anything lately except for regular
software updates. I am using Debian Woody 3.0, packages updated daily, with a 2.4.18 kernel. I have not noticed any
pattern in occurance, the other day it happened just after I dialed my ISP, about 20 minutes ago I was simply using
vim from my windows box via ssh, and just now I had it freeze again after typing `vim .<tab>`..
I also noticed that on reboot, it presents me with "(none) login:" rather than using my hostname of xion as per
usual.. an `ifconfig` shows nothing, ifconfig simply lists lo, and no eth0. Another reboot fixes this. This has only
happened once, I just had another kernel panic and this time on reboot my network is fine, so I am not sure whether
this is related.
These are the messages I see on my terminal, I cannot see any more as this is the highest mode my monitor can support:
-------------------------
<1>Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer deference at virtual address 00000000

(more lines of this, my monitor is almost dead so was hard to read, if it is needed though I can find it out the next
time this problem occurs)
Call Trace: [<c026360e>] [<c0265bd6>] (etc, see above)
Code: Bad EIP value.
 <0>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
-------------------------
I asked around a bit on IRC and it was suggested I try asking here as this seems a kernel related problem. Thanks for
any help you can offer, if any more information about my situation is required let me know.
