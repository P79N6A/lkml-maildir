Well, there is a possible solution at the horizon for a freestanding
environment such as the kernel, -ffreestanding. Currently this just implies
-fno-builtin, i.e. disables builtins that don't begin with __builtin_. But
at the moment does not effect the libcalls the block mover generates. It
would be relatively easy to change gcc to also inhibit those, resulting in
an abort on such structure copies by assignment.
My reasoning would be to use -ffreestanding, as we don't have a standard C
library around and baning all 'struct_a = struct_b' from kernel code,
mandating either the use of struct_cpy() (which would have to be added to all
arcs other than i386) or the direct use of memcpy(), which would then be
inlined via the linux/string.h macro versions.
