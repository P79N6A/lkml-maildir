Just as a detail : LTTng traces NMI, which can happen on top of a
xtime_lock. So yes, I have to consider the impact of this kind of lock when I
choose my time source, which is currently a per architecture TSC read,
or a read of the jiffies counter when the architecture does not have a
synchronised TSC over the CPUs. This is abstracted in include/asm-*/ltt.h.
I know it doesn't support dynamic ticks, I'm working on using the HRtimers
instead, but I must make sure that the seqlock read will fail if it nests over
a write seqlock.
