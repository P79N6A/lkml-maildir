Yes, I'm fully aware of the size of OpenOffice.  So far I've had at least
a dozen people who apparently didn't pick up on the sarcasm without a smiley.
Now to tie it back to another thread - the OpenOffice is just so honking HUGE
that a good case could be made that the source tarball is not the preferred
form for making modifications, because that sucker *has* to be in an IDE for
you to be able to find what it is you wanted to modify. ;)
(And guys? There's a smiley on that this time...)
