It's possible, but I doubt it.  More often than not, the reboot happens
when the machine is completely idle - in fact I can't remember a single
time when it wasn't idle.  I just spent a couple months debugging a
SCSI-tape crash, and I ran the backups a lot and had lots of RAID
resyncs and it *never* rebooted during either of these events.  Anyway
it has quite a large 2+1 redundant power supply, and, like I said, we
routinely had 3+ months of uptime with older kernels.
During the years I've had this machine, I've experienced at least 10-15
strange kernel bugs that only happened on this machine.  Each and every
time I was *convinced* that the hardware was at fault (and people on the
mailing list suggested it) until either a kernel came out that fixed the
problem or a kernel developer positively identified it as a kernel
problem and eventually fixed it.  This machine just seems to be a magnet
for kernel bugs.
Thanks,
