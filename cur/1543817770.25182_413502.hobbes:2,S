sata_mv seems to just use the default libata shutdown sequence,
so perhaps it's leaving the device in EDMA mode with interrupt
coalescing still on (from the BIOS), and interrupts are still
coming in or something..
I suppose it really ought to shut down the device before exiting,
and maybe the default of pci_disable_device() is not enough.. ?
Cheers
