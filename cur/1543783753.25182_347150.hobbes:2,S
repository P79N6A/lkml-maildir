Hello again,
Got some more info that may be of value here. After I saw gcc coredump 
on me with 2.6.13 I tried halting my system and I saw a kernel panic 
while shutting down. The stack trace it showed me was:
   flush_tlb_mm+201
   exit_mmap+249
   mmput+49
   do_exit+434
   sys_reboot+264
   __group_send_sig_info+184
   group_send_info+118
   thread_return
   thread_return+82
   filp_close+110
   system_call+126
All typed down by hand since it never made it into a log, so there can 
be omissions and typos in there (and I didn't feel like typing down all 
those 64-bit hex numbers, sorry).
