This one came in through my scsi tree.  How about we fix the issue in a 
different way:  I can add an option in SCSI to check for the new eh methods 
and if it doesn't find any at all, panic the system saying that this driver 
has no error handling but if you reboot with the scsi_no_error_handling option 
it won't panic again?
