This is a privileged operation, which currently relies only on uid (i.e. 
traditional Unix DAC), and capability checking.
SELinux introduces Mandatory Access Control (MAC) based upon all 
security-relevant attributes of tasks and objects, not just uid/capability 
checks.  Theoretically, all processes could run with euid==0 under SELinux 
(in fact, Russell Coker's 'play box' does something similar by giving out 
the root password to everyone, although SELinux is designed to complement 
DAC, not replace it).
Any privileged operations with DAC controls also need corresponding MAC 
controls, which is what this patch implements.
