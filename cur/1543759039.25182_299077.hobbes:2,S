Yes. I think people will have to be taught, and get used to the new world
order, and that could take a long time. And don't get me wrong, I include
myself in those people, ie it's not just that everybody else needs to
learn to Cc: the new group (I assume it's best to have a mailing alias, to
allow the thing to have multiple people involved even before it gets to
the vetting stage, and then have a _separate_ mail alias for the "vettign
group" people).
Think of how the -mm tree has evolved - with me and Andrew learning how 
the other side acts and works. This would be the same thing, except 
hopefully on a smaller scale (ie the _volume_ of patches had better be an 
order of magnited smaller not just in size but in number too). It wasn't 
just "let's set up Andrew". It was a learning experience.
And yes, we'll probably get duplicated changes, _especially_ early on. But 
at least nobody seems to hate this idea, so I think we should drop the 
original even/odd suggestion for now, and see if this would make more 
sense..
