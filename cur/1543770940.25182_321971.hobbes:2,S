I believe it is still a problem: primarily because it broke
old behavior for no apparent reason (Stephen Rothwell, who was 
one of the original implementers seems to agree, since he 
suggested that one line patch).  I suspect the change was 
unintentional.
By the way, I wrote the text in the fcntl() man page
by looking at the code and experimenting.  There was no 
existing documentation of F_SETLEASE.  I'm questioning 
the change based on my understanding of how things should 
work (I didn't happen to write up this point because it 
seemed self-evident *to me*); however, I know rather 
little of the workings of SAMBA.
Cheers,
Michael
