eh? I don't see how that matters at all. After the DMA transfer, all the 
cache lines will have to be invalidated in every CPUs cache anyway, so
it's guaranteed to be stone-dead zero-degrees-kelvin cold. I don't see how
however hot it becomes afterwards is relevant?

If the DMA is to pages that are hot in the CPUs cache - it's WORSE ... we
have more work to do in terms of cacheline invalidates. Mmm ... in terms
of DMAs, we're talking about disk reads (ie a new page allocates) - we're
both on the same page there, right?
