GCC does optimise away multiple header file inclusion, and has done
for a very long time, oh a decade or so :)
GCC will not reparse a header file if these conditions are met:
	1. The file has already been parsed at least once.
	2. Apart from comments, the entire file is surrounded by
	   "#ifndef symbol ... #endif" or "#if !defined (symbol) ... #endif".
	3. "symbol" is defined.
	4. The file names are the same after removal of "." and ".." components
	   and other path simplifications.

You can also use the "-H" option and check for a "Multiple include
guards may be useful for:" message, to check those #ifndefs.
