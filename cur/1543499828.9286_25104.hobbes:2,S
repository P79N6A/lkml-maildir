You are *completely* wrong here. You can report status just fine with
static pages, I expect youve never actually tried this or you wouldnt
have said it.

A very, very, very minimal userspace web server that does CGI and nothing
else.

Bzzt game over thanks for playing.

in-kernel khttpd will likely be smaller than userspace one since
kernelspace one doesnt need libc and other overhead.

There is a reason but thats not one of them
