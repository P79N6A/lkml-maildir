	Agreed, this can be a problem, hence my thoughts on a set of /dev
files that reside on the filesystem pointing to /devices, which can be
thought of as basically the same thing as major,minor pairs, w/ the
exception that they are names (And as such much more scalable, and often
easier to understand).  Unfortunately, I don't know enough about how
devices work to know if something like this is even possible.
	I suppose you could take away /devices and change whatever you have
to to make major,minor pairs names instead...  Then have a userspace daemon
that can do what it wants to the files, or they can be modified by hand.
Of course, this looses us the (debated) advantage of having /dev being in
memory instead of on disk.
	Then I ask you, how can a script find out specific information
about what hardware exists on the system?  Run through everything in /dev?
If /dev is fully populated, this could take a while...  /proc gives us
some data currently, though it's not in a very standard fashion, and
currently would be hard for a script or program to parse out.
	Curious, what are your feelings on /proc, anyhow?
