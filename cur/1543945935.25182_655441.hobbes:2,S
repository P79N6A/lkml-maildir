Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
The tree is now tagged with a tag like next-YYYYMMDD and has a
localversion-next file which adds "-next-YYYYMMDD" to the kernel revision.
There were a couple of merge conflicts and a couple of build failures and
the appropriate people contacted.
We are up to 24 trees, more are welcome.
