It should just do:
	modprobe -q ehci-hcd >/dev/null 2>&1
	modprobe -q ohci-hcd >/dev/null 2>&1
	modprobe -q uhci-hcd >/dev/null 2>&1
That's what the latest hotplug package has in it.  I don't know what
Debian has lately...

Here's a patch that I always run with.  It is pretty verbose, but helps
me out a lot in debugging and development.
Let us know if it shows anything interesting.
