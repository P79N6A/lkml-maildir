Not enough numbers. Not even in a 32:32 major:minor split.

Surely, you don't want to miss them. Yet there are cases you are screwed.
Look at the hotplug spawning code and you'll see that it takes only one
kmalloc failling.

That's exactly what you need to do. You can do this, if you change
the hotplugging notification to a pure pipe thing and lock the demon
into memory.  But then you have no advantage freom doing it in user
space, in fact you'll have the overhead of page tables for no benefit.

Yes, in my oppinion putting such things into user space is stupid.
Your considerable talents would be better used to help Adam getting
his simplified devfs ready.

Your attitude is admirably relaxed :-)

Then you fail. Security without guarantee is no security.

Walking sysfs is a race condition by itself.
Don't get me started on that.
