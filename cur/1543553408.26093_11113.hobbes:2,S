Actually, if you would look in linux/fs, you will see that ext3 IS in
linux/fs/ext3.  However, there is a second component to ext3, which is
a generic block journalling layer which is called jfs.  This journal
layer is designed so that it isn't ext3 specific, so it would be
_possible_ for other journalling filesystems to use it.  Whether non-ext3
filesystems will actually use it is another question (actually the
InterMezzo distributed filesystem uses the ext3-jfs functionality to
do compound transactions on disk to ensure cluster coherency).
I think that Stephen at one time said he would change the name, but I
guess he has not done so yet.
Cheers, Andreas
