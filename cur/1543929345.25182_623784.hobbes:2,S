No, no, I don't think this should be pushed into 2.6.24 (even the first patch).
These problems are very old afaics, and nobody complained so far.
Even if correct, this needs more testing. I don't think this can break exec
or coredump in some "obvious" way, but I'm afraid this can introduce new
races / corner cases.

I hope that with the new meaning of ->group_exit_task we can re-introduce the
"coredump signal "freezes" the thread group at sender's side" property, but we
need some hack to do this. OTOH, it was always a hack.
