nanonit: please prepare titles in the form "subsystem-id:
what-i-did-to-it", so a suitable name here would be
	epoll: drop max_user_instances and rely only on max_user_watches

A reader of this changelog would be wondering what this DoS is.

So the max consumable memory is
	number-of-users * max_user_watches * sizeof(whatever)
?
So if enough users gang up (or if one person has access to a lot of
UIDs), there's still a DoS?
I suspect we can live with that.
I assume that because you based all this on all the other patches, you
view it as 2.6.30 material?

please use `diff -p'.  It helps.

I hit a reject here (which is actually in epoll_create1()) (and diff -p
might not have told us of this, because of that darned
SYSCALL_DEFINE1() thing we just added) (which broke ctags too).
The code I have is
	if (error < 0)
		ep_free(ep);
	else
		atomic_inc(&ep->user->epoll_devs);
so I obviously nuked the `else' as well.
