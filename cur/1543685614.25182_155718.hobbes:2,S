I'll send a
  default INPUT && INPUT_KEYBOARD && SERIO
patch (to address the things James said, in any cases it doesn't do any 
harm).
But it stays strange that a default can assign a value that isn't 
allowed by the depends, and you therefore have to write the depends 
twice in this case:
config KEYBOARD_ATKBD
        tristate "AT keyboard support" if EMBEDDED || !X86 
        default INPUT && INPUT_KEYBOARD && SERIO
        depends on INPUT && INPUT_KEYBOARD && SERIO

On a first thought I'd have expected it to be equivalent to
  default y if BAR=y
