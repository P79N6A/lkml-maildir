Well, you need the source for the kernel you're building the module for,
it needs to be configured and "make dep" must have been run (for module 
versions).
(You normally can find it by looking into /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel 
for the currently running kernel)
Put your module source in some directory, and add a Makefile like
	obj-m := my_module.o
	include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make
cd into the kernel source and run
	make SUBDIRS=/path/to/your/module modules
