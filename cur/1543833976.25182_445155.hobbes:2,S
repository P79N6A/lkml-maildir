AFAIC the /proc method of controlling seccomp is so ugly it should
just go, but what about backwards compatibility?
I have a couple of questions:
+void disable_TSC(void)
+{
+       if (!test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_NOTSC))
+               /*
+                * Must flip the CPU state synchronously with
+                * TIF_NOTSC in the current running context.
+                */
+               hard_disable_TSC();
+}
This gets called from sys_prctl().  Do you need to worry about preemption
between the test_and_set and TSC disable?

Maybe these should be inline?  They're really small and that way you
don't need #ifdef around the code for them.

For x86_64 you need this:
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt-current/patches/tif-flags-for-debug-regs-and-io-bitmap-in-ctxsw
But I don't think Andi plans on pushing it for 2.6.18.
