It does in some ways anyhow.  Following things downstream is rather
painless, but one of the things we in the PPC tree hit alot is when we
have a new file in one of the sub trees and want to move it up to the
'stable' tree, or when it shows up in your/marcelo's tree.  bk send only
works for same base tree type things (ie a clone of tree X, some
changes, not a clone of tree Y, which was a clone of tree X but has lots
of changes and has tree X changes pulled in frequently).  Unfortunaly I
don't think this is an easy problem to work on either.
