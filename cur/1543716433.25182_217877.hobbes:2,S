Wow! I, actually, thought about it, but I didn't expect it to work right
now, I would expect the umount to fail with EBUSY... But it does work!
Guys, it rocks! The only slight inconvenience - mount still shows
/tmp/blah/relative_path /desired_mountpoint (bind)
which is not necessarily informative. A better display would be, perhaps
<whatever>:relative_path /desired_mountpoint (bind)
in /proc/mounts also not quite true:
<whatever> /desired_mountpoint
One might want to improve those...
Thanks
