I don't really think the original thought matters.  What matters is that
the behavior is 
a) non-obvious - you don't expect it
b) undetectable - you can't find out which alias is "primary"
c) inconsistent - some aliases act differently that other aliases
All of these violate the principle of least surprise.  Whether it was
intentional or not, it behaves like a nasty hack, or worse, a bug.  It is
easily fixed, and should be.

Why should user-land be forced to work around what is obviously (to the
vast majority of people in this discussion) a mis-feature?
