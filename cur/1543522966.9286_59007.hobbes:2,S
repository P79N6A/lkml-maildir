Well, certainly the linux kernel as a whole is tightly bound to gcc
at the moment. But I can imagine lots of reasons why we wouldn't want
to be gratuitously non-portable:
* people may want to extract parts of the kernel to reuse them in
 other environments, with other compilers
* people may want to port the kernel to an (existing or future) architecture
 where gcc is not ported, or produces code much inferior to other compilers.
* people may want to feed kernel sources into automatic software analysis
 and transformation tools that only understand plain C, and not GNU C
 extensions.
* who knows? many other reasons.
Anyway, in such cases as this one where a satisfying patch is available,
it costs more to argue about the issue than to apply the patch. Doesn't it?
PS: if Alan, Linus, or another maintainer includes my clean-up patch
in next official (after testing it on variously-endianned architectures),
I'll be glad.
