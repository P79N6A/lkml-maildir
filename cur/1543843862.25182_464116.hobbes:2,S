The x86-64 timer subsystems currently doesn't have clocksources
at all, but it supports TSC and some other timers.

You can use that, but it will make your system run quite hot 
and cost you a lot of powe^wmoney.

Yes.  Good point. DHCP is broken and needs to be fixed. Can you
send a bug report to the DHCP maintainers? 
iirc the problem used to be that RAW sockets didn't do something
they need them to do. Maybe we can fix that now.
If that's not possible we can probably add a ioctl or similar
to disable time stamping for packet sockets (DHCP shouldn't really
need a fine grained time stamp). dhcpcd would need to use that then.
Keep me updated what they say.
