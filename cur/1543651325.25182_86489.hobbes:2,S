Ah.  I see.

Having a less-than-expected amount to copy sounds like it can
be safely handled?

There are two queues per cpu.  cache-warm pages and cache-cold
pages.  The cold queue is mainly for lock amortisation, to avoid
taking the zone lock once per page.  But we can also allocate
from the cold queue for situations where we'll be invalidating the
cache anyway (file readahead).  We don't want to waste cache-hot
pages.  Your change breaks that.
