Is anyone having kernel lock ups using 'Arkeia backup' with kernel
v2.4.18?
Network backups start out fine, however cause the kernel to lock up
half way through.  I read that v2.2.16 solved problems for the
v2.2.x series kernel, but haven't read anything on v2.4.x.
Were there any big changes in memory management between v2.2 and v2.2?
Thanks
