Hey again,
Having some difficulties with a newer kernel this time.  We upgraded a
perfectly working machine here in our office from 2.0.37-ac5 to 2.2.3-ac1
after applying the applicable redhat RPM's for 2.2.
Thirty minutes after we rebooted we got a huge bunch of messages that
started
with this:
Mar 16 08:06:12 rocky kernel: ks not in datazone - block = 993276251,
count = 1
Mar 16 08:06:12 rocky kernel: EXT2-fs error (device 08:05):
ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 1699956790,
count = 1
.
. 286 more just like the last, each with different block
.  numbers but all time stamped at 08:06:12
We are using a DPT 3334UW controller with a raid 1 array of two 9 GB
disks.  It's a compaq proliant 1600.  I can send more output of fdisk or
other commands if anyone thinks it might be relevant.  
We haven't seen any messages since and everything seems to be working
fine.  Should I be worried?
