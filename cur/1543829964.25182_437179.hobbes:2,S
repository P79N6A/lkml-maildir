yes, this does legitimise the `crashboot' option.
That being said, it's misnamed, I think.  It should be called
`reset_devices' or something.  Because that's what it does, and who
knows, there might be other reasons for wanting to reset devices.
See, it's more accurate.  We don't want drivers to be looking at some
global environmental thing and then independently working out what they
should be doing this time around.  We just want drivers to do what they're
told.
