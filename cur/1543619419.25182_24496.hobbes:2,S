 Possibly an issue with preempt on top of my tree. Builds fine UP & SMP
 here without it.

 Can you send the gcc error messages of these ?
 (A patch would be nice too)

 Could be related to the usb-driverfs changes, 2.5.3-dj1 is still cooking

 The ext3 related oops, hmm. Oopsing in generic_file_write seems odd.
 I'm wondering if the system was in such a state at this point that the
 subsequent oopses are just noise.

 an answer for this.
