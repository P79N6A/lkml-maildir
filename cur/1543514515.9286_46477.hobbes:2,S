And I should have mentioned, even if DTFS was usable right now,
it doesn't de-allocate blocks, and is still in need of an fs
cleaner.
Log strustured filesystems (as discussed previously on l-k) have
performance issues due to the "append" rather than "modify in place"
nature in which writes happen.
The benefit comes in things like snapshots, where you can preserve
metadata at some point in time, basically having a readonly copy
of the whole FS from time HH:SS.
They are interesting, though! I hope some people get interested
and help out.

Yes, but dtfs is not strictly the same thing -- it is log structured,
not journaled.  I also haven't seen any activity on it in months.
