Subject: 2.6.24 regression: Wake On Lan in sky2 broken on Mac mini

Hi folks,
with 2.6.24-rc8, Wake On LAN doesn't work anymore as it used to with
2.6.23 on my Mac mini Core Duo. I saw that this was reported in
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9721
 and on netdev a patch
for the sky2 driver was sent by Stephen Hemminger. This patch fixed WOL
for me after applying it to 2.6.24-rc8.
However, it seems as the patch never made it into the kernel. Instead,
the commit that was suspected to break WOL
(84cd2dfb04d23a961c5f537baa243fa54d0987ac) was reverted
(be63a21c9573fbf88106ff0f030da5974551257b).
Now I tried the 2.6.24 release and noticed that WOL is still broken.
I'll be happy to test any patches that can make it into 2.6.24.1.
Regards,
Tino
