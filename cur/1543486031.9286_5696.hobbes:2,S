Greetings,
I have a 2.0.3X system with 174 days of uptime (yeay!).  I brought it to
single-user mode to fsck some partitions, but somehow (I'm guessing the
automounter on it) nfsiod died in the process.  The system is still running
and can NFS mount/be mounted without apparent illness.  However, this
disturbs me:
root         4  0.0  0.0     0     0  ?  Z  Aug 25   0:49 (nfsiod <zombie>)
root         5  0.0  0.0     0     0  ?  Z  Aug 25   0:45 (nfsiod <zombie>)
root         6  0.0  0.0     0     0  ?  Z  Aug 25   0:48 (nfsiod <zombie>)
root         7  0.0  0.0     0     0  ?  Z  Aug 25   0:46 (nfsiod <zombie>)
Should I reboot this system once and for all?
thanks,
-bp
