Hello,
I'm  running 2.6.0-test1-ac3  on my  sis-based laptop,  and  I've some
problems with  the sis  900 networking card:  in a  low-bandwith usage
(like a ssh to another computer,  or a copy from another computer with
a 10Mbps card), I get some network freezes, and after a few seconds it
starts again (with the following messages in the syslog):
Aug  3 11:55:13 kesto kernel: eth0: Media Link Off
Aug  3 11:55:22 kesto kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Aug  3 11:55:22 kesto kernel: eth0: Transmit timeout, status 00000004 00000000 
Aug  3 11:55:23 kesto kernel: eth0: Media Link On 100mbps full-duplex 
When I  copy files  to another 100  Mbps laptop (with  a cross-cable),
after a short while the network  stops completly to work, and I cannot
even rmmod sis900 (device or ressource busy).
If you want the /proc/pci entry for the network card:
  Bus  0, device   1, function  1:
    Ethernet controller: Silicon Integrated S SiS900 10/100 Ethern (rev 130).
      IRQ 10.
      Master Capable.  Latency=128.  Min Gnt=52.Max Lat=11.
      I/O at 0x3200 [0x32ff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x44000000 [0x44000fff].
I've enabled preempt and local  APIC in my kernel configuration, but I
used to patch my 2.4 kernels  with preempt before switching to 2.6 and
I never had any network-related problem.
As a side-node,  I can tell you  that when we (a friend  and I) ported
the sis900  driver to GNU Mach,  we had to  add a delay loop  (I know,
it's ugly, but it's just a quick-and-dirty patch while waiting for the
OSKit-based GNU Mach) in the sis900_start_xmit function. With no delay
at  all  the  driver  stopped  to  work  after  one  packet  has  been
transmitted, with  a small delay  it worked for  low-bandwidth program
(say, a "ping 192.168.1.1") but not for a file transfert, I had to add
a bigger one to make it work fine.
I'm available if you need additional informations.
