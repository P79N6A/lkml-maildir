Check your /proc/slabinfo, just in case, to rule out a leak.

This is not interesting. Get it _after_ the box becomes sluggish.
Remember, the 2.4.18 stream in RH does not have its own VM, distinct
from Marcelo+Riel. So, you can come to linux-kernel for advice,
but first, get it all reproduced with Marcelo's tree with
Riel's patches all the same.
