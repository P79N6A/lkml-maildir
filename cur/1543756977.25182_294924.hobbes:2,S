Nope. No printk outputs from _set_par, _write_mode, or _engine_init.
Just to clarify: the gdm stop is done from tty1 while gdm is running
on tty7, so I don't think it's a matter of mode switch logic.
If I do "sleep 5; /etc/init.d/gdm stop" and then switch to tty7 and
wait for it to stop, all is fine.
Also, I'm still seeing the LCD blooming + hang on starting radeonfb.
It's something like 1 in 10 boots rather than every boot now though.
