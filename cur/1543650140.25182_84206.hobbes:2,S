   The following patch deals with the problems you still had with the earlier one.
   Changes:
   1. add #if defined(CONFIG_BRIDGE) || defined(CONFIG_BRIDGE_MODULE) everywhere
   2. don't touch ip_tables.c
   3. no ipt_physdev.c file yet. I'll try to make it this weekend.
   
I've applied this to my tree, thanks.
