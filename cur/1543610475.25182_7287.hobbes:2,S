Well, just wanted to tell you that 2.4.15 still slows down to a crawl when
copying a 500MB file between two hard drives (running ext3). I have tried
any of the -c -u -m -W settings in hdparm. I even applied the 2.4.14 IDE
patch (after fixing the rejects) but no go.
Even iptables is affected, because it takes forever to surf the internet
from my behind-linux-firewall windows computer.
I'm right now trying to apply the preemptive-kernel patch to 2.4.15 but it
had some strange rejects so it will be exciting to see if it works. I get
good response from the -ac kernel series though.
