        This is for OPL3 OSS emulation. With your patch applied to 2.5.15, 
opl3_oss.c was not compiled at all, whether into the kernel, or as a module. 
Also, your patch for include/sound/opl3.h did not need to be applied as the 
#ifdef CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL and #endif lines are already present sound the two 
variables listed.
                                                        BL.
