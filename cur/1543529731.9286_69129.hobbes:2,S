You'll need to change your LILO for one without EBDA patch (or with
correct EBDA patch, if such exist). There are LILOs with some distributions,
which limit kernel commandline to 64 (or 80?) bytes. Try
cat /proc/cmdline (or wc /proc/cmdline). If you'll get
BOOT_IMAGE=Linux ro root=302 ramdisk=0 BOOT_FILE=/boot/vmlinuz devfs=nomount
video=matrox:vesa:0x105 video=matrox:dev:1 pciorder=1:00.0,0:0b.0,0:0a.0
then it is ok. If your cmdline contains only 80 bytes and is cut in the
middle, you have problem.
