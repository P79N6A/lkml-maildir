When I run two processes with policy SCHED_RR and at same priority the
processes do not swap in round robin fashion. The first process to get the
processor runs to completion. I do confirm that the policy and prioritys are
in fact set. Whats wrong with the equation? I've testing using a REDHAT 6.0
installation with kernels 2.3.11 and 2.2.12 and gcc version egcs-2.91.66.
Also, when ever I try pthread_create I error with "ANSI C++ forbids implicit
conversion from void * in arguement passing". But, I'm following the
interface in thread.h. What am I doing wrong?
