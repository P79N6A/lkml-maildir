Unfortunately this isn't over yet.
I got suspicious about this bug fix, because I *did* test my patch before 
submitting it and the kernel that didn't work before, worked fine with my patch.
But now it seems that it is the other way around. After a few digging I found 
out the problem:
The application that I was testing with uses the usblp handle with non-blocking 
I/O .
So my patch does work for non-blocking I/O uses of the port, but wrecks the 
normal blocking mode.
I've already produced a version that works for both cases. I'll just clean it up 
a bit and submit it to 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
