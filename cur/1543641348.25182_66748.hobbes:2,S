Subject: [Patch 6/8] 2.4.20-pre4/ext3: Performance fix for O_SYNC behaviour
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Remove the unconditional mark_inode_dirty() which was being done on O_SYNC
inodes, as that is a major performance hit if we are updating files in place
and don't need an inode timestamp update to hit the journal (Linux really
implements O_DATASYNC instead of O_SYNC).
Cater for the data=journal case by forcing a commit after the write if needed;
also do this for IS_SYNC() case.  (Simply setting the inode dirty before the
write is not sufficient in the data=journal case --- the write might get split
over multiple transactions and there is no guarantee that later transactions
would get flushed.)
Add a bit of documentation around the ext3_file_write --- the interactions
between the various sync modes and the core VFS (especially
generic_osync_inode) are subtle.
