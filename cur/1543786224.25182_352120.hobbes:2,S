Subject: [PATCH 6/7] update stale comment for removal of page->list
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Update comment for the 2.6.6-rc1 conversion from page->list and
address_space->{clean,dirty,locked}_pages to radix tree tagging and ->lru.
I've mostly avoided to mention page lists (at least I've shortened the
comment).
