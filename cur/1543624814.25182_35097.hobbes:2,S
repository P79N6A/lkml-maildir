Try latest ac kernel or my patches

(stock kernel doesn't have correct timings yet).
Look at your board revision too. I had a k7s5al (k7s5a + lan) rev 4+ which did corrupt
data. The new one I own is a rev 7 and doesn't exhibit a single problem.
You can find the revision black printed on a white sticker near the last PCI slot
(the one farest from the AGP one).
If you still have data corruption with latest ac kernel or with my
latest patch applied you definitely have a faulty board.
