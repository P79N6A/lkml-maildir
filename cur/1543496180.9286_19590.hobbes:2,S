Greetings.
It would appear that if you attempt to open /dev/psaux twice, the kernel
will very messily panic.  Unfortunately, I cannot provide you with an Oops
- it seems the kernel was mutilating itself to the point where it was
causing a hard reset.
I discovered this while trying to apt-get upgrade my system, and only when
gpm was the only package left to upgrade (while X/xdm was running) did the
system crash in such a way that I could observe it being gpm's fault.
