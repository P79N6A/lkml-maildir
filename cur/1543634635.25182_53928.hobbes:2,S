My plan is to convert the current configuration into a new format (I have
a tool for that), which is more flexible and will allow that all needed
information to configure/build a driver is at a single place. It currently
looks like this:
config BLK_DEV_SD
  depends SCSI
  tristate "SCSI disk support"
  help
  If you want to use a SCSI hard disk ...
More information can be added later to this.
The current parsers will all be replaced with a single parser, actually
it's a library that does all the work and which allows multiple front
ends to behave identical.
bye, Roman
