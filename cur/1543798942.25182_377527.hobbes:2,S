Well, my metrics show the worst non-recursive paths and recursions
only.  The case at hand is a relatively innocent path on its own, but
is stacked on top of one of the recursions.
Therefore, if my tool could make more sense of recursions and f.e. see
that raid over raid is unlikely, but nfsd over xfs over raid over
block is likely, nfsd would definitely show up.  Recursions are the
hard problem to worry about.
Don't blame Neil for my tool being stupid. :)
