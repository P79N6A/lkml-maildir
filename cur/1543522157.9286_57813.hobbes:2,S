Don't worry Jakub - it is not my habit to break programs.
Clearly, getpagesize() is more reliable in general, because
it reflects the current system, rather than the system the
binary was compiled on. On the other hand, I quoted the libc code
(left it in so that you can look at it again) - this libc code
does not invoke the system call at all, and returns the wrong result.
The goal of util-linux is to work with all kernels, all libcs, all
architectures. So saying that glibc 2.1 does not have this problem
doesnt help - the problem exists already and mkswap has to deal
with it.
# uname -a
Linux klaus 2.0.30 #1 Tue Apr 22 11:32:12 EDT 1997 sparc unknown
# ./mkswap -V
mkswap from util-linux-2.10e
# ./mkswap /dev/foo
Assuming pages of size 8192 (not 4096)
# swapon /dev/foo
swapon: /dev/foo: Invalid argument
# ./mkswap -p65536 /dev/foo
Using user-specified page size 65536, instead of the system values 8192/4096
# ./mkswap -p4096 /dev/foo
# swapon /dev/foo
#
In other words, the present state of affairs is: (i) mkswap uses
the result of getpagesize(), (ii) when that is not the same as
PAGE_SIZE it warns the user what size page it is using, (iii) there
is a new -p option that allows the user to specify a page size.
On this machine for example, getpagesize() returns 8192 but the
page size is 4096, so that a swap space made without option fails.
Of course it is a pity that we have to introduce a new option,
but it is superfluous for new installations with a good libc.
In the general case I see no clean way to avoid it.
(And that such contortions are necessary shows how unfortunate
our swap space design is.)

MKSWAP(8)           Linux Programmer's Manual           MKSWAP(8)
NAME
       mkswap - set up a Linux swap area
SYNOPSIS
       mkswap [-c] [-vN] [-f] [-p PSZ] device [size]
...
       The  PSZ  parameter  specifies the page size to use. It is
       almost always unnecessary (even unwise) to specify it, but
       certain  old  libc versions lie about the page size, so it
       is possible that mkswap gets it wrong. The symptom is that
       a  subsequent  swapon  fails  because no swap signature is
       found. Typical values for PSZ are 4096 or 8192.
