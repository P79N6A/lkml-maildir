if you have someone using root that shouldn't be (hacker, whatever) then
how they got root and preventing them from getting root should be your
first priority.
if you are root validly, and you do this, then it's either
A) your fault for not knowing how to program correctly (if you know how to
do ioctl's of this sort, you're not a "joe six pack" root, and it's not
dummy proofing) (like someone mentioned with the X clock lines)
B) the hardware's fault for letting you fuck it up.
it's not the kernel's job to babysit your bad/incorrect programming.
how about this comparison. your car can do 120mph. you get a speeding
ticket doing 90mph. are you gonna blame the car company because they let
your engine run that fast? No. It's not a mediator. You're expected to
know right and wrong. If you accept the job of root, same thing, you're
expected to know the right and wrong, expected to take responsibility for
deleting a file incorrectly, bad programming, etc..
