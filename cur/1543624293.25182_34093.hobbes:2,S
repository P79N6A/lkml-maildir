One sticking point seems to be the question of whether there needs to be 
some amount of validation performed on the commands passed through the 
taskfile interface.  I don't think Andre buys into the argument that 
most other kernel hackers understand, which is, "if userspace is allowed 
to bang away at random i/o ports, why validate taskfile  requests in the 
kernel?"
And IMO, we should have some basic validation of taskfile requests in 
the kernel...
Reason 1: Standard kernel convention.  In other ioctls, we check basic 
arguments and return EINVAL when they are wrong, even for privieleged 
ioctls.
Reason 2: If you have multiple programs issuing ATA commands, you would 
want a decent amount of synchronization, provided by the kernel, for the 
multiple user processes and multiple kernel processes issuing requests. 
 Having the userspace commands come down a single spot in the kernel 
code makes this job a lot easier, if not making the impossible possible :)
