We take the BKL, yes; but if we need to sleep waiting for a block to
be read in, that's when another process can run.  Yes, that means
another process could end up deleting the entry out from under us ---
or make some other change to the directory.  I was actually quite
nervous about this, so I spent some time auditing the code paths of
when do_split() might sleep, to make sure it would never leave the
directory in an unstable condition.
Things will actually get easier once we fine-grain lock ext3 (and
remove the BKL), since we'll very likely end up locking the directory
during an insert, rename, or delete, and so we don't have to worry
about things happening in an interleaved fashion.

Yup, that's going to Linus as well.

I wasn't able to find your e-mail address in the source file.... 
grep -i chrisl fs/ext3/*.c didn't turn up anything?
