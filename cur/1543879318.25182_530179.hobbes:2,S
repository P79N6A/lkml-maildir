They may even report that the current behavior of not knowing anything about
double-width characters is wrong. If Unicode is updated and someone reports
the kernel code is outdated, it's going to be fairly easy to update that one
as well.
I still can't see why my proposed version is by any means worse than the
current one. (I can see however that my version is still not perfect.)

Nice idea. Terminfo database should tell whether a particular terminal
supports double-width characters. Applications should expect the cursor to
move one or two cells depending on this. So both terminfo databases as well
as plenty of libraries and applications would need update. I'll ask Thomas
E. Dickey for his opinion.
