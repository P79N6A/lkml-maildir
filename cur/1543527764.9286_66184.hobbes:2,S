From my personal experience it works for copying one file on top of
another but the rm command doesn't work (you get unlink errors and the
file is still there afterwards). - It works well enough to fix a
broken-device-driver-associated bootup BSOD on winNT anyway!
However a subsequent chkdsk in NT revealed a few errors which got fixed so
I wouldn't trust the driver as far as I can throw it... (-;
Just my 2p.
