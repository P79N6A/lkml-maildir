Subject: [PATCH 002 of 5] md: 'sync_action' in sysfs returns wrong value for readonly arrays
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/15/7

When an array is started read-only, MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED can be set but
no recovery will be running.  This causes 'sync_action' to report the
wrong value.
We could remove the test for MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED, but doing so would
leave a small gap after requesting a sync action, where 'sync_action'
would still report the old value.
So make sure that for a read-only array, 'sync_action' always returns 'idle'.
