Subject: [PATCH 24/27] r-o-bind-mounts-track-number-of-mount-writers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is the real meat of the entire series.  It actually implements the
tracking of the number of writers to a mount.  However, it causes scalability
problems because there can be hundreds of cpus doing open()/close() on files
on the same mnt at the same time.  Even an atomic_t in the mnt has massive
scalaing problems because the cacheline gets so terribly contended.
This uses a statically-allocated percpu variable.  All operations are local to
a cpu as long that cpu operates on the same mount, and there are no writer
count imbalances.  Writer count imbalances happen when a write is taken on one
cpu, and released on another, like when an open/close pair is performed on two
Upon a remount,ro request, all of the data from the percpu variables is
collected (expensive, but very rare) and we determine if there are any
outstanding writers to the mount.
I've written a little benchmark to sit in a loop for a couple of seconds in
several cpus in parallel doing open/write/close loops.
http://sr71.net/~dave/linux/openbench.c
The code in here is a a worst-possible case for this patch.  It does opens on
a _pair_ of files in two different mounts in parallel.  This should cause my
code to lose its "operate on the same mount" optimization completely.  This
worst-case scenario causes a 3% degredation in the benchmark.
I could probably get rid of even this 3%, but it would be more complex than
what I have here, and I think this is getting into acceptable territory.  In
practice, I expect writing more than 3 bytes to a file, as well as disk I/O to
mask any effects that this has.
(To get rid of that 3%, we could have an #defined number of mounts in the
percpu variable.  So, instead of a CPU getting operate only on percpu data
when it accesses only one mount, it could stay on percpu data when it only
accesses N or fewer mounts.)
