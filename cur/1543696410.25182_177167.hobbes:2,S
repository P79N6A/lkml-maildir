Yes. The prev_cpu_load[] array takes a snapshot of the run queue lengths 
seen by the current rq (this_rq). The code is ok as is, and the reason is 
to avoid stealing tasks too fast from remote CPU (cache thing). Time ago I 
also tried to store an K-average (by varying K) rq length in 
prev_cpu_load[] instead of a simple min-of-two-values:
this_rq->prev_cpu_load[i] = (K * this_rq->prev_cpu_load[i] + rq_src->nr_running) / (K + 1);
I couldn't see any major improvements in my 2SMP (never tried on bigger SMP/NUMA).
