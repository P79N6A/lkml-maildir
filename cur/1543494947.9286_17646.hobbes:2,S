Subject: [thump to head] Memory defrag patch from Bill Hawes..
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Recently someone had ported Bill Hawes's mem. defrag patch (he made it mid-2.1
if I remember correctly) to a more recent version of Linux.. I had that on
my old ip masq server but that hard drive decided to give me the magnetized
rust finger recently.
And remember never never never trust any recent 3 1/2 inch floppy because the
quality of them has nosedived recently. :)
So, in a round about way, I'm asking if someone would be so kind to send me an
URL or attachment of that beast because I'm running into 2.2 memfrag problems
and I really want to tinker with his patch again. :) DejaNews doesn't seem to
want to be friendly.
Transmeta must be keeping him shackled in his office with no internet access
like a Nike shoe factory employee or something since he has disappeared once he
started work there. ;-)
I hope for his sake that the pay is better. ;-) ;-) ;-)
