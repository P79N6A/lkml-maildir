So far, the technical implications are mainly "does it create a serious
issue in the distant future" or "does some exotic new feature that
doesn't exist yet cause problems" and not "it's currently broken".
Right now, I can edit a file's permissions, transparently, from any app,
and I haven't noticed any stability issues at all.

Only it can't.  Especially if it's a typical GNOME user, who gets used
to having their files encrypted in foo.tar.pgp, say.  Works in abiword,
works in gedit, breaks in OpenOffice.  Not good.

I'm a vim/ls/tar user.  And I believe the problems with backups to be
very minor.  There are other issues that I don't understand as
thoroughly, so I'll leave them to Al and Linus.

Can you justify why "not all apps can use GNOME transparency" is not a
valid reason?  Would you still think so if GNOME transparency was the
only way to read isofs?
