This might be slightly off topic, but since the official iproute2 list is
down, I thought you guys might be able to help me...
I have an ADSL modem on ppp0, and a CableModem on eth1. The plan is to
make all services available on the ADSL, and use the CableModem as my
default route (load balancing and fail-over are planned). Unfortunately,
Linux gets confused if a public IP comes in on ppp0 since it's default
route is eth1.  It starts logging messages about 'martian sources' and the
reply packet gets lost. The solution is to mark incoming packets on ppp0
and eth1 differently.  iproute2 can then use these fwmarks to route the
reply packets back to the correct interface. In practice, I've gotten ppp0
to work using fwmarks, but eth1 is being stubborn. Let me go through my
configuration:
# My firewall (rcf v5.2.1c2 at 
http://rcf.mvlan.net/
) inserts the
# following chains to mark packets.
ipchains -I ppp0i -m 20 -p tcp -s any/0 -d 64.39.178.10 0:65535
ipchains -I eth1i -m 10 -p tcp -s any/0 -d 24.201.178.12 0:65535
# Here is my iproute2 routing table
root@marvin:/etc/rc.d/init.d$ ip ru ls
0:      from all lookup local
32764:  from all fwmark       10 lookup cable
32765:  from all fwmark       20 lookup adsl
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup 253
# The /etc/iproute2/rt_tables file.
201     cable
202     adsl
# And here are the routing tables. I've added a route to my
# private network to route masqueraded traffic properly.
root@marvin:/etc/rc.d/init.d$ ip ro ls table cable

# The standard routing table. Note that ppp0 is being used as the
# default route right now (lower metric). Until I can get the fwmark
# based routing to work properly on eth1, I can't use it as my
# default route.

Everything is working fine on ppp0, but when packets come in on eth1, the
replies are getting lost. Here are the syslog messages from ipchains when
I log everything:
# Incoming packet gets marked.

The following syslog messages are identical. There are no reply packets
sent back on this interface or any other. I've also snooped all the
interfaces to make sure the reply packet wasn't sent anywhere else. It
just seems to get lost... Here's the tcpdump output for the above
connection:
root@marvin:/tmp$ tcpdump -vvv -X -n -i eth1 port 443

Does anyone see anything I've missed?
BTW, as you can tell, I'm using ipchains under linux 2.2.19. My iproute2
versions is ss990630.
Thanks,
