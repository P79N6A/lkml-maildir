Hi,
On embedded architectures we need to clk_enable()/clk_disable() the
bluetooth uart clock when the bluetooth chip enters/exits low power
mode, to reduce power usage.
This needs to occur independently of the linux cpu suspend/resume
paths, because many bluetooth chips (TI BRF6300 in our case) have
power states that transition independently of the linux cpu: we need
to be able to turn the BT uart off while the linux CPU is running, and
leave the BT uart on while the linux CPU is in suspend.
The BT power state is known in drivers/bluetooth/hci_ll.c which reads
headers on the BT HCI traffic to determine what power state the BT
chip is in.
Our current implementation makes calls directly from hci_ll.c into our
uart driver to tell it when it can clk_enable() / clk_disable().
Sample patch is attached.
We know that calling the uart driver directly from hci_ll.c is
unlikely to get merged upstream, because we have by-passed the tty and
serial_core layers. Are there any suggestions on how to plumb clock
control from hci_ll.c to our uart driver in a way that could get
merged upstream?
Would probably need to use an existing uart_ops (serial_core.h). But
none seem suitable:
   .ioctl uses a mutex, but we cannot sleep from hci_ll.c
   .pm is also called during suspend / resume
   .set_termios using a baud rate of zero to clk_disable() seems
workable, but how to clk_enable() ?
Anyway here is a sample patch. I've just shown how hci_ll.c calls the
msm_serial_clock_*() interface we introduced. The implementation of
msm_serial_clock_*() in msm_serial.c is fairly hefty because of our
requirement to flush the tx path before clk_disable(), and
msm_serial.c is not yet in mainline linux, so for this side of the
implementation please see:

http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=kernel/msm.git;f=drivers/serial/msm_serial.h;hb=android-msm-htc-2.6.25
Requesting comments on how to implement this clock control in a way
that could get merged upstream.
