exit signal 0 is already being used and relied on by kmod - i originally
implemented it that way. In that case the child thread becomes a zombie
until the parent exits, and then it gets reparented to init. I did not
want to break any existing semantics (no matter how broken they appeared
to me) thus i introduced CLONE_DETACHED. But thinking about it, 'a zombie
staying around indefinitely' is not a semantics that it worth carrying too
far? But in case, if signal 0 is the preferred interface then i'm all for
it - this is not really a clone() property but an exit-signalling
property.
