Ok, that's possible.

User can do both - either get events through syscall, or get them from
mapped ring buffer when it is refilled.

There will be some tricks with barriers indeed.

Ok, there is one apologist for mmap buffer implementation, who forced me
to create first implementation, which was dropped due to absense of
remote mental reading abilities. 
Ulrich, does above approach sound good for you? 
I actually do not want to reimplement something, that will be
pointed to with words 'no matter what you say, it is broken and I do not 
want it' again :).
