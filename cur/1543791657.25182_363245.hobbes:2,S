I'd prefer not. The reason is that it increases the "min"
watermark, which only gets used basically by GFP_ATOMIC and
PF_MEMALLOC allocators - neither of which are likely to want
highmem.
Also, I don't think anybody cares about higher order highmem
allocations. At least the patches in this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113082256231168&w=2
Should be applied before this. However they also need more
testing so I'll be sending them to Andrew first.
Patch 2 does basically the same thing as your patch, without
increasing the min watermark.
