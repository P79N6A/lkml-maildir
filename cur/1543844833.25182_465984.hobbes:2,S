Is there a race here between __raw_read_trylock and __raw_write_trylock?
CPU A			CPU B
__raw_read_trylock
atomic_dec(count);
			__raw_write_trylock
			atomic_sub_and_test(RW_LOCK_BIAS, count)
atomic_read(count)
It'd be fairly harmless as neither would manage to get the lock.  But
I think it's not too hard to fix.  Seems to me you want to do:
static inline int __raw_read_trylock(raw_rwlock_t *lock)
{
	atomic_t *count = (atomic_t*)lock;
	if (atomic_dec_return(count) >= 0)
		return 1;
	atomic_inc(count);
	return 0;
}
eliminating the race.
