No, it would go down.  The damage may not be too great thanks to GCSE,
but even that isn't sure especially if asms (via locking code) are
involved.  You really need to brush up on current computer
architectures.  Look in particular the L1 caches structures, cacheline
sizes, cache sizes and branch prediction.  And of course current
compiler technology, so that you actually know what code is generated.
  OG.
