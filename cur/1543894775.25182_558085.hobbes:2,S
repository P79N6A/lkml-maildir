ioperm(), inb(), and outb() from userspace. Needs root, though. Or 
/dev/port, with write. Which comes to the question how they gained root. 
Perhaps live cd? In which case, the OP should, as recommended in this 
thread already, deactivate choosing boot devices, if that's possible.
(Unfortunately, newer BIOSes with 'integrated bootmenu' with F8 or so, 
but I have not seen a way to deactivate _that_ menu.)
