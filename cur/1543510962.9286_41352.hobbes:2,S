Better yet, try chown -R /bigtree, and then take ownership of a large tree
in NT... Arbitrarily complex ACLs hurt metadata performance. Better yet, try
and fully take advantage of NT's ACLs or button down the security flaws.
Then, someone tell me if they think ext[23] hurts where IO is concerned. Can
one resize a NTFS volume? Online? With a patch and some free software, you
can with Linux. Anyone want to say Linux's block allocation algorithm is
inferior??? Have you EVER tried to defrag an NT partition after a short
period of abuse? NT can kiss my *ss.
Please don't mention find though... I'm afraid I can't defend gnu-find or
ext2 in that respect. It's a design thing. Besides, Linux has the fastest
dcache around. (?) (Not to mention noatime & nodiratime)
And remember, if you don't like ext2 for some reason, you can use ReiserFS,
even LVM if you want.

Go bench them. Detailed figures. Then its possible to have a meaningful
discussion on the matter
