LOL.  in wonderland again?

so you're creating a packet-generation tool?
you mentioned already that you had to increase receive-buffers up to some 
large number.  doesn't sound like a very useful packet-generation tool if 
you're internally having to buffer >60K packets . . .
LOL.

Cisco software-based routers?  sure ...
however, if you had an application which required wire-rate minimum-sized 
frames, then a software-based router wouldn't really be your platform of 
choice.
hint: go look at EANTC's testing of GbE and 10GbE L3 switches.
there's public test data of 10GbE with 10,000-line ACLs for both IPv4 & 
IPv6-based L3 switching.
cheers,
lincoln.
