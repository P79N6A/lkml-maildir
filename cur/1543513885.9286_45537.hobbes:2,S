I recompiled the same utils i used for 2.2.12. (and yes, i had to
recompile the utils every time i changed kernel from 2.2.12 to 2.2.13 and
vice-versa). I started using isdn recently and it seems there is a little
confusion about what are the "certified" isdn utils for a specific kernel.
As of the Changes document i used the latest utils snapshot on
ftp.suse.de, i recompiled the utils but no way still. The connection
-gets- established... the only difference is that after
Oct 22 21:19:15 localhost ipppd[471]: local  IP address 212.216.36.24
Oct 22 21:19:15 localhost ipppd[471]: remote IP address 151.99.104.214
(which i think means the connection succeeded and an ip is assigned)
it spits out the message
Oct 22 21:19:15 localhost ipppd[471]: ioctl(SIOCADDRT) device route
(ippp0/151.99.104.0/ffffff00): Network is down
Oct 22 21:19:16 localhost ipppd[471]: LCP terminated by peer
Oct 22 21:19:19 localhost ipppd[471]: Connection terminated.
Oct 22 21:19:19 localhost kernel: isdn_net: local hangup ippp0
and then hangs up.
I also tried to get the latest isdn driver snapshot and installing it
on 2.2.13ac1, but it gives me the same behavior.
