Nice, this is the first time I heard of anyone using filemap_xip on MTD.

ext2fs does have XIP of applications, but of course only works on
block devices, not MTD. Is there more missing than an implementation
of block_device_operations::direct_access for mtd_blktrans_ops?
Why can't you get the same result with a combination of cramfs for
data files and ext2 with -o xip for your mmapped binaries?

Is that a fundamental problem of cramfs, or rather a problem of the
implementation of the linear XIP patches for it? IOW, can't you just
do a better patch to add filemap_xip support to cramfs?

why? by how much?
