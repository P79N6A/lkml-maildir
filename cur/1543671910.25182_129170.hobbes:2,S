Richard and Alan,
Thank you for the info. Given the prototype for poll() is
"int poll(struct pollfd *ufds, unsigned int nfds, int timeout);", and pollfd
is struct pollfd {int fd; short events; short revents};, how do I
communicate complex info to the driver?
For example, assuming there are 8 input lines on my hardware, and the user
wants to be notified in the following three cases:
1) input on Line 1 only,
2) input on either Line 2 or Line 3,
3) input on both Line 4 and Line 5,
how do I pass that info to the driver? Also, other than POLLERR and POLLHUP,
can I pass back to the user more descriptive error messages?
Thanks,
Shuyu

You normally use poll() or select() for this. It's called poll()
inside the driver.
The user-mode code sleeps in poll() or select(). When your
driver ISR wants to wake up the process, it calls
wake_up_interruptible() from within the ISR.
