Yes, it means the warnings are not printed, it doesn't mean the problem
has gone away though.
I'd still like for someone to tell me if there is a specific reason to
use signed numbers in for example inode.c in one of the filesystems
(can't remember which one of the top of my head). I for one would get
rather surprised if some of my data started getting stored with negative
inodes...
