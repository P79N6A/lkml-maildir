Yes it could be a modem on the line, so my comment about DCD is wrong, a comms
program must be able to send AT commands to the modem when DCD is not asserted
before the call is setup. I was being confused by the login getty which we run
on the same serial port. This drops back to the login prompt if it sees DCD
being dropped.
