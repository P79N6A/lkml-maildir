Yes, I saw your patch for packet writing but:
- the CD written with packet writing software may not be readable
  on standard CD-ROM drives (and I want that, because almost 
  everybody has one).
- using packet writing you basically write _files_ on top of an
  UDF filesystem. Tar and dump (or afio, cpio etc) does not
  support that kind of access, they expect to be given a character
  device they can stream data to. (Of course, it is possible to
  add some additionnal level of indirection on top of the packet
  device and provide character based access to the UDF files, but
  IMHO _this_ would be overkill).
- data backups are expected to be fast. Writing data in DAO/TAO
  mode is much quicker than in packet mode.
- reliability is a question of implementation. cdrecord can
  be very reliable. If a user space application can provide this
  level of reliability, it should be even simpler to achieve it
  in kernel space (and I plan to use the BurnProof/etc extensions
  which will be present on all future cdwriters).

Please pay attention to the fact that I was refering to the 'low level
code'. I don't intend to write a driver who can replace cdrecord. 
_This_ would be madness.
What I indend to do is just a 'small' driver, which supports only the
mmc drives. I expect the driver to be only some hundreds lines long.
Doing that from user space would mean propagating the data from
the user space application (dump or tar) to a character mode
driver, and back to a user space application (something like a hacked 
cdrecord), which will return in kernel space using sg interface...
It could be easier to write (even if I don't exactly feel confident
about hacking the cdrecord source :) ), but the reliability and
the performance would be far far away...
