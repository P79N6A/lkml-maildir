Agreed, I see that point - if it's a globally accessed file that's
created by one CPU, you want it spread around. However ... how the hell
is the VM meant to distinguish that? The correct way is for the application
to tell us that - ie use the NUMA API.

There are definitely situations where you'd want both, I'd agree.

Well, it's not quite worst case  ... you'll only get (n-1)/n of your pages
off node (where n is number of nodes). I guess we could deliberately
force ALL of them off-node just to make sure ;-)

It is if you tell it from the app ;-) But otherwise yes, I'd agree.

I guess Hugh or Andrew. But I'm very relucant to see the current default
changed to benefit one particular set of workloads ... unless there's
overwhelming evidence that those workloads are massively predominant.
A per-arch thing might make sense I suppose if you're convinced that
all ia64 NUMA machines will ever run is HPC apps.

Another way might be a tmpfs mount option ... I'd prefer that to a sysctl
personally, but maybe others wouldn't. Hugh, is that nuts?
