Yup.

And you're reasonably convinced that this did not happen with 2.3.3 for
you? Or did you not run 2.3.3 enough to have an opinion one way or the
other..
I just want to make sure that I look at the rigth patches when tryign to
see what's up?
The other (obvious) thing I'd like to verify is whether the problem
happens with gcc-2.7.2 too.. This can't be the alias issue, but it could
be something else, and if it's a compiler difference then the _real_
problem may be somewhere else than in the 2.3.4 changes - 2.3.4 may just
have exposed a completely unrelated thing (whether compiler of kernel) for
instruction scheduling reasons or something..

Or the 4kB size just makes the IO patterns different enough that a driver
problem occurs.. IDE changes did happen in 2.3.4..
