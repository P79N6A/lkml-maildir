you meant code like this 
int main() { while(1) { fork(); fork(); exit(); } }
 is more harmful ? I dont see why (?)

If so, forkbomb doesnt cause much problem like they said, since
eventually it would be killed once it reach the limit of memory. the
system will recover automatically after awhile.

I dont see any advantages of halving the max_threads like this at all.
That doesnt solve the problem. You should focus elsewhere.
