Well I was sitting on them with the intention of taking a look later and
trying to work out what the heck you two have been going on about.
But maybe dropping them means that we'll later get a clear and concise
description of the problem and its solution, so I'll do that.
(This was supposed to be just a simple "consolidate
set_current_state+schedule_timeout into a single function call" patch. 
What happened?)
