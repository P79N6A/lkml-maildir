Subject: [PATCH] checksum.c & csum_partial_copy.c ,2.6.12.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I send this patch to you as I sent it to the alpha
port maintainer(rth@twiddle.net) according to kernel
file MAINTAINERS and I got no reply!
Hello I am Ioannis Barkas.You can contact me at
risc4all@yahoo.com.
There is a typo error in the comments area of
linux-2.6.12.5\arch\alpha\lib at the files 
checksum.c
csum_partial_copy.c
I found this bug after visiting
http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Bugs/3.9-2005-05-27.I
 had
submitted bug # 24).Next day I visited it again for
additional comments and someone else had reported bug
# 25) about a suspicious typo error in the knoppix
boot menu help.That time it was clear and obvious to
me that the kernel would suffer from this error.Here I
note that the unknown guy deserves some credits on
this patch.DESPITE THAT,I HAD THE FINAL IDEA TO CHECK
THE ERROR INSIDE THE WHOLE LINUX KERNEL.Luckily it
affected only those two files.
This error is repeated also in previous kernels such
as the 2.6.9 .
