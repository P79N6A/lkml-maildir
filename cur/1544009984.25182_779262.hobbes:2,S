Yes, that is what I was thinking. But after some grep on the PCI device
drivers, I feel frustrated because all those drivers only do 'ioremap'
once at the 'probe' stage.
I believe this is the only problem that preclude us having the run-time
resource rebalance. And I'm not sure how much effort we can fix it. Any
comments?
