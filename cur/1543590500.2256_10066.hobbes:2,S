Subject: Deadlock in 2.2 sock_alloc_send_skb?

Hi Alan,
we've experienced deadlocks that appear to be caused by the loop in
sock_alloc_send_skb().  To trigger this, you need to combine heavy
network load with memory pressure.  In this situation, sock_wmalloc()
can fail because it really can't allocate any more memory, even though
the send buffer limit for this socket is not yet exhausted.
If that happens, and the socket uses GFP_ATOMIC allocation, the while (1)
loop in sock_alloc_send_skb() will endlessly spin, without ever calling
schedule(), and all the time holding the kernel lock ...
Do you agree that this is a problem?  What do you think about this fix:

Test case is simple:  keep spawning lots of long-running 'ping' processes
until physical memory is exhausted.
