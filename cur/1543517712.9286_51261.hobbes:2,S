Searching for a channel bonding patch for a 2.2 or 2.3 kernel, i have just
found a BROKEN LINK at cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov, which pointed (when it was
alive) to a 2.0.2 kernel patch. I also saw that in the past, answers sent
here for this patch were just ignored with messages like: see Becker's
page... well, the problem is that I did this and it is not there. 
Can somebody help me to find a 2.2 or 2.3 ethernet channel bonding patch?
Or it is just a forgotten and for years not updated thing?
