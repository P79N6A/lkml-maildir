I'm not sure how true that is these days.  OLTP DB servers
with a lot of RAM will typically do more write traffic, all
pushed by fsync, than reads.  (Some may claim that that
means your server is overspecced, of course.)
Other servers, too, look rather like that -- mail servers
do a lot of fsync, web servers generally have smallish web
trees but write a lot of logs...
Even on data warehousing apps, there will be a fairly high
level of writes due to use of temporary relations..
