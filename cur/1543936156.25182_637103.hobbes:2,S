How about throwing out hand-rolled debug printk wrappers for the
brain-damage they are and using the ones the kernel provides instead?
dev_dbg() and pr_debug() both manage to get these semantics right, and
you can even bury the #define DEBUG underneath some Kconfig silliness if
you're the kind of person that leans that way.
Maybe we can just amend checkpatch to delete a patch out of protest if it
introduces printk() wrappers..
