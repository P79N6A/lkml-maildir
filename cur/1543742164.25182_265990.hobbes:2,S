  You oversimplify.  For example, I have:
        1 uniprocessor IOAPIC (i440FX)
        1 SMP IOAPIC (flat mode) (i440GX)
        2 XT-PIC noapic (i440BX, VIA KT133)

  And again:
        1 VIA VT82C686
        1 HPT370A
        1 PDC20267
        1 PDC20268
        1 PIIX3
        2 PIIX4
  So even in my 'simple' i386 environment there is a lot of variety in
just those two things.

  If Linux had a billion users, how many would have something different?
