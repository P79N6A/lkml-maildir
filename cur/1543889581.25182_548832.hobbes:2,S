Compiling now. I had lost a lot of time because at first try it stopped
in ntfs:
  CC [M]  fs/ntfs/super.o
fs/ntfs/super.c: In function ‘init_ntfs_fs’:
fs/ntfs/super.c:3152: error: expected ‘)’ before ‘NTFS_VERSION’
fs/ntfs/super.c: At top level:
fs/ntfs/super.c:3262: error: expected ‘,’ or ‘;’ before ‘NTFS_VERSION’
make[2]: *** [fs/ntfs/super.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs/ntfs] Error 2
make: *** [fs] Error 2
I suppose because NTFS_VERSION were defined as EXTRA_CFLAGS too in the Makefile, 
and I corrected it adding a fake #define NTFS_VERSION in super.c. Then I
got to a meeting, and coming back:
  CC [M]  fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot.o
fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot.c:18:17: error: xfs.h: No such file or directory
fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot.c:19:20: error: xfs_fs.h: No such file or directory
fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot.c:20:21: error: xfs_bit.h: No such file or directory
fs/xfs/quota/xfs_dquot.c:21:21: error: xfs_log.h: No such file or directory
So I gave up and lost^Wused a couple of hours trimming  down .config, and 
now it's compiling.
