ah, that's excellent. Now we're pretty sure that either :
  a) the packets are corrupted somewhere (but I believe you told that the
     checksums were indicated OK)
  b) there is something wrong on the client side, either a major tuning
     issue (but I don't see what may cause this) or a bug (more likely)
Do you know how many sessions/s you have between the client and the server ?
Is it in the order of 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ? Also, I think that a full
capture of the same session on both ends will help (either join the pcap
file, or decode it with tcpdump -Snevvvs0). For instance, it would be
possible (though strange) that for an unknown reason, sometimes the ARP
entry for the client in the server table is wrong, so that the client does
not accept the SYN-ACK. However, sniffing it in promiscuous mode still shows
it.
