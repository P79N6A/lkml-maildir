Right.  The mp3 decoder is also (as far as I know) unencumbered, and I
have no intent of putting an mp3 encoder in.  I certainly don't mind
adding Ogg support, it's just not a really big priority.

Yes, mp3 doesn't make sense either in general except for music on hold,
for example.  In fact I've considered dropping it entirely from Asterisk
except that since it's already there, I don't see an overwhelming reason
to remove it.

The streaming format is quite irrelevant here.  It's the size of window
that you are encoding that is important.  Some review of the
vorbis-spec-intro reveals that it may be able to support smaller frame
sizes and sampling rates, so it might be worth giving then a call.

In general, Asterisk's prompts are stored in GSM since it is so
inexpensive to compute and generally about the same size as MP3 / Ogg when
corrected for bit rate (and obviously much smaller when not corrected for
bit rate).

If you'd like to sign up on the Asterisk mailing list, that is presumably
a much better arena for discussing this.  If Ogg makes sense to add to
Asterisk I'd certainly be happy to do so.
