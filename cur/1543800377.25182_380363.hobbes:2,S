It is very important when you have many processes wasting lots of unused
memory. For instance, when firefox allocates 10 MB and uses only 3, then
the remaining 7 MB can be used by another process. But if finally firefox
tries to use them, and there is no memory left, then chances are that some
processes will be killed. I believe the same problem happens after a fork()
because data gets COWed but I'm not certain about this.
I'd bet that using a heavy GUI under X with no swap an overcommit_ratio
set around 95%, you could get occasionnal malloc() failures. But once
again, I may be wrong.

I think it's going unstable above 95% because there are lots of other
areas consuming memory. I don't know for example if dentry caches,
network buffers, various hash tables, etc... are accounted for.
