No, what is at fault is thinking that the BK revision numbers mean 
anything. They don't.
A BK revision number is _purely_ local to the tree it was gotten off, and 
will be meaningless after a merge of two trees have happened. The only 
thing that really means anything in BK is the "ChangeSet key", which is a 
truly unique identifier, and is painful as hell to type because of that.
In this case, the key for the changeset that Alessandro was talking about 
is
	torvalds@home.transmeta.com|ChangeSet|20020529050157|61124
(currently revision 1.373.214.73 in my tree) and the key for the fix is 
	hugh@veritas.com|ChangeSet|20021001154212|00224
(currently 1.573.94.1 in my tree).
You can see the key's with "bk changes -k", or if you want to see a 
combination of keys etc you can do more fancy stuff (I used
	bk changes -d":KEY: ':REV:'\n:AUTHOR:\n:COMMENTS:\n" | less
to search for comments and key information, in case you care).
Thus endeth BK 101.
