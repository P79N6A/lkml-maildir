i've got a more complete patch against vanilla 2.6.8-rc2:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/defer-softirqs-2.6.8-rc2-A2
which introduces the following tunable:
    /proc/sys/kernel/defer_softirqs  (default: 0)
this, if enabled, causes all softirqs to be processed within ksoftirqd,
and it also breaks out of the softirq loop if preemption of ksoftirqd
has been triggered by a higher-prio task.
I've also added this additional break-out to the -H6 patch of
voluntary-preempt:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8-rc2-H6
it's enabled by default.
	Ingo
