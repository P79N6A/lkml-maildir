   Oh crap, you're right...   eepro100 in general does funky stuff with the 
   way packets are handled, mainly due to the need to issue commands to the 
   NIC engine instead of the normal per-descriptor owner bit way of doing 
   things.
The question is, do the descriptor bits have to live right before
the RX packet data buffer or can other schemes be used?
