In theory it could certainly be useful - but it can only be done if
something in the kernel is already keeping track of resources on a
per-task basis. This works for CPU, but isn't really possible for
memory without doing something lame like just adding up the tasks' RSS
values (since the page accounting is the hard part - limiting is easy
once you have accounting).
