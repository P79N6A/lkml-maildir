Let me explain a 3rd time:
1) run dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdaN on a system with 4GB RAM
2) the pagecache mapping for /dev/hdaN can only come from
    lowmem, of which we have roughly 900MB
3) the dirty_limit is 40% of 4GB, or roughly 1.6GB - the dd
    from (1) will not throttle itself at all, but will just
    fill up lowmem without limitation
4) any memory that could be affected by the swap token (process
    text, data, stack, ...) is allocated with __GFP_HIGHMEM, so
    that all lives in the highmem zone with 2.5GB free
5) since dd is not being paged out at all, and can dirty memory
    without limit, the VM gets backed into a corner and will
    trigger an OOM kill - even though most of lowmem is simply
    dirty page cache
6) an unpatched 2.6.10-rc kernel will OOM kill in minutes on
    a test system here
6) Andrew's total_pages patch, marcelo's vm-writeout-throttle patch
    and my two patches improve the situation a lot, and the OOM kill
    takes a day or so to be triggered
If you have any more questions as to why the bug happens, don't
hesitate to ask and I'll explain you why this problem happens.
