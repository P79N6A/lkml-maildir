ELF can do symbol versioning too. But I don't really see a simple way to
make normal ELF linking work with a kernel like that. The vmlinux ELF
file is long gone by the time the kernel boots -- it needs its own
mechanism for managing its symbols anyway; its own internal dynamic
linker. I suppose you _could_ make it work from the standard ELF linkage
but I don't think it'd be fun.
ObMODVERSIONS: Forgot to mention that my makefile hacks for --combine
break that completely. It tries to preprocess all the files together
with 'gcc -E -D__GENKSYMS__ *.c' -- and you can't do that.
