Dominik did a speedy backport to current 2.4.
You can find them at 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/cpufreq/
There's patches there for mainline and -ac, so should apply
to whatever other patchset you choose to use, at worse there'll
be trivial-to-fix-up rejects.
This backport also contains Jeremy's Centrino-speedstep driver.
