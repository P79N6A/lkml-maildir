This looks incorrect.
There are many arches where legacy binaries expect the executability for
virtually all their address-space (my guess is all but x86-64 and ia64),
and even on those two legacy binaries expected at least stack executable.
And on x86-64 and ia64 ia32 binaries (i.e. when binfmt_elf.c is included
in their binfmt_elf32.c or how is it called) should have VM_EXEC and
VM_MAYEXEC in def_flags.
