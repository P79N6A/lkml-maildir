DMA overhead perhaps?  If it takes so many micro/nanoseconds to get a 
DMA going....  That used to be a reason the Tigon2 had such low PPS 
rates and issues with multiple buffer packets and a 1500 byte MTU - it 
had rather high DMA setup latency, and then if you put it into a system 
with highish DMA read/write latency... well that didn't make it any 
better :)
