The change itself looks good but IMO it is worth doing it before patch #2/3
(it would also make it possible for me to merge this patch immediately).
When it comes to patch #2 - Alan's comment may be a bit harsh but he seems
to be right - there should be a common library-like file (ata-blacklist.c
or ata-quirks.c or whatever name you like) containing ata_device_blacklist[].
This would require slight modification of ide_in_drive_list() to teach
it about ATA_HORKAGE_DMA but as I see from this patch this shouldn't be
a problem for you. ;)  Please also note that <linux/ata.h> is used by both
IDE and libata so it should be a good place to put struct ata_blacklist_entry
and ATA_HORKAGE_* macros.
Care to respin both patches?

Yep, thanks for not breaking AMD Alchemy IDE suppport.
It looks like au1xxx_ide.h should really be in drivers/ide/mips because
it is only included from drivers/ide/mips/au1xxx_ide.c - could somebody
verify this and send me a patch?
Thanks,
Bart
