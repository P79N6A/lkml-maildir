Considering that Bayesian filters are useless against the new spam that 
is proliferating these days, that's laughable.  Spam now comes with a 
good 5-10K of random dictionary words.
I use challenge-response and the only spam that gets to my inbox now 
comes from lists.  I pre-listed all my buddies in my whitelist, only new 
senders that I'm not yet aware of have to go thru the challenge process.
If you can't handle clicking on a link to authorize your email, then I'm 
not interested in your email. If that tiny few seconds  of effort is a 
waste of your time, then writing your email to me was also a waste of 
your time.
Getting well over 900 spams a day on average, almost double on mondays, 
just isn't my cup of tea.  There is no one solution to spam.  I 
pre-filter with spamassassin using all it's tools, anything scoring high 
automatically gets /dev/nulled.  Those include bayesian, pattern 
matches, DNSBL, etc. Next I attempt to filter viruses and the like.  The 
remainder goes through TMDA.
Spamassassin cuts it down to less than 100 typically, and of that, about 
50 are on the border.  TMDA takes care of the rest.  The majority of 
spam making it through SA is the dictionary attack spam.  My 
retro-impact on spam is minimized.
It's getting really annoying because spammers are taking input emails 
like LKML and making word lists out of the emails.
Hmm, 900 spams in my mailbox, or half a dozen due to lists.  I'll take 
the second.
