What state? This is a global state? The kmem_cache struct is rarely
written to after setting up the slab. Any writes could create a serious 
performance problem on large scale systems.

Nor should you ever write to the kmem_cache structure concurrently at all.

You are accessing a kmem_cache structure field in the hot path. That 
cacheline is never used in the hot path. Sorry this is way to intrusive 
for the problem you are trying to solve.
