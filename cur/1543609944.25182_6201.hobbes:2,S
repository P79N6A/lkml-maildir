OK, that makes sense.  Thanks.  The `mount' and `chattr' manpages
need updating...
So shall we try to nail this down?  Synchronous mounts and chattr +S
provide synchronous semantics for directory contents, diretory metadata
and directory inodes only.  And fsync() will write out a file's data,
metadata and inode?
If this is correct then there are a few places where ext2 is
syncing stuff unnecessarily - file indirect blocks, etc.  Not
very important at this stage I guess.
