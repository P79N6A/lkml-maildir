Thank you Rafael,
I think I've found a solution: Not the kernel or ACPI is guilty, just my
Notebook :-) I changed my acpi scripts a little and now it's working
again. I had to play around with vbetool and 915resolution called in
proper order.
You pointed me to this solution and I already signed off from the
mailing lists. Thanks again,
Christian
My new suspend/resume part:
/sbin/hwclock --systohc
/usr/bin/chvt 1
/usr/local/sbin/vbetool vbestate save > /tmp/vbestate-save
/usr/bin/sync
echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk
echo disk > /sys/power/state
/sbin/hwclock --hctosys
/usr/local/sbin/vbetool vbestate restore < /tmp/vbestate-save
/usr/sbin/915resolution 3c 1400 1050
/usr/bin/chvt 2 #my X vt
The old one was just:
echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk
echo disk > /sys/power/state
/usr/sbin/915resolution 3c 1400 1050
