Seen some drives at one point (I think those were maxtor) that take
_exactly_ 30 seconds to stop asserting BUSY after a HW reset.

Doesn't window spin drives asynchronously ? The main problem I've seen
in practice (appart from the above maxtor drives) are ATAPI CD/DVD
drives. There are whole generations of those that will happily drive
your bus to some crazy state (even when only slave and not selected) for
a long time while they spin up and try to identify the disk in them on a
hard reset (and if they have trouble identifying the disk, like a
scratched disk, that can take a loooong time).

It's only a timeout. If you drives are fast, it will come up fast... if
you drives are slow, it will come up slow, and if your drives are
broken, you'll wait at most 31 seconds. Seems ok to me... It would be
nicer in the long run if libata could resume asynchronously (by keeping
the request queue blocked until full resume and polling the BUSY from a
thread or a timer), but I don't think we should lower the timeout.
