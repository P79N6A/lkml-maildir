This is a well-known behaviour (see the list archives of
netfilter-devel@lists.netfilter.org or ulogd@lists.gnumonks.org).
This is _NOT_ considered a bug, but a feature.

so how would you then differentiate in userspace between 
a) a skb receive timestamp
b) a timestamp created within the ULOG target (which can be very
   different, think of async packets via QUEUE, etc.)
We definitely don't want to have one field in the packet that has
different semantics according from which hook it came in.
What ulogd currently does, is _always_ logging the userspace time,
disregarding the skb receive timestamp.  This is way closer to the LOG
target behaviuor anyway, since in this case the time is prepended by
syslogd (which just calls gettimeofday() from userspace).
