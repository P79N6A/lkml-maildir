what I was thinking was to use power at full load for the power rateing of 
each mode.

this seems to be contradicted by the fact that AMD is listing the ability 
for each core to run at a different clock speed on the new 4-core chips as 
an advantage. if you always want to run at the max frequency PERIOD then 
why bother engineering the ability to do otherwise? (as opposed to just 
shutting down unused cores)
another example is the 80 core demo chip that Intel has been makeing press 
about. it can run at 1Tflop on 25w of power and 2Tflop at 150w of power. 
running at max freq for a 1Tflop workload would have you eating ~75w of 
power (the numbers may be off, I'm going from memory, but the cost in 
power of doubling the speed was _far_ more then double the power 
requirements)

only if the transitions don't cost anything significant, and the 
computation capacity per watt of power is the same at all frequencies. the 
chip performance numbers I've been seeing (which I admit are mostly 
embedded datasheets) indicate that neither of these hold true.
