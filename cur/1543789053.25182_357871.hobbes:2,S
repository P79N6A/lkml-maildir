The wanted to have some information for use by udev. After looking at
the patch I wonder why they can't use the cutype/devtype attributes.
They already contain the information that gets exported by the new
attribute. It might be a little bit harder to parse because devtype can
be "n/a" but that certainly isn't rocket science.
