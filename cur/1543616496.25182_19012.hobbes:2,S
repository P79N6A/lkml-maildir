Which part of "locked up console system" you don't understand ? :-)
( There is a smiley on that line. It was ment to be funny. No need
to get mad at me and send me suspicios white powder over snail mail ! )
Maybe I did not describe the problem detailed enough. I thought everybody
can check it for themselves :-)
After running "X 2>&1 | less" you get a black screen and it does not respond to
any keypresses any more.
I will take this to the xfree people as David S. Miler suggested.
