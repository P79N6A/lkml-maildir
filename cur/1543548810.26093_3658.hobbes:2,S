Subject: Proc fs limit workaround?

I have a machine with many partitions, and /proc/partitions, being limited to 4K output, doesn't display all the information I need.
My first question/request is has anyone else already written a patch to get around the 4K limit?
And second, why is the 4K limit there in the first place?
Thanks,
Nick
