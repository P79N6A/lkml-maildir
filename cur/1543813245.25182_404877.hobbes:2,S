If it's known that callers of generic_alloc_nodedata() can just never ever
be permitted to sleep then OK.  But GFP_KERNEL allocations are always
preferable.

Should the patch provide stubs for generic_alloc_nodedata() and
generic_alloc_nodedata() if !CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_NODEDATA_EXTENSION?
(If all callers are also inside #ifdef CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_NODEDATA_EXTENSION
then the answer would be "no").
