This looks like the ancient version of the monitor patch - which
includes importing a lot of needless junk from the linux-wlan-ng
tree.  A cleaned up version of monitor has been merged in the orinoco
CVS tree for ages now, but unfortunately that's long overdue for a
merge with mainline.  I'm trying to get that merge done - I just don't
have much time or energy for the orinoco driver these days.  One stack
of patches which gets part of the way went to Jeff Garzik last week.
We'll see how we go.
In the meantime go to 
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/orinoco
 for
access to the driver CVS.  You probably want to get the "for_linus"
branch of CVS if you're planning to work with 2.6.
