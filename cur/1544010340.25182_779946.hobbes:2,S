Hmm.  It is the argument ordering used by NetBSD, thats why I used that
too.  It certainly should be the application-visible ordering.  We'll
have glibc between apps and kernel though, so I think we can reorder the
arguments at syscall level if that helps on these archs.  Cc'ing Ulrich
Drepper for comments on that.

sys_{readv,writev} have unsigned long too, this is where I got it from.
 Don't know what the reason for this is, it looks a bit odd indeed.
