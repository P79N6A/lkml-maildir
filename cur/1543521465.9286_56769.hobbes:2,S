   I think I spotted and fixed the bug that is soft-deadlocking your
   2.2.x compaq cluster (all seems to make sense :). Could you try the
   below patch against 2.2.14 (or 2.2.14aa1 or 2.2.13 or 2.2.13aa6)?
Wrong, all callers of tcp_send_delayed_ack _guarentee_ that the
quickack bit is clear.  Your patch does nothing, put an assert
there if you don't believe me.
Later,
