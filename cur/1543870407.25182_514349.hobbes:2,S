It is to attempt to make it easier for our end users to configure&use.
Most people who use it, want to make some tweaks to the configuration based on 
their embedded platform. Rather than forcing everyone to make changes to a .c 
or .h file, we let them manage it in the .config (which is platforms specific 
anyway).
