The packet scheduler and classifier can redirect packets to different
devices, and can the netfilter layer.
The setting of skb->dev is wholly transient and you cannot rely upon
it to be the same as when you set it on allocation.
Even simple things like the bonding device change skb->dev on every
receive.
I think you need to study the networking stack a little more before
you continue to play in this delicate area :-)
