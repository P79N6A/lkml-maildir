I'll take a look at xfs to see what I can get out of it.
There are basically two times when you have to do this
for_each_possible_cpu() stuff:
1. when doing a r/w->r/o transition, which is rare, and
   certainly not a fast path
2. Where the per-cpu writer count underflows.  This requires
   a _minimum_ of 1<<16 file opens (configurable) each of which
   is closed on a different cpu than it was opened on.  Even
   if you were trying, I'm not sure you'd notice the overhead.
