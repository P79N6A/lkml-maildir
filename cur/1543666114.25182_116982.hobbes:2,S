I have used exactly this process, and it works as you expect. In this 
situation you're not really using the initrd as a "classic" initrd, it's 
just a temporary root filesystem. The kernel has no idea what the real 
root is going to be, and that determination isn't made until the 
initrd's scripts decide what to mount and then pivot_root to it.
Much cleaner than the old way.
