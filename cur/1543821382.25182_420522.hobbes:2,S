I tripped over this apparent regression when I hit a problem with some code
that expected this behavior.  Given the documented behavior of the mount syscall
(see below), apparently propagating all flags intact and clearing all
flags are the only 2 options that don't break the documented API.

Well, absent a '-o newflags' to modify it, propagating the originals
probably follows the Principle of Least Surprise.   And whether mountflags
are permissible is an API change issue...

Here, there's a -o parameter being passed.

Can of worms, too complicated for 3AM. :)

More worms. ;)
Note that any provision for changing the mountflags *IS* a break of
the documented API.  'man 2 mount' says specifically:
       MS_BIND
              (Linux 2.4 onwards) Perform a bind mount, making  a  file  or  a
              directory subtree visible at another point within a file system.
              Bind mounts may cross file system boundaries and span  chroot(2)
              jails.   The  filesystemtype, mountflags, and data arguments are
              ignored.
I admit not knowing that whether POSIX or other standards specify that
mountflags be ignored.
