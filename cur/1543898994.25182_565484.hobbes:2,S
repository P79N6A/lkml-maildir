Obviously.  But I wasn't about the server trying to acquire a lock
held by a client.  I was talking about a client trying to acquire a
lock held by _another_ client.
If this coincides with the server (or some other task which the server
is depending on) being frozen before the clients, the freezer has a
problem.

Huh?
