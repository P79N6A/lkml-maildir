Yes... if a CPU idle then we move process onto it, but otherwise no.
In modern CPUs it doesn't take long to warm the caches so I don't
think the odd unnecessary hop is going to be all that bad... and it
will almost never happen when we have lots and lots of CPU bound taks
relative to the number of CPUs available.
(I was under the impression this is how it worked now anyhow?)
