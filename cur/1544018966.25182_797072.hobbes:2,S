Basic idea is to steal some (probably a lot) pages from the slab
allocator and put network buffers there without strict need for
power-of-two alignment and possible wraps when we add skb_shared_info at
the end, so that old e1000 driver required order-4 allocations for the
jumbo frames. We can do that in alloc_skb() and friends and put returned
buffers into skb's fraglist and updated reference counters for those
pages; and with additional copy of the network headers into skb->head.
