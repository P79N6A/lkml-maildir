That's not what I'm talking about.
The _request_ side is fine, and yes, it needs to be done early.
It's the module unload time that is broken - it doesn't remember whether
it requested the legacy mode addresses, so instead it uses the address
_values_ to determine if it did so or not, and that's broken: it is
conceivable at least in theory that a PCI BAR would contain the legacy
mode address value, without the legacy mode bit being set. In that case we 
have _not_ done the legacy-mode "request_region()", but we _will_ do the 
"release_region()".
Exactly because the code checks the wrong thing. That's also the thing 
that makes for problems for iomap. What used to be the wrong thing to test 
now becomes _impossible_ to test.
If the code had just saved the value of "legacy_mode" from the probing 
phase, the release phase wouldn't have any ambiguous cases, and the iomap 
code wouldn't have any issues either..
