I did a bit of playing about with the changelog generate script,
trying to produce a faster version.  The attached version uses a
couple of improvements to be a lot faster (e.g. no recursion in the
common case of one parent).
FWIW it is 7x faster than makechlog.sh (4.342 secs vs 34.129 secs) and
28x faster than gitlog.sh (4.342 secs vs 2 mins 4 secs) on my
hardware.  You mileage may of course vary.
