        No problem.. modprobe ran cleanly without any unresolved symbols. 
however, with those programs needing OSS opl3 emulation (xmms, mpg123, 
realplayer to name a few), this won't do much good less they forsake OSS 
altogether. The 3 programs above (except xmms, which I believe works with 
ALSA) depend on /dev/dsp existing for them to run. /dev/dsp gets created 
(using DevFS here) when snd-pcm-oss.o is inserted at modprobe time. Hence, the 
below:
root@bellicha:~# modprobe snd-fm801
modprobe: Can't locate module snd-pcm-oss
/lib/modules/2.5.15/kernel/sound/pci/snd-fm801.o: post-install snd-fm801 failed
/lib/modules/2.5.15/kernel/sound/pci/snd-fm801.o: insmod snd-fm801 failed
/etc/modules.conf:
# This is for the new ForteMedia 801 card now, using ALSA.
alias char-major-116 snd
# OSS/Free emulation
alias char-major-14 soundcore
alias snd-card-0 snd-fm801
alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
options snd snd_major=116 snd_cards_limit=1
post-install snd-fm801 modprobe "-k" "snd-pcm-oss"
        For those to run, opl3_oss.c needs to be compiled, which leads back to 
where we were before..
