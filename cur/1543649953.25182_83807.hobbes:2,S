I have a CUSL2-C board, P3-800 Coppermine and a Ultra133TX2 controller.

I have the same problem. This is a known problem in the vanilla kernels
(still in 2.4.20-pre11). You can force the right UDMA setting by giving
a "ideX=ata66" kernel boot parameter, where the "X" is your interface
number. This is fixed in recent -ac kernels (I tested with
2.4.20-pre10-ac2).

This is nasty, I experience this too. This is different from the problem
you describe earlier. I already checked different recent kernels, BIOS
versions, NICs, memory, processors, and still it hangs. I suspect it's a
unknown bug in the driver or a hardware bug in the controller. The
problem is that it hangs completely dead, giving no information to start
debugging. :(

Like you, I also have other boxes with Promise Ultra66/100/133
controllers, with _different_ motherboards, which indeed don't have such
problem, so the combination of motherboard <-> controller looks
important here.

Ditto.

Well, it has. And I'm still hoping to solve this one. I an open to any
suggestions, patches or tests.
