Apply the preempt patch and then the preempt-stats patch.  Follow
instructions that come with the stats patch.  It will report on the
longest preempt disable times since the last report.  You need to
provide a load that will exercise the bad code, but it will tell you
which, where, and how bad.  Note: it measures preempt off time, NOT how
long it took to get to some task, i.e. it does not depend on requesting
preemption at the worst possible time.
