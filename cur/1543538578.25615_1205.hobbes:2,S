Set the flag.

Mark it empty.  The info the journal will have already been committed to
the MFT -- the journal just allows the cache manager to go back and
verify each transaction.  Just zapping it the first time it's munted
read/write will completely avoid this problem :-).

Correct, there's also a MOUNTED_ON_NT4 bit in the Volume Flags Field as
well for W2K volumes that have been converted -- very good -- A+.

Sounds like we need a repair utility first so you don't have to keep
reinstalling W2K everytime the drive gets trashed.  Set the dirty
squared bit, and you'll find that chkdsk will be able fix the volume
more often without always needing to re-install.  You may also want to
download alritis image blaster or express from www.altris.com so you can
image your NTFS volumes and store them offline so when one gets trashed
you can just boot to DOS or linux and restore the volume.  Will save you
a lot of time ....
