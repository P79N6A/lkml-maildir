Hi Gregory, Wikimedia Foundation and LKML? 
How's Wikimania going. :-)
What he says is correct.  I have seen some serious issues with reiserfs 
in terms of stability and
data corruption.  Resier is however FASTER, but the statement is has 
robustness issues is accurate.
I was using reiserfs but we opted to make EXT3 the default for Solera 
appliances, even when using Suse 10
due to issues I have seen with data corruption and hard hangs on RAID 0 
read/write sector errors.  I have
stopped using it for local drives and based everything on EXT3.  Not to 
say it won't get there eventually, but
file systems have to endure a lot of time in the field and deployment 
befor they are ready for prime time.
The Wikimedia appliances use Wolf Mountain, and I've tested it for about 
4 months with few problems, but
I only use it for hosting the Cherokee Langauge Wikipedia.  It's 
performance is several magnitudes better
than either EXT3 or ReiserFS.  Despite this, for vertical wiki servers, 
its ok to go out with, folks can specifiy
whether they want appliances with EXT3, Reiser, or WMFS, but iit's a 
long way from being "cooked"
completely, though it does scale to 1 exabyte FS images. 
Reiser does have issues still, and I hestitate to standardize on it 
until I stop seeing reports from the field about
corruption and failover issues.
Jeff
