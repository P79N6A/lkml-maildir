Really?  What is the error condition causing it?  On my friends lap, which
has an integrated sky2, his drops out with a full sustained TX...
uploading to another box for example, at about 4-8MB of transfer.  The
fix in his case is ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0.  I have
yet to see the error occur at all on my ExpressCard device, either with
2.6.18-rc5 or 2.6.17.5.  I built the rc5 as a preemptive measure, but I
cannot get it to fail under any conditions.
