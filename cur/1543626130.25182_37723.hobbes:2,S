Known problem, but thanks for reminding me.  I suggest just disabling
the following .config items:
	CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB
	CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_FREECOM
	CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_ISD200
	CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DPCM
	CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_HP8200e
	CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_SDDR09
	CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_JUMPSHOT
thanks,
greg k-h
