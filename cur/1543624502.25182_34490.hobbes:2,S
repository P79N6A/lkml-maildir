Hi,
I first noticed the problem on my Amiga, but I can reproduce it on an ia32
machine, when I turn off dma with hdparm. After a while the driver stops
working with:
hda: lost interrupt
After rebooting e2fsck has some serious damage to repair, so the driver
even writes garbage back to disk before stopping.
I can reproduce the problem pretty easily (some disk activity like from a
kernel compile is already enough) and it happens on two completely
different systems, so it should be reproducable on other systems too.
bye, Roman
