The newer io schedulers divide the queue into a front and backend, so
it's not exactly trivial to just 'leave it on the queue'. Which queue?
You know which ones are pending, they are on the busy queue. You can
look there.

Agree

Basically everyone agrees that this shouldn't happen in newer disks, I'm
inclined to think we are seeing internal queueing bugs in the SCSI
drivers or SCSI layer itself.

Who said we are using an elevator? News flash, we haven't used an
elevator design for a long time.
