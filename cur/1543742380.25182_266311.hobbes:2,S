I suspect that your laptop uses SMM traps to talk to the battery.  That
could certainly explain the 700 us xruns, because SMM disables all
interrupts.  This was covered recently in another thread.  According to
Alan Cox most laptops work this way.
Has anyone been able to reproduce the problem on a desktop system?
