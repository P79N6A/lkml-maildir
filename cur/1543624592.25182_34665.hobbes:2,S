The name "linux/compiler.h" does not imply that to me, nor do the 
comments in the file, which are related specifically to __ builtin_expect.
RELOC_HIDE is a potentially general facility (with the caveat below), 
that does not seem to directly relate to the name "linux/percpu.h" at 
all, except by happenstance due to its origins.  Subjectively it seemed 
to me that compiler.h was the most appropriate.  Maybe kernel.h is a 
better choice, in others' eyes.  But I think percpu.h is probably the 
wrong home.

Will other arches -ever- use the macro?  If not, include/asm-ppc is a 
better place...
