Can you give a bit more details about your build setup.
I cannot reproduce it here and I tried several combinations of
-j values and ways to specify what to build.
I would at least like to see all lines preceeding this on in your
build log so I get an understanding what happened just before you hit this.
It looks like make started updating the aic7xxx_reg.h file but failed to
finsih the job before it started building aic7xxx_proc.c so the build
of aic7xxx_proc.c picked up a half written .h file.
