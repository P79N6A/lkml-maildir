That's a _guess_.

It would take days.

No. The CVS archive is going to be almost the same size. BKCVS gets about 
98% of all the data. It just doesn't show the complex merge graphs, but 
those are "small" in comparison.

I think it's entirely reasonable, yes. But I may be off by an order of
magnitude. I based the 3GB on estimating form the sparse tree, but I
wasn't being too careful. Andrew estimated 2GB per year (at our current
historical rate of changes) based on my merge with him. So it's in that 
general range of 3-6GB, I htink.
