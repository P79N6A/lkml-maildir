mhh, i also think framebuffer would be nice, but the main idea behind my 
posting is have some recent linux kernel up and running without any effort - 
with main focus on kernel, not on apps.
sure, it would be nice to have X for the unexperienced users, but if you run 
uml and get networking up and running, you just do ssh -X into your uml and 
then you have your X. those people who run the latest kernel for testing 
special things are not unexperienced, but having a packaged kernel+rootfs 
"ready to run" would also make _their_ life easier.  think of testing 
several kernels in parallel to find/fix regressions.
booting into something graphical with kdm/gdm login, firefox inside etc 
would be really nice, but that would be probably overkill for the purpose it 
should serve. framebuffer and X could be added later to uml, and i`m sure, 
it will exist one day.
btw - i think besides that packaged uml+rootfs, the same thing could be 
distributed in other formats, i.e. qemu, vmware, M$ virtual pc (add your 
favourite v12n solution here)
