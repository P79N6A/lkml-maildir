Which works until the next rev of the kernel at which point the patch may
not be valid any more.

No, it was mostly just pointing out that it was possible to do with kbuild
and CML2 in O(patch) rather than O(whole kernel). Testing applicability of
the patch is 80% of the work.

Up to whoever $maintainer happens to be. If DaveM runs a patch queue
the answer probably includes Sparc, otherwise it defaults to x86. The
config question was answered in my original proposal.

Actually my answer is perfectly to the point: clearly you know exactly why
someone would keep harping on about a patch management solution no one
seems very interested in, so I hardly need to spell it out for you. But
I can add some details:
- Linus has limited bandwidth, and as is becoming clear, so do the
  other maintainers
- dropped patches are the primary indicator of this
- people don't implement exponential back-off well, they tend to get
  cranky instead
- feedback is a good way to reduce congestion and resends
- the old solution, Jitterbug, was horrid
