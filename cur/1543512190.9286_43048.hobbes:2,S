Um, with devfs you do not need a user space daemon, so that daemon does
not need to keep track of all the changes to the /dev directory, which
promptly renders the rest of the argument irrelevent.
If the user plugs in a USB modem, the user knows they plugged in a modem,
they run their getty/pppd/minicom on the new modem device.
I personally think devfsd is a major mistake. Those who do not
use it assume that its features are limited to a set that can
apparently be addressed with an rc script. They also assume that
it is necessary to use devfs.
I use devfs, I do not use devfsd.  
I gain what appear like benefits to me from using devfs without devfsd.
I might gain even more if I were to install devfsd, I might not.
