I guess the one I wrote for staircase is inadequate too. Although in the 
field the implementation has been safe as far as I can tell.
I'm thinking of holding off for a bit to allow those current changes to 
be tried in -mm for a bit.
I have two more questions - there are already userspace tools and older 
out-of-tree kernels (inluding my current one) that use SCHED_BATCH and 
SCHED_ISO.
Should we respect the values for these policies and use numbering 
consistent with them (meaning SCHED_BATCH at 3 would be reserved but not 
used) or should we dish out values according to when they're implemented 
and demand userspace be updated.
Should we move to a policy bitmask numbering system and/or make 
SCHED_CPUBOUND, SCHED_ISO etc subpolicies of SCHED_NORMAL?
