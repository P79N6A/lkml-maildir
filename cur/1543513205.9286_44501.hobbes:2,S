Well the source for this is over my head, which is why I looked
at the docs...  I'm just trying to understand all the proc items
to determine which ones can legitimately be used for localized
system optimization on workstations, servers, busy websites,
etc..  and which are just fluff, or whatnot.
Thanks for pointing out this one for me!  Do you have any
suggestions as to which proc entries might actually do something
optimal if tweaked?  The vm stuff I figured would, but I'm not
sure what is safe to touch, and what is not, and the
documentation says that you can hose stuff if you aren't sure...
IMHO it should protect against situations like that, but I can't
complain running a free kernel.  ;o)
Thanks for the info!
