I have a Red Hat linux 6.0 box (Celeron 433Mhz, not overclocked!, with
196M RAM and a IBM 6.4G IDE, on a Abit ZM6) on a remote network.  Every 5
or so days, it used to lose eth0 (3c509) and no packets would come in or
out, despite the fact that the box was still up.  Rebooting fixes the
problem, Rebooting every 3 or so days kept the problem from occuring at
all.
I upgraded to the 6.1 Kernel (no other rpms) to find that it would still
happen, only now about every 12 days.
It just happened again.  I can't get to the box till tommorow, but I was
wondering what info I need collect and pass on to you guys to diagnose the
cause of this problem.
Since the box doesn't crash, there is no oops.
All of the boxes contents are brand new, but I don't have an identical NIC
one to swap it out with. None of the other boxes on that hub are having
this problem.
Let me know how to proceed please...
