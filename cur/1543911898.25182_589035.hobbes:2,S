I'd change the description to
current_is_keventd() is a stupid load of crap.  It does
int current_is_keventd(void)
{
	struct cpu_workqueue_struct *cwq;
	int cpu = smp_processor_id();	/* preempt-safe: keventd is per-cpu */
but that comment (and the code itself) only make sense when
current_is_keventd() is called by keventd.  In which case thers is no point
in the function even existing!
We need to use raw_smp_processor_id() so that non-keventd (or, more
specifically, non-pinned-to-one-cpu) callers won't generate "using
smp_processor_id() in preemptible" warnings.
