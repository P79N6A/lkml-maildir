the amount of potentially affected code (assuming all the locking is 
done in a single .[ch] file) is even smaller:
  kernel/posix-cpu-timers.c
  kernel/exit.c
  kernel/posix-timers.c
  include/linux/sched.h
checked these, we dont seem to do that.

this reminds me about the patch below: it gets rid of tasklist_lock use 
in the POSIX timer signal delivery critical path.

yeah.

dont use the tasklist_lock in the POSIX timer-delivery critical path.
