The 48-bit support was acutally only a small of the originalreason for
extents, while it seems to be the most popular right now.  The other
issues that are being addressed are:
- performance issues like avoiding 0.1%+ indirect block metadata overhead
  for each file which is bad for the cache, and also hurts unlinks)
- the extent index blocks are also more robust than indirect blocks (they
  have a magic and internally verifiable structure, and the possibility
  to easily add metadata checksums and extent->inode backpointers to
  allow improved filesystem checking).  With large ext3 filesystems the
  {d,t,}indirect blocks can have random garbage in them and there is no
  way for the kernel to know unless it overlaps with other fixed metadata
- the ability to do things like preallocation of files efficiently (via
  uninitialized extents), instead of zero-filling the whole file.

I think this is a great idea, and one that is very similar to what
we are doing with ext3 filesystems in Lustre.  There is definitely
a desire to harden the ext3 code in many ways against such failures,
and being able to check independent parts of the filesystem is a
very desirable part of this.

This needs some extra data in the directory entry, which I've already
been thinking about for ext3, so if you are looking at implementing
this for ext3 I'd be happy to share some ideas.

Put on your asbestos vest before suggesting any changes to ext2 :-).

While fast recovery is one aspect of ext3 journaling, the other one
is that this allows multiple filesystem changes to be made atomically
and they are rolled back as a set if the system crashes in the middle.

I look forward to it.
