A problem at this point may be that a AT-keyboard doesn't spit out ASCII
but Scan-Codes, so a serial device spitting out ASCII would have to be
put into the loop AFTER the stage that makes conversions, or you would
have to convert ASCII back to Scan-Codes before.
Btw. I'm not normaly into barcode-scanning, but for something at work i
tried a USB-scanner (From Symbol AFAIR) to see what is stored in the
barcodes that are on the prints that i have to generate. The scanner
just registered as a plain HID-device, which resulted in the data
comming as key-presses. It was just "Plug & Play", i didn't need any
software or anything else. I just plugged the device in, opened a
text-editor to catch the data, then i scanned the bar-codes and was
happy. :-)
So if you aren't nailed to a serial scanner, you just may try a USB-scanner.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated,
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
