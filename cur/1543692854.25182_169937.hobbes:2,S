Correct. But this lock is going to be a huge bottleneck.

Per connection sounds like a much better answer, assuming you can
guarantee that SendReceive() never gets called simultaneously on the
same connection.

No, it's generally a good idea, but the allocation of tfms means that
conversion isn't necessarily straightforward.
