Subject: [PATCH] mm/slab.c remove impossible <0 check - size_t is not signed - patch is against 2.6.1-rc1-mm2

In mm/slab.c in the function kmem_cache_create, there's a check for
'offset < 0' that is completely unnessesary since 'offset' is of
type size_t, and size_t is an unsigned datatype in all archs.
The patch below removes this un-needed code - even gcc agrees that this
code is not needed and that case can never happen.

Patch is compile tested, that's all - but it seems to be 'obviously
correct' to me.
Kind regards,

PS. CC'ing the people mentioned in the comments of mm/slab.c since I
couldn't fine any single person responsible for this file in MAINTAINERS -
hope that's OK.
