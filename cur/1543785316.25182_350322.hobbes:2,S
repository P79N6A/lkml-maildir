Subject: [patch 2.6.14-rc1] pci: only call pci_restore_bars at boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Certain (SGI?) ia64 boxes object to having their PCI BARs
restored unless absolutely necessary. This patch restricts calling
pci_restore_bars from pci_set_power_state unless the current state
is PCI_UNKNOWN, the actual (i.e. physical) state of the device is
PCI_D3hot, and the device indicates that it will lose its configuration
when transitioning to PCI_D0.

Many thanks to Keith Owens <kaos@sgi.com> for a) narrowing-down the
problem; and, b) quickly testing the fix and reporting the results.
