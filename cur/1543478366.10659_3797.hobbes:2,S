Hi Kernel-Hackers,
since many releases of the 2.1 kernel and still in the 2.2 kernel I get
upon
bootup
hda.........................ATAPI Unknown (type 14) device
The device in question is a CD-ROM drive, type CDU711.
The machine is a 2 x PentiumII @ 400MHz Tyan S1836DLUAN with
an extra EEpro100 board. All disks are SCSI except for the CD-ROM
which is the primary master on the IDE interface.
Oh, needless to say that I can't see the CD-ROM drive from
within Linux.
Thanx,
         Andres
