Do you get different numbers if you boot with:
elevator=as
elevator=deadline
elevator=cfq  (for -mm kernels)
elevator=noop
(You may need to build a kernel with these configured - the symbols are:
CONFIG_IOSCHED_NOOP=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_AS=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_DEADLINE=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ=y  (-mm kernels only)
and can be selected in the 'General Setup' menu - they should all be
built by default unless you've selected EMBEDDED).
