Yes, I had this in -mm for ages, seem to have lost it.  Also removal of BKL
from lseek().
The theory is that the lock is there to avoid f_pos races against lseek.  We
ended up deciding that the way to address this is to ensure that all readdir
implementations do:
foo_readdir()
{
	loff_t pos = file->f_pos;
	....
	<code which doesn't touch file->f_pos, but which modifies pos>
	...
	file->f_pos = pos;
}
ext2 does this right and does not need the lock_kernel().  Once all
filesystems have been audited (and, if necessary, fixed) we can remove the
BKL from lseek also.
