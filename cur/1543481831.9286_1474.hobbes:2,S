Well, I tracked down the problem to the call to down_interruptible() around
line 1974 in scsi_error_handler() in scsi_error.c.
Part of the patch from pre7 to pre8 were all those Alpha semaphore
fixes.  I wasn't able to boot until you posted your semaphore patch.  Since
then I've always gotten this oops.  Apparently something in the semaphore
code still isn't right.
Let me know if you want me to instrument the code more to help you isolate the
bug.
