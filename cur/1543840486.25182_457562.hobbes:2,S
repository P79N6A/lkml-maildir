Very interesting approach. I wonder if it could be used to cover
another problematic source of latencies as well: asynchronous SMIs.
They quickly cause delays reaching from a few 100 us up to
milliseconds.
Hard-RT extension like Xenomai work around this on several Intel
chipsets by disabling SMI unconditionally (compile-time configurable).
But maybe this could be done in a smarter fashion in mainline
directly. It would likely take some practical boundary (SMI latencies
are fairly board / bios dependent) and a place to put the simple check
    if (system_latency_constraint() < SMI_LATENCY) disable_smi();
Maybe vendors will provide more information on SMI-related latencies,
how to avoid them, and what side effects exist once an infrastrure is
there.
If there is some common interest in this direction, I would try to
spend time on working out a patch based on your infrastructure and our
current material in Xenomai. Or is there already something planned in
this direction?

I guess an interface to let also applications / the sysadmin specifiy
a latency constraint would be useful as well. sysfs?
