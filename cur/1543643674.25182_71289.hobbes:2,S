Looking at the driver files, this is interesting:
	dmusic.sys
	gm16.dls
	kmixer.sys
	ks.sys
	ksclockf.ax
	ksdata.ax
	ksinterf.ax
	ksproxy.ax
	kstvtune.ax
	ksuser.dll
	ksvpintf.ax
	kswdmcap.ax
	ksxbar.ax
	msh263.drv
	mskssrv.sys
	mspclock.sys
	portcls.sys
	redbook.sys
redbook? isn't that CD related?
	sbemul.sys
	stream.sys
	swmidi.sys
	sysaudio.sys
	usbaudio.sys
	vfwwdm.drv
	vfwwdm32.dll
	wdmaud.drv
	wdmaud.sys
I also see a lot of audio related files like usbaudio, sbemul,gm16,
swmidi, and dmusic.
Mark, are there any other interfaces in the output form lsusb?
I didn't see them in dmesg from the connection. But the windows drivers
make me think there should be a usb-audio interface.
