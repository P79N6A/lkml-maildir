I don't expect so - if it doesn't print anything useful to the console
we're rather stuck.  You probably don't have a serial port.  If you have a
lan port then netconsole _might_ work, but I'd say it's unlikely.
Dunno.  You _might_ be able to get a better trace by changing settings such
as CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER, CONFIG_4KSTACKS, CONFIG_UNWIND_INFO, and
CONFIG_DEBUG_*.
