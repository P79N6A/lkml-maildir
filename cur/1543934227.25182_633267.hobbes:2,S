I guess that makes sense. I guess people can always be referred to LKML
for the issues where the appropriate person isn't on linux-pm.

Hmm. I've had too many things going through my little brain since then.
What I currently have is support for freezing fuse filesystems
separately. It looks like:
int freeze_processes(void)
{
        int error;
        printk("Stopping fuse filesystems.\n");
        freeze_filesystems(FS_FREEZER_FUSE);
        freezer_state = FREEZER_FILESYSTEMS_FROZEN;
        printk("Freezing user space processes ... ");
        error = try_to_freeze_tasks(FREEZER_USER_SPACE);
        if (error)
                goto Exit;
        printk("done.\n");
        sys_sync();
        printk("Stopping normal filesystems.\n");
        freeze_filesystems(FS_FREEZER_NORMAL);
        freezer_state = FREEZER_USERSPACE_FROZEN;
        printk("Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... ");
        error = try_to_freeze_tasks(FREEZER_KERNEL_THREADS);
        if (error)
                goto Exit;
        printk("done.");
        freezer_state = FREEZER_FULLY_ON;
 Exit:
        BUG_ON(in_atomic());
        printk("\n");
        return error;
}
(I'm not yet worrying about ext3 on fuse or such like, but it shouldn't
be hard to extend the model to do that).
