Could you possibly take a look at the kernel BUG that I got Friday night on 
the 2.4.19 kernel, to see if it (oh god please) hopefully points in a 
useful direction?
http://castandcrew.com/~gregory/lkmlstuff/burpr/2.4.19
The files are:
burpr-kernel-bug.20030314.2100 (the raw bug)
burpr-kernel-bug.20030314.2100.ksymoops (processed through ksymoops)
FYI, the amaivschk program listed in the BUG is a shell script, and also at 
that URL if you're curious as to what it does.
Thanks again...
