It is possible. But it is hard to track, as it works with serial console,
and it is not possible to paint characters to VGA screen, as vgacon uses
hardware panning instead of scrolling :-( And if it dies, shift-pageup
apparently does not work... And filling whole 32KB with some char
does not work, as it changes timing too much...

No, I'll try. It occured with either AGP (Matrox G200/G400/G450) or
PCI (S3, CL5434) VGA adapter. I did not tried real ISA VGA...

Yes. I could understand if I had to place bigger udelay() after INIT IPI,
as this can cause some specific PIII initialization and Intel says that
there should not be any MESI traffic during this init (at least I understand
it that way). But after startup IPI it should just start executing code...
I tried to put 'wbinvd' here and there, but it did not make any change,
only udelay() between startup IPI cmd and first printk() did.

I have no idea. I know that board has VT82C694X (rev c4) host and PCI bridge,
and VT82C686 (rev 22) ISA bridge. I tried to request documentation
of 694X from VIA, but I did not heard from them. They have probably
some secrets hidden in their hardware...
