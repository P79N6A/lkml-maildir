-mm will be (and now is)
origin.patch
linux-next.patch
<other patches>
Where "other patches" includes git trees which aren't in linux-next.
So yes, you should drop #for-mm and add #for-next.
I will pull your #for-next brach daily, but I'll only include it (as
git-ieee1394.patch) if for some reason linux-next.patch needed to be
dropped.
