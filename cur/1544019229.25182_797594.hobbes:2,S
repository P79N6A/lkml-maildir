That is correct, I just built/booted/tested a series of kernels one
after the other as part of the standard git bisect procedure.  No
tools were changed.

This feature of crash does not work with 2.6.29, nor does it work with
any kernel I've tried >= 2.6.21.  Andi Kleen shared with me that he
sees the same problem with a recent crash and 2.6.28.
AFAIK I found the regression point relative to linux (commit:
7460ed28).  The verdict is clearly still out on where the actual bug
lives (linux vs crash).
