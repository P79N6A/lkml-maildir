It is not rocket science to populate a chroot environment with enough
files to make many interesting applications work.  Don't expect a general
solution---chroot is not a silver bullet---but it is useful.  (Note also
that whether you can populate a chroot environment sufficiently is roughly
independent of whether you called chroot(2) with root privileges or not.)
