Just the fact that you are using much bigger free queue sizes now means
that the batching in itself has less of an effect than with the smaller
queue sizes (here it's absolutely vital to get good merging).

Could be, I'd inclined to think that FIFO behaviour would aid the
batching as well. Remember that we have had FIFO wakups there before, so
that's not entirely new.

I think that would be best, I'll wait for numbers though :-). To be
honest, batch counts of eg 256 just sounds a bit insane to me.
