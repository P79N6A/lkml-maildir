Could you chmod user.log and vmstat.log for us?
There are a few things you should try - you probably already have:
- Stop all applications, restart them
- Unload net driver module, reload and reconfigure it.
If either of those (or similar operations) are found to bring the latency
back to normal then that would be a big hint.  ie: we need to find
something which brings the performance back apart from a complete reboot.
Also, look out for consistent increases in either urer or system CPU time.
