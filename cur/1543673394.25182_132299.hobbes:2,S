kernel version: 2.5.69-bk7,
hardware: hp omnibook 6100, i830m
the kernel boots (which is a huge improvement compared to older
releases, thanks), but i get the attached error.
After the system is booted there's a interessting situation, some parts
of acpi seem to be loaded (i have /proc/thermal_zone et al (shoudn't it
be /proc/acpi/* ?)), but they don't work.
The interessting bootup lines (apic is disabled):
| ACPI: RSDP (v000 PTLTD                      ) @ 0x000f6610
