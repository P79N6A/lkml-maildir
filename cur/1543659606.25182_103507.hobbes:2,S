Subject: [BK PATCH] TTY changes for 2.5.58
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some minor tty patches.  They add a struct module to the
tty_driver structure and then increment and decrement the driver's
reference when the tty device assigned to that driver is in use.  This
is much like other subsystems do.
This patch was posted to lkml and no one objected to it.
I've also included a patch that adds this support to the tty drivers in
the drivers/usb/ directory.

  TTY: add module reference counting for tty drivers.
  
  Note, there are still races with unloading modules, this patch
  does not fix that...
