Yeap, that's what we believe and this very tiny contribution is, as
far as I can see,
orthogonal to you work and we are willing to complement it with more
experiments.

Ok. We already started checking that and we will give you a feed back soon.

Yes, indeed. I agree you and other guys on this respect. It is just
that sometimes
small stones inside our shoes cause greater damage in the long run than
the big ones we've just faced. All othe problems are like the big ones, and
we took the path to remove the small ones first.

Ok, I realise this may look too philosophical to other folks in this list but
just for the sake of reality Linux is going to mobility nowadays. No one
denies that. What for? There are certainly better answers then mines, but
we hope to allow the freedom of choosing for the application you want to 
have just on the palm of hand, for affordable prices and fair competition.
This is not new, sorry about that.
Taking this into account, who holds the semantics of the importance of
applications running but the user of a mobile device? Is it the kernel? Who is
the admin?

For sure there are certain levels of security that operators and 
manufacturers wnat to have and they warn us what we can and we can't do.
Just like with easy-to-use consumer electronic products. Again, nothing new.

Yes, your'e absolutely right. The userland tuning is just the part that will
allow, let's say, a user profile-based policy of ranking, and this may have
impact on such patterns of memory consuption, or rate allocation if you like.
