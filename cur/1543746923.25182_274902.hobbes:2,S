Ouch... Shame on me, I never realized that this is a problem. I knew
that swapping over nbd does not work, but I did not realize that
writeout is as critical as swapping...
:-(. This means that read/write nbd is pretty bad idea. I wonder why
it is not broken for people? Probably noone uses so big ammount of
data over nbd...
Can you describe that solution? You can do it anonymously if you want
to ;-)))).
