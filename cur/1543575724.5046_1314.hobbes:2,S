Subject: insmod problem after modutils upgrading

i've upgraded modutils from 2.3.14 (originally installed by RH7,kernel
2.2.16) to 2.3.22 using "rpm -Fvh modultils2.3.22-1.i386.rpm*" as required
by the kernel 2.4test12 compilation. after upgrading, the network module
refused to load anymore (was working fine with insmod 2.3.14) with kernel
2.2.16/RH7. during boot process, the following error message was shown:
insmod: /lib/modules/2.4.0-test12/kernel/drivers/net/8139too.o insmod eth0
failed.
executing "insmod 8139too" at the command prompt shows the following error
message:
using /lib/modules/2.4.0-test12/kernel/drivers/net/8139too.o
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test12/kernel/drivers/net/8139too.o: symbol for
parameter debug not found.
pls kindly advise if i've done something wrong during the upgrade or are
there known compatibility issues with modutils 2.3.22?
how can i make insmod load the network module again pls?
thanks.
