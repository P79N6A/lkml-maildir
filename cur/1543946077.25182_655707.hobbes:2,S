I don't think that BUG_ON() should be there. It should probably printk a 
warning but certainly not crash the whole machine.

That's bad. It just works with de4x5 with any cable at any time.

de4x5 has no MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE for PCI devices anymore, so no conflicts. 
That's probably good for cards that work with tulip driver but bad for mine 
card and also probably for some other cards that (should) work with de2104x.

Great, it looks to be 6 years old and it's still experimental. Probably 
because it never worked properly.
I think that de2104x driver should be removed (or at least its 
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE) and MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE with only 21040 and 21041 PCI 
IDs added to de4x5.
I can send a patch if this is acceptable.
