   Yes. The basic design principle Linux uses wrt. mice is "don't put
to the kernel what needn't be there". This leads to only the basic
communication protocols being built in the kernel and the rest
done in userland by the gpm daemon.

   A meta-question: What has a graphics library to do with keyboard
and mouse? IMHO graphics and input processing are totally different
tasks which should be done in separate libraries.

   This is a bogus argument leading to decisions like `using the C
library is not suitable because some systems don't have the version
I use installed'.

   What is the real scan code? Are you willing to handle zillions of
existing keyboards on all architectures and parse their strange
sequences of scan codes?

   It's unwise to use the RAW mode as the scancodes are _very_
hardware-dependent. Better use the medium raw mode which just gives
_key_codes_ with up/down flags.

   I don't see any argument why this should really be handled in the
kernel. IMHO the better way is to design a library for processing of
input events and make all programs use this library.
   Currently, a event-based input layer for Linux is under development,
but it surely won't get to 2.2 kernels. In this code, at least partial
event processing will be done in the kernel, but it's still an open
question how serial mice will be handled.
				Have a nice fortnight
