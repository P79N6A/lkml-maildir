Pavel what mail client are you using?  The last comment
reads:
+ *    (plus it causes oops and I'm lazy<CTRL-H><CTRL-H><CTRL-H><CTRL-H>too busy).
I spelled out the ^H so you can see them, that is how
the comment looks to me.  The word 'lazy' is still in
there along with too busy, you never backspaced over
the lazy in the comment.  That's all :P
