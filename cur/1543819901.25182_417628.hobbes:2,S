The bad news is my test case, compiled with a native gcc version 3.4.4
and binutils version 2.16.1 doesn't work as expected.  So maybe it's
combination of gcc/binutils?  I'm booting the new kernel just to confirm
that 3.4.4 and 2.16.1 do not work.
FWIW, the cross-compiler environment was made of gcc 4.1.0 and binutils
2.16.1.
