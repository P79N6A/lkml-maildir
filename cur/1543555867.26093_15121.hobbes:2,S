When Linus puts out pre3 I will start sending him stuff from my tree which
proves workable. Stuff that seems suspect and needs more work I'll keep in
the -ac tree and continue to release it against current Linus code. 
It doesnt cause me any problem if you send Linus a copy, I'll just drop it
from my patches as it appears in his tree.
