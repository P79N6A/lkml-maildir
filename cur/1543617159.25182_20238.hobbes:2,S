So can we assume that our dear sweet Penelope has spent a bit of time
reading l-k and finding out about <insert your favorite brown-paper-bag
release here>?  We wouldn't want her to destroy her newly-created data.
Also, since she has a laptop (which comes with all that finicky laptop
hardware), does the release of the kernel she grabbed have that nasty
tweak that fries the board in her laptop?  (I've heard some rather nasty
horror stories, that's why I ask)
She can't very well patch her vendor kernel, because I sincerely doubt
the patch will apply cleanly, if this driver is such that it needs a
patch as opposed to just a module.
Also, what do we tell Penelope when her other piece of exotic hardware
that *was* supported in the vendor kernel, but isn't supported in the
vanilla kernel, stops working.  Suddenly she can do her advanced biology
stuff, but can't print, or dial up w/ her winmodem, or whatever.

If Penelope is even a remote candidate for this scenario, I think
penguin-boy is already impressed ;-)
