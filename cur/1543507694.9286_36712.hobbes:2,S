PAGE_OFFSET itself isn't exported. hmm, if you know what you're
doing i guess you could play games like in the attached example module ;)
(i only tried this on 2.3.12)
//gcc -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -Wall -D__KERNEL__=1 -DMODULE=1 -I/usr/src/linux/include/ -c kpo.c
//insmod ./kpo.o
#include <asm/segment.h>
#include <asm/current.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/sched.h>
EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS;
#undef PAGE_OFFSET
unsigned long PAGE_OFFSET;
int init_module(void)
{
   //PAGE_OFFSET = find_task_by_pid(1)->addr_limit.seg;
   PAGE_OFFSET = current->addr_limit.seg;
   printk( KERN_DEBUG "PAGE_OFFSET=0x%08lx\n", PAGE_OFFSET );
   
   return -1;
}
void cleanup_module(void)
{
}
