   Well, can then anyone explain by which mean (black magic?) kernel 
mounts root file system? block device might appear any time, file system 
might take ages to load.
   Hu? How is init/do_mounts.c still works then? Or it is needs to be 
fixed with messages a-la "root file system will be available shortly, we 
do hope" and "please plug in again your hard-wired IDE drive"?
   People, you must learn doing abstractions carefully. If device is 
hard-wired - user *will* expect (as kernel itself does) that it is 
available all the time after modprobe'ing driver.
