Just in case, this is the script which can be used to generate patches
to fix whitespace in the tree. Unmodified script fixes only trailing ws
in printks and therefore ~250 generated patches have some chance of
acceptance.
Script has commented out code to fix all kinds of ws misuse.
If enabled, it produces nearly 50 MB worth of patches.
