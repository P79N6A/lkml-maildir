As long as it uses some sort of "module plugin" approach, perhaps coupled to
the firmware loader system to avoid wasting a ton of space with tables for
processors other than the one you need...  you could just move all of the
hardware-related parts of perfmon lib into the kernel.
That would close the doors to non-gpl badness.
