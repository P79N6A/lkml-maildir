Hello,
Tomorrow I'll do a presentation about Linux, and I'd like to print a good
resolution picture of Tux, which should fill a letter size sheet (8.5" x
11").
Does anyone know where I can find one ?!?! The ones I've found are too
small, and when "exploded" to letter size lose a lot of resolution ... :(
Thanks in advance for your help !!
Regards,
Ivan
