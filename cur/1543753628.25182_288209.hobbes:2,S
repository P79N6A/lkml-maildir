That depends on the driver. input_dev is in general a static entry in 
the driver-dependend structure, which in turn may be statically or 
dynamically allocated (depending on whether the driver allows for more 
than one instance of the device to be connected).
Would dynamic allocation be of any help here?
I must admit that reference counting in sysfs is still a somewhat 
darkish grey box to me.

Of course. I didn't see another way, as already stated the originial 
input events were something of a misnomer.
So either I had to change the existing sysfs layout by renaming the 
current 'input' class and retain compability with the events
or change the event types and retain compability with the sysfs layout.
I opted for the latter, as AFAIK more userland tools might be reading 
from sysfs than processing hotplug events.
Cheers,
Hannes
