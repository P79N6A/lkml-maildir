i tried it about a month back with -test11.  my quad ppro simply
locked up and died when i issued "iptables -nL".  i got no logs just a
freeze.  perhaps only my keyboard mouse and NIC died and the rest of
the machine kept on running.  i posted a couple of times to the
netfilter mailing list but got zero response.
