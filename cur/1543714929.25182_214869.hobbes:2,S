Quick story is that what I sent is (what I believe) to be the bare
minimum change to restore correctnes.
I'll start arguing with people to make sure bugfixes start moving and
cleanups start waiting.
Paul, please remove akpm from the cc: list in future replies until we
have come to a consensus and get this nailed down (hopefully ASAP) to
a coherent cross-vendor story.
What I believe I have sent is the bare minimum change, with no cleanups
or semantic changes. If you could review and/or send approval or the
like that would be very helpful for the users of small SMP systems who
are affected by the bug(s) you reported.
