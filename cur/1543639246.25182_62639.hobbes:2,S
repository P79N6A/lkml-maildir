Do you have any objection to this boot time reservation stuff going in
for now as a cPCI only thing?  I can imagine other solutions that use
DMI scans or the like to detect cPCI master cards and grab chunks of the
resource space(s) for the hotswap buses, but don't have any clever ideas
on reliable heuristics for knowing how big those chunks should be for a
given card.
