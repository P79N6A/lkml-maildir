The f* variant can be race free. For example you want to stat something
first to make sure it is what you expect it to be and not a symlink
to your /etc/passwd. When you use first stat() and then do random
operation on filename with name there is a small window where someone
could replace the name with something else. This could be security relevant.
fd = open(name, ...); fstat(fd, ..); check fsomething(fd, ...); close(fd);
guarantees that you're always working on the same object without any race 
windows.
