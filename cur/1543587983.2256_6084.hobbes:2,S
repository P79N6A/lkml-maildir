Sorry if this problem has already been disscussed.
I run an linux box with a HD 30Go/reiserfs .
I tried several 2.4 kernel ( 2.4.2 , 2.4.3 , 2.4.4-pre3 , 2.4.3-ac7)
After a random time I've got a fs problem which lead to :
-first a segfault of a process which reads/writes on the partition
ex:
[jal@skippy prog]$ ./configure
....
ln -s dialects/linux/machine.h machine.h
Erreur de segmentation ( SEGFAULT )
-and then the partition freeze .Any attempt to read/write on it leads to
put the process in a D state and makes it unkillable.

I will try with ac9 but I'm not really sure of the result..
