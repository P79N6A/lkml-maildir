I agree that works fine for Oracle, that's becase Oracle is an extreme
special case since most of this shared memory is an I/O cache, this is
not the case of other apps, and those other apps really depends on the
kernel vm paging algorithms for things more than istantiating a pte (or
a pmd if it's a largepage). Other apps can't use mlock. Some of these
apps works closely with oracle too.
dropping pte_chains through mlock was suggested around april 2003
originally by Wli and I didn't like that idea since we really want to
allow swapping if we run short of ram. And it doesn't solve the
scalability slowdown on the 32-way for kernel compiles either.
