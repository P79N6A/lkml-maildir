This bug has been seen here over eight years ago and it is back.. linux
2.6.0-test4 is still not cat proof :-)
I found my cat asleep on the warm laptop, it is winter here, and the
keyboard was dead. Mouse still works, but I had to reboot before I could use
the keyboard again. Restarting X, which I could do with the mouse, did not
help.
But I'm willing to live with this problem :-) Not sure if I want to debug
this, my previous laptop turned out to be filled with hair too. She never
lies on the keyboard when I'm at home!
Thought you'd want to know,
	bert.
