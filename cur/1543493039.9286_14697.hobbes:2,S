Hi,
You said recently:

For kernel debugging and kernel memory browsing there is a multitude of
tools:
1. KDB Built-in Kernel Debugger:
http://reality.sgi.com/slurn_engr/
2. IKD Integrated Kernel Debugging Facilities:
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/patch-ikd-arca/
3. KME Kernel Memory Editor
http://robertl.freeservers.com/kme/
4. Use ye olde gdb(1) on /proc/kcore_elf
(by David Howells). I don't know where he keeps the original patch but
there is a copy on my webpage:
http://www.aivazian.demon.co.uk/patches/elf-kcore-2.2.5.patch.gz
5. Put lots of printk() around the code you modified and behold your own
"pseudo-debugger" :)
Regards,
