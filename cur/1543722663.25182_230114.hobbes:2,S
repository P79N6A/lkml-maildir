Agreed - the above was just to give intro to the concept.

Agreed again - using >> would do the trick here.
The idea was to have a common way for external modules to detect
certain API changes, type changes etc. that would cause the build
to fail otherwise.
Also the code fragment shown were supposed to be part of the
external modules - not the main steram kernel.

That practice would be nice.
