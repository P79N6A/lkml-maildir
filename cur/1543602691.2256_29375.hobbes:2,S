It's working for me.  I have loaded up three X sessions, and bunches
of software running.  My 500 MHz PIII with 192 MB of RAM and 255 MB of
swap in current use is certainly willing to take some time if I try to
get from one X session to another.  And some Netscape windows seem
stubborn about refreshing, but I think it's looking good.
Having been a complainer, I hereby say it seems fixed.
-kb, the Kent who of course had to put the preemption patch in there
too.
