Do you mean userspace irqbalance daemon?
It might need to be modified to work properly with a new and unusual 
event source.
Also, for some irq events, it may be good to send most interrupts to one 
core/CPU.  That enhances caching effects, among other benefits.  Again, 
this is highly dependent on the event source, I'm not saying that is the 
case here.
