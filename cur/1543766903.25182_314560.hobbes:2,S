ok. Generally overmounts are done on the root dentry of the topmost
vfsmount.  But in this case, your patch mounts it on the same dentry
as that of the private mount.
Essentially I was always under the assertion that 'a dentry can hold
only one vfsmount'.  But invisible mount seem to invalidate that
assertion.  Don't see any bad effects of that.  Probably some VFS
experts may. (or probably my assertion is wrong to begin with)
