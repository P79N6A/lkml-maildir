Having written such a niche event based server, I can 100% confirm what 
Ingo is saying here.  We had a single process drive I/O to the kernel 
through an event model (based on kernel aio extended with IO_CMD_POLL), 
and user level threads managed by a custom scheduler that managed I/O, 
timeouts, and thread scheduling.
We once considered dropping from a user-level thread model to a state 
machine model, but the effort was astronomical and we wouldn't see the 
rewards until it was all done, so naturally we didn't do it.

Yes.  Threadlets as the default aio solution (easy to use, acceptable 
performance even in worst cases), with specialized solutions where 
applicable (epoll for networking, aio for O_DIRECT disk) look like a 
good mix of performance and sanity.
