The idea of an optical mouse is nothing new: I've got an optical mouse
sitting to the side of my keyboard as we speak, dated ::turns mouse
over:: 1987. Produced for Sun Microsystems by Mouse Systems. Microsoft
being innovative? Hell no... They stole that idea from someone else, as
they have for decades (and will undoubtedly continue to do). It also
wouldn't surprise me if MS is mimicing someone else's idea with the
wheel... I can remember purchasing a Logitech mouse with that wheel long
before I had seen a Micros~1 equivalent.
