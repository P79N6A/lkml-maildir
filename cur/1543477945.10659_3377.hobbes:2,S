The issue seems to be the tulip v0.90 is said to have problems
on machines where the older ones work.
But also a known issue is that tulips older than v0.90 do not
work reasonably at all for several clone chipsets, including
Macronix. At least in the Macronix case this is only
an issue about correctly initializing some of the chips registers.
So a moderate low risk solution would be to "backport"
the clone init business to the older tulip. Risk should
be low as only the init routines need to be touched.
But since noone commented on that I didn't do anything.
