Well, I didn't know obviously, now I know.

I tried at first...
Now I did it again:
1. Login on VT2
2. less /etc/services
3. switch to X (VT8 here) and do something
4. switch back to VT2
5. press Shift+PgUp
6. press Up, then press several times Shift+PgUp
What is expected:
screen should not scroll past the beginnign of /etc/services.
What happens:
I saw a bunch of garbage plus pieces of text (/etc/shadow form previous tests and so on), this is a security flaw, NOT feature.

No, I thought you were right, I was just trying to produce a simple testcase :-(
What I was trying ot prove with my testcase is that
a) if you are using mingetty
AND
b) you switch VT after logout (pressing Alt+Right a few times)
the above mentioned scroll-back flow is not observed.
Ok, after tons of new tries, I reproduced it...
I was thinking that every VT has its own scrollback buffer and you are supposed to see what has been on a given VT.
Now I see that you can see things that have been printed on _other_ VTs :-)
I confirm the bug.
There is no connection with {a,min}getty it seems.
Kalin.
