folx,
on 2.4.0-test6 i got a bunch of the following log messages and then the
console went dead (well, power-saving monitor and no amount of activity
on the keyboard or mouse made it wake up), but the machine still responded
to pings (could not connect w/ telnet or ssh or rlogin). 
does this look like a genuine hw problem or should i upgrade to a newer
2.4.0 test kernel?  i'm happy to do any troubleshooting suggested.
log messages (lots and lots of them.  they all look just like this):

machine is smp pIII450 running on a intel N440bx mb.  main disk is ide,
but i'm using sym53c8xx to access two scsi disks in a logical volume.
thanks,
