It's not just the TNT it will happen to anycard if you do not do one of
the following:
1> Enable VGA text console - but this wont use the FB
2> Enable video mode selection, add vga=ask in lilo.conf and put in a mode
   listed in Documentation/fb/vesa.txt when asked. - This does use the FB
   Once you work out which mode you like change the vga=modenumber (check
   this you may have to convert it to base 10 - decimal)
