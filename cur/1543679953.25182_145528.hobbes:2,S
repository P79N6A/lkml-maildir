You made me read that code about 20 times ;)
Still.  Do we think we know what the actual bug is?  That tasklist_lock
doesn't pin tsk->mm?
If so then let's get that patch of yours happening, but please enhance it to
a) detect the situation where the mm went away, and tell us that it was
   fixed up.  Sufficient to confirm your theory.
b) put in an explicit check for a kill of an mm-less process.  print a
   warning, skip the process.
