Booting with clocksource=tsc still hangs in what appears
to be the exact same place.
Screenshots for that are available here:

Of possible interest is that the bottom of the 25line screen capture
differs somewhat from the 50line capture.. see for yourself.
This is 100% consistent from boot to boot.
Using CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP=y eliminates the problem,
so that's really got to be a huge clue, somehow ?
Meanwhile, I'm going to try a libata patch I just saw posted by Tejun.
