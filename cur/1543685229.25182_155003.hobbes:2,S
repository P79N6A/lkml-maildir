There's more where that came from. I've not done quite as good a job of
tracking the fixes as sending them upstream.
Basically:
(a) any_online_cpu()
(b) cpus_shift_left()
(c) cpu_set()/cpu_clear() need atomicity
(d) something else that's really obvious from looking
all needed fixes, and should have all had stuff sent upstream/to akpm.
