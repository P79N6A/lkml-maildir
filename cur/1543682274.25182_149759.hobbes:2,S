I have succesfully compiled and booted the 2.6.0-test1 kernel. After i 
enter my username and password succesfuly the login window simply stays 
there:
Login: user <enter>
Password: xxxx<enter>
<freezes>
Same thing with gdm. I do not have this problem with 2.4.21+swsup+preempt.
There is no error written in the system log.
Is it possible that PAM + 2.6.0-test1 results in this problem ?
The single runlevel works fine.(booted with single as kernel arg)
I am running gentoo.
Any insight appreciated.
Joe
