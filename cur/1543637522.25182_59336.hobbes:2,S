My Xircom CardBus modem has moved from /dev/ttyS4 to /dev/ttyS14.
Was that intentional ? The kernel printk is also a bit strange:
[asuardi@dolphin asuardi]$ dmesg | grep tty
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS2 at I/O 0x3e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS-14 at I/O 0x4080 (irq = 11) is a 16550A
^^^^^^^
(it works though - message is sent through PPP dialup over the
  Xircom modem :)
