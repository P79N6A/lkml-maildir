Well, following a hint by Carlos Carvalho (thanks, man!), I downloaded and
applied the newest version of the IDE patches, and so far the system appears
to be working fine. I am stress-testing it, and will report back if it
breaks.
Apparently, there is a showstopper bug for the PDC20265 on a A7V for RAID in
the current IDE subsystem of 2.4.17, which is fixed in the newest
incarnation of the IDE patches.  So, for archival purposes, anyone having
issues and hangs with Promise PDC20265 controllers and Linux Software
RAID5, on a VIA kt133 board... you may need to update the IDE subsystem with
the newest patches from linuxdiskcert.org to solve your problem.
