Here are the sysfs class patches reworked against a clean 2.6.0 tree.
I've created a class_simple.c file that contains a "simple" class device
interface.  I've then converted the tty core to use this interface (the
combo of these two patches makes for no extra code added).
Then there are 3 patches, adding class support for misc, mem, and vc
class devices.  As the interface to add simple class support for devices
is now so low, I feel that we do need to have mem class support as to
not special case any char device.
With these patches, it's now much easier for others to implement class
support for remaining char drivers/subsystems that do not have it yet.
Andrew, can you please remove the following 3 patches from your
2.6.0-mm1 tree:
	sysfs-mem-device-support.patch
	sysfs-misc-device-support.patch
	sysfs-vc-device-support.patch
and add these 5 patches instead?  The sysfs-oops-fix.patch needs to
stay.
thanks,
greg k-h
