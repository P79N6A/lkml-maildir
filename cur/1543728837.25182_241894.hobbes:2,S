FYI -
I'm seeing the same issue I saw with earlier 2.6.8rcs on a quad Opteron. When left running
over night with moderate background load (some build jobs) it freezes. No sysrq or ping or 
anything, also no oops one the console. The machine ran previously only 2.6.5 based
kernels which worked fine.
