Right.  That's why I asked whether you were doing something clever with
scheduling ;-)

I'm impressed that you chased it through ;-)  This logic is mostly gone
from 2.5 because I found it too hard to keep in my mind while working
on this file.

Nope, it's true.  But the tasks get marked as runnable in the right order,
so the scheduler should be doing the right thing -- if any tasks really
have a better reason to run first (whether it's through RT scheduling
or through standard Unix priority scheduling) then they'll get the lock
first.  Otherwise, I'd've thought it should be first-runnable, first-run.
