  No, I'm not sure it's the driver's fault. I have this problem since I
switched from nvnet to forcedeth and from 2.4.24 to 2.6.7. But I suspect
this is the drivers fault because:
* I have tried to reproduce it on another 2.6.7 machine (with a
  different driver) and failed.
* Such an important bug in the network stack would hardly go unnoticed.
* The forcedeth driver is still new and somewhat untested :-)

  In my case, it's the incoming packets that get stuck. Outgoing packets
work just fine. But then again, I'm not sure without running further
tests. I sent my message to the list mainly to know if this was a well
know bug.
