  Hi, all. Version 181 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
This is against 2.4.6-pre3. Highlights of this release:
- Answered question posed by Al Viro and removed his comments from <devfs_open>
- Moved setting of registered flag after other fields are changed
- Fixed race between <devfsd_close> and <devfsd_notify_one>
- Global VFS changes added bogus BKL to devfsd_close(): removed
- Widened locking in <devfs_readlink> and <devfs_follow_link>
- Replaced <devfsd_read> stack usage with <devfsd_ioctl> kmalloc
- Simplified locking in <devfsd_ioctl> and fixed memory leak
				Regards,
					Richard....
