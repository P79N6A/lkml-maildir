Thanks for the interest. Attached is a design doc I wrote several months 
ago (with small modifications). It talks about the two pieces of my 
design: group scheduling and dwrr. The description was based on the 
original O(1) scheduler, but as my CFS patch showed, the algorithm is 
applicable to other underlying schedulers as well. It's interesting that I 
started working on this in January for the purpose of eventually writing a 
paper about it. So I knew reasonably well the related research work but 
was totally unaware that people in the Linux community were also working 
on similar things. This is good. If you are interested, I'd like to help 
with the algorithms and theory side of the things.

-------------------------------------------
Overview:
Trio extends the existing Linux scheduler with support for 
proportional-share scheduling. It uses a scheduling algorithm, called 
Distributed Weighted Round-Robin (DWRR), which retains the existing 
scheduler design as much as possible, and extends it to achieve 
proportional fairness with O(1) time complexity and a constant error 
bound, compared to the ideal fair scheduling algorithm. The goal of Trio 
is not to improve interactive performance; rather, it relies on the 
existing scheduler for interactivity and extends it to support MP 
proportional fairness.
Trio has two unique features: (1) it enables users to control shares of 
CPU time for any thread or group of threads (e.g., a process, an 
application, etc.), and (2) it enables fair sharing of CPU time across 
multiple CPUs. For example, with ten tasks running on eight CPUs, Trio 
allows each task to take an equal fraction of the total CPU time. These 
features enable Trio to complement the existing Linux scheduler to enable 
greater user flexibility and stronger fairness.
Background:
Over the years, there has been a lot of criticism that conventional Unix 
priorities and the nice interface provide insufficient support for users 
to accurately control CPU shares of different threads or applications. 
Many have studied scheduling algorithms that achieve proportional 
fairness. Assuming that each thread has a weight that expresses its 
desired CPU share, informally, a scheduler is proportionally fair if (1) 
it is work-conserving, and (2) it allocates CPU time to threads in exact 
proportion to their weights in any time interval. Ideal proportional 
fairness is impractical since it requires that all runnable threads be 
running simultaneously and scheduled with infinitesimally small quanta. In 
practice, every proportional-share scheduling algorithm approximates the 
ideal algorithm with the goal of achieving a constant error bound. For 
more theoretical background, please refer to the following papers:
[1] A. K. Parekh and R. G. Gallager. A generalized processor sharing
approach to flow control in integrated services networks: The single-node
case. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 1(3):344-357, June 1993.
[2] C. R. Bennett and H. Zhang. WF2Q: Worst-case fair weighted fair 
queueing. In Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM '94, pages 120-128, Mar. 1996.
Previous proportional-share scheduling algorithms, however, suffer one or 
more of the following problems:
(1) Inaccurate fairness with non-constant error bounds;
(2) High run-time overhead (e.g., logarithmic);
(3) Poor scalability due to the use of a global thread queue;
(4) Inefficient support for latency-sensitive applications.
Since the Linux scheduler has been successful at avoiding problems 2 to 4, 
this design attempts to extend it with support for accurate proportional 
fairness while retaining all of its existing benefits.
User Interface:
By default, each thread is assigned a weight proportional to its static 
priority. A set of system calls also allow users to specify a weight or 
reservation for any thread. Weights are relative. For example, for two 
threads with weights 3 and 1, the scheduler ensures that the ratio of 
their CPU time is 3:1. Reservations are absolute and in the form of X% of 
the total CPU time. For example, a reservation of 80% for a thread means 
that the thread always receives at least 80% of the total CPU time 
regardless of other threads.
The system calls also support specifying weights or reservations for 
groups of threads. For example, one can specify an 80% reservation for a 
group of threads (e.g., a process) to control the total CPU share to which 
the member threads are collectively entitled.  Within the group, the user 
can further specify local weights to different threads to control their 
relative shares.
Scheduling Algorithm:
The scheduler keeps a set data structures, called Trio groups, to maintain 
the weight or reservation of each thread group (including one or more 
threads) and the local weight of each member thread. When scheduling a 
thread, it consults these data structures and computes (in constant time) 
a system-wide weight for the thread that represents an equivalent CPU 
share. Consequently, the scheduling algorithm, DWRR, operates solely based 
on the system-wide weight (or weight for short, hereafter) of each thread. 
Having a flat space of system-wide weights for individual threads avoids 
performing seperate scheduling at each level of the group hierarchy and 
thus greatly simplies the implementation for group scheduling.
For each processor, besides the existing active and expired arrays, DWRR 
keeps one more array, called round-expired. It also keeps a round number 
for each processor, initially all zero. A thread is said to be in round R 
if it is in the active or expired array of a round-R processor. For each 
thread, DWRR associates it with a round slice, equal to its weight 
multiplied by a system constant, called base round slice, which controls 
the total time that the thread can run in any round.  When a thread 
exhausts its time slice, as in the existing scheduler, DWRR moves it to 
the expired array. However, when it exhausts its round slice, DWRR moves 
it to the round-expired array, indicating that the thread has finished 
round R.  In this way, all threads in the active and expired array on a 
round-R processor are running in round R, while the threads in the 
round-expired array have finished round R and are awaiting to start round 
R+1.  Threads in the active and expired arrays are scheduled the same way 
as the existing scheduler.
When a processor's active array is empty, as usual, the active and expired 
arrays are switched. When both active and expired are empty, DWRR 
eventually wants to switch the active and round-expired arrays, thus 
advancing the current processor to the next round. However, to guarantee 
fairness, it needs to maintain the invariant that the differences of all 
processors' rounds are bounded by a constant, where the smaller this 
constant is, the stronger fairness it can guarantee (the following assumes 
the constant is 1). With this invariant, it can be shown that, during any 
time interval, the number of rounds that any two threads go through 
differs by the constant, which is key to ensuring DWRR's constant error 
bound compared to the ideal algorithm.
To enforce the above invariant, DWRR keeps track of the highest round 
(referred to as highest) among all processors at any time and ensures that 
no processor in round highest can advance to round highest+1 (thus 
updating highest), if there exists at least one thread in the system that 
is still in round highest. There are at least two approaches to maintain a 
global highest round variable. One is to associate it with a global lock 
to ensure consistency of its value. However, this may be not be scalable. 
Thus, a second approach is to use no locking, but it could lead to 
inconsistencies in the value. However, such inconsistencies don't affect 
correctness of the kernel and the only impact is that the fairness error 
of the scheduler can be twice as big as the locking approach, but the 
error is still bounded by a constant and thus sufficient in most cases. 
The following describes the operations of DWRR, assuming the locking 
approach, while the non-locking approach requires only simple changes.
On any processor p, whenever both the active and expired arrays become 
empty, DWRR compares the round of p with highest. If equal, it performs 
idle load balancing in two steps: (1) It Identifies runnable threads that 
are in round highest but not currently running. Such threads can be in the 
active or expired array of a round highest processor, or in the 
round-expired array of a round highest - 1 processor. (2) Among those 
threads from step 1, move X of them to the active array of p, where X is a 
design choice and does not impact the fairness properties of DWRR. If step 
1 returns no suitable threads, DWRR proceeds as if the round of processor 
p is less than highest, in which case DWRR switches p's active and 
round-expired arrays, and increments p's round by one, thus allowing all 
threads in its round-expired array to advance to the next round.
Whenever the system creates a new thread or awakens an existing one, DWRR 
inserts the thread into the active array of an idle processor and sets the 
processor's round to the current value of highest. If no idle processor 
exists, it starts the thread on the least loaded processor among those in 
round highest.
Whenever a processor goes idle (i.e., all of its three arrays are empty), 
DWRR resets its round to zero. Similar to the existing scheduler, DWRR 
also performs periodic load balancing but only among processors in round 
highest. Unlike idle load balancing, periodic load balancing only improves 
performance and is not necessary for fairness.
