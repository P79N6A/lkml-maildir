  i wanted to do another test with bk10 to see if i could
track down my keyboard problems.  after having to deselect
a couple graphics drivers as they caused the compile to 
crash, i got a successful build of bzimage and modules.
  but after i typed "make modules_install", the final
depmod generated some 2000 lines of unresolved symbols.
should i have expected this?
