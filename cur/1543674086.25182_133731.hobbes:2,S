Yes, we allow users to override the defaults if they wish, at their own 
peril.

Using dependencies would mean that the ipsec protocols would not appear in 
the networking menu until after selecting the correct algorthims in the 
crypto menu.
How would users know what the minimally required set of algorithms are?  
Would they then know to go _back_ to the networking menu to enable the
protocols?
