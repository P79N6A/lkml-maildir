Hello,
another request for discussion:
With microseconds resolution there were many CPU cycles per 
microsecond, but for nanoseconds there are multiple nanoseconds per 
CPU cycle (at least this year).
Therefore variations when reading the cycle counter result in time 
jitter at least, eventually maybe even in time running virtually 
backwards occasionally.
The question is: "what assumptions can be made?" On the i386 
architecture, will all cycle counters start at the same moment, and 
will they be bound to the same oscillator? If not one has to 
calibrate each CPU, and remember the cycle counter of each CPU during 
timer interrupt. When getting the time one must find the cycle 
counter of the own CPU and subtract that counter at the last 
interrupt to get the difference. Other architectures maybe even worse.
Colin Plumb suggested to synchronize the cycle counters on i386 
architecture, assuming they'll remain in sync. This would make the 
time code much easier, but break things terrible, if the counters 
drift apart.
Currently i386 issues are preferred, but you can give any suggestions 
or hints you like.
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
