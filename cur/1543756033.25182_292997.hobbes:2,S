On systems with integrated graphics chips, there is no separate ROM chip 
for Video BIOS. Instead, it's integrated into system BIOS (this is true 
for onboard SCSI and pseudo-RAID controllerss too). During early 
initialization, system BIOS decompresses and initializes these BIOSes 
(if these is a PCI vendor ID and device ID match). (There is nothing 
wrong with this - BIOSes on PCI cards should not be run directly from 
the card's ROM but copied to RAM and executed from there instead 
according to PCI spec.)
After the POST is complete, the BIOSes are shadowed in RAM so Video BIOS 
is at C000:0 - so you can run DOS for example.
