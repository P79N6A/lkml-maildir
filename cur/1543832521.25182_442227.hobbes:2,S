And this could/should probably be an append-only file cleared out at
boot, so that the overhead of continually re-reading/re-writing the
file per device node on boot is removed. That'd slow things down for

Any reader just needs to know to read the whole file in, and either
construct a final lookup table in memory or scan backwards.
