Can you give an example here of how to implement the following setup:
- we have a high-priority latency-sensitive server job A and a bunch
of low-priority batch jobs B, C and D
- each job *may* need up to 2GB of memory, but generally each tends to
use <1GB of memory
- we want to run all four jobs on a 4GB machine
- we don't want A to ever have to wait for memory to be reclaimed (as
it's serving latency-sensitive queries), so the kernel should be
squashing B/C/D down *before* memory actually runs out.
Is this possible with the proposed hard/soft limit setup? Or do we
need some additional support for keeping a pool of pre-reserved free
memory available?
