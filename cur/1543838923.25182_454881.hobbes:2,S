I don't see any good way around that. For the page struct it is a
material issue, for the others its not a big deal providing we avoid
accounting dumb stuff like dentries.
At the VM summit Linus suggested one option for user page allocation
tracking would be to track not per page but by block of pages (say the
2MB chunks) and hand those out per container. That would really need the
defrag work though.
