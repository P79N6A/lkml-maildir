I'm not going to argue with you there.

I know, the patch already includes ioctl32.c support for parisc,
sparc64, s390x, ppc64 and mips64.

Yes, I was looking at libfs this morning and think it would remove a
lot of the code from our old fs interface.  Is this going to be
backported to 2.4 so that we can move to an fs interface there too ?
The driver has been designed to support different user interfaces, and
userland is isolated by way of the little libdevmapper library.  So
writing another another interface will be comparitively simple.  We
will do this.  However, I want this to be a seperate piece of work
from the current dm, I see no reason to stall inclusion of dm for
this.
