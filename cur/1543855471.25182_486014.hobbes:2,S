You're right, the command is the same, but the difference is the password's
length and password itself sent to the card.
According to MMC spec 4.1, when a password replacement is done, the length value
(PWD_LEN) shall include both passwords, the old and the new one, and the password
(PWD) shall include the old (currently) followed by the new password.
