FreeBSD and DFBSD have the DRM integrated into the kernel tree, and it
works just great (i.e. no configuration except for Section "DRI") for
our users.  I only get complaints when someone has some new PCI ID, or
when there's some issue in an AGP driver.  Nobody actively uses DRI
CVS's DRM, because I fix DRI CVS and merge to -current whenever there
are major differences, and people on 4-stable generally just grab the
DRM code from -current since I maintain source-level compatibility.
So this is why you don't really hear complaints from BSD users on
dri-devel.  But there are quite a number from them.  I've certainly
heard from over a hundred, and of course that's a tiny fraction of the
total number.
