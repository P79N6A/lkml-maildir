Then perhaps you want a sys_report_page_activation(pid, start_va, len, ...)
which would examine and report on the range in question, instead of adding
your count to so many vmas on which this will never be used.
Though your syscall sounds like pid_madvise: perhaps the call name
should be less specific and left to the flags (come, gentle syscall
multiplexing flames, and warm me).
Looking through the existing fields of a vma, it seems a vm_area_struct
would commonly be on clean cachelines: your count making one of them
now commonly and bouncily dirty.
