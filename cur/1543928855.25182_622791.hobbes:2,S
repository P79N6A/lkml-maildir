The patch I posted resolves a race unrelated to your issue. Raising your
locked memory limits should not be difficult. /etc/limits.conf or similar
should set it up for you. You can also change the default rlimit in the
kernel and compile it with default limits elevated to what you want your
unprivileged process to have to start with if you're truly having lots
of trouble getting userspace to set the default limits properly. I'd
look in include/asm-generic/resource.h
