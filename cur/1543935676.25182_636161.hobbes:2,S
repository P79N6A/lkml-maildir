Something the lvcreate manpage is specifically not clear about is:
Does this create a snapshot of the *disk* at that moment, or does it capture
"disk plus still-to-be-written blocks in the cache"? (Phrased differently, does
it Do The Right Thing regarding "blocks queued before lvcreate" and "blocks
queued for write after lvcreate")?
If the snapshot doesn't capture the blocks queued but still unwritten by
kjournald and similar, then you're still hitting the same old problems that
you always get when you fsck an "active disk".
