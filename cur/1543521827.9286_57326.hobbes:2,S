Subject: [PATCH] fs/nfs, kernel 2.3.35 (and others including current)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The msync() call fails on NFS filesystems.
I can only test this on 2.3.35 (ARM port lag) but visual inspection
shows that it is still present in 2.3.39.
Apparently the inode->i_op->writepage functions are now supposed to
return 0 for success.  The nfs_writepage() function however returns
the size of the operation on success, PAGE_SIZE. 
This starts propagating an error code from do_write_page() 
in mm/filemap.c that eventually pops out in msync().
The following patch fixes it.
