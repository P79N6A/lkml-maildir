Apparently due to his requirement for extreme portability. The  
original code was designed to work on everything from 16-bit DOS  
through CRAY supercomputers through Windows, Unices and Linux.
The author has stated on the thread that it's a good idea to remove  
unnecessary ifdefs when porting the code into the kernel, given that  
the portability requirements are obviously no longer needed.
