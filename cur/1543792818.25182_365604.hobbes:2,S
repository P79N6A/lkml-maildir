It does nothing to explain how exactly the current configuration managed
not to work, which leaves me unsatisfied. I did test the kernel to build
correctly with libusub on and off. All we have is this:

Which is nonsensual, because CONFIG_USB_LIBUSUAL is a boolean.
And reub.net is down, so I cannot fetch the erroneous .config.
I suspect that Reuben did not rerun "make oldconfig" after editing
.config or something of that nature.
What Adrian is proposing may be a good idea or may be not, but it has
nothing to do with the problem.
