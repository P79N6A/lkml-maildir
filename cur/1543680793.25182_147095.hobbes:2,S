 Hi,
 My laptop (thinkpad 570e) hangs hard straight after bringing up 
 interface with d-link dwl-650 wlan card. 2.5.73-bk1 works and
 2.5.73-bk2 to 2.5.75-bk1 hang. If I boot without the card, 
 everything comes up, but inserting the card results to a hang.
 Setting nmi_watchdog=2 has no effect. 
 So, what to try next?
                        --j
