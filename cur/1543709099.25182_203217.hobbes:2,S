Thank you, I do fully concur with you from an ideal scientific perspective
where resources are not constrained. Applying the same perspective I might
like to craft lots of drivers in assembler or even reinvent whatever...,
but I do not live an ideal world.

By a few %, only when old API is used, the benefits far outweighs the cost.
The old API should be an independent glue layer where incompatible.
Performance is not a concern here, functionality is.

Could be fixed by the simple policy that drivers which did not exist before
must use new API.

I am not around here that long, but if those drivers were added after the
API was finalized, it would have been a policy issue which does not have to
be repeated.
At least, (hopefully not from an ideal perspective), the new API is good
enough to last and will not have to be trown away in 2.7 or even 2.9 :)
