Things have changed dramatically since 1995.
In particular, distros got a lot friendlier to install, and customise.
If theres a valid reason for Aunt Tillie to rebuild her kernel, it means
her distro of choice is doing something wrong.

Dumbing down the learning curve doesn't necessary make things easier
for people to learn. Reluctance to read documentation for eg is something
that will plague us no matter how simple we make it to build kernels.
