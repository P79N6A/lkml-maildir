Well I was assuming that the semaphore would go away as well.  Kernel
threads normally use waitqueues to await more work.

Kernel threads should sleep in state TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, with all signals
blocked.  Because they don't want to contribute to the load average, and
because they shouldn't use signals.
So if it was possible to deliver a signal to an all-signals-blocked kernel
thread, that kernel thread would go into a busy loop, because all of its
sleep attempts will fall straight through (signal_pending() is true).  So I
think it's safe to assume that nobody ever does force_sig() on a kenrel
thread.

Yup.
