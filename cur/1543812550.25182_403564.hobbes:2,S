Why not just agree on a normal range of values (ie, 0-255), and let the
driver "denormalize" them?  Thus, a driver that has only 2 levels of
brightness, will treat 0-127 as 0 and 128-255 as 1, and will return only
two possible values 0 and 255.
If a user requests max brightness (255), and the driver is capable of setting
it, then it returns 255.  But if for some reason it can't (ie low power state),
it returns the current max brightness, normalized, (ie 128 instead of 255 and
because that the scale is 0-255, a value of 128 tells the user that only
half of max brightness was set).
And instead of a new "driver_brightness" attribute, why not just a new
attribute that returns the number of brightness levels?
It's similar for power.  We can agree on a range, 0-255.  The range might be
overkill but is consistent with brightness.  The callback converts the VESA
constants to 0 - 0, 1 - 64, 2 - 128, 3 - 255 and sends the value to the driver.
The driver, denormalizes them to, most probably, on and off (0-127 - on,
128-255 - off).
