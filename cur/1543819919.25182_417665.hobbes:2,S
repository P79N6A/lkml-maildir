Yes. If something is related to input it should be integrated into input layer.

The point is that it is not a fake scancode. There are keyboards that
have these keys that don't have anything to do with ACPI. That's why
they belong to input layer. The same goes for lid switch - we have
EV_SW that is used by some PDAs.
Note that I am not saying that other ACPI events, like battery status
or device insertion/removal, should be propagated through input layer.
But things that exist even without ACPI should not be ACPI-specific.
