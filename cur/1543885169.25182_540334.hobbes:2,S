This is being worked on already.  XFS has a per-filesystem ioctl, but
we want to create a filesystem-independent system call,
sys_fallocate(), that would wired into the already existing
posix_fallocate() function exported by glibc.

Samba can just use the posix_fallocate() system call.  Note that if
you have two processes are writing to the same file without proper
locking, you're probably going to run into potential problems anyway.
What if one process is writing whole blockfuls of data, while some
brain-damaged Windows client is writing a byte of zero every 128k, and
thus subtly corrupting the data written by the first process?  We
can't fix brain-damaged applications that aren't doing proper
application level locking....
(Aside, of course, from convincing people to switch away from Vista to
Linux. :-)
