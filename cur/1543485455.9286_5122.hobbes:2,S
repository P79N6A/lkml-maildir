This might also be consequence of the same problem:
mkdir <somedir>
cd <somedir>
rmdir .
Under all OSes I tried, the rmdir . command above returns an error. On linux >
2.1.124 (the version I first noticed to be affected) this silently succeeds.
BTW, this behaviour breaks building egcs/gcc/fixincludes for cross-compilers
under linux, because fixincludes (egcs-1.1b and egcs-1.1.1) contain a fragment
which rely on "rmdir ." failing.
