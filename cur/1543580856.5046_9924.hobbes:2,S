OK, after a little trouble applying the patch, here's what I found:
Starting with the card in working condition, I tried "via-diag -aaeemm -I"
and there was no change in functionality.  Running the ifconfig toggle also
had no overall effect.  Then I tried "via-diag -aaeemm -i" (running a
pinger in another  console) and noted that the pinger stopped working when
the command was run.  However, running "via-diag -aaeemm -I" did not change
that situation.  The ifconfig toggle did correctly restart operation.
Examining the system log after the above showed that at some point during
the sequence the kernel emitted a series of "transmit timed out" log-entry
pairs as shown in my last mail.  Also, I noticed that while running -i the
receive status was listed as "unicast/hashed multicast" and while running
-I the receive status was "unknown/invalid".
Do you want me to try this again, after first setting the card into
non-working condition?
