   net_bh_lock: i have removed it, since it would synchronize to nothing. The
   old protocol handlers should still run on UP, and on SMP the kernel prints
   a warning upon use. Alexey, is this approach fine with you?
Just kill this crap completely.  Old protocol handlers are %100
unsupported in 2.6
I know people are working on fixing up basically every old protocol
layer currently in the tree, so this will not be an issue.
When a "struct packet_type" is registered in dev_add_pack(), fail if
!pt->data which is the indication of "old protocol".  Once all the
protocols are finished being fixed up, pt->data and this test can
die.
