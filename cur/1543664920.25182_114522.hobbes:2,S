Ok, I think I found the reason; sched.c cleans up some stuff in
schedule_tail, and in this code (arch/v850/kernel/entry.S):
C_ENTRY(ret_from_fork):
#if defined(CONFIG_SMP) || defined(CONFIG_PREEMPT)
	mov	r10, r6			// switch_thread returns the prev task.
	jarl	CSYM(schedule_tail), lp	// ...which is schedule_tail's arg
#endif
	mov	r0, r10			// Child's fork call should return 0.
	br	ret_from_trap		// Do normal trap return.
... it only calls that if CONFIG_PREEMPT is turned on.  If I remove the
#ifdef, then I get no warnings.
I take it that the call to schedule_tail should now be unconditional?
[some other archs have the same #ifdef]
Thanks,
-Miles
