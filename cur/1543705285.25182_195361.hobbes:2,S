Well, I have just looked into libusb 0.1.x... I would like to have
asynchronous (non-blocking) access to my device, which libusb doesn't
currently support. Also I don't like the way libusb finds devices -
manually scanning all busses doesn't seem very handy.
Thus I will probably go for a kernel module, using sysfs to interface
with the user. Thanks for all the help anyways-
regards
Jonas
