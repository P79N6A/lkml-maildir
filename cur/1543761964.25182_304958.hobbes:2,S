hm, another thing: i think call_rcu() needs to take the read-lock. Right
now it assumes that it has the data structure private, but that's only
statistically true on PREEMPT_RT: another CPU may have this CPU's RCU
control structure in use. So IRQs-off (or preempt-off) is not a
guarantee to have the data structure, the read lock has to be taken.
