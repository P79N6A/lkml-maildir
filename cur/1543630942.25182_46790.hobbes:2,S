You'll be the first that would report a SiS620 specific problem, so it's
very unlikely to be a driver problem.
If you didn't have CRC errors with previous distributions and they weren't
configured for UDMA your hardware is simply not capable of UDMA (bad cable
or bad drive). That's not a big problem as the kernel works around.
If you had reliable UDMA before and not now, e-mail me the details of your
last known working kernel/kernel config.

I was not expecting this. Isn't `hdparm -i` supposed to check the current dma
mode with an asterisk? It evens checks the last used dma mode (at least
here) when dma is turned off. Guess I shouldn't have `rm -rf`ed the hdparm
source...
