Is this illegal as per kernel codingstyle?  I could understand if we may
want to avoid this sort of thing for the sake of code readability, but
this seems 100% proper to me, especially considering that we're simply
trying to catch an error return code.
One of the things that I really enjoy about the c programming language
is the fact that you can string many operations together into a single
statement through the use of logic.  I hate the thought of a patch being
nacked because of the above.  :-/
If this is indeed kernel codingstyle, then IMHO, we should let it slide
for catching error return codes.
