It's too easy to accidentally cancel a suspend then. There's also the
fact that when debugging is compiled in, other keys are used to control
the debug output: digits set the loglevel, R toggles rebooting and pause
or break toggles pausing between steps (two keys because kdb might be
using pause). I bet Pavel won't like them either, but I've found them
invaluable for debugging and using SysRq combinations resulted in
post-resume problems with the keyboard driver sometimes thinking SysRq
was still being pressed.

Nigel
