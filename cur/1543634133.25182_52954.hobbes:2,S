Umm, this patently fails to meet the criteria you posted of "stable device 
name".  Adding a controller to a system is just as likely to blow this 
naming scheme to hell as it is to blow the traditional linux /dev/sd? 
scheme.  IOW, even though the /proc/scsi/map file looks nice and usefull, 
it fails to solve the very problem you are trying to solve.
