 No you didn't then it seems you are hit by some bug. Have the bug happen.
 Kill userland processes like as you did. Try find out what's running. I would 
 look in /proc/interrupt /proc/net/softnet_stat /proc/net/dev or maybe best to 
 take a profile if possible or Magic SysRq to find out what's looping. Also try
 ifconfig down.
 Cheers.
