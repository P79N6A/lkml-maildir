I think I better make allnoconfig silent (unless with V=1 or something), 
which makes it your miniconfig already almost like allnoconfig.
I'm not quite sure about aborting there are other error possibilities 
(e.g. new dependencies), so you never quite can trust the error value 
anyway.

I indeed need to fix this.
