Umm.. That _trace_ was the only thing that seemed to have any real-life 
dataset, afaik. The others were totally synthetic.

The kernel doesn't actually use LRU, so the fact that LRU isn't good seems 
a non-argument.

People seem to think that the fact that there are bad behaviours means 
that there are somehow "magic" algorithms that don't have bad behaviours.
I'd really suggest somebody show better real-life numbers with a new 
algorithm _before_ we do anything like this.
