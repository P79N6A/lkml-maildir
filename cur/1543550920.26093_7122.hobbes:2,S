I'd just like to confirm that it's illegal to call current()
from interrupt-handling code.
I'm working on the VAX port and the reason I ask is that the
VAX has separate stack pointers for user, kernel and interrupt
contexts.  Therefore, the current = (SP & ~8192) hack will give
completely bogus results when handling an interrupt.
My feeling is that interrupt code has no business calling current(),
but I don't know the kernel well enough to be sure.  Is there any
interrupt-level code that calls current() or is it a design
principle that it cannot be called?
Thanks,
Kenn
