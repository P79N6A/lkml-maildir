It depends on the purpose of DEBUG_RODATA.  If DEBUG_RODATA was for
security reasons then I agree, but it seems to be more to catch
accidental writes. Kprobes isn't an accidental write and I would
suspect many developers would want to catch accidental writes and be
able to insert kprobes.
Or is there something else I'm missing - i.e. you're saying the patch
itself is crap?
