OK, well this seems to have opened quite a can of worms. Programming the
handling of unaligned access traps on parisc is quite above my
possibilities.
I did notice that mark_de_without_sd() in reiserfs_fs.h just calls the
ext2_{set|clear|test}_bit routines. If the host architecture should
handle that with unaligned addresses, obviously the exception for s390
should also go. The current source would make reiserfs slow on sparc as
well, if I understand correctly.
To solve this for parisc, I see two possibilities:
- rewrite asm/parisc/bitops.h to have the ext2_* routines handle
  unaligned addresses. This would possibly be slowing down all aligned
  access. Not so nice.
- rewrite reiserfs_fs.h to use it's own test/set/clear bit routines.
  This would lose all the optimizations all specific architectures have
  in their asm/*/bitops.h. Also not nice.
Keeping in mind that I don't know any parisc assembly, is there any way
I can help resolve this in an elegant manner?
