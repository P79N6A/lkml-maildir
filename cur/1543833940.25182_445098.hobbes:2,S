We are currently aiming for a public release of the SATURN tool some 
time in fall this year. Other students are also working on different 
types of analyses/verification modules, which will slowly become ready 
if everything goes as planned.

Also, we will ready (e.g. double-check and pretty-print) more reports 
and mail them (CC'ed to security@kernel.org) in chunks as soon as they 
are ready. Please let us know if there is anything else you want us to do.
Thanks a lot, it's exciting to hear back from developers after working 
on this for a long time :)
