Yeah, looks fine.
It's probably not a bad idea to update drivers/pci/oldproc.c and
include/linux/pci.h while you are at it.  (In 2.4 the files are
drivers/pci/pci.ids and include/linux/pci_ids.h.)  And when you do,
also CC Martin Mares to make sure he has the updated IDs.  Which in
this case he does, because they're in 2.4 already.
