Subject: kernel bug in sched.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/7/31/177

My new 2.4.0-test4 kernel has been crashing out and sometimes rebooting.  I captured the following message:
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Scheduling in interrupt
kerneI BUG at sched.c:680!
invalid operand: 0000
...
...
Process XGGI
...
...
Code: 0f 0b 8d 65 dc 5b 5e 5f 89 ec 5d c3 55 89 e5 83 ec 14 57 56
now, for what i was doing.... :)
this bug seems to be related to running XGGI on a fbdev device (running multiple matrox G200 cars) and using the USB drivers.  (running a USB keyboard and a USB mouse, with /dev/input/mouse0 and /dev/input/event0 interfaces).
(using OHCI USB device)
when i run XGGI this seems to happen every once in a while... havne't gotten it to where i can reliably do it yet, but will let you know when i can.
how this relates to the scheduler, i have no clue, and don't really know what else to do :)
attached is a file with the output of "dmesg", and a copy of my kernel config file, in case they help.
