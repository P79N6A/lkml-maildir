Additionally, using a swapfile allows you to share swapspace with other
OSes.
This can be rather handy on a multibooting laptop with a small
harddrive.
I've done this successfully on a laptop multibooting RedHat 8.0 and
Windows XP. The procedure is quite simple:
 - Set up the Windows swapfile on a FAT32 partition, it will preallocate
the file as pagefile.sys (up to the minimum size that you specify).
 - Make sure the FAT32 partition gets mounted in /etc/fstab.
 - mkswap the pagefile.sys file in the Linux bootscripts before
swapfiles are turned on (Windows will trash the Linux swap signature).
 - Fortunately Windows will gladly use a swapfile trashed by Linux, so
there's no need to backup and restore any Windows swapfile headers.
One unfortunate disadvantage is that Windows hibernation to disk cannot
be used, since it assumes the contents of the pagefile are unmodified
when you resume.
Does anyone know if NTFS-TNG in 2.5 is robust enough to mount Windows XP
partitions and allow overwriting of existing files such as pagefile.sys?
If that is the case, the procedure is even easier because you can
eliminate the FAT32 partition and simply mount the main Windows XP
installation partition.
