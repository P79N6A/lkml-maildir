hi,
I want to change from 2.2.1 (which never created real problems)
on a production box to a more recent one - now the question 
is which one.
in general, which one is supposed to be the most stable 
from 2.2.7 to 2.2.10?
I know there are different experiences and so might look
the answers - I just want to have a quick overview from
some ouf you, which one may be the best today...
I'm running smp (2xPII) on asus, adaptec 7xxx, raid5.
thanks for suggestions/warnings -
frank
