Nono, I try to remove the swap space occupied by pages that
go back onto the active list.  Regardless of whether they
were already there, or whether they started out on the
inactive list.
Stripping the swap space of the pages that are going to
the inactive list makes less sense IMHO, because those
pages are candidates for swapping out - meaning those
should keep the space.
