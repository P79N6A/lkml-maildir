Subject: [PATCH 0/5] ehca: MR large page, small queue and fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is a patch set against Roland's git, branch for-2.6.23 for ehca.
It adds support for MR large page and small queues. In addition of that
it also contains various small fixes from previous comments and what
we found.
They are in details:
[1/5] adds support for MR large page
[2/5] generates event when SRQ limit reached
[3/5] makes ehca2ib_return_code() non inline
[4/5] makes internal_create/destroy_qp() static
[5/5] adds support for small queues
The patches should apply cleanly, in order, against Roland's git. Please
review the changes and apply the patches if they are okay.
Regards,
Nam & Stefan
