Doesn't matter.  From a userspace point of view there is no process with 
that PID, so kill() should return ESRCH.  In the kernel, I think this 
means that kill() should actually be looking up tgids rather than pids.

PID="process ID"
You have one PID per process.

No, they are implemented as separately schedulable entities with lots of 
shared state.  "process" and "thread" are POSIX terms that don't really 
mean anything in the kernel.

Pthreads define signal handling.  Signals are delivered to the process 
as a whole, not to any particular thread.  If you specify a TID that is 
not a valid PID, then the kernel should return an error.

If the syscall is supposed to operate on processes, it should operate on 
all threads within a process.  It would be nice to have a way to specify 
affinity for threads.  POSIX doesn't define one though.
