Let me turn that around.
Which of the "extern inline" functions are we taking the address?
The parisc kernel wouldn't (shouldn't) link if that were true.

Ok.  Sounds like "extern inline" is the same as __always_inline.
Has gcc community confirmed "gcc -Wmissing-prototypes" behavior
is really correct with respect to "extern inline"?
If so, I'm ok with changing "extern inline" to __always_inline.
