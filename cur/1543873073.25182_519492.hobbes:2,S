SAT (aka ATA passthru) defines how to do soft-reset.
SG_IO supports the ATA_12 and ATA_16 commands which permit soft-reset 
and similar tasks.  libata supports this interface, but does not yet 
support soft-reset and similar non-comment-oriented tasks.  This would 
be the best area to add such features, though.
