Debian renices X by default to -10 ... I fixed all my desktop interactivity
problems around 2.5.63 timeframe by just turning that off. That was way 
before Con's patches.
There may be some more details around this, and I'd love to hear them,
but I fundmantally believe that explitit fiddling with particular
processes because we believe they're somehow magic is wrong (and so
does Linus, from previous discussions).
