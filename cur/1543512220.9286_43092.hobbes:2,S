	1) Your paragraph is invalid because devfs can
	   be used in a number of capacities
		a) Fully replace standard /dev, and run
		   in total compatibility mode. (And
		   it has persistence with devfsd, no
		   more bullshit from you people)
		b) Allow for automatic population of
		   standard /dev
		c) deconfigured.
	2) You've all been notified of these very same
	   things a zillion times.
