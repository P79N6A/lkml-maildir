There is no _NEED_ for this thread - except in your own mind.
I will tell you that this thread has done more to hurt your cause than
help.  I used to ALWAYS mention GNU when talking to anyone about
Linux.  Since this infantile horse shit started on this list, I don't
mention GNU anymore at all and I never will again.  I cease to give
you any credit for anything Linux related and have begun to expunge
every reference to GNU/Linux on any of the systems under my control.
That happens to be ~600 systems.  Also I am removing it from any
upgrade packages I send out.
Your own fault.  I'm tired of your damned spam on this list.  If I see
much more, I'm going to start being actively anti-GNU.
As far as I'm concerned, my systems now run Linux, NOT GNU/Linux!
