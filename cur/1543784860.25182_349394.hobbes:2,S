So in that case, user applications should ignore READY
LED MEANING in sysfs and ask the device directly.
For example:
    sdparm --get RLM --transport sas /dev/sda

... and what about multiple initiators sitting on different
machines? Should they be responsible for:
  1) finding out about one another
  2) and keeping the sysfs tree in the other machine
     in sync when one changes READY LED MEANING
     (or anything else)?
Putting distributed state information in sysfs and then
passing off the responsibility for maintaining its state
(because it is a difficult problem) brings into question
the wisdom of the strategy.
