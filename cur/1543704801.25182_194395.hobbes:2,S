Can you make adjust_jiffies() print out its arguments (it's in 
drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c).
It looks like cpufreq_scale() gets a divide-by-zero or an overflow on one 
of
	l_p_j_ref, l_p_j_ref_freq, ci->new
and just printing out those values would be interesting.
That said, the code is crap anyway. It does various divides without 
actually testing for any sanity at all, and tries to "avoid overflow" by 
totally bogus methods, instead of just using the 64-bit do_div64().
Dominic? Dave? Suggestions about nicer failure modes?
