Actually, I still think my second approach (the PageSlab) is probably
(if tested) the easiest for now, because it should fix the reported
(Willy's) problem, without any change or copy overhead for splice to
file (which could be still wrong, but not obviously wrong). Then we
could search for the only right way (which is most probably around
Herbert's new skb page allocator. IMHO "my" "copying approach" is too
risky e.g. for stable etc. because of unknown memory requirements,
especially for some larger size page configs/systems.
