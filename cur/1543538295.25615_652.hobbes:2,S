i've long-since used something like this:
         /* since inet_ntoa uses a 'fixed' buffer, and you therefore cannot
          * use more than one per printf, we've rolled our own ...
          * NOTE: only for intel platform
          */
         #define inet_int_ntoa(addr) \
                 (addr) & 0xff, \
                 (addr>>8) & 0xff, \
                 (addr>>16) & 0xff, \
                 (addr>>24) & 0xff
         ...
with the obvious printf / printk being something like:
         fprintf(stderr,"added interface %d '%s', ipaddr %d.%d.%d.%d 
(netmask %d.%d.%d.%d) %s\n",
                 found,
                 config->iface[found]->name,
                 inet_int_ntoa(config->iface[found]->addr.s_addr),
                 inet_int_ntoa(config->iface[found]->netmask.s_addr),
                 (config->iface[found]->wccp_participant ? 
"[wccp-participant-i/face]" : ""));
given that such a thing is typically used in debug-type printf's, i don't 
see it as being too ugly.
cheers,
lincoln.
