OK, I'll try to accelerate the effort to send these to you.
We'll still need some kind of bucket for the patches that
don't apply to recent kernels, but which no one has yet
had time to bring up-to-date (or evaluate for permanent
dismissal).  And dribbling them out, fixing them up,
responding to issues - all take time that I can't
commit to personally for the next week or so.
I'll let Michael respond whether he can get to this
sooner rather than later, as planned.
