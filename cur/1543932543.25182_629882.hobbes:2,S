On a 1GB system, this leads to a ratio of 3 active anon
pages to 1 inactive anon page, and a maximum inactive
anon list size of 250MB.
On a 1TB system, this leads to a ratio of 100 active anon
pages to 1 inactive anon page, and a maximum inactive
anon list size of 10GB.
The numbers in-between looked reasonable :)
Basically the requirement is that the inactive anon list 
is large enough that pages get a chance to be referenced
again, but small enough that the maximum amount of work
the VM needs to do is bounded to something reasonable.

A 1:1 ratio simply means that the inactive anon list is
the same size as the active anon list. Page replacement
should still work fine that way.
