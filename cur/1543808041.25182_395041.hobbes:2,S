Additional negative sides:
- full isolation can be inconvinient from containers management point of 
view. You will need to introduce new modified tools such as top/ps/kill 
and many many others. You won't be able to strace/gdb processes from the 
host also.
- overhead when virtualization is off, result is not the same.
- additional args everywhere (stack usage, etc.)

It has some other additional advantages:
- flexible: you can select full isolation or weak is required. I really 
believe this is very important.

Yep. And containers were what I wanted to start with actually. Not VPIDs.
