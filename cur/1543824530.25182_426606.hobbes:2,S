Okay, that is rather a nice cleanup.  I've held off from doing it,
and have discouraged one or two others from doing it, because there's
a number of other things to be checked thereabouts (witness the way
vfc_dev.c is or'ing flags it has no business to change: but you've
rightly preserved that existing behaviour for now, however bad it may
be); and there's VM_RESERVED (or most of its or'ings) to be removed too.
But what you have looks nice, and no way does it prevent further
cleanup later; though I've not wanted to bother maintainers repeatedly.
Of course, you don't need this patch in order to proceed with migrating
VM_LOCKED areas, because this patch is no more than a cleanup of
irrelevance.  Well, somewhat worse than irrelevance: when a driver
unilaterally sets VM_LOCKED on a vma, then mm->locked_vm goes wild
when the vma is unmapped: doesn't matter at exit, but bad if before.
