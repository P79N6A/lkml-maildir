Good. I have also confirmed that it's not a problem with multiple
files. One large file (210 megabytes), when copied from a remotely-
mounted file-system to /tmp will fail, however, copying it to /dev/null
will not!???? Now, the null-sink doesn't have to do locking. Copying
to a file-system does --erm...
The mounted file-system becomes inaccessible. It can be `umounted`,
then `mounted` and it becomes accessible again. The return message
from `cp` is I/O error. `strace /bin/ls /mnt` returns:
[Non pertainent stuff snipped]
lstat("/mnt", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0
brk(0x11000)                            = 0x11000
stat("/mnt", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0
open("/mnt", O_RDONLY)                  = 4
fcntl(4, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
brk(0x12000)                            = 0x12000
readdir(4, {d_ino=135169, d_name="."})  = 1
readdir(4, {d_ino=2, d_name=".."})      = 1
readdir(4, 0x11000)                     = 0
close(4)                                = 0
_exit(0)                                = ?
In other words, its perfectly happy and thinks nothing is mounted.
Cheers,
