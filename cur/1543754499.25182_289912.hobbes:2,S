Not quite. It still uses the hardware timebase, but we use a common
infrastructure to calculate time. I believe you'll find the common code
similar to the current ppc64 time code, as it seemed to be one of the
better timeofday implementations (oh the joy of sane hardware time
devices).

The performance is a concern, and right now there are issues (ntp_scale
being the top of the list) however I hope they can be resolved. Looking
at ppc64's do_gettimeofday() vs this implementation there we do have
more overhead, but maybe you could suggest how we can avoid some of it?

I still want to support vsyscall gettimeofday, although it does have to
be done on an arch-by-arch basis. It's likely the systemcfg data
structure can still be generated and exported. I'll look into it and see
what can be done.
