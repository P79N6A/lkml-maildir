I think you're being too fs centric. Moving only the pagecache to a
large order is enough to you but it isn't enough to me, I'd like all
allocations to be faster, and I'd like to reduce the page fault
rate. The CONFIG_PAGE_SHIFT isn't just about I/O. It's just that
CONFIG_PAGE_SHIFT will give you the I/O side for free too.
Also keep in mind mixing multiple page sizes for different inodes has
the potential to screw the aging algorithms in the reclaim code. Just
to make an example during real random I/O over all bits of hot cache
in pagecache, a 64k page has 16 times more probability of being marked
young than a 4k page.
The tail packing of pagecache could very well be worth it. It should
cost nothing for the large files.

I understand you mean multiple page size in pagecache, but I see it as
a feature to keep the fast paths as fast as they can be.
