	Hi,
	I noticed something "funny". In wake_up_process (kernel/sched.c
line 324, 2.3.34) reschedule_idle is called after doing a
spin_lock_irqsave. In reschedule_idle, every exit has an spin_unlock_irqrestore. 
Except when the kernel is compiled without __SMP__. In this case, no unlock is 
preformed.
	Will this not leak on the stack? What am i missing?
	me
