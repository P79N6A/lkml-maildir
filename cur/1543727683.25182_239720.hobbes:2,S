Filtering is essential. If you have CAP_SYS_RAWIO set then anything
goes. Root is entitled to reflash his hard disk to report all files
having setuid bits, or to total the media or to password lock it.
End users are not and the only sane kernel behaviour for the "unsure"
case is "-EPERM". If its not the right behaviour we have setuid bits.
If it was the other way around your end user just password locked all
your disks with a password you'll never recover.
