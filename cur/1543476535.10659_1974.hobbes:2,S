ALI IV and V ide-chipset support found at URL below.
This will not be in 2.2.0 at release time.........there are still problems
in covering all variations of the implemtaion of the chipset.
Linus will not take this yet, so please don't bug him.
Lastly until I can get a loaner board to test or have some money to burn
(very unlikely, 6 month son), I can not yet press the issue with Linus.
To the very best of my knowledge, this will not harm anything.
However, using ide-scsi with an EIDE-CD-RW will require that one move the
device to the second HWIF and disable AUTO_DMA at compile time andpass
ide0=dma at boot.
This comment is based on imperical test reports form a few brave souls.
