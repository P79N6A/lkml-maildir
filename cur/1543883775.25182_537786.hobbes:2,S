I'll be dropping this from -mm now.  I don't think we're learning anything
more by having it in there and I generally want to get things more back
into sync.
For the record, I don't recall any problem reports arising from SD's
presence in -mm (Except for possibly Jiri's recent "many processes end up
in D state", but we don't have a clue what's causing that yet).
