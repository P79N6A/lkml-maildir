Subject: [PATCH] kdb/mdb hardware breakpoints broken 2.4.17/18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/1/23/99

Please find a patch that corrects the problem with hardware 
breakpoints not working with kdb.  I have noticed that gdb uses 
inserted int3 (0xCC) breakpoints (as does kdb) for soft breakpoint
support, so this fix may not affect these programs.  It is not 
clear why every signal handled is writing a 0 t the DR7 register.
Patch submitted to Keith Owens and Linux kernel.
