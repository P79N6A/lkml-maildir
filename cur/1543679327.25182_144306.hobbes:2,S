Well, it shouldn't *imho*. And it is possible. Currently I am running 
2.4.20-wolk4.3 and I do "make -j32 bzImage modules" and I cannot make XMMS 
skip doesn't matter what I do, it is not possible. Even X is smooth, kmail 
does not freeze, an Xterm needs ~4 seconds to open.
My tree uses the O(1) from Andrea including the fixes.
Now I've tried your suggestion, "make -j2" with .73-mm2 + the mentioned 
patches. Three skips during the whole compilation (bzImage modules).
ciao, Marc
