NACK.
This is no problem for ISDN only some old HW drivers may not work (for most
I do not have any hardware by myself). 
I will compile all drivers again and if here are 64 bit issues I will
disable the drivers, not ISDN.
ISDN works on 64 bits, at least with following protocols:
- transparent (audio/voice)
- X.75
- HDLC
- sync PPP
Maybe some other protocols need some 64 bit cleanup, but last time I audited
the ISDN core code for 64 bit I did not saw any problems.
My main test machines are 64 bit (and SMP) and they are running ISDN servers
for sync PPP and voice data processing on different ISDN HW and drivers
(CAPI and Hisax) without any problem.
You will see still some warnings in the CAPI code, because the capi code
has dual 64/32 bit protocol format for data packets (has 2 different pointer
areas one for 64 bit one for32 bit), but this is OK.
