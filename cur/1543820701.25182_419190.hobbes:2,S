... which, for the point of view of people developing most parts of the
kernel (and thus not caring about C++ much) just makes the names ugly.
When some struct member describes a device class the device belongs to,
calling it anything else than "class" is silly.
But yes, the C++ modules can redefine such things by macros when
including kernel headers.
				Have a nice fortnight
