Note convinced about "cvs annotate".  Maybe annotation with version
numbers.  But "cvs diff" and "cvs update" are very useful.
You know, there's nothing to stop somebody making a read-only CVS server
where the version tree mirrors the patches on ftp.kernel.org.  Nobody
needs write access -- except the script which does the mirroring.
I would certainly find "cvs update" very useful for keeping up to date
and being sure I really _am_ using the correct source files.  I'd find
"cvs diff" very useful for submitting patches against the latest
release, or indeed against older releases as preferred.
