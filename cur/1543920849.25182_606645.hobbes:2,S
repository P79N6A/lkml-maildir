On a related hardware note:
FWIW, most ATA controllers have scatter/gather tables that terminate 
themselves by a bit in the final s/g entry.  The 90% case needs to know 
the last scatterlist entry, at the end of the s/g walk.
So however this all gets worked out, please make sure not to unduly 
punish libata controllers with an expensive sg_last() inside a loop, or 
something like that.  :)
