I want the kernel to avoid every delay that can be avoided.  Do not force
a pipeline flush for speculative rdtsc.  Besides those 20-30 cycles
there is register eviction for %eax, %ecx, %edx and save+restore for %ebx
(CPUID scribbles on 4 registers), plus possible branch misprediction if control
is not fall-through sequential.  Also, that kernel code probably is already
several dozen cycles after the most recent user-mode instruction
(the only thing that the user can control), so waiting for quiescent
pipeline is just the kernel lollygagging on itself.  Get to work!
