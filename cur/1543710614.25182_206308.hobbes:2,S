I am trying to assign name for a USB slot on my PCs front so that when I plug 
in USB stick or USB drive or whatever I get the same name. Always.

why? The 'physical location' is the only thing that is unlikely to change 
unless you physically change you hardware.
Anyway - it appears that udev (as of 022 now) still does not support doing it. 
Once more - I want to make sure that SCSI disk plugged in specific USB slot 
(that does not ever change) always gets the same name. So that I always know 
how to access it.
naive user would think that something like
KERNEL="sd*" BUS="usb" PLACE="2.4:1.0" SYMLINK="flash0/sd%n"
would work. Surely it does not. When udev sees "sd*" it does not see bus USB. 
When udev sees bus USB it does not see "sd*". It does (probably) see sd* on 
bus SCSI but it does not help me in any way because I have no way to 
associate SCSI ID with USB port. While kernel does know that "sda" is a child 
of USB port 2.4:0.1 I do not see any way to express it in udev.
Could somebody explain what am I doing wrong. Thank you.

so you suggest him to add every device separately? And if he has half a dozen 
friends having half a dozen devices each - do you suggest adding yet another 
40 lines for all of them? And keep it in sync with all updates and upgrades?
On the contrary he likely has just a couple of USB ports and one firewire and 
he just needs three lines for *any* device which is ever going to be plugged 
in. Or he would need if it was supported.
thank you
