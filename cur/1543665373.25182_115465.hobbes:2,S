Do you have a sort of glue fixing the ramdisk support on m68k to support
physically non-continous memory too? Otherwhise I have only 1 MiB for
the whole initrd.
So hopefully the removal of ipconfig.c, if decided for, does not
propagate back into the 2.4 series. It would add a heap of useless work
to do, just to get it up again.
