Fair?  I said interactivity wise.  But what the heck, if we're talking
fairness, I can say the same thing about I/O bound tasks.  Heck, it's
not fair to stop any task from reaching the top, and it's certainly not
fair to let them have (for all practical purposes) all the cpu they want
once they sleep enough.  Shoot, the scheduler is unfair even without any
interactivity code.  Long term, it splits tasks into two groups... those
that sleep for more than 50% of the time... yack yack yack... zzzzz
Let's stick to the interactivity side :)

Three of the little buggers are enough to cause plenty of pain.
