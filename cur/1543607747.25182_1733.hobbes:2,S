Subject: 2.4.13-acX: NM256 hangs at boot

I've been succesfully using NM256-soundmodule on my Dell Latitute
CPtC400 until I upgraded from kernel 2.4.12-ac5 to 2.4.13-ac3. Now the
system hangs at boot - or to be more precise, right after boot when
modutils try to load nm256_audio.o as instructed in /etc/modules.
Lockup is complete, even power-button doesn't work so I have to remove
battery and power-cord to get the machine shut down. I have
APM-support compiled in, no ACPI.
NM256 is PCI-based, so I checked whether CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI would have
any effect. It didn't.
Exactly the same thing happens with 2.4.13-ac4.
If I compile the kernel without sound-support, everything works just
fine.
Has anyone had similar problems? What additional info should I
produce?
