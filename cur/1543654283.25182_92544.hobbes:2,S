The first part of the patch looks suspicious. If PF_MEMALLOC
is set we shouldn't be allowed to go into try_to_free_pages()
in the first place, should we ?

Neat. Exactly the thing I was looking for for an O(1) VM
optimisation, good to know it's possible in 2.5 ;)

Very nice, though if you're worried about effective reclaiming
you might be interested in Arjan's O(1) VM code, which I'll
probably forward-port to 2.5 once I've got it properly tuned.
