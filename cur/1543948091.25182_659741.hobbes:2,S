If you want that, I think Cc-ing reporters might be a good idea.

Two other issues, both with tested patches which do not seem to be in
mainline yet:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/22/127
2.6.25-rc[1,2]: failed to setup dm-crypt key mapping
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/25/400
new regression in 2.6.25-rc3: no keyboard/lid acpi events on thinkpad T61p
I think this last one is bug 10100
Thanks,
MST
