You don't state whether the mouse actually works.
Assuming it doesn't, yes, please bugzilla it, or bug the folks at
linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

This is probably due to userspace performing a system call while the CPU
has interrupts disabled.  Privileged apps can do this - the X server and
hwclock are two examples.
Longer-term we probably need to remove the irqs_disabled() test from
__might_sleep().
