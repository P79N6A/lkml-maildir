Not in my case.  I have drivers that execute queued requests from a bottom
half routine.  The driver accepts configuration information from a user-space
utility that runs long after boot time.  The configuration information
specifies such hardware parameters as IRQ and shared memory address.
I don't understand what the problem is here.  When get_vm_area is called with
GFP_KERNEL and it finds itself "at interrupt level", it simply changes the
priority parameter to GFP_ATOMIC and proceeds with the request.  The
allocation routines seem to have code in them to protect critical sections
from being interrupted.
So why have the restriction on when device memory can be mapped?  Or why not
create a variant of ioremap/vremap with a "priority" parameter so that I can
have some control over this?
Thanks,
Dave

If so, then why does get_vm_area simply change  the value of the priority
parameter and proceed with the request?
