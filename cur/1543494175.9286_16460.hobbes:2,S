open("/dev/dsp", O_WRONLY)              = -1 ENOMEM (Cannot allocate memory)
write(2, "Can\'t open /dev/dsp!\n", 21Can't open /dev/dsp!

There was NO such problem with older 2.2.x kernels (with the SAME alsa driver).
Another interesting issue that some minutes ago dsp could be opened but
playing an MP3 often paused for a while in case of some LIGHT disk I/O
activity which never happened with 2.2.6 !
(This could be some memory fragmentation because stopping my netscape and
X server allows me to play that MP3 with 2.2.7 too)
