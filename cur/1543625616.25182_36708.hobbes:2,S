  Okay, that's a reasonable decision. I'm all in favor of paranoia, any
problem at this point would be best detected early on, nut if you're
convinced that it's safe without it, I certainly can't argue, and wasn't
intending to initially.
  Actually I don't think CONFIG_SMP would completely avoid problems, if I
read the code right it would still have a problem if you had an SMP kernel
running "nosmp"  option at boot (or possibly booted on a uni, although I
haven't tried w/o 'nosmp'). 
  Thanks for all the information, clearly if any check is needed, that
check is not the one, at least as is.
