Agree with most of the stuff you wrote.

One of the claimed advantages of the '...' interface is that everything
is editable as a file.  So if someone wanted to edit the description
extended attribute for foo.txt, he would just run
"[editor] foo.txt/.../description" (or
"[editor] /meta/fs/$(getattrpath foo.txt)/description"), instead of
needing to use some special purpose editor.  It works well for things
like being able to use Gimp to edit a thumbnail or icon attribute.
Of course, it shouldn't be too hard to provide both interfaces, as long
as you get locking and caching right...
The Reiser4 file-as-dir interface is also supposed to be more flexible
than POSIX extended attributes.  For example adding attributes to
attributes (e.g. adding a mimetype attribute to a thumbnail attribute).
The point of it is to present many different things (extended
attributes, file manipulation magic like automatic compress, etc.)
through a single interface that everyone knows how to use (i.e. regular
files) so that people can use regular programs to edit or manipulate
them.
The inspiration, I think, was the MacOS X/NeXTSTEP bundle format.  For
example, MacOS X/NeXTSTEP .app file is actually a directory that behaves
much like an executable file (double-clicking a .app file in the Finder
launches the application, instead of opening the directory).  However,
it is in reality a directory that contains many things that could be
thought of as extended attributes (such as the application icon,
information about the application, etc.).  Since the application icon is
a real file, it can be edited by normal graphics editors (not like
Windows programs, where you need a special icon editor).  And since it's
inside the .app directory, it's attached to the application (not like
Linux, where the program is in /usr/bin, and the icon is in
/usr/share/pixmaps), so it makes package management easier (to delete an
application, just delete the .app file -- don't need to look in
/usr/share/pixmaps for the icon and delete it).

I don't see that this should be a major problem either, but I thought it
was worth bringing up.

Although I guess if they have a file descriptor open, they probably have
the original filename lying around somewhere...

Agreed! :-D
