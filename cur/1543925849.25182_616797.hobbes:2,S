  Actually, there has been a response (Eric asked in mailing list and
created a bug and got answer to the mailing list):

  As I read the bug it seems that the cause was a filesystem with errors
(which were in ACL's and thus kernel didn't boot only with ACL's
enabled) and fsck fixed the problem... I would close this one as
invalid (OK, I know the filesystem had to be corrupted somehow but
unless this is at least occasionally reproducible, there's low chance of
finding the bug).
