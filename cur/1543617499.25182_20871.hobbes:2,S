Hi all,
I get an ELF file on a ramdisk using TFTP. I want to
interpret the ELF file in the ramdisk, and load it
into memory (SDRAM) using the ramdisk as a block
device, but without using any file system.
Is this possible? Any pointers will be greatly
appreciated.
Thanks,
prodyut.
PS: Currently I use CRAMFS to get the ELF file into
ramdisk. Then I load the ELF file into memory using
CRAMFS. I want to get rid of the CRAMFS on top of ELF.
