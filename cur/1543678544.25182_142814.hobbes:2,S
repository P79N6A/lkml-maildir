This handling of wacky pages apparently does not carry over into some
of the rmap optimizations, but I will let dmccr speak to that.

The race is as follows:
	Node 0				Node 1
	mmap()s file f1
					writes to f1
					sends msg to Node 0 requesting data
	pgflt on mmap
	do_no_page() invokes ->nopage
	->nopage hands page up
	<some interrupt or other delay>
	receives message from Node 1
	invokes invalidate_mmap_range()
	returns data to Node 1
					receives data from Node 0
					does write
	<return from interrupt or whatever>
	do_no_page() installs now-stale mapping
	return from page fault
	application scribbles on page, violating DFS's consistency!!!
Now Node 0 and Node 1 have inconsistent versions of the page being
written to.  Note that this problem occurs regardless of the mechanism
that Node 1 does to accomplish the write -- mmap(), write(), whatever.
This race is a problem only in distributed filesystems that provide
the same consistency guarantees normally found on local filesystems.
Things like NFS or AFS would not be bothered, since they do not offer
such consistency guarantees.  For example, with AFS, the last guy
to close the file wins.
