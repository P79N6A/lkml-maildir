My intention for that code was always that it be a simplest-possible 
reference implementation for the spinlock pvops, and perhaps a basis for 
a more specialized version (the Xen version is based on byte locks, for 
example). 
The code is "dead" in the sense that it has no users, but it also 
results in no generated code, and should be easy to maintain if the 
spinlock API is changed (as it is a canary to show that the other 
implementations will need changing too).  In particular, the "paravirt 
spinlock" mechanism relies on all implementations using the same static 
initializer, and I wanted there to be an obvious second implementation 
so that if someone decided to change the ticketlock initializer, they'd 
be forced to consider what happens with the bytelock initializer (and by 
extension, any other implementation).
It's also useful as a baseline for benchmarking.
