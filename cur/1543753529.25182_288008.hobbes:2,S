It's as precise as above problem report.

No, it's not. Please provide more information why exactly this is broken.

So they should first try the 2.6 kernel provided by the distribution and 
then try compiling their own kernel. In this situation it's actually more 
likely that they produce a working kernel with the current behaviour, the 
defconfig is not a guarantee for a working kernel either.
Sorry, but as long as nobody writes an autoconfig tool for the kernel, the 
kernel configuration is not a simple process and any default can only be a 
compromise and may fail. If you have evidence that there are better 
defaults, we can change this, but your problem report above is not enough.
bye, Roman
