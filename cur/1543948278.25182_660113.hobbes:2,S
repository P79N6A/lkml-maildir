I'm figuring that the risk is high that we broke the existing calls,
when the new MPOL_F_*_NODES flags are not used.

That won't cut it for Oracle, or other such major applications
using NUMA mempolicy calls.  If we wait for them to report breakage,
it will be a year or two down the road from now, and it would be
another year or two before they could presume the fix was in the
kernel version they were supporting.
