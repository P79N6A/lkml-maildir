Did some more testing and apparently its something to do with the alps
touchpad patch. When using the alps as a touchpad all the input
completely dies on X startup, when I use it as a GlidePointPS/2 things
work fine (even with the alps patch), although mouse is a bit slow.
Will try and dig further and see if I come up with a fix.
