That's where we, who are not kernel developers but like to run the
latest kernels come in.  Where do you think these kernels come from?
They don't grow on trees; People work hard to produce them.  I would
prefer to see the kernel developers coding rather than wasting large
amounts of time testing every config option.  It is the responsibility
of the rest of us to submit useful bug reports, and better yet, patches
for problems.  It works both ways, you see.  You get to use the
collective work of the kernel developers, essentially for free, but when
something fails it is *your* responsibility to do your part to at least
submit a bug report.  And submitting a bug report requires no particular
skill, so anyone can do it.  Granted, on an officially stable kernel,
compile errors should not occur, but if they do it is simply because
either no one (that means us) bothered to try out the pre series of
kernels leading up to it and report the problem.  So when a stable
kernel is released that has problems, it is *our* fault, because we
could have prevented it but didn't bother.

See above.

Linus has put his foot down on this issue and we should see at least
basic cardbus support in the kernel shortly. :-)

Details?  Details are the difference between a rant and something
helpful, useful, and constructive.  Also, does it really surprise you
that a development kernel in general, and one in which *major* changes
have been made and well publicized, in particular, might have some
problems in the areas directly involved in the changes.

See above.

It is not too much to expect other people to give you something that you
want, without your incurring even minimal responsibilities?

It is, in the final analysis.  It is so easy to simply expect the kernel
developers to do *all* of the work, since they have already done all
that they have done.  
Alas, no good deed goes unpunished...
