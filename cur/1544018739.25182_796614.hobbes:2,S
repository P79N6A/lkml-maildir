There is a race on namespaces that would have to be resolved.  From commit:
"... Currently (as pointed out by Oleg) do_task_stat has a race when calling
   task_pid_nr_ns with the task exiting.  In addition do_task_stat is not
   currently displaying information in the context of the pid namespace that
   mounted the /proc filesystem.  So "cut -d' ' -f 1 /proc/<pid>/stat" may not
   equal <pid>. ..."

It's not fully robust, the case of two simultaneous preaders on the
same fd isn't something I have any nice answer for given the nature of
seq_files.
Apart from that, as long as we maintain a separate f_pos for the
preads it should be ok.

Yes -- I mentioned above that to make this into a 'real' patch and
remain not perturb reads we'd need to maintain a second file position
for the preader
But this is getting farther up the ugly tree, I was hoping someone
else might have a more palatable idea :)
