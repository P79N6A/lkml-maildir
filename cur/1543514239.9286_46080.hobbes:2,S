I'd have to describe the protocol as broken in that case, and only
completely implementable in hardware rather than in software.

Just a thought, but "33 bit time periods" sounds like 8E1 or 8O1 and
"3 character periods". If such is the case, it shouldn't be hard to
handle. Let me go back to my original specification, and I'll reply to
that with additional comments including what I see for this...

Not quite, no.

My interpretation of that is that it is written in LEGALESE, and in
the said language, "may" and "should" do not exist since they are
considered to be too vague.
You may wish to submit a copy of the said specification to the Plain
English Campaign for comment: you will probably find their remarks
very instructive...

I'll have a look and see what is available there, and let you know...

You appear to have missed the point I was trying to make, so can I
rephrase it...

In other words, if Lose9x can't handle it, the bus is not likely to
succeed in its current form, so I would watch out for sudden changes
to the specification to enable said OS to support it.

I would be VERY surprised if there is ANYTHING that can't be supported
in Linux. Profibus is no exception to that.

Expectations of Windows may be irrelevant, but not expectations of the
forces that M$ can bring to bear to enable their OS's to support
something.
Best wishes from Riley.

    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
