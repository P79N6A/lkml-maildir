I have no idea about the probability, but in the one case I worry
about, a console is explicitly disabled because it is not wanted.
/dev does exist and is populated.

Yes, I thought about doing things at a different level as well.  If
there really is no console, shouldn't /dev/console have the same
behavious as /dev/null?
Point is that above patch is simpler and empiria didn't give me a
reason to worry about anything else.
