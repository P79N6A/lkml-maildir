what about providing a reasonable (not necessarily useful)
configuration for a minimal arm setup (maybe for each endianess)
and one for a maximal (read: as many as possible) options
selected which - and this is the important part - are known
and supposed to compile (regardless if they make sense or are
used in actual systems)?
this would allow regression tests, which in turn, might provide
valuable info about the involved subsystems, for both tollchain
and arm folks ...
if this isn't in _your_ interest, then maybe some specific
(considered representative) system defaults can be used instead
best,
