I (and many others) are doing it already in userspace. Don't you know 
about dm-crypt? I think the idea is described in its docs or wiki...
I also think that doing this in swapon is risky. Because nobody will 
guarantee you that random seed was restored before swapon and basing this
random key only on boot time and (rather deterministic) irqs at boot 
is risky IMHO.
In userspace, init scripts should make sure that random seed is restored 
before using /dev/random for anything.
