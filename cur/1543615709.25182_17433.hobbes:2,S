This is a piece of debug code - it's enabled by CONFIG_JBD_DEBUG,
and you can just disable that option to make the error go away.
The code in question is designed to tell the disk device driver
to start silently discarding all writes to the underlying device a
certain number of seconds after the filesystem is mounted.  This simulates
a machine crash.  It is for scripted crash+recovery testing.
The fix is:
