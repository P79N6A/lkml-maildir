	Hi;
	Ive been using -Os as my default compile flag under
Gentoo for probably over 2 years now. Havent noted any real
problems, and thats nearly 3gig of compressed source code
compiled on what is just my current system image.
	(Well, I might suck a little because I havent done any
benchmarks or comparisons as to the actual benifits of doing
so. Also, I use fvwm;)
