I tried what you said. But I must use a ugly method to adjust
idle->thread.esp (stack pointer in IA32). otherwise, the stack will soon
overflow after several rounds of hotplug. I'll take close look at if
other fields in thread_info cause problems.
Did you reinitialize the idle's thread_info in ppc? I have no problem to
do it in IA32, but is this a good approach? Creating a new idle thread
for upcoming CPU looks more graceful to me.
Thanks,
Shaohua
