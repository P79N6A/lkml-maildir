Please lets design against the transport or FSM of the storage transport
and never see data again.  NCITS specs generally (used loosely) define the
boundary conditions for stable operations.  One of jewels of linux in the
past which (hopefully was fixed, was 1.2.X-2.5.X thingy) was buffer_head
walking and release to satisfy transfer of data-blocks of a spindle
against the data-blocks of the kernel.  Spindle must win or one can not
insure data integrity, thus the advent of BIO's from BH.
Linux changed to conform to data integrity issues.
Somedays, Linux's API's or designs are OTS (Over The Shoulder).
You get crap all over your back, if you reach OTS to finish your washroom
business.  It is functional but ends up stinky and messy.
This thread is getting longer and I just added to piles ...
Sigh
