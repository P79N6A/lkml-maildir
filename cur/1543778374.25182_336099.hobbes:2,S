Thanks. I just checked .. that is right. So let me put it this way.
When ever I hot-plug my HBA into the system, the driver "qla2300" gets
loaded. Where as the correct driver is "qla2322". This evident from
the output of "modules.pcimap" file and "lspci". The PCI device number
of HBA is 2322. and in modules.pcimap file, qla2322 is supposed to be
loaded when this HBA is hot-plugged. But module qla2300 is getting
loaded.
Any pointers on where could the problem be? Or how should I approach
this problem?
Thanks a lot.

PS: For reference I am attaching the modules.pcimap file and lspci
output here again:
