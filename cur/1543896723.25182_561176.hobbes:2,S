That's not how it works, the enclosed symbols depend now on 
V4L_USB_DRIVERS, which is a boolean and it can only have two states.
It doesn't matter on what V4L_USB_DRIVERS depends only the final value 
matters.
(BTW if check the dependency debug output in menuconfig/xconfig, you'll 
see which values are relevant in the calculation of a symbol value.)

I don't know that without checking the Makefile.

Using bool is clearly a bug and I'd prefer if it removed the defaults as 
well.
