Hello:
    I have one question about standard PC(i386) resource (io port).
    I found we register these resource here:
        
http://lxr.linux.no/source/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c#L1185
    I want to read/write some data from PS/2 keyboard controller buffer
(IOW, from io port 0x60), and I guest that the buffer may corrupt in SMP
envionment if we access them without something like lock protect,
but I can not find any information or code related.
    Which great guru would like help me a little bit?
    Thanks in advanced.
