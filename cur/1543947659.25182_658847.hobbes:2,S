In the interest of having a safe release, I guess you're right.  It's 
unfortunate, though -- there's no good way to get thorough testing 
without putting the code in Linus's tree.

Below is my suggested approach, based on yours.  It might even solve
the MMC problem, who knows?  And it adds some potentially useful
debugging, although it would be better to dump just the stack of
suspending_task.  Do you know how to do that from within a timer
routine?
I still have no clear idea about what's going on with the ACPI bug in 
#9874.  However perhaps the bug wouldn't occur if we blocked device 
registration until after the resume was finished, instead of failing it 
outright.  Since the registration in this case was done in a workqueue 
thread, blocking wouldn't cause an immediate deadlock.
