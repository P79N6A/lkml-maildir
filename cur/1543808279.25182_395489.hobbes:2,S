That would be true except if Joerg hadn't started with the exact same
behavior. It would seem that Joerg would be capable of understanding
the irony there.
But maybe if Joerg would move his pride out of the way for 30 seconds,
have a decent look at the patch, return a technical commentary (or
point to an existing one), we could move on. I am sure that Matthias
would be pretty happy to return a better patch. That would make
everybody happy.
Matthias, can you resend the patch, without your notice? Let's see if
Joerg look at it this time.

Anonymous submission is not good for tracability reasons...
