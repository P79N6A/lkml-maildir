Subject: [PATCH 10/10] uml: fix compile warning after consolidation patch

The header declaring this function wasn't included, so the function declaration
was totally bogus wrt. the proto - even if this wasn't going to fail at all.
It was so bad that the compile warning I got was "control reaches end of
non-void function", i.e. missing return. Actually, this has been there for ages,
the consolidation patch just added the warning which was needed to clean it up.
Nice. Really.
