Liam,
I have a rough peek into the git tree on opensource.wolfsonmicro.com,
find another PMIC framework, and here instead is a regulator framework,
looks like a simplified or dedicated one. What is their relationship?
For those PMIC that covers additional features, like
  - usb vbus detection (or pull-up/pull-down)
  - audio codec
  - touch screen
  - battery monitor/ fuel gauge
  - battery charger
  - possible many others
How do you plan to handle them?
