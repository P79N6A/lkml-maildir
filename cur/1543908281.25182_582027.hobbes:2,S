Well, current behaviour is that all packets get always timestamped if
the socket has a reception ring. We are just activating it a bit sooner
at the setsockopt(SOL_PACKET, PACKET_RX_RING) call instead of waiting
until the reception of the first packet. And current applications can't
disable it if we use a new socket option. So I can see how an
application can break.

Is SO_TIMESTAMP2 a valid name? I can't imagine how to call it.
