Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Intro: convert lockd to kthread and fix use-after-free (try #3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is the third patchset to fix the use-after-free problem in lockd,
and to convert lockd to use the kthread API instead of kernel_thread.
The main change from the last patchset is the elimination of the
svc_create_kthread helper function, and having lockd_up call kthread_run
directly. I've also made some changes to the function prototype for
the lockd function to eliminate the need for casting the function
pointer.
Tested against the reproducer I have for the main issue (detailed in
patch #7). As always, comments and suggestions are appreciated.
