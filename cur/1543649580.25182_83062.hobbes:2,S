That depends on how it compares to async read/write, which hasn't 
been looked into yet.  The way the pipe code worked involved walking 
the page tables, which is still quite expensive for small data sizes.  
With the new code, the CPU's tlb will be used, which will make a big 
difference, especially for the case where only a single address space 
is in use on the system.
