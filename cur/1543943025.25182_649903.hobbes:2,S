Good idea.

Can you structure this example so as to encourage people to use the
more formatted read/write routines, such as read_int64 and
write_int64?

Maybe add a comment here that mentions that if your cgroup needs very
early initialization, you can check for cg->parent being NULL, and
return a statically-constructed structure here. (And set
foo_subsys.early_init = 1)
