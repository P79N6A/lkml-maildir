This could easily be supported by removing the requirement that 16 
minors are used per disk.  If instead, partition minors were dynamcially 
allocated and created by userspace policies (or devfs), many thousands 
of disks could be used in the current scheme (assuming they don't have a 
bunch of partitions).  I think it is unlikely anyone would actually use 
more then one partition in a big disk setup, but I could be wrong.   If 
only one minor were used per disk, 10k disks could easily be supported 
by the current dev_t.
Of course, the way block devices that represent disks register with the 
system would have to change, but the current waste of minors by devices 
that never exist is rediculous anyway.
Thanks
