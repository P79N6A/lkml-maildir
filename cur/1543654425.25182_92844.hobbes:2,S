Erm. Whats going on here ?
(davej@tetrachloride:davej)$ ls .viminfo
ls: .viminfo: No such file or directory
(davej@tetrachloride:davej)$ touch .viminfo
touch: creating `.viminfo': File exists
(davej@tetrachloride:davej)$ 
strace of the touch..
brk(0x8050000)                          = 0x8050000
open(".viminfo", O_WRONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_CREAT|O_NOCTTY|O_LARGEFILE, 0666) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
utime(".viminfo", NULL)                 = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
write(2, "touch: ", 7touch: )                  = 7
write(2, "creating `.viminfo\'", 19creating `.viminfo')    = 19
write(2, ": File exists", 13: File exists)           = 13
write(2, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
_exit(1)                                = ?
strace of the ls...
lstat64(".viminfo", 0x80580ac)          = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
write(2, "ls: ", 4ls: )                     = 4
.viminfo is actually there, and does show up with bash's tab completion.
Weird.
