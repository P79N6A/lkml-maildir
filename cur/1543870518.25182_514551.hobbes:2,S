We would need additional measures such as real defrag and make more 
structure movable.

Yes, we (SGI) need exactly that: Use of higher order pages in the kernel 
in order to reduce overhead of managing page structs for large I/O and 
large memory applications. We need appropriate measures to deal with the 
fragmentation problem.

We need to reduce the real hardware zones as much as possible. Most high 
performance architectures have no need for additional DMA zones f.e. and
do not have to deal with the complexities that arise there.

Well you cannot get there without the nodes. The control of memory 
allocations with user space support etc only comes with the nodes.

No merge them to one thing and handle them as one. No difference between 
zones and nodes anymore.

Yes that would mean merging nodes and zones. So "nones".
