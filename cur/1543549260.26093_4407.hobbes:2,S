This is good. It would be useful to have this in place ASAP so driver
authors have something to look at and to work against.
I've made some edits (revised patch attached here).
* With this interface I don't see a way in which one can force some
settings but leave others unforced.  Suppose, for example, that I wish
to force 10mbps but to leave the setting of the transceiver type,
duplex, etc alone (ie: up to the driver/hardware to determine the value
of these).
If you do an ETHTOOL_SSET/modify/ETHTOOL_SGET on the interface you'll
end up *forcing* all these settings into whatever state they happened to
be in when you did the read, no?
So I added the `force_mask' which should be tested by the ETHTOOL_SSET
handler to decide which fields are actually being forced.
When the driver receives a ETHTOOL_SGET it should populate `force_mask'
to indicate to the caller which fields are currently forced.
* I added SUPPORTED_MAC_FLOWCTRL/ADVERTISED_MAC_FLOWCTRL for advertising
of 802.3x MAC-layer flow control.
* I added the `flow_ctrl' field to say whether we want to enable/disable
this.
Other comments:
* There don't seem to be enough port types and transceiver types. 
10base2? BNC? 100baseTx/100baseFX?
* Regarding the ADVERTISED bits.  Are these designed to read back what
we're currently advertising, or are they designed to allow us to force
what is to be advertised?  Both, I guess.
* maxtxpkt and maxrxpkt seem highly specific to particular hardware and
particular drivers.  Plus there are a large range of other
driver-specific performance tunables which are typically controlled by
module parms.  Why pick these two?
It may be better to bury this sort of thing into a device-specific
anonymous field.  Shrug - don't bother: I wouldn't expect anyone to
really use these things because it's such a PITA to tear down all the
driver data structures and rebuild them.
* Are you really, really sure about the alignment issues with struct
ethtool_cmd?  It strikes me that burying a short and five chars in among
a bunch of longs is asking for trouble.  Suppose the caller is using a
different compiler?  If you're not sure, make 'em all u32 :)
On a related topic, it offends me that when you unplug the RJ45 from a
win2k machine it pops up a little box telling you your network has
disappeared.  We can't do that.
At present, SIOCGIFFLAGS returns an amalgam of __LINK_STATE_START and
__LINK_STATE_NOCARRIER in IFF_RUNNING.  We need to separate these out so
applications can query __LINK_STATE_NOCARRIER independently.  We also
need a select()able interface so changes in carrier can be monitored.
The users of a select()able carrier detect would be desktop UIs and the
high-availability guys.  The latter is a guess - I don't really know if
people who are concerned about failover would find a carrier-lost
indication useful.  TBD.--- linux-2.4.0-test9-pre4/include/linux/ethtool.h	Thu Jan  1 10:00:00 1970
