You have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y. Say your module is using printk(). So your 
module needs to know the checksum for printk(). This checksum is generated 
during the build of kernel/printk.c and then propagated into vmlinux, 
which is where the module build gets it from.
That's why you need printk.o / vmlinux to build the module. If you 
don't want these checks, turn of CONFIG_MODVERSIONS and it's back to what 
it used to be.
