Unfortunately the firewall is _NOT_ free, I've been paid for developing
the firewall.
The software developed by me - mainly configuration procedures, and the
proxies - isn't freely available.
I will publish the freeware packages and their URLs we used to build this
firewall and how to configure it, also the patches for kernel and the
packages on my website
 
http://www.linux-firewall.de
    (in german for now)
Also there are set up some links regarding Internet security.
Anyone who wants to build up a firewall of his own can take this as a starting
point to do so. But be warned - it takes a long time.
Anyone who wants to have a demo of the firewall or wants to purchase it,
can obtain my address, phone and fax number from my website.
Feel free to contact me, Email is preferred (Subject: linuxwall), flames are
silently discarded.
