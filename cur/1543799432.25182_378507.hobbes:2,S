I think plist_head is much better than pl_head.
However I think plist_empty/plist_unhashed is more accurate
than plist_head_empty/plist_node_empty, but I am rather
agnostic to naming.
Ingo, do you have any preferences?
Daniel, it would be great if you can check that kernel/rt.o
was not changed after rename (as it should be).
Oleg.
