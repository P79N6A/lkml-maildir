| Oh, one other thing.  An updated patch for 2.4.20 is up:

Hi Robert:
Thanks for the reply and the patch. I'll give the 2.4.20-2 patch a shot.
If I'm still seeing the leak after applying it, I'll do my best to track
it down (I already know it's somewhere in the fork() path, just based on
the mean-time-before-death of a few test scripts I was playing with).
I probably won't be able to isolate it down to a single line; I should,
however, be able to capture enough information so that someone with far
more awareness of the kernel's guts than I can track it down. :)
Thanks again,
- Dave
