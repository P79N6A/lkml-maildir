Since the non-wroking drive is a different model, other drive working
does not mean the st driver is sending only valid commands to the
drives. st driver is sending a command to this drive which the drive
does not like. It will help to know what that command is.

This is a compile time option, so you will have to recompile "st"
driver. If you look at drivers/scsi/st.c, near the top of the file (line
44 for 2.4.2) you will see a line
#define DEBUG 0
Change this line to set DEBUG to 1 and recompile. This may generate lot
of messages from Test Unit Ready and Mode Sense commands. You can
suppress these messages by replacing the code block within "if
(debugging)" conditional at line 241 with following:
if (SRpnt->sr_cmnd[0] != MODE_SENSE &&
                     SRpnt->sr_cmnd[0] != TEST_UNIT_READY) {
                printk(ST_DEB_MSG "st%d: Error: %x, cmd: %x %x %x %x %x
%x Len: %d\n",
                       dev, result,
                       SRpnt->sr_cmnd[0], SRpnt->sr_cmnd[1],
SRpnt->sr_cmnd[2],
                       SRpnt->sr_cmnd[3], SRpnt->sr_cmnd[4],
SRpnt->sr_cmnd[5],
                       SRpnt->sr_bufflen);
                if (driver_byte(result) & DRIVER_SENSE)
                        print_req_sense("st", SRpnt);
}
