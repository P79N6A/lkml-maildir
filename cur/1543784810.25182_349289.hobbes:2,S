James:
I noticed that you recently posted some updates to the klist code, 
although I haven't looked to see how you are using the klists.
What do you think about eliminating klists entirely, and instead using 
regular lists protected by either a mutex or an rwsem?  It would remove a 
good deal of overhead, and I think it wouldn't be hard to convert the 
driver core.  Would this be feasible for the things you're doing?
