It's worse than that, actually.
Your old device no longer working is not a neutral thing
for the manufacturer, but actually a GOOD thing, since
you will be forced to buy a new device - one that has a
driver for a new version of the OS.
Binary only drivers are a good way to ensure that devices
become obsolete sooner than they would otherwise.  Not so
good for users, though...
