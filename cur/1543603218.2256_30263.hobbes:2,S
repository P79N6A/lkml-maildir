Hi everyone,
	Just a quick question: Is it possible for an average person (like me) to 
download from somewhere, single .c files from the latest stable kernel? I 
only need a few files from the 2.4.9 or .10 release and I'm really not keen 
on downloading all 27Mb. :) Any info on this would be great.
