Thanks, yes I shall look up both these..at first glance they do look 
promising.
One thing i'd like to point out though, Greg: the LM70 is an 
SPI/Microwire based system and not i2c; so straight away, the i2c 
interface by itself will not be used...; also, the specific board 
(LM70CILD-3, which i've written the 2.4 driver for & am now porting to 
2.6), comes with a built-in parport interface..so that's what the driver 
takes into account of course..
Also it's a relatively simple temperature sensor - it does not seem to 
support hysteresis temperature, i/p voltages, etc. I'm saying all this 
as the sysfs interface i envision is just a simple read-only hook: the 
o/p value (after a little userspace massaging) is the temperature in 
Celsius correct to 0.25 degrees. So it looks to me that this particular 
driver necessitates a kind-of "custom" entry under /sys/class/hwmon with 
it's own userspace support. Do I move ahead in this direction?
Regards,
kaiwan.
