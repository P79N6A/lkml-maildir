Note that I'm probably going to remove the 1G split.
The 3GB user-space is better for users, and with BIGMEM support the
advantages of 2G kernels are much less anyway. I don't see any horribly
compelling reasons for showing that particular difference to users any
more: the 2G split was a hack to avoid doing bigmem, but now...
This is especially true now that I have fairly clean patches from Ingo to
take the BIGMEM stuff up to 64GB - the difference of whether you can
directly map 1GB or 2GB of that physical memory is negligible, as 95% of
the memory will be high anyway on the big boxes.
I kind of like the notion of having SMP and UP modules co-exist nicely,
but I do not enjoy the thought of then adding other random differences
too.. SMP vs UP is kind of fundamental, while 1G vs 2G definitely isn't.
