The driver means it when it says "ISA irqs".  A value of 27 is not
valid for cs_irq because this is an ISA irq number and must be 0..15;
this is not a property of the host system, this is a property of the
i82365 register specification.  PCI interrupts have to be handled
differently (well, the stripped-down i82365 driver just can't handle
them at all)
