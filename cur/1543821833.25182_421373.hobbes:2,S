Hi All
I am working on Real-time streaming Applications, which is using
various Buffer Models, Can any one help in understanding the exact
_scenario_ to use these flow control mechanisms,
1) Circular Buffer.
2) Low Water Mark Mechanism with DMA.
3) Ping Pong Handshake. (or) Double Buffering.
Or please direct me a source.
Thanks,
Deven
