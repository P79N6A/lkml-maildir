Like Kyle said, this depends to some extent on the system.  However, 
during Suspend-to-RAM it is definitely true that the RAM at least is 
powered on.  Other components may be powered as well.  Otherwise you 
wouldn't be able to awaken the system by pressing a button/opening the 
case/whatever.

Sorry, but you're wrong.  First of all, testing if hardware is there is
different from testing whether it has changed -- it could have changed 
while the system was asleep, with the result that hardware is indeed there 
but it's not the _same_ hardware.
Second, with USB at any rate, in addition to checking that hardware is 
still there, the kernel queries the USB controller to see if a disconnect 
occurred while the system was asleep.  (If the controller wasn't powered 
during that time then it will report that every USB device was 
disconnected.)
Third, there is indeed something special that monitors USB device 
insertion/removal while suspended to RAM -- the USB host controller does 
so if it has suspend power.

No.  It does work exactly as designed and it's not buggy.  You just don't
understand it.

Don't be silly.  Dirty pages can't be flushed to disks that are no longer
attached!  And if a USB disk was unplugged while the system was asleep,
the kernel will know that it is no longer attached.  I don't know which
other bus drivers check for this sort of thing.

It's not a bug if the device _has_ been unplugged and reconnected.  When 
that happens, there's no way for the kernel to tell whether the device 
there now is the same as the device that used to be there.
