Then I don't think it's smbmount, but smbfs. The inode is considered
"good" for a certain amount of time (5 seconds I read somewhere) so you
will not see changes made by others unless, whatever the magic time is,
has passed since you will see the cached inode.
Would that explain what you are seeing?

oplocks turned on should make this worse since it allows clients to the NT
server to cache changes. This will make it take longer for the changes to
appear to the other clients. If your client does no caching of read data
you should see changes "immediately" (maybe they were talking about
smbclient, assuming that does not cache anything).
