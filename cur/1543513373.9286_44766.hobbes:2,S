    I think I'm beginning to get a handle on this -- the hard hangs
(in 2.3.x), and some other problems with /proc/tty/driver/serial,
seem to stem from drivers/char/serial.c .
    I get no hanging if I don't invoke an X client called "xgauge"
(homebrew); the one in question displays serial r/w rates, and reads
/proc/tty/driver/serial every 500 millisecs.  (I thought I had ruled
out X clients as what was hitting this, but apparently I missed this.)
    And I see other problems reading /proc/tty/driver/serial with
any utility ("Bad address", garbage, and, behold, a kernel oops).
So I'm going to post further news under a subject line referencing
/proc/tty/driver/serial .
    One more teaser here -- I see from working on the oops that %eax
seems to be fubar when rs_read_proc() (drivers/char/serial.c) calls
line_info() and serial_in() (both are inline).  More later.
