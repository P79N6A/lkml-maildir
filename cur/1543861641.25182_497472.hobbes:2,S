Duh.  I forgot Nvidia provided a register like that, now I am
beginning to understand what is wrong.  Anyway we do try apic0 pin0 by
default on the Nvidia's because of a Nvidia specific work around.
So that doesn't invalidate the generic test.  I'm going to go dig
out what little information I have and see if I can stair at the
register definition.
Anyway that doesn't invalidate anything in this patch.
