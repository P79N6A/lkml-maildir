Not too sure which list to send this to exactly so here goes. I go
my laptop back from warranty repair and it was returned with an old
version of the bios that still had suspend-2-disk capability in it.
Having set everything up I hit the suspend button and all seemed to
go ok upto a point:
==mutt entered refrigerator
=mutt entered refrigerator
=mutt entered refrigerator
=mutt entered refrigerator
=mutt entered refrigerator
=mutt entered refrigerator
=mutt entered refrigerator
=tail entered refrigerator
=
 stopping tasks failed (2 tasks remaining)
Suspend failed: Not all processes stopped!
Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, rpciod not stopped
 Strange, lockd not stopped
XFree86 left refrigerator
init left refrigerator
khubd left refrigerator
then it kept unfreezing my tasks till the following debug stuff 
came up:
tail left refrigerator
pdflush left refrigerator
 done

Laptop seems to be working fine still. X and networking are going ok. The
nfs mounts still function (laptop is a client with 3 nfs mounts).

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
