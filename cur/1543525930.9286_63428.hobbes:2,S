Larry's idea is not currently in the marketplace.
<quote from Larry McVoy>
One thing that I've dreamed about for a while is getting the disk drive 
vendors to put STP down in the drives. Then we throw out the SCSI/IDE 
cables and use RJ45 connectors to talk to both the network and the disks. 
Think hot plug. Cool, no?

The genre of products emerging in the market such as Cobalt's NasRaq all
currently use standard disk drive interfaces. These products simply add
value by integrating a system around these disk drive(s), which utilize
the existing industry wide disk drive interface standards. There is no
modification of the actual disk drive interface.
