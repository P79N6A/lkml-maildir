Ok, i applied it to my 2.4.12 (no patches besides these) kernel. I never had 
any stability problems with the HPT so the value of my testing might be 
limited. For what its worth, i didn't notice any degradation in performance 
or any other unwanted effects. I also applied the ide-pci.c patch mentioned 
on another thread. I was triyng (and still am) to fix the CoD !=0 in 
idescsi_pc_intr message that always ruins my cd burning efforts. But that 
apparently is not related to the HPT because it also happens on my Promise 
ULTRA66. The only controller who doesn't do this is the VIA onboard 
controller.
PS: HW Info: Abit VP6 2x PIII-1GHz 1GB SDRAM
PS2: You wouldn't by any chance know what that CoD !=0 msg means ?
