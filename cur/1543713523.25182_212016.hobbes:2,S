Intuitive isn't the issue, if you can't figure out why you can't turn 
off SCSI, you leave it on, which you need to make USB storage work. If 
you're trying to make a small kernel you presumably would have turned 
off USB if you didn't want it. The other way, if you can turn on USB w/o 
SCSI, it won't work, and people thing Linux is broken.
The issue is that what we have works but it's not obvious why, vs. 
doesn't work and also isn't obvious why. Thank you, work by default is 
better.

Chances are that most people wouldn't have USB on if they didn't want 
it, but there's no downside to doing this.

I thought that was what (a) did.

Compared to enabling USB storage with no hope of having it work? Adding 
user info is desirable, but making it easy, or even possible, to build a 
  non-working config is a lot more of a problem. You haven't compiled on 
a slow machine lately, forcing config combinations which work is a 
benefit of kconfig.
If you want it broken you have to edit the config code. That's a good thing.
