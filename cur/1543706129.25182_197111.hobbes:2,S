Hi,
> Can you try this patch instead pretty please ;)
Still had the active rebalance problem. Martin suggested I try just the
first junk of his patch:
@@ -1442,8 +1442,8 @@ nextgroup:
        if ((long)*imbalance < 0)
                *imbalance = 0;
  
-       /* Get rid of the scaling factor now, rounding *up* as we divide */
-       *imbalance = (*imbalance + SCHED_LOAD_SCALE - 1) >> SCHED_LOAD_SHIFT;
+       /* Get rid of the scaling factor now */
+       *imbalance = *imbalance >> SCHED_LOAD_SHIFT;
This fixed the active rebalance issue, however now it doesnt want to
rebalance out of the node. Ive got one completely empty node and one full
one (all primary and secondary threads are busy).
