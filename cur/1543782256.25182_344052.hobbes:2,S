It's how the kernel _should_ work, but very few apps seem to depend on it, 
so no guarantees. I looked over the code, and I think we've lost the 
SIGBUS thing.
Basically, if you don't ever access past the end, you should always be ok.  
If you access past the end, at least some _really_ old kernel versions
will zero-fill the page with an anonymous page and lose coherency, while
more modern kernels should _either_ cause a SIGBUS or alternatively at 
least have a coherent zero-filled page.
