Only the pages of the file that are actually accessed are loaded into 
physical memory.  This mapping just reserves a slot of virtual memory 
for those demand loaded pages to be mapped.

Private mapping means copy-on-write.  But since these mappings are 
read-only they will still be shared by other users of that file.  So no 
extra physical memory for each process mapping the file.
