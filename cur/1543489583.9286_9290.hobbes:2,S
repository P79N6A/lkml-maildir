   What's the standard C library?
   libc4?
   libc5?
   glibc2?
   glibc2.1?
   I still use libc4, and as far as I know I'm the only person
   on this planet that's actually maintaining it.  What's the chance
   of me putting such a hack in, given that my warranty will run out
   in 30-50 years and I've already committed to, oh, about 80 years
   worth of code?

   If you're going to take out symbolic links, there's no point in even
   pretending that symbolic links exist.   Not everyone will use your C
   library, and replacing symbolic links with Windows-style .lnk files
   will cheerfully break a large body of code that non surprisingly
   expects that a symbolic link will try really hard to look like a
   file.

   david parsons \bi/ everyone converts to the latest libc?  Oh, that's
                  \/                                         a good one.
