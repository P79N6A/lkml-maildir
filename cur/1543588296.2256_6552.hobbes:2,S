Of course, but this is a result from sloppy coding. In general, open()
can just return anything and about the only case where you can even
think of ignoring its result is this:
 close(0); close(1); close(2);
 open("/dev/null", O_RDWR); dup(0); dup(0);
(which is even not clean for other reasons).
I can't imagine depending on the "fact" that the first fd I open is 3,
the next is 4, etc. And what if the routine in question is not
malloc() but e.g. getpwuid()? Both are just arbitrary library
functions, and one of them clearly does open file descriptors,
depending on their implementation.
What would the reason[1] be for wanting contiguous fd space anyway?
