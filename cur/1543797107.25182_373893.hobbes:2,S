That's true as far as it goes.  But it ignores the possibility that, for
example, the critical section is extremely short (like incrementing an
integer variable).  In such situations, spinning is better than
scheduling.  And even better than spinning is for the CPU to wait while
another CPU carries out a locked bus cycle (which is what atomic_t
operations do on x86).  As well as being more efficient, it may even be
"cleaner" -- depending on one's personal taste.  :-)
