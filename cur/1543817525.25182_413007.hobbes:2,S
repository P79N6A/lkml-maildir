Hi,
I've made a patch to remove all EXPORT_SYMBOL's that aren't used in the
kernel; it's too big for the list so it can be found at
http://www.kernelmorons.org/unexport.patch
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 34476416 Apr  1 21:59 vmlinux.before
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 34378112 Apr  1 22:48 vmlinux.after
As you can see this saves 98Kb kernel size... that's not peanuts.
