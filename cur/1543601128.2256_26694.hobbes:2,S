Only the PPC-based gemini board uses that driver (ncr885e) and Val is the
maintainer of that board.  These patches that she sent fix yellowfin.c for
the ncr885e chip on the big-endian PPC.  I just pointed at the junk pile,
Val is actually doing the work to put the ncr885e drivers there.
This is a truly rare patch, it allows the removal of entire drivers
not just a few lines.  As an encore I suggest combining the >5 Zilog 8530
drivers.
} I may be missing some context... have you tested yellowfin on big endian
} boxes?  If so, go ahead and remove it.  Cort said it was destined for
} the scrapheap a while ago, and IIRC it disappeared from the 'ac' tree
} for a while...
