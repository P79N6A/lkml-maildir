I do not suggest that copyright subsists in the signature or in the
signing key.  Whether it does is irrelevant to the signing key being
part of the source code (when the signature is needed for the binary
to work properly).
Similarly, copyright might not subsist in a simple linker script --
its content being determined by the operating system and perhaps the
rest of the program's source code -- but under the GPL, the linker
script would be part of the source code for a compiled version.
