Sorry for the late,
The kernel I'm testing is 2.6.21.7, just because our testing cluster
suite is from the last month when cluster-2.01 from here didn't come
out,
ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/cluster/releases/
So now we were keeping testing on kernel 2.6.21.y series, just for its
stability, I don't know how about the stability of 2.6.22.y, I haven't
tested it yet.
So the problem I said has been fixed in later kernel after 2.6.22,
please feel free to let me know.

I'll try it. Thanks.
