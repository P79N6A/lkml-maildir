Slowass 2 has a tmpfs because their UFS implementation is dog slow. So
they had to do hack up tmpfs to give them a faster /tmp.
With Linux extfs, it runs as fast as Solaris tmpfs, so there doesn't
seem much point in a tmpfs implemtation for Linux. If you really want
a memory-based FS, you may as well just put an ext2fs in a ramdisc.
