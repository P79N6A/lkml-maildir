whether %fs/%gs is 0 or not? With the current 2.5.3-pre6 task switching
code there definitely is a performance difference, because we optimize the
'both values are 0' case. With the original TSS-based task switching
microcode i suspect it made a difference as well. (switching between two
different %fs/%gs values should be slower.)
