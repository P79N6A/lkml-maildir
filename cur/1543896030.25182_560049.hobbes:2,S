Hi Renato,
this signalizes something is wrong between the device and HID layer - it 
could be both the report descriptor of the device being wrong, or some bug 
in hid-input that is not triggered by any other device.
Could you please send me the report descriptor of the device, so that I 
could debug it locally here?
The report descriptor should be present in your HID_DEBUG dump, but you 
don't seem to have provided in any of the previous mails. The relevant 
line in dmesg should look similar to:
report descriptor (size 61, read 54) = 05 0b 09 05 a1 01 05 09 19 11 29 18 
15 00 25 01 75 01 95 08 81 22 05 08 09 3a a1 02 05 09 19 11 29 17 15 00 25 
01 75 01 95 07 b1 a2 c0 06 ff ff 09 01 15 00 25 01 75 01 95 01 b1 22 c0
