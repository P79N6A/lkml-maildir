	It "depends", as the saying goes.
	SPARC (like Motorola 68000 series) is big-endian, and if
	the system were as bad as you imply in that kind of hardware,
	then you would not be reading any of the Linux lists now
	going thru vger.rutgers.edu.

	For you I would be more carefull when claiming something like
	that...    As far as I know, all truly commonly used drivers
	(including most of the ones using PCI bus) are written using
	platform hiding interface macroes.  (For example there are
	THREE (or four?) ways of doing inb() in different Alpha systems.)
	(Mind you, there is the dimension of little-/big-endianity,
	 but also 32/64 bit issues harm some drivers.)
	Having touched a lot of drivers in Linux kernel, I do know
	that there are ones which you don't get to *any* other than
	their original intel based platform.  Said drivers, however,
	are an exception.
	Now a semi-embedded SH4 -- how much there might in the end be
	hardware easily drivable with existing drivers ?
	Filesystems work just fine (EXT2, MINIX, RAMDISK, NFS, ROMFS),
	as does the networking, basic memory management, scheduling, ...
	Driving e.g. IDE, serial ports, LEDs will likely need full-
	custom interface chip drivers.
	If the SH4 does not have a MMU, then things may get a bit more
	sticky -- it will be hard, if not outright impossible, to run
	fully in usermode residing processes.
