Hello,
here are a few submillisecond latencies.
First, the lspci of the machine (which is different from the one I just posted 
about).

First, the 3c59x Ethernet card seems to cause 450us latencies :

http://po.gaillard.free.fr/latency/latency_trace.3c59x.txt
Then the e1000 driver seems to cause 200us latencies :
http://po.gaillard.free.fr/latency/latency_bt.e1000_stats.txt
http://po.gaillard.free.fr/latency/latency_trace.e1000_stats.txt
Since the other machine with an Intel e1000 controller, shows a twice smaller 
latency, I post its lpsci entry for the controller  (note that latency is twice 
smaller) :
02:0a.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82541EI Gigabit Ethernet Controller 
(Copper)
         Subsystem: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 1213
         Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 22
         Memory at f2000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
         I/O ports at b400 [size=64]
         Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 2
         Capabilities: [e4] PCI-X non-bridge device.
  and thank you to Ingo for the speedy response to the console issue. I applied 
the patch and the kernel is compiling.
