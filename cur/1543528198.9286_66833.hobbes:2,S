!! Surely you jest :-)
Usually I get around problems like this by passing `echo *` into head or
tail +N etc. xargs isn't an option due to the massive startup times of
our custom commands.
This is actually a small example... we often have more files than this
:-)
There must be a nasty limit somewhere... I just want to be able to
increase it. Or even better, to make it dynamically adjust while we've
got lots of memory.
cheers
