Trying to look at this from a legal point of view. GPLv3 might actually 
contradict GPLv2.
GPLv3 is more RESTRICTIVE than v2. With v2 you didn't have the new 
anti-DRM and anti-patent restrictions. The original license says 
somewhere that you can't change the license to be more restrictive.
None of us like patents and DRM but language that places new 
restrictions on software might not be GPLv2 compatible. Stallman might 
need to call his new license something else than GPL if he's going to 
add language that adds restrictions.
I can see an argument where GPLv2 prohibits GPLv3.
