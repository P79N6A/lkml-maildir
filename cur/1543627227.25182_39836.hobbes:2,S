Hi everyone,
I'm not sure that this is the correct list for this question,
so I apologise if you think so.
Basically I want to understand the process of NFS mounting
in terms of network activity and transactions from client
to server.
 From my understanding basically the client requests the mountd
port from the servers portmapper.
Then the client talks to mountd
etc etc etc..
Well the problem I have is that it seems that mountd is trying to
establish a new UDP connection (yeah yeah i know...) to the mount
client process. Is this what is supposed to happen?
Cheers
Dave
