Hello List,
Since installing 2.6.6 on my trusty laptop, I can't use the built-in synaptics
touchpad anymore. The tracking is totally broken:
When you touch-drag on the touchpad, the mouse cursor will jump to where you
stopped your action approx. 1/1.5 seconds _after_ your move. This makes using
the touchpad virtually impossible.
This problem is not present under 2.6.5, which I'm running right now.
Same .config.
Nothing seems to show up in the logs that could reflect any problem.
Any pointers?
Jan
