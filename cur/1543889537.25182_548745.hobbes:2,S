I'm going to change that "BUG:" to "WARNING:". 
I know some people disagreed with it (ie Ingo), but I think that's total 
and utter bullshit.
It's a warning. Right now that "BUG:" message makes people all scared 
about something that is not fatal at all, just a note that something 
hasn't been converted, but is expected to work absolutely fine.
Calling it a bug is idiotic.
