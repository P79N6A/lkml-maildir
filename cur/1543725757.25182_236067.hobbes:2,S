All the facts I needed to know were in the original post.  You had to
reverse engineer a network driver because Nvidia would not release
specs.  We should not be having to reverse engineer a 10/100 ethernet
controller in 2004.  The Linux community should make noise when vendors
do this.

This is pretty shoddy on their part.  Like I said, I can understand not
wanting to release the specs for their GFX cards, but a freaking 10/100
ethernet controller is ridiculous.
