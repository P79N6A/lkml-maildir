But it isn't *really* constant time lookups? I mean you'll
always have the O(logn) lookup. Amortised I guess that
becomes insignificant?
Briefly: is there a reason why you couldn't use gang lookups
instead? (Sorry I haven't been able to read and understand your
actual readahead code).

OK, I guess that seems reasonable.
You have introduced some other APIs as well...
Profile numbers would be great for the cached / non-cached cases.
