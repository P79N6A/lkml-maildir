Broken userland code.  You expect read() to return a multiple of PROCLEN,
for one thing.  For another, you have (several lines below) a broken
loop termination logics.
EOF had been reached when read() returns 0.  Until then read() returns
an arbitrary amount of bytes between 1 and 'size' argument.  Since you
are using read(2) directly, use it correctly...
