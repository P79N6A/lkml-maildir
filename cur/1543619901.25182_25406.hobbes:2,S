Subject: [patch] kernel/ptrace.c, kernel 2.4.17 Fix for PTRACE_POKETEXT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

	When access_process_vm is used in kernel/ptrace.c to write memory
to a debugged we were not correctly incrementing an address used to handle
memory faults. This meant that in some cases modifying memory in a child
process of a fork modified the memory of the parent as well. This patch
applies to version 2.4.17.
