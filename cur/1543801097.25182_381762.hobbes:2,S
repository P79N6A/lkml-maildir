[PATCH] Allow overlapping resources for platform devices
There are cases in which a device's memory mapped registers overlap
with another device's memory mapped registers.  On several PowerPC
devices this occurs for the MDIO bus, whose registers tended to overlap
with one of the ethernet controllers.
By switching from request_resource to insert_resource we can register
the MDIO bus as a proper platform device and not hack around how we
handle its memory mapped registers.
