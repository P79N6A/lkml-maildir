LDT takes from 1 to 16 pages. and is allocated by vmalloc.
do you propose to replace it with slab which can fail due to memory
fragmentation?
the same applies to fdset, fdarray, ipc ids and iptables entries.

It seems a silly for you since 2nd patchset accounting user pages
is not here yet. As you can see we added a union into page,
which is shared between kernel memory and user memory accounting.
THERE IS NOT USER ACCOUNTING HERE YET GUYS! :) THIS FIELD WILL BE USED!!!
