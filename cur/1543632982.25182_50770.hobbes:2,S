My server lost dns for several hours a couple of weeks back.  Since then 
I have made several unsuccessful attempts at getting back on the 
linux-kernel list serv.  As far as I can tell I was unsubscribed durign 
my dns outage.
I started reading the available FAQs and came across the MX record 
verfication form at 
http://vger.kernel.org/mxverify.html
:
The results seem incorrect: 
http://vger.kernel.org/cgi-bin/mxverify-cgi?DOMAIN=greg@destiney.com&SUBMIT=Submit
+to+VGER.KERNEL.ORG
Testing MX server: mail.destiney.com
--- sorry, address lookup for ``mail.destiney.com'' failed;
code = Temporary failure in name resolution
But when I try my domain from any other server I have no issues:
firewall:~$ nslookup mail.destiney.com
Server:  sun00bna.bna.bellsouth.net
Address:  205.152.150.254
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    destiney.com
Address:  207.65.176.133
Aliases:  mail.destiney.com
+-(destiney@gateway)
+-(~)> nslookup mail.destiney.com
Server:         68.52.0.5
Address:        68.52.0.5#53
Non-authoritative answer:
mail.destiney.com       canonical name = destiney.com.
Name:   destiney.com
Address: 207.65.176.133
Can anyone help me to get back subscribed to linux-kernel?
Thanks in advance.
