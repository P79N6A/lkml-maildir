Uhh. There are already numerous other issues why the VM is failing that is 
independent of Peter's approach.

Theoretical bugs? Depends on one's creativity to come up with them I 
guess. So far we do not even get around to address the known issues and 
this multi subsystem patch has the potential of creating more.

Using the VM to throttle networking is a pretty bad thing because it 
assumes single critical user of memory. There are other consumers of 
memory and if you have a load that depends on other things than networking 
then you should not kill the other things that want memory.
