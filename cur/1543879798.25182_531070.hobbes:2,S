Chuckle, ROTFLMAO even.
I didn't run it that long as I immediately rebuilt and rebooted when I found 
I'd used the wrong patch, and in fact had tested that one and found it 
sub-optimal before I'd built and ran Con's -0.40 version.  As for bugs of the 
type that make it to the screen or logs, I didn't see any.  OTOH, my eyesight 
is slowly going downhill, now 20/25.  It was 20/10 30 years ago.  Now thats 
reason for profanity...
