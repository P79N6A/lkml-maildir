Priority values 0-99 are real time ones and 100-139 are normal 
scheduling ones. RT scheduling does not change dynamic priority while 
running wheras normal scheduling does (between 100-139). top shows the 
value of the current dynamic priority in the PRI column as the current 
dynamic priority-100. If you have a real time task in top it shows as a 
-ve value. ps -Al seems to show the current dynamic priority+60.
