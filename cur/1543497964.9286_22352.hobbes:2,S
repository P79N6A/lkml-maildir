I've found a decent way to do it and I'll submit a patch this evening.
Startegy:
	a) new method - k_readlink() and new field in struct inode -
i_link.
	b) if i_link is non-NULL readlink() and follow_link() assume that
it contains the name in question and do a generic thing.
	c) if it is NULL and k_readlink() is present we are grabbing
i_sem, check i_link (we might sleep in process) and if it's still NULL 
we call k_readlink(), which must set the i_link. Then we release i_sem and
do a generic thing.
	d) if it is NULL and k_readlink() is NULL too we are falling back
to the current strategy. It's the case only for /proc/self and
/proc/<pid>/* symlinks where we don't get any recursion anyway.
	e) for symlink inodes clear_inode() should include appropriate
releasing of the i_link memory/buffer_head/whatever. We store the relevant
data in fs-specific part of inode.
	It works and I want to test it a bit locally before posting the
thing on l-k/l-fsdevel for public testing.
