Subject: [PATCH] New Console part One.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

After some testings here is the start of the new console system.
The changes here are removal of struct kbd_struct from handler_sysrq. Only
two sysrq functions actually use it. Sysrq should work with any kind of
console system and the major of them will lack a physical keyboard. The
second change is a cleanup and preparation of moving the VT console system
input devices over to the input api.
