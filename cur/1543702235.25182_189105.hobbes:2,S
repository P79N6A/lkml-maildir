It's equivalent to a pool size of zero, yes, so deadlock odds are
significantly higher with some usage scenarios. I'll add a big fat
warning.
On the other hand, the existence of pre-allocated mempools can greatly
increase the likelihood of starvation, oom, and deadlock on the rest
of the system, especially as it becomes a greater percentage of the
total free memory on a small system. In other words, I had to cut this
corner to make running in 2M work with my config. When I merge
CONFIG_BLOCK, it'll be more generally useful.
For the sake of our other readers, I'll point out that mempool doesn't
intrinisically reduce deadlock odds to zero unless we have a hard
limit on requests in flight that's strictly less than pool size.
