HSM is the usual one, and to a large extent probably why Unix originally
had atime. Basically migrating less used files away so as to keep the
system disks tidy.
Its not something usally found on desktop boxes so it doesn't in anyway
argue against the distribution using noatime or relative atime, but on
big server boxes it matters
