I upgraded to modutils 2.1.121. This message is gone. Now I get
request_module[net-pf-1]: fork failed, errno 11
NET4: Unix domain sockets 1.0 for Linux NET4.0.
during the boot. I guess the bug may be in kernel and modutils. The
"unix" module is used by many programs. Everyone tries to load the
same thing at the same time. I will take a look to see if I can
fix it.
