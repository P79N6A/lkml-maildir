Nice idea, because we indeed ran into the problem with 2.6.8.1 that our
own extraversion we always set in the kernel rpms overwrite the .1. So
we are now extracting the EXTRAVERSION from the Makefile to add our
own stuff. All very ugly since the extraversion is contained e.g. in the
path of the kernel source file, and thus, setting an own extraversion
makes all the path stuff difficult.
A LOCALVERSION that was always uninitialized in the kernel.org packages
would be a nice thing, so that EXTRAVERSION could be left untouched.

Frank
