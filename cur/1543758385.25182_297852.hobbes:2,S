Yes, there is a real problem here.  I see if I can figure out the best
way to remedy it...
However I think you reported this problem against a non "-mm" kernel,
and the path from md_check_recovery to generic_make_requests only
exists in "-mm".
Could you please confirm if there is a problem with
    2.6.11-rc4-bk4->bk10
as reported, and whether it seems to be the same problem.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
