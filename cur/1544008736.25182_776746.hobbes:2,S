Hi, Mathieu Desnoyers:
It also required by ASCII text output.
ASCII text output needs get name&fmt from eID, but In current code,
I cannot find a reliable way to get name&fmt from eID. And also,
in the kernel space, we must get name&fmt from eID as fast as possible
by reason of performance. So I cannot use metadata channel for it.
When "Add periodical subbuffer flush for streaming" and "Marker ID management"
will done?
Thanks, Lai.
