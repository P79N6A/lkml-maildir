How about setting the permissions beforehand?

There is no chmod op in struct proto_ops in include/linux/net.h.
Thus, all socket types should behave the same when fchmod() is used on their
FDs.
To summarize in short, you could only fchmod() a socket if you open()ed it
rather than by socket(), but otoh, open() is denied for sockets. What a
deadlock ;-)
I think it's this line in fs/open.c:
        file = fget(fd);
Since you (AFAIK) can't get a "struct file" from a socketfd.
