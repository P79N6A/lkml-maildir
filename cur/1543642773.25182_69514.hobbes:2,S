Unless the error always falls on the same side the accuracy tradeoff is
fatal to the entire scheme of things. Sorting out the use of
get_page_state is worth doing if that is the bottleneck, and
snapshooting such that we only look at it if we might be close to the
limit would work, but we'd need to know when the limit had shifted too
much
