This is what Greg just posted (and Linus merged into BK, so it'll be
in BK snapshots starting tomorrow):

The issue with IN transfers is that microframe scheduling is ... tricky.
One must track all kinds of stuff (which TTs are involved, which microframes
are busy, how busy they are, how much non-TT bandwidth is available).  And
the relevant EHCI data structures are almost as irregular as the USB trees
one must cope with.
Plus one must have the time to spend debugging and fixing the problems, stress
testing the fixes, and devices that will trigger the problems.  I've had none
of those, for quite some time now.  (My particular USB speakers have pretty much
always worked on Linux, even through a USB 2.0 hub.)
Karsten has some not-ready-for-prime-time patches which he's posted
recently.  They basically hardwire some of the scheduling outputs well
enough to get some of his IN transfers to work.  Maybe he'll be nice
enough to repost them against current BK (they include the patch above).
I'd like to see all that split ISO stuff working with EHCI, but someone
else is going to have to do most of the work.  Once it's working we can
take the CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL off, which will remove another source of
errors.  :)
