Who cares?  :)
I don't think there's much point in optimizing here, since these 
functions won't be hot paths anyway.  Yes, they'll be called in 
interrupt handlers and so we don't want them to be _too_ heavy, but 
compared to the overhead of an interrupt handler, a few extra 
instructions in the GPIO access will get lost in the noise.
Inlines generally seem to be more maintainable, give you a symbol that 
you can disassemble and breakpoint, etc.  I'll take them over the macro 
implementations any day, in this case even if there's a cost of a few 
instructions.
All IMHO, of course.
b.g.
