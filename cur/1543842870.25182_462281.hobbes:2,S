Yes
Basically in low_latency the following is valid
	driver receives bytes
		flush_to_ldisc
			ldisc calls driver write methods
That means if you have a shared lock for read/write you want to drop it
after you've bashed the hardware and before you flush_to_ldisc. Remember
the IRQ handler is not re-entrant so another IRQ of the same number
won't cause further I/O and out of order receives.
