we have a cross toolchain working; most of the fileutils, textutils,
shellutils packages, fdisk, e2fsprogs, mount, and probably a few other
random programs.  yesterday, we found out why native gcc was crashing
the kernel; today we're trying to figure out why it still doesn't work
now that this bug is kludged around.
you need to be confident at compiling things and be able to track down
what's gone wrong when things don't compile in order to be useful at
this time.
i'm fiddling with the website right now and i'll see what i can do in
the way of clarity.  constructive criticism welcomed.
