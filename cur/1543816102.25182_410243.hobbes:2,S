This particular patch actually decreases the amount of memory used by swsusp.
Moreover I have _nothing_ against improvements, but it requires some time to
improve things.

Well, you know, it's generally easy to say that something's done in a wrong
way, but this alone doesn't help _anyone_.
Suggestions are nice, but _someone_ has to implement them and I think
Nigel is more than capable of doing it in this particular case.  Also the code
in question is quite sensitive and such that it should be tested for a longer
time IMO.
That's what I was trying to say and it was not my intention to be nasty at all.
Greetings,
Rafael
