The problem with doing it in the VFS is that we might end up calling
flush twice; it may very well be that for some filesystems, we'll be
calling the flush operation as part of writing out the commit block,
for example.
I'm not sure it's fair to say that we need to "randomly sprinkle
blkdev_issue_flush() calls all over the place".  The number of places
where we need to do O_SYNC or fsync() handling is in fact quite small.
We were simply ignoring this problem before.

What, just to avoid needing the "..->i_sb->s_bdev" construction?  I
personally find extra levels of inline functions to be harder to deal
with long term, since I then I have to track down the definition of
ext3_blkdev_issue_flush in the header files to make sure there isn't
any other magic hiding in there other than the i->i_sb->s_bdev
derefencing.
