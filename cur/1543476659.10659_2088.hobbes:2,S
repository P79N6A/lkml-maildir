The normal way to allow a module to have an influence on the resident
kernel is to have a set of "register_something()" and "unregister_something()"
functions that the module code can call.
This is the safe way to do it, since the module unloading mechanism will
ensure that there are no strange pointers left around after the module
is removed. (At least if the module developer has done the Right Thing (TM)).
