Looks to me as if the code added to pci_bus_add_devices() is off it's
rocker.
In brief, pci_bus_add_devices() is supposed to be callable given *any*
state of the bus, and it will add any new devices found in the bus tree
from the bus that it's called for downwards.  (That's how I designed
that bit of PCI code - so it can cope with hotpluggable PCI bridges.)
It still does this.  However, some bright spark decided to add sysfs
links to it - and break it.  Now, whenever we descend into a subordinate
bus (and return to a higher level) we will try to create a sysfs symlink
even if the bus is one that we already registered.
So... that sysfs_create_link() call in there should not be unconditional.
It should _only_ ever do that call if list_empty(&dev->subordinate->node)
was true.  IOW, we only create symlinks for subordinate bus that we don't
already know about.
It looks like it was introduced by Greg's "PCI: fix __must_check warnings"
but why a patch advertised _solely_ as a fix is adding additional sysfs
attributes I've no idea.
Something like the following should fix it.  Bahadir - please test.
