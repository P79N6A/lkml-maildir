Valdis,
inode->i_security is no longer used after the patch.  Does your question
still apply with the proposed patch, %s/inode->i_security/file->f_security/?
Nevertheless, note that the thing being enforced is "no simultaneous
write access to a block device and mount of that block device."  The
file->f_security is just used as a flag to seclvl that when this file
is closed, we can bd_release the device to allow a mount or another
open(O_RDWR) of the file.  So references to the inode don't matter,
provided the other references are read accesses.  Which they have to
be, since otherwise the seclvl_bd_claim() would have failed on the
second open(O_RDWR) call.
I hope I'm at least remotely answering your question :)
