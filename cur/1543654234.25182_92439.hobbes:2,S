try_module_get() will succeed now during initialization, because the
module starts live.

del_timer_sync is actually an oddity: most deregistration functions do
not block pending outstanding calls, they reference count and "unhook"
at deregistration, and delete when the refcount hits zero (if they do
anything at all 8).
(Note also: timers don't need to do try_module_get() since they can't
sleep).

Yes, but that's not the way things work currently: the interfaces to
reserve and publish are not separated.  And whether it's worth
separating them simply because of this, is the question.

Yes, and it's already in the list of exceptions: you're being called
by the module itself here.
Also, you're assuming that the coder chose not to do the
try_module_get() at request submission time.
Finally, there are some cases where a module can miss events while
unloading, but that's OK, because it's *guaranteed* to exit at this
point, so it must clean everything up in its cleanup routine anyway.
I couldn't think of an exception, can you?

Only by splitting cleanup into "cleanup" and "destroy" (either by
having cleanup say "OK, I'm not live anymore" halfway though, or
having separate hooks).
We have over 1500 modules: not changing the interfaces to them was one
of the key goals.  If someone decides to later, fine.

Heh...  <sigh> Point taken.  I already decided to leave this one for
the moment, and do something more productive.
Thanks,
Rusty.
