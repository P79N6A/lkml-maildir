To enable stack unwinding for exception handling, extra exception-related 
information about each function needs to be available for each stack frame. 
This information describes which destructors need to be called (so that local 
objects can be cleaned up), indicates whether the current function has a try 
block, and lists which exceptions the associated catch clauses can handle.
Take a look at a typical OOPS trace and tell me if that will fit in a 4k stack 
with C++ and stack unwinding.

    Choose the right tools, use them the right way. 
     Refuse to compromise, expect  to succeed, 
                      Then start again.
