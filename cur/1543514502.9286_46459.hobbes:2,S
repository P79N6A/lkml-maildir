Hi!
On notebooks it is quite common to be able to change cpu clock. What
happens when bogomips go wrong by factor of two?
I can see it pretty well possible on my toshiba: If I boot with
low-battery situation, I get 150MHz cpu; if I then turn onto AC power,
I guess I get 300MHz cpu. Bogomips will be very wrong...
I'm seeing very strange things on this toshiba. Maybe toshiba people
did something very wrong with cooling (their fan starts "on demand"),
or maybe something else is wrong. I see single-bit corruption.
Hunting ghosts,
