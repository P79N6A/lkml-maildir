 I did look for open/close first and finally added the 'loading' because
 I didn't have them.
 I don't thing it is so ugly, but if I could see open/close and the
 consensus is that 'loading' should go, I'll do it.

 The script will not automatically run at least until the timeout is
 expired.
 But in case you are doing things by hand, how about:
	$ echo cancel > .../loading
	or if you want to keep the content numeric:
	$ echo -1 > .../loading
 This will also allow the regular script to just cancel the load in case
 of error, like if the firmware image is not available or a read error
 happened while reading it.
 I'll implement that and the other stuff that came out of Oliver's
 comments later today and post the new code.

 If 'loading' stays the above should fix your timeout issue, and if it
 goes, yes, that is probably the way to go.
 Thanks
