Nope. Any kernel can't. The thing is the system overcommits 
memory (it allows applications to allocate more memory than the system 
is able to handle).
If there is no place to "save" that memory once you run out of it,
you're dead. Its a physical problem. :)

You can try to remove the following lines from mm/vmscan.c::try_to_free_pages_zone() 
        if (likely(current->pid != 1))
                break;
        if (!check_classzone_need_balance(classzone))
                break;
And disable CONFIG_OOM_KILLER. See if that makes a difference.
What will happen is that the kernel will try to free memory and 
never go into the OOM killer. If it can't free memory, the
system will hang forever at certain point.
There's not much to do about it really.
In 2.6 you can decrease swappiness so for it to free pagecache harder, 
but its the same game.
