The i2c layer has changed, you have to have i2c bit-banging devices and
i2c device interface compiled as well, at least that is what works for me.
If you have them compiled into the kernel as well, try with them as a
module.
Also if you have video4linux compiled in the kernel, you probably have to
have i2c compiled in as well.
hope this helps
