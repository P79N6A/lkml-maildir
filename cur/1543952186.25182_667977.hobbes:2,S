RAID controllers do not have half a terabyte of RAM. Also, you are always
invited to choose between speed (write back) and reliability (write through).
Also, please note that the problem here is not related to the number of
nines of availability. This number only counts the ratio between uptime
and downtime. We're more facing a problem of MTBF, where the consequences
of a failure are hard to predict.
What I'm thinking about is that considering the fact that storage
technologies are moving towards SSD (and I think 2008 will be the
year of SSD), you should implement ordered writes (I've not said
write through) since there's no seek time on those devices. Thus
you will have the speed of RAM with the reliability of a properly
synced FS. If your system crashes once a week, it will not be a
problem anymore.
