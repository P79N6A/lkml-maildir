How many clock cycles does it take to dispatch an I/O out cycle to PCI
bus on UDI and on standard linux. I'll give you a clue - linux is a single
inlined asm instruction

As the microkernel unix people used to say before they finally died out
"We are within X% of the performance of the original". 
My I2O driver can turn a disk block request into an I2O message, post it
and handle the reply in about 400 cycles. Do that with UDI.
