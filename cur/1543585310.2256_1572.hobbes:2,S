I couldn't find a maintainer of the code, so I'm writing here.
In kernel 2.4.1 in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c there is:
--- arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
struct resource standard_io_resources[] = {
        { "dma1", 0x00, 0x1f, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "pic1", 0x20, 0x3f, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "timer", 0x40, 0x5f, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "keyboard", 0x60, 0x6f, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "dma page reg", 0x80, 0x8f, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "pic2", 0xa0, 0xbf, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "dma2", 0xc0, 0xdf, IORESOURCE_BUSY },
        { "fpu", 0xf0, 0xff, IORESOURCE_BUSY }
};

which fix-allocate some io-resources.
What is the reason for that?
Isn't that a job of the device drivers?
In KGI we have our own keyboard driver which tries to allocate the 
kayboard I/O range for itself, and when it does io_check_region() it 
fails. What should I do?
