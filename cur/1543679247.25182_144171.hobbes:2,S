Yes, and I think it is the right way to follow. If we ensure, that each 
of described steps preserves filesystem integrity we could automate this 
thus getting what was described in initial idea but simpler. Yet better 
- there is code that solves nearly all problems, there is only need to 
automate fiddling with partitions and LVM, so end user will see this as 
real transparent :-)
