Sounds good.
Hmm, I tend to avoid creating new file in the Linux tree... :-p

Thank you for your information.
I hadn't notice the Linus's post... iomap.h is very interesting.
In fact, I'm targeting current distro's. However now I think it is
worth to reconsider my plan if we are entering a great transitional
stage in the development of the kernel infrastructure...

This part is ia64 specific staff... we need something like "add" to
make sure the value is not poisoned.  Since the processor asserts an
MCA at the time when the poisoned value is "consumed" - more properly,
the MCA is signaled at or before the use of the IO read transaction:
LabelA:  ld8  r15 = [r16] // Load
LabelB:  Mov  r17 = r18;;
  :
LabelX:  Mov  r22 = r15   // MCA signaled at or before this instruction
So the "add" make us sure that read_pci_errors() which should follow
this readX_check() never fail to catch all MCA that could be caused by
values fetched by some readX_check().
AFAIK, this "add" works as something like barrier(), definitely certain,
and quick than PAL_MC_DRAIN call.

No no, it's my overlooking... They are duplicated.
Add it only linux/pci.h.
