I think I'm going to give up soon (much to relief of the list) because I
keep getting the same sorts of answers which make sense from a small
custom shop point of view but are simply broken from a company point of
view.
Your model is fine, there is nothing wrong with it but there isn't a lot
right with it either.  You can't really grow your business under that 
model.  Why?  Because you are essentially a consulting shop and that 
isn't going to generate the revenue you need to hire more people, build
more things, get more consulting.  You can keep yourself going but not
make enough to get more people going.
Instead of coming back at me with the premise of "well, I'm eating so my
model is OK" how about coming back with a plan that says "Here's how we
make an open source based business put Microsoft out of business".  That's
reality.  You are just playing around on the edges, there is nothing 
wrong with that, but until you have a viable plan that competes with the
big boys let's stop kidding ourselves, ok?
