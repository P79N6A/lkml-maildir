Well...
OSS->swsusp
ALSA->Suspend2
Merge them both, and see which wins.
Anyway... Unlike the ALSA case, people opens bugs on suspen2 (The new
system) and not on swsusp, since Nigel is much more receptive, and
because of the large user community suspend2 works much better.
Pavel and Refael beg people to open bugs agains swsusp/uswsusp... But
people prefers to solve issues of the out-of-kernel solution...  The
process is as follows:
Try swsusp->It does not work/Not suited->Try suspend2->Works/does
not->Get support from suspend2->Suspend2 works->Suspend2 better->User
happy.
