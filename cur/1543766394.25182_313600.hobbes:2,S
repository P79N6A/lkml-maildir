"gcapatch" should be trivial if I have understood it correctly, and git
can already do it. I've never used it, though, and in a mixed git/bk
environment you probably want to use bk to do these things and just import
things from git, if only because bk will be better at merging things
automatically.
Also, exporting from git->bk looks like it should be very easy and 
automatable efficiently. "SMOP".
