Of course the userspace can request encrypting any amount of data (well,
multiple of blocksize), but only at most one page at a time is copied
into the kernel, encrypted and returned back to the process' memory.
IMHO It is faster than allocating e.g. 4 MB in the kernel, copying all
of this from userspace, encrypting and returning back. That wouldn't use
the CPU cache too efficiently.

As I'm currently working only on one kernel page at a time I think
FILL_SG() is sufficient. But I'm definitely interested how to use
multiple sg's at once (although I don't immediately ned it). Where can I
see these functions? Maybe thay could go to some library directly in
linux/crypto/...?
