It's fine if gas fixes things. It's not fine if gas breaks things that 
used to work, for no really good reason.

Ok, that's a real x86-64 bug, it seems. Andi, please fix, preferably by 
just making the "g" be a "r".
However, your argument isn't very valid, since:
> The new assembler will make sure that it won't happen.
Not true, since the suggestion was just to change all segment "movl"  
things to "mov", at which point the same old bug is still there, and the
assembler didn't really help us at all.
See the problem? You're not actually protecting anything. The change just 
makes it _harder_ to make sizes explicit, and suddenly we have to trust an 
assembler to be clever about sizes, when that assembler historically has 
definitely _not_ been very clever about them at all.
