Yes it is.  Also, the PCI clock is frequency modulated to reduce
electrical interference.  (Or on a more cynical note, to pass the
official emissions tests ;-)
However it's common practice to PLL to the PCI clock, for clock
distribution on a board, so varying the frequency must be done in a
strictly constrained fashion.
