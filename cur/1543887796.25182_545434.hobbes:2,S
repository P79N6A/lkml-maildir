I hope the network stack already uses the appropriate allocator flags.
If the slab was GFP_DMA that doesn't change, the ->reserve_slab will
still be GFP_DMA.

No, no, for each regular allocation we retry to populate ->cpu_slab with
a new slab. If that works we're out of the woods and the ->reserve_slab
is cleaned up.
