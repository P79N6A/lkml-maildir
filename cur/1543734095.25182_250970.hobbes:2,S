Thanks a lot for doing this.
I don't know your architecture and asm so cannot properly comment on it.
There does seem to be a lot of code duplication in there.  I can imagine
it may be optimal to have a separate atomic_inc and atomic_dec, the
most common operations.  But do you really need atomic_add, atomic_sub,
atomic_add_return, atomic_sub_return, atomic_inc_return, atomic_dec_return
all with their own code blocks?  Maybe, but looks excessive to an outsider.
Perhaps "and return it" rather than just "and return"
in those function comments?
