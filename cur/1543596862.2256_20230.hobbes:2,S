One can but try.
Linus included the test for non-null page->mapping
as well.  I wonder why.
Also, the change means that the TLB flush is not performed
for invalid or reserved pages.  Is this correct?  (Why is there
a TLB flush there in the first place?)
There's a flush_tlb_range() down in filemap_sync() as well, so
we appear to end up flushing the affected TLBs twice?
