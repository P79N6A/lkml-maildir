Subject: [REPORT] 2.6.21 vs. 2.6.21-sd046 vs. 2.6.21-CFSv7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/30/446

System: Intel 6600 Core2duo, 2GB RAM, X nice 0 for all tests, display 
using i945G framebuffer
Test: playing a 'toon with mplayer while kernel build -j20 running.
Tuning: not yet, all scheduler parameters were default
Result: base 2.6.21 showed some pauses and after the pause the sound got 
louder for a short time (<500ms). With sd-0.46 the playback had many 
glitches and finally just stopped with the display looping on a small 
number of frames and no sound. The skips were repeatable, the hang was 
only two of five runs, I didn't let them go until the make finished 
(todo list) but killed the mplayer after 10-15 sec. No glitches observed 
with cfsv7, I thought I saw one but repeating with granularity set to 
500000 and then with no make running convinced me that it's just a 
crappy piece of animation at that point.
I ran glxgears, again sd-0.46 had frequent pauses and uneven fps 
reported. Stock 2.6.21 had a visible pause when the frame rate was 
output, otherwise minimal pauses. CFSv7 appeared smooth at about 250 fps.
All tests gave acceptable typing echo, it seems that X is getting enough 
time at that load to echo without major issues.
I will be doing tests with server load later this week, have to add disk 
for the database.
Hope this initial report is useful, I may be able to update ctxbench 
later today and try that.
