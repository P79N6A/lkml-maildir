Just a question about kbuild behaviour:
I compiled 2.5.24, with make dep, make bzImage, make modules....
After that, as usually, make dep; make bzImage ...doesn't change nor
recompile anything After that, I changed an option with menuconfig,
"VGA 16-color graphics console support",and "3DFX Banshee/Voodoo 3
display support" (because i can't see somethnig when i boot with it)
from built-in to module. Then I run make dep; and it did make some small
changes, as expected.
Then make bzImage compiled the entier kernel again, or at less a big big
part of it, not only the changes made in menuconfig. make modules
recompiled things again, wich are not affected with the changes (ie:
iptables modules).
My questions is:
It's not expected to do the same as 2.4 kernels, i mean, recompile only
the changes made, not the entire thing?
PD: What are you doing with kbuild 2.5? What parts are you integrating?
Wich parts you aren't going to integrate?
