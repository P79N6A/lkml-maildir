    If I'm a non-root user, I get "permission denied", even for ldd.
    If I'm root, all is peachy.
    Veeeeery annoying.
    I dual-boot this machine (or did, before I blew away the disk and
    put a new copy of Mastodon on it) with 2.0.28, and netscape works
    there.  gl*bc'ed binaries continue to be happy, so Civilization
    works;  on my development machines, Netscape is the only libc5'ed
    binary in the shop, and that doesn't work.  If I recall correctly,
    Netscape still worked with 2.3.15.
    Currently I'm writing it off as a local configuration thing;  The
    list of patches I've been hawking to every kernel hacker that
    doesn't run fast enough to get away are the more critical things.
    If it's still broken with 2.3.20, then I'll begin to fret.
