3 and 4 are subjective, and for 2, the performance penalty has to come
some place. The upside, as explained, is that drivers aren't penalized
for setting the block size and then failing to use it. Something that
gives us the flexibility to write cleaner code.
As for benefits, there are other issues. We might want to deal with
things like alignment problems in the future.

Agreed, we're doing a bit more guessing than one would like. But I
don't agree in keeping the core simple and flexible. Rather the
opposite. Any guarantee that we give drivers now and need to remove in
the future needs to be tested with all drivers that rely on it (a
difficult task as it often takes some effort to find people with
hardware and the ability to test patches).
As such, the guarantees should be kept at a minimum. Code is easily
changed, API is not.
IMO, the best way to achieve this is with an API that describes _what_
the drivers want to do, not _how_. Hence my insistence on allowing
drivers to specify the difference between "I want this data
transferred" and "I want this data transferred with an exact block size
of 32 bytes".

These looks good. The only part I'm really attached to is the blksz ==
0 case, which you have.
