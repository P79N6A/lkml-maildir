I can try these patches in the next days, can you point me to an url?

I just tried 2.6.6-rc1-mm1 (patched with mppe and iscsi), same problem.
I compiled with CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER and CONFIG_USB_DEBUG, after booting,
I activate the usb-dongle (Fn+F5 on the IBM T41p), then I run `hciconfig
down' and `rmmod hci_usb', which triggers the problem
I uploaded both the config and the whole syslog file from the boot until
shutting down:

I'm using udev 0.024-2 from debian, and it is working quite well :-)
