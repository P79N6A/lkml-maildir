Well, no, that's one of the benefits of physical readahead: it is far less 
sensitive to disk layout than file-base readahead.

You mean, well clustered, which it is.  These trees were created by an untar 
onto an otherwise relatively young filetree.  I could repeat the experiment 
on a partition with nothing but this source on it.  I would expect similar 
results.

Doesn't this just support what I'm saying?  Anyway, the dd trick won't work 
because the page cache has no way of using the contents of the buffer cache.  
It has to re-read it even though it's already in memory - this is ugly, don't 
you agree?  When we make dd use the page cache as with Andrea's patch it 
still won't work because the page cache will still ignore blocks that already 
exist in the buffer cache mapping.
Because we're still using the buffer cache for metadata there will be some 
improvement with the dd trick, but not enormous.  I can't take the time to 
test it right now, but I will.
If we implement the physical block reverse mapping as I described in an 
earlier post then the dd technique will work fine.

Well, you can see from my demonstration that logical readahead sucks 
badly for this common case.  I did mention that the two can coexist, didn't 
I?  In fact they already do on any system with a caching disk controller.  
Just not enough to handle two kernel trees.

I'd have a good think about that 'surely'.
