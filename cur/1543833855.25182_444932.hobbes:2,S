Other suggestions:
- try it on 2.6.16.X which is supposed to be longer-lived, and forward
  port as that system is discontinued.
- see if you can implement your concepts in user space (FUSE). If there
  are sufficient advantages, port it to the kernel.

Linux developers have often uttered their unwillingness for stable
interfaces.

If the file system is so crucial for the intended application, would not
its choice alone dominate over all other criteria and demote the weight
of the OS rather "convenience" or "it's just a name"?
