Hmm, pci_enable_device_bars() approach looks better and better to me.
If we use this approach, we need to consider which (a) and (b) we
should use, as you said.
The (b) option looks natural to me because pci_enable_device_bars() and
pci_request_regions_bars() becomes a pair. But the (b) option would have
a problem at resume time. If the driver doesn't have .resume() method,
default resume routine (i.e. pci_default_resume()) will be called, and
it calls pci_enable_device().
The (a) option doesn't have this kind of problem. But it looks a little
strange to me that we use pci_enable_device_bars() at probe time while
we use pci_enable_device() at resume time, though I might be too anxious.
To tell the truth, I've considered this before. I could not come up with
which is better between (a) and (b), and then I posted another approach
which introduce a new API. Now I came back to this approach again. Maybe
I'm being caught by the endless loop...
I would very much appreciate giving me any comments about (a) and (b).
Thanks,
