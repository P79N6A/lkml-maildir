That is even more interesting. So the bug affects forcedeth, but not
nvnet. Hmmm. We'll have to review the code again.

Foner: Do you see similarities between your problem and this one?
Janusz, Foner: Are you willing to test forcedeth with a few dozen

I would send you patches to binary search the offending code.
