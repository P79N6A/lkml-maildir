Subject: [PATCH: NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5.7] support for NCR voyager (3/4/5xxx  series)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This really only tidies up the split out of arch/i386 in the previous release. 
 It also backs out a fix for the migration_mask physical/logical CPU problems 
in 2.5.6 in favour of the official fix.
In response to will it work questions, this is the list of supported types
3430/3360 (Level 4): Works (tested up to 2 way), need sim710 driver for 
internal SCSI chip.
345x (Level 5): Works (tested up to 10 way), need NCR_D700 or BusLogic SCSI 
card.
35xx (Level 5): Should work up to 16 way (not tested), need NCR_D700 or 
BusLogic SCSI card.
4100 (Level 5): Should work (not tested), need NCR_D700 SCSI card.  Q720 
driver is broken currently, so must use D700 or BusLogic SCSI card.
51xx (Level 5): Should work up to 32 way (not tested).  No Q720 driver is a 
bit of a problem here since I don't think they support anything else.
The patch is in two parts this time:  The i386 sub-architecture split is 
separated from the addition of the voyager components

(The split diff is pretty huge because it's actually moving files about).  You 
must apply the split diff before applying the voyager one.
