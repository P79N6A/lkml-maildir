Does anyone know where I can possible get a kernel debugger for RedHad 6.0
for my driver development? Or any good way to debug it with most kernel
debugger functionality (such as single step trace, stack trace, break point
set, memory dispaly, etc)?
Also could anyone point out where the following message comes from during
the driver installation "insmod" and what is the meaning of that?
  "Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0001c000"
Thanks!
