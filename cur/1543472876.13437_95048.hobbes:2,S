Hi
We have a realy serious problem with the file wtmp created by sac.
We use Linux Slackware 3.5 & sac program to account ppp ussers. In this
mounth we got some power down (a romanian old problem) & our USP is death.
After rebooting the OP we got some file corupt problem. One of them was wtmp
too.
Now If i run sac -w wtmp he gives me an err. like the wtmp file is corupted.
I dono what to do, because is end of the mounth & we have 2 make the user
accounts. We tried 2 find wtmpfix or fixwtmp but is for SUN only.
Please Help us or give some advice about our problem.
Thank You!
