Actually, jewish houses have two kitchen sinks - extremely useful (for

The very good thing about devfs is a rationalized namespace - things are
where they should be. I agree that in principle, it does not matter
whether we have a /proc/cpuinfo or /dev/cpu/info if both files behave
identically, but groupping logically related things together is a good
idea, instead of just putting a lot of stuff in the root of /proc and some
things group into subdirectories thereof.
After reading devfs/README and the code I am starting to be on Richard's
side that "tough, use devfs" is not such a bad idea, after all :)
