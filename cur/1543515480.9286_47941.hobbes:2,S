Yeah, I noticed that - a quick grep shows that there's a variety of
definitions in several header files, ranging from 126 for XENIX_LINK_MAX
and SYSV_LINK_MAX to 32000 for EXT2_LINK_MAX/UFS_LINK_MAX and 65530 for
MINIX2_LINK_MAX. The thing that gets me is that if LINK_MAX in limits.h
is supposed to be a minimum value, then why do we have 126 for Xenix and
SysV? Why not just set LINK_MAX to 32000 to match ext2 and be done with
it?
