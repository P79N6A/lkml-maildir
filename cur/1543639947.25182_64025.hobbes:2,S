If you're logging huge messages, sure, that's just plain Stupid.  But for 
messages that are smaller than the size of the stdio buffer an fprintf() 
followed by fflush() gets a single atomic write for most values of libc.

And that's why we have write(2) on file descriptors.  Having write(2) 
in the form of syslog(2) makes no sense.  It adds to the mass of abi 
that needs to be maintained.  Making the mechanism of writing using the 
existing infrastructure doesn't increase the size of the ABI.
