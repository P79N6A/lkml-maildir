Well, just two examples (both for PCI IO limited to 16 bits for simplicity,
but still from real life):
1. Consider some BAR that defines 16 bytes of IO space. It's
   perfectly valid for the PCI firmware to program this BAR to
   its max value, so after writing all 1s during the probe and proper
   masking we have base == maxbase == 0xfff0. But, since all high
   order bits are all 1s, (((base | size) & mask) != mask) is false,
   and we return correct value of 16.
2. Another BAR of some broken PCI device (typically, IDE controller)
   has *read-only* value of 0x1f0, for instance. After writing 0xffff
   we still read back the same 0x1f0, so base == maxbase == 0x1f0.
   But the second part of that "if" clause is now true, so we return 0,
   which means that the BAR is invalid and must be ignored.
Ivan.
