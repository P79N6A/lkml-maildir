OK, I've applied this kernel-symbols patch and the corrected kernel-rules

OK.  It is highly unlikely that the lexer could get it that badly wrong;
the code is brute-force simple

I see that.  This is a rulebase-design problem.  As the new section on 
rulebase design in the manual observes:
<sect1><title>Good style in rulebase design</title>
<para>The configuration experience defined by a CML2 rulebase can vary greatly 
in its degree of apparent complexity to a human user, depending on how
much context and interdependency information the user has to keep in mind
to get through the process.  In general, you want to minimize this cognitive
load. </para> 
<para>Good choices of menu organization and rules can help accomplish this.
In particular, human beings will find easiest a sequential set of
questions in which few questions depend on questions previously asked,
and <emphasis>no</emphasis> questions depend on questions that are
asked after them.</para>
<para>Most CML2 declarations can be written in any order, and CML2 constraints
can reach either forwards or backwards in that order.  But the full power
of this generality unleashed creates rulesets that are hard for humans 
to reason about.  So it's good style to use that power in a more controlled
way.</para>
<para>To do this, it's important to think about three different
ordering relationships.  The first is the order of declarations in the
rulebase.  The second is the "natural" order of questions in the menu
tree -- a depth-first or preorder traversal defined by the ordering
and inclusion relationships in the menus.  And the third is the order
in which human users driving the configurator will normally answer the
questions.</para>
<para>To make life as simple as possible for developers and users, these
three orders should largely coincide (though the order of declarations
in the rulebase is only important for readability by developers, 
and need not be as tightly coupled
to the other two orderingss as they should be to each other).</para>
<para>To remind you of this, the compiler warns about uses of question
symbols in a visibility-guard or dependency expression for a symbol
occuring <emphasis>before</emphasis> the associated question in
preorder.  This is what the compiler warning "FOO depends on ['BAR']
forward" means.</para>
<para>There are other heuristics you can follow to keep life simple.
Holding explicit dependencies, requirements, and visibility
expressions (as opposed to implicit ones defined by the menu
structure) to a minimum is an important one; these, typically,
represent links across the tree rather than locally from parent to
child nodes, and complicate things.</para>
<para>Also, put global questions that will greatly constrain other choices 
early in the preorder, even if this sometimes means separating them
from submenus that perhaps would naturally go beneath them.</para>
<para>In the Linux kernel configuration rulebase, for example, there
is a `buses' menu that contains enabling symbols for major subsystems
like IDE, SCSI, and PCMCIA.  The menus for IDE, SCSI, and PCMCIA are
not beneath this menu as might seem natural but rather later on in the
preorder.  The reason for this is that some devices have
cross-dependencies on more than one bus or controller type (there are
PCMCIA SCSI cards, for example.)  To avoid forward dependencies, it's
best to group all of these bus/controller symbols before the hardware
driver menus they control.</para>
</sect1>
Once this machinery is in place, the tree is un for some serious 
reordering.

OK, I got it.  Will respond shortly.
