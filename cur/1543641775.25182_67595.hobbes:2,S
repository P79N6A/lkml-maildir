As I got quite some unmotivated sigs in the last time, I also made some
Hardware tests.
According to memtest my ram seems to be Ok. Unfortnately after heavy use 
even building the kernel crashes while it succeeds directly after booting.
So I fear that there is Problem with the cooling of my cpu.
Maybe those kernel oopses could be due to that problem too.
I apologize bothering you maybe for nothing.
