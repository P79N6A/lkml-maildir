Yes, changes are required. I fixed up padlock-aes.c along the way. So
don't worry if it's just padlock. 
The changes to the CryptoAPI core minimal, in fact, 10 lines, retaining
all the functionally of you original patch. I'll finalize/clean/post the
patch when the scatterwalk stuff is merged. Please have a look at the
scatterwalk code, because, as I don't have a padlock, you'll have the
joy of running my code for the very first time :)
