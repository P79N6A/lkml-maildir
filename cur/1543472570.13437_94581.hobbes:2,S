Sorry if this seems a bit vague, but I'm debugging it over the
telephone with a customer who is 1,000 miles away.
Red Hat 5.1. With an IBM token ring card, things work fine under 2.1.131
but there are other issues there (we have already managed to crash once).
2.1.131 is compiled as SMP.  This is a dual-processor PII-450 with 1gb of
RAM, Asus P2B-D motherboard, 72gb RAID partition on an ICP-Vortex GDT RAID
controller. He is using mars_nwe to share the RAID partition on to the
token ring LAN (meaning it's talking IPX, not IP, when it crashes), and
copying a large optical jukebox of data onto the Linux server via mars_nwe
when the kernel gives an "Oops" and crashes. Sorry, I don't have the
"Oops" message, he did not note it before rebooting the machine and
besides that's not the real deal.
The real deal is that I'd like to go back to the 2.0.36 kernel.
Unfortunately, ifconfig locks up when we do that. The card is detected
when the module is loaded, with its proper I/O address and interrupt (it
is using IRQ 9 and the default I/O address), just as it is under the 2.1
series kernel, but ifconfig locks up.
The statement I'm using to bring up the interface is:
  ifconfig tr0 146.143.173.15 netmask 255.255.255.128 broadcast
146.143.173.127
Works fine with 2.1.131, flunks with default Red Hat 2.0.35-1 kernel and
with straight 2.0.36 kernel as well as with an SMP 2.0.36 kernel. Doing an
strace on it. The strace stops at:
  ioctl(3,SIOCSIFADDR,0xbffffc7c)=0
  ioctl(3,SIOCGIFFLAGS,0xbffffc34)=0
  ioctl(3,SIOCSIFFLAGS
(it quits at the "S"). 
Is there a token ring mailing list or web page somewhere, or maybe an
updated driver? Will the 2.1 driver compile under 2.0? Any ideas?
