Okay, but you can simply do autosuspend with remote wakeup completely
inside input driver. You do ot need it to be controlled from X... at
most you need one variable ('autosuspend_inactivity_timeout')
controlled from userland.
That's what we already do for hdd spindown... you simply tell disk to
aitospindown after X seconds of inactivity.
