Actually, it's the order in which the probe functions run, which is
typically related to the order in which they are loaded. You can
blacklist one driver and get the other instead.

Nah. Random build ordering as it always has been - two different builds
would end up with modules in a different order on disk, hence depmod
would generate a different ordering. This will be fixed shortly with the
Modules.order bits, but you will still need to blacklist one of the
drivers (unless you're lucky and 8139too comes first), until there is
proper support for dynamic rebinding and udev rules to do that.

Nah. It's a "bug" insomuch as we don't handle multiple matching aliases
very well, and it's becoming more common, so we probably should :)
