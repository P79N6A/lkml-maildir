The label in lilo, not the "name". That can also have changed. Probably
has if the kernel is old enough that you've forgotten which it is anyway.
And what if it booted via nfs, or off a floppy?
Why all this palaver? It doesn't matter if you can figure out the image.
I could probably do it by diffing symbols. The point is that it's not
easy and it is silly. Just put the config options in /proc where we can all
see them. I couldn't care less about 4k ram from a 256MB server. I couldn't
even care in an 8MB machine (and I _have_ an 8MB machine).
