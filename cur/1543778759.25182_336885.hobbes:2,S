Hello,
I want ,for tracing and debugging purposes, to be able to generate a single 
interrupt on a device which (unlike the timer or ide devices, for example) does 
not get interrupts very frequently.
Looking at the output of /proc/interrupts (and look at IRQ 6 of the
floppy) shows
that the floppy device interrupt counter is not incremented during time if you
are not constatntly working with it.
So a good candidate for generating a single interrupt can be a floppy.
Is there a way to generate a single interrupt on a floppy device?
I had tried the following:
I mount the floppy;
I see that during the time, sometimes after running ls on a floppy
2 interrupts are generated; and sometimes after ls on a floppy
no interrupts are generated. The same is with
creating a file/reading a file: sometimes there
are interrupts and sometimes there are no interrupts.
So I wrote the following little program:
#define BUFFER_SIZE 2048
char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE] __attribute__((aligned(4096)));
int main()
        {
        int fd;
        int bytes_read;
        int i;
        fd = open("/dev/fd0",O_DIRECT);
        void* data;
        if (fd < 0 )
          printf("could not open device\n");
       else
        printf("device opened\n");
                {
                bytes_read = read(fd,buffer,512);
                //fseek(fd,SEEK_CUR,1);
                printf("bytes_read = %d\n",bytes_read);
                }
        close(fd);
        }
Each time I ran it I got course :
device opened
bytes_read = 512
But running this program again and again ***DOES NOT*** increase the
number of interrupt on the floppy device IRQ (6).
Any ideas?
Which user space code I should write / Which operation should I do so that each
time I will do it,(again and again) it will generate an interrupt on the 
floppy IRQ (6) ?
(BTW I build this program by  gcc -D_GNU_SOURCE floppy.c)
Regards,
John
