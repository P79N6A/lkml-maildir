Hi,
I misconfigured my Linux 2.2.18 kernel: forgot to include the network
device, which is kind of essential for a machine with nfs-root.....
So it just sat there waiting for the root floppy... Then I recompiled
my kernel, but when I came back to the console I saw:
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
scsi : 0 hosts.
scsi : detected total.
IP-Config: No network devices available
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up.
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, trying floppy.
(Warning, this kernel has no ramdisk support)
VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER
end_request: I/O error, dev 02:00 (floppy), sector 0
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000008
current->tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
If someone has some desire to fix something, you can try to find/fix
this. 
The recompile of course overwrote the symbol table from the kernel
that I was running...
					Roger.
