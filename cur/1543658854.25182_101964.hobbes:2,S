The reason was just least line of resistance.  The code doesn't use the block 
descriptors, so there's no need to ask for them.  The code is written to skip 
over the block descriptors, just in case the device returns them, so setting 
DBD to zero should have no practical effect.

I agree with replacing the functionality with this call.  On general 
principle, the DBD bit (and any other missing pieces) should be added to 
mode_sense6 just to make it as useful as possible (and, I suppose, the call 
should be moved into scsi_lib since more than just sd could make use of it).

Well, the cache is pretty often part of the permanent assembly, not part of 
the removable medium, so I think it should still be called for removable 
media. That begs the question, of course, what should the cache type be---it 
strikes me as rather unsafe to have a removable RW medium with a write back 
cache?  I suppose at the very least we should to a SYNCHRONIZE on ejection if 
it's write back?
