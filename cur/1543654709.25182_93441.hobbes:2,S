OK. Using v3 tools with the v4 kernel modules isn't well tested.  It is
supposed to work, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were problems. 
But I don't think that's your problem.

Well, if you post the decoded backtrace, I'm sure it will help the IDE
developers find your problem.  It looks to me like you've got something
strange going on with IDE and/or ide-scsi.
I'm not sure why you'd be seeing different behaviour between manual
mounting and autofs, but it may have something to do with timing.
