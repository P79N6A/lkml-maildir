I have a test program much shorter then the Oops
If someone wants to work from a Oops I will send
one, no maintainer was listed and the last Google
reference is about 2 years back, and it does not
seem to be about this issue.
This Oops both 2.4.22 and 2.6.0-test11
It results from a ARCH=um bugreport and
I kept making the test program shorter
This seems silly but one line to Oops?

/* test2 program to Oops shmfs mounted at /dev/shm */
/* yes it is dumb but unprivileged users should not be able */
/* to Oops the kernel regardless of how dumb the program */
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>
main()
{/* off 0 is "." off 1 is ".." off 2 is empty */
        seekdir(opendir("/dev/shm"), (off_t) 2);
}
