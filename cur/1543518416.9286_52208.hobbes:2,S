I think the kernel provides the correct result. The caller either has
to use '_BSD_SIGNALS_' or use code like this:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>
void foo(int unused) { puts("\7Alarm"); }
main(int x)
{
    struct sigaction sa;
    char buf[1];
    int i;
    memset(&sa, 0x00, sizeof(sa));
    if(x > 1)
        sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;
    sa.sa_handler = foo;
    sigaction(SIGALRM, &sa, NULL);
    alarm(1);
    i = read(0, buf, 1);
    printf("%d, %s\n", i, strerror(errno));
}
Depending upon whether anything is on the command-line, the SA_RESTART
flag is set. This allows one to get both kinds of behavior with no
problems. I think the kernel code is correct.
Cheers,
