The reason I am questioning this point is the GIT README file.
Linus makes explicit that a "blob" is just the "file contents," and that
really, a "blob" is not just the SHA1 of the "blob":

And he defines "TREE" with the same name: blob

Therefore, "TREE" must be the *full* data, and since we have the following
definition for CHANGESET:

That each changeset remembers *everything* for *each point in the tree*.
Linus, if you actually mean to differentiate between the full data
and a SHA1 of the data, *please please please* say "blob" in one place
and "SHA1 of the blob" elsewhere.  It's quite confusing, to me at least.
Also, the details of just what data constitutes a 'changeset' would be
lovely... i.e. a precise spec of what Pat is describing below...
