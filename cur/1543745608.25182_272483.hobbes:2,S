Thanks Andrew, this indeed caused a deadlock.  Strangely the deadlock
happens much more easily if 'usemem' is not run in parallel with
'bash-shared-mapping'.

The medal is yours!
Apologies to everyone whom I disbelieved, and thanks for enlightening me.
The solution I'm thinking is along the lines of accounting the number
of writable pages assigned to FUSE filesystems.  Limiting this should
solve the deadlock problem.  This would only impact performance for
shared writable mappings, which are rare anyway.
Thanks,
Miklos
