Hello!
  I have dual processor motherboard with IO apic. All was fine till I added
  one more card in.  M/B has 5 PCI/2 ISA slots on it. 
  Now I have (from 1st to 5th PCI slot) 3 realtek 8029 cards,
  Adaptec SCSI card (this one is detected as 2 devices scsi devices),
  and SMC1211TX EZCard 10/100 (RealTek RTL8139). 
  Motherboard initially assigns irqs below 16 to all devices,
  But then linux rearanges these irq alocations.
  Assigned irqs:
ccssu:~# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      79973      79426    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       2259       2512    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:      59637      60742    IO-APIC-edge  serial
  8:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
 10:      33018      30528    IO-APIC-edge  serial
 12:       1270       1331    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
 13:          1          0          XT-PIC  fpu
 14:          7          1    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:         32         24    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 16:       4894       4716   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx, eth0, eth3
 17:       7272       7401   IO-APIC-level  eth1
 18:       2030       1997   IO-APIC-level  eth2
 19:       7628       7766   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
Now is the question: Why three devices on one irq line, when there is 
still some free irqs? How can I change things?
Yes, I have read Documentation/IO-APIC.txt, but seems that it deals with
blacklisted/unknown IO-Apics and assumes that whitelisted should be ok, or can
I use described method in my case too? Then what to do with SCSI card?
It eats 2 irqs and is shown as 2 PCI devices:
ccssu:~# lspci | grep AIC
00:0b.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7895 (rev 04)
00:0b.1 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7895 (rev 04)
BTW, I tried to change location of cards and IRQ layout was a little different
but stiil not desired. (e.g. I can get irq 16 shared between aic7xxx and eth0 
and irq 18 shared between aic7xxx with eth1)
Here is part of kernel booting messages regarding IO APIC:
