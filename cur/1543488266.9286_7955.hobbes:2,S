Hello!
> +int unix_nr_socks = 0;
I'd make:
atomic_t unix_nr_socks;
and coverted all bh protected ++/-- to atomic_dec/atomic_inc.
The only race is in limit checking and it is harmless,
because it can result in only in small overestimate of unix_nr_socks
(when timer ticks between atomic_read() and < max_files)
and does not affect anything, nobody could guarantee that
the same timer will not tick 1 usec later.
start_bh_atomic() is pretty expensive on SMP boxen. I'd avoid this,
when it is possible.

Ough, guys: it is wrong. Let's make it in more liberal way yet,
f.e. 
struct wait_queue *unix_global_ack_queue;
....
restart:
	/*  Find listening sock */
	other=unix_find_other(sunaddr, addr_len, sk->type, hash, &err);
	if (other && other->ack_backlog >= other->max_ack_backlog) {
		if (other->dead || other->state != TCP_LISTEN) {
			unix_unlock(other);
			return -ECONNREFUSED;
		}
		unix_unlock(other);
		if (nonblock)
			return -EAGAIN;
		sleep_on_interruptible(&unix_global_ack_queue);
		if (signal_pending(current))
			return -ERESTARTSYS;
		goto restart;
        }
	/* create new sock for complete connection */
	newsk = unix_create1(NULL, 1);
....
and wake_up_interruptible(&unix_global_ack_queue) on all --ack_backlog
Now behaviour in non-blocking case is still wrong,
(it should fall to EINPROGRESS), but it is not fatal:
I do not remember that someone used nonblocked connect() on af_unix
seriously.
On dgrams the same trick can be used, only using
sk->receive_queue.qlen instead of ack_backlog and some reasonable bound.
What do you think?
