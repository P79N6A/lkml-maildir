Hi Phil, I think you are right. When i look @ /boot (good way of seeing,
which & when) it tells me that my upgrade schedule was:
Aug 22  2001 bzImage-2.4.9
Sep 27 07:17 bzImage-2.4.10
Oct 12 04:27 bzImage-2.4.11
Oct 12 16:58 bzImage-2.4.12
Nov 8 17:26 bzImage-2.4.13
Nov 10 10:41 bzImage-2.4.14
Nov 24 10:46 bzImage-2.4.15
So apearantly 2.4.11 was dont use (2.4.12 followed later the same day in
my upgrade cycle). Then for almost a month no upgrades while running
2.4.12, and from there on folowing the kernel upgrade cycle again.
