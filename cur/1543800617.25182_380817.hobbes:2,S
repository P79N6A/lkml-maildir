I believe this option is inserted after "make xconfig", when "qconf" window 
appears. Sorry for this, it is my first time compiling the kernel. Perhaps it 
is not bad ideia to say what I'm doing:
In /usr/src/linux:
 1. Ataching the patch: 
# cat /root/via6410.patch | patch -p1
(I renamed the patch file to via6410.patch)
2.# make xconfig
3. # make 
    # sudo modules_install install
4. Reboot.
All this went with no error messages and the system reboots OK, with the new 
kernel in the Lillo boot options.
Regards and thanks for your help.
João
