> patch-scripts has the "patch-bomb" script,
Aha - interesting.
Actually, I was asking a loaded question.  I just finished writing my
own patch bomber.  I see a few details in your patch-bomb worth stealing
- thanks.  Mine is more driven off of a single text file, that specifies
what files, with what subjects, to send to whom.  And its in Python.
The big feature (?) mine has is to set the Message-Id, In-Reply-To and
References fields so that all but the first one in the set appear to be
followups to the first one, for those using threaded email readers.
Hard to do that with smtpsend in the shell ;).
