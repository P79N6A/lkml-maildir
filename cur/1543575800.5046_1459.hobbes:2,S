I locked a Cyrix III machine up on boot and hat these both
elements in my trace, too.
It Oopsed and locked up after the Message: "CPU: Before vendor
init".
I locked up too with another machine (Pentium Classic) but like
all others by using X.
I have no oops yet of this lockup, because of X, but I'll ask a
friend of mine, whether the remote logging made it to him and
send you the results.
PS: I tried test12-pre8, so its inside test12-pre8 already.
