No, copyright law is very relevant here, because if blob of code A does
not infringe the copyright of blob of code B, then there is no need for
A's author/distributor to give a darn about the license B is distributed
under.
All license inquiries, whether for GPL or any other license, should really
start with the question "do I need the licensor's permission to do this?".
For software, that inquiry is a copyright question (and maybe a patent
question).
