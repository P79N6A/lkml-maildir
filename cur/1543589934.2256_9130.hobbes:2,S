No, "cp" is still not a safe way to update libc, and I doubt it ever will be.
cp does _not_ create a new inode (unlike mv), so you are writing "garbage"
into the currently running executables.
NB: my open(2) says for O_CREAT "If the file does not exist it will be
created".  This is _not_ the same as O_EXCL, which will only mean that
open(2) will fail when it tries to create a new file.
Cheers, Andreas
