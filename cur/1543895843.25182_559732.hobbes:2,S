Yes.  Some day you may.  And then what will you or anyone else be able
to do about it?

It's just stating the obvious.  The upgrade path is a nightmare.
A long-sighted decision should have established *some* means for a
quick fix should it be needed.  It didn't have to be GPLv2+.  In fact,
per the stated goals and general feelings, it probably *shouldn't* be
GPLv2+.  But cutting any reasonable possibility of fixing a legal
problem in the license is short-sighted, yes.  It's putting too much
trust in the perfection of the license *and* the worldwide legal
systems *and* legislators.

And what makes you think even *he* can change the license?

I would like him to, yes.  But this is besides the point.  That I see
reasons for an upgrade, and that I'd like such an upgrade, doesn't
make any difference whatsoever about the plain fact that relicensing
Linux today, to any other license and for whatever reason it was,
would be a nightmare, and that this is a consequence of the
short-sighted decision of not establishing a relicensing procedure.
At this point, the situation is very much like a kernel installed in
ROM.  Who knows that nobody will ever find security bugs in it?  How
would you go about fixing them?

Huh?  It looks like you're talking about something unrelated with
license patching procedures.  I don't think Linus ever responded in
that thread to my suggestions of various means to establish a license
patching procedure.
