My previous comment is (probably) wrong :-).
I've just checked all PCI drivers and don't see anything preventing this.

It is not logical place - you got 1 <chipset> /proc entry per PCI device(s).
ide_pci_register_host_proc() (as done in first patch) is more logical.

ie. if <hwif> entry is registered before second (serialized) port is probed,
see proc_ide_write_config() for details.
