Thanks. It worked (and I don't see any screen corruption).
Maybe I'm missing something, but is there anything wrong with
video=matroxfb:vesa:0x1B5 ? I got
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=3 root=307 acpi=off noapic video=matroxfb:vesa:0x1B5
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25
matroxfb: Matrox G400 (AGP) detected

matroxfb_crtc2: secondary head of fb0 was registered as fb1
and the monitor was black on part (a few cm) of the left side,
although everything was on the screen.
It worked fine with what I'm used to, 1024x768x32bpp;
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=3 root=307 acpi=off noapic video=matroxfb:vesa:0x1B8
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25

matroxfb_crtc2: secondary head of fb0 was registered as fb1
and with the default:

matroxfb: Matrox G400 (AGP) detected
matroxfb: MTRR's turned on

BTW, I'm pretty syre I only got the following warning compiling
as a module (GCC 2.95.4):
  CC [M]  drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.o
drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_base.c:1230: warning: `inverse' defined but not used
