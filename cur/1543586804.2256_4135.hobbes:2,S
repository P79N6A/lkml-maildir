I actually don't believe in putting email address in code.  They become
stale far too easily.  If you ever want to find me, type my name
into a Yahoo search.  I did this today and was a little surprised at
the number of acurate hits. ;-)

You should really check the archives before posting to LK.  This has
been discussed *a lot*.
The version that was released in 2.4.3 was stale weeks prior to
that final kernel cut.  I'm working on getting revised versions into
2.4.4.  If you want to upgrade to something newer, try the 6.1.9
release from here:
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~gibbs/linux/
Just be sure to configure the bus settle delay to 5000ms as the default
in that release causes a timeout.
You can also configure the aic7xxx_old driver.
