What is your GCC version?

It was Linux? What kernel version? Did you try copying with that kernel?

You may try to repeat your test with:
* newer / older kernel (maybe this is a kernel bug?)
* newer GCC (miscompiled kernel?)
* different fs (ext3 bug?)
* different hardware (last resort to rule out hw problems)
