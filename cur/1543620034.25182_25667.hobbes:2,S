At what point do your machines stop booting, i.e., what was the last
printed kernel message on the console?  Also, can you send me full
dmesgs from your machines after booting?
I'm trying to corelate these issues with APIC issues I've had in the
past (and I'm thinking of getting the A7M266D at some point).
Thanks,
