Why is this a problem?  I seem to recall a real hypertransport bus
downstream of the Intel cpu.
If there is a real hypertransport bus in the middle then what happens
if someone puts a tunnel that uses hypertransport between the two chips?
I feel very dense right now.  I don't understand why enabling the
mapping on an Intel based system is a problem.  I am afraid there is
some important gap in my understanding in which case we may need to
rethink enabling the hypertransport capability by default.
If disabling the hypertransport bus is simply an optimization, or it
is to deal with an issue that appears exclusive to Nvidia chips
I have no problem with your quirk.
