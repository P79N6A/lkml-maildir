I've got a system that seems to have moments during the day that it swaps
very hard, during that time processes cannot allocate memory, yet there is
about 300 megs of swap space free.  What should I do to fix the problem?
I'm guessing I can up the ndirty parameter in bdflush, and up tries_base in
kswapd?  Someone's input would be cool.. thanks
