I forgot the compile log ... 
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xdbac): In function `fb_mmap':
include/asm/io.h:73: undefined reference to `__ioremap'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xdbbc):include/asm/io.h:73: undefined
reference to `__ioremap'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
adding following line to include/asm-alpha/io.h fixed compile:
#define __ioremap(a,s) alpha_mv.mv_ioremap((unsigned long)(a),(s))
