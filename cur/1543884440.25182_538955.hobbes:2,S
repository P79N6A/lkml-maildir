The waits are queued, thus then can be "unqueued". It's quite simple to
extend futex_wait_queue() to support this, but again you are thinking of
locks while what I want is fast events.

Events are simple. A event is either signaled or not. A futex value 0 means
not signaled, 1+ signaled.

If it's really worth, I have no problem with it.
