Backwards compatibility was dropped as part of the original review
complaints against mainlining.  The new 4.0 layout was necessary to address
some issues again relating to the original review complaints.  The 4.0
layout is designed to hopefully not require any further modification in the
future.
Ultimately this does mean the Squashfs mainline code will never be able to
read older filesystems.  But, unsquashfs will always be able to read all
filesystem versions, and I'll maintain out-of-tree patches that add
backwards compatibility to the kernel code for those that need it.  This
should be finished in the near future.
