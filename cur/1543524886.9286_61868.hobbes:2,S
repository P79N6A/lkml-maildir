Wrong. All GigE cards I have checked so far have interrupt mitigation. At init
you program them to delay IRQ until that many packets are in the queue or a
timer expires and the timer value. The only problem is that these are usually
not passed as module params. So you have to recompile if you find your current
mitigation params bad.

Wrong, see above.

See above. If you program a sane GigE NIC correctly you actually transfer more
than 8K at a time. Donald Becker's hamachi driver is a good example.
