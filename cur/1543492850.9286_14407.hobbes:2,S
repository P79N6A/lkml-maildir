The bridge code needs to call
	call_in_firewall(PF_BRIDGE, skb->dev, skb->h.raw, NULL,&skb)
for each frame it plans to accept
	call_out_firewall(...)
for each frame it plans to send
and
	call_fw_firewall(..)
for each frame it plans to forward
You may well only want to implement some of these for a bridge.
These routines return
	FW_ACCEPT	-	accept packet
	FW_REJECT	-	discard and error if you can
	FW_DENY		-	throw away quietly.
and may replace the sk_buff you pass it with a new one (thats how masquerade
works).
That puts the firewall hooks into the bridge. The other half is to register
a firewall handler for PF_BRIDGE. That probably wants to call the IP routines
if you are going to be doing just IP filtering.
