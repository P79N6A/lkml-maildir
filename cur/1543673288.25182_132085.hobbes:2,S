Hi Marcello
Here is a patch I sent to lkml a few days ago. It tries to fix a problem
with 2.4.21-rc1 ide driver Makefile.
drivers/ide/Makefile is broken on 2.4.21-rc2 (it's broken at least since
2.4.421-pre6. 2.4.20 is OK).
I try to build a kernel with Old hard disk (MFM/RLL/IDE) support only
(I don't need the Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tape/floppy support).
Here is my .config:
#
# ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support
#
CONFIG_IDE=y
#
# IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block devices
#
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_ONLY=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
# CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB is not set
# CONFIG_DMA_NONPCI is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_PDC is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_HPT is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_SII is not set
The resulting kernel has no support for ide hard disks:
# ls -l drivers/ide/*.o
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            8 apr 23 08:56 drivers/ide/idedriver.o
#
The following patch fixes the problem for the x86 arch (sorry, I have no
access to other archs).

  # RAID must be last of all
I used a x86 computer running a debian woody (gcc 2.95.4, glibc 2.2.5)
to build the kernel.
