I believe it is turned on by default.

It did NOT help.
Anyway, system is toshiba satellite 4030CDT with 64Meg of ram. Strange
thing is that I'm not able to boot with mem=63M. mem=60M works fine,
mem=8M works, too.
During bootup (and before crash), I can see a list for a short
while. Therefore, I copied only (usable) + interesting lines.
654336 @ 0 (usable)
65929216 @ 100000 (usable)
512 @ 100b6e000 type 4
It looks sane to me.
Does it help?
