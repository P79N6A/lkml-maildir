How about explaining _exactly_ what it does? This is still a somewhat
mysterious description. "generic optimisations" what is that ?

All that it seems to do right now is set the cacheline size to the
same as it would if the kernel was compiled for P4, regardless of
what target CPU is selected, so that for eg, an i686 kernel won't
perform any worse on a P4, saving vendors shipping seperate P4 kernels.
it should also note what performance impact (if any) users of this
option will see if they run such a kernel on a box with a smaller
cacheline size.
If this option ever does anything else, that too should get documented here.
