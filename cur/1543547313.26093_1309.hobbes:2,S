Well, the vmpatch still didn't fix the problem I've been having for many
moons (I believe since late 2.3.99) - When running updatedb from the
slocate distribution, I lose at least 90 MB of memory by the time it's
finished, and it takes about a day for the memory to become usable again -
this is not cached/buffered mem, it just disappears off the face of my
computer.
