It looks like libata pretty much needs to do PATA, in this case and a 
couple others.  Promise sent me a couple 2037x test cards with a PATA 
port on them, so just now need the time... :)
Getting PATA disks working should be very, very easy.  Getting ATAPI 
devices working requires some libata core hacking, though the ATAPI code 
is mostly there already.
