Ok.
Then we need to open the second discussion which is:
Given a file handle 'X' how do I find out what ioctl groups I should apply to
it. So we can go from
	if(MAJOR(st.st_rdev) == ST_MAJOR)
		issue_scsi_ioctls
	else if(MAJOR(st.st_rdev) == FTAPE_MAJOR)
		issue_ftape_ioctls
	else ..
	else
		error
to
	/* Use scsi if possible [scsi, ide-scsi, usb-scsi, ...] */
	if(HAS_FEATURE_SET(fd, "scsi-tape"))
		...
	else if(HAS_FEATURE_SET(fd, "floppy-tape"))
		..
