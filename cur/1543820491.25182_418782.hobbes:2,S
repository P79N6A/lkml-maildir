Subject: [patch 1/4] rtmutex: Remove buggy BUG_ON in PI boosting code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/25/196

From: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>
The condition in that particular BUG_ON can legitimately be the
case, if you have processes A, B, C, D, and E holding the
following locks in this scenario:
 L1 <=blocks= A
               <=owns= L2 <=blocks= B <=owns= L4 <=blocks= D
               <=owns= L3 <=blocks= C <=owns= L5 <=blocks= E
Where the priorities of these tasks are
    B,C < A < D = E
B and C are less than A and A is less than D and E where D and E are
equal (actually it probably works when D and E are not equal too).
As D and E climb the chain, there's a very slight race condition that
could allow for the condition in the offending BUG_ON to be true.
