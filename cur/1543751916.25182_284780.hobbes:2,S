I was thinking that for a sufficiently slow CPU running at 100% (hence the
lowly 386),  the throughput would be influenced by how efficiently we can
get in, get the Tx set up and get out.

Using rdtscl over the  area affected by the patch on the two variants for a
sample  of 234 small packets, I see an average of 4141 for using the
existing stack scratch area, and 4162 for using skb_padto.   That is a
difference of about 0.5%, which is significantly less than the typical
spread in the samples themselves.  To help give a relevant scale,  feeding
it a larger 1400 byte packet comes in at around 60,000 cycles on this
particular box.   Am I being optimistic to see this as good news -- meaning
that there is no longer a need for driver specific padto implementations,
whereas it looks like there was back when you did your tests? 
Paul.
