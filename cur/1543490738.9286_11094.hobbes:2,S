Subject: intercepting syscalls (by setting pointer in sys_call_table)

not really useful, just playing around, but learned a lot through it...
what I do: change the entry for a syscall in sys_call_table to point
to my own funtion (which does a few printk() and then jumps to the
original pointer with the original arguments), using a module
(inserted: use my function, remove: re-insert original pointer into
sys_call_table).
question: is manipulating sys_call_table, changing the pointer, safe
(SMP)? not from a functional point of view, I know what I'm doing
(even if my system dies ;-) ), but is it SMP-safe? I read a little
arch/i386/entry.S, _very_ interesting, but doesn't help that much...
I'm asking because someone who tried the same on his SMP system
complained about a system crash when he unloaded the module, and the
only line of code for unload is
void cleanup_module(void)
{
        sys_call_table[__NR_(whatever-syscall-I'm-experimenting with)]
= origsockcall;
}
and now I'm trying to find the reason, not for any real purpose, only
for the sake of knowing-why...
Thanks!
