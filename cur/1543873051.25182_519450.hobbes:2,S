If everything is run at nice 0? (this was not the test case but that's what 
you've asked for).
We have:
X + GForce contribute a load of 1
lame x 2 threads contribute a load of 2
In RSDL
X + GForce will get 33% cpu
lame will get 66% cpu
In mainline
X + GForce gets a fluctuating percentage somewhere between 35~45% as far as I 
can see on UP.
lame gets the rest
The only way to get the same behaviour on RSDL without hacking an 
interactivity estimator, priority boost cpu misproportionator onto it is to 
either -nice X or +nice lame.
