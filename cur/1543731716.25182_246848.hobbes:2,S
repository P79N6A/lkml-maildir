I'd  do  that  quite  differently:  Collect metadata  about  files  in
extended attributes (which are  rather universally useable), and do it
from  an userspace daemon/application/file  manager plugin  which uses
dynamically   loadable   plugins   for   the  different   file   types
differentiated by libmagic.
This has nothing to do in the kernel.
