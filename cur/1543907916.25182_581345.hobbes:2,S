Good to hear, thanks all.
I'll ponder whether I want to rebase netdev-2.6.git#upstream (2.6.24 
queue) on top of net-2.6.24.  I might put it off until the pain 
threshold rises, or I might go ahead and do it.  Undecided.
Either way, I'll want you to push to Linus before I do, when the next 
merge window opens.
