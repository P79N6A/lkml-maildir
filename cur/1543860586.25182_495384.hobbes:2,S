This all sounds wonderful, and also means that if/when ARM starts
implementing highmem, kmap becomes useful.  (When I looked at that
a while back, adding the necessary flushes where required would mean
that we ended up doing a lot of flushing all over the place.)

You'd still want to do the flushing on ARM because it's mostly VIVT.
Remapping pages with VIVT would just makes things much worse.
So yes, this sounds like a great idea.
