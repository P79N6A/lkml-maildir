I've been using the current linus BK tree, which already has more than what
is in 2.5.26 in a dual pentium 100 machine with a buggy CMD640 machine without
problems up to now. 32 MB of memory, 16 MB of swap, old QUANTUM LPS210A:
 hda: 412110 sectors w/98KiB Cache, CHS=723/15/38
Did some light stress testing, swapping, etc, no problems up to now, and with
Rik's minimal rmap patch that is already at Linus BK tree. 8)
