  I only studied the code about network. I don't know how does
  the kernel write to /proc/net/route and /proc/net/ip6_flowlabel
  and so on. I can only find the read_proc routine (fib_get_procinfo)
  but cannot find the write_proc routine. Can you tell me where they
  are? Thanks a lot.

   Thank you.
