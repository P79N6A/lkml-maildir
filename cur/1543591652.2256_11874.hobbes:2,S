Patch looks generally ok.
Comments:
* you forgot to cc Elmer Joandi, the maintainer, who wakes up every now
and then :)
* When is aironet4500_card version string printed, for the modular case?
* did you actually trace the code paths to mark sure code marked __init
was never called by the pcmcia hotplug part of the code?  I just want to
make sure you didn't mark them __init due to an assumption based on
function name.
