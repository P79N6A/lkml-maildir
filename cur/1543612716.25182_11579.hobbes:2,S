i have an ApolloPro 133 and i made that in windoze with a program from somone 
called H. Oda. it was very well documented and i found tweaks for 4x 
interleaving, active paging control, and read around write for the ApolloPro
i wrote the tweaks in a sheet and modified /proc/bus/pci/00/00.0 with a hex 
editor ..... so there is something called setpci to make it easier? will read 
the man page later :)
the fact is that i dont remember the exact bits to tweak, i'm going to load 
windoze and look which bits i had to tweak again, so will mail them to you 
later.
i noticed an interesting increase in memory throughput (with a windoze bench) 
can anyone point a way to test mem throughput in linux so we can test if the 
tweaks work?
