Oh, and the modules list: 
 Module Size Used by Tainted: P 
 i2c-dev 4548 0 (unused) 
 i2c-core 13604 0 [i2c-dev]

I am not certain your problems are nforce2 type specific.
Standard response: I don't suppose you can try a different stick of ram?
The reason I say that is that oops were very uncommon on either the 
epox 8rga+ or albatron km18G-pro MOBOS upon which I developed my
patches. Hard lockups were pretty much all I experienced prior to the 
patches except for an occasional X fail. Base OS flavour I
use is Suse 8.2 including gcc version (web updates utilised)
The udma patches are really just a cleanup on the address setup timing so
I do not think that they are a factor. 
The local apic ack delay timing patch needs athlon cpu and amd/nvidia ide on in 
kern config to kick in. If you are using it then I highly recommend uniprocessor 
ioapic config as well to go with it to route the 8254 timer irq0 through pin 0 of 
ioapic as using the apic config alone leaves a lot of ints generated on irq7 
which can cause problems. (Reason for 8259 making them spurious on irq7 
is explained in 8259A data sheet)
Also I now use a small patch to fixup proc info - only if you are using 
the 64 bit jiffies var hz patch, avail here:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2003-12/0838.html
If you try acpi=off on boot and it is then not very stable then I think it has 
little to do with lockups patch as that is my fallback mode when I am 
playing with apic ioapic code. 
Another fallback I use at times is 
hdparm -Xudma3 /dev/hda
Hope this helps the confusion
Regards
Ross.
