All of that assumes a hierarchical security model (BLP, Biba). This
depends on whether you think "MAC" means:
    * specifically the hierarchical models BLP and Biba, or
    * any policy system where the rules are mandatory with respect to
      the users
The former would include SMACK, the venerable Argus Pitbull system (if
it ever gets ported to LSM), and the recent MLS work implemented on top
of FLASK. It would notably *not* include SELinux's Type Enforcement, 
AppArmor, or TOMOYO.
If you take the latter view (a I do) then the meaning of MAC_READ vs.
MAC_WRITE, and especially MAC_RELABEL_SUBJECT, becomes murky, e.g. I
have no clue WtF "relabel subject" means to AppArmor. But I can very
easily understand what "CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE" means to AppArmor.
So I'm with Casey; I support a simple 1-bit capability for MAC override.
