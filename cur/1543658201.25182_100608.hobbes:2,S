The 2.5 approach has the problem that it can start queuing writeback for
multiple fs'es on the same disk at the same time --- I wouldn't be
surprised if it increases thrashing in that case.  But I guess I'm not
too concerned about sync() performance itself, as long as the in-kernel
background writeback is being done sensibly.
