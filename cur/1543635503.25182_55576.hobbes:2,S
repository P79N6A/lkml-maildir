Then why do they appear on the screen 8)
There are cases (eg someone selling Linux entirely into the PRC) where there
are a billion plus potential users for whom English is not just an odd
language but has a totally bizarre character set.
I can't conceive of anyone in the EU/US etc wanting to do such translation
but if you get it for free then it means we got the design right and someone
may one day find a good use for it.
