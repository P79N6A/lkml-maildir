Hi,
I installed a fresh RedHat 9.0 distribution on my
system. I'm trying to compile kernel with a new
driver. The compilation steps I'm following are as
below:
* make oldconfig
* make dep
* make bzImage
* make modules
* make modules_install
Till 'make bzImage' everything succeeds. However,
'make modules' fails.
Can someone help me out with this? Are there any known
problems and solutions wit RH9.0 distribution of the
kernel sources? The kernel version is 2.4.20.
Thanks in advance!!
