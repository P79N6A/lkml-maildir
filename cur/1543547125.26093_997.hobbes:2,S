   The latest firmware for the 3ware 5000 family of controllers - 
Escalade 5.1 - allows for hotswap using standard ide removable 
drive bays. I was already using ide removable drive bays to reduce 
downtime in case i needed to do maintenance, but now the worry 
is gone if  it works as they advertise. Check the pdf included with 
the drivers for Linux for more information.
