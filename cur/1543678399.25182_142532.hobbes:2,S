           Summary: Getting very high CPU load on Laptop with ACPI
    Kernel Version: 2.5.72 (and others with new acpi code)
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: andrew.grover@intel.com
         Submitter: hanno@gmx.de
I own a fujitsu-siemens lifebook C6155.
With several linux-kernels containing the new acpi (2.5.x, 2.4.21+patch,
2.4.21-ac1), I get very high CPU-load every few seconds. It's even impossible to
listen mp3s.
top shows me that it's the process events on 2.5-kernels and keventd on 2.4-kernels.
This does not happen with 2.4.21-vanilla (without acpi-patch, but with acpi
enabled and working).
So the bug seems to be in the new acpi-system.
Attached is dmesg-output (with 2.4 and 2.5), the dsdt, lspci-output and a
screenshot of gkrellm showing the cpu-usage (on a system running nothing that
consumes cpu-power).
