"which CPU"?
There can be multiple CPUs. Even with a single thread:
	CPU1			CPU2
	mmu1
	switch to lazy
	mmu1 still active
		-- wakeup --
				mmu1 wakes up here, lazy process still busy on CPU1
	mmu1 still active	mmu1 active here too
				mmap()
				tlb-flush needs to flush both CPU's
				mmap()
				tlb-flush needs to flush just ONE CPU!!!
Note the important thing: the mmu context is active on both CPU's because 
of lazy TLB state, but you definitely do NOT want to keep on making cross-
CPU calls every single time the process is running. Remember: lazy TLB is
supposed to speed things up, not slow them down.
Your patch will either be buggy (I didn't look closely enough), or it will
do the cross-CPU call every single time the process changes its mappings,
simply because somebody has that mapping lazily on another CPU even though
its not actively using the user mode portion of it.
