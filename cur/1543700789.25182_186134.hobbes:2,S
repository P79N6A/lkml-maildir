Because of the numerous reboots and hangs I've seen with experimental patches 
I've also seen this, but it's not reiserFS fault. The problem is that most 
drives have write caching enabled and not all of them are safe with this. If 
you disable it with hdparm (hdparm -W 0 /dev/hd*) you'll find that open files 
during a hard reset or power outage will prevent those open files from being 
corrupted.
