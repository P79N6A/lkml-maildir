256 in 2.0, 1024 in 2.2
There is a patch to take 2.0 to 3000. The -ac releases (and eventually I 
hope 2.2 proper) have support for 2.2 handling very large numbers of file
handles

It wont just crash. Once you are talking 5000+ handles though it suggests
you need to look at your communication model. It may be 5000 handles is
the right answer, it may be that if you have little state and don't need
to do complex flow control you should use UDP - there are reasons ICQ
uses UDP for example
