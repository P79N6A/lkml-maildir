Ah.   You're using cardbus.  Please send lspci output.

The NIC driver is basically unchanged from 2.4.  It will be a
cardbus/PCI/northbrige/southbridge setup problem.
Look for suspicious dmesg output.  Compare the `lspci -vvxx' output for 2.5
and 2.4, see if any of the registers look different.  This will be hard.
