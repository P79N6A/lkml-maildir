Sure.  But I think its a very non-scalable approach; as soon as there's 
a second user who wants to do something like this, its worth going to a 
more ops or function-pointer path.

Well, it hasn't been an issue so far, because I've only been working 
with x86-32 where all hotplug memory is highmem.  But, yes, on x86-64 
and other architectures it would have to defer creating the mappings 
until it gets the pages (page by page).

Right.  I do that page by page in the balloon driver; each time I get a 
machine page, I bind it to the corresponding page structure and free it 
into the allocator.
And I skip the whole "echo online > /sys..." part, because its 
redundant: the use of hotplug memory is an internal implementation 
detail of the balloon driver, which users needn't know about when they 
deal with the balloon driver.

That's more or less what I've done.  I've grouped it as 1-4 when the 
balloon driver decides it needs more page structures, then 5&6 page by 
page when it actually gets some backing memory.

Sure.  The main problem is that 1-3 also ends up implicitly registering 
the new section with sysfs, so the bulk online interface becomes to 
usermode.  If we make that optional (ie, a separate explicit call the 
memory-adder can choose to take) then everything is rosy.

I think I mentioned it before.  If we 1) modify Xen to manage domain 
memory in large pages, 2) have a reasonably small section size, then we 
can reasonably do all memory management directly via the hotplug 
interface.  Bringing each (large) page online would still require some 
explicit action, but it would be a much closer fit to how the hotplug 
machinery currently works.  Then a small user or kernel mode policy 
daemon could use it to replicate the existing balloon driver's 
functionality.
