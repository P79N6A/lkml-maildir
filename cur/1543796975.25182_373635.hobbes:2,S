AIUI we can't even add 'extra' mode table entries -- we can only modify
existing entries, and we can't even set the full modeline information on
some systems because we haven't reverse-engineered the tables
completely.
It's done by copying the video BIOS into shadow RAM and modifying the
table in RAM. This isn't really much of an improvement over binary-only
drivers.
