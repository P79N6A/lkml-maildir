IMHO this is not a good example as there is really no reason to install
udev on such a box at all. Remember: KISS. Having a static /dev and
/etc/modules filled in (or even better, a monolithic kernel) is far more
reliable to administer.
On a desktop machine when you are plugging in various USB/Firewire/etc.
devices all the time udev works great. On a remote server there is no
real need for udev.
