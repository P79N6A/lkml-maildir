Oh sorry, I missed that patch. Looks like that patch already added the
required call to init_pci_config_tokens:
 void __init eeh_init(void)
 {
-       struct device_node *phb;
+       struct device_node *phb, *np;
        struct eeh_early_enable_info info;
        char *eeh_force_off = strstr(saved_command_line, "eeh-force-off");
+       init_pci_config_tokens();
+
+       np = of_find_node_by_path("/rtas");
+       if (np == NULL) {
+               printk(KERN_WARNING "EEH: RTAS not found !\n");
+               return;
+       }
+
