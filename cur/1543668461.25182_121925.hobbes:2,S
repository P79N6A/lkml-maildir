If you DROP the packet in a PREROUTING chain, that should work.  Since
the "filter" table doesn't have a PREROUTING chain, you need to use a
table that does, like the "mangle" table.  For example:
        iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP
should drop everything with a source in 10.0.0.0/8 without touching
the routing cache.
