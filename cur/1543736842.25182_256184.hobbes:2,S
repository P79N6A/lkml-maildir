Which kind of corruption are you seeing? I was seeing some non-silent
problems with an IDE drive connected in a Firewire/USB2 enclosure.
Using it with my iBook on MacOS X is perfectly ok, but trying to use the
drive connected to a USB 1.1 desktop (my main computer) under Linux also
presented problems when copying a large file (one of Dijkstra's talks).
This error, differently from yours, was consistent and produced a lot of
messages regarding the media of the "USB drive" being removed (!) from the
system (while it obviously wasn't) and it left me with corrupted
filesystems (I tried ext2/3, vfat and hfsplus, which are things that both
MacOS X and Linux can read).
I usually tried to use rsync to copy the files, but, if I remember
correctly, the problem would also manifest when using plain cp.
