That was a bit too braindead of a translation, yes. But it is x86 arch
code so it shouldn't be that large of an issue for big MIPS boxen etc.
I'll search & replace for stuff of this kind and wipe it out anyway.
This suggests a "cpumask strategy". Care to share more, like your take
on such things as
	p = req->task;
	cpu_dest = __ffs(p->cpus_allowed & cpu_online_map);
	rq_dest = cpu_rq(cpu_dest);
in kernel/sched.c?
