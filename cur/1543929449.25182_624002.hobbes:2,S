thanks for the patch and the extensive description. I've applied this to 
x86.git. Do you agree that this has no urgency for v2.6.24 and is thus 
v2.6.25 material?
would you be interested in doing a follow-up patch as well that just 
yanks all of the irq compression code? That would keep things nicely 
bisectable and testable - the second, larger patch would be a NOP in 
theory on most systems.
