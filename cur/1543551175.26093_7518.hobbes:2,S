You may want to, if you have Gnome installed, try out an app called
Zapping.  I had some weird problems with newer version of xawtv too (my
bad for not testing it further and sending bug reports to the xawtv
author(s), i've been pretty busy and i needed a quick fix at the time,
i'll get off my ass and do something about this soon i hope) but
zapping works really well and does a better job of syncing frames in a
larger window, it's at 
http://zapping.sourceforge.net
 (this is also a
good idea so u can see if it's xawtv that has problems, or if the
problem is kernel-level)
