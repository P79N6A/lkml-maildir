The short summary is that two people used Linus' import tools and because
of no error on his part, simply the way things worked out, that caused what
we call "duplicate keys" (a lot like duplicate inodes, a lot like it) when
the trees with the imported patch came together.  I wrote a script to fix
up the trees after the fact and the application of that script went wrong
in Linus' tree but was not noticed until later.  It started showing up as
pull errors and then we tracked it down.
The long explanation would take me too long to do in email, I have 
carpal problems and it would amount to writing a "how BK works" paper
and that's too much for me right now.  If you want to understand the
nitty gritty, we can go to voice and I'll tell you.  So far, talking
doesn't seem to hurt my wrists :)
