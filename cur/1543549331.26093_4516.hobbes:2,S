My system has both an Adaptec adapter and a Qlogic adapter.  The number of
disks on the Qlogic was variable (it was attached to a SAN).  The boot
disk is attached to the Adaptec.  If the Qlogic was probed first, then
linux could not find the root device, so I had to move the Adaptec 7xxx
above the Qlogic in hosts.c.
Is there another way to do this?  If so, I'd like to know.  If not, then
we need the same configurability with the new scheme.
