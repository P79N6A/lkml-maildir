that would be one approach. Another less sophisticated approach is to
have no binding whatsoever, rather some translation table to map two
unrelated devices.

it wouldnt quiet fit as a tun device. More like a mirror side of the 
guest eth0 created on the host side 
i.e a sort of passthrough device with one side visible on the host (send
from guest0-eth0 is received on eth0 in the guest and vice-versa).
Note this is radically different from what i have heard Andrey and co
talk about and i dont wanna disturb any shit because there seems to be
some agreement. But if you address me i respond because it is very
interesting a topic;->

on the host ip addr and the one seen on the guest side are the same.
Except one is seen (on the host) on guest0-eth0 and another is seen 
on eth0 (on guest).
Anyways, ignore what i am saying if it is disrupting the discussion.
