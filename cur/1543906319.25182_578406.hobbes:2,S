Subject: 2.6.22.1: hang with forcedeth driver?

Heip!
I have had few total hangs with 2.6.22.1 kernel. Everything suddenly 
freezes and nothing works (SysRq keys, pinging the machine from the 
network.) Neither syslog nor netconsole have any relevant messages. I'm 99% 
sure this didn't happen in 2.6.21.x kernels.
All hangs happened with relatively high network traffic (twice with mplayer 
using remote display, once with high network fs activity). I copied 
gigabytes of files over nfs but couldn't dupicatate the problem that way, 
but OTOH I have also watched hours of video without problems so the problem 
doesn't occur often. (In the mplayer case, the file I play is usually on 
remote nfs disk, too.)
I started using mplayer from a text console and today I finally managed to 
catch first bit of information. The machine hanged like before (even SysRq 
keys don't print anything) but there was one console message:
eth0: too many iterations (6) in nv_nic_irq.
Looking at the sources, it seems when too much works happens in a single 
interrupt, the driver tries to disable device interrupts (and prints above 
message). It doesn't seem to be expecting the machine to hang afterwards.
I guess the quick fix for me is to increase max_interrupt_work value so it 
doesn't get hit as easily.
I have nForce3 board and Athlon 64 X2 CPU (but using 32-bit kernel). I'm 
using the built in ethernet with forcedeth driver. I also have ATI/AMD 
binary drivers loaded, and at least in some of the cases, VMware host 
drivers, too.
