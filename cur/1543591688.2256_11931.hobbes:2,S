You're welcome to the data in any of them :)  The hardware I keep.

OK.  I'm getting a little distracted by thinking about the locking
and some latency comments I've heard various gurus make.  I should
probably stick to thinking about/measuring throughput.. much easier.
but ;-)
Looking at the locking and trying to think SMP (grunt) though, I
don't like the thought of taking two locks for each page until
kreclaimd gets a chance to run.  One of those locks is the
pagecache_lock, and that makes me think it'd be better to just
reclaim a block if I have to reclaim at all.  At that point, the
chances of needing to lock the pagecache soon again are about
100%.  The data in that block is toast anyway.  A big hairy SMP
box has to feel reclaim_page(). (they probably feel the zone lock
too.. probably would like to allocate blocks)
