But if the module system creates security holes in the security system,
shouldn't that be avoided?  Isn't this is a fundamental problem because
the new security module that is being loaded has no idea what state all
processes are in when the module gets loaded?
What do you think about only allowing init to load LSM modules i.e.
check in {mod,}register_security that current->pid == 1.  Then init can
load the policy from some file in /etc changeable by the administrator
before starting any other processes.  Then you don't have to recompile
the kernel to change policies, but you still need to reboot and can't
get into funky states.
