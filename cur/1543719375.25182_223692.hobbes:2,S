(please CC Ingo for scheduler related stuff too)
Previously (ie. pre sched-domains), pipe based wakeups would
unconditionally migrate the "wakee" onto the same CPU as the waker.
Great for benchmarks, but possibly not really essential for real
workloads, especially when tasks start getting pulled across NUMA
nodes (I'd be happy to be shown otherwise though).
sched-domains introduces instead a "soft bias" that attempts to
get wakers and wakees together. The concept is applied to _all_
types of wakeups, not just pipe based.
I think this is a slightly better scheme, but we could increase
the aggressiveness of the bias if it is proven to be useful.
I don't know why your taskset performance is lower. taskset should
completely take the scheduler out of the equation AFAIKS...
