Grr.  I got this -U8 mail *before* I got the -U7 mail.
All thruout these U# kernels, I get stalls in X(everything pauses, not sure if
remote pings stop).  Nothing shows in dmesg when this occurs.
I had been running rc kernels for awhile, without these problems.  I had not
run any mm kernels, but I have run all the U kernels(but not U7).
Compiling/rebooting.
