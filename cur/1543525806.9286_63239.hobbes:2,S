But we _have_ addressed request overrun.  You are confusing two related
but quite distinct things: the flow control you refer to is simply not
done at the request layer at all, but rather at a higher level
entirely.
First of all, user space generally does not create unbounded oustanding
IO request.  It can generate unbounded dirty data, but that's something
different.  Dirty data is cached for future writeback to disk, but that
writeback is not under the application's control (unless the user is
doing synchronous IO, in which case we have an obvious flow control
mechanism through which the application's performance will be
throttled).
So, when an application is doing a lot of writing, we need to perform
flow control to throttle the amount of dirty data allowed at once.  That
is already done, but it has nothing to do with the IO scheduling.
Once the writeback of that dirty data commences, _then_ we need to do IO
scheduling.  In fact, Linux does this in two stages: the bdflush code
queues IO for dirty buffers without any fancy elevator sorting at all;
and then the IO layer services those outstanding IO requests using the
elevator sort.
