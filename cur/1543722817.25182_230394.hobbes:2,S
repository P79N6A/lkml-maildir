Now you got me curious :-)
I have not seen anything conclusive on this yet. How sensitive is Linux 
to the attack? Some say it deals with it better than others did before 
they got "fixed", but with no hard evidence or a sensible explanation.
Lets assume you're on a FastEthernet pipe capable of delivering 144kpps. 
How "hard" would it be to exploit it in such a scenario, given we know 
the source port and approximate system time used on one of the ends?
Sure, on a FastEthernet your pipe is toast if someone really wants your 
arse anyway, but you don't want connections over other pipes, or 
internally, to die during such an attack.
