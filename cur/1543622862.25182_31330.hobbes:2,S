You're right. I did that for security reasons - making sure that nobody 
can execve a suid application and then keep on sending signals to it under 
the auspices of thread groups. I'd forgotten about that thing.
Maybe killing the other threads on execve _is_ the right thing after all, 
if that also gives us POSIX behaviour.
Who actually maintains the pthread library? I don't think they use 
CLONE_THREAD at all yet, right?
