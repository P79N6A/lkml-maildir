Hi,
	I would like to discuss where is the right root for soundcards in 
the sysfs tree. I would like to put card specific variables like id there 
(see /proc/asound/card0/id). Also, I plan to create link from 
/sys/class/sound tree to the appropriate card to show relationship. 
Something like:
/sys/<somewhere>/soundcard/0
/sys/class/sound/controlC0/soundcard -> ../../../<somewhere>/soundcard/0
	Any comments and suggestions?
					Thanks,
						Jaroslav
