Last time I checked (which is already a somewhat older kernel) without
the 4G option you can only only address nine hundred something out of
of your thousand and twenty four megs.
And I believe the highmem thing creates some overhead.
So if you can live without the ~100mb, keep it off. If you want it,
turn it on. Other people will probably tell you te exact effects of
highmem. Probably in hard to decipher english too:)
I kept it off for ages, myself, basically because I rarely use all my
1GB. I think it's on now.
