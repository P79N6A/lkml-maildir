On 2.5.55 ( and .54) I've enabled scsi host emulation built in the kernel. 
When I boot up with hdc=ide-scsi , it fails as it loads ide-scsi
scsi0: scsi host adapter emulation
VENDOR
TYPE       [ it recognizes my sony cdrw, then hangs for a bit then ...]
ide-scsi: abort called for 2
bad: scheduling while atomic!
It then does a series of call traces, repeating the "scheduling while 
atomic" message.
