Take a look at a thread from January starting at this point:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0101.1/0407.html
Basically the constraint you see is due to how Linux sets up the 4GB
address space on 32-bit i386 hardware.  If you need more than 1.9GB on
2.4.x, it's not too hard to change a couple constants in the kernel to
allow somewhat more.  Feel free to email me for more details if it is
not clear after reading the above thread.
Cheers, Wayne
