Not easily, at least not without creating a circular dependency problem.
Try it ;-)
I guess we chould create another subarch header file just for these if we 
really have to, but that seem like overkill.
If you can come up with a clean patch (check it compiles on uniproc with
and without IO/APIC turned on, and standard SMP as well), I'd really 
be interested to see it ... would be most helpful

Actually replacing CONFIG_X86_NUMA with CONFIG_NUMA ... and we could
do (CONFIG_NUMA || CONFIG_BIGSMP) instead. But you're right, subarch
would be much better if you can find a way.
