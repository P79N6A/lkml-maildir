One wonders if containers are a possible solution. I can already solve
this problem with virtualization: have one VM manage all the network
I/O and export the device as a simpler virtual block device to other
VMs. Provided this VM isn't doing any "real" work and is sized
appropriately, it won't get wedged. Since the other VMs now submit I/O
through the simpler block interface, they can avoid getting wedged
with the standard mempool approach.
If we can run nbd and friends inside their own container that can give
similar isolation, we might not need to add this other complexity.
Just food for thought. I haven't looked closely enough at the
containers implementations yet to determine whether this is possible
or if the overhead in performance or complexity is acceptable.
