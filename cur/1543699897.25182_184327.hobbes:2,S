Hi, Marcelo.  I haven't studied this patch, but the change above looks
suspicious.  The part added after the || makes the original condition
irrelevant (because the 2nd part is true if either the PF_MEMALLOC or
PF_MEMDIE flags are set).
Were you perhaps thinking of something like this?
	if ((current->flags & PF_MEMALLOC) &&
	    ((current->flags & PF_MEMDIE) || !in_interrupt())) {
Cheers.  -ernie
