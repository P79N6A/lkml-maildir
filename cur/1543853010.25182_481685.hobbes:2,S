well today you can already unbind from userspace.
The decision to bind automatically is the right one for the kernel,
since that is by far the most common one (99.9%+ of stuff has only one
driver ever) and also if you have no drivers it's just hard for udev to
run at all :)
udev can already unbind those few really rare cases it cares about, and
then do the other driver and bind that...... 
Now; there is a second issue. If the choice for one or the other is
consistent, we should consider fixing the kernel drivers to just not
advertise the b0rked one.. (this assumes that both drivers are in the
kernel and both are open source)
