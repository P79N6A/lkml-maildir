I hope you're aware that alt-sysrq-t has been broken for some time?
include/linux/sched.h:
#define TASK_RUNNING            0
#define TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE      1
#define TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE    2
#define TASK_STOPPED            4
#define TASK_ZOMBIE             8
#define TASK_DEAD               16
kernel/sched.c:
        static const char * stat_nam[] = { "R", "S", "D", "Z", "T", "W" };
fs/proc/array.c:
static const char *task_state_array[] = {
        "R (running)",          /*  0 */
        "S (sleeping)",         /*  1 */
        "D (disk sleep)",       /*  2 */
        "T (stopped)",          /*  8 */
        "Z (zombie)",           /*  4 */
        "X (dead)"              /* 16 */
};
So, for one more time, here's another mailing of the same patch to fix
this brokenness.  In addition, we fix the wrong comment in fs/proc/array.c
