1) The tarfile did not include "linux/include/iobuf.h"  (this causes a
problem in drivers/mtd/devices/blkmtd.c) 2) Copying iobuf.h  from 2.4.20
sources generates an error in function brw_kiosvec due to diffs in param
btw ver 2.4.20 and 2.6.0 (err = brw_kiovec(READ, 1, &iobuf,
rawdevice->binding, blocks, rawdevice->sector_size) => solved changing
the 4th param of  brw_kiovec (in 2.4.20 iobuf.h) to type struct pointer
3) At line 1199 of drivers/mtd/devices/blkmtd.c change "module" with
"owner" regards
