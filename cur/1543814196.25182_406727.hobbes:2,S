If you do it in this way, all thermal zone's _TMP will be faked.
If you remove the real THM0._TMP, and fake a dummy THM0._TMP
in DSDT, and don't change anything in kernel, then if S3 works
well, I will be convinced that THM0._TMP was causing trouble.
Yes, I'm asking you to override DSDT for debugging. :-)
But, please make sure don't change other things in DSDT, otherwise
it still won't be trusted. :-)
Anyway, I'm studying THM0._TMP, and try to figure out how it is related
with EC. 
Thanks,
Luming
