Couldn't an empty inline function do the trick?
include/linux/proc_fs.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS
....
extern int proc_register(....);
....
#else
....
static inline proc_register(....) {};
....
#endif
That should trick gcc into letting the function dissapear.
(I don't know how that would affect other kernel stuff
though ... it might be Very Bad(tm) for some things)
