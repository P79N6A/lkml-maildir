(well, DPT doesn't exist anymore and we all know how talkative Adaptec isn't)
Last time I checked my bank accounts, I wasn't making any money from
supporting linux.  Of course, I'm a registered I2O developer.  And, the
I2O SIG has alot of money to use in chasing after people.
It might be a problem for places like Redhat, Suse, etc. that sell linux
distributions.  Of course, the GPL has the same clause and no one's had
a problem with selling linux distributions so far.
