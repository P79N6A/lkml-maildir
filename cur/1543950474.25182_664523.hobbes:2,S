I'm not sure what you mean.
If dev->parent is NULL, we get into the "successful" branch where the device is
added to dpm_active.  Do you think we should add any extra handling of this
case?

Well, I don't think it's necessary.  dpm_active is empty in that case and
we can use the list_empty(&dpm_active) check instead.
