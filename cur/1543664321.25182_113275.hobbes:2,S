I think you're close to the truth there, but out-of-order inode table access 
would only introduce one seek per inode table block, and the cache should 
take care of the rest.  Martin's numbers suggest the cache isn't caching at 
all.
Martin, does iostat show enormously more reads for the Htree case?
