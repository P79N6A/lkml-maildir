Heh:
      Three levels of indirection are currently supported:
       - single indirection
       - double indirection
somebody has trouble counting.
More seriously, I'd _really_ love to see something like a "swapfs", ie 
tmpfs with cachefs as a backing store. It would be a lot more useful for 
testing that AFS+cachefs, and would hopefully also act as a example of how 
to use it _without_ having to worry about AFS.
Is that possible?
