You can spend all week telling us how easy it would be to implement
all the CML2 benefits that CML1 doesn't have, if you like -- but one
of the rules of this game is that an ounce of working code beats a
pound of handwaving.
When you've shown the list the bundle of CML1 implementation and 
rulesfile patches that brings CML1 up to snuff, *then* you'll have
grounds to argue that the switch to CML2 gains nothing.  
So don't talk about it, *do it*!  Whether you succeed or fail, one of
the two of us will get a valuable education from your attempt.  And
until you succeed or fail, arguing is just wasting everyone else's time.
