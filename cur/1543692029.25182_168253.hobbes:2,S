I presonally would like to be able to choose if I want to use the PS/2
driver or not.  Mainly because a couple of machines I have here, use the
old AT keyboard (DIN-5 connection, not PS/2 or USB), and have <128MB
RAM.  For instance, how many 386 computers have you seen with at least
32MB RAM & PS/2 or USB sockets? [1]
(And yes, I probably would be crazy enough to go put Linux 2.6 on to a
386, I've considered installing Gentoo on one actually -- just to see
how long it takes :-D)
Footnotes:
1. I've only seen one exception to this, that is one old (also dead)
Olivetti 386 laptop which had PS/2 keyboard & mouse sockets.
