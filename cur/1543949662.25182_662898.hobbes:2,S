Hm, after ~24h of uptime, this message appeared 25 times already.
The WLAN USB device was used the whole time, the usb-storage module
was hardly used over the day:
# grep usb /proc/interrupts
  10:   10693403    XT-PIC-XT        ohci_hcd:usb3, eth0
  11:   10270770    XT-PIC-XT        sym53c8xx, ehci_hcd:usb1
  12:         91    XT-PIC-XT        ohci_hcd:usb2
I even tried to trigger the system freeze[0] by using usb-storage
and reading a lot from it, but no freeze, and the message could
not be triggered either - they pop up every now and then, but too often, 
IMHO.
Can anybody shed some light on this?
Thanks,
Christian.
