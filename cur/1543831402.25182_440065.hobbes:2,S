ROTFL!
All the word isn't x86.  On ARM it's 3 words for the stack setup and
one for the tear down, so 16 bytes, assuming the function doesn't
return a value.  If it does, add another 4 bytes.
So, on ARM potentially 16 to 20 bytes per weak function.  That's a
1600% to 2000% increase on your estimate.
(Unfortunately we have to tell the compiler to always generate stack
frames otherwise we can't get call traces out of the kernel.)
