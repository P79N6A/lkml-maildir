Because you can change the behavior of the application and then bypass 
policy entirely by utilizing any mechanism other than direct filesystem 
access: IPC, shared memory, Unix domain sockets, local IP networking, 
remote networking etc.
This not even considering object aliasing (which would allow you to 
inappropriately access objects with full blessing of policy), as I'm 
assuming that the limited environment Alan is referring to entirely 
prevents them.
Also worth noting here is that you have to consider any limited 
environment as enforcing security policy, and thus its configuration 
becomes an additional component of security policy.
So, your real security policy is actually more complicated than it appears 
to be, is not represented completely in the policy configuration file, and 
must be managed disparately.  And it's still only capable of controlling 
access to filesystem objects.
