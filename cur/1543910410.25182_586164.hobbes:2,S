I must disagree with Andi on this point. Considering the quoted
paragraph below, misaligned/cross-cache-line updates are not atomic.
This is why I align the immediate values in such a way that the
immediate value within the mov instruction is itself aligned.
Intel System Programming Guide
7.1.1 Guaranteed Atomic Operations
The Intel386™, Intel486™, Pentium®, and P6 family processors guarantee
that the following basic memory operations will always be carried out
atomically:
• Reading or writing a byte.
• Reading or writing a word aligned on a 16-bit boundary.
• Reading or writing a doubleword aligned on a 32-bit boundary.
The P6 family processors guarantee that the following additional memory
operations will always be carried out atomically:
• Reading or writing a quadword aligned on a 64-bit boundary. (This
operation is also guaranteed on the Pentium® processor.)
• 16-bit accesses to uncached memory locations that fit within a 32-bit
data bus.
• 16-, 32-, and 64-bit accesses to cached memory that fit within a
32-Byte cache line.
Accesses to cacheable memory that are split across bus widths, cache
lines, and page boundaries are not guaranteed to be atomic by the
Intel486™, Pentium®, or P6 family processors. The P6 family processors
provide bus control signals that permit external memory subsystems to
make split accesses atomic; however, nonaligned data accesses will
seriously impact the performance of the processor and should be avoided
where possible.
