GNU libc doesn't have (nor need) its own "kernel" headers and uses the
kernel ones.
You may live with "glibc-kernheaders" package only if it matches your
system. If you're using a different (newer, modified etc) kernel then
you need the symlinks or a copy (example: new ioctls + programs using
them).
You may need to recompile the libc as well, if the libc-kernel (binary)
interface has changed.
