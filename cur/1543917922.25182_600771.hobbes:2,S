Note the mention of "weird cases"
You come up with a general method, then you have to deal with exceptions 
to that general method.
Another example:  8139too and 8139cp both claim to support 
(0x10EC,0x8139) PCI IDs.  The distro installer needs additional 
information to know to read the PCI revision, which is what determines 
whether or not to use 8139cp driver.
Sometimes life is just not as simple as you would like it to be :)
