Makefile says:
# Use make M=dir to specify directory of external module to build
# Old syntax make ... SUBDIRS=$PWD is still supported
# Setting the environment variable KBUILD_EXTMOD take precedence
ifdef SUBDIRS
  KBUILD_EXTMOD ?= $(SUBDIRS)
endif
ifdef M
  ifeq ("$(origin M)", "command line")
    KBUILD_EXTMOD := $(M)
  endif
endif
so M= is apparently the newfangled (and undocumented) way of doing this.
