After you hit the reset button, the BIOS will perform a cold-boot
which means everything gets initialized from scratch. Aside from
the file-system rebuild that occurs when you improperly shut-down
a system, there should be no additional history and, therefore,
no difference in performance before and after your shutdown sequence.
If you execute `top` you should clearly see what process, if any,
is hogging the CPU.
