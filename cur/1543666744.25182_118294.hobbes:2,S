   I don't know the details of the userspace, but the data is generated in
   real time, it's like if you cat /dev/dsp | netcat -l on the server, and
   the receiver does netcat streamer xx >/dev/dsp
   
This streamer application should buffer at the sending side, in order
to keep the window full.  Introducing artificial delays on the sending
side of a unidirectional TCP transfer is really bad for performance
and I can assure you that more than just "weird delayed ACK" behavior
will result.
In fact, it is the most suboptimal way to send data over a TCP socket.
If you can't keep the window full, you do not end up using the
bandwidth available on the path.
I would not be surprised if the news pulling case you mentioned does
something similar.
