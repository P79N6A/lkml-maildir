Subject: Possible kernel bug: Time increases gradually in "date" command

Hello, this is my first time I've ever posted on this list. If you
need further info, do not hesitate, as I would love to get this matter
solved!

The problem:
Time increases faster than normal (which in turn makes timestamps in
logfiles go crazy).
I've been using ubuntu linux since dapper drake (6.06), ubuntu linux
edgy (6.10) and now ubuntu linux feisty fawn (7.04). I have noticed
that upon using ubuntu linux feisty fawn, the time in "date" command
shifts (increases gradually and faster than normal) while the pc is
turned on.
I use gnome desktop and in the time panel of gnome it shows the date
normally after a "refresh" of time using the command: sudo ntpdate
time.nist.gov ntp.nasa.gov
Yet after some time (when ntpd is disabled, even when it is enabled
sometimes) the problem reappears after a while, the time in "date"
command and in gnome time panel after some hours is way ahead than
normal.
I did not and do not have this problem in windows xp nor in earlier
ubuntu versions (I have tried a format of the root partition,
installed an earlier version of ubuntu linux - edgy 6.10 - and the
time was kept almost perfect! Then reinstalled ubuntu feisty 7.04 and
the time problem/bug reappeared)
I assume something changed in ubuntu linux feisty faw 7.04 causes this
bug to appear, maybe motherboard related or something else.
The full story of the possible bug is here as well:

+bug/104091
I have attached a clock.log.tar.gz, which contains a clock.log file.
clock.log was produced by this: hwclock && date
Example of the format is:
hwclock: Wed 13 Jun 2007 06:45:55 PM CEST  -0.093260 seconds
date: Wed Jun 13 18:30:01 CEST 2007
I used crontab to log the output of hwclock && date every 5 minutes,
giving me the freedom to further analyse it and prove my theory.
Notice how the time in the output of date command increases faster
almost every time.
