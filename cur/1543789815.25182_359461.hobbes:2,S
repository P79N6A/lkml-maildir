We have been using Mel's fragmentation patches.  One of the data structures
created by these patches is a 'usemap' thats tracks how 'blocks' of memory
are used.  I exposed the usemaps via sysfs along with other hotplug memory
section attributes.  So, you can then have a user space program scan the
usemaps looking for sections that can be easily offlined.
