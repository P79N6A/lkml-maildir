I think it has to be an option.  I'm sure that some peope under some
circumstances will just want to collect all the data, thank you very much.
And I doubt if it'll be a performance problem for them - the amount of CPU
time per exit will be small - if you're exitting at great frequency then the
stats collecion overhead rises proportionately.  That is to be expected.
There will be buffering in the channel, so we'd expect to gather thousands
of records per context switch.

yeah.
