Could you describe the deadlock, please?

I maintain it's the wrong interface, we're mixing two concepts together there:
  - VM can't find blocks that are freeable, so fails and dumps the problem
    on the caller, which has to busy wait.  This sucks.
  - The VM is under heavy load and the caller doesn't really need the memory
    that badly because it has a fallback, the VM somehow knows this, so fails
    the allocation and everybody is happy.
These should be separated, and we should fix the former.
