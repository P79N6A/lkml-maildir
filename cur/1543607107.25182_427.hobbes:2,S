Hi All,
I am getting repeatable machine freezes when trying to bring up a second
channel with my Elsa PCI ISDN card. The system is RedHat 7.1.
Whenever it attempts to bring up a second line I get a message saying
'alloc_skb clled nonatomically from interrupt c01f8c13'. The whole
machine then freezes and a reboot is required. The nearest symbol in System.map
is rtmsg_fib.
I've tried various different -ac kernels, from 2.4.10-ac4 upto 2.4.12-ac5
and all seem to exhibit the same behaviour
Regards,
Darren
