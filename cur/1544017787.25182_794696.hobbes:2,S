Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ingo,
The one patch I did here, will need to go to stable as well. I'll write
up a patch against stable, and as soon as it gets into Linus's tree,
it should also be pulled into stable as well. Without the patch, some
archs will not be able to perform any tracing. There is an alignment
issue that will cause the ring buffer to fail to commit any transactions.
