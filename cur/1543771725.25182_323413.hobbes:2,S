Slightly better but still not good enough.
Using my testing application it reports about 10 errors/sec (frame). 
Using iperf:
iperf -s -u -w 16m
------------------------------------------------------------
Server listening on UDP port 5001
Receiving 1470 byte datagrams
UDP buffer size: 16.0 MByte
------------------------------------------------------------
[  5] local 147.251.54.96 port 5001 connected with 147.251.54.34 port 32915
[  5]  0.0-10.3 sec    614 MBytes    502 Mbits/sec  15.220 ms 376630/814324 (46%)
[  5]  0.0-10.3 sec  1 datagrams received out-of-order
it is 46% packet loss but no errors on interface.
(peer is dual opteron box, my box is Pentium-M 1.6GHz, 512MB RAM).
Sending to peer using iperf:
iperf -s -u -w 16m
------------------------------------------------------------
Server listening on UDP port 5001
Receiving 1470 byte datagrams
UDP buffer size: 16.0 MByte
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 147.251.54.34 port 5001 connected with 147.251.54.96 port 1024
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec    836 MBytes    700 Mbits/sec  0.013 ms 290722/886955 (33%)
[  3]  0.0-10.0 sec  1 datagrams received out-of-order
This second case is a lot better than original driver from syskonnect which
flooded outgoing interface at rate 500Mbps and no more packets were transmitted.
Boxes are interconnected using GE switch which can handle about 920Mbps between
two dual operon boxes.
