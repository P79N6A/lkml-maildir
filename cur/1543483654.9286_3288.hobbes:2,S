  Inside there was something interesting.  My Large-File-Summit stuff
does need similar too -- although only in  printk() support, and only
when the BITS_PER_LONG is under 64 (all ia32 systems, of course).
Should we integrate something alike into the general  lib/  directory
in the kernel ?
For most of the gcc generated cases we definitely don't want to use
this -- when we are doing some filesystem internal code, for example.
(We don't want  __divdi3, __moddi3 et.al. with those gcc library calls!
 Rather we want carefully control where the uses occur.)
