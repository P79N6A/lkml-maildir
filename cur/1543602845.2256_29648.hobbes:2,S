Rik,
It seems to me that while you can get good information about the VM from
vmstat, it doesn't really give enough detail.
It doesn't give any info about the ages of pages, or anything detailed besides
sizes of memory caches, and amount of swaping.
I read not too long ago about someone mentioning a patch that lists the ages
of pages via a proc interface...
Does anything like this interest you?
