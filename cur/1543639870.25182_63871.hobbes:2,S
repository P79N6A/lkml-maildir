Yes.  That's my current plan.

Ugly - I'd rather not have to do it that way. (:

sed '/dep_/s/ \$CONFIG_/ CONFIG_/g' is quite effective.  In any case
it is not hard to support both syntaxes - once the transition is
complete, or reasonably complete, we can change the semantics to
'n'=='', which in Configure/Menuconfig can only be enforced in the
non-$ case (well, unless we use your 'source' statement idea).

The problem with "intuitive for people who know sh" is that people
think Config.in *is* shell.  They start putting in constructs which
are not valid Config.in syntax but which *are* valid sh syntax, so
they work with certain parsers but not others.
Mutating the language, long-term, so that it looks less like sh and
more like a specialised language, is IMO a worthy goal.  And I think
it can be done.  The main thing to deal with is adding an alternative
syntax for 'if' statements which doesn't look like test(1).  More
about that in a separate message.

See above - 'if' is due for an overhaul as well.

You mean the case where
  A=y implies B=n
  B=y implies A=n
  A=m implies B<=m
  B=m implies A<=m
I agree.  Not sure if it needs special casing or just better general
facilities.  I think it can be well served by the dep_* !CONFIG_FOO
patch, where !y==n, !n==y, !==y, and !m==m.  Then
  dep_tristate CONFIG_A !CONFIG_B
  dep_tristate CONFIG_B !CONFIG_A
