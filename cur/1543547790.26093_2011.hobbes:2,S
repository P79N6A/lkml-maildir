Amen,
The main issue for me is also for support.  It's really nice to have an
integrated kernel debugger so if a customer has a problem, you can send
out trained folks to track stuff down more quickly since they can poke
around the system.  It's also great for diagnosing customer problems
remotely.  As for what Alan said, I say amen to every word and agree
with everything he said.
