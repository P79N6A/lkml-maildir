Don't blame fast-math, if I undestood what you did...
With single-precission floats, you just have 7 digits of precission
(scientific notation) [1].
If you ask printf() to write 15 decimal places, it just _lies_.
How does it invent the rest of decimals, is up to glibc. Just
get glibc sources.
In short, anything past the 7th digit is crap, and can be different
depending on the box, cosmic rays and a butterfly waving its wings.
