The tap only sends a button one event. As far as the Press to Select
qualities are concerned, the necessary options are exposed by the
driver in the sysfs filesystem now. Understanding their  effects on
how a press, drag, double press is detected is another matter.
I'll send a 2.6.11-rc4 based patch later today for consideration.
