With attrs defaulting to on I don't think 'reiserfsck --clean-attributes' can 
be the solution. There are just too many filesystems that are affected. So 
for now I also won't clean up the attributes ;)
Since Sergey already proved that directories always have the old format, I 
didn't test your patch, but tried Sergeys patch.
Thanks for all of your help,
