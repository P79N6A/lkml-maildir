VFS provides a common interface to the filesystem.  I don't think metafs
needs any VFS changes.  It may be able to get by without making changes
to the VFS, and if so, it shouldn't touch the VFS.  It should just be
its own separate filesystem.
I imagine most of it could be implemented by a FUSE filesystem.

Of course.  With file-as-dir, you can "cd /usr/games/tetris/..." and
mess with the game files, or you can run "/usr/games/tetris" and get on
with ... stacking blocks.  The advantage of doing it in the kernel is
that you don't need extra support from the applications (or GnomeVFS or
KDE).  So typing "/usr/games/tetris" from the command prompt does the
same thing as double-clicking it in the file manager.  Of course, this
change does require file managers to understand default actions when
it's ambiguous what to do on a double-click -- but MacOS X has that too,
in the form of the "Open as Folder" option (or whatever it's called).

You mean patch them all so that they understand and can edit
xattr/substreams/etc.?  The file-as-dir interface is meant to avoid
having to do that.  metafs also avoids having to patch all the
applications by exposing them as regular files.
The example you give below isn't a new VFS API.  It's metafs exposing
xattrs/substreams/etc. through the regular file interface.  (Perhaps
we're just using different terminology.)

Agreed.
