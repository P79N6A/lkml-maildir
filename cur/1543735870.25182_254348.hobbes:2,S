Hello everybody!
Will /sys provide details about link status of network cards
and can I also find out what devices are harddisks?
Like having /sys/block/hda/type, which contains "cd-rom" or
"harddisk" or similar. 
Or having something like /sys/class/net/eth0/link with 0/1 setting?
I know some or all information can be retrieved somehow differnt
(like using /proc), but shouldn't those be found in /sys?
Just some question on how we can use /sys useful.
Greetings,
Nico
