You just might be hitting a TSC related problem, see bug #5105 at
bugzilla.kernel.org. In that case you will probably see funny timings
when doing an strace -tt of the xclock program, for example.
A workaround for i386 kernels is "clock=pit" on the kernel commandline.
In x86_64 mode, try "notsc" instead. Well, try that anyway but it didn't
work in my case.
