Here's something interesting too:
Sometimes, an oops is even longer than 25 rows, and the usual user
does not have
 - VGA mode with a lot of lines (because it's hard to read)
 - FB mode with a lot of lines (slow, and it's also hard to read)
Is it be possible to change the VGA mode to 80x43/80x50/80x60
during protected mode?

It would be ideal to have something like BSD's "dump to predefined 
block device on oops", so extraction of oops logs requires neither 
pen-and-paper nor a digital camera. Requires another partition that
can be used for it, though.

Oh yes, include Stas Sergeev's PCSP patch and play a WAV telling "your box 
just crashed, wait two minutes for uh ... an oops you can't grab 
either"(*).
(*) If the oops is longer than 25 lines, ... you can't even use scrollback 
because scrollback is cleared when you change consoles. X runs by default 
on tty7, and the kernel dumps it somewhere else. (And even if it dumped to 
tty7 directly, you would not see it.)
