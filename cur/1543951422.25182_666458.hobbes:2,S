Its certainly "more traditional" method of doing hibernation than
tricks swsusp currently plays. Yes, I'd like these patches to go in,
being able to switch kernels seems like useful tool.
Now, I guess they are some difficulties, like ACPI integration, and
some basic drawbacks, like few seconds needed to boot second kernel
during suspend.
...OTOH this is probably only chance to eliminate freezer from
swsusp...
Yes, I'd like to see this to go ahead.
No, this does not make swsusp obsolete just yet.
