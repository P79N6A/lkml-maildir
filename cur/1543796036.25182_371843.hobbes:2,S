I did a similar patch some time ago, but it allowed to execute a program
instead of allowing fifos with the core on stdin. IMHO that's a better
usage model because it doesn't require a daemon (and if you want one
you can use a trivial forwarder) 
I didn't post it because it still needed some cleanup and
double checking of a few corner cases and ran out of time for that.
I agree it's very useful. In my case the idea was to do 
automatic crash reporting. I wrote some simpleminded backup
scripts for that.
If there is interest I can dig it out. I think it was already
in better shape than your patch ;-)

That's a exploitable root hole and a likely crash I think.

You're holding a spinlock over operations that can sleep like
write or truncate? That's totally wrong.
