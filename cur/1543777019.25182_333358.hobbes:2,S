I meant that 32 retries is too many. Retries tend to multiply.
If OS does N retries per failed attempt and disk drive does M
attempts per attempt, you end up with N*M retries.
Add a few 'retrying' layers, and you have a 'I cannot umount
this fscking scratched CDROM, maybe tomorrow' type disaster.
It's better to err to the smaller number of attempts.
