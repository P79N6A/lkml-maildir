I think you have a timing issue.
The USB input driver is loaded and started before init starts, but it
takes an ammount of time before the USB device is seen by the USB core
and initialized.  This seems to happen _after_ init starts up :)
Other than simply sitting and spinning in the USB init code for all of
the devices to be found before continuing on, I don't know what could be
done for this.
Anyone else have any ideas?
thanks,
