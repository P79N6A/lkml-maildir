This failed to build on two x86_64 machines I have access to with (one
on test.kernel.org);
  OBJCOPY arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin

CONFIG_NR_CPUS was 8. The build log can be seen at
http://test.kernel.org/abat/45342/debug/test.log.0
 and the .config is at
http://test.kernel.org/abat/45342/build/dotconfig
 . I haven't done any
further investigation in case this is a known problem. If it's new, I'll
start digging.
