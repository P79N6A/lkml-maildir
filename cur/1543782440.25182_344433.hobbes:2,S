What GigE adapters did you use? Clearly every
driver is going to be different. My experience is
that a 3.4Ghz P4 is about the performance of a
2.0Ghz Opteron. I have to try your tuning script
tomorrow.
If your test is still set up, try compiling
something large while doing the test. The drops
go through the roof in my tests.
