True, but now with this code change, you have (acceptable or not) made
binary modules second class citizens of the kernel, they cannot use
the hotplugging or any of the new device model type code, they are
always going to be second best and more of a problem for users, udev
for binary modules is now probably not possible, if you take Linus's
view that binary modules that are not derived from the kernel are not
necessarily GPL then we've made them not able to be as good as other
kernel modules, I don't think we'll annoy any binary module vendors
we'll just piss off users...
personally I thought the whole _GPL thing was meant to denote
interfaces that showed that code was derived from the kernel so should
be under the GPL, interfaces that all drivers should use to work with
Linux are not IMHO proving the code is derived from the kernel, they
still could be derived from another project but just want to be a 2.6
device driver and use hotplug or sysfs.... so they can without fear
lie about their status to use these interfaces... as Linus has said
previously these interfaces are advisory, only lawyers/judges can
decide if they are enforceable....
Dave.
