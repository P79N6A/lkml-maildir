Hi,Kosaki
Thank you very much .
I have another question about share memory . Assume a process create a share memory , seems the page that the process used can not be discard or swap out when they are no longer used by any process or no swap space .
1.whether the maped page of the share memory is persistent in system until
  system restart ? if not how page frame reclaiming process it ? 
Thanks advanced 
Best Regards.
