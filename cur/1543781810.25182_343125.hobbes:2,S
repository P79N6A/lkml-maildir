Hi,
    I am trying to understand the timer adjustment calculation in 
Linuxkernel 2.6.12.5.
How the time_adj is going to effect the change in HZ.
For example if i modified the HZ to 2000. Then what will hapen to the 
time_adj. is there any separate
calculation of time_adj is required for HZ 2000.
Thanks.
Cjag
