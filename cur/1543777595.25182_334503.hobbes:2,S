chrdev_open() calls tty_open(), which then calls init_dev().  init_dev()
takes tty_sem, does its stuff, and then releases tty_sem.  A little
later on, tty_open() calls the uart driver's uart_open() function.
So it does this with tty_sem unlocked.

The stack traces on x86 are very hap-hazard - the code just scans the
stack for anything which looks like it may be in kernel text and dumps
the result.  This means that stale words on the stack which may have
been return addresses at one time may still look like return addresses.
Don't believe everything you see in an x86 stacktrace!
