futex behaves like most of the other syscalls, i.e. on error returns -1
and sets errno to the error value, like EAGAIN, EFAULT etc.
This is done in a userland wrapper around the syscall, how the kernel tells
userland an error happened and what errno value should be set is an
architecture specific implementation detail.
The man pages in the 2nd section document the behaviour of the userland
wrappers (see e.g. read(2)), not what the kernel actually returns.

glibc doesn't provide a futex(2) function, so at least ATM people can use
#include <sys/syscall.h>
syscall (SYS_futex, &futex, FUTEX_xyz, ...) or come up with their own
assembly to invoke the syscall.
