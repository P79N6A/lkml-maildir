It would be even better to simply have the rule:
 - child gets almost no points at startup
 - but when a parent does a "waitpid()" call and blocks, it will spread 
   out its points to the childred (the "vfork()" blocking is another case 
   that is really the same).
This is a very special kind of "priority inversion" logic: you give higher 
priority to the things you wait for. Not because of holding any locks, but 
simply because a blockign waitpid really is a damn big hint that "ok, the 
child now works for the parent".
