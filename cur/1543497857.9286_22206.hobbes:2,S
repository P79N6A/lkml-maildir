Even that much shouldn't be necessary, as tar can extract individual
files from an archive, so all that's needed is to have a compressed
tarball with all the relevant drivers in it, and have the install
script do something like the following...
 Q> NEEDED=`get-required-driver-list`
 Q> mkdir -p /lib/modules/`uname -r`
 Q> cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`
 Q> tar xzf /dev/initrd $NEEDED
...where `get-required-drivers-list` is whatever is required to list
the drivers needed for a particular install, and /dev/initrd points to
what's currently the initial ramdisk, but which would become a tarball
in this scheme.
Basically, this would replace the initrd with a tarball from which
only those files needed for a particular install would be extracted
into ramdisk, the rest staying in the boot image.
Best wishes from Riley.
