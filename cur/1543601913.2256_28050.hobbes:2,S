Any object (file/directory/symlink) needs an inode. You can either rely
on the generic VFS iget (or iget4) implementation to find previously
allocated inodes, in which case you need to have a read_inode function
which is called whenever an inode is not found and a new one needs to be
initialized. SMBFS is clearly using it's own methods for finding
previously allocated inodes/allocating new ones, as it doesn't have an
read_inode implementation.
Put_inode, delete_inode and clear_inode are all called in different
places when inodes are released or destroyed, and can be used to tear
down FS-private data structures. put_inode is called whenever iput is
called, there might still be other references, so you need to check the
i_count to see how many users there are left. delete_inode is probably
related to deleted files, and clear_inode is only called when an inode
is finally dropped from the inode cache and possibly given off to some
other FS. Coda is able to use clear_inode, because we have a callback
mechanism to invalidate inodes even when they are not in use anymore.
This saves us a few calls to the userspace cachemanager, which are
relatively expensive.

The VFS already does that for us, the only necessary function is an
operation that returns the contents of the symbolic link (e.g.
fs/coda/symlink.c).
btw. there is a linux-fsdevel mailinglist at vger.kernel.org where most
FS hackers hang out. I guess that the #kernelnewbies IRC channel at
irc.openprojects.net is also a goof place for these types of questions
