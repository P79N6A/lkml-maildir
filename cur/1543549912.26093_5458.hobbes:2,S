Right.  I've reproduced this with usb-uhci on 2.4.0-test7 (fails)
and test5 (works) and 2.2.18pre9 (works).  I'm slowly looking for
the reason/problem (along with other things).
I have added this to the USB 2.4 TODO list as CRITICAL.
Please let me know if you make any progress on this and I will
do the same.
Thanks,
~Randy
