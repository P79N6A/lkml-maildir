i only read linux-kernel on the web and as time permits]
It looks to me like your dereference comes from this line:
        if (fl->fl_file != NULL)
                inode = fl->fl_file->f_dentry->d_inode;
and, if my terribly weak x86 assembler isn't deceiving me, f_dentry
is NULL.  Since you can reproduce this at will, could you insert some
debugging for me?
	if (fl->fl_file != NULL) {
		if (fl->fl_file->f_dentry) {
			inode = fl->fl_file->f_dentry->d_inode;
		} else {
			printk(KERN_EMERG "null dentry at %d\n", id);
		}
	}
That will avoid the oops, and tell us who managed to set a file lock on
a file without a dentry.
