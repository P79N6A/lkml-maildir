For the kernel you should fix up too in addition to the printk. Otherwise
you risk a ping of death in the field with some more obscure protocol.
Also the printk should be load limited.

A lot of protocols have variable length headers.  Normally everything
is aligned, but an attacker could purposefully misalign some headers
using variable length padding, causing fields in later headers to be 
misaligned.
e.g. the original reason this was forbidden was because the TCP
option parser could be tricked into reading time stamps unaligned.
That code is now using get_unaligned(), but there are probably
other culprits too (there is a lot of code in the network stack) 
Unfortunately it is hard to test all combinations, so the only safe 
alternative would be to audit source code. Another possibility would be to
use a tainted data scheme similar sparse's __user/__iomem annotations with
a static code checker (or extending sparse), but that would also require a lot 
of work to do properly and add the necessarily annotations.
Also watch out for netfilter modules -- they make all this much more 
complex. And drivers possibly too.

Well behaved peers normally don't generate unaligned headers. But
that doesn't mean it couldn't be exploited by someone malicious.
