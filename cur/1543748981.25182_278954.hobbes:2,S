Subject: [PATCH] aty128fb: do not release unrequested range
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The aty128fb driver in 2.6.10-rc3 tries to release an unrequested
range during driver unload. This results in the following printout on
my Apple G4 Cube:
Trying to free nonexistent resource <00802400-008024ff>
The remedy is simple - do not release the unrequested range.
