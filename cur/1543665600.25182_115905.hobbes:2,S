I don't think so.
IMHO, the "old" kernel (used for loading the suspend image) should
quiesce devices in a pretty "normal" way in the exact same way
kexec does (and using the same code path/driver notifiers). I see
no reason why there should be any kind of dependency between the
"loader" kernel and the "loaded" kernel in this regard.
In fact, I'm considering for PPC to just trash the "loader" kernel
when possible and directly load the suspend image from the bootloader
Ben.
