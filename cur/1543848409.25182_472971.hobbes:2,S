I don't think so.  You must be mis-reading the code.  The only timers used 
in ehci-hcd are a couple of watchdogs; they shouldn't affect the normal 
URB completions which occur within ehci_work(), called by ehci_irq().
What Wolfgang meant was that user processes are subject to unpredictable 
delays from all kinds of sources.
