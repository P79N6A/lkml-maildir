Hi, Tim,
I am no debugfs expert, I hope I can do justice to the comparison.
Debugfs						Netlink/Genetlink
1. Filesystem based - requires creating		Several types of data can
   files for each type of data passed		be multiplexed over one netlink
   down						socket.
2. Hard to determine record format/data		Contains metadata including
						type of data and length
						with each record
3. Notifications are hard			Notifications are very easy
   I think they can be done using inotify	good library support for
						notifications. Data can
						either be broadcast or
						selectively mulitcast
4. Requires several open/read/write/close	A single socket can be
   operations					opened, data from kernel
						space can be multiplexed
						over it.
I don't think I did any justice to the advantages of debugfs. The only
one I can think of is that it uses relayfs. Relayfs is efficient in the
sense that it uses per-cpu buffers.
Anybody else want to take a shot in comparing the two?
