for the most part, yes.

enable PCMCIA under general setup, then in network and char, select the
drivers you want.
upon boot up, run cardmgr.  all cardmgr needs is either incore drivers or
modules (/lib/modules/xxx/ does need to exist for cardmgr regardless), and
make sure /etc/pcmcia/* is setup.

cardmgr needs to be running.
i suggest compiling everything into the kernel except if you have a
particular driver that is problematic.  you simply need to run cardmgr now.
