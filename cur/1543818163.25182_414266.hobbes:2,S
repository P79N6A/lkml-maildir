Hi,
I am trying to create multiple sockets in kernel space and use
'sys_select' call on them for reading data from them whenever it is 
available.
But the problem is  socket structures are returned during creation whereas
sys_selct accepts  a set of socket descriptors ( integers ) as input. Is 
there any
API or macro to convert socket structure to socket desciptor ?
It is easy to use 'select' in user space as socket creation would return a 
socket
descriptor which can be used in either 'select' or 'poll' system calls.
Anyone faced a similar problem? Please suggest on this.
