For the queue approach, I meant the async_submit() to simply add the 
request (cookie, syscall number and params) inside queue, and not trying 
to execute the syscall. Once you're inside schedule, "stuff" has already 
partially happened, and you cannot have the same request re-initiated by a 
different thread.

A per-process thread pool already has things correctly inherited, so we 
don't need to add special "adopt" routines for things like "files" and such.

I'm not advocating threads against fibrils. The use of threads may make 
things easier under certain POVs (less ad-hoc changes into mainline). The 
ideal would be to have a look at both and see Pros&Cons under different 
POVs (performance, code impact, etc..).
