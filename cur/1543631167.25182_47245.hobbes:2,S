Actually, if I pass a bad pointer to memcpy(), and I have a handler for
the SIGSEGV that fixes up the thing, yes, by golly, I _do_ expect memcpy()  
to get the right value.
If it doesn't, then the system is BROKEN.
Face it Pavel, you're WRONG. You're so incredibly wrong that this is not 
worth even discussing. Linux does it right now, and I won't break that 
correct behaviour just because somebody has a incorrect and silly view of 
what is readable.
Face it, copy_to/from_user does the RIGHT THING, and stop whining about 
it.
