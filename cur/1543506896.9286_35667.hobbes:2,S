Hello guys,
Since several months I am reading lot of messages of people looking for new drivers
and features covering new controllers going out on the market.
My feeling is that Linux community is entering a race loosed from the beginning.
I repeat this only my own feeling.
Our company is developing and selling a Radiological Information System (RIS)
handling both data and images. As server we are using Linux since 1996. From
1996 till later 1997 we were showing the users how open and friendly was Linux
compared to other Unix and non-Unix servers. We agreed about setting up several
Linux servers with
different kinds of SCSI, Ethernet and Graphic adapters. Result of that were
lot of troubles with these drivers and hardware, and very heavy remote maintenance.
Now we turned back our strategy: we tested Linux 2.0.xx with some mother boards,
graphics, SCSI, RAID5, DLT, SCSI disks, Ethernet adapters and UPS devices.
When installing a new site, we never go out of such tests, whatever the customer is
saying towards
some other adapter 15 cents cheaper.
Now we have a customer base running with an uptime near of 100% and are able to
prove
very easily how Linux is much more stable and fast than other Unix or non-Unix
servers.
This get me to my basic idea: I feel Linux is being now a fact on the field and a
"standard" no
professional software company could ignore. When looking forward seeing Linux being
number one, I would say that rather to spend time trying to setting up new drivers
and drivers
and drivers for adapters having more and more a short time life, system developers
would rather have
to spent their time improving the drivers of a range of adapters and opening Linux
to application development tools.  We have to recognize this is a field where Linux
has
to become much more strong.
With the wave on the field in favor of Linux, could this approach force hardware
manufacturers to become much more "open" with Linux community. There are still
examples
of companies providing Linux community with necessary hardware technical
specifications
for fast and robust drivers design, receving benefits back from sales generated by
Linux market
