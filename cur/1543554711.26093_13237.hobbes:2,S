Hi all,
Are there any plans to develop kernel sound driver support for the
Cyrix/NatSemi CS5530 chipset?  I noticed PCI and IDE support for this
chipset in the kernel source, but nothing for the sound.  I have a NatSemi
Geode GXLV processor, NatSemi Geode CS5530 chipset, and the AC97 codec that
NatSemi recommends (although I'm sure any one will do).  So I can act as an
alpha/beta/gamma/zappa tester!  :)
Thanks,
   Matthew
