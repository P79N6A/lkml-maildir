In theory it should not happen... And it's working on my laptop for resume
just fine with dyntick on. Can you try it without APIC support? Maybe
that's the differerence again. (I don't have APIC on my laptop)
Also a workaround is to disable dyntick before suspend with:
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/timer/timer0/dyn_tick_state
and then enable it again after resume.
