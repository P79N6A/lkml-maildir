Glibc pid_t is 32 bits on i386:
  typedef int __pid_t; /* Type of process identifications.  */
The IPC stuff is special-cased:
  /* Used in `struct shmid_ds'.  */
  typedef unsigned short int __ipc_pid_t;
I am on for increasing pid_t size simply because 32000 processes may
become a bottleneck on large servers.  The restriction isn't necessary
any more.  `top' will be pretty slow though.
