Hi,
  In my project I have added code in
linux/net/ipv4/ip_input.c file
and build a new kernel.
This fragment of the code sees the SRC IP address of
an incomming TCP connection and decides to accept it
or drop it. 
Is it possible to implement this as a module. So that
i need not reboot the machine so that all incomming
packets are accepted.. (I am kinda new to module
programming..)So I would like to know if it is
possible to implement the code as a module..
Thanks
SUJIT
