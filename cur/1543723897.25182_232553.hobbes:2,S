Yes, I missed sparc64 due to the lack of wake_up_forked_process. Dang.
Well, what used to happen is that wake_up_forked_process would put the
idle task on the runqueue like a regular process, then init_idle would
take it off again.
However after the patch, init_idle simply does all the work itself,
and doesn't have to deal with removal from the runqueue. Now sparc64
uses "kernel_thread" to clone its idle tasks, which *does* put the
process onto the runqueue. init_idle then also makes it the idle task.
This is probably why it blows up.
I guess another small function to remove the task from the runqueue
before calling init_idle for those arches that want it would be the
way to go.
Sorry, this is my fault. Got to run now, but I'll send a patch to try
in a few hours if someone hasn't already.
