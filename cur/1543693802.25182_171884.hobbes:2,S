good news, I tried the patch and the oops no longer occurs.
I also added code to aiocp to check if the AIO reads are completing out
of order, which would cause the AIO writes to out of order.  The reads
are completing in order.  However, I added code to check if the AIO
writes are completing out of order, and, if fact, they do.  Not very
often, but I got 8 i/o where an i/o farther in file completes before
an earlier i/o.
