Exactly.

permission() switches into per-fs code.

Only the capable() check.  Unless of course we make uid/gid checking optional.
Which seems like a very bad idea given the mess even with just the current LSM
hooks.

Umm.  Clean and nicely separated code is a lot of gain.  Making Linux's
access clean instead of a lot more messy is a good think.  Much better than
any feature addition.  (Unless, of course, you get paid for adding
features..)

For the kernel it's a functional behavior.  The administrator can chose
to apply it for security reasons, but that's policy and thus not the
kernel's issue.

Okay, this does actually makes sense.  Point taken.

Yes, a hook without a intree user or at least a properly defined and
available out-of-tree user is pointless.
