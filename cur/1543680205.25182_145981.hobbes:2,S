Not really.
No change on my system.
No fancy gui (just fvwm). Testing is very simple:
In one xterm window make bzImage
in other mplayer /some/movie.avi
... and the movie is jerky :-(
In the weekend i did some experiments with the defines in kernel/sched.c
It seems that changing in MAX_TIMESLICE the "200" to "100" or even "50"
helps a little bit. (i was able to do a make bzImage and watch a movie
without noticing that is a kernel compile in background)
system is AMD DURON chipset via KT/KM 133, Ati Radeon VE.
I remeber with nostalgicaly about the times when i could (with a 2.5
kernel) do a make -j 5 bzImage AND watch a movie in the same time
