HiYa,
i just tried using the sktr drivers with 2.2.3. The card is detected OK,
but ifconfig hangs. It looks like the driver isn't getting any interrupts
from the card. The card worked (sort of) OK with 2.1.108 and at least
opened the adapter with 2.1.12x kernels. 
The driver itself seems to be unchanged since 2.1.108, so was there any
recent change of interrupt handling that could cause this?
Cheers,
Jochen
