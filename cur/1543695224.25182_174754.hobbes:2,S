Intel (x86) mmu allows you to put a page table entry in the linux
upper level table.  Which provides for a page size of 4MB (2MB when
using PAE).  This mechanism is used by the HUGETLB page code in
Linux, which can provide substanstial performance gains by reducing
the number of TLB misses for applications that randomly access large
amounts of memory.
Intel Itanium systems support a boatload of page sizes from 4K to 4G.
