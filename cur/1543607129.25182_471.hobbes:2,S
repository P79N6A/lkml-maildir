The readme for their NVdriver explicitly states "All official stable kernel releases from 2.2.12 and up are supported;
"prerelease" versions such as "2.4.3-pre2" are not supported, nor are
development series kernels such as 2.3.x or 2.5.x."
Appendix B, 
http://www.nvidia.com/docs/lo/1021/SUPP/README.txt
Run a release kernel with thier driver, let them worry about the changes, since they have the linux source, and the kernel developers do not have thiers.
