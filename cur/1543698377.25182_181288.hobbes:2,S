With fsync, can't you write all the dirty pages with that bit set,
write _again_ all the pages in RAM which are clean but which have
never been written with the don't-cache bit, and read-then-write with
the bit set all the pages which are not in RAM but which were dirtied
and written without the don't cache bit set?
I know, it sounds a bit complicated :)
But would it work?
