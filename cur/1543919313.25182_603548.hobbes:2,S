If it does a 'select SECURITY_NETWORK' but NET=n, does the resulting kernel
actually build?  The problem seems to be that select isn't transitive - if
you select something, it won't automagically select that something's pre-reqs
(modulo the recent patches I've seen posted, have those been mainlined?).
