Yes.  I haven't really worked out what's going on in there, but it looks 
like it's losing track of what it has allocated and running out of timer 
MSRs.  Possibly because the CPUs are reinitialized on resume: it "thaws 
the CPUs", which prints the same CPU information as at boot time - caps, 
bogomips, etc - so I presume it actually redoes those things.  I wonder 
if this makes the performance counter reservation loose track of things?
