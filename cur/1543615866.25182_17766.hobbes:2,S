certainly it makes smp simpler agreed, so also ramdisk_updatepage always
runs on locked pages.
the reason it was not locking down the page is that before the
ramdisk_aops was introduced, a read via /dev/ram? would lock down the
pagecache page, and then start the ll_rw_block on the pagecache page,
but with the page locked, so it would deadlock with an unconditional
grab_cache_page. Now with the ramdisk_aops it should be ok because the physical
address space I/O never uses the ->make_request_fn so it shouldn't
recurse on the page lock any longer.

your patch seems all right to me now (of course with ramdisk_updatepage
run unconditionally). (I'd only set -ENOMEM in the fast path, so the
oom branch becomes an out of line goto, didn't checked the asm generated
though)
