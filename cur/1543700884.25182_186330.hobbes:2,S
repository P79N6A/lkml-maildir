   Well it's obviously derived if any of the following is true:
1)You are using any linux you borrowed from gpl sources.
2)The module uses a lot internal kernel hooks.
Linus claims that is it's derived if:
1)It only supports linux.  (He's got a point.)
2)It was originally written for linux. (I'd disagree, but IANAL)
Certainly you'd have a leg to stand on if:
1)The module was really cross platform.  (Extra points for it working on 
*BSD, or the like 1st.)
2)The linux headers are clearly marked gpl.
3)Every accessing internal linux kernel functions was in the linux headers.
4)Everything in the module was gpl, or bsd.  (Less to do things being 
derived than with if you can legally use the result.)
