People get visions of grandeur when HAL is mentioned: they think it'll
abstract everything.  I really only want to do the minimum needed for
the hypervisors we have on the table today.
Maybe one day it will abstract everything, then we can call it a HAL.
But I won't be doing that work 8)

We could patch all the indirect calls into direct calls, but I don't
think it's worth bothering: most simply don't matter.
The implementation ensures that someone can get boot on a new hypervisor
by populating the ops struct.  Later they can go back and implement the
patching stuff.

Each backend wants a different patch, so alternative() doesn't cut it.
We could look at generalizing alternative() I guess, but it works fine
so I didn't want to touch it.
