In that case segment size must be more than 32 bits, or below
transformation will not be correct? segsize is long, but should be u64 I
think.
static void fixup_from_wbuf(struct super_block *sb, struct logfs_area
	*area, void *read, u64 ofs, size_t readlen)
u32 read_start = ofs & (super->s_segsize - 1);
u32 read_end = read_start + readlen;
And this can overflow, since readlen is size_t.
It is wbuf fixup, but I saw that somewhere else.
Although, according to your description, it should be 32bit, sum can be
more than 32 bit.

Stop kiling your kidneys, your health and promote such antisocial style
of life, start drinking vodka instead.
