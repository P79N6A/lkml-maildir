I've seen this problem long before 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 on LKML (e.g. 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0406.2/0040.html
) and on 
different laptop (Dell). So may be, there is a deadlock window somephere 
that just open ups or close depending on :
	- Compiler,
	- Unrelated patches,
	- ...
I guess, hunting will be fun... I would start by the thermal problem as 
it seems to be hit also by a few people... I whish I could have kdb 
integrated to see what happens but on mm tree applying it is too painfull...
