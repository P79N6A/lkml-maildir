Hello, I'm having a bit of trouble getting ATAPI CD-R woring on my RedHat
2.2.14 system. I think I have everything loaded except the sr_mod module
which I can't locate. I have looked everywhere and it doesn't seem to be
present on my machine. Any ideas where I can find it? Any other suggestions.
Thanks,
Brian
