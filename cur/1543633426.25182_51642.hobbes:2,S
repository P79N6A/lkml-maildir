Thanks to Ganda.
In fact, I am implementing RFC3095 to linux kernel.  I want to make it
a kernel module.
The basic function of this module could be described as the following 2
parts:
1. The module will modify the outgoing packet(ipv6 or IPv6 ) and compress
   the IP header.(we will do flow recognition and update some context
   for further compress stuff here.)
2. The other part of this module will de-compress  this compressed
   IP header. And then passes the de-compressed packet up to IP(v4 or v6)
   module to do the normal recieving processes.
To realize the function 1, I use this tricks: I modified all the kernel's
active network device's dev->hard_start_xmit function pointer to be my own
function named as 'my_output_handler', and backuped the original
'dev->hard_start_xmit' funtion pointer witch will be called inside
'my_output_handler' as to send out the modified data.
As to realize function 2, I would like to omitted here.  For it has
nothing to do with this current panic.
All the above funtions are implemented and I tested the codes via my
loopback network device(lo) using the address of '::1' or '127.0.0.1'.
The codes run OK in the lo device.  But when I put my codes to the real
ethernet device which is a realtek 8139 network card, I got kernel panic.
I dont know what to do with it?  I guess this panic is due to something
difference between loopback network device and the real network device
drivers. But I dont know exactly what is wrong, or say, that what should I
do to avoid this panic?  Any rules to write safe code here?
Many thanks again.
Best regards,
Wang.
