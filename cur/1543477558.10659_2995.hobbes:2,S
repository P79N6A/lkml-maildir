I'm still seeing these messages:
    kernel: nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 116
and I'm using the new knfsd-981204 package.  Note that I'm getting
this message as an NFS client only.  Typically I get this message and
a mount fails.  Could this be a problem with am-utils-6.0?  I don't
think I can use autofs unless it can use the NIS map stuff.
