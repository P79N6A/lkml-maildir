I personally couldn't care less about true real-time behavior, but
there is something to be said for some kind of I/O (and memory) priority (set
dynamically) in order to prevent a thrashing monster from making the machine
unuseable.
Problem is, I can't seem to find the cool algorithm that would automatically
notice such a situation and would correctly reduce the resident-set-size and
I/O use of such a monster (or alternatively that would automatically notice
which processes should be provided with a "guaranteed" amount of ram and I/O).
