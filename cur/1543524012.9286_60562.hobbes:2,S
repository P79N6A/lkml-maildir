If I understand correctly from the patents and white papers, most of the
instruction scheduling stuff and even some of the register allocation(?!)
becomes irrelevant with Crusoe. The stuff that's still important is
probably CSE, unrolling, and inlining, not to mention language-specific
stuff like aliasing optimizations. But a lot of the nasty arch-specific
stuff in the compiler gets pushed down to the translation layer..
