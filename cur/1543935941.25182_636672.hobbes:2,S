We can (and should) eliminate it from normal operation at least. The one during
reboot has to be kept unfortunately.

It is, but the resulting code is significantly more efficient and does
various other things in better ways (the explicit list allows various
other optimizations). It's how c_p_a should have been written from day one.

That's mostly orthogonal. Don't know why you bring it up now?
Anyways more efficient c_p_a() makes PAT usage easier.

You could always disable it. Just set full_flush = 1.
Anyways it would be possible to disable it more fully, but at least
the individual flush infrastructure is used by other code too and useful
for it.

Not reliable due to the speculative out of order nature of x86 CPUs. 
See my other mail to Dave explaining one scenario where it can go 
wrong.

MTRRs will not go away, just used less.
One advantage of PAT is that you can set any page in memory efficiently
to WC or UC without requiring hacks like an hardware aperture. But to
make good use of that this operation needs to be reasonably efficient.

That will already happen without my patchkit.  No change to the positive

Once PAT is in people will use it more I expect. And contrary to your
claims it is already used for more than just ioremap. Please grep
for it.
Actually in DEBUG_PAGEALLOC kernels it is currently heavily used,
but I eliminated that.

I would prefer to not reorder it significantly inside itself.
I took pains to make it all in small bisectable steps but redoing
all that would be very painful and time consuming for me. Also currently 
it is relatively logical in the way it builds on each other and dumb separation
in clflush vs no clflush wouldn't help with that.
A merge after PAT is fine for me if PAT happens soon (iirc there were
only minor changes to cpa anyways), although it's a pity to delay
some of the fixes for so long. But I haven't seen an PAT update recently
and at least the original patch needed much more work. So I think
you should only delay it for PAT if that happens soon.
I had actually hoped that CPA would be ready for .25, but I have my doubts
for PAT with that.
One possibility if you're worried about CLFLUSH so much would be to
merge the whole series but keep CLFLUSH disabled.  Don't think it would
improve things much though and the only way to get it shaked out is wider
testing anyways.
