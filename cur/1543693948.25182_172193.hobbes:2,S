That would be a nice trick and works fine for the regular sorted list, but
it would be nasty for the rb-tree handling.
If you really want /proc/PID/maps to look right, add a new vm_area_struct,
see if you can allocate it as part of the "struct mm_struct" so that we
don't get yet another (unnecessary) allocation on fork time. I hate how
fork()  has slowed down due to other issues (mainly rmap).
Being _guaranteed_ to always have a "end marker" on the vma list would 
potentially actually simplify some of the code, but since this would be 
architecture-dependent, it wouldn't help right now. How ugly does the code 
end up being?
