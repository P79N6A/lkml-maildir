In a nutshell: other OS compatibility. Not that I care, but they're 
trying to cater to the users that have both Linux and Windows (and other 
stuff) installed on a RAID-1 created by their BIOS RAID driver. In that 
situation, they can't use logical volumes for the other OS partitions, 
they've got to have an MSDOS partition table on top of the RAID device.
However, that does not mean this needs to be done in the kernel, they 
can easily use a (future) dm-partx that reads the partition table and 
tells DM what devices to make from the RAID device.
