It would be nice if the people who actually needed it would have
select-ed it. That's how I built the list.
Most of the other examples you listed are obviously 64bit... there should be
more occurances, but I guess they've (alpha, for instance) not updated
their defconfig in a dogs age.
Anyway, sorry I didn't notice ARM. I'll add it to the list on the next
round.

(but seriously, this should be select-ed, not just set in a defconfig
 somewhere...)
