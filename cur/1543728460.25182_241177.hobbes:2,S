No
It looks like your select timeouts are too short and when the cpu load 
goes up they repeatedly timeout wasting cpu cycles.
I quote from `man select_tut` under the section SELECT LAW:
1. You should always try use select without a timeout. Your program
  should have nothing to do if there is no  data  available.  Code
  that  depends  on timeouts is not usually portable and difficult
  to debug.
