So You like the idea of stocking structure pointers inside CPU registers
or I missed Your point ?
The proposed implementation is "uniform" between architectures, that's my
point.
What for CPUs that cannot offer "free" registers ?
What if someone else, following the example, start stocking some other
pointer in free registers ?
