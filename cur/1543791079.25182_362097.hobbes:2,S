Take a look at those files, trying not to crack up laughing
at the file format. Maybe you will cry. Imagine that some
apps try to parse those... all of them, repeatedly, while
being tolerant of unspecified future changes.
(remember that a filename may have a colon, new fields
may be added, new lines may differ in unknown ways, etc.)
Could we fix this ASAP? How about just commenting it
out right now, so nothing important starts to rely on it.
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL would do I guess.
I'll gladly do something sane, but not tonight. I'm sorry I
did not catch this earlier; I've been rather sick and I never
imagined that this thing would get accepted without a
major rework of the file format.
