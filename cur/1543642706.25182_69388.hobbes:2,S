So, what you gurus suggest me to do? How can I get physical address of a
user buffer (which was originally mmap'ed() from a kmalloc() allocation) and
which would also be protable across multiple platforms?
Thanks.
Imran.

   That's easy to say until you try and work with it (I assume you have,
   and forgot).  Just try to do a 3G/1G split on it, for example.
Maybe you missed the "64-bit mode" part of what I said. :-)
In 64-bit mode there is no need to do any kind of split.
You just use the KSEG mapping with full cache coherency for
all of physical memory as the PAGE_OFFSET area.
I forget if it was KSEG0 or some other number, but I know it
works.
