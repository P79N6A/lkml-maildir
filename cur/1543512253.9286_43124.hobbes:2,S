	It would appear Solaris at least has some user-space proggie create
/devices, and then another one that creates /dev off of that.  I'm guessing
that it just assigns major,minor's by counting from the beginning to the
end of the devices.  I could be wrong on that, but in any case, it does
appear at least to still use major,minor, which really isn't terribly
scalable.

	One thing Linux is based around to some extent is more the 'general'
case.  Now it's true that often a good solution handles both the general
case and the specific cases, but that is not always the case.  In order to
handle 7.6 million disk drives, each device would have to have around 3
bytes associated with it to give it a unique identifier.  Here you would have
to have it where each device was numbered sequentially, assigning numbers
to the possible number of devices is not exactly practical unless you have
a very large space to draw from, and that seems excessive.
