  Hello.
  After rewrite of umount checks some time ago (just now reading your mail
I realized I never asked) filesystem doesn't umount when quotas are
turned on on it - it fails on check (atomic_read(&mnt->mnt_count) > 2)
in do_umount().
  Is this intended behaviour? If so, we can remove later DQUOT_OFF() call
and maybe make somewhere a note about changed behaviour otherwise we should fix
it...
later failed.
  Maybe we can ask quota (or get it from its structures) how many files it's
using and change the test to reflect this number... Do you agree with this?
					Bye
