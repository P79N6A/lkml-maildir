Hello,
Please forgive me if this is naive.  It seems that you could recompile 
your tar and patch commands to use the POSIX_FADVISE(2) feature with the 
POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE flags.  It seems these would cause the tar and patch 
commands to not clutter the page cache at all.
It'd be nice to be able to make a wrapper out of this kind of like the 
fakeroot(1) command like such as:
nocachesuck tar xvfz kernel.tar.gz
ya know what I mean?
