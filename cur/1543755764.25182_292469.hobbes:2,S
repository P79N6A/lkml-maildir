The ATI kernel modules reportedly use the syscall() facility to call 
modify_ldt, which I guess is not exported... I've received the report of this 
because that causes a name conflict with the SKAS patch I maintain.
Also, I have the doubt is that they're circumventing EXPORT_SYMBOL 
restrictions and thus violating the license. IANAL, however.
