Thanks for the clarification.  It was unfair of me to imply any amount
of "reluctance" to submit the NFS/RDMA code for review.  I was just
trying to gauge the "real soon now" type posts we've seen over the
past few months.  If anything I'd imagine the latest NFS churn has
given you additional incentive to merge.
Thanks for your continued hard work; NFS/RDMA looks to be a huge
improvement for modern NFS deployments.
regards,
Mike
