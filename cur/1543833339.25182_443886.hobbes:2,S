So you mean that when this:
		if (unlikely(!area->pages[i])) {
			/* Successfully allocated i pages, free them in __vunmap() */
			area->nr_pages = i;
			goto fail;
happens, it could be that i <= PAGE_SIZE/sizeof(struct page *) and __vunmap
kfree()s something which it should have vfree()d, yes?
That sounds like a dead box, or worse.
I think the change would be a good one even if it didn't fix a bug, thanks.
