This is kind of odd - I have an Athlon 850 with a sis 730 chipset. X
detects the "sis 630" as my video chipset.
under 2.4.19-pre4-ac3 all is good - reboot to 2.4.19-pre4-ac4 and gdm
won't start.
X does start successfully.. but not gdm. I can go to runlevel 3 and
run startx without a problem (i.e. get a window manager, etc..)
If I boot back to 2.4.19-pre4-ac3 all is well again.
/var/log/gdm/:0.log complains of a lock
-----
Fatal server error:
Server is already active for display 0
        If this server is no longer running, remove /tmp/.X0-lock
        and start again.
When reporting a problem related to a server crash, please send
the full server output, not just the last messages.
Please report problems to xfree86@xfree86.org.
-----
However clearing the lock (and making sure its gone when the sever
starts) is of no help.
