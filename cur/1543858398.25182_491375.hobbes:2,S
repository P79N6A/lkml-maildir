Is this a problem?
You can exit a menu by selecting <Exit> and pressing Enter
or (as the help text at the top of the screen says:)
pressing <Esc><Esc> (2 times).  Yes, pressing <Esc> one time
and then waiting for 1-2 seconds used to exit a menu.
One could argue that it has been "fixed" to match the help text.
