Hehe, hey, its not MY routers/sites that are broken. Look at it this way ...
Microsoft must have figured out that there were some broken nets out there
and that setting a default TTL of 128 made their stuff work.  I also noticed
that setting my TTL to 128 made my stuff work.  I am not in any kind of
crusade to make people do "the right thing". I am simply trying to make my
site work with the maximum number of possible clients.
I really do not care WHY it works, all I care is that it DOES work. I am not
the least bit interested given the current economy of things to try to bully
people into doing what is right. I am more interested in operating with the
client population that is out there without having to make them change
anything.
