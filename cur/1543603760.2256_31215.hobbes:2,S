I used a test program with an endless dummy=new char[1024] loop.
This program triggered the allocation failure with 2.4.10 but with 2.4.11pre4 
this program is killed by the OOM-Killer and not by the VM.
Bytheway,I had this problem without highmem - only 512 MB, and  my problem is 
gone with 2.4.11pre4. 
At least this bug is solved. There is nothing more I wanted to report.
Good work :-)
