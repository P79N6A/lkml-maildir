I'm seeing the same lockups, but this is on the following:
Dell Poweredge 6350  (2x450 Xeon)
256MB ECC
Perc/2 (AMI) Ultra2 RAID 27GB
Adaptec 2940 on-board (DDS-3 tape drive only)
Intel EEPro  (100Mb into a Catalyst Switch)
Redhat 5.2
No IDE devices (or IDE driver compiled in the kernel)
This machine handles an average of about 110-130 simultaneous
interactive users during weekdays along with a myriad of POP/IMAP users
with about 70,000 emails/day traffic flow.
It has been 100% stable on kernel releases 2.0.<12 for 8 months, but
crashes in less than 24 hours on both 2.2.12 and 2.2.13pre with no errors
logged and a dead MAGIC_SYSRQ.
Kernels are stock with the exception of NR_TASKS being bumped up to 2000
(this is true of all the past/current 2.2 kernels on this machine) and the
usual runtime upping of file-max/inode-max to 32768 in rc.local.
Attached is a copy of my .config for reference if needed.
