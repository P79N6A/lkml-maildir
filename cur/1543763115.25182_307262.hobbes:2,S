Looks like we have basically the same device.

This would be remotely possible but I would discount it being probable.  You 
see, a drive requires the most power at spin up.  This thing spins up just 
fine regardless of what port I have it plugged into.  On top of that, the USB 
card has a power adaptor already (plugs into the laptop's USB port) that I 
always use.
Besides, how would I connect an external power supply to this?  No connector 
on the drive assembly...
