At this point there's no technical need to kill it - it's a zero-overhead 
thing tucked away into a single .c module in arch/x86/kernel/numaq_32.c. I 
even consolidated most of its headers in that file, to reduce its cross 
section.
That was the main point of the restructuring i did - subarchitectures were 
causing ongoing maintenance overhead before. That overhead is practically 
zero now.
So two days ago it might have made some sense to rip out this code - now 
there's no pressing need really. We can remove it in a few years once the 
last beep has been received from those platforms. The numaq code is now 
quite similar to an old driver in drivers/* - there's no real downside 
from having it around.
