i've seen the same problem on a quad Dell PE6300 running stock 2.2.9 (no
quotas, egcs-built, AIC7xxx SCSI driver). the machine hangs solid.  i
haven't had a chance to poke around to see what's up; we just started
seeing these a few days ago, and it's a test machine.
having a nice integrated kernel debugger like SGI's kdb would be great
to resolve problems like these.  the patch to dump an oops to a floppy is
also good, but would it be possible to dump it to a file or a small
partition on an internal disk instead?  Linus, including a feature like
that would make it a whole lot easier to get high quality oops reports to
developers.
