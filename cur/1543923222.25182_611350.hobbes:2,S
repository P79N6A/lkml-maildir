It's a benefit IFF multiple devices are spread across more than one guest
_and_ we don't trust every particating guest to play nicely with IO.  That way
the Hypervisor can assign one device to a specific guest OS for direct access.
E.g. 4 port Gige card could directly support the host and 3 guests with somewhat
lower risk of tromping on each other's MMIO space.
If Xen is cooperative, this seems a bit paranoid. I don't recall ever seeing a
driver bug where the driver accidentally poked MMIO space at the wrong device.
That's much more common for IO Port space. The only exception was xfree86 where it
poked around in random places to deal with buggy HW quirks.
The use of an IOMMU will provide much more useful protection.
