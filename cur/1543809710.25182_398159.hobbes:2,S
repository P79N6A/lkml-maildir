Think we're talking about different things. preempt_count is not statistical
stuff. Actually if you have preempt_count != 0 preemption is disabled.
At least on s390 we didn't set this counter to 0 in case of cpu hotplug thus
ending with a preempt_count > 0 if a cpu gets reenabled. Which gives us a lot
of warnings ala "scheduling while atomic: swapper/0x00000001/0".
So this is not a restriction that should be documented somewhere but a bug.
No idea how powerpc deals with this and if there is the same issue. Just
tried to give a hint since cpu hotplug code for powerpc and s390 looks quite
the same.
