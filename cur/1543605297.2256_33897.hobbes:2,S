Discarding data is an important operation -- in zisofs that can happen
on a page lock conflict; I just use a dummy page for that.

The big issue is memory management.  I *think* the memory policy I
implemented in inflate_fs would work for PPP (you have to provide a
memory area of sufficient size, about 40K, at the time you open a
stream.  In the case of PPP this could probably just be vmalloc()'d at
the time the interface is created.  In the fs case, this is not
acceptable; rather, the filesystem in question has to maintain a
preallocation of memory and mutex it properly.)
