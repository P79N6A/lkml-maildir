No. That won't make any difference. The kernel never talks to the
mountd.
It's being handed a bogus filehandle by the userland mount command
(which gets it from mountd). When it sends the initial NFSv3 GETATTR
call to the nfsd, and gets rejected, it just retries the same GETATTR
call as an NFSv2 call.

I'll check what's happening. AFAICS, the NFS layer should not really
care, but it will pass some funny values back to the VFS, and this
might be screwing something up...
