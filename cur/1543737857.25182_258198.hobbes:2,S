In the spot where this occurs, it adds both CCS_BASE and
'rcsindex' to the sram base, and only when rcsindex >= NUMBER_OF_CCS.
NUMBER_OF_CCS is 64, and the difference between CCS_BASE and RCS_BASE
is 0x400 so this really doesn't account for anything.
I can't see how you've changed the behavior, so it should work as well
as it did before your changes.
Sorry, I don't have a ray_cs handy :)
