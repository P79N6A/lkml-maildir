Dear all,
We are pleased to announce releasing the new function,
Disk Allocation Viewer (a.k.a. dav).
---
The development of this program is partly supported by IPA
(Information-Technology Promotion Agency, Japan).
---
dav is a program which collects and visualizes the fragmentation
status information of Linux filesystem, ext2/ext3. dav can collect
the fragmentation status information regardless of whether
filesystem is mounted, and can output its text data or visualize it.
Please use this tool and give us some comment.
The following software is necessary for the compilation and the
execution of dav.
 - Linux kernel v2.4 / v2.6
 - GTK+1.2
---
dav binaries, source code and documents are
available in the following site,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/davtools/
http://sourceforge.jp/projects/dav/
We prepared a mailing list written below in order to let users know
update of dav.

And if you have any comments, please send to the above list, or to
another mailing-list written below.
