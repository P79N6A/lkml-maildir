It only has its lock prefixes twiggled, which should be ok.

Are we reading the same source? sched_clock has never used get_cycles_sync(),
just ordinary get_cycles() which is not patched. In fact it mostly
used rdtscll() directly.
The main problem is alternative() nopify, e.g. for prefetches which
could hide in every list_for_each; but from a quick look the current
early NMI code doesn't do that.

That's only for cross modifying code, no?

They are probably both.
I guess we could disable them again. I will cook up a patch.

Patch above would take care of it.

Not sure I see your point here. How can arguments race?

The x86 architecture doesn't require alignment for atomic updates.

Umm, that's far too complicated. Nobody will understand it anyways.
I'll cook up something simpler.
