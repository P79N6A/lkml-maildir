I know you must have a good reason to switch to the 'pack' form in the git tree, but I'm curious. I 
did a git pull late yesterday, which was "normal", and another this morning when I saw that 
2.6.16-rc2 was posted. I was quite surprised to download 110 MB of data to get roughly 150 changed 
lines.
