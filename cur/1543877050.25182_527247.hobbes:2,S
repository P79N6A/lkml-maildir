Before we (and everyone else!) gets lost in this thread, let me say somethings 
upfront:
- From my understanding, task_struct is considered very pristine and any
  changes to it will need to have a good reason, from performance
  and/or memory footprint pov.
  Coming from that understanding, my main intention of doing the rcfs patch was 
  to see if it makes technical sense in reusing the nsproxy pointer in 
  task_struct for task-group based resource management purpose. 
  The experience I have gained so far doing rcfs leads me to think that it is
  technically possible to reuse tsk->nsproxy for both task-group based
  resource management purpose, w/o breaking its existing user : containers
  (although rcfs patches that I have posted may not be the best way to
  exploit/reuse nsproxy pointer).
- If reusing nsproxy may not be a bad idea and is technically feasible
  for use in res mgmt, even if later down the lane, then IMHO it deserves some 
  attention right at the begining, because it is so centric to task-grouping 
  function and because we haven't merged anything yet.
That said, now onto some replies :)

Very true. That's a bug and can be rectified. Atm however in my patch
stack, I have dropped this whole find_nsproxy() and instead create a new 
nsproxy whenever tasks move ..Not the best I agree on long run.

This is rectified in my latest stack. I do a rcfs_task_count() [same
routine which is used in rcfs_tasks_open] to count tasks sharing a
resource object attached to the task_proxy. Not the most optimal solution,
but works and is probably ok if we consider rmdir to be infrequent
operation. If we have a 'struct container' or some object to have shared
state, as you mentioned in a diff thread, in addition to just reusing
nsproxy, it can be made more optimal than that.

Isnt that handled already by the patch in rcfs_common_file_write()?
       mutex_lock(&manage_mutex);
       ns = __d_ns(file->f_dentry);
       if (!atomic_read(&ns->count)) {
               retval = -ENODEV;
               goto out2;
       }

Firstly, this is not a unique problem introduced by using ->nsproxy.
Secondly we have discussed this to some extent before 
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/13/122
). Essentially if we see zero tasks
sharing a resource object pointed to by ->nsproxy, then we can't be
racing with a function like bc_file_charge(), which simplifies the
problem quite a bit. In other words, seeing zero tasks in xxx_rmdir()
after taking manage_mutex is permission to kill nsproxy and associated
objects. Correct me if I am wrong here.

Again note that I am not hell-bent on avoiding a container-like object
to store shared state of a group.  My main desire was to avoid additional 
pointer in task_struct and reuse nsproxy if possible. If the grand scheme of 
things requires a 'struct container' object in addition to reusing ->nsproxy, 
to store shared state like 'notify_on_release', 'hierarchical information' 
then I have absolutely no objection.
Having said that, I don't know if there is practical use for what you
describe above.

Why would it mean duplicating code? A generic function which takes a
dentry pointer and returns its vfs path will avoid this code
duplication?

I think the null grouping as defined so far is very fuzzy ..How would
the kernel use this grouping, which would require reserving N pointers 
in 'struct container_group'/'struct nsproxy'?
