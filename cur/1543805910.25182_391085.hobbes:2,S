I am not supprised that the earlier patch doesn't help your
test. Once you reach the high watermark, the "desperation mode"
latency can be fairly bad since the RCU batch size is pretty
big.
How about trying out the patch included below ? It doesn't reduce
amount of work done from softirq context, but decreases the
*number of RCUs* generated during rt_run_flush() by using
one RCU per hash chain. Can you check if this makes any
difference ?
Thanks
Dipankar
Reduce the number of RCU callbacks by flushing one hash chain
at a time. This is intended to reduce RCU overhead during
frequent flushing.
