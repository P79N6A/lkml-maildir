ugh. Something really weird happened with this e1000 problem.
i crashed the laptop in a weird way and had to power-cycle it in an 
unusual fashion. After that i wanted to try your latest BUG_ON() theory 
but the network hang went away!
For 3 hours i tried to reproduce the hang (i went back to the original 
git tree and the .config under which i found it, i power cycled it 
again, i unplugged the power cord to make it go off battery, unplugged 
the ethernet, recreated a completely new tree, etc. etc.) but with no 
success! Total Heisenbug - and the really annoying thing is that you 
just had a good theory about what might be happening. I'm now at kernel 
build iteration #75 in this tree ...
maybe it's not the power-cycling that somehow brought the e1000 out of 
its weird state but the ethtool ops (and the related firmware readouts, 
etc.)?
(i have your BUG_ON() applied (as a WARN_ON()), but it doesnt trigger. 
Not that this means anything under these circumstances ...)
