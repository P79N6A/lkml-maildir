	linux-2.4.14-pre8 did not compile either if rd.o or loop.o
were compiled as modules, but the names were changed to protect the
guilty (different symbol name, one that wasn't exported).
	Maybe there should have been another -pre.  But the only reason
I was staying on top of the -pre kernels was because I had several major
changes in there, this time around.

	-pre7 actually did compile.  -pre8 did not (not without adding
a line to ksyms.c).
