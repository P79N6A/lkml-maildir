I've seen something similar with USB memory stick devices... they don't
seem to report a media change in a way that the VFS layer will understand.
I think this deserves some _serious_ debugging, personally, as this is
going to come back to haunt us over and over again with some types of
memory stick (and possibly other) media devices.
I'd do it, but I don't have a memory stick reader.  Rogier, can you
volunteer some time for this?
