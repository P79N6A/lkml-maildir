Subject: 2.3.99-pre3-8 -- Even though ISAPNP is enabled, I have no /proc/isapnp  file.

I have been testing a modified cs4232.c from Christoph
Hellwig who is implementing PNP support for more sound
drivers.  He has written:
	Regarding the missing of /proc/isapnp on your 
	computer, you _should_ have /proc/isapnp, 
	even if the kernel does not recognize you pnp
	hardware. Bye the way, does your bios recognize 
	the chip as pnp?
My dmesg output includes:
Mar 23 22:44:46 spot kernel: isapnp: Scanning for Pnp cards... 
Mar 23 22:44:46 spot kernel: isapnp: No Plug & Play device found 
Here are my configuration options for PNP and Sound:
	CONFIG_PNP=y
	CONFIG_ISAPNP=y
	CONFIG_SOUND=m
	CONFIG_SOUND_OSS=m
	CONFIG_SOUND_CS4232=m
	CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812=m
So my questions (which are all basically one question) are: 
1) why would my cs4232 not get recognized as a PNP device?
2) Have I done something wrong that is preventing the
	/proc/isapnp file from being generated?
3) Is there something I need to do to get the cs4232 
	working as a PNP device?
