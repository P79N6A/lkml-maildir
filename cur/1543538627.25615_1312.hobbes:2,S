Sorry, I wasn't talking about 2.4 or any else version. This is just
a problem which should be solved because nobody goes to RTLinux.
I'm waiting not only for the low-latency patch, but also for prioriticed
disks (filesystem?) so that audio/video application gets quaranteed bandwidth,
and also soft-RT support to XFree so that signal level meters and key
presses, for example, can get higher priority than any other X operation.

The low-latency patch already worked in the main Linux. I were expecting
we are going to the same direction and not trying to get any "okay, here
is *this* patch for you, are you __happy__ now?!" compromize.
 -*-
So, I'm not truelly looking for a quick solution as a simple patch.
More I would like solution in which kernel can be changed at run-time
similarly as scheduling policy is changed --- Ingo's patch changes
the kernel (and all its performances) for all which I find bad.
Since putting simple if's to the extra scheduling points is simply not
a good idea, would it give an opportunity to make larger parts of the
kernel changeable: a kernel section specially designed for audio/video
use.
Is there any webpage summarizing the other suggested solutions?
It was mentioned about some long-term solutions...

Juhana
