I have a bug to report. Here it is:
Gary =)
[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
	Complete machine lockup when trying to dd a CD image to a local
	hard drive.
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
	When using the command `dd if=/dev/cdrom of=local/images/image.iso`
	within my home directory, the machine locked up. X was still
	displayed, but unresponsive. Virtual consoles not working,
	couldn't telnet into machine (over ethernet) or even ping it.
	Even the magic sysrq key didn't work (tried to sync/umount the
	drives).
	When issuing the command from a virtual console, the message:
	`hdb: Timeout waiting for DMA' is displayed as the machine locks.
	I managed to get identical crashes about six times, all just after
	a reboot.
	I am able to mount and read this particular CD, and have
	done inbetween crashes. After mounting and umounting the CD, I 
	was able to dd the image from it. I have dd'd images from
	different CD's before (on the same kernel and hardware). However,
	I managed to get the same crash by mounting the CD.
	All these actions were performed under a user account (not root).
	My home directory is mounted over NFS from another Linux box;
	the directory `local' in my home directory is a symlink to a
	partition on my local hard drive.
	The CDROM is a Toshiba IDE drive, as slave. It is the only ide
	device in the system.
