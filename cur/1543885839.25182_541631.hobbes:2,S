 This is a resend, with a better title and slightly more
clarification.  Originally sent yesterday evening, but I can see no
evidence that it got beyond my isp's mailserver.  Apologies to the
Cc's if you did get the original.
 Using Linus' tree pulled on Sunday afternoon UK time.  Running an
amd64 ('pure64') desktop using gdm for graphical login, on Xorg 7.2
with a radeon 9200se.  No problems until I log out of the desktop
and go back to gdm.  Before that, the text consoles seem to be
working fine.  After I go back to gdm. the display is corrupted and
only MagicSysRQ works.  Mostly, the keyboard LEDs flash, but the
only thing that made it to the logs was this exceedingly incomplete
oops report:

 After trying git-bisect, it tells me:

    [PATCH] x86: __pa and __pa_symbol address space separation
    Currently __pa_symbol is for use with symbols in the kernel
address
    map and __pa is for use with pointers into the physical memory
map.
    But the code is implemented so you can usually interchange the
two.
    __pa which is much more common can be implemented much more
cheaply
    if it is it doesn't have to worry about any other kernel address
    spaces.  This is especially true with a relocatable kernel as
    __pa_symbol needs to peform an extra variable read to resolve
    the address.
 [snip the rest of the commit message on the resend]
This time, I'll gzip the config in case it was a size problem for
the list.
