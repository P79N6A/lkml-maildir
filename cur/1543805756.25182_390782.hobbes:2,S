Dear Intended partner, 
On behalf of China HuaMao Arts & Crafts  Organisation, its our pleasure to  introduce to you 
our new sales/marketing  initiative as we are world leading producer  and export of artificial 
arts and  crafts.  The company maintains a comprehensive  database of inter-national trade in  
artificial arts and  crafts, we export into   Canada/America and some parts of Europe. 
We are suffering for genuine and honest  agents who are capable of sales and  marketing of our 
goods and services in what  ever location they are. 
Our motive is to start off from collections  of outstanding accounts owed by various  customers 
willing to make out payments now  after which  agents shall be promoted to  sales/marketing 
section of this programme  based on their  credibilities/accountabilities of accounts  
collected/retrieved. 
Please if you are interested reply by email with  your phone/fax  number and your full contact  
addresses and note,there is no obligation  whatsoever. 
A remuneration can be worked out for your  services as our overseas representative. We  
anticipate your earliest response in this  regard.
