this facility found a handful of real bugs already - Joerg, do you have 
more specifics about that?
Also, such a facility would be useful during driver development, when such 
bugs occur en masse. Faster driver development under Linux is certainly 
desirable.
This facility basically adds a sandbox to all DMA ops and tracks the 
lifetime and validity of DMA operations. Given how ugly DMA bugs can be in 
practice and how hard to debug they are, i see this as good step forward.
