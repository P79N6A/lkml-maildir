No, I haven't seen gcc warn about anything that crazy (ie where it can
see the format string and prove it's safe).
I do see warnings from the Ubuntu gcc with code like:
#include <stdio.h>
extern char *a;
void foo()
{
	printf(a);
}
which produces
a.c: In function 'foo':
a.c:7: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments
The kernel has such code eg in init/main.c, which does
	printk(linux_banner);
when linux_banner is only visible to the compiler as
extern const char linux_banner[];
however the trivial fix
diff --git a/init/main.c b/init/main.c
index 7e117a2..e471598 100644
--- a/init/main.c
+++ b/init/main.c

 	setup_arch(&command_line);
 	mm_init_owner(&init_mm, &init_task);
 	setup_command_line(command_line);
doesn't seem that appealing, since it bloats the object code for a
non-bug -- 7 bytes for me on x86_64:
add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 1/0 up/down: 7/0 (7)
function                                     old     new   delta
start_kernel                                 680     687      +7
given the number of such warnings I see in a typical compile, this would
be a fairly hefty amount of bloat just to shut up gcc.
On the other hand, gcc warning on such code (untrusted format string
passed into a printf-like function) seems quite legitimate as well.
So I dunno.
