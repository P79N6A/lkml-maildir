That documentation has been in the kernel tree for almost a full year:
	commit c18f6365fdbaf30611a8822afcd7097865dcaa32
	Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

	    [PATCH] Add kernel<->userspace ABI stability documentation
And Kay and I have been saying to not to rely on directories for over
two years now...
Anyway, yes, older code should still "just work" if you enable the
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED config option in the kernel, that is what it is
there for.
If you have any problems with that option enabled, please let me know
and I will be glad to fix it up.
thanks,
