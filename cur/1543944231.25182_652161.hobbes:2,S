It is a good idea to remove supers from other filesystems.  I also need to add 
zeroing at the end of the device as well.
Looks like I misread the e2fs zeroing code.  It zeros the whole external log 
device, and I assumed it also zero'd out the start of the main FS.
So, if Btrfs starts zeroing at 1k, will that be acceptable for you?
