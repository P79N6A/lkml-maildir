If -rc's were additive, I would probably use them.  But they are not :(

Yes, that did the trick, although it screws-up concurrent console access.
What is surprising though, is that SOFT_SCROLLBACK is supposed to slow the 
console down.  It actually looks that it speeds things up, albeit at higher 
CPU cost, by buffering screen updates.
This maybe hardware related.  This machine has an onboard VIA/S3 UniChrome 
chip, so I am thinking the CPU is dumping too fast for the chip to sync.

Hangs again.

VIA has a separate driver, couldn't this be merged with mainline?
Thanks!
