If you found any CDMA PCCARD working for Linux, please also let me know,
I am looking for a replacement myself. If you wait a few weeks later, I
get a Ubuntu 6.04 live CD from my Beijing office and then I'll let you
know if this product really work on older kernel.
For your information, BORA 5188 USB is what my friend's using. It works
fine on Ubuntu latest kernel:

Unfortunately she took the last one available on taobao.com, thus I
cannot buy one myself.
Meanwhile it's my wish to call attention on support of EC321 card in
kernel list, because, as you are probably in China, you know, it's too
popular device.
