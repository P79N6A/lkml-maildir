The standard trick is to start with media-change not supported, and
enable it if you get the first change signal.
There are really old floppies that don't support media-change signals,
and they _never_ send it. If you see a media-change signal, then you
know that the floppy is not broken.
Probably a timer (2 seconds) and a delayed cache flush should fix the
problem.
If the device supports media-change and media-lock, then it could
increase the timeout value.
