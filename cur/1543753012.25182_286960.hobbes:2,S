These are things we should fix. They are bugs. Since there is no 2.7
plan pick a date to fix it. We should certainly error the overflow case
*now* because the behaviour is undefined/broken. The other cases I'm not
clear about. setitimer() is a library interface and it can do the basic
checking and error if it wants to be strictly posixly compliant.
