Hi,
I have serious troubles with the 2.2.x kernels in combination of
serial I/O and disk (write) access:
If I transfer a file on a nullmodem connection between a notebook and
my linux machine via zmodem in minicom every 3 seconds or so I get CRC
errors and my disk make funny noises like a reset or a recalibration.
During first tests with DMA enabled, the IDE interfaces were reseted
(kernel log) and (more often!) errors in the disk format were
produced, that some sectors cannot be access and even formatted any
longer!
The problems can be reduced but not removed, if I 
- use irqtune (only the CRC-errors during transfer vanish)
- use less than 115k (the rate of errors are reduced)
If I use a 2.0.x kernel, none of the problems arise.
Moreover, what is really funny, while Linux is active I *hear* every
serial interrupt -- not on a speaker but in the machine itself!
None of the problems arise under a different OS.
Can anybody help me?
My Hardware: AMD233K6, VIA VPX Motherboard, 64M RAM, SEGATE/IBM EIDE
disks.
Regards,
Jens Krinke
