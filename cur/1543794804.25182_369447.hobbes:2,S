Design should be just as ZFS alledgedly does it.  Store the checksum
near the indirect block pointers.  Seeks for checksums basically don't
exist, as you need to seek for the indirect block pointers anyway.
Only drawback is the effective growth of the area for the
pointers+checksum blocks, which has a small impact on your caches.
