Okay. I got rid of rwhod. It sends a query to broadcast which results in
a storm from the 10.x.x.x M$Garbage machines. It apprears that this
storm is the culprit.
I have restarted the network a few thousand times with a shell-script
doing :
	ifconfig eth0 down
	kill -TERM -1
	sh /etc/rd.d/rc.inet1
	sh /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2
	... and the M$Garbage machines that were having trouble didn't
croak.
