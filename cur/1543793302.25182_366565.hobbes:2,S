It's probably not needed. At least AMD K7/K8 has a SYSCFG MSR bit to
do this (or rather they disable bus cycles for locks that makes them
very cheap) Intel has one too in a different MSR that looks similar.
With some luck they're even already set by the BIOS on UP systems.  I
know they are on some AMD systems.
But overall the feature doesn't help longer term because single
threaded CPUs are on their way out.
