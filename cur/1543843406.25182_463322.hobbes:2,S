Could be. But I am still somehow puzzled, since neither of the 
previous versions (F04 & F06 in my case) contain any reference to the 
mentioned methods (_PSS & _PCT). But those versions were speedsteping just 
fine. 
Or maybe I don't know how to look.
Could You dump your "working" ACPI table and look for those two methods?
Regretfully I don't know much about the ACPI and ASL. It seems like a 
perfect occasion to get myself familiar with it.

Btw, that another OS is speedsteping just fine (or pretends doing so).

But of course. I suspect, that aside from the physical layout it is 
basically the same hardware.
