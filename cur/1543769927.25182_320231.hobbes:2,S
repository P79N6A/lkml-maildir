couldn't you just have your multiple 'trees' use the same object 
repository directory (still a single group of files to push), but still 
have your trees with different names? it would be just a little more then 
the copy of the HEAD object (you'd have to change the name in it), but it 
should be easily scriptable)
or is there a limit in git that I'm overlooking that would prohibit this?
