Perhaps the fix which was released in 2.6.19 is relevant. As always, you
can get it as part of my patchkits too which are currently available for
2.6.16.x and 2.6.18(.x). I had also patchkits for 2.6.1[457].x which I
could revive on request. If need be, I would also try to assist
distributors to identify and backport specific fixes. I am currently
wondering if I should take the time to pick out a collection of fixes
for Adrian's 2.6.16.x series.

The ieee1394 core currently dependends on the PCI subsystem for no
obvious reason. The fix probably consists mostly of a rather trivial
conversion from the PCI DMA mapping API to generic DMA mapping. I
actually intend to do this conversion RSN.
Another question is whether the stack-internal APIs are really fit for
non-OHCI chips. There is an unfinished low-level driver for GP2Lynx
which worked to some degree at some point, but other than that I don't
remember positive or negative reports in this department. Maybe proper
documentation of the stack-internal APIs would already help embedded
developers a lot. Furthermore, there may be question marks WRT
interaction of the FireWire stack with architecture specific kernel code.
But back to the subject matter: Clearly, Kristian concentrates on
PCI/OHCI-1394 hardware at the moment. If embedded developers have
specific requirements on the FireWire stack's design, they should IMO
contribute with a list of requirements or maybe even with patches.
