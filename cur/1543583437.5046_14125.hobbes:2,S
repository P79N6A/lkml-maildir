Subject: Re: [PATCH] smaller parport_pc for non-PCI boxes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/3/1/36

Forgot to mention that the patch also fixes the warning: 
	`parport_pc_superio_info' defined but not used
for non-PCI, which was the original reason why I was poking around in there.
Paul.
