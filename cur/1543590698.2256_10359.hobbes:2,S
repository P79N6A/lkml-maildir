  I see you've got 1.2GBytes, so are using HIGHMEM support?
  I sumbitted a patch a few weeks back, against the buffer cache, which
makes it behave better with HIGHMEM.  The patch improved the time take to
create large filesystems.
  This got picked up by Alan in his -ac series.  Can't remember exactly
when Alan merged it, but it is definitely in 2.4.4-ac3.  I'd recommend
giving it a try.
