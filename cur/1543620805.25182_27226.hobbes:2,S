if [ "$CONFIG_SOUND_OSS" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_SOUND_OSS" = "m" ]; then
    bool '      Verbose initialisation' CONFIG_SOUND_TRACEINIT
    bool '      Persistent DMA buffers' CONFIG_SOUND_DMAP
The YMFPCI option was in the body of the above if statement, so I had
to move it out of there to be able to enable it without enabling 
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS.  I hope this is what you meant.

To what granularity?  I use the hardware as a rule of thumb: if the
the hardware supported is fixed, then I put it in the kernel.
Should I compile everything as modules?
However, I did hear something about everything being a module in 2.6
because the kernel will eventually use initramfs or something...
Anyway, this is a different thread.  But I would like to hear your rule 
of thumb for when you compile things as a module...

I kill it but make oldconfig enables it right back :).
I'll look through Config.in in a bit.
