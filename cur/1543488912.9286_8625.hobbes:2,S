The patch is available at the following URL:
ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/misc-stuff/ncr-8xx-896-bundle-0.1-for-linux-2.2.3-pre1.patch.gz
It consists in the following:
Added files in linux/drivers/scsi: (basically the sym53c8xx driver)
- linux/drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx.h
- linux/drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx.c
- linux/drivers/scsi/ChangeLog.sym53c8xx
Modified files in linux/drivers/scsi:
- README.ncr53c8xx       talk about the 896 driver
- Config.in              allows to select the 896 driver instead of 
                         the generic 8xx one.
- ncr53c8xx.h            includes sym53c8xx.h to avoid too much  
                         duplicates.
- ncr53c8xx.c            contains some fixes against 3.1f version I sent 
                         Linus this morning.
- ChangeLog.ncr53c8xx    contains comments on the fixes.
- Makefile               compile the selected driver source.
                         (ncr53c8xx.c or sym53c8xx.c)
Other file that has been modified:
- linux/Documentation/Configure.help
For now, all the doc patterns I have added are probably not in good enough
english for the kernel mainstream, but you may want to look into the patch
and let me know if I didn't do neither wrote some too wrong or to bad
things. And if you have time for giving the patch a shot and let me know
if it is reasonnable or not, this can also help me. 
Thanks, in advance for testing this patch,
   Gérard.
