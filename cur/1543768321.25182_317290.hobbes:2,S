The interaction of aliases and install commands on the same thing is
deliberately undefined (eg. "alias foo bar // install foo ..." - which
takes priority?), but aliases that lead to install commands like this is
OK.  If not, it's a bug.
The other possible solution is for /etc/hotplug.d/blacklist to contain
"install xxx /bin/false // install yyy /bin/true //
include /etc/modprobe.d" and have hotplug invoke modprobe with
--config=/etc/hotplug.d/blacklist.  Substitute names to fit.
Now, should install commands in included files override install commands
in earlier files?  Again, undefined, but currently they do: in the above
model maybe they shouldn't?  We can nail it down either way...
Thanks,
Rusty.
