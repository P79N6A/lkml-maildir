Subject: Who uses hdx=bswap or hdx=swapdata?

Is the hdx=bswap or hdx=swapdata option actually in use?
When is it needed?
The current implementation can cause data corruptions on SMP with PIO 
transfers:
It modifies the source buffer during disk writes, and these temporary
modifications (within the irq handler) are visible with mmap on SMP.
Is it possible to remove the option entirely, or should it be fixed?
