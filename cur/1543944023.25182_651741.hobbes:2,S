Hello,
it seems 2.6.25-rc1 is out and mmiotrace did not make it. Thank you all
for your feedback.
Ingo, you can throw away all my patches. I will start from scratch and
come back when I have made mmiotrace built-in-able and got rid of the
page fault hook. It should make a nicer patch set as a whole.
