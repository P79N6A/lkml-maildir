I don't know how much may apply to other systems.

Damn it! The name appears to have changed between 2.2 and 2.3.
In pci.h the struct in 2.2.13 (and I would assume later) had
    unsigned long base_address[6]
which cooresponded to the various PCI Base Address Registers.
Looking in the 2.3.24, I see that the name has changed. I assume that the
equivilent is somewhere buried in struct resource resource[].
I have no clue as to why this would have changed. It never came up during
any of the discussion (subject:  Specifying properly the PCI driver model on
all linux ...) where I collected most of this information.
Why did this change, and what was wrong with the old base_address[] array?
Since every PCI driver is supposed to get the address from this field, I
think this is a legitimate question.
