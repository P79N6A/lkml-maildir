This problem has been plaguing us for a while.  You're using gcc 2.96, which is interesting.
What connection tracking/NAT modules have you got?  What kind of traffic are
you getting? (eg. are you getting IRC traffic?  FTP traffic?).
I really want to chase this down, but I've yet to find the cause.
Rusty.
