I am not sure that this is correct argument. Why does a driver request
and release device's resources? "Higher power" has already requested 
these resources for the device and this is not drivers task to free
them. However you are right that we should not free resources until
device is marked for deletion and driver's ->remove() method completes
but I would not rely on surrounding code for keeping an extra reference
and would just take one explicitely in platform_device_del().
