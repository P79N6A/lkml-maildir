Brian,
This was true in the past and with many older drivers.  However when and
if the new driver I have is adpoted, it will make SCSI cry.  So please
stop polluting the issue.
Let me be as objective as I can be.
I built a special Mylex 3-channel raid 10 systems using 6 15K drive at
Ultra160.  Given that I was clever, I was able to push that system to read
and write at 170MB/sec.  I was very impressed by this performance, however
this was hardware raid, caching of 256MB, and 66/64 pci bus.  This was a
dual PIII w/ 2GB of EEC-Buffered-Registered.
Now I have managed to use two hosts w/ 4 channels no caching controller,
no hardware raid, 4 7200RPM drives and software raid 0.  I was able to
push 109MB/sec writing and 167MB/sec reading.
Also under a similar environment, I was able to, using a single card, 4
drives, not hardware-raid, no caching controller, reach 90MB/sec writing
and reading was about 78MB/sec.
Now lets adjust cost of componets and SCSI loses big.
Once there are 10K ATA drives in the market, and none exist that I know of
to date even in beta, then we can retest .
In the meantime here is another dose of reality.
