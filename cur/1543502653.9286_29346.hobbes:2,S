Summary: 2.3.9 okay.  2.3.10 not.
When attempting to boot 2.3.10, the console switches resolutions
according to the "vga = 791" statement in my lilo.conf file, but
the display goes blank and stays that way.  The mode switch is
actually taking place according to the indicator on the monitor,
but nothing is displayed following the switch.
Any ideas?
