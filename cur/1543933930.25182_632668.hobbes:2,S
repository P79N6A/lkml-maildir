ok, that looks like really minimal impact, so i'm in favor of merging 
this into arch/x86 - and the unification it does later on is nice too.
to get more test feedback: what would be the best way to get this tested 
in x86.git in a standalone way? Can i just pick up these 10 patches and 
remove all the non-x86 arch changes, and expect it to work - or are the 
other percpu preparatory/cleanup patches in -mm needed too?
