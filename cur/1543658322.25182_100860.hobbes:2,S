   There is some suspicious-looking use of MAX_ADDR_LEN in
   drivers/net/sungem.c and drivers/s390/net/lcs.c but I did not touch
   those files in this patch.
 ...   
   Please apply this patch or let me know what needs to change for it to
   be applied.
I applied the patch and added a #warning to the powerpc bits of
sungem.c that look suspicious.
Thanks.
