Oops.  Please ignore the PROT_EXEC.  That is completely irrelevant.
I'm sorry I included it; the inclusion of PROT_EXEC was a mistake.
Delete PROT_EXEC, then re-read my email -- everything else in there is
still valid.
The security exploit I explained didn't involve executing anything
from the mmap'ed page; the kernel reads an address from this page,
and then dereferences it.  Even without PROT_EXEC, it sounds like a
user-triggerable NULL pointer dereference in the kernel can create a
local root exploit (at least in some cases).
