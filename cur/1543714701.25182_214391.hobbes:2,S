The problem is that the kernel does assume you know what you are
talking about, and you don't.  You are abusing the mem= parameter. 
That's fine, but then you have to tell the kernel what you really
mean.  What you really want to say is there is memory above 500M and I
don't want you to touch it.  There may be a way to do that via the
fancy mem=@ parameters.
What mem= tells the kernel is that there is RAM in a certain spot an
no where else.  Since you told the kernel there is no ram about 500M,
that means that address space is free to be used for memory mapped
I/O.  Since the kernel trusts you, it started using the memory above
500m for memory mapped i/o.  Since you LIED to the kernel, you are
getting results you do not like.  The solution I settled on was to
tell the kernel that people LIE to it and only use memory for I/O if
both the BIOS and the USER agree that it's available.   You have to
find a way to tell the kernel the TRUTH, or you will never get the
results you want.
