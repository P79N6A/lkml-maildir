Ok, its not MTRR_SANITIZER. It hung again on hibernate, again before any 
serious hibernating work has started. I will add debug output to my 
pre-hibernate script as it might hang already in there, maybe while 
disabling the network. I want to know whether it hangs before calling the 
hibernate script or after it. I think I will go for the latest official 
hibernate patch instead of using the inofficial one, although I am not 
convinced that it makes much of a difference. Lets see.
The syncs I added to my pre-hibernate seemed to help. KDE configuration is 
intact. As a safeguard I rsync ~/.kde to a backup directory before 
hibernating anyway.
Lets see what ideas I have to continue that Sherlock Holmes game ;)
I am puzzled that it only happens on my ThinkPad T42, not on the T23 and 
neither on the Dell workstation - till now.
Goodnight ;-),
