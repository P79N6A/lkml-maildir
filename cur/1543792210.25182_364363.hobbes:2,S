Some packages use dpatch and related tools like this, and give you a
pristine upstream tarball and broken-out patches, but it is not
supported at the level that RPMs do---which is to say, in the core
tool.
Seriously, I pulled apart a whole lot of RPMs when I was doing the
first real (libc6) port of Debian to the Alpha in '96, and it was a
lot easier than dealing with the generally mashed-together patches in
a debian package's .diff.gz.
