I don't have a clue but the same problem on an amd64 system. I am 
running a 64bit 2.6.9-rc1-mm4 kernel on my machine and if i add the boot 
parameter report_lost_ticks it reports the same messages as your 
machine. Since 2.6.7 there is this parameter, before the lost ticks 
where reported all the time. I always thought that this is a 64bit 
problem because i have heard from others which have this problem too. 
Why are we loosing ticks? On my system it happens almost when an acpi 
event occurs. I know that they aren't reported anymore but I don't like 
the thing that my processor (or timesource) looses something.
