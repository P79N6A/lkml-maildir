Dear, 
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred
under the co-operation of a new partner from Paraguay. Presently Im in South
Korea for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile,
i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring
those funds despite that it failed us somehow.Now contact my secretary. His
name is BENSON ALI and his email address is legalconsultants@myway.com.Ask
him to send you the total $3.5 million U.S dollars which i kept for your
compensation for all your past efforts and attempts to assist me in this
matter.I appreciated your efforts at that time very much,so feel free and
get in touch with my secretary BENSON ALI and instruct him where to send
the amount to you. 
Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the
joy after all the sufferings at this time,in the moment, i'm very busy here
because of the investment projects which me and the new partner are having
at hand, finally,remember that i had forwarded instruction to the secretary
on your behalf to receive those money,so feel free to get in touch with him
to send the amount to you without any delay. 
With best regards, 
MR JOHN OKOROCHA.
