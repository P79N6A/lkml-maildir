Dan has done more work on iop13xx than I have, and I'm OK with his
changes.
It's true that ARM-specific changes generally should go through the ARM
tree, but IMHO sometimes it makes sense to have one patch touch both
stuff under drivers/ and stuff under arch/arm/mach-foo, especially if
the changes are dependent and cause compile breakage if applied
separately.  Not sure whether that's the case here.
