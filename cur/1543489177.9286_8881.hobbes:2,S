   Gee, can we say rampant speculation? ;-)
   No statement was made on your question (one way or another).
Actually, it is rampant curiosity.
The hint of speculation comes from the fact that original poster's
statements imply that the solution I am hinting at is known to be
infeasible or is not implemented in IA64 :-)
How about that for a clarification? :)
