If you know kernel data cache doesn't help your workload at all then you want
use O_DIRECT at least to save the CPU.  You can run 2.4.4pre3aa3 or apply the
rawio-3 patch and then the o_direct-2 patch on top of 2.4.4pre3 if you want
O_DIRECT support (it also fixes the O_SYNC wait for locked inode bug noticed by
Marcelo).
You will find detailed explanation on the O_DIRECT feature and where to
find the patches if you grep for subject O_DIRECT in the l-k list in the
messages of this month.
