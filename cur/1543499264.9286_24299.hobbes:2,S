Hi, I'm new to the list.  I checked the archives out for my problem, and
saw I'm not the only one experiencing it.  It seems just using kernel
2.2.10 corrupts my ext2 partition.  I was wondering if anyone has a patch
posted somewhere, or something around those terms.  Sorry to bog you down
with stupid questions.
