Hmm... I've been watching those 3ware discussions with interest as
well, but I haven't seen any commments on how well they work as JBOD
controllers, esp if you get smaller ones with fewer channels and
stripe/mirror between controllers.  If you pair disks between
controllers, then that should limit the downtime, and also improve
performance.
I've been thinking that getting a pair of the two or four change old
74xx series 3ware controllers and then striping across RAID pairs done
between controllers.
