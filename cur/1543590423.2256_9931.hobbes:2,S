remeber why last yaer I was advocating a CONFIG_HIGHMEM option also in
2.4 and not only in 2.2? If we had that now I would tell you "set
HIGHMEM to y until we fix it" and you could use more up to terabyte of
ram in the meantime.

can you try to set DEBUG_NODIRECT to 1 in pci_iommu.c and then to boot
with mem=2048M, if you can reproduce I should be able to reproduce too.
