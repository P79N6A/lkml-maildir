What kernels balance the loads properly?  When I did some simple tests
with a dual Xeon 2.4, I couldn't get it Linux to balance properly.
About 30% of the time it would be off balance with two CPU bound
processes, and that is about the statistical rate.  I think that was
with 2.4.20, but might have been 2.4.18.  With 3 processes, one would
always get an unfair advantage compared to the other two.
