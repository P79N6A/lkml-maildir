OK, well I've seen your name around a lot, but you never know...

Well, 'mount' output is useless w.r.t. the root filesystem, because it is
simply copied from /etc/fstab.  You need to check /proc/mounts to see if
it is _ever_ being mounted as ext3 (lots of people have this problem,
especially if they use initrds and ext3 as a module).
If it _is_ being mounted as ext2 sometimes and ext3 other times, it
would be informative to get the dmesg output, because it will tell
you why it couldn't load the journal.  Note that if there _is_ a
journal in use, it would normally prevent the filesystem from being
mounted as ext2 entirely after a crash.
Cheers, Andreas
