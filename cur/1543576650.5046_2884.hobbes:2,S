I have already made such program.
I detect most of PCI devices, filesystem (if in /etc/fstab or
/proc/mounts,
console, devices (char and blk dev), other deviced that use
resources,...
[ and I detect also some net protocols !]

My idea is to add also a CONFIG_EXPERT CONFIG_NOVICE,...
In a CONFIG_NOVICE, we can add the (undetectable) software protocols
(PPP, ...
also if user don't use it! (and IMHO we can configure a NOVICE system
that would boot and work without any questions).
Problem: How include it in 2.4?
I designed it to use esr's CML2 (for 2.5) and backport as user program
a version of CML2 with the autoconfigure.
The other possible mode: autoconfigure write to .config and user will do
a make oldconfig. But there are to many question (my autoconfigure
say that a driver is need, but it doesn't say 'no'.
Problem 2: ESR now requires Python 2, which is not yet in Debian, and I
think
that this further requisite will delay the inclusion of CML2 in kernel
:-(

PS: my autoconfigure is in 
http://people.debian.org/~cate/autoconfigure
It is updated to the 2.4.0-test12!
PPS: Comments are welcome!
