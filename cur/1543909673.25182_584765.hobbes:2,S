Subject: [PATCH 0/25][V3] pvops_64 last round (hopefully)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is hopefully the last iteration of the pvops64 patch.
From the last version, we have only one change, which is include/asm-x86_64/processor.h: There were still one survivor in raw asm.
Also, git screwed me up for some reason, and the 25th patch was missing the new files, paravirt.{c,h}. (although I do remember having git-add'ed it, but who knows...)
Andrew, could you please push it to -mm ?
Have fun!
