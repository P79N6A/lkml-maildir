If what you are trying to do is terminate the connection earlier,
than reduce the tcp sysctl variable tcp_retries2. This should be the
maximum number of retransmits TCP will make in established state.
The TCP_RTO_MAX parameter is simply an *upper bound* on the 
value of the retransmission timeout, which increases exponentially
from the original timeout value.
