Applied, thank you.

I wanted to be sure that event_mask is set before we schedule event_work
and I don't want to rely on details of queue_delayed_work
implementation. If the fact that queue_delayed_work acts as a barrier
would be listed part of its published spec I would gladly remove wmb()
from atkbd.

Probably, I will need to thiknk about it a bit more.
