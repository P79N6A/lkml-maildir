Very hard to say.
Ted,  Google says this has only been reported three or four times. Could
we please have a BUG() in that code path?
It's probably unrelated to Harley's crash
(
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0009.1/0049.html
), but
then, I have no explanation for Harley's crash.
Having stared sleepily at the code for several evenings I see no way in
which serial_driver.refcount can be non-zero while serial.o's module
refcount is zero.  But it happened.
We can rule out the schedule() in release_dev(), which is definitely an
rmmod window bug, because Harley has confirmed that the "release_dev: %s:
read/write wait queue active!" message did not come out (he still
has the logs).  It's something else.
It would be a shame to put the `struct module *owner' stuff
into the tty layer prior to having an explanation for all of
this, even though it's on the todo list.
