I tried the patch (the 2.3.11 one), and it made me able to list directories on my
windoze partition, but when I tried to read from a file, I only got null in block
mode (vim), and nothing in char mode (cat) (The zeros in vim were probably
just unset memory). A sec after I tried to read from the fs, I got this kernel msg:
kernel BUG at ll_rw_blk: 392
invalid operand: 0000
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[<c0176fcc>]
EFLAGS:    00010282
....
there were some more register and stack info, but my whole VFS were messed
up at that point, so I weren't able to paste it into a file, so I just wrote some of
the stuff down on paper.
My computer is a genuine pentiumMMX- 166mhz. I use egcs-snap19990718,
and my kernel is a 2.3.11 patched with the devfs patch.
