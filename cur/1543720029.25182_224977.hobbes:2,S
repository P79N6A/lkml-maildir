Hi
I want to add a new member (say uint32_t) in the
struct sk_buff{...}
in the file include/linux/skbuff.h.
If i add this new member and I want to assign it
some value when ever function
struct sk_buff *alloc_skb(unsigned int *size,* int gfp_mask)
in file
net/core/skbuff.c
is called
Do I need to allocate memory for this member
(  ie add sizeof(_new-member_) to *size* while doing kmalloc()  )
or I should not worry abt that and I can assign some value
to this _new-member_ every time this function is called.
Thanks
Sushant
