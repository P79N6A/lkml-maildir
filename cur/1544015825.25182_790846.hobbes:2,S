No.
As I said, the construtor is not called.
An object that is given to kmem_cache_free() must be properly constructed.
kmem_cache_free() just adds the obj pointer to a list, the next 
kmem_cache_alloc returns the pointer.
This is also documented in mm/slab.c:
 * The memory is organized in caches, one cache for each object type.
 * (e.g. inode_cache, dentry_cache, buffer_head, vm_area_struct)
 * Each cache consists out of many slabs (they are small (usually one
 * page long) and always contiguous), and each slab contains multiple
 * initialized objects.
 *
 * This means, that your constructor is used only for newly allocated
 * slabs and you must pass objects with the same initializations to
 * kmem_cache_free.
 *
If the idr code passes uninitialized objects to kmem_cache_free(), then 
the next kmem_cache_alloc will return a bad object.
