Hi guys,
my job has kept me very busy in the last 4 months, so I've loose a lot of
topics ( mostly all ) of
linux-kernel.
Yesterday I've installed GCC 2.9.5-1 and I've tried to rebuild some packages
of which, in my absence,
has been released new versions.
As a result a lot of them failed to compile due to a more strict error
checking and other issues and
some of them got crashed after the rebuild step !
Sad of this behaviour I've jumped to build the new kernels ( 2.2.13 &
2.3.22 ) that compile fine but got crashed !
Now my questions are :
1) What's happened to GCC ?
2) Which way has they choosen to follow ?
3) If a new behaviour has been introduced, why not keep it as a choice ( at
least for a bit of transition time ), leaving
    the maintainers the time to adjust code ?
4) When ( If ?!??! ) GCC will rejoin Linux kernel code ?
Sad but hopefull,
    Davide.
