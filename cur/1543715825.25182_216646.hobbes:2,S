2 ideas:
Printing if the tainted module is loaded or unloaded
and/or
using the /proc/tainted interface to enable/disable loading of tainted 
modules.
So that are 2 different things: a) how do we handle the tainted mods 
notifications and b) if we let the user decide if he/she wants tainted 
modules to be "blocked"
