Probably a more sensible rule would be to say 16k or 1 block,
whichever is smaller. Note that on 8k file systems, 12k is not an
integral number of blocks, but 16k is, hence the change.
Related to this, can I pass on a question I was recently asked: How
does Linux deal with a corrupted partition where the lost+found entry
is itself corrupted? Does it even detect that?
Best wishes from Riley.
