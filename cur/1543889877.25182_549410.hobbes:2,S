Yes, of course, please prove a link / connection between that and this?

That might be, but I was only saying that there is no syntactical
*compulsion* to combine the attribute with the return type. As for what's
readable, it is subjective. And as for what's common / standard / idiomatic
in the kernel code as of today, nothing beats a grep. Anyway, as I said
previously, I'm fine with either way.
