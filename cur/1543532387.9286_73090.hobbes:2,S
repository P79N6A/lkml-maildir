Hi,
sorry for being offtopic, but recently I've seen a lot of posts
and infos regarding WinTV cards from company that I think name
is Hauppauge but others spell differently, Hauppage. Even pci
database lists them as Hauppage.
Did that company change it's name ?
I have WinTV card and box says Hauppauge.
