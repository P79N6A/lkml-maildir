This whole "OSS is cross platform" thing seems mostly like a cop out by
lazy developers who can't be bothered to grok ALSA.  None of the usual
offenders (Skype, Quake 3, Doom 3) run on any other Unix platform so why
not just use ALSA?
It does not help that the most problematic apps seem to be proprietary
(most likely they are abusing the OSS API in a way that no one
anticipated).
