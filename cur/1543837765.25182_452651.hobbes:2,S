Thanks Jesper.  Hmm, lessee - this is a cancelled dirty rename
transaction ... could be ondisk dir2 corruption (any chance this
filesystem was affected by 2.6.17's endian bug?), or something
else entirely.  No I/O errors in the system log earlier or anything
like that?

That wont be related, no.

OK, I'd be interested to see if that reported any directory (or
other) issues.
cheers.
