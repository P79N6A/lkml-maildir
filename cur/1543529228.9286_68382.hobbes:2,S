yep, this is exactly the plan, but with a bit more flexible 'syscall
numbering and parametering' interface. Remember, we might want to have
several future iterations of this, even if it costs a few cycles in the
entry code. I'll re-post the patch (with additions, the current one is
mainly a proof of concept thing showing the major benefits and design
elements) for 2.5 once the tree opens, but i think now lets concentrate on
2.4 :-)
