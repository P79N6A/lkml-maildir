Another possibility is for a module to make an explicit "flush" call when it
is happy to have parameters updated.  I'll call the parameter "p".  The
moduleparam code would need keep a copy "p_current" of p as well
as a pointer "&p" to the actual parameter p.  Writes to p would only update
p_current, not p, so would not immediately be seen by the module's code. 
A call to flush would then write p_current to the actual parameter *(&p).  This has
the advantage of centralizing locking in the common moduleparam code,
which needs to ensure that p_current is updated atomically.
It has the down side that driver writers will have to call flush at appropriate
times, which could be a maintenance burden (I'm thinking of
drivers/usb/core/devio.c which has a writeable parameter usbfs_snoop
which causes usbfs ioctls to be logged when set; it doesn't hurt if usbfs_snoop
changes at any time; but when adding a new use of usbfs_snoop it would be
easy to forget to put a flush call in every code path leading there).  Still, this
is much lighter weight that having drivers take a module_param_rwsem
whenever they access parameters.
All the best,
Duncan.
