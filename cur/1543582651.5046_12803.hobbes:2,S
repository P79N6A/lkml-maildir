YIPES. I didn't realize this was the case.. how is end-to-end application
flow control handled when the bottle neck is user space bound and not b/w
bound? e.g. if i write a test app that does a
while(1) {
    sleep (5);
    read(sock, buf, 1);
}
and the transmitter is unrestricted, what happens?
Does it have to do with TCP_FORMAL_WINDOW (eg. automatically reduce window
size to zero when queue backs up?)
or is it only a cpu loading problem? (ie. is there a difference in queuing
behavior between 1) the user process doesnt get cycles 2) the user process
simply fails to read ?)
Also, I have been reading up on CONFIG_HW_FLOWCONTROL.. what is the
recommended way for the driver to stop receiving? In the sample tulip
code i see you can register a xon callback, but i can't tell if there
is a way to see the backlog from the driver.
