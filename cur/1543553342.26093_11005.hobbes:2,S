Every software seems to be buggy and gcc does not seem to be better than 
the kernel in this area.

You were just claiming that other main Linux packagers do also suggest a
different compiler version for the kernel, which was only part of the
facts that let RedHat 7 have been loose with its kgcc/gcc mess.
And since it seems that everybody can build a Linux based package in his 
garage and then find morons to buy it, let me ask my mother-in-law if 
she also did so and let the planet know how she decide to handle the
kernel compiler issue, if this can let you feel better. :o)

Wrong, as far as it is David S. Miller who is one of the greatest Linux 
contributors that made Linux become what it is nowadays, mostly as a free
contributors for years.
I would even accept something like "you caring about your stock-options
not to be victimized by RH7 kgcc blundering", but certainly not that you
just want to blindly defend your employer for corporate reasons.
