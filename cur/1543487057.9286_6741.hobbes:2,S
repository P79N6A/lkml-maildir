You could do something really wacky like:
Make it impossible to post to linux-kernel directly; people have to post
to the 'sub-lists', then all messages to the sub lists are combined and sent
to linux-kernel subscribers. That way people have to choose the appropriate
sub-list to post to, and people who don't want to sub to the whole linux-kernel
package can choose sub-lists.
How you get people to post to the right list and not to cc to irrelevent ones
is still a problem though. In most real world systems, it tends to be the
people who are the problem :)
