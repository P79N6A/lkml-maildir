Eric,
I agree that clearing the IORESOURCE_BUSY flag would not alleviate
this problem.  Could you please post the output of 'lspci -vvvvx' so
we could better understand the layout of your box?  Perhaps I might
have to defer the registration of the resources until later.  It seems
weird that the IO APIC are mapped in as PCI devices though.
