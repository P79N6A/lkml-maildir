Hello again.
Ok. Sorry. My fault. The second patch produces the same throughput... I didn't realized that the kernel disabled DMA during rebooting. My drives only went to DMA again after a cold boot. Don't know what's going on here. But after a normal reboot, my drives are in PIO only and don't support DMA.
cdparanoia on /dev/scd0 now gives the same result as with the first patch.
