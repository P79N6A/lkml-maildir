If the other cgroups are busier, and t1-t2 is longer, then the cgroup
will get to the point where it's ready to sleep later in wallclock
time, and t4-t3 will be shorter in absolute terms. If there were no
other cgroups running, then presumably the sleep time would actually
be the sum of those three periods.
Even so, I guess you're right that t4-t3 is the most appropriate thing
to report, as long as people realise that it's a bit of a fuzzy value.

Sorry, I didn't mean "how will you report it to users?", I meant "what
kinds of useful information will the users be able to get from it?"
