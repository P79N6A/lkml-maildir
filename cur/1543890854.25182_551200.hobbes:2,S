I'd do it with something like "newfd = dup2(fd, NONLINEAR_FD)" or similar, 
and just have NONLINEAR_FD be some magic value (for example, make it be 
0x40000000 - the bit that says "private, nonlinear" in the first place).
But what's gotten lost in the current discussion is that we probably don't 
actually _need_ such a private space. I'm just saying that if the *choice* 
is between memory-mapped interfaces and a private fd-space, we should 
probably go for the latter. "Everything is a file" is the UNIX way, after 
all. But there's little reason to introduce private fd's otherwise.
