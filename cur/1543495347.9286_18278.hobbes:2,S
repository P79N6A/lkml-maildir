Yes sure, but if I send a arp request I need to listen all arp responses
and the arp cache isn't updated.
Simple solution in the application is to send something to the host but
that's a kludge ;). And I don't want to send extra packets. 
Is it possible to get the mac address for a received ip packet in user
space (negative offset or something)? That could save my day. 
Cheers,
