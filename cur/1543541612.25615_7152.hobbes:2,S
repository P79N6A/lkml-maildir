There is a much more fundamental problem that generally doesnt show up on
NT because NT is generally still used like windows 3.0 was even though it
has multi-user capabilities.
Who can attach notes and info to a file. I as a user want a different icon
to someone else. Perhaps I want my note in English and you want the notes
in Portugese ?
Multi-part files are a bad hack - they are hard to extend the format on, they
dont identify the metadata catalog and how to parse it. You'd be far better
generating a single stream , even in something trendy like XML. At least
then I can always parse the data, I can extend it and I can merge it with
a personal database of overrides
