In 2.6.20-rc1, some of these files have other files with the same name 
in the same directory (modulo case).  Perhaps this is confusing cifs.
Can you check where all of the files in your case share that property?
example:
    [avi@firebolt linux-2.6]$ find net -iname ipt_tos.c
    net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TOS.c
    net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_tos.c
    [avi@firebolt linux-2.6]$ find net -iname ipt_ecn.c
    net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_ECN.c
    net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_ecn.c

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
