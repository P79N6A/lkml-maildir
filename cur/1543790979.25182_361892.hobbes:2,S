I haven't seen a browser that does this (it would break a lot of sites), I 
have seen the option when you go to accept a cookie to accept it for this 
session only, so a note to the user to allow the cookie to persist may be 
enough, or we can just go the tarball route and the file that gets saved 
and uploaded would be enough.
what browser have you seen this default bahavior on?

saving the state on the server means that you have to deal with (or 
somehow eliminate) collisions between different users, it means that you 
need to have the server-side data time out and get garbage collected, and 
in general adds significant complexity to the project.
