Oh .. apparently that message got removed between 2.6.13 and current git
head.
Is there any chance you could try this with the latest git snapshot and
post all the messages from the time the aic79xx is detected to the time
this message appears ... what I'm trying to ascertain is if anything
went wrong in negotiating with the device (2.6.13 unfortunately is a bit
terse on the negotiation messages ... git head will be slightly more
verbose).
Thanks,
James
