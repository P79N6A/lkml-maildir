Ok.

Err... I didn't see it as "insulting [my] users". That was not at all
what I intended. I'll have to rework that...

No, more like, "on the typical Linux system installed since 2000,
running additional 3rd-party software from no earlier than 2001", or
something vaguely like that.

Binary compatibility is good to have, but it isn't everything in life.
*Optionally* breaking compatibility with certain types of old binaries
doesn't seem so bad to me. People who want binary compatibility can have
it, and people who don't need it can choose to not install the old code
on their systems.

It's probably the case that on millions (and growing) of Linux systems
out there, the one and only possible use of this syscall is as a
security threat. On these systems, with no need for libc4/5 binaries
(and no installed versions of these libraries anyway), there is **NO**
other redeeming use for this syscall.
If removal of this syscall isn't a config option, then the alternatives
are out-of-tree patches, forking 2.7 over this issue alone, or settling
for the status quo. A 3rd-party patch would increase vendor kernel
divergence again (which is also evil), and starting 2.7 just for this
would be overkill. And I'm not the only person who is not satisfied
with the current situation.

A config option for each one would be a bit much, I'll agree. However,
I think having a single config option for the whole bunch would be a
good idea. At the time that I wrote this patch, I was thinking that the
rest of the old syscalls would be a second config option, but now that I
think about it, it makes more sense for it to just be one config option,
not two.
FWIW, my current patch does uselib() alone, because I figured that would
be less controversial than trying to do all of the old syscalls now.
Maybe I'll rethink that decision though.
Thank you for your feedback. It's quite helpful, and I greatly
appreciate it.
