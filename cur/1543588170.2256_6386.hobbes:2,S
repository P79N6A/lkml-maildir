I suspect that simple pipe with would be sufficient to handle contention
case - nothing fancy needed (read when you need to block, write upon up()
when you have contenders)
Would something along the lines of (inline as needed, etc.)
down:
	lock decl count
	js __down_failed
down_done:
	ret
up:
	lock incl count
	jle __up_waking
up_done:
	ret
__down_failed:
	call down_failed
	jmp down_done
__up_waking:
	call up_waking
	jmp up_done
down_failed()
{
	read(pipe_fd, &dummy, 1);
}
up_waking()
{
	write(pipe_fd, &dummy, 1);
}
be enough?
