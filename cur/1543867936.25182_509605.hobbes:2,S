I take my words back. It is not "ugly" any longer because with this change
we don't do kthread_stop()->wakeup_process() while cwq->thread may sleep in
work->func(). Still I don't see (ok, I am biased and probably wrong, please
correct me) why kthread_stop+wait_to_die is better than cwq_should_stop(),
see below.

Please look at 2.6.20-mm1, cleanup is synchronous. Probably we misunderstood
each other looking at different code.

Perhaps do it, but why? The failure should be rare, and it is a bit
dangerous to have workqueue_struct which was not properly initialized.
Suppose we change CPU_UP_PREPARE so it is called before freeze_processes()
stage, then we have a problem.

See above.
Srivatsa, don't get we wrong. I can't judge about using freezer for cpu hotplug,
but yes, we can improve workqueue.c in this case! But this changes should be
small and understandable. When cpu hotplug is converted, we don't need _any_
changes in workqueue.c, it should work (except s/CPU_DEAD/CPU_DEAD_KILL_THREADS
if you insist). Then,
	[PATCH] make all multithread workqueus freezable
	[PATCH] remove cpu_populated_map
		just remove, very easy. Good change!
	[PATCH] restore take_over_works()
		This is not strictly needed! But ok, this can speedup cpu_down,
		and now we can't have a race with flush_worqueue (freezer).
		Just do
			case CPU_XXX:	// all tasks are frozen
			+	take_over_work(wq, hotcpu);
		No more changes are required, cwq_should_stop() just works
		because it is more flexible than kthread_should_stop().
	[PATCH] don't take workqueue_mutex in ...
	[PATCH] ...
Probably I missed something, and we should fix/improve/drop cwq_should_stop(),
but please do this in a separate patch, with a proper changelog which explains
why we are doing so.
Currently I believe that workqueue.c will need very minimal and simple changes
if we use freezer.
Oleg.
