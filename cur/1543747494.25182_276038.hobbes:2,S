If Linux 2.6.9 is booted on a 40 MHz `486 with the standard
ISA clock of 14.3 MHz (yes that's the standard), the kernel
will complain about a keyboard timeout for every key touched!
Somebody apparently didn't test their changes sometime in
the past I've seen this also on 2.4.26, but not so often.
Will somebody please double the time-out or tell me where
to fix it! The timeout was only supposed to handle the
fact that a keyboard could get (or be) disconnected. It
can be a long timeout without ever affecting ordinary
use.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
