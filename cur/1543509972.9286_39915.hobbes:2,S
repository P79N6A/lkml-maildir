   I've seen this after restarting networking with
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart. Redhat 6, hand-compiled
   2.2.1[012] kernel, with nothing fancy except firewalling. I'v also
   seen multiples of seconds up to 5 and 6.
Do I sense that the common denominator in this problem is that some
form of DHCP/pump/whatever is being used?  If that is common amongst
everyone seeing this problem, it would be nice to know.
