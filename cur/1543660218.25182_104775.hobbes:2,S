So it was stable under earlier kernels?

There's nothing in the trace to indicate a hardware fault.  Is there
anything else showing up in the logs which might indicate the kernel
getting into a tangle?
From the assert failure:

it looks as if either the VM has been recursing into the filesystem
(filesystem problem or a missing GFP_NOFS somewhere), or there has been
a stack overflow (the data structure that the mismatch is on is just
about the very last thing on the task structure that the stack grows
towards.)
But as for the decoded OOPS, I can't immediately trace through it
successfully.  There's no syscall entry point at the top of the stack,
and there appear to be two separate possible interpretations of the call
trace.  Do you have any other captured oopses that I might be able to
find some common threads in?
Cheers,
 Stephen
