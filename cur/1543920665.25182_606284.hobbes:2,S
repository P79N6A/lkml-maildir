I'd prefer just to go along the lines of what I posted. It's
a pure block device driver which knows absolutely nothing about
vm or vfs.
What are you guys using rd for, and is it really important to
have this supposed buffercache optimisation?

Except the page cache doesn't store any such translation. fsblock
works very nicely as a buffer_head and nobh-mode replacement there,
but we could probably go one better (for many filesystems) by using
a tree.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean, unless you're talking about an
extent based data structure. fsblock is fairly slim as far as a
generic solution goes. You could probably save 4 or 8 bytes in it,
but I don't know if it's worth the trouble.

Well I don't want to get too far off topic on the subject of fsblock,
and block mappings (because I think the ramdisk driver simply should
have nothing to do with any of that)... but fsblock is exactly a
buffer head replacement (so if it doesn't make sense, then I've
screwed something up badly! ;))
