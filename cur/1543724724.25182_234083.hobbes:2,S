Nick,
Your patch is great as system delves for pages without eating too much
RSS around.
I just thought about some sort of combination :
	-On one side a swapout regulation
	-But also somekind of smooth swapin operation.
Reason for this being box freeze effect after some heavy load.
I made a slight patchset which tries to do the second path.It's being
called RGR for "RSS Gradual Recovery".It works with 2 sysctl parameters
for testing :
	-swapoff_max_swapout :  It proceeds when kswapd has not reported more
than this.
	-swapoff_smooth_range : Number of pages to swap in at once.
That process uses a try_to_unuse patched version to emerge some pages
when swapout is relaxed.That stuff is done in a swap device transparent
poll method and should result in GUI application foregrounding done
quickly even after some heavy-load storm; my problem being where this
one can be called from ? As an example, I put a swapoff_smooth in
do_anonymous_page but it's not the right location I guess :))) just
wanted some place frequently called to see effects.
Of course, your help would be appreciated ;)
