Ingo,
I noticed that you perform the RDTSC synchonization only if the kernel
was compiled with "CONFIG_X86_TSC".
I think this is a bad idea:
RDTSC is available to user space, an unsynchronized RDTSC might confuse
user mode programs.
Couldn't you convert the code from the #define to ".x86_capability &
TSC"?
I've tested your patch on a
	Gigabyte BXD, Dual PII/350 Deschutes [intel 440BX]
	APIC Version 17
	IO-APIC Version 17
Everything seems fine.
I noticed that if the computer is idle, then there is a strong bias of
the timer interrupts to CPU1 (19,343 interupts on CPU0, 84415 interrupts
on CPU1).
[this bias is also present with 2.2.12]
The bias goes away under load [ie constant flood ping].
