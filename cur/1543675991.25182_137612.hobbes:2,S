Paul,
Setting SERIAL_DEBUG_PCI gives me this:
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ IRQ sharing enabled
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
Setup PCI port: port bc00, irq 21, type 0
ttyS14 at I/O 0xbc00 (irq = 21) is a 16550A
Setup PCI port: port bc08, irq 21, type 0
ttyS15 at I/O 0xbc08 (irq = 21) is a 16550A
Setup PCI port: port bc10, irq 21, type 0
ttyS2 at I/O 0xbc10 (irq = 21) is a 16550A
Setup PCI port: port bc18, irq 21, type 0
ttyS3 at I/O 0xbc18 (irq = 21) is a 16550A
Doesn't give us much more detail.
BTW, this is the entry in 8250_pci.c for the board in question:
        {       PCI_VENDOR_ID_PLX, PCI_DEVICE_ID_PLX_1077,
                PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 
                pbn_b2_4_921600 },
Note that the ttyS's _are_ numbered in sequence in 2.4.20
