Subject: [BUG?][2.4.xx] - SB Driver (SBAWE32) -  Explosion sound on init

Odd, When I boot up with 2.4.20 and the sound driver is about to init I hear a 
explosion sound from the speakers each time I power off and on the machine.
Is this a initialization bug in resetting the card on boot?
Any ideas?
Shawn.
