I think the "next" field can be u32 instead of u64. Because the linked
list of struct setup_data is prepared by bootloader, which can control
the memory location.
To facilitate the kernel early mapping, I think the memory location of
"linked list" should be kept to a predefined range (in the real mode
memory area?).

Previously, I think the "zero page" is not external formally, so we can
ignore the user. But it is used by some bootloaders. So your proposal
may be better, especially for these bootloaders.
I think something others need to be done:
- Increase the version number of standard boot protocol.
- Add the contents of zero page into standard boot protocol document as
a optional part for 32-bit entry (and 64-bit entry?).
- Make 32-bit (64-bit?) boot protocol formal in standard boot protocol
document.

As for the magic number in zero page, do you think it should be used
only by 16-bit kernel setup code?

Yes.
