Why would a userspace driver not work out for this.  We already can
saturate the USB bus with a userspace program, and since it requires a
userspace interaction to do something with the data, I don't really see
what a kernel driver could do to help thing out.
That being said, perhaps it would fit with the other USB data
acquisition drivers that we already have.  Feel free to take this up
with me off-list if you want to.
Hm, wait, in looking at the specs for the device, it uses a
usb-to-serial chip that we already support quite well (with the
pl2303.ko driver.)  So all you need to do is write some userspace
software that interacts with the device properly.  No new kernel driver
is needed at all, as Linux already supports this hardware :)
thanks,
