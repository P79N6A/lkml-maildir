I agree.  To rephrase I believe it is inappropriate to assume a
classic x86 PCBIOS is present on the machine.
All the shutdown routines should do is to place the hardware in a
quiescent state, that the linux driver init code can recover from.
Since arbitrary code can be loaded leaving this policy to the users of
the kexec system call is reasonable.

The system call does not.  My user space component needs a bit more
work to bypass setup.S and do a reasonable job at it.  I have all of
the code in a tested state except the code that queries the current
kernel for the BIOS setup information.
Getting the last pieces together so I can reliably boot a linux kernel
is the next step.  My user space started out as a proof of concept and
is evolving into something useful from there.  I refuse to use the
hack of copying the empty_zero_page from the old kernel to the new
kernel.
