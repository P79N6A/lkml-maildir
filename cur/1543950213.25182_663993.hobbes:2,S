I think there are two different kinds of sharing going on here:
- A and B each have individual limits, and you additionally want their
total usage to be capped by some parent limit. E.g. A and B each have
a 100MB memory limit, and you want their total combined usage to not
exceed 150MB. This kind of sharing has to be handled by the resource
counter abstraction
- you want A and B to be treated identically for the purposes of some
particular resource, e.g. you want a single CFS group to which all
threads in A and B are equal members, or a single memory cgroup for
all allocations by A or B, or the same device control table for A and
B (but you want A and B to be treated separately for some other
resource type). This can be handled in userspace in the way I outlined
above, and it would be good if libcg could handle the setup required
for this. It could also be done in the kernel with something like the
parent/child subsystem group inheritance that I also mentioned above,
if there was demand. But if so it should be a property of cgroups
rather than any individual resource controller, since it's a feature
that could be useful for all cgroups.
