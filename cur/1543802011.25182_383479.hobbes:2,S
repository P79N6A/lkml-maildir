I think this is a problem that does not come along quite frequently.
We have got a machine, lets say X , make is IBM and the CPU is Intel
Pentium 4 2.60 GHz. Its running a 2.6.13.1 Kernel and previously,
2.6.27-4 Kernel the distribution is Debian Sagre.

The problem is that, after a some time ( fuzzy , but I think like 2
hours ) of inactivity or because of some esoteric factor which triggers
a state in which the time on the machine starts going around in a loop.
if I do cat /proc/uptime, it goes 4  ticks ahead and again rewinds back
to the starting count ( not zero, but the moment in time when the event
was triggred. )
The problem seems to be specific to the 2.6 series of kernel, not the
2.4 series.
I  would like to know how to go about the debugging of the problem, and
that which specific part of the kernel will be directly interacting with
the rtc / system clock.
Thanks,
Chaitanya
