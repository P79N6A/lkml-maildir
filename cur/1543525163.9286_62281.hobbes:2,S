Subject: Linux 2.3.41, 2.3.42... Broken on PowerPC (Can't be compiled)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/2/10/41

Some changes have been made in the code, like new typedef, etc... these
modifications
are not present in powerpc asm include files... Some work is needed to
resync these parts
