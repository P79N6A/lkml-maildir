Because the standard cmpxchg is missing only on  386, but cmpxchg8b is

Citing Intel's Instruction set reference:
cmpxchg:
This instruction is not supported on Intel processors earlier than the
Intel486 processors.
cmpxchg8b:
This instruction encoding is not supported on Intel processors earlier
than the Pentium processors.
