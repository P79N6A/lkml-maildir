Subject: [PATCH] Make VLSI FIR depend on X86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings,
This is a trivial patch against the Kconfig entry for the VLSI FIR driver to
make it depend on X86.  The in-tree code guarantees that the driver will only
build on X86, and according to the comments therein no machine of another
architecture has this hardware anyway.
Granted, no human intelligently configuring a kernel for his or her particular
system would make this mistake, but perhaps someone building a distribution
kernel would.  I suggest this patch because it keeps the signal to noise ratio
for those testing allyesconfig builds low.
This patch applies to the linux-2.5 BK tree as of 0400 UTC 10/20/2003, and for
some time before that as well.  Please consider for eventual inclusion.  It may
be too much of a fringe case until 2.6.0 begins its stable series.
Thanks,
Noah
