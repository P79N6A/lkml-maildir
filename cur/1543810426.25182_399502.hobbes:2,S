Thanks. I actually meant to use the existing driver_data field for it,
but on second thought using a new field like you did makes sense
because we could use that to easily enable MSI and possibly other
advanced features in the future too.
Only thing I would double check is if the generation of modules.pcimap
(that is used by distribution installers to load the right drivers
automatically) still works correctly.
