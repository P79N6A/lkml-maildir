It's not _just_ makefiles, though.  Packaging systems know what to do 
with configure scripts, and automatically plug that into their systems, 
e.g. with rpm's %configure, %make_install, etc.
Having ported an entire distro, the time savings with autotools [OR 
ANOTHER STANDARD BUILD/CONFIGURE SYSTEM] are very real.  Similarly, the 
time sink with each project doing its own home-rolled build/configure 
system is also very real.
