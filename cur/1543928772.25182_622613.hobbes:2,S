Let's say device_register() calls device_init(), which calls 
kobject_init(), which fails.  Then there's no cleanup to do -- 
device_register() returns -ENOMEM or some such code and the caller has 
to do the kfree().
Now let's say device_register() calls device_init(), which succeeds, 
and then calls device_add(), which fails.  To recover properly, 
somebody then has to call device_put().  That "somebody" can't be the 
original caller -- according to the previous paragraph the original 
caller won't do anything but kfree().  So the "somebody" has to be 
device_register() itself.
But the device_put() will call kobject_put(), which will invoke the
device's cleanup routine, which will deallocate the structure.  Now the
original caller gets an error code (perhaps -ENOMEM again) but must
_not_ call kfree().
So what should the original caller do when an error occurs?
