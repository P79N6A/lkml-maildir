Well, I've changed timer_resume() in arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c into the 
following function:
static int timer_resume(struct sys_device *dev)
{
	unsigned long flags;
	unsigned long sec;
	unsigned long ctime = get_cmos_time();
	long sleep_length = (ctime - sleep_start) * HZ;
	if (vxtime.hpet_address)
		hpet_reenable();
	sec = ctime + clock_cmos_diff;
	write_seqlock_irqsave(&xtime_lock,flags);
	xtime.tv_sec = sec;
	xtime.tv_nsec = 0;
	write_sequnlock_irqrestore(&xtime_lock,flags);
	printk ("jiffies = %lu, sleep_length = %ld\n", jiffies, sleep_length);
	return 0;
}
and that's what I get from the log:
Jan 12 19:43:42 albercik kernel: jiffies = 4294847120, sleep_length = 
-3189288131000
(for example - the second number is always negative and huge).  Would it mean 
that get_cmos_time() needs fixing?
