huh??
in the proposal that I made all the HW specific code would be in the 
device driver. I was just proposing a way for the driver to advertise what 
it is able to do.
why would you want to pull the code out into a seperate model?
many levels of backlight with different power consumption is trivial to 
do.
backlight 1
mode %capability %power
    aka brightness
0        0         0
1      100       100
2       75        75
3       50        50
4       25        25
backlight 2
mode %capability %power
    aka brightness
0        0         0
1      100       100
2       80        50
3       60        30
3       40        20
4       25        15
backlight 2
mode %capability %power
    aka brightness
0        0         0
1      100       100
2       50        90
why do you think the decision makeing logic needs to know the details of 
the hardware? if you can abstract the details out then the same control 
logic can be used for different things. if you infuse the hardware 
knowledge with the control logic then you have to change the control 
section every time you want to support a new piece of hardware.
