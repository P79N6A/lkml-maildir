I have a similar annoying problem...  I have a machine which is almost
always idle (single user work station type thing) with 1.5GB of RAM
and I end up with 850M in slab!
For me the main problem seems to be driven by dentry_cache itself
bloating up really big and those entries keep fs-specific memory
pinned.
Forcing paging will push this down to acceptable levels but it's a
really irritating solution --- I'm still trying to think of a better
way to stop the dentries from using such a disproportionate amount of
memory.
I'm played with -mm kernels and various patches out there...  nothing
seems to put enough pressure on the slab unless I force paging.
akpm, riel --- any (more) ideas here?
