I know.
My question: where do you find
autoconf autoconfigure: symlinks
    $(SHELL_SCRIPT) script/...
This can cause confution, but I don't find ut in the sources.
BTW: I used 'make autoprobe' because of possible confutions, in
latter version. Now Eric will use both 'make autoconfig' and
'make autoprobe'.
The choice of name now is on Eric hands. Important is that
*users* doesn't confuse it.
