One useful feature of it would be that you can get core dumps for 
each thread by including the pid (or tid later with newer threading libraries)
Currently threads when core dumping overwrite each others cores so you lose
the registers of all but one.
Doing multithreaded coredump correctly is a lot more code than this.
Another useful application of an arbitary path name would be dumping to a 
named pipe and having a dr.watson that logs the backtrace to the system log
(of course this has interesting deadlock possibilities when you're not
careful...) 
I would find the feature useful.
