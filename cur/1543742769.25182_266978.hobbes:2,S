Actually, there's one more thing that wories me... Original choice of
PC hotkey (alt-sysrq-key) works *very* badly on many laptop
keyboards. Like sysrq is only recognized with fn, but key is not
recognized when you hold fn => you have no chance to use magic sysrq.
Perphaps sysrq could be made prefix notation? Like alt-sysrq, release,
press s is sync?
