No, the trouble with random order is that half the seeks are backward. I ran
a simple test on my hdd (IBM Deskstar), which just seeks forward 16Mbytes at
a time and (reads one byte from the drive to make sure something happens).
The difference between running forward doing this and running backward is a
factor of 5-6.
