Does this still occur with a more recent upstream kernel ?
There are also known AHA2940 incompatibilities with a few boards. People
always had problems with CUV4X* boards for one. Bit early to assume its
the board however it might be worth making sure the card is well seated
and the cabling looks good. That said I'd expect parity errors..
