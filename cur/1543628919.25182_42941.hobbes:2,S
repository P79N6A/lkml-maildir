I've written some code that allows using an initial tmpfs which gets it's
contents from a tar file (optionally compressed). See
http://www.escape.de/users/outback/linux/patch-2.4.17-inittar.gz
 (should also
work for 2.4.18) and (for later kernels):

But you don't have to swap anything. As I understand, the current concept is:
- a very minimalistic initial fs that doesn't anything meaningful except
  allowing the creation of directories (mount points).
- one or more other fs's on top of this, either overmounted or mounted on a
  mount point.
For example, my patch for 2.4.19-preX just does a
  	sys_mount("tmpfs", "/root", "tmpfs", ...);
	sys_chdir("/root");
Later, the tar image is extracted into this tmpfs. There's no need to swap or
unmount any filesystems. If you want to mount another filesystem as root and
throw away the tmpfs, just use chroot(8) and pivot_root(8).
Correct me if I'm wrong.
