Thanks a lot. I get it now.
As far as races are concerned,  it should be OK. This is because my 
condition uses testbit() and interrupt handler uses setbit(). These 
operations are atomic even on SMP configurations. Right?
What do you think is of lower latency -- a poll() hook or an ioctl() hook?
One thing I could have with ioctl implementation was that I knew in 
kernel space that a timeout has occurred. With poll(), I do not know how 
to catch an error, because the poll function is called many times and I 
do not know which return is last. But it is not critical for me.
