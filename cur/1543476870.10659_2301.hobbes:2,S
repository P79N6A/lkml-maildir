What went wrong is that you sent this message to the linux-kernel list. 
The linux-kernel list is for developers working on the kernel, not for
software support. 
If you would like support, and would like to reach a more appropriate
audience, please submit your query to one of the comp.os.linux newsgroups
(e.g. comp.os.linux.support), or try the #linux or #linuxos channels on
your local efnet irc server.
Thankyou.
Scott
