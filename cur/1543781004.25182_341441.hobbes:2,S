The problem still exists in 2.6.13-rc6.  Usually, all I get is a 
suddenly black display,
solveable by resizing.  But the machine will occationally hang, forcing 
me to
use the reset button.  I lost my mbox file to this (from an ext3 fs, on 
raid-1 on scsi.)
It is hard to say wether the fs problem merely is an effect of hanging 
with rc6.
With rc5, there definitely was some sort of io/scsi problem as one disk
was "lost" until I booted a working kernel.
Currently, it seems like I won't be able to use 2.6.13.
