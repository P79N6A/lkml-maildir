	I've got no luck. I tried the 2.0d12 driver but I get a similar
oops when I try to load the module. The Oops seems to happen during the
scan of the devices on the scsi bus. I have only a cd-writer (a TEAC
CDR-56S) and the scsi chain is properly terminated.
	I haven't reported the oops because I have to write it down by
hand, but there is still a sign of the slab poisoning (the 5a pattern). If
it is useful to you I'm happy to ksymoops the oops again.
