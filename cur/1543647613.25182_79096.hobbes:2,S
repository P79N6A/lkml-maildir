I've updated the contest benchmark to v0.51
http://contest.kolivas.net
I've now included the experimental loads I've been posting to lkml.
These added loads are:
read_load: reads a file the size of the physical memory
list_load: lists the entire directory structure
xtar_load: extracts a tar archive of the kernel tree
ctar_load: creates a tar archive of the kernel tree
Note that the tar loads use up a _lot_ of filesystem space and for safety are 
disabled by default. Use -l all to include them in the contest.
Lots of other minor internal changes.
Con.
