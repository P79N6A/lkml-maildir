The release_dev() changes looks very fishy to me.  It _removes_ locking. 
If that fixes the testcase then one of two things is happening:
a) we have lock_kernel() coverage and the down()'s sleeping breaks the
   lock_kenrel() coverage or
b) we don't have lock_kernel() coverage, but removing the down() just
   alters the timing and makes the race less probable.
I think it's b).  lock_kernel() coverage in there is very incomplete on the
open() side.
I think it would be better to _increase_ the tty_sem coverage in
release_dev() and to make sure that all callers of init_dev() are using
tty_sem (they are).
One approach would be to require that all callers of release_dev() hold
tty_sem, and make release_dev() drop and reacquire tty_sem in those cases
where release_dev() needs to go to sleep when waiting for other threads of
control to reelase the tty's resources.

So you've extended tty_sem coverage over the tty driver's ->open method.  I
guess that's OK.
