Most threads grab the kernel lock when they start. Its a good way to be sure
you can call all the kernel routines without worrying about if they are
fine grained. The lock is "magic" as it is dropped whenever you sleep. In
essence it is not a spinlock/semaphore but a lock that preserves the old style
Unix rules for pre-emption on those who hold it
