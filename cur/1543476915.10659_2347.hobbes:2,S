I thought that the FB code was shooting for VESA 2.1, not 3.0.
Having used the frame buffer code, it is nice, but a last resort.  (It is very
slow compared to something that knows how to write to the card correctly.)
As a side note...  Does anyone have a rational explanation for the "proprietary
interface" mentality as displayed by video and sound card manufacturers?  Why
are they paranoid about something as simple as programming specs?  You would
think that they would want people to write code for their cards.  They seem to
think that some sort of secret will leak out.  So far, I have yet to see any
evidence of any sort of patentable information or things that really need to be
kept secret in these interfaces.  I don't know.  Maybe it is just having worked
with open source for too long...
