Thanks for doing this, it's definitely the way to go.
After a quick look over it, I noted a small mistake:
After the arch/x86_64/kernel/Makefile -> arch/x86/kernel/Makefile_64 
transition, the three foo-$(subst m,y,$(CONFIG_BAR)) got replaced with
foo-$(CONFIG_BAR).
Although the subst's look fishy, such changes shouldn't be part of the 
architecture merge.
