I discussed this with Phillip a bit, and it looks like we'll go for a
2.6.21 merge.  This gives a couple of months for testing and review in
linux-next.
Of course, this assumes that someone will actually perform that testing
and review.  Chances are that it'll just sit there, getting nothing more
than compilation testing.
Apparently I reviewed the code a while back - that grey cell must have
died.  Does anyone else intend to review the code in that timeframe? 
If not, we might as well merge it now, if ever..
