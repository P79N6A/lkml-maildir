Makes sense. I will focus my attention on the disks now (which makes
sense not only because of your information).

Here is the exact message I saw a few weeks ago (posted in here):
ata4: handling error/timeout
ata4: port reset, p_is 0 is 0 pis 0 cmd c017 tf 7f ss 0 se 0
ata4: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
sdd: Current: sense key=0x0
        ASC=0x0 ASCQ=0x0
Info fid=0x0
To my knowledge this time it did not look different at all.

Of course. I even replaced the mainboard (screwdriver accident..) and
power supply (too weak). And I now know that the sata cables I used at
first did not cause the problems :)
Thanks,
