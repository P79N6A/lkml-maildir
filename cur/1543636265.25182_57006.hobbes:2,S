I am afraid I don't have any better ideas but I don't think your patch is 
safe. )-:

That can only be guaranteed by holding i_sem. Since the BKL was taken out 
of ->readdir(), i_sem is now used for exclusion between ->readdir() and 
->llseek() (well NTFS uses it anyway but many other fs which switched to 
generic_file_llseek() do the same). This exclusion is necessary IMHO.
->readdir() may well blow up or at the very least give "completely 
outlandish results" if someone modifies f_pos while it is running. 
Depending on when exactly it happens, ntfs_readdir() is going to be ok as 
it mostly sets f_pos instead of incrementing it but still, a succeeding 
->llseek(), may actually end up in a different position to the one 
requested because of a concurrent ->readdir().
I know doing the two things at the same time requires a completely crazy 
multithreaded application, but then again many application developers fall 
into that category. (-;

I believe it can also happen if ->llseek() is allowed to run concurrently 
with a ->readdir()...
