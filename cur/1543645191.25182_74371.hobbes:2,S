Umm.. you sure?
Isn't putting this logic to routes an oversimplification?
Consider e.g. a dummy host which only have a few address (link-local,
site-local, global; the last two /64's) and, basically, a default route
(plus of course an interface routes for those /64's).
When talking to other subnets within the site (ie. those not on the /64)  
one would have difficulties parsing the source address from the default
route, as there would have to be at least two candidates there.
Am I missing something obvious here?
Alexey's approach should work in some simpler cases, but maybe not all
(stuff that's network prefix -independent like home addresses, privacy
addresses etc. would be different).
