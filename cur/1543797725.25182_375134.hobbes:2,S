Dear Arjun,
Thanks for your quick response
After I compiled the kernel, I verified the 'initrd-2.6.12.img' and it was present. 
But it is 10000 bytes less than the initial FC4 initrd img.
I did the following steps to build the kernel:
Copied the existing '.config' file from the old kernel and copied to the 2.6.12 kernel base directory.
Then,
# make
# make modules
# make modules_install
# make install
Is there is any thing additional needed for building the kernels in 2.6.x kernels?
I verified the support for inbuilt ext3 too and its present too.
What else could be the problem area?
Thanks & Regards,
Mukund Jampala

you forgot to make an initrd.
