Device: IBM-DTLA-307075 Serial Number: YSDYSFA5874
LBA 0 DMA Read Test                      = 45.73 MB/Sec (5.47 Seconds)
Outer Diameter Sequential DMA Read Test  = 35.85 MB/Sec (6.97 Seconds)
Inner Diameter Sequential DMA Read Test  = 17.62 MB/Sec (14.19 Seconds)
Sorry I do not have the other boxes configured with a kernel to accept
this test callout.
However I do have systems that rip at 63 MB/Sec and if you adjust for
CR3's between kernel to user-space it comes out to about 93 MB/Sec.
There is nothing LAME or LACKING about that performance!
