It's not about ownership.  It's about disclosure and common sense.
If someone reports something to you in private, and you disclose it
publically (or even privately to someone else) without first discussing
that with them, you'll lose their confidence.  Consequently they won't
be so kind to give you forewarning next time.

Licensing is irrelevant.  Like it or not, the person who is discovering
the bugs has some say in how you deal with the information.  It's in our
best interest to work nicely with these folks, not marginalize them.
