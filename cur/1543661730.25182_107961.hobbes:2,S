So you have the choice of either sticking to the solution which was 
previously used (only that it's now done in the kernel, not in modutils), 
or doing something new and more efficient.
Now, what's the reason you're not happy with that? You've got more
flexibility than before, and you can even switch between different ways
without having to teach an external package about it, so you avoid the
compatibility issues when kernel and modutils are not in sync.
