Looking good to me, Davide.  I think you've nailed everything there
except:
- Do we want to introduce new list macros, or change epoll a little
  to use the existing list manipulators (I think the latter)
- Do we keep the vmalloc, replace it with alloc_pages() or go all the
  way and remove the hash table?
  Seems that you're leaning toward the final option but either way,
  it would be best to get that vmalloc out of there - it's basically
  hit-or-miss for anything larger than a single page - for a really
  robust implementation it is best to avoid its use.
