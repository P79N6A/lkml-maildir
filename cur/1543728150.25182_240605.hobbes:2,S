Yes, I've read this whole thread. ...and I know, too, what amount of
hard work is required to get patches upstream. It's a *lot* more work
than needed to actually implement the chance beforehand.

Get real. Most people actually *use* distros, and many of them actually
*fail* to put the bugs into the distro's BTS. Instead, the author (or
whomever they think is the author) is written to. And guess? And I can
well imaging that Jörg doesn't like getting complains about hacked
cdrecord versions because people fail to *read* that this isn't a "pure"
incarnation.

Actually, I use Debian since, um, long ago:)  But accept that Jörg
doesn't really like to care about f*cked up patched versions of
cdrecord.  And right, that's a completely different topic compared to
possible bugs/non-documented APIs etc. Jörg is complaining about.
