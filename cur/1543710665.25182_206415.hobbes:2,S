Hm, without open source drivers, the Intel stack doesn't seem very
viable, correct?

Former kernel subsystem maintainers?  I did not realize that.

We constantly change the kernel.  Look at the USB stack.  It has been
rewritten completely almost 3 times now.  Did anyone really notice
besides the wonderful speed improvements?  :)
We never have to "live with a solution forever."

There have been numerous closed source IB stacks for Linux.  Just like
there were numerous Bluetooth stacks for Linux in the past.  Over time
the closed ones are weeded out as everyone relies on the in-kernel one.

What are the issues with the OpenIB stack?  If there are any, how does
the Intel stack solve those issues?  Could the Intel solutions be merged
into the OpenIB stack to solve these issues?

I understand your frustrations, I've been there before.
Good luck,
