I realize this group usually deal with technical issues, but I haven't
been able to find answers by searching. I appologize in advance if I'm
in the wrong place :)
Is there a Kernel-Patching Mini HOWTO, or something to that affect? I
have been trying to patch my 2.2.5 kernel to 2.2.10 and it can't get it
to patch cleanly. I haven't really seen any newbie level docs as far as
patching the kernel, so if anyone could suggest some required reading, I
would appreciate it.
Thanks,
Ron Brinker
