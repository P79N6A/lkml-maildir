Is that actually correct? If the program disassociates itself from the
controlling terminal between here and the kernel lock in
do_tty_hangup, will tty still be valid, and will it be owned by this
process?
Please keep the lock here - this system call is very rare (typ. once
per tty allocation) so deferring taking the kernel lock for a few
microseconds will have negligable affect on system performance.
