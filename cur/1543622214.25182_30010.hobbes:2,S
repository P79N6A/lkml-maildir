Subject: [PATCH] only irq-safe atomic ops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/2/23/15

The following patch implements i386 versions of atomic_inc and
atomic_dec that are LOCK-less but provide IRQ-atomicity and act as a
memory-barrier.
An applicable use would be data that needs to be IRQ-safe but not
SMP-safe (or, more likely, is already SMP-safe for some other reason).
Additionally, these variants could prevent having to use
preempt_disable/enable or "full" atomic ops around per-CPU data with a
preemptible kernel.
The patch is against 2.5.5.  Enjoy,
	Robert Love
