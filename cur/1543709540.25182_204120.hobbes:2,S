Not true, in the 3:1 split every process has its own
mm_struct and they all happen to share the top GB with
kernel stuff.  You can do a copy_to_user on multiple
CPUs efficiently.

True, there are some other operations.  However, when
you consider the fact that copy-user operations are
needed for so many things they are the big bottleneck.
Making it possible to copy things to and from userspace
in a lockless way will help performance quite a bit...
