I seem to have worked around it for now.  I've jumpered the hardware
to stop it from echoing what you transmit back locally and all seems
OK now.

I can test it yes, but 2.5 may be a bit too unstable for our
production use ATM.
Anyway I'll test out a 2.5 kernel when I'm back in the office
tomorrow, I can devote some time to tracking down the problem if you
can give me some pointers on where to start.  I'd like to be able to
feel confident that this will work reliably under 2.4, otherwise I
guess I need to look for alternate solutions.
Thanks for your help,
