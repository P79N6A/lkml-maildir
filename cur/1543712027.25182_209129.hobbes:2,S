I don't recall seeing this requirement mentioned before, and that's a ton
of patches you have there.
Please tell us a little more about why we need these patches.  (Apart from
what seems to be a moderate amount of code consolidation).
Also, what is different between __setup and __early_setup?  Why is it not
possible to make __setup run sufficiently early for whatever application is
requiring these changes?
Thanks.
