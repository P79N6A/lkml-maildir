Have you checked that your patch doesn't deadlock on ia64?

Stopping all vm operations means that copy_{to,from}_user can cause
deadlocks.
ia64 needs copy_to_user in their stack unwind handler, IIRC called by
ELF_CORE_COPY_REGS.
Afaics you don't handle that. You must dump all thread state before
down_write(mmap_sem). And I don't see how you protect against 2 threads
of one process calling suspend_threads() simultaneously.
