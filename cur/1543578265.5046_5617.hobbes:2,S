Hmm, /me is quite happy with it.  It's fine for *big* chunks of memory like
video frames:  I just need a large number of pages, length and offset.  If
someone wants to have a look: a rewritten bttv version which uses kiobufs
is available at 
http://www.strusel007.de/linux/bttv/bttv-0.8.8.tar.gz
It does _not_ use kiovecs throuth (to be exact: kiovecs with just one single
kiobuf in there).

What happens with big memory blocks?  Do all pages but the first and last
get offset=0 and length=PAGE_SIZE then?
