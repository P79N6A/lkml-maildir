   [Same as the CDROM bug listed earlier I think]
The bug report said that it was verified under both SCSI and ATAPI MO,
and that uses a different driver than the SCSI CD-ROM code, I think....
(Speaking of which, Jens Axboe said he was going to fix the SCSI-CDROM
driver to work on filesystems less than 2k --- i.e. 1k ext2 filesystems,
since this worked under 2.2.  Has this gotten fixed yet?)
