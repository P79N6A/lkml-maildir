Good point. But the signal_pending() check after that interruptible
sleep (which deterministically comes after this one) takes care of the
break, doesn't it? I guess you can (maybe already have done so...) get
rid of the signal_pending() check after the uninterruptible sleep. And
then go ahead and make this an msleep(10) call  and the other one (in
the same function) an msleep_interruptible() call ;)
Thanks,
