Reconnect patches are merely an extension of serio_rescan mechanism - the
only difference is that reconnect tries to keep the same input device if
the hardware didn't change. It does not care about any hierarchy, it just
a way for someone to try to re-initialize driver (probably the driver 
itself). I for example never suspend, but my docking station resets the
touch pad back to relative mode. With reconnect it is possible to dock
and undock with X and GPM running and it will not screw your input 
devices (rescan would create brand new input devices while X and GPM still
use old ones).
The pass-through support of all things implements device hierarchy in non 
driver-model way and you just included it. The entire input subsystem is not 
based on the driver model at the moment.. Are there plans to change it in 2.6
timeframe? If not for 2.6 then I would ask you to reconsider, reconnect will
make life of users much easier. If you have something in works could I have a
peek so I could probably adjust my patches.
BTW, is it possible with current driver model to reinitialize an arbitrary 
device, not entire bus?
