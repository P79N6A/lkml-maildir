Yeah.  This patch held up against the simple testing, as did Nick's (not
the most recent combined one from him).
Here's some sample output from annotation I added:
balance_pgdat:1050: zone->DMA present_pages == 0
balance_pgdat:1050: zone->DMA present_pages == 0
balance_pgdat:1050: zone->DMA present_pages == 0
balance_pgdat:1050: zone->DMA present_pages == 0
balance_pgdat:1013: zone->DMA present_pages == 0
balance_pgdat:1050: zone->DMA present_pages == 0
balance_pgdat:1050: zone->DMA present_pages == 0

thanks,
