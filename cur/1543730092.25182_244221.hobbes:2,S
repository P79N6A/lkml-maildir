At least older XFree86 (4.2/3 time frame) used to only use iopl(). I
know it because at some point ioperm() was completely broken on
x86-64, but the X server never hit it. I wonder why they changed
that. Anyways, perhaps it would be better to just change the X server
back to use iopl(), because it will be always faster than using
ioperm.
