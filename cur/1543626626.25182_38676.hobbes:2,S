OK, I could, so I searched back and -pre1 was OK.  This behavior
showed up in -pre2.  It seems to be related to the mm changes.
Unfortunately I don't know how to back those out safely to check that.
To repeat, I set up a window that has to be redrawn (no backing
store), then use ee (electric eyes) to scroll through 50 or so JPGs
then go back to redraw the aforementioned window.  In -pre2 I get 5
sec freezes and no disk IO during the interval, so it seems like a
memory management thing.
Any tests I could do?  A -pre2 patch without the mm changes?
