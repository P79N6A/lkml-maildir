Due to restrictions of the ISA-Bus (where DMA actually came from), only
the first
16 MB can be allocated. In linux, dma transfers can be max. 64k at once.
However some application/other DMA device leaches this memory area, so
allocation
isn't possible.

When you have around 96M RAM you should upgrade to linux 2.2.x (last
stable 2.2.5).
Memory management is more efficient here. You don't need to apply the
awedrv patch,
for AWE-support is included in 2.2.5. Maybe you don't need portfw-ftp,
too, because
2.2.5 supports IP-Port-forwarding.
Maybe someone can say about the other patches?
