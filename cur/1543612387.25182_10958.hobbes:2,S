Do not comment code by //. Kill if it you want to.
You added clean way to stop nbd. Good.
DO NOT USE ALL CAPITALS not even in printks().
Fix those and patch looks ike good idea for 2.5.
Look at nbd.sf.net. If you have patches against that, mail them to me. If 
you are willing to co-develop stuff at nbd.sf.net, I guess we can arrange
something.
