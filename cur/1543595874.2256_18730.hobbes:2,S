    I found that the kmap_high function didn't call __flush_tlb_one()
when it mapped a highmem page sucessfully, and I think it maybe
cause the problem that TLB may store obslete page table entries, but
the kmap_atomic() function do call the __flush_tlb_one(), someone tell
me what's the differenc between the kmap_atomic and kmap_high except
that kmap_atomic can be used in IRQ contexts. I appreciate in advance.
