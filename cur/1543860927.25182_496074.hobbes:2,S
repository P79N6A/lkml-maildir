Also, the output is weird in that the "contention_events" should be
a total of all of the events in the first three columns. Clearly the
number is wrong and I don't know if the text output was mangled or
if that's accurate and my code is buggy. I have yet to see it give
me data like that yet in my set up.
The fourth and fifth columns are the number of times this lock was
initialized inline by a function like spin_lock_init(). It might
have a correspondence to clone() calls.
