  We  already had the examples with cp and mv. Both should continue to
  work and the files will still be copied. The same with Konqueror and
  Nautilus.  Files  and  their  meta-files/streams/attributes  will be
  retained as long as applications are using the OS API.
  However,  if  things  are  to  implemented  in  user-space, then old
  applications  will not work correctly and there is risk that all the
  extra information will be lost or corrupted.
  You  said  it  would be socially hard. I think it would be very much
  close to impossible to get it right. Imagine that Gnome and Nautilus
  would  implement  support  for  these. I doubt that cp, mv, KDE, mc,
  app-xyz  would  implement  this anytime soon and in the meantime the
  data is at risk.
  If  we  want  things  to  work  from  the  start, including with old
  applications  then  these  features  should  be at below-application
  level.  If  it  is  in VFS or FS doesn't matter to me, as long as it
  doesn't hinder or delay progress to long.
