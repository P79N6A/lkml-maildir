On my Sony Vaio with latest linux-2.6 git kernel it says its a CRT :
[~]> cat  /proc/acpi/video/*/*/info
device_id:    0x0100
type:         CRT
known by bios: no
device_id:    0x0320
type:         UNKNOWN
known by bios: no
device_id:    0x0410
type:         UNKNOWN
known by bios: no
device_id:    0x0240
type:         UNKNOWN
known by bios: no
device_id:    0x0100
type:         CRT
known by bios: no
device_id:    0x0111
type:         UNKNOWN
known by bios: no
device_id:    0x0118
type:         UNKNOWN
known by bios: no
device_id:    0x0200
type:         TVOUT
known by bios: no
So I don't think its reliable.
