Here's three patches, in order. The first adds getfiles and
Makefile.repo. It will pull all files needed from BK, except for the
Kconfig files.
The second adds support for Kconfig files.
The third is just some comsetic cleanups to cut chatter during
non-verbose builds.

There is a bit of overhead, but mainly for files that are not there. If
the file has already been checked out, and the SCCS file is not newer,
then getfiles will not be run. There is the matter of an extra stat()
call, though, to figure that out.
For me, since I am working in a NFS directory, this is much faster than
doing a "bk -r get; make bzImage" because it only pulls the files needed
to build my kernel configuration. Even on a local disk, it "feels"
faster, though I'm sure I do not see as much of a benefit.
Code wise, yeah, it is more overhead, and it could be potentially
fragile in regards to compiler messages in the getfiles script.
