This might explain the crashes I've seen in my routers but been unable
to capture so far (and without the extra slab debugging I don't know if
I would have been able to find it or even get a decent capture...)
Patch attached that should fix the problem, not tested or even compiled.
Joe, can you please please test it and report back?

You are correct. It was a list_del() that caused it (at least I think
so, it's 2am right now).
1. conntrack helper adds an expectation and adds that to a list hanging
of off a connection.
2. the expected connection arrives. the expectation is still on the
list.
3. the original connection that caused the expectation terminates but
the expectation still thinks it's added to the list.
4. the expected connection terminates and list_del() is called to remove
it from the list which doesn't exist anymore. boom!

This will be a nice feature, might make it easier to find the bugs.
Too bad it can't help work out the relationship between structs... I had
to use pen and paper to work out the relationship between connections
and expectations :) That part is almost a little bit hairy.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
