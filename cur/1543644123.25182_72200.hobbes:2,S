Great! Where does this leave NGPT though? I had assumed that
this was going to be the next pthread implementation in glibc.

Hey guys,
I noticed you're looking at threading stuff lately,
and was wondering about this thread:
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/bug-glibc/2001-12/msg00048.html
In summary wouldn't it be better to have a per process
flag that was only set when pthread_create() is called.
If the flag is not set, then you don't need to do locking.
This locking seems to have huge overhead. For e.g. I
patched uniq in textutils to use getc_unlocked() rather
than getc() and got a 300% performance increase!
cheers,
Pádraig.
