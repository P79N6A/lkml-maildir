Good compilers even in the 1990's would defer the divide and try and
propogate it out as a multiply the other side for constants, and they'll
also use shifts when possible.
Thus they'll turn
	(ptr.element - base.element) < NELEM
into
	(ptr.char - base.char) < (constant) [NELEM *sizeof(element) ]
at least for constant operations. Dunno if gcc is that clever
