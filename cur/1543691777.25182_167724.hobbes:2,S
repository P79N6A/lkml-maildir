You get bogus results

8 ISA cycles will be nice and safe - see the specification for the ISA
bus. Its a nice easy known value and the way we moved various drivers to
udelay that used isa delay cycles for timing loops

Delaying too long is ok, delaying too little isnt good but as you say
most modern hw seems not to care.
