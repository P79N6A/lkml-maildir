You can always divide the patch into bug fix and feature addition.
The bug fix goes to mainline, the feature addition goes into trial.
It's also easier to spot regressions if you divide the patch into
logical parts. For example, the recent atyfb update was composed of
10 different patches, each doing 1 logical thing.

Well yes.  But this is a fast path that will affect performance.  And the
check will tend to hide bugs than reveal them (though you do have a printk
function).  And thirdly, cfb_imageblit does not support scan_align != 1.

It's the same code whether you use scan_align of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. So,
I still don't see any benefit. You even confused akpm et al at what it does,
why you need to cast with u32. (It's because the accelerator needs u32
values, but supporting scan_align 1 and 2 means the bitmap becomes aligned
at u8 and u16 boundaries).

No, it's the property of the accelerator.

That has always been the (not often followed) rule - Round up if you can,
return -EINVAL if you can't.  Because with most user apps, finding the best
mode involves many iterations of FB_ACTIVATE_TEST, so that particular method
will be speeded up if you give working values rather than -EINVAL.  And yes,
properly working fb apps will check the contents of fb_var_screeninfo even if
the check_var returns success.
If your user will set something crazy like 799x600, might as well give him
an 800x600. As long as you use values that are higher than requested,
it won't hurt.
