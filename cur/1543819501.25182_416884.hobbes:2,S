There's a reason for this (this has actually been covered and discussed
at length in the past on the linux-arm mailing lists.)
Folk convinced me that the only thing which we should call "architecture"
is the CPU - so things like "PPC", "ARM", "i386" are architectures, and
not implementations of these (AT91RM9200, S3C2410).
The things in arch/arm/mach* are machine classes which support a variety
of machines which are all essentially similar.  Inside these directories
you have the core support for the individual machines.
However, the problem is that we can't rename include/asm-arm/arch-* to
include/asm-arm/mach-*, because we need a symlink to select the right
one.  If we renamed include/asm-arm/arch-* to include/asm-arm/mach-*,
we'd want the symlink to be called include/asm-arm/mach.
Unfortunately, we have an include/asm-arm/mach directory, so we'd end
up having to symlink include/asm-arm/mach-* to include/asm-arm/arch.
This would be even more confusing than leaving the include/asm-arm as
currently is.
