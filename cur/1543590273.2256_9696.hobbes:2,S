From the procps man page:
       Albert Cahalan <acahalan@cs.uml.edu> rewrote ps  for  full
       Unix98  and  BSD  support,  along with some ugly hacks for
       obsolete and foreign syntax.
       Michael K. Johnson <johnsonm@redhat.com>  is  the  current
       maintainer.
Michaels' ftp for procps is at

Jim
