If someone wrote the code then yes. Basically it comes down to ensuring
that the total amount of address space is contained
Doing it perfectly is hard - very hard and I've yet to see anyone get it
right in the Unix world. Doing the general case is not so bad. Basically
whenever you create/destroy/modify a VMA you must ensure that there is
memory or swap for the VMA.
