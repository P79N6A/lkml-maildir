What are you guys talking about?  ;)
The linux-smp list is alive and well.  It was hosted by vger.rutgers.edu
along with l-k and others; perhaps that death is what you're thinking of? 
linux-smp is avail now from vger.kernel.org.  It's not terribly high
volume, but various notes-comparing about hardware compatability, etc goes
on steadily.
