Our config here has been several (ok, two) Epox EP-ZX370A based 
machines with Celeron PPGA processors, atapi disk/cdroms on same 
controller. Vanilla Slackware 7 (2.2.13) installs.

In one of our machines, the install would mostly hang due to fs-corruption. 
This machine was subjected to a complete hardware replacement (everything 
but the chassis), and the fault was found to be on the AGP-card (Matrox 
G200). The problems persisted after the card was replaced, but did not show 
up in Windows, nor during a night-long RAM stress-test.
The other would seem stable for quite some time of use (normal desktop 
workstation), before thrashing the filesystem.
Both installs were performed the same way we usually do them, so I don't 
really think it was user error  :-)
After replacing the power supplies, both machines now seem stable - one 
still used as a desktop, the other is not used.

On a hunch I just now performed an extensive set of cd->hd writes against a 
filesystem, with multiple cp's running at the same time. The filesystem is 
44.5% fragmented now, but still intact. Altho this test is inconclusive, I'd 
have thought that any errors occuring due to cdrom reads during disk writes 
should crop up now.
It seems that the only rational possibility is a flaky powersupply (we've been 
using Task TK-920TX's, which seem to die within three months of use).
Try to replace your psu with a 'name' brand, and see if that helps.
Yours,
