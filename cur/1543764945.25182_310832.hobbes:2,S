Good --- I think I've got the debugging solid against 2.4 for that case,
patching against 2.6 now.

Exactly.

In the leak case we're worried about, the buffers are dirty but the page
is anon so there's nothing to clean them up.  The buffers _will_ be
destroyed by unmount, sure; invalidate_bdev() should see to that.  But
I'm doing the bh leak check before we get to the final
invalidate_bdev(), so they should still be available for testing at that
point.
