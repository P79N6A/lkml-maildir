It does, so why isn't there a way to do this without the disgusting
hack? (Your words, not mine :) )
E.g, wouldn't a aio_stat() allow simular or better speedups in a way
that doesn't depend on ext2/3 internals?
I bet it would make a significant difference from things like "ls -l" in
large uncached directories and imap-servers with maildir?
