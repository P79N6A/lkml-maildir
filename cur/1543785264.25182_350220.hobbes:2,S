This is why my original per-cpu allocator patch was damn slow, and
GFP_KERNEL only.  I wasn't convinced that high-churn objects are a good
fit for spreading across cpus.
I thought that net devices and modules (which uses a primitive
hard-coded "bigref" currently) were a fair uses for bigrefs, though I'd
like to see some stats.
Cheers,
Rusty.
