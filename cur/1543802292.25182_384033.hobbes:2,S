I'd ask you and Oleg to re-synchronize, and perhaps Oleg to re-send the 
(part of?) the series that has no debate. I'm unsure, for example, whether 
#2 was just to be dropped.
I already applied #1, and it looks like there's agreement on #3 and #4, 
but basically, just to make sure, can Oleg please re-send to make sure I 
got it right?
Getting a screwed-up RCU thing is going to be too painful to debug, so I'd 
rather get it right the first time it hits my tree..
