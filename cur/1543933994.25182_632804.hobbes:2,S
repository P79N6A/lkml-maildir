It's not a bit deal.
inflate.c is #include'd with different depth "../" prefixes.
Currently, depths 1, 3, 4 and 5 are used.
It seemed neater to take this inflate.c file, which can not
be stand-alone compiled, and move it to somewhere on the
include path so that it may be included via #include <inflate.c>
I was originally trying to make each file in a directory via
for file in $(ls lib/*.c) ; do file=${file%.c}.o ; make $file ; done
and I noticed that inflate.o wasn't made.
cheers, Joe
