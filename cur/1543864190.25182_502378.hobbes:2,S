There is no hard and fast rule.  If the patch is obvious and submitted 
in correct form (Andrew's notifications are not in such a form), then I 
might go ahead and apply it.  But I usually reply to the patch with 
"applied" if so.
In general, you can answer this question yourself.  Look at 
netdev-2.6.git#atl1 and see what's in there.
