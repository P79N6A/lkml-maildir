This is different bug:
- bug 1 is access user space without the functions from <asm/uaccess.h>, 
or access user space after set_fs(KERNEL_DS), or access kernel space 
without set_fs(KERNEL_DS).
- bug 2 is not enough access_ok() calls, e.g. __put_user without a 
preceeding access_ok() check, either explicit or implicit due to an 
copy_from_user().
