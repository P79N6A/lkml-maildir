Yep, exactly about above open/kevent_ctl I'm talking.
I still have a system which has ioctl() based kevent setup, and it
works - I really do not want to rise another flamewar about which
approach is better. If no one will complain until tomorrow I will commit
it.

There were implementation with pure ioctl() and with one syscall for all
oprations (and control block embedded in it), all were rejected in
favour of two syscalls, so I'm waiting for your patches.
