You know that Debian's kernel-package tool does something similar? IIRC,
add-on modules install source in /usr/src/modules/<pkgname>, and make-kpkg
walks over that directory when building the kernel. I expect it relies on the
add-on modules packages' debian-specific scripts, but it might be worth a 
look. It might also be worth looking in the package list to see which modules
are packaged like that, as a start for your list.
