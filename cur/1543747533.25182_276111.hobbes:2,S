Design by contract isn't really an agreement between the caller and the 
callee (which may not even exist when the contract is created).  It's 
more of a (one way) promise by the callee that if the interface is used 
as described in the contract that it will correctly perform the 
advertised operation (where the advertised operation generally includes 
descriptions of possible failures and how they will be signalled).  Most 
C APIs meet these criteria even though their pre and post conditions are 
expressed less formally than an Eiffel interface.

I agree but think it's important to realize that it's a unilateral 
promise on the part of the callee (rather than agreement between the 
callee and the caller) which is in accord with Linus's view of the ABI.
