1) This is a semantic change.  Of course using down_interruptible()
without checking the return value is almost certainly a bug, but have
you thought about whether returning ERESTARTSYS is correct here?  If
you have, then please include the reasoning in your patch description.
(Another possibility would be to just use an uninterruptible mutex_lock())
2) The coding style for the if statement is not quite right.  The
correct way is to do
	if (condition)
		one_liner;
(note the space between the 'if' and the '(', and no braces used)
 - R.
