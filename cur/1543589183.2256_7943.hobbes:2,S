Not to mention fold up keyboard, IBM microdrive, etc.  So you
can run the ARM Debian distro either via NFS (with the problems that
entails), or even locally on a microdrive (or I suppose you could
also play with an IDE or SCSI controller if you were really insane).
On the kernel software side, we also have IPV6/mobile IP running.  We're
using Dave Woodhouse's JFFS2 with compression for our file system (Compressed
journalling flash file system) on flash.
In terms of apps, various PIM stuff, though needs lots of work,
other goodies like GPS applications, etc.  Mozilla in previous versions
has been known to work.  Tons of games, doom, etc.
MP3 players (at least 3).  Gnome core libraries.
Python, Java 2 standard edition, swing, all running etc..... 
Lots of work/fun left to do, of course, in all areas.
Shall we just say we're having lots and lots and lots of fun :-).
These are real computers.
Lots of dust in the air: lots should have settled by June.  In particular,
look at the Familiar work.
See www.handhelds.org.  I apologize about the state of our web site:
I've done much of the maintenance in the past, but I've been out for some
surgery and life has been insane ever since.  Most of the interesting
stuff is in the Wiki.  And iPAQ's are not as unobtanium as they once were:
we're in really high volume production (>100K/month) but demand still
outstrips supply (sigh...).
Come join the party...
