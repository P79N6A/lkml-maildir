Well, I have multiple I/O threads for many other types of I/O that don't have any problems. 
And until these changes in 2.6.18 I didn't have any problems with the floppy. I have multiple
ethernet threads, multiple scsi (SG) device threads, multiple rs232 device threads, parallel port, 
and others, no problem??

I don't mean to sound stupid but why would a process running on processor 1 require anything
from events/2 when there is an events/1? Forgive my ignorance please.

Again I don't understand why flush_scheduled_work() running on behalf of a process
affinitized to processor-1 requires cooperation from events/2 (affinitized to processor-2)
when there is an events/1 already affinitized to processor 1? Again though, Forgive my 
ignorance please.

The patch you sent helps with no other intervention from me. But then so does 
the patch mentioned in the original post.  I am able to bang on the floppies pretty
hard doing all kinds of things with no trouble using either. 
As far as a 100% cpu-bound RT-process goes, well I say I don't intentionally relinquish
the processor but it's not really 100% cpu-bound. Running xosview I see some spare time. 
Thanks
