Patch below (against 2.6.11-rc3, applies at offset to 2.6.10) fixes
the unmap_hugepage_range BUGs I could generate: does it fix yours?
Hugh
The hugetlb_page test in do_munmap is too permissive.  It checks start
vma, but forgets that end vma might be different and huge though start
is not: so hits unmap_hugepage_range BUG if misaligned end was given.
And it's too restrictive: munmap has always succeeded on unmapped areas
within its range, why should it behave differently near a hugepage vma?
And the additional checks in is_aligned_hugepage_range are irrelevant
here, when the hugepage vma already exists.  But the function is still
required (on some arches), as the default for prepare_hugepage_range -
leave renaming cleanup to another occasion.
