By initrd I assume you mean the driver is loaded as a module from
initrd?  modprobe/insmod require that the module and kernel have the
same version number (ignoring redhat version numbers like -3) or that
both the module and kernel be compiled with symbol versions and the
checksums must match for all symbols in the module.
Bottom line, loading a binary module from kernel a.b.c into kernel
x.y.z is not safe unless the checksums are present and still match.
You can force the load with "insmod -f" but that is usually a case of
"gun, meet foot - gun, shoot foot".
