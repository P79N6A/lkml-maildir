FWIW I think both points are valid.
Personally I find it difficult to completely stop what I'm doing 
and spend several days studying a large patch/complete new subsystem.
But on the other hand it's important that code that goes in the kernel 
gets a proper review, I think we all come to rely on the gatekeepers job
of making sure any given part of the kernel does not destabilize to the 
point were it interferes with our individual areas of development.
So exactly what level of granularity is appropriate  for changes? Well
that should probably be left of to the gatekeeper for each particular
area. In the case of filesystems generic vfs changes obviously need to 
be small and easy to digest, and more importantly easy to bisect
regressions. The core of the file system can be left to the person who
can best manage the code, but hopefully that person applies a reasonable
of granularity to the changes, thus allowing non familiar developers to
at least keep up and possibly make helpful suggestions.
If we look at the current "beliefs" surrounding XFS you can see the
affects of a code base that did not have an incremental development with
regards to linux anyways. Ok so ya XFS was a close sourced IRIX FS for
the first 8 years of it's life, and even once the Linux project started
there was another year or so encumbrance investigation and cleaning
before legal would sign off on its release.
So to this day the major hang up with XFS seems to be "it's to complex
because it has x thousands lines of code".  Hell by that argument Linux
has way more lines of code than IRIX could ever hope to have and is
therefore Linux is more complex than IRIX and to hard to understand. :-)
Fortunately many developers (especially ones that have worked on other
OS's) do not use "wc -l" as a tool to measure code
quality/readability/complexity. 
XFS unfortunately will probably always suffer from skepticism since
it did not grow up in in Linux.
Guess it's sort of like adopting a 8 year old child vs a new born, hard
to tell what happened in first 8 years.
