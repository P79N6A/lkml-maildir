These are pretty significant results. Maybe its best to use non-temporal
stores in general for clearing pages? I checked and Itanium has always
used non-temporal stores. So there will be no benefit for us from this
approach (we have 16k and 64k page sizes which may make the situation a
bit different). Try to update the i386 architectures to do the same?
Or for prezeroing, you could register a zeroing driver that would use the
non-temporal stores with V8 of the prezeroing patches. In any case the
clear_pages patch is not useful the way it was intended for us and I am
have dropped this from the prezeroing patch.
