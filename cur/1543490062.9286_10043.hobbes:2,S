	At all.... just THIS mouse model has a non-working wheel on X...
I suffer on it :-( I've been in contact with XFree people to solve this, but
not answer yet. Sorry
	Anyway, there is a limited wheel support on X: just emulating a 
Z axis or mapping Z axis to mouse buttons... People is working in allowing
a more usefull approach ( especifically mapping wheel to anything not just
buttons )

	Perhaps a gpm problem... i've tried immps2 type but doesn't work
think that is a logitech special extension not yet supported
