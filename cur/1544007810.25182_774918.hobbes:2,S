it does not trigger with an Alpha defconfig - we do test that.
And the thing is, lockdep (which introduced irqflags tracing) has been 
introduced upstream two years ago - and Alpha still does not have it 
implemented. The architecture should be marked CONFIG_BROKEN if it 
continues to cause problems like this.
Alexey, you seem to be using and relying on the Alpha architecture, could 
you please have a shot at this and implement the missing irqflags 
infrastructure? Thanks,
