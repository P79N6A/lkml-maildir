No this was just the first message - I've removed disk from drive
several times - the basic problem was, that after first mount 
I've copyied one file to the zip drive and then I've made 'ls' on
directory and the file was missing (file has name 'ne'). Then I've tried
to copy
the same file there again and I've got the message that file is already
there. I've unmounted zip device and I'was unable to mount the
zip drive back again until I've reinserted ppa module.
Anyway after this the zip drive was empty and vfat table was cleared.
There were no such problems with 2.2.18 kernel.
