That's true (OTOH I'd argue it would still be very useful for things
like pagecache, so one container can't start a couple of 'dd' loops
and turn everyone else to crap). And while the sharing may not be
exactly captured, statistically things should balance over time.
So I'm not arguing about _also_ accounting resources that are limited
in other ways (than just the RAM they consume).
But as a DoS protection measure on RAM usage, trying to account all
kernel allocations that are user triggerable just sounds hard to
maintain, holey, ugly, invsive (and not perfect either -- in fact it
still isn't clear to me that it is any better than my proposal).

If it isn't interesting, then I don't think we want it (at least, until
someone does get an interest in it).

Yeah that's fair enough. We obviously want to avoid exposing limits on
things that it doesn't make sense to limit, or that is a kernel
implementation detail as much as possible.
eg. so I would be happy to limit virtual address, less happy to limit
vmas alone (unless that is in the context of accounting their RAM usage
or their implied vaddr charge).
