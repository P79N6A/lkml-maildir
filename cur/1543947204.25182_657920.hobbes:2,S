*Argh*, this bug is not behaving nicely :( Whatever happened,
git-current now suspends correctly with and without CONFIG_SMP  and all
may CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y and CONFIG_CLASSIC_RCU=y attempts. Also no sata
errors anymore.
However it is not reliably waking up (at least when all of the above
except CLASSIC_RCU is on). Sometimes the display remains black on the
console, but X still works and sometimes it hangs completely on resume.
Also when compiling these many kernels via make -j4 I noted that I could
hardly move the mouse / use the keyboard, but saw random jumps and
key-repetitions...
