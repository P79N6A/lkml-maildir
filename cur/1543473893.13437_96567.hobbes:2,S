The order shouldn't matter.  Things should be arranged so that regardless of 
whether lp loads before parport_pc or after, it will work.
If this is reproducible, can you give exact details of what you have to do to 
provoke it, what modules are loaded at the point it fails to work and what 
`dmesg' says then.
