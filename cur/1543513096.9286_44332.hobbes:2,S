	Hello Linus,
	I have written (a read only at the moment) BFS filesystem for Linux and
	placed tha patch on:
	
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/bfs-2.3.21.patch
	I cc'd Andries
I haven't seen anything. No surprise, seeing the phantasy address you invented.
Tigran, you are a strange and sneaky person.
	because I know that he has written (independently) a similar thing.
	I hope you will consider including it in the 2.3.x series.
A third independent implementation of bfs was done by Martin Hinner
<mhi@linux.gyarab.cz>.
	Regards,
	Tigran.
	PS. For those who don't know what BFS is - it is the filesystem type used
	for mounting /stand slice on SCO UnixWare systems.
So we have three versions right now:
Martin Hinner's at 
http://www.penguin.cz/~mhi/fs/bfs/
 .
Mine at 
ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/aeb/bfs/
 .
Tigran's - see above.
I'll compare one of these days and report.
