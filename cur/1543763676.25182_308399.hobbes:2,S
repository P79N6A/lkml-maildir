Dear Joern,
I meant that JFFS2 always reads by portions of PAGE_SIZE bytes due to 
the Page Cache. Consequently, nodes cotaining the peaces of the same 
page don't have to be independently uncompressible. Yes, there are some 
difficulties. But this is off-topic anyway and I don't think it is worth 
to discuss this here :-)
