You implementation of these is private to hpet.c.  From what Jeff is
saying, it looks like it should be in include/asm-i386/io.h?
#ifndef readq
static unsigned long long __inline readq(void *addr)
{
	return readl(addr) | (((unsigned long long)readl(addr + 4)) << 32LL);
}
#endif
#ifndef writeq
static void __inline writeq(unsigned long long v, void *addr)
{
	writel(v & 0xffffffff, addr);
	writel(v >> 32, addr + 4);
}
#endif
