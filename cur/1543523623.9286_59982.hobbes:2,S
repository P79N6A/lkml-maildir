Applying the change to the page fault handler might just be the right
thing to do, and in fact it would make sense in 2.3 to have the fault
handler also switch to lazy tlb mode if the task has to perform io.  The
fault handler does neither of these things right now, and in fact this was
causing occasional stuck tasks if the fault ended up calling schedule
before changing current->state.
