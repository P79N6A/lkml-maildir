Subject: kernel.org: Extended downtime announcement

Precedence: bulk

In order to make the best use of available space, we will unfortunately
have to reconfigure the RAID arrays on the main kernel.org server.  This
will result in extended downtime for all kernel.org services, starting
at 16:00 PST/24:00 UTC this evening, March 17, 2003.  For
ftp/www/rsync/filehub.kernel.org, this downtime should be in the
ballpark of 2-3 hours; with luck less; for mirrors.kernel.org, this
downtime is expected to be 3-4 days.  Services will be phased in as they
become available, so if you get a "connection refused" from one service
other services might still be operational.
Hopefully this will be reasonably painless.
