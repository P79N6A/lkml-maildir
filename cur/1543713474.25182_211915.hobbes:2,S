This is weird, it sounds like something is reusing page->private for
slab pages in ppc, how that can be possible?
Can you also double check that this is not reproducible on x86 just in

can you try again with compound on and the debugging patch I posted that
replicates page->private into page->mapping to verify it's only
page->private being corrupt?
thanks for the help.
