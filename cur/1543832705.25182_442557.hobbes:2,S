David Eger is the author, the last I heard from him was 2 years ago.
But I haven't received that many problem reports on cirrusfb.
However, changes that affect all drivers are my responsibility.

The only register touched by the i2c code is EEPROM control (CL_SEQR8).
This is never touched by the rest of the cirrusfb code. So I don't
think concurrent access is a problem (unless the hardware has restrictions
such as no other register accesses are allowed while this register is being
accessed). 
The framebuffer layer is serialized by
acquire_console_sem()/release_console_sem(). If you think concurrent access
is a problem, you can always use that.
