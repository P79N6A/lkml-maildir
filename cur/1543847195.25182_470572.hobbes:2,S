That's pretty much it in a nutshell...  Since most BIOS are largely 
tested and qualified only on That Other OS, Linux often gets the short 
end of the stick.  We have a long history of running into BIOS bugs, and 
having to work around them.  We've learned the hard way that programming 
the "bare metal" is often the only reliable way to get things done.
