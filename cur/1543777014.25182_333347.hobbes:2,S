The PIT crystal runs at 14.3181818 MHz (CGA dotclock, found on ISA, ...)
and is divided by 12 to get PIT tick rate
	14.3181818 MHz / 12 = 1193182 Hz
The reality is that the crystal is usually off by 50-100 ppm from the
standard value, depending on temperature. 
    HZ   ticks/jiffie  1 second      error (ppm)
---------------------------------------------------
   100      11932      1.000015238      15.2
   200       5966      1.000015238      15.2
   250       4773      1.000057143      57.1
   300       3977      0.999931429     -68.6
   333       3583      0.999964114     -35.9
   500       2386      0.999847619    -152.4
  1000       1193      0.999847619    -152.4
Some HZ values indeed fit the tick frequency better than others, up to
333 the error is lost in the physical error of the crystal, for 500 and
1000, it definitely is larger, and thus noticeable.
Some (less round and nice) values of HZ would fit even better:
    HZ   ticks/jiffie  1 second      error (ppm)
---------------------------------------------------
    82      14551      1.000000152       0.2
    96      12429      1.000001829       1.8
   209       5709      0.999999314      -0.7
   363       3287      0.999999314      -0.7
   519       2299      0.999999314      -0.7
   864       1381      1.000001829       1.8
