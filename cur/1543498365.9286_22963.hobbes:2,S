Another problem I ran into recently with the current major/minor
assignments.
i was attempting to put togeather an Informix server. I got a hardware
raid array with 54G of usable space. Informix prefers that this get cut
into 2G partitions (at least according to the informix DBA). This was not
possible to do without wither useing devfs or the developmental lvm code

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
