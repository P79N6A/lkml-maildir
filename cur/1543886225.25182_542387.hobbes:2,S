It's a bit rough that Jeff spent a large amount of time hunting down an
already-known bug.  That's normally my job :(
This five-week-old diff only ever appeared in 2.6.21-mm1, which was
released four days ago.  It was then whizzed into mainline.  We thus lost
five weeks public testing which would probably have saved Jeff his pain.
What went wrong?
