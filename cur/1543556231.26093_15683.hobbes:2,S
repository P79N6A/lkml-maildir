Linux distributes outgoing outgoing packets in a round robin manner.
Ciscos are supposed to do this based on the XOr value of the last two bits
of source AND destination MAC. 
I was astonished to see a Catalyst2924EN distribute traffic EITHER by
source OR by destination MAC address (configurable). 
My BayStack450 seems to do roind robin, too.
Ciscos MAC based distribution limits each TCP connection to 100 Mbps.

PS: Thanks to Willy for his work on the bonding driver.
