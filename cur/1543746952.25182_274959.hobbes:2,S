The problem with these (atomic.h, bitops.h, byteorder.h, div64.h,
list.h, spinlock.h, unaligned.h and xor.h) is that they provide
functionality that is needed by many user application but not
provided by the compiler or libc. 
While I agree that it is an absolutely evil concept to include
them from the kernel headers, we have to face that by not installing
them, lots of this existing evil user code will be broken even
more and someone has to pick up the pieces.
