I don't mean to be nasty, but the effect this has on readers, in spite
of the smiley, is that "Linux hasn't grown up yet if they find Ottawa so
much kewler than fixing a simple bug".  Meaning: the downside of public
discussion is that it's easy to be mistaken.
A serious suggestion is, providing that the arguments presented (people
busy with OLS preparations and long review queue for 2.6.17.N+1):
How about doing 2.6.17.7 as an interim release fixing just what is known
to be critical at the point of the release, and then review the rest for
2.6.17.8? That would nicely fit the release early, release often - users
like that particularly for bug fixes.
