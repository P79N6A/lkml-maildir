*cough*
I've been taught by every Maths, Engineering and Physics 
teacher/lecturer I've encountered to write down significant figures 
consistent with the precision of the value.  So blindly writing down 
a value of 59.42886726469 ±2°C is obviously ludicrous, even if that's 
what my calculator gives me.  I should instead write 59 ±2°C, since 
that is the most precision I can possibly know it to.  With some 
advanced measuring techniques it *may* be acceptable to write 59.43 
±2°C *at most*, and then only if you really know why you need the 
extra information.
The UK education system is one of the better ones available, and the 
above philosophy is consistently held throughout it.  I'd be well 
advised not to argue, especially since it's common sense.
