FUD and nonsense. I've written many DSP applications and very often I can 
recycle the same code for use in them. Here's an example, abstracted, 
commented, handling errors from the subsystem, in just over 100 LOC.

The API is really _only_ complicated because it expects you to set things OSS 
either can't handle or doesn't allow you to configure. Things that very often 
an application will eventually care about. All this for the sake of 5 minutes 
reading documentation, and each API call almost identical in design.
Personally, I found the lack of documentation for some of the setup API 
annoying, but it's since been rectified and each call is humanly 
understandable.
