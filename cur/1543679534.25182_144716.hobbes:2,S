never mind, I think for your talk that was just perfect ;) Though I
think your last paragraph addition on the rmap thing is fair enough.
I only abused your very nice and detailed list of features, to comment
on some that IMHO had some drawback (and for some [not rmap] I don't
recall any discussion about their drawbacks on l-k ever, that's why I
answered).
thanks,
Andrea
