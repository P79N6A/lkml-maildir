If you've replaced the drive, the decss keys might have changed for inserted 
media (this is especially true if your old drive had a different region 
setting).
First set the DVD region on the drive to where you are (probably 2), 
using "regionset". Then rm -rf ~/.dvdcss and restart your video playing 
application. It should rescan the dvd, figure out the keys, no error 
messages.

Yeah, like Alan says it's just the DRM nonsense built into your drive trying 
to "protect" the media. You can find firmware modifications which remove this 
logic from the drive, but I'm not sure of their legality.
