Given how much time it will take to compare the file's timestamp to
current before choosing 999999999 or now for the tv_nsec field, is
it a reasonable shortcut to just always use now's nsec value?
Obviously it is not *that* many cycles to do the compare, but we are
talking about a nanoseconds field, and the current tv_sec could
increment during the compare....
