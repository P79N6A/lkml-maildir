The rôle of 'embedded maintainer' is a little different to other
maintainers -- it's not about owning a certain part of the code. We need
to keep an eye on changes throughout the kernel, for how they affect
embedded systems. That's not just 'bloatwatch', but other things too --
making sure that people don't keep assuming that "all the world's a PC",
for sure, but also feature requests -- talking to those working on XIP
for S390 block devices, and trying to ensure that the infrastructure
work they do is useful for XIP from flash in embedded systems, to pick
an example from the not-so-distant past.
So I can't really give you a simple answer to the question. It's
"anything which could have implications for embedded systems which
normal people might not have thought of". But I'll continue to trawl
linux-kernel with that mindset anyway, so I wouldn't worry _too_ much.
I see the linux-embedded list being mostly useful in bringing developers
"into the fold" from companies who have largely been resistant to being
part of the community. Asking them to join linux-kernel is probably not
a good idea; I see it as a kind of targeted kernelnewbies, in one sense.
