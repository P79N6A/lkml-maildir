Unfortunately, this came back after using 2.6.19-rc1 for a couple of days
without reboot. And I just re-tested and was able to re-produce the problem on
2.6.19-rc2, as well. So the problem is still there, with the same symptoms:
after usig machine for a while, or under stress (e.g. if I do a full kernel
compile), I stop getting any ACPI events.
tail -f /var/log/acpid
does not show anything, even on Fn/F4 which is supposed ot be always enabled.
Restarting the acpid doesn't do anything either - ACPI starts working
again, for a while, only after reboot.
Worked fine under 2.6.18 (I was running vanilla + this patch
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/20/56
 which made it into upstream since then).
Any ideas? How to debug this?
