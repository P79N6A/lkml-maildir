Did that USB controller use to work in older kernels?

That does seem to be seriously broken.
The old code wouldn't do that IRQ fixup for IO-APIC users, and I think 
that's correct.
The commit (93cffffa19960464a52f9c78d9a6150270d23785) says:
    [PATCH] PCI: do VIA IRQ fixup always, not just in PIC mode
    At least some VIA chipsets require the fixup even in IO-APIC mode.
    This was found and debugged with the patient assistance of Stian
    Jordet <liste@jordet.nu> on an Asus CUV266-DLS motherboard.
and I've cc'd the guilty parties. 
Bjorn: there's no way that "& 15" can be correct. There is no reason to
believe that the APIC interrupt number bears any relation to the legacy 
number or the low four bits.
Others (Mathieu Berard) have reported problems with that patch too, I
think we should revert it.
What are the numbers for Stian Jordet? It might make more sense to instead 
of comparing for ACPI/IO-APIC, just compare the irq against 16. Ie just do
	if (dev->irq > 15)
		return;
in quirk_via_irq(), since if it's not a legacy mode interrupt, we simply
don't know what to do. That "&15" is just a total guess, and makes little 
or no sense at all.
