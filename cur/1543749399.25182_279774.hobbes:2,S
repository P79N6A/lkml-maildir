Looking at the comments and some old posts on the topic, are you sure 
this is the right fix? It is uncalled, and has been since 2.6.0 (oldest 
thing I have handy), but I think the actual bug may be that someone 
forget to call it, possibly from bttv_init_card2?
It would appear to not be needed because a reset clears it, but in the 
event that resume starts working, it might be useful.
