Subject: Bugs sitting in the RESOLVED state for more than 28 days
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These bugs have been sitting in RESOLVED state for more than 28 days,
ie, they have fixes, but aren't back in the mainline tree (when they
should move to CLOSED state). If the fixes are back in mainline
already, could the owner close them out? Otherwise, perhaps we
can get those fixes back in?  If the patch has not fixed the problem
then the bug needs to be moved back into the NEW or ASSIGNED state.
