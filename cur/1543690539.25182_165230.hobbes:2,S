If the program is doing lots of page faults to SEGV signals 
intentionally, each of those transitions (exception to-> kernel ->
process -> signal-back to user) is already pretty expensive.
I would think that the slight overhead that is_prefetch() 
adds in this case is pretty low in comparision because 
the transitions themselves are very expensive in cycles. 
Most of the time, is_prefetch should be able to tell if 
it is a prefetch from just reading the first byte 
(one memory access).
We can measure this for such programs if need be, but, I would bet
we won't see any difference.
Having said that, I'm agnostic to whether is_prefetch() 
gets compiled out for non-AMD processors. I defer to 
all the kernel experts here if that is feasible or not.
