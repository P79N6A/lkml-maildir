The above numbers really do not tell you much, I have some better ones. 
Here is the histogram for a 5,000,000 sample run with M5:

So if you discard the highest ~10 of 5,000,000, it's the same as L2.  Maybe a 
corner case, or a new race condition?  I will run the above test with L2.
I wonder if the multiple spikes represent different code paths, or the same 
but with a hot/warm/cold cache?
