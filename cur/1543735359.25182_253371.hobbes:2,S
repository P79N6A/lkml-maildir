I very much doubt, I'd expect this to work, but it really should be a
config option if you don't open 2.7. This is the kind of thing that
cannot happen in a 2.6.* release without a config option to leave off in
production IMHO since it can have implications well outside the mainline
kernel (every driver outside the kernel would be affected too).
