Subject: SMP Panic caused by [PATCH] sched: consolidate sched domains
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch causes an immediate panic when the secondary processors come
on-line because sd->next is NULL.
The fix is to use cpu_possible_map instead of nodemask (which expands,
probably erroneously, to cpu_online_map in the non-numa case).
Any use of cpu_online_map in initialisation code is almost invariably
wrong, so please don't do it in future.
I know I'm sounding like a broken record, but it would be a lot easier
to spot mistakes like this immediately if every arch used the hotplug
paths to bring SMP up.
Anyway, the attached fixes our panic.
James
