Isn't that a thinko in there?  The build using the edited file would
happen in the same layer as that file or in another one on top.  If it's
the same, the build would be deleted with the change.
If it's in another one on top you'd be removing a layer in the middle.
I don't know if that should be possible without user intervention
(unmount build and change layers, delete change layer, mount build layer
over source).  There is something said about Unix and ropes, I remember.
Then again I don't know the unionfs idea in these details, so I may be
wrong.
Unionfs as I understand it would be great for editing/patching and
building.  Build a kernel in the pristine sources, mount a COW layer
over it where you patch/edit, build there.  In the ideal case the COW
layer would only build the changed file(s) and link vmlinux with all the
other objects from the pristine build.  This wouldn't affect the
pristine build itself at all, no make problems there when you remove the
COW build&change layer.
