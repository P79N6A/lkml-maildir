A system I was using a few minutes ago dumped this to the syslog:
Jul  9 17:50:38 daydream kernel: [76022.613000] BUG: unable to handle
kernel NUL
L pointer dereference at virtual address 00000010
Jul  9 17:50:38 daydream kernel: [76022.613000]  printing eip:
Jul  9 17:50:38 daydream kernel: [76022.613000] c01ace66
Jul  9 17:50:38 daydream kernel: [76022.613000] *pde = 00000000
Jul  9 17:50:38 daydream kernel: [76022.613000] Oops: 0000 [#1]
There was no other information either before or after.
What I saw was my KDE desktop stopped responding to events.
Machine didn't respond to power switch.
Unfortunately, that's all I know.
In the past when I had bugs like this, I got a fairly extensive kernel
error message, but this time the above is the only thing I saw.
I have not had kernel bugs like this until I started running 2.6.20 on a
new Kubuntu install.
Same hardware, but Slackware and my own custom 2.6.19 kernel never
crashed.
Is there anything I can do, in case this happens again, to try and
capture more information?
