Actually that's more likely a driver-specific characteristic than
something related to board wiring/configuration ... a characteristic
of the particular protocol requests being made.  That's why for
example bits_per_word has a per-transfer override, and drivers are
able to call spi_setup(spi).

The initial driver set didn't need it, that's all.  ISTR someone
else pointed out this quirk, but never provided a patch to resolve
the issue.
