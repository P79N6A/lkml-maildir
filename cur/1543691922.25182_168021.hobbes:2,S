that is _the_ issue from my part, the thing that isn't remotely going to
make me think to use bitkeeper. If there wasn't that clause in the
licence I would probably find acceptable to use it in the meantime.
But I guess I'd better go away as you ask since I feel like nobody
understands why I'm not using it despite I'm trying to explain it a few
times already.

I'm not complaining about that, I was making a suggestion to Marcelo
outlighting what was possible to achieve if it was open (yeah, it's a
minor thing). Larry even said what I suggested was not an optimal fix
and I agree with that so I will try to fix it right. I think it was a
productive suggestion after all.
