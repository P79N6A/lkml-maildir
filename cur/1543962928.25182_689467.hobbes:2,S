I'm running into a VERY frustrating bug with page caching and swap.
I'm going to write a long post on this and forward it to the list.
In the mean time is it possible to disable the page cache or limit it
to say 10% of system memory?
I haven't found any way to do this yet.
You could do this with RHEL 4.x but I don't recall this ever making it
into 2.6 :-/
Feedback appreciated.
