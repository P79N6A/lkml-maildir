Perhaps this one is related?

If the corruption caused by this bug could lead to the filesystem
corruption I observed, it would match my observations quite well:
- Corruption started shortly after I upgraded to a kernel with 
  ipw2200 driver version 1.0.8
- Happens when using wireless
- File system corruption happens with laptop mode (because then the
  probability that dirty pages which will be written to disk later can
  be overwritten before the write actually happens is much higher)
- Problem is difficult to reproduce, as it's not deterministic which
  type of data structure gets overwritten, and it can happen only once
  per reboot (or driver reload)
Question is, could this bug cause filesystem corruption without any Oops
visible in the kernel log? Cc: to Zhu Yi at Intel - can you answer this
question?
