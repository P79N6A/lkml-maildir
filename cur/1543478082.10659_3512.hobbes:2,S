If you have a 10/100 card, you normally won't see a coax port since
100 Mbps ethernet doesnae work over coax. However, 10 Mbps only cards
can usually be found with both coax and RJ45 connectors...

Note that combo cards are normally (but not always) 10 Mbps only...

I see it as much more than that...
I spent Summer 1998 installing a network in one of the Secondary
Schools in Lincolnshire, England. They had asked various "Consultants"
to recommend how to do so, and the best "Value for Money" was one
offering to get FIVE computers set up to access the Internet for
£17,500, well above the school's budget.
By the time I'd finished, they had FORTY computers online, all
connected to the Internet, with an ISDN-2 link that included
channel-bunching to give them 128 Kbps when needed, a caching web
proxy used by all of the systems, and a firewall to keep undesirables
out, and they still had change out of £5,000 (the budget I was given).
That was ONLY possible because of the availability of low-cost 10 Mbps
ethercards with BNC coax connectors to go round the various rooms,
with the CAT-5 reserved for the bridging network that connected the
various rooms together (one run of which is nearly 750 metres in
length)...
Basic summary:
			ISDN-2 line
			     |
			     |
			+----------+		+--------+
			| Internet |		|  File  |
			| Gateway  |		| Server |
			+----------+		+--------+
			     |			     |
       +---------------------+-----------------------+
       |		     |			     |
  +---------+		+---------+		+---------+
  | Room C6 |		| Library |		| Room F9 |
  | Gateway |		| Gateway |		| Gateway |
  +---------+		+---------+		+---------+
       |		     |			     |
       |		     |			     |
    Room C6		  Library		  Room F9
    Segment		  Segment		  Segment
The segments are mapped as follows:
	Inter-Gateway segment (CAT-5)	192.168.254.*
	Room C6 (Coax)			192.168.6.*
	Room F9 (Coax)			192.168.9.*
	Library (Coax)			192.168.71.*
Since then, the system has crashed precicely TWICE - once because of a
power failure that took the whole school down, together with most of
the neighbouring houses, the second time because a cleaner unplugged
the file server from the mains...
Best wishes from Riley.
