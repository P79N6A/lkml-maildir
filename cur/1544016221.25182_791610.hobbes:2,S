Volker, your splice() is a blocking one, from tcp socket to a pipe ?
If no other thread is reading the pipe, then you might block forever
in splice_to_pipe() as soon pipe is full (16 pages).
As pages are not necessarly full (each skb will use at least one page, even if 
its length is small), it is not really possible to use splice() like this.
In your case, only safe way with current kernel would be to call splice()
asking for no more than 16 bytes, that would be really insane for your needs.
You may prefer a non blocking mode, at least when calling splice_to_pipe()
Maybe SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK splice() flag should only apply on pipe side.
tcp_splice_read() should not use this flag to select a blocking/nonbloking
mode on the source socket, but underlying file flag.
This way, your program could let socket in blocking mode, yet call splice()
with SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK flag to not block on pipe.
