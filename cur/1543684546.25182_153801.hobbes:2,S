Since it is small, and was the first, it has been a template
for many other filesystems. On the other hand, today it is a fossil,
not used very much, and its code is no longer exemplary.
You ask about minix_find_first_zero_bit and whether there aren't generic fns.
There are, but the details differ a bit. The original version was
little-endian. On other architectures one must choose between
little-endian and native endian. The choice can be read off in asm*/bitops.h.

You ask about the dereference bh->b_data and the test !bh.
The intention is that sbi->s_imap_blocks gives the number of
entries in sbi->s_imap that are nonzero. So, the bh in the
inner loop should be non-NULL. But after the loop bh can be NULL,
namely when sbi->s_imap_blocks == 0.
