System freezes on loading/uloading hisax module. (during booting up and 
down)
I have PIV 2.4 with HT and Intel board GBF, 512 MB RAM, 40 GB ExcelStor.
System is default SuSe 9 Pro installation.
When I turn acpi off on boot up system is getting up, but when I 
shutdown it freezes on unloading hisax module.
No messages by kernel and nothing works (keyboard, mouse) except reset 
and power buttons.
