I made a mental note to test that code.
How's this look?

We could, but there are the dreaded "future plans".  In several places
we're syncing the whole file unnecessarily.  Most notably, O_SYNC writes. 
I'd like to get us to the stage where an O_SYNC write writes and waits upon
just the pages which are within the range of the caller's write(), without
holding i_sem.
