Well its as mature as the can be as this point. The
patch has followed along with David's cachefs patches since
2.6.10 (I believe) and I've take a number of percussions
and did quite bit of testing to ensure there are not any
regressions when the -o fsc mount is not used.

Not really... or at least I haven't... maybe David has some...
We've be mostly working on stability and data integrity, in our
copious spare time of course ;-) . And to be quite honest
there are still some stability issue to iron out... But we both felt,
at this point, the best thing to do is get more eyeballs on the
code so we can ensure it moves in the right direction....
