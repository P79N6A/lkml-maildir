Thought the original was clear, b=BLOCK to block the use of the feature. I
have no strong feelings on this, although forceno isn't intuitive, people
will forget if it mean force on or off.

I would say so, but better yet would be to grey out anything requiring the
option. The whole idea of forcing options on behind the scenes is a
problem in human interface.
New thought: how about prompting the user with something like
  CONFIG_DANCING_PENGUINS requires CONFIG_VESAFB, enable or skip (e/s)?
or something of that flavor.
