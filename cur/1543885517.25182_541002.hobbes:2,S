No.
- qmgr is a versatile hardware fifo stack, that is currently
  used to exchange data with the NPE.
- the NPE can also be used as DMA engine and for crypto operations.
  Both are not network related.
  Additionally, the NPE is not only ixp4xx related, but is
  also used in IXP23xx CPUs, so it could be placed in
  arch/arm/common or arch/arm/xscale ?
- The MAC is used on IXP23xx, too. So the drivers for
  both CPU familys only differ in the way they exchange
  network packets between the NPE and the kernel.

If Queue Manager & NPE move to arch/.... , it can be a single file.
