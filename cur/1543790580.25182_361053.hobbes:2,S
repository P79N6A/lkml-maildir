Hi Stephane,
I have been looking at what changes are required to get oprofile to be 
able to use the custom sampling format in perfmon2. It looks like there 
have been some changes between the perfmon and perfmon2. The ia64 
oprofile support uses the older interface. I don't have easy access to 
an ia64 machine, so I have been making similar support available on the 
x86 version.
I noticed that the older interface passed in "struct pt_regs *regs", but 
the newer interface does not. The oprofile code extracted the program 
counter and whether the interrupted process was in kernel or user mode 
from regs. The newer perfmon interface passes in the instruction 
pointer, but the information about user/kernel mode is lacking.
Reading through the perform2 documentation the last argument passed into 
fmt_handler is a void pointer. The Perfmon2 specification 
(HPL-2004-200R1.pdf) says:
data : a pointer to an implementation-specific data structure which may 
be needed by a handler. For instance, this could point to the 
interrupted machine state and/or the thread to which the overflow is 
attributed.
However, the actual call in linux/perfmon/perfmon.c just passes NULL for 
it. Would it be possible to pass the regs instead? Why not pass regs to 
the handler? Was there some thought to allow other data to be passed?
