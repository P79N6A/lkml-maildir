Correct.  But when people try to use power management they will see
the bug.  SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN (a request for the driver to remove power
from the device) is a very different state from SUSPEND_DETACH (a
request to disassociate the driver from the device).  I am not fully
convinced the two cases should be merged.
SUSPEND_POWER_DOWN as defined should actually cause the behavior Adam
was seeing.  Which made it doubly interesting.
Will you submit a patch detangling this mess?  I believe Adams
only problem was that it did not obviously fix his problem.
