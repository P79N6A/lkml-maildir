Subject: [patch] i386: require ACPI for NUMA with generic architecture
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/6/166

X86 Generic Architecture (X86_GENERICARCH) includes support for
Summit architecture.  Enabling X86_GENERICARCH, SMP and HIGHMEM64G
allows NUMA to be selected but that configuration will not build
because it requires ACPI for the Summit NUMA support.
Fix:
        require ACPI for NUMA support with X86_GENERICARCH
        update the menu comment noting this
        set default NR_CPUS to 32 for GENERICARCH (since it
                includes BIGSMP and SUMMIT which default to 32)

 		NUMA support. Note this only works on IBM x440 or IBM NUMAQ.
 		Don't try to use it anywhere else.
