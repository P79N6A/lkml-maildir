   If the HW generates DAC for addresses < 4GB whenever enabling
   support for 64-bit addresses, then that is very broken.
That is what happens.
   Please don't complain that I didn't spend hours searching
   through the archives looking for a message from months? years? ago
   that I didn't know existed.
Weeks, if not days.

   Perhaps.  But the question is whether it is simpler/better to have
   HIGHMEM x86 kernels (which by definition have memory to spare) waste
   a few bytes to provide "sane" interfaces across all platforms.  And
   whether the kernel bloat for all the additional functions compensates
   for it ;-)
The plain fact is that %95 of PCI devices do not support DAC
addressing.
