No, it is not running this code. The code that works well for me is the
external cryptoapi (as modules) with last update in Feb 2002.
Ok, now after spending some more time googling around and reading
documentation, I'm confused. It also seems I'm not the only one (see
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/archive/4/2004/01/3/136754
).
How do you get a file-backed encrypted filesystem to work under Linux
2.4.24?
From what I understand, there are three options:
  1) cryptoapi-as-modules, which is what I'm using now and what has
     worked reliably (although perhaps not too fast),
  2) in-kernel cryptoapi, which seems to be missing cryptoloop support,
     so how do you actually use it? And what about the i586-optimized
     AES patches?
  3) Jari Ruusu's loop-AES, which from what I understood won't work on
     file-backed loops because of deadlock issues.
Now, I would be all happy with option (1) which I have been using,
except I started caring about speed a little. Also, it bothers me a
little bit that the cryptoapi project seems to have died, as I wasn't
able to find any up-to-date pages or documents about it.
So, what is the preferred way?
