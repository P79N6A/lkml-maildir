Do you have the /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state output when such lowmem
shortage happens ?

This is a problem that Bharata has been investigating at the moment.
But he hasn't seen anything that can't be cured by a small memory
pressure - IOW, dentries do get freed under memory pressure. So
your case might be very useful. Bharata is maintaing an instrumentation
patch to collect more information and an alternative dentry aging patch 
(using rbtree). Perhaps you could try with those.
Thanks
