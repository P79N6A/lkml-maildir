Hi,
on read/send failure the msp3400 driver is trying three times to recover and 
is printing a message each time. On a unloaded system this happens at a rate 
of about 1/min while watching tv and is quite annoying, while non critical.
This patchs gets rid of it and instead raises the final error message to 
KERN_ERR if indeed the communication failed three times in a row.
Thanks,
Jan
