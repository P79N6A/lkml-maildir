Well, they better show me some working and simple-to-use userspace
code, because I've not seen anything like that related to mount
namespaces.
pam_namespace.so is one example of a non-working, but probably-not-too-
hard-to-fix one.
I'm just saying this is not yet something that Joe Blow would just
enable by ticking a box in their desktop setup wizard, and it would
all work flawlessly thereafter.  There's still a _long_ way towards
that, and mostly in userspace.
Thanks,
Miklos
