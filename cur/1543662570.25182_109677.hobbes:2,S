Because it costs money for bandwidth.  I agree it would be useful, so
find someone to cough up the $15K/year for the bandwidth and you can
have the diff interface you want.  The code is already written, it has
been for more than a year, it's simply a money issue.
To put this more into perspective, the real problem is that we share the
T1 line you guys use to get at bkbits.net with our voice over IP phone
system and every time one of you use the net, the phones sound like 
something from a bad B movie.  We've tried all sorts of traffic shaping
and it doesn't work, the phones suck when they can't get the wire.
It's bad enough now, it would be intolerable if we were a patch server.
