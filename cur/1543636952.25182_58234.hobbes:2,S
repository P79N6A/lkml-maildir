I did a simultaneous:
wrck /dev/hd[fh] 0 64 2
The two disks were connected to the HPT-370 controller and both were 
configured as slave (the masters are configured into an ataraid-0 and 
contain my root partition). The test disk were IBM DLTA 307030 (30GB) 
with updated firmware. These disks are locked down to ata-44 by the 
kernel and I only got a maximum I/O speed of 21.7 MB/s. During the read 
phase one of the disks always slowed down, while the other disk 
proceeded at normal speed. In the first run I got 7.2 MB/s and at the 
second run the other disk slowed down to crawling 5.3 MB/s, but the test 
was completed without any errors. *joy* However I am not that the test 
did stress the chipset enough to trigger the error because of the 
throughput is so low.
My mainboard is a abit kt7-raid (VIA KT133 chipset), BIOS version 3R. 
Memory bus was reduced to 100 MHz (SDR). Linux kernel 2.4.18 tainted by 
NVidia(TM). ;)
DivX 5.0 seems to be a good stability test for VIA chipset based 
motherboards. It finds errors that not even memtest could detect.
greetings,
Wilfried
PS: I will do another run on my raid-0 root partition. The 2 disks that 
are part of the raid run at ata-100 (Maxtor 40GB).
