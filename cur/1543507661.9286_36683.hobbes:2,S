My problems seemed to come with me switching over to RedHat 6.0.  I'm
running their 2.2.5-22 kernel.  I didn't have these problems when I
was running Slackware 3.4 with a 2.0.36 kernel.
When saturating the connection (a V.90 connection,say by downloading
a news active file), if I issue a ping, I get lots of messages about
byte 8 not being correct:
$ ping iwvisp.com

I don't believe that this is a flow control problem, since it's always
byte 8.  Also, "ifconfig ppp0" doesn't report any errors.  I don't get this
problem when the only thing going over the connection is a ping.
Secondly, if I start two simultaneous ftp downloads, the ppp
connection will appear to hang.  I can see by the TX light on my modem
that packets are being sent, and by the RX light that packets are
coming back, but "ifconfig ppp0" reports RX and frame errors on every
packet.
I can completely reproduce these problems.  How do I begin to debug
them?
