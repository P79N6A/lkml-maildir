What you need to look at the X log is this particular part (this is the
output of my card, and for the sake of brevity, I removed the
descriptive sections):
Mode: 100 (640x400)
Mode: 101 (640x480)
Mode: 102 (800x600)
Mode: 103 (800x600)
Mode: 104 (1024x768)
Mode: 105 (1024x768)
Mode: 106 (1280x1024)
Mode: 107 (1280x1024)
*Mode: 10e (320x200)
Mode: 10f (320x200)
*Mode: 111 (640x480)
Mode: 112 (640x480)
*Mode: 114 (800x600)
Mode: 115 (800x600)
*Mode: 117 (1024x768)
Mode: 118 (1024x768)
Mode: 11a (1280x1024)
Mode: 11b (1280x1024)
Mode: 130 (320x200)
Mode: 131 (320x400)
*Mode: 132 (320x400)
Mode: 133 (320x400)
Mode: 134 (320x240)
*Mode: 135 (320x240)
Mode: 136 (320x240)
*Mode: 13d (640x400)
Mode: 13e (640x400)
Mode: 145 (1600x1200)
Mode: 146 (1600x1200)
Mode: 147 (1400x1050)
Mode: 148 (1400x1050)
Mode: 152 (2048x1536)
The list of modes include standard VESA modes and custom modes such as
2048x1536.  So, if I want to use this mode for vesafb, I will add
vga=0x352 (0x152 + 0x200) to my boot line.
