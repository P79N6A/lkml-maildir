Not much help if you put the disk in another box without their
system installed (or mount in linux/BSD/MacOS) to break the
encryption/controls. Once that's done, A floppy based OS
and tool could break open the files on a disk, when their
apps aren't running.
If it can be decrypted "legally" it can
be done "illegally" too.
