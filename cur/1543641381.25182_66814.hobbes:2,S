Do these CPUs need kernel support? E.g. do udelay() calls work as
expected? If so, there's no need to make a driver aware of something
which isn't in its scope to control. CPUFreq is basically for those many
systems where frequency switches need to be called from the OS.

Well, that's probably the idea that's behind the microcode approach of
certain CPUs. However, for many voltage-scaling-able CPUs there is no such
microcode, and so the OS _needs_ to do it.

This is only true on CPUs where frequency switches can occur "on the fly"
with very low latency. Most voltage-scaling CPUs are currently found on 
mobile systems. For those notebook users it is a big step forward to have
this ability of switching between "full speed" and "low speed" depending on
the power source. And on LART systems even dynamic switching _from
userspace_ has proven to be successful (see OLS talk my Erik Mouw).
Please note that even a "kernel-based frequency selector" needs large parts
of the cpufreq core and drivers: udelay() calls need to be accurate,
external limitations (like on ARM systems) need to be integrated, and the
frequency and voltage switching mechanisms need to be implemented --
so is there any reason why this "kernel-based frequency selector" couldn't 
just use the existing interface: cpufreq_set()?

IMHO a cpufreq interface shouldn't become too bloated. If it would try to
drop the frequency quite aggressively this should be enough,
critical-temperature shutdown / throttling mechanisms will take
care of emergenices.

This is right. But a sane kernel-based frequency selector doesn't exist yet.
Even if it existed, it would need large parts of the cpufreq patches
submitted today. And these offer some support which isn't the best thing
since sliced bread but still is happily used by users.
