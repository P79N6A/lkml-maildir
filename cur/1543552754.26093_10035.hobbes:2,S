Hello,
For one of our projects here, we've crashed head first into the 2 gig file size
limitation in Linux 2.2 kernels. While I know that this has been solved in
2.3/2.4, has there been any work to backport this feature into a Linux 2.2
kernel? I'm looking for a temporary solution until we can move to Linux 2.4
directly, but obviously not until after it's been "really" released. :)
Yes, I know this is likely to be relatively unstable. (Probably almost as
unstable as running a 2.4-pre kernel in production), but at least it would give
us a start.
Thanks for your help,
Joe
