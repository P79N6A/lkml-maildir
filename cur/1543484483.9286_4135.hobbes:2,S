Sorry to add more to a non-kernel issue, but I thought I'd mention that I'm
getting the same problem, but not just with binaries. Whenever I boot up
2.2.0 with packages upgraded from rawhide.redhat.com, I get the __bzero
error every time I attempt to load a module. Consequentially, I can not
access CD-ROMs or my ISP, since my fs's and ppp are both modules by default.
Any suggestions?
