AFAICS, beancounters are associated with tasks not those "objects".
Those "objects" get their bc through some association with a task. The
same can be done in the other case also. 
If my understanding is wrong, please tell me how one can associate such
"object" to a bc.

hmm... that is what I thought I was doing when I was replying on these
threads. May be I should have waited for this "call for co-operation"
before jumping on it :)

Please consider the requirements I listed before

I agree that discussion need to happen on the core functionality and
interface.
