Well, when needs dictate, we can re-evaluate.
Until some future date arrives where it matters for all these MMIO-only 
drivers and hardware, it's just a bunch of pointless overhead for ahci 
and many other drivers.  It's also just not the Linux way to punish 
everybody for some edge case that so far only exists in email conversations.
The beauty of libata is that you don't have to enforce such a pogrom 
across all libata drivers.  The libata high level API is completely free 
from ioread/iowrite junk, leaving each driver to make its own decision.
