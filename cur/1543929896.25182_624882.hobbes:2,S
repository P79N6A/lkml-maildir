I wanted to avoid that for two reasons:
 - casts are fugly
 - it adds support code to cast & handle 64 bits to 32 bits platforms
   that wouldn't normally need it
Now, if you really think that's the way to go, I'll respin with casts
(I've used cast in subsequent patches merging bits & pieces of the
powerpc 32 and 64 bits PCI code too in fact).
I was just hoping somebody had a better idea, like a way to add a new
format specifier to printk without losing gcc type checking :-)
Cheers,
Ben.
