I keep getting the following in my syslog whenever I startx:
Jan 26 13:43:56 debian kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key released 
(translated set 2, code 0x7a on isa0060/serio0).
Jan 26 13:43:56 debian kernel: atkbd.c: This is an XFree86 bug. It 
shouldn't access hardware directly.
Jan 26 13:43:57 debian kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key released 
(translated set 2, code 0x7a on isa0060/serio0).
Jan 26 13:43:57 debian kernel: atkbd.c: This is an XFree86 bug. It 
shouldn't access hardware directly.
I don't get the error with the 2.4.24 kernel.
