Good catch! I was obviously half awake at the time :)
We could also fix it this way:
[NET_SCHED]: Fix qdisc_restart return value when dequeue is empty
My previous patch that changed the return value of qdisc_restart
incorrectly made the case where dequeue returns empty continue
processing packets.
This patch is based on diagnosis and fix by Patrick McHardy.
