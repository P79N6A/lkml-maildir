For sparc32 ioread*/iowrite* are _trivial_.  Look, the only defining
properties are
* if p is ioremap(whatever, len), then for any q from p to p + len - 1
we have ioread8(q) == readb(q), etc.
* if p is ioport_map(whatever, len), then for any q from p to p + len - 1
we have ioread8(q) == inb(whatever + q - p), etc.
ioread8		readb			inb
iowrite8	writeb			outb
ioread16	readw			inw
iowrite16	writew			outw
ioread32	readl			inl
iowrite32	writel			outl
ioread.._rep	loop of raw_read...	ins...
iowrite.._rep	loop of raw_write...	outs...
And that's it.  On sparc32 we can just have ioport_map() cast to void __iomem *
and be done with that.  And have io...() do corresponding memory access;
the only thing to keep in mind is that _rep variants do native-endian
access.
lib/iomap.c versions assume that PIO space needs different low-level
primitives for access and can be shifted outside of iomem space.
There we have ioport_map() add offset to port number and io{read,write}...
check the address and either do iomem access or subtract that offset and
do PIO one.  Nothing of that kind makes sense on sparc32 - the only
use for similar mechanism would be to try and encode AST into pointer.
But we are mapping them all into kernel context anyway, so there's no
need to bother with that...
