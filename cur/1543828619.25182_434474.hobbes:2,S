How do you expect to be able to share the pools? Or are you saying you
just one page per numa node? Having a page per thread is not noticable
and for databases, which was your primary target usergroup, I think it's
fair to see it won't even be visible as noise.

It should be pretty easy to make the allocator aware of the per thread
regions based on the address.

But if you don't migrate the pages with it, the numa aware allocation is
wasted anyway, whether you do it on a first-touch basis or using
vgetcpu.

Static configuration? I never said anything about that, I said that libc
should offer a memory pool per thread and have it created when it's
first touched by the thread. That solves exactly what you have described
so far unless is something else you also expect to benefit from
vgetcpu().
