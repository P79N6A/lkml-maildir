Clearly not, it requires another set of registers including instruction
counter.

That is not correct, it certainly can slow the machine down. Speculative
execution is used, but it's not free, since it requires fetching
instructions not used through a limited bandwidth to memory. Much on this
in comp.arch, there is a tradeoff between avoiding stalls and causing
them, separate branch target cache, etc. Details probably a lot better to
be discussed there.
