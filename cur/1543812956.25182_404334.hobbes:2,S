I thought regular stores were always ordered anyway?

By synchronous, do you mean ordered with respect to all other accesses
(regular memory, MMIO, prefetchable MMIO, PIO)?
In other words, if I store a value in regular memory, then do an
outb() to a device, and the device does a DMA read to the location I
just stored to, is the device guaranteed to see the value I just
stored (assuming no other later store to the location)?

Presumably the host bridge doesn't know what sort of PCI resource is
mapped at a given address, so that information (whether the resource
is prefetchable) must come from the CPU, which would get it from the
TLB entry or an MTRR entry - is that right?
Or is there some gentleman's agreement between the host bridge and the
BIOS that certain address ranges are only used for certain types of
PCI memory resources?

What ordering is there between stores to regular memory and stores to
non-prefetchable MMIO?
If a store to regular memory can be performed before a store to MMIO,
does a wmb() suffice to enforce an ordering, or do you have to use
mmiowb()?
Do PCs ever use write-through caching on prefetchable MMIO resources?
Thanks,
Paul.
