Although in that case since it is a single cpu there is a much
more elegant implementation.  We don't need a full cpumask_t to
describe it.

I agree, I am just arguing that adding another awkward interface to
the current situation does not really make the situation better, and
it increases our support burden.
For a bunch of this it is arguable that the way to go is simply to
parse the irq type in /proc/interrupts.  All of the really weird cases
will have a distinct type there.  This certainly captures the MSI-X
case.  There is still a question of how to handle the NUMA case but...
