I was a little surprised to see top tell me this:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND           
10642 mru       11   0 23200  81m 2740 S  0.0 37.0   0:00.07 tcvp              
It didn't make sense that RES > VIRT, so I check /proc/pid/*.  Their
contents are below.  Am I missing something?  Note that they are not
consistent with the 'top' line above, since they were copied at a
different time.  The effect is easily reproducible.  It happens every
time I run my music player with using ALSA.
The memory usage summary by top, also doesn't agree:
Mem:    224140k total,   219236k used,     4904k free,     7184k buffers
Swap:   524280k total,      224k used,   524056k free,   125976k cached
Subtracting the cached memory and some heavy processes doesn't leave
room for another 80 MB.
