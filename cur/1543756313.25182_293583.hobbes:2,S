yes, i agree with you, __libc_dlopen_mode() is an easier target (but not
_that_ easy of a target, see further down), and your code looks right -
but what this discussion was about was the _dl_make_stack_executable()
function. Similar 'protection' techniques can be used for
__libc_dlopen_mode() too, and it's being fixed.
(you'd be correct to point out that what cannot be 'fixed' even this way
are libdl.so using applications and the dlopen() symbol - for them, if
randomization is not enough, PaX or SELinux is the fix.)

such an attack needs to get 2 or 3 random values right - which,
considering 13-bits randomization per value is still 26-39 bits (minus
the constant number of bits you can get away via replication). If the
stack wasnt nonexec then the attack would need to get only 1 random
value right. In that sense it still makes quite a difference in
increasing the complexity of the attack, do you agree?
Yes, the drastic method is to disable the adding of code to a process
image altogether (PaX did this first, and does a nice job in that, and
SELinux is catching up as well), but that clearly was not a product
option when PT_GNU_STACK was written. As you can see on lkml, people are
resisting changes hard that affect 2-3 apps. What chances do changes
have that break dozens of common applications? PT_GNU_STACK is not
perfect, but it was the maximum we could get away on the non-selinux
side of the distribution, mapping many of the dependencies and
assumptions of apps.
So PT_GNU_STACK is certainly a beginning, and as the end result
(hopefully soon) we can do away with libraries having any RWE
PT_GNU_STACK markings (so that only binaries can carry RWE) and can move
make_stacks_executable() from libc.so. You seem to consider these steps
of how Fedora 'morphs' into a productized version of SELinux as 'fully
vulnerable' (and despise it), there's no way around walking that walk
and persuading users to actually follow - which is the hardest part.
