This dmesg shows that ACPI is not enabled in your kernel config - most
likely this is the problem.  Try to enable it:
 1) In the "Power management options" submenu enable the "Power
    Management support" option (CONFIG_PM) - if this option is
    disabled, you will not see the option to enable ACPI below.
 2) In the same submenu enable the "ACPI (Advanced Configuration and
    Power Interface) Support" option (CONFIG_ACPI).
Without ACPI support the kernel can use legacy interrupt routing
tables from BIOS, but on new systems these tables are often broken due
to lack of testing (because all modern operating systems use ACPI
instead of these legacy tables).
