Hi!
> The current hdaps driver queries the hardware on (almost) any sysfs read.
> Since fresh readouts are genereated by the hardware at a constant rate,
> this means apps are eating each other's events. Also, polling multiple
> attributes will genereate excessive hardware queries and excessive CPU
> load due to the duration of the hardware query transaction.

> With this patch, the driver will normally update its cached readouts
> only in its timer function (which exists anyway, for the input device).
> If that read failed, it will be retried upon the actual sysfs access.
> In all cases, query rate is bounded and apps will get reasonably
> fresh and usually cached readouts.
> 
> The polling rate is increased to 50Hz, as needed by the hdaps daemon.
> A later patch makes this configurable.

I'd insert fewer blank lines, otherwise patch looks ok to me.
