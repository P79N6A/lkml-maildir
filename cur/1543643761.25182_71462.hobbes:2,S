Am I missing something, though, or is it not the case that if it has been dropped by the parcel company or the vendor, errors are likely to show up pretty soon if they are going to show up at all.  You can't phone up 35 months in to a three year warranty, and expect them to believe, "Oh, the parcel company broke it, and it hasn't shown up because it damaged the last sector on the disk", (especially since most disks park the heads on the outside of the disk, so if that is the problem, you're going to notice it straight away).
I suppose that you could have a problem like a cracked spindle that didn't show up straight away, but realistically, if it's not your fault it got broken, then it's not likely to show up after a couple of years, is it?
John.
