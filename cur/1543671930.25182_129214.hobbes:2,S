That is what I posted in my first message in this thread... The shift 
algorithm only works fine for uniform distributed input values... But here is 
a version that behaves better for small values, too. I don't think it will 
reach the tree version but it should be much better that the old version!
int fls_shift(int x)
{
	int bit;
	if(x & 0xFFFF0000) {
		bit = 32;
 
		while(x > 0) {
			--bit;
			x <<= 1;
		}
	} else {
		bit = 0;
 
		while(x) {
			++bit;
			x >>= 1;
		}
	}
	return bit;
}
For me this version even speeds up the uniform distributed benchmark...

If this is the case the tree version will surely be the best!
But I think this topic is not worth any further work as this is not used very 
often... So this version will be my last one!
But this was a good example how suited algorithms can speed up benchmarks ;-)
