so you agree it'd better be a separate syscall, also given it seems
the current remap_file_pages api in 2.5 seems unfortunately already
frozen since I think it's wrong as it should only work on VM_NONLINEAR
vmas, it's very unclean to allow remap_file_pages to mangle whatever vma
out there despite it has to deal with truncate etc.. I think the minium
required change to the API is to add a MAP_NONLINEAR that converts in
kernel space to a VM_NONLINEAR. You allocate the mapping with
mmap(MAP_NONLINAER) and only then remap_file_pages will work. This
solves all the current brekages (and it'll be trivial to skip over
VM_NONLINEAR in the 2.4 vm too). (then there's the rmap/mlock/munlock
issue but that's an implementation issue non visible from userspace
[modulo security with the sysctl], this one instead is a API bug IMHO
and it'd better be fixed before people puts the backport in production)
Again, all in my humble opinion.
Andrea
