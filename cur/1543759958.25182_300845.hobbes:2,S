That patch is probably what's missing then. Everything works fine here 
now that I've turned of the 'Sense' channels. And there is no problem 
retaining that value each reboot. The issue was that things stopped 
working during the upgrade and the solution was far from obvious.
So I'm not having any problems with this change anymore. I was just 
thinking about the other poor sods who are upgrading to 2.6.11 =)
