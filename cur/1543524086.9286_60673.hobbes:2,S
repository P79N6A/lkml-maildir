I forgot to re-mention that I'd be doing the others (inode_operations
is next, BTW) as this patch does or doesn't get accepted.  Since the
initializers are so close together, putting out multiple versions (diff
structs) at the same time would give lots of conflicting patches (a bad
thing :) so rather than confuse the issue, I think the best chance of
acceptance is to keep it simple (Linus/Alan may even want it broken
down into small sub-patches and if so I hope they ask :).
file_operations was first mainly because I saw the Arla group thinking
about adding a couple of entries, which made me start going through
what code was based on the current ordering and realizing that the
vast majority didn't even make use of this gcc-ism. :)

Absolutely.  Any user-space-visible structs should keep ordering
anyway just to keep the ABI stable, so that we're not forcing gcc
on user-space is just a side benefit.

Yup, and since the kernel is gcc-specific anyway, we might as well
get some benefit from it :)

I'd rather keep it simple and see if we can get this accepted first.
Once the first one goes through and is accepted, the following ones should
be easy enough (I'm already done with inode_operations, for instance,
but want to create non-conflicting patches as per the above).
As it stands, even just file_operations is a very large patch, and
as the first time through only got 1.75% accepted, it's best to (imho)
work out any issues Linus/Alan/etc have with it now rather than flood
the list with patches that'll never get accepted.
Until then, I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope the savings of
~1.5k lines of code will show up on Linus' radar :)
