This never works. Be honest. Nobody takes out features, they are stuck 
once they get in. Which is exactly why my job is to say "no", and why 
there is no "accepted unless proven bad".

Talk is cheap.
I've not seen a _single_ bug-report with a fix that attributed the
existing LKCD patches. I might be more impressed if I had. 
The basic issue is that we don't put patches in in the hope that they will
prove themselves later. Your argument is fundamentally flawed.
