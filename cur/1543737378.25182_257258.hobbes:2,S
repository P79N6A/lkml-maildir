it means you are running an older distro which was built with a gcc that
doesnt generate PT_GNU_STACK signatures in binaries yet. On the biggest
distros the transition to PT_GNU_STACK binaries coincided with the
transition to a 2.6 kernel, so only people who run newer kernels on
older distros are affected, which is relatively rare since most 'older
distros' are not 2.6-ready in a number of system-support areas.
(although the kernel itself of course must be able to run old code too.)
