It has nothing to do with whether or not we want the end user to be able
to use the PSN, it's about the ability of vendors to force users thta
don't want to to use the PSN.
I suggest the default be that the PSN be simply disabled at startup.  A
kernel parameter (optionally compiled into the kernel) could change this
so that the PSN is read before it is disabled.  The PSN could then be
stored in a /proc variable (and also read through a (perhaps privileged) 
sysctl command).  This variable could be modified (ala /proc/sys/*) if the
user wishes (whether or not they actually have a PIII).  The PSN would
then become no more infringent on privacy than a variable MAC adddress. 
By marginalising the PSN, it can become a useful feature without allowing
vendors to force it upon the users.
