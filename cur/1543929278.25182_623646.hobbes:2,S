Similar with highend routing or in some latency sensitive network
applications (e.g. in HPC). Another simple noticeable case is Unix
sockets and your X server communication. 
And there are some special cases where block IO is also pretty critical.
A popular one is TPC-* benchmarking, but there are also others and it 
looks likely in the future that this will become more critical
as block devices become faster (e.g. highend SSDs)

While that's partly true -- cache misses are good for a lot of cycles --
it is not the whole truth and at some point raw code efficiency matters
too.
For example there are some CPUs who are relatively slow at indirect
function calls and there are actually cases where this can be measured.
