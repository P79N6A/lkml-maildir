hi,
i fallowed the instruction to build the GCC tool  chain 3.3.2 given in the
fallowing link.
http://blackfin.uclinux.org/docman/view.php/18/43/Build
%20instructions.doc
after building i compiled the uclinux distribution with nisa-elf gcc tool
chain it got compiled properly.
but when i am compiling the same uclinux distribution with new gcc tool
chain 3.3.2 it shows that the error header file like stddef.h are missing.
if any one could give me the details abt  what is the problem with new gcc
tool chain 3.3.2 or do i  am missing something in building the gccc tool
chin 3.3.2.  it wud be very helpful.
thanx n ragards
megharaj.
