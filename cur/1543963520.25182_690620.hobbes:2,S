It's weird.

By this do you mean that there has to be a lot of other activity on the
system to reproduce it?  Stuff which is turning over memory?
Because one possiblity is that the cached dentry got reclaimed by memory
pressure and we have some race bug which causes us to think that the file
doesn't exist.
(That still shouldn't happen because the dentry should be marked
recently-accessed, but perhaps the underlying inode gets reclaimed or
something.  Grasping at straws here)
