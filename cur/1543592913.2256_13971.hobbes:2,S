...again (I think I asked just the same last summer)
and lm_sensors is still out of the kernel (we have got 40ºC in Spain
this week, and I would like to know how my PIIs suffer...)
Anybody knows if sensors will get into kernel anytime in this century ?
Yes, it can generate patches automagically, but there is a big big lack
of sync with latest kernels. Patches generated are silly big because of
things like
#endif /* Whatever you like */
vs
#endif XXXXX
and init functions and so on...
