Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Demand faulting for hugetlb

Ok, here's the next iteration of these patches.  I think I've handled
the truncate() case by comparing the hugetlbfs inode's i_size with the
mapping offset of the requested page to make sure it hasn't been
truncated.  Can anyone confirm or deny that I have the locking correct
for this?  The other patches are still unchanged.  Andrew: Did Andi
Kleen's explanation of huge_pages_needed() satisfy?
