Yea, Andrew Morton fixed this one while merging into -mm. Cut&Paste - sorry

Well those carbon copied functions are -as Christoph pointed out- just
wrappers. In addition,
we don't have sync read/write, just aio_read/aio_write, readv/writev,
and sendfile.
We saved almost as much patches to filemap.c as we have added stuff to
filemap_xip:
cotte@cotte:~/patches$ cat v2/linux-2.6-xip-2-filemap.patch |wc -l
789
cotte@cotte:~/patches$ cat v3/linux-2.6-xip-2-filemap.patch |wc -l
868
Given that the copied wrappers add just 80 lines after all, I agree with
Christoph that this is
worth buying reduced complexity for.
cheers,
Carsten
