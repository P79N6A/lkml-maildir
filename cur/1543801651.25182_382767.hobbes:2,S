defconfig's are usually not intended for running on all supported 
machines, they are more a base for compile-tests and a starting point 
for building an own configuration.
If you intend to use the ia64 defconfig in a different way I don't 
see any strong point against it.
But if you seriously want a defconfig "that builds into a kernel that 
will boot and run on just about any box", please change your defconfig 
to ITANIUM=y,MCKINLEY=n. "People who want to get a bit of extra 
performance" can still change their configuration to omit support for 
the original Itanium.
