Ok.  So I run acpid, and I get this:
	acpid: started
	acpid: FACP @ 0x03fe0054
	acpid: DSDT @ 0x03fe00c8
	acpid: S0 SLP_TYP (0x0500)
	acpid: S1 SLP_TYP (0x0700)
	acpid: S2 not supported
	acpid: S3 SLP_TYP (0x0700)
	acpid: S4 SLP_TYP (0x0000)
	acpid: S5 SLP_TYP (0x0700)
Prior to starting acpid, when APM is disabled by ACPI, the laptop does
suspend after 5 seconds or so of beeping).  (In earlier kernels where
APM is not disabled, the laptop suspends immediately and apmd can
restore the clock).
The only visible effect is that the laptop won't suspend any more.
Something obviously got set because when acpid is killed, the laptop
still doesn't suspend.
I didn't find any acpid documentation so if it's doing anything else, I
don't know about it.

My question is: is there any advantage for me in enabling ACPI in the kernel,
and/or running acpid at the moment?  Will the laptop consume less power
than when it's using APM?
