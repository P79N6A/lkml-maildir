Hmm would there be an automatic way to check out the file of the 
kernel version and then check if the BUG_ON/WARN_ON is on that line?
Maybe it could be done using git.

I don't necessarily mean tainted, just out of tree modules in general.
There are some GPL modules who do strange things too. Not saying
that these oopses should be all ignored -- they might be legitimate
kernel bugs that they just trigger -- just it should be visible somehow
in the summary in case there is a pattern. 
Especially for c_p_a() i'm quite suspicious
because it depends a lot on what the caller did.
One way perhaps would be also to check if there is an out of tree
module inside the backtrace. I suppose you could keep a list 
of in tree modules and do this automatically. Of course there could
be false positives too with the standard inexact backtrace.
