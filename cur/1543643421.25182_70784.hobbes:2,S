I've tried to provoke this error, but been unable to; the code
works just fine even without the extra space. Can anyone
confirm if gcc-2.95.4 in Debian lacks this bug?!
Anyway, *please* can we try to avoid GCC-versioned code as much as
possible? Either we raise the required GCC-version (not possible until
the SPARC64-people become perfectly happy with gcc-3.2) or we stay at
a lower version and work around the warts.
