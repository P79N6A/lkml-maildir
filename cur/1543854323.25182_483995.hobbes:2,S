NM should be using wpa_supplicant underneath.  But depending on the NM
version, NM may be issuing any one of SIWENCODE (only to clear keys),
[S|G]IWSCAN, GIWRANGE, GIWAP, [S|G]IWMODE, [S|G]IWFREQ.  Mainly, NM
cleans up after wpa_supplicant, gets information about the current
connection, and does scans.  All other connection setup and handling is
done by wpa_supplicant.  But note that NM will do any of the above
operations at any time, no matter what wpa_supplicant is doing at that
time.  So the locking in the driver needs to be right, but it should be
right anyway regardless of whether either one or both of NM and
wpa_supplicant is in the picture...
