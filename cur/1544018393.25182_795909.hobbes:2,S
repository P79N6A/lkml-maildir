Unfortunately I have no system with an irq based hvc console - I cannot test 
this patch. Anyway, the patch looks sane:
Reviewed-by: Christian Borntraeger <borntraeger@de.ibm.com>
If this really fixes a problem, I am asking myself, if notifier_del can be 
called several times as well. If yes, it might be better to call free_irq at 
the last notifier_del - which means we need proper refcounting. Otherwise the 
console switches into polling mode....
Christian, blaming Rusty for using hvc_console in virtio_console which made me 
somehow responsible for this code...  ;-)
