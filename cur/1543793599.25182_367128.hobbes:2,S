C89 - The few left over gcc 2.95 users are blocking modern C constructs.
Even without that it would be a C99 subset, e.g. arbitary long long divisions 
or floating point are not supported.
Also the kernel is a freestanding C environment, so parts are not supported.

I'm not sure I fully agree on that. I conflicts with the "merge early, merge
often" imperative.  IMHO it's ok to submit patches that are not perfect,
but improve something or make a incremental cleanup step, as long as the
problems are not severe and the patch by itself is a clear improvement. Of course
this is handled on a case by case basis.

My request is that each patch should carry a meaningful changelog.
That should tell why and a rough (doesn't need to be detailed) overview how
the change is done.
