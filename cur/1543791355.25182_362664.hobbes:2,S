Perhaps I'd keep it simple and leave it at
* do hardcoded kernel action for this led
or
* do whatever userspace tells you.
That way you will not be able to remap charger LED onto hard disk
indicator, but we can support that on ibm-acpi too. (Where hw controls
LEDs like "sleep", but lets you control them. You can't remap,
though).
