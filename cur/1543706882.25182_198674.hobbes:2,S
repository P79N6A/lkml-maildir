yeah Dan, I thought about that, and I guess I'll
give that _another_ try soon, the reason I didn't
choose that path, simply was, that I didn't want
to compile the (g)libc, because I really do not 
need it at all (kernel does not use/require that)
and I didn't want to deal with that one too ...
btw, what archs did you verify? didn't find a 
'success' list or something like that, probably
missed it somehow, anyway, currently I managed
to compile binutils and gcc for:
 alpha, arm, cris, hppa/64, i386, ia64, m68k,
 mips/64, ppc/64, s390, sh/4, sparc/64, v850,
 x86_64 ...
TIA,
Herbert
