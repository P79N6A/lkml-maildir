O.k. I am a bit outdated by using libc5, but hey, what is this related to the
non ANSI conformance of the kernel headers???  By using glibc2 the return value
won't change!
What is needed here is an explicit conversion from (void*) to (char*) because
0, 0L and (void*) 0 are all valid definitions of the null pointer (or we use
literal 0 that is granted to be a null pointer in a pointer context) and ANSI C
won't fail and ANSI C++ will be happy.
