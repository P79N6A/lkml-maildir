Both the OASB and TPC-C workloads put pressure on the VM subsystem, but
in different ways.
The OASB environment has a small (compared to TPC-C) shared memory area,
but 1000's of Oracle user processes will be created that attach to this
shared memory area.  The goal here is to push the maximum amount of
users onto the server.
The TPC-C environment will have a very large shared memory area
(typically the maximum a machine will allow) that may generate a large
number of vmas.  However, there are very few (may be few hundred) Oracle
users processes.
Experience has been that the OASB benchmarks will tend to push VM into
system lockup conditions more than TPC-C.
