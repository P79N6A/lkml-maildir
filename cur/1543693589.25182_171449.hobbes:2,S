Hello,
I just found out that the e1000-driver included in the latest kernel
2.4.23-pre6 has a problem cooperating with keepalived. Keepalived uses netlink
to find out about interfaces being up or down. This works well with eepro100
driver from Don Becker (or tulip), but does not work at all with e1000.
Probably for the same reason mii-tool does not show anything useful either.
Is this fixable inside the e1000-driver? Should keepalived be fixed in any way?
Regards,
Stephan
