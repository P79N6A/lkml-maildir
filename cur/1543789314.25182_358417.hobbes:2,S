Is that intentional though?  With <randon .config> my mm/swapfile.i has an
unreferenced
static inline void __raw_spin_unlock(raw_spinlock_t *lock)
{
	__asm__ __volatile__(
		"movb $1,%0" :"=m" (lock->slock) : : "memory" 
	);
}
which either a) shouldn't be there or b) should be referenced.
Ingo, can you confirm that x86's spin_unlock is never inlined?  If so,
what's my __raw_spin_unlock() doing there?
