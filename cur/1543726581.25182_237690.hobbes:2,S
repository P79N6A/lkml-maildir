I discovered that a few of the XRUN traces were spurious - jackd
apparently does something while stopping and starting that produces an
XRUN trace but that jackd does not consider an error.  I will fix this
in jackd.  The msync() related XRUN triggered by apt-get is definitely
real.
Here are my results with 2.6.8-rc2-mm1-M5.
							max usecs
All IRQs threaded					349
Soundcard IRQ not threaded				227
Soundcard IRQ not threaded + max_sectors_kb -> 64	119
I will test next with 2.6.8-rc2-M5.
