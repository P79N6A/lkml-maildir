yeah, the one in -mm is the latest one. (right now it's out to isolate
early-bootup and ACPI problems, but it's very recent otherwise)
the 2.4 one i kept minimalistic, the latest one you can find in the
RHEL3 srpm. The 2.6 one also contains related cleanups to x86
infrastructure.

ok. I'm not sure it's due to gettimeofday, but vgettimeofday is nice no
matter what.

it was Apache 2.0, but without threading enabled. (the default install)

with the serialization it can get really slow. I have some copy-user
optimizations in the 2.4 patch. All it needs is a "safe" pagetable
walking function, which doesnt get confused by things like large pages. 
If this function fails then we try user_pages() - to make sure we catch
mappings not present in the pagetables (e.g. hugepages on some
platforms). Another problem are IO vmas. It might not be legal to touch
them via the user-copy functions.
but if it's possible to walk the pagetables without having to look at
the vma tree then the copy-user functions can be done lockless. This
feature is not in the 2.6 patch yet.

the slowdown is higher: %0.2. This is the table again:
   1000Hz:               -1.08%
   1000Hz + PAE:         -1.08%
   1000Hz + 4:4:         -1.11%
   1000Hz + PAE + 4:4:   -1.39%
so we slow down from -1.08% to -1.39%, by -0.21%.

as i mentioned it before, i did generate a dTLB testcase too - see the
simple code below. (it's hardcoded to my setup, the # of TLBs is
slightly below the real # of TLBs to not trash them.) It simply loops
through 60 pages and touches them. Feel free to modify it to have more
pages to see the effect on TLB-trashing apps [that should be a smaller
effect]. Also you can try other effects: nonlinear access to the pages,
and/or a more spread out layout of the working set.
but please be extremely careful with this testcase. It needs static
linking & init= booting to produce stable, comparable numbers. I did
this for a couple of key kernels and made sure the effect is the same as
in the simple loop_print.c case, but it's a real PITA to ensure stable
numbers.
