yes. But the only single reason for me to even consider using the rbtree
was to avoid having to introduce another data structure and to feel very
safe in terms of risks of memory corruption in the short term ;). The
rbtree is extremely well exercised, that's the only reason I suggested
it. Rajesh is currently working on another data strucure that is
efficient at finding a "range" (not sure if it is what you're
suggesting, he called it a prio_tree, mix between hashes and raidx
trees), that's optimal, though in practice the rbtree would work too
(peraphs one could still work an exploit ;) but the the real life apps
would be definitely covered by the rbtree too (since all vma are of the
same size and they're all naturally aligned).
