Well, that change was useful for my argument: the change appears 
to have affected no-one, and so why not make it also for futex(), 
sigtimedwait(), semop()/semtimedop(), inotify read(),
epoll_wait()...

Yes.

I'll try patching a kernel to s/EINTR/ERESTARTNOHAND/ in relevant
places, and see how that goes.  If it goes well, I'll submit a 
patch.
