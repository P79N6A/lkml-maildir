Nothing exciting for desktop users. High end performance is now starting
to get better.
Has an (unimportant) accounting fix that shouldn't really be here, but
doesn't look like it will get in before 2.6.0.
Average of 5 kernel compiles (make -j) on a 16-way 512KB cache NUMAQ gives
         bk14  bk14-v18
real    83.5s     81.7s
user   987.6s    992.5s
sys    158.0s    142.3s
Volanomark looks much better than mainline.
More testing welcome.
