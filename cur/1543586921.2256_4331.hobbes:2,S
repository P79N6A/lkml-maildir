Where is this patch available?  I haven't heard of an extension to the
pci id tables, so I wonder if it's really in the queue for the official
kernel.

Not so hard.
There is no need to register more than one driver per PCI device -- just
create a PCI driver whose probe routine registers serial and parallel,
and whose remove routine unregisters same.
