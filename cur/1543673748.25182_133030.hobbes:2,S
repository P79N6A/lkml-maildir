Reminds me of CONFIG_MORON back in December 2000
-dep_mbool '  NTFS write support (DANGEROUS)' CONFIG_NTFS_RW
$CONFIG_NTFS_FS $CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
+dep_mbool '  NTFS write support (DANGEROUS)' CONFIG_MORON
$CONFIG_NTFS_FS $CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
+dep_bool  '    Are you sure?  I hope you dont care about your NTFS
filesystems' CONFIG_NTFS_RW $CONFIG_MORON
