well, I saw it wrong. In fact, sometimes the system boots OK if it
is after a warm boot, and it seems that all the tests I've done with
"old" vm86 code were done from a warm boot. Now I can confirm that
from a cold boot, it also panics. And you're right about rc3-ac5,
since it also works for me.
Still searching...
