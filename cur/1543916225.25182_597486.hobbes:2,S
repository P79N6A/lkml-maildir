I'm still confused ;-)

No, I mean that both the rcu_batches_completed and
rcu_batches_completed_bh are identical. Perhaps we can just put in a
#define rcu_batches_completed_bh rcu_batches_completed
in rcupreempt.h.  In rcuclassic, they are different. But no need to have
two identical functions in the preempt version. A macro should do.

True, but the "me" confused me. Since that task struct is not me ;-)

But isn't disabling irqs slower than doing a local_bh_disable? So the
majority of times (where irqs will not happen) we have this overhead.

Hmm, that could be true. But on large SMP systems, you usually have a
large amounts of memory, so hopefully a really long synchronize_rcu
would not be a problem.
