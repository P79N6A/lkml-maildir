What workarounds, if any, are needed?
We need those in the driver not BIOS anyway, in order to fully support 
suspend/resume and host controller reset during runtime operation.

That's the situation we run into the most:  the system is in IDE mode 
not because AHCI doesn't work, but for legacy compatibility.  We even 
run into cases (MacBook, Dell servers) where the user is never offered 
the option to turn on AHCI, even though the silicon supports it.
As such, the user winds up being forced to into the inferior mode for no 
reason related to their own setup (since they are obviously running Linux).
In Linux at least, we have a bunch of open sata_nv issues, so forcing 
users' interface into AHCI mode as a default future policy seems like 
the most stable choice on NVIDIA AHCI platforms.
