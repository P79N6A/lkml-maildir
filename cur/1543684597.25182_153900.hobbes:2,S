Subject: Does Kernel 2.6 needs to call modprobe with a minor number?

In kernel 2.6 it is possible for devices to share a major number as long
as they use different minor numbers (see register_chrdev_region).
Doesn't it mean, that now a device is clearly identified by a major
_and_ a minor number?
Right?
In this case, wouldn't it be necessary to call modprobe with
major _and_ minornumber (for example in function base_probe(),
sourcefile fs/char_dev.c)?
Otherwise the modprobe program can not clearly identify, which driver to
load.
