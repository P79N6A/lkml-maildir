Hi,
This is just a little documentation update which applies to 2.6.18-rc4.
The patch was first send on 27. July 2006 to the LKML but nobody picked
it up, so here is the second chance. :-)
By the way: Does anybody know _why_ COMMAND_LINE_SIZE depends
on the architecture? Wouldn't it make sense to generalize it
for all platforms to e.g. 2048 characters?
Kind regards, Jens
