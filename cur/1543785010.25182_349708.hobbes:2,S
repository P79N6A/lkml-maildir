Sorry I am in Europe right now and do not have too much access to email.
But here a response since Andrew asked for it. There is nothing new here 
that was not discussed before.

The local_node etc counters are not process specific. The app developer 
still has to guess how much of that is used by which process. Moreover 
different memory areas of a process may have different allocation 
policies. These numbers will be conflated in the node specific statistics. 
Without the patch one is not able to see how the application 
sets up the memory policies and how pages are actually allocated.

Performance counters to display memory allocation? May be we can get rid
of the node page allocation counters etc too. Just instrument the kernel 
correctly if one needs those number. We may have the final solution 
to our problems with the RSS counters =-)
But seriously how do you propose to use the performance counters to 
get the information on which node a process has allocated memory? Note not 
"cross node traffic". We need to know where the memory for various 
sections were allocated.

Addresses are already exposed by /proc/*/maps. There is nothing 
new there.
The /proc information gives the information about where the memory was 
allocated for the various memory sections of the process. This 
information is nowhere else available.

Allowing the user to see where the application allocated memory is a 
necessary and helpful debugging tool. We are not discussing external 
mempolicy management here.

/proc/*/maps is in wide use, there are tools to parse numa_stats and the 
output of numa_stats (like /proc/*/maps) is useful without parsing. We can 
go to the smaps format if people feel that this is important. But then I 
already said all of that in an earlier email.
