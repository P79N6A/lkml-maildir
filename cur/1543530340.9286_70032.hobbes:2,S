   But 'ping -f' does not reveal any problems. I can try to recompile
   kernel without IP multicasting and filtering, if it can cause these
   troubles.
When doing such tests try specifying different packet size values to
ping, up to the MTU of the interface.  Next you can try looking for
packet drop anomalies based upon lmbench's bw_tcp run results.
