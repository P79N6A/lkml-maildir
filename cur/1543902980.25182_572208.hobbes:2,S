A patch to disable softlockup during boot already went in.
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=97842216b8400fe9d1a20468959e2989180f8f79
It uses kernel boot parameter to disable softlockup, not exactly disabling
softlockup at run time though.  Do we still need 0=off?
Thanks,
Kiran
