Why? (a) only those which will use putcs, and (b) I see no 512 chars limit
anywhere in new code. And in old code it is there only because of passed
data are only 16bit, not 32bit wide... With simple search&replace you can
extend it to any size you want, as long as you'll not use sparse font
bitmap.

I believe that I repeatedly said that I see no problem with old API which
cannot be solved by incremental updates and without removing functionality.
It is like with modules - some believe in evolution, and some in revolution...
Fortunately modules situation finally settled down and it is enough just install
new app to handle module loading/unloading. With current fbdev even trivial
console resizing does not do anything useful (thanks, Antonio).
