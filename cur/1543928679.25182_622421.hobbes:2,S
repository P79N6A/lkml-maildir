But also give less documentation. It's also not that difficult to mark
the exports once. I've forward ported such patches over a few kernels
and didn't run into significant me

I would prefer to keep that inside the source files, again for 
documentation purposes. One goal of namespace was to make something
that was previously kind of implicit explicit and the default name
spaces would work against that again I think.
