Are your out of service equipment being disposed of properly?  
Millennium Information Technologies follows EPA guidelines for recycling and disposal of all hardware.
We are interested in purchasing surplus or corporate owned technology that is no longer in service or is scheduled to be de-installed anytime in the near future. Millennium buys all types of technology including networking hardware, PC's, printers, phones, PBX's, scanners, laptops, servers, and more in large volume. 
We can help offset tech costs by giving a substantial return on your old equipment while helping you remain GREEN.
Please let us know if you have anything we can help you with.
Thank You
