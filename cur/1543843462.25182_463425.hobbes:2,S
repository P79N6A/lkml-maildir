Yes, generally we start at non 1MB addresses for kdump. But normal cases
also we should be able to boot at physical addr 16MB.
I think I know what is going on wrong here. boot_ioremap() is assuming 
that only first 8MB of physical memory is being mapped and while
calculating the index into page table (boot_pte_index) we will truncate
any higher address bits.
When we compile the kernel for address 16MB, initial boot page tables
map much more physical memory (roughly 20MB, assuming kernel size to
be 4MB). So roughly 5 page table pages are required, say pg0, pg1, pg2
pg3 and pg4. Kernel will most likely be mapped in pg4 and pg5. But
current boot_ioremap() logic will map the new physical address either
in pg0 or pg1. Hence we don't update the right address and end up 
reading wrong data.
I hope, I understand the code right. :-)
