I should probably add that it is possible to write _syscallN() macros
that handle multiregister arguments correctly; just the current ones
aren't done correctly.  The complexity gets pretty staggering for the
higher argument counts, though, as for each _syscallN() you have to
support 2^N possible cases, just to deal with 32- and 64-bit arguments
(which is all we support at this point, so it'd be okay.)
