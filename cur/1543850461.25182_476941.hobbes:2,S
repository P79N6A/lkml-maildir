Looking at all scenarios I feel the first patch is OK. Can you add the
watchdog timer fix to first initial patch and resubmit.

Simplicity is always better. However, some questions/comments:

I used 
    if ((sp->pdev->error_state != pci_channel_io_normal)
here for a reason: the pdev->error_state is set even in an interrupt
context, that is, it gets set even if interrups are disabled, and
so it represents the actual state immediately. By contrast, the
error callbacks do not get called until possibly much later, 
and so sp->card_state = CARD_DOWN might not get set for a while.
If, for any reason, e.g. some obscure corner case, the s2io 
generates zillions of interupts, this could result in a soft-lockup.
I actually saw this in the symbios device driver, which will
regenerate an interrupt until its acknowledged -- and so it 
sat there, spinning. :-(
I was returning IRQ_HANDLED instead of IRQ_NONE, so as to avoid
falling into handle_bad_irq() or report_bad_irq(). I haven't 
seen this happen on s2io, but thought it would still be wise.
If this can't happen, then there's no problem here.

At this point, the card has just experienced a hardware reset,
(the #RST wire was held low for 250 millisecs, followed by
a settle time of 2 seconds, followed by whatever BIOS thinks
it needed to do, followed by a restore of the pci config space
to what it was after a cold boot. So the card is in a "fresh"
state; in theory its identitcal to a cold boot. So ... 
are you sure you want to "down" at this point?

One problem I'm having is that the watchdog timer sometimes
pops and tries to reset the card before s2io_card_down()
has a chance to run. I fixed this ... 
======================
So -- just for grins, I thought to myself, "Maybe I can make 
s2io be the first adapter ever to fully recover without 
a hard reset of the card."
The idea is simple: 
1) enable MMIO,
2) call s2io_card_down()
3) enable DMA
4) cal s2io_card_up()
I have a patch that does this, but then hit a few more snags.
I haven't yet nailed down all the trouble spots, maybe tommorrow.
