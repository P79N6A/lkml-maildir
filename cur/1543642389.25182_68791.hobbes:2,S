Sure :). The motivation for seeing the stats though would
be to get an idea of how much retransmission/SACK etc 
activity _is_ occurring during Troy's SpecWeb runs, which
would give us an idea of how often we're actually doing
segmentation offload, and better idea of how much gain
its possible to further get from this(ahem) DMA coalescing :).
Some of Troy's early runs had a very large number of
packets dropped by the card.
thanks,
Nivedita
