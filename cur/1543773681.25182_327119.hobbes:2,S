FWIW, we conducted our tests with the I-pipe loaded as a module.
Though we didn't publish that particular result as part of our
earlier posting, we found that the price for having it loaded,
but unused, versus not having it loaded at all made virtually
no difference on overall system overhead. Such results would
seem to indicate that having it as a loadable module has no
specific advantage. Note, though, that we didn't do the test on
all configs, just the "plain" one.
Of course the issue would be much easier to decide if you
could provide a brief explanation as to what the difference is, in
terms of execution path, between having it compilled as a module
and not loaded, versus having it built-in and unused.
