Framebuffer is already generating hotplug add/remove messages.

This event can be caught in early userspace. The helper app will need
to live on initramfs/initrd and be small. Statically link it to klibc.
You can use the modular fb patch that has been recently posted (just
about to go in -mm) to make hotplug fbdev debugging much simpler.
Alternatively you might want to look at how request_firmware works.
You could easily load the picture as if it were firmware. I'm looking
at modifying request_firmware to be more general right now.
A direct call to call_usermodehelper() requires you to build a path
and app name into the driver.
