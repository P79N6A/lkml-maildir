The point being that ipsec is the technically superior solution to a slightly
different problem.
And that we are talking about kernel modifications here which just _cannot_
appear in the mainstream kernel due to ITAR. I think this is the main problem.
(PS: I have taken the freedom to shorten the subject line. It is nice that one
 can put the entire problem up there, but I would prefer to just have a summary
 and the long description in the body ;-)
Generally you are of course right: The less hassle for the user (can it be
installed with rpm?), the more likely the programmer is to use it. However,
this was not a good example.
