This is better however if I read this code correctly.  It modifies
the code so the last time user space goes trough this loop
with nr > nr_threads.  Then we will walk the entire threads
list to achieve nothing.
So we really still need the nr_threads test in there so we don't
traverse the list twice everytime through readdir.
