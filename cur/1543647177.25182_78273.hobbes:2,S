   would it be ok to move these credits to net/socket.c?  it shows false
   positives when grepping otherwise.
No, look we still get to mention "invalidate()" in mm/memory.c, we can
keep ancient "not accurate at all today" reminders of our past in the
networking too.
It's just too rude to move the credits after they've been there all
this time.
If at some point we move all of the credits to some master log
somewhere, that might be something we could do, but that's
like 2.7.x I guess :-)
