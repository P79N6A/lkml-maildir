The kernel from Fedora testing (kernel-2.6.5-1.358.i686) indeed passed the
PCI probe on the cold booted machine with the TI PCI1410 bridge inserted
(it would have booted if not missing reiserfs support).  However, I was
unable to reproduce the cold boot problems I described with any kernel
since then.  Everything is working properly today.
I just didn't want to miss a chance to fix support for this motherboard.
But from my today's experience, from the replies I got and from further
search on the web, it appears unlikely that there is anything we can do in
the kernel to work around the cold boot problems with Abit KT7.
Thanks to everybody who replied!
