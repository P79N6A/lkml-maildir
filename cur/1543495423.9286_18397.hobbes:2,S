The same thing happens with MVS, ICL 1900, ICL 2900 and any other
operating system on decent hardware.

The tough bit is doing it on hardware which is so badly designed that
the O/S has to do everything, ix86 falls into that category.  We either
write a completely separate I/O subsystem for dumps or we drop down to
the BIOS.  Using BIOS means all addresses < 1M and single threaded
mode, followed by a reboot.
