This seems way overkill.  How about you move the search_extable()
prototype out of linux/module.h and into each asm/uaccess.h, then:
include/asm-m68knommu/uaccess.h:
	/* We don't use such things. */
	struct exception_table_entry
	{
		int unused;
	};
	#define search_extable(first, last, value) ({ BUG(); NULL; })
Thoughts?
Rusty.
