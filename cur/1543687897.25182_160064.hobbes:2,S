That was a good one.
BIOS are _always_ buggy.
Especially on production boards, when someone far away butchered a BIOS
until it booted XP instead of knowing what he was doing.

I don't see the problem, as long as the debugging code is a bit cleaned
up (no ifdefs in the functions itself). Also we have precendence
in some other subsystem that come with extensive debugging code.
Code ugliness comes from other things, not debugging code.
I think Paul's point - anything dependent on the BIOS should have a
a lot of self diagnosis support because BIOS are usually buggy - makes
a lot of sense. Otherwise one will have to add printks again 
as needed, and that would be a waste of time.
