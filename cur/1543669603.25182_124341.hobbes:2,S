A lot of developers have multiple physical machines, which makes
testing various different kernels a lot easier.

If you are testing kernels on a separate machine to the one you are
compiling on, and therefore not rebooting, it's not much of a problem
- with enough RAM, most or all of the kernel source will be cached,
and you can compile a kernel in three to five minutes on a fast
machine.
