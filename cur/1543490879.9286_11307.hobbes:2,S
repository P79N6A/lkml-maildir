Hi All,
In compiling 2.2.4 I have found that if the BSD_Process_Accounting
option is selected then you get the following fatal errors.
acct.c: In function `sys_acct':
acct.c:197: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
acct.c:203: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
Of course the build stops, and doesn't build the usual bzImage etc.
Otherwise, not selecting this the kernel builds and looks good.
Cheers, Grahame
