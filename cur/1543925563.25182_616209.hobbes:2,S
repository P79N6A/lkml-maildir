So far yes. I am now on 2.6.24rc2 and although the input device numbers
steadily increase s2ram does reliably work even when done >10 times in a
row and no problems with evdev devices not being available.
However resume is slower as some ata device (I think my cdrom) is timing
out. So it could be related to a too fast resume from suspend.
So the problem may re-appear if matthew garrets fix for
[PATCH] Don't fail ata device revalidation for bad _GTF methods
will be committed.
Is there still a need to do tests with the printk's in 2.6.23?
