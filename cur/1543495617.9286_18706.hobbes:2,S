     I've got 209 zmagic binaries[1] on my main machine, which I am
     planning on rolling up to 2.2.x sooner or later.  Having things
     like yellow pages, telnet, ftp, and trn go south would be a
     moderately unpleasant experience, though the machine probably
     wouldn't get the the point where I'd notice, since libc 4.8.0
     on pell is a ZMAGIC shared library.
