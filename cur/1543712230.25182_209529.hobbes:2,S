This is just as much hand waving as, 'All that just screams "do it in
userland".' <sigh>
I posted a rather detailed, technical, analysis of what I believe would
be required to make this work correctly using a userland approach.  The
only response I've received is from Neil Brown.  Please, point out, in
a technical fashion, how you would address the feature set being proposed:
 o Rebuilds
 o Auto-array enumeration
 o Meta-data updates for topology changes (failed members, spare activation)
 o Meta-data updates for "safe mode"
 o Array creation/deletion
 o "Hot member addition"
Only then can a true comparative analysis of which solution is "less
complex", "more maintainable", and "smaller" be performed.

A crash in any component of a RAID solution that prevents automatic
failover and rebuilds without customer intervention is unacceptable.
Whether it crashes your kernel or not is really not that important other
than the customer will probably notice that their data is no longer
protected *sooner* if the system crashes.  In other-words, the solution
must be *correct* regardless of where it resides.  Saying that doing
a portion of it in userland allows it to safely be buggier seems a very
strange argument.
