Sounds like the traditional BSD 4.x VM system, at least BSD 4.[23] worked
that way. I'm not sure if modern BSD 4.4 derivates (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/
NetBSD/BSDI) still have this.
IIRC the AT&T based system never had that "feature", and the book really
should mention something that fundamental.
The System V based systems I have seen all seems to allow you to use both
memory and swap, the question is mainly how much control you have
(IRIX giving most control, you can tell it how much overcommit it should
allow in MB/GB).
The same applies to the only OSF/1 based system I know of, Digital/Compaq
UNIX (you can turn it on and off in this case).

AFAICR you wouldn't be able to use more than 16MB of your memory with a
BSD 4.[23] VM with that configuration...

IIRC Solaris also pages from the binary, and uses it as backing store, so
it shouldn't work, at least not for long (first time it needs something
that isn't already loaded, or something it has swapped out, BOOOM).
It might work if the sticky bit is set on the binary, the documentation is
a bit unclear on exactly what it does (and if they have implemented it)
