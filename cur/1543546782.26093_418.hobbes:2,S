There is a better way to decode CueCat output. Colin Cross sent me this
info:
Taral (taral@taral.net) wrote the  original version in python
(
http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~taral/cat.py
), and I've  converted it to
perl (
http://www.mit.edu/~colin/cat.pl
) and C 
(
http://www.mit.edu/~colin/cat.c
).
It's a rather simple formula:  each character is a base-64 (6-bit)
number ('a' 
to 'z' is 0 to 25, 'A' to 'Z' is 26 to 51, '0' to '9' is 52 to 61, '+'
is 62, 
'-'is 63).  The 4 6-bit numbers are combined into a single 24-bit
number, 
which is split into 3 8-bit numbers.  Each 8-bit number is XOR'd with 67 
(decimal) to produce the final ASCII code.
Not quite sure how Taral figured it out, but it works well, decodes 
alphanumeric codes (such as the UPS tracking numbers), and produces
useful 
data out of the type codes (128 for a Code-128, UPA for a UPC-A, etc.)
