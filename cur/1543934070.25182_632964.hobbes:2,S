What are you trying to test. The documentation explicitly says you need
the delays and that the delays are in bus clocks not microseconds. That
means the existing code is correct and it needs a delay dependant on the
ISA bus clock frequency (somewhere between 6 and 12MHz). Note that the
delay depends on the bus clock frequency not time.
We don't do overclocking, we don't support overclocking, please do not
overclock your ethernet chip.
