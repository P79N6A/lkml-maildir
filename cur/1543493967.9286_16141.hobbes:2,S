What about embedded systems, without swap but with a PCMCIA flash file
system the system boots from, what would you think about that, is 2.2
or 2.0.36 better?
And while on the subject, do you think it would be a good idea to try
to strip out the swap code from the kernel, to reduce its memory
footprint or would that be a waste of time (I suppose it would break
demand loading of binaries/libraries, which would be a big loss).
