It hasnt gotten worse, its just its a very specific combination and its a 
well known problem (vendors dont enable auto dma for ide for this reason)
2.2.16 just covers the cases I know about (and slightly overdoes it for now)

I've got other reports too. 
The PCI ids I kill autodma on for 2.2 to cover this are:
                /*
                 *      Don't try and tune a VIA 82C586 or 586A
                 */
                if (IDE_PCI_DEVID_EQ(devid, DEVID_VP_IDE))
                {
                        autodma_default = 0;
                        break;
                }
                if (IDE_PCI_DEVID_EQ(devid, DEVID_VP_OLDIDE))
                {
                        autodma_default = 0;
                        break;
                }
PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,     PCI_DEVICE_ID_82C586_0
PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA,     PCI_DEVICE_ID_82C586_1
