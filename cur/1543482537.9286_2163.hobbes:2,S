Please try the following patch:
    <
ftp://ftp.shout.net/pub/users/mec/kbuild/patch-2.2.0-pre9-mec1
This ought to be compatible with 2.2.0 as well (I haven't actually
patched it in yet but I didn't see anything in 2.2.0 that would
conflict with it).
After you try it, please send me a test report.  I am moving slowly
because I am paranoid about paper-bag bugs.  Also, with a painfully
methodical test cycle, when I do get an inevitable paper bag, it's
bound to a big super-embarrassing one for added enlightnment.  :)
