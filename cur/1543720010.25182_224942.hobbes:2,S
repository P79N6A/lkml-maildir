Indeed; one of the times when SysRq-p is used in the field is when the
machine is completely wedged.  Sometimes it's the only way to figure
out where the machine is wedged.  It would be unfortunate if the
number of cases (when the kernel is four feet in the air and
twitching) where SysRq worked decreases as a result of the proposed
change.
