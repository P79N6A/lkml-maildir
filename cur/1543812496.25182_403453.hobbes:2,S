Simple: Fix the bug and submit a patch. If you cant find the cause post
what you are doing. 
What is the metric for going from experimental to non-experimental?
I surely hope it doesnt come to some irrational reasoning like
"Patrick found a bug"[1]. 
- It has been around since 2.6.7/8;
- I use it extensively on about 10 machines since (I am pretty sure a
lot more extensively than Patrick)
- I know people who use it extensively
- I am pretty sure there are people that i dont know who use it
extensively 
So on Adrian's patch and above reasoning:
ACKed-by: Jamal Hadi Salim <hadi@cyberus.ca>
cheers,
jamal
[1]If you used half of that logic on netfilter it would still be
experimental or rather should be demoted to experimental.
