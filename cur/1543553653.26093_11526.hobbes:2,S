Remember the /dev/mixer and /dev/dsp are separate.
* Driver initializes mixer to 100% muted
* Userspace app sets desired values to /dev/mixer
* Userspace app opens /dev/dsp to play sound
I don't see where any sound can "escape" in this scenario, and it
doesn't require any module data persistence...
