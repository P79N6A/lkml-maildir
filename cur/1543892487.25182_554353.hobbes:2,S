"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little
statesmen and philosophers and divines"
         Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
But damn it, those man pages were a mess!
Perhaps for the first time in their 14-year history, the sections in all of
the pages on man-pages are now in the same order...  The standard order
(with many sections being optional) is now:
            NAME
            SYNOPSIS
            DESCRIPTION
            RETURN VALUE
            ERRORS
            ENVIRONMENT
            FILES
            VERSIONS
            CONFORMING TO
            NOTES
            BUGS
            EXAMPLE
            SEE ALSO
So, I just released man-pages-2.52 and man-pages-2.53.  As well as that
change, there are a very large number of changes to achieve greater
consistency across man pages; full details can be found in the change logs.
In the upcoming man-pages-2.54 release, a new man-pages.7 page will
describe the conventions that should be followed when writing pages for
man-pages.
These releases are now available for download at:

    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
    or mirrors:

Cheers,
Michael
