Yes, but BUG() should not used for that, IMHO BUG() should be used only for
critical situation, in which you cannot do anything and here is danger to
lost data, I don't think this is the case here, but the BUG() will crash the
machine and so you might be loose data, which is not nice to do, for only to
request a report. Yes printk only is ignored by many people, but here are
always some, who will report it.
