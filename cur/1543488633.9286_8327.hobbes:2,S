Okay, so you folks have brought me to a conclusion that I can not
install RH5.2 on my system because the CPU gets overheated when
Linux "hits" it. Besides inventing methods of cooling off the CPU 
there is a way of trying some other distribution of Linux. Well,
is there a way where I can trick RH to belive that the CPU isn't
overheated? Some BIOS trick?
