What do you propose autoconf and makefiles get replaced by?
% wc pidgin/configure*
  34287  118303 1004074 pidgin/configure
   2499    7684   81532 pidgin/configure.ac
Which you rather code, 2.5K lines of autoconf or 35K lines of configure
script? As long as there's enough diversity to require configure scripts,
there's going to be a demand for an autoconf-ish feature to ease writing them.
