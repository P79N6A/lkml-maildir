    some other reason.  I do seem to be experiencing AGP problems in
    spades, but my disks at least are fine.
I too seem no disk problems whatsoever (nothing really interesting
there, many people do not) but am also seeing AGP problems.
In fact, I had to disable AGP to stop X locking the box hard... yet
agpgart and the video driver (NVidia[1]) both claim to support the
chipset -- does anyone actually have this working?)

    and it works _VERY_ well.
