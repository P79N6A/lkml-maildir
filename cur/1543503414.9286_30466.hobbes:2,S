This has been totaly diffrent from my expearance.  while NT dosent need
re-booted as much as Win 9x, it still needs it.  I havent used NT with
Service Pack 4 or 5 (by the time they came out, I had given up on NT) but
with both NT workstation and Server I had to re-boot about every 3-4 days
of regular use.  By this, I mean, e-mail, Quake, web browsing (I tried
both Netscape and IE both had problems), and using some accounting
software.  My only expearance with NT staying up over a month was on a
little 486-50 with 32 megs RAM.  this machine wasn't doing anything but
acting as a file server for 2 computers( it transferd about 100 Megs/day).
even with this, after a month, it just frose, no warning, nothing.  
Microsoft may have fixed a few things with SP 4 or 5, but that realy isn't
the point, if an application leaks memory (which Netscape seams to do on a
regular basis) the OS should be smart enough to clean up after it, and
with NT, it never did, I needed to re-boot to clean it up.  atleast with
Linux, the OS cleans up after bad programs (a kill -9 will do it every
time)
