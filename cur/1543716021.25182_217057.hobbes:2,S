Have you tried decreasing /proc/sys/vm/swappiness?  That's what it is for.
My point is that decreasing the tendency of the kernel to swap stuff out is
wrong.  You really don't want hundreds of megabytes of BloatyApp's
untouched memory floating about in the machine.  Get it out on the disk,
use the memory for something useful.
