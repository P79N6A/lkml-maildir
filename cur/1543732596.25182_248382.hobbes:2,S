Well, I'd call that userspace (if it has a pid and it's own addr space, like
every other proc).

Just out of curiousity, what do you think of L4? I don't remember the
numbers, but it wasn't much slower than linux (iirc), even on x86. I think
k42 has msg passing close to the speed of a syscall. (Bulk data could use
shared mem, maybe.)
Anyway, it would be neat to have a tcp/ip daemon. You could run experimental
code w/o fear of it clobbering other things. Somethings, of course, a
microkernel can't help (if the rootfs's fs daemon dies, you're screwed). A
little bit more containment from bad kernel code would be nice.
(BTW, for those who don't know, mach optimized away msg passing and used a
single addr space, once code was "trusted". You could choose speed over
protection. That wasn't a hard choice since Mach msg passing sucks. Mach
gave microkernels a bad name.)

How are they different from regular user procs, other then being trusted to
manage certain resources?

Exokernels are another topic. 8)

Yes it is, it's a user process.
