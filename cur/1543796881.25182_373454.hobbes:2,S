Frown.  Sorry, I'm not sure what "p615", "power4" and "no-hmc" is.  I
also don't know what an IBM 3153 is.
However, you seem to be suggesting that a terminal application somehow
forwards the ctrl-sysrq (and it's actually alt-sysrq).  Maybe it does,
maybe it doesn't.  Probably depends on the terminal application itself.
Eg, with minicom, you need to ask minicom to create the serial break
event itself, normally by (assuming default configuration) <ctrl-a> <f>.

At around this point, I'm starting to loose track of this email -
please can you format the message better, eg use at least one space
(preferably two) after a full stop and separate up what you want to
say into easy to read paragraphs.

I don't think you've addressed my concern... but I'm afraid I haven't
been able to properly follow what you're saying.
In any case, applying this patch means that you _permanently_ prevent
the reception of ^O on _ANY_ 8250 serial port, whether it be a serial
console or not.
With this patch, I guess it's tough luck if you have a modem connected
to your PC and you want to run ppp or x,y,z modem protocols.

I'm still highly concerned about this whole idea.  Applying this patch
_will_ without doubt inconvenience a lot of people who expect ^O to be
received as normal.
