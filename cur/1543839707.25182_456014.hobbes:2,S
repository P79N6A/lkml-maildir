Enums when OR'ed and ANDed in theory can produce value out of the enum
set.
And what is the difference between
#define A 1
#define B 2
#define C 4
and
enum {
 A = 1,
 B = 2,
 C = 4,
}
?

I added as less as possible syscalls - control one read ones.
The former can initialize/add/remove/modify kevents, the latter reads
ready events.

enum vs. defines were changed after David Miller's suggestion, since the
whole network stack and epoll use defines extensively, and kevent was
built for them in a first time.
I do not remember who suggested not to use char device, but I saw that
inotify specially mention about ioct/syscall issues, old discussion
about event handling mechanism somewhere in this thread:
http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0010.3/0002.html
It looks a bit illogical to have epoll/poll syscalls and read data from
char device and it's ioctls for network sockets completeness or timer
notifications.
