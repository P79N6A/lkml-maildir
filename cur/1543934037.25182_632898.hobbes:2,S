Hmm... Why?
a) this could be disabled during development if you want this
b) this would even only affect development if you add new code that
now needs a EXPORT_SYMBOL that was removed on an earlier build. And
right now this would also need to trigger a rerun of depmod. And the
same trigger could redo this garbage collect.
Or am I missing something obvious?
