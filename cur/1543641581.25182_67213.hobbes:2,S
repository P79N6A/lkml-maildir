MR> I have an old computer (from 1997), K6/200 with 430TX chipset. It has 
MR> served me well so far. It ran 2.4.18 OK since February. But 2.4.19 and 
MR> 2.4.20-pre5 both hang frequently. 2.2.15 works well but it looks to be 
MR> running in PIO mode. 2.4.18 ran in udma33 mode but maybe the computer is 
MR> broken now.
Additional information: 2.4.18 works well, 2.5.32 hangs too.
So the hardware is probably OK and 2.4.19/20pre are broken :(
