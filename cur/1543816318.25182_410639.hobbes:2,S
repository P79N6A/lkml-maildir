Where all of the values vary per process possibly, that
is they way /proc is supposed to be.
/proc/sys is the only case that I think really gets extreme.
For things like /proc/sysvipc and /proc/net it really is a natural
break, and /proc/mounts already shows that the technique works fine.
So I am trying to turn an ugly design choice into feature :)

Under the covers the implementation is per namespace, but
it isn't easy to export it that way from procfs.
In any event this appears to be a way to implement these things
while retaining backwards compatibility, with the current implementation,
and it looks like it can be implemented fairly cleanly.
