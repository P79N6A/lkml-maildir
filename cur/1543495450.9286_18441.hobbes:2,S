    And not only that I get the wonderful
    hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
    hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
    In my dmesg.
    What about the very scary 'ORPHANED SECTORS' message? Hmm. B)
Well, if that was printed by hdparm it means that you use a
buggy hdparm. Clearly 33750864-16514064=17236800, and the
author of that message didnt understand the geometry details.
I have hdparm-3.3 here and it does not contain this string.
