I wasn't thinking in terms of long run queues, actually. Well, not
hugely long like dozens of tasks. Even a with a few tasks, thread
switching is measurably worse due to aliasing. This is of course a
side effect of having such incredibly fast thread switching times, so
you start to notice a few cache misses here and there :-)
I don't see your point about penalising the "common, few threads"
case, though. To me it looks like it improves performance
*always*. Where is the performance hit?
