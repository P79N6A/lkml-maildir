If you think using subjects like "Thinking out of the box" (implicitely 
calling everybody else narrow-minded) and "vi causes brain damage" is 
starting out nice, you also got a serious communication problem.

Funny, even Microsoft acknoledges that Linux can very well compete, as 
does your beloved Novell that just recently bought Suse. Maybe you 
haven't noticed yet that you're the only one left that thinks Linux 
can't compete.

Well, it's not a stupid error, this is called a limit. Other people have 
already explained to you how the UNIX shell works, so I'm not going to 
repeat it again.
That said, I even would admit that I have been bitten by this limit 
before (deleting a few thousand bounced mail in a spool directory),

I use Linux since the mid 90's and remember thousands and thousands of 
bugs fixed and limits removed. But you must be here longer and have the 
better view of how "the Linux culture" really works.

Nobody denied the limit, you were just pointed out that you don't have a 
fucking clue what the behavior actually means and where the limit lies.
And calling other people brain-damaged at the same time...

Well, it tells _me_:
- It is a limit and not a bug
- The limit is not severe, not many people constantly have to delete 
millions of files in the directory without deleting the directory itself
- the limit can be worked around by "find . |xargs \rm"
But, as you proved again and again, you're the expert.

You might have wanted to make this point. But all you really showed is 
that you're an arrogant, ignorant loudmouth, takling about things you 
have no clue about. I bet you haven't written a single line of decent 
code in your life.
Kind regards
