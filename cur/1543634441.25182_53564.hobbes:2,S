Exactly. It also becomes a little easier to slot in support
for new vendors, than navigating a 120kb .c file.

Thanks for doing this..  I goofed the Makefile, and it doesn't build
correctly as modules under 2.5. Fixed one is at 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/Makefile
Just drop it into drivers/char/agp/ after applying my patch.
Due to build system differences, I'm not sure if your 2.4 patch also
suffers the same problem..
Oh, and agp.h has the definition of PFX below code which uses it,
and should be moved around..
