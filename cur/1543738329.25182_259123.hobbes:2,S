Hi Matt,
I reply to this post because it has more examples ;-)

This is not nice. Especially because changes cannot be made
gradually. You need to put in the whole tree each time you change
something. Concurrent processes modifying the structre need additional
mechanisms for synchronization.

Add a way to create levels. This one is hard to "parse" and again
there is no protection for the "own" domains and maybe trouble with
synchronization.

I like the hierarchical idea, too. The natural way to build it would
be by starting from the cpus and going up. This tree stands on its
leafs... and I'm not sure how to express that in a filesystem.
How about this:
If you would go from top (global) domain down the default could be to
have a directory
sched_domains/
              global/
                     cpu1
                     cpu2
                     ...
The cpuX files would always exist. All you'd need to do would be to
create subdirectories and move the cpuX files from one to the
other. You should be able to remove directories if they are empty.
  # cd sched_domains/global
  # mkdir node1 node2
  # mv cpu1 cpu2 node1
  # mv cpu3 cpu4 node2
sched_domains/
              global/
                     node1/
                           cpu1
                           cpu2
                     node2/
                           cpu3
                           cpu4
or disconnected domains:
  # cd sched_domains
  # mkdir interactive batch
  # mv global/cpu1 global/cpu2 interactive
  # mv global/cpu3 global/cpu4 batch
  # rmdir global
sched_domains/
              interactive/
                          cpu1
                          cpu2
              batch/
                    cpu3
                    cpu4
