Looking through my logs this morning I found a  lot of these:
May  3 18:08:28 finch kernel: nfs_revalidate_inode: Logs/27.log getattr failed, ino=285207, error=-116
May  3 18:08:28 finch kernel: NFS: bad fh 8e0080000200000000000a00175a04006bbbfe0e00000a0002000000a97aba19
May  3 18:08:28 finch kernel: NFS: lookup failed, error=-2
