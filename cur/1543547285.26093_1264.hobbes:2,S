Hi,
The drm code is added to 2.2.18pre, and this code uses the 2.4 __setup()
mechanism a lot. The patch at 
http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/setup.diff
 (16Kb 
so not posted here) adds this to 2.2.18pre2. The biggest part of the patch
is the change from char.a to char.o; this is needed to prevent the linker 
from being too smart.
The patch only changes the i386 linker-script, if this patch makes it into
2.2.18, I'll make sure the other archs are changed as well.
Greetings,
   Arjan van de Ven
