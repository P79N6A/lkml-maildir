Only the root should have a NULL parent, so this is just covering up some
other problem - you have a resource which somehow has illegally ended up
with a NULL parent pointer while it's been registered.
Maybe try adding:
		if (p->parent == NULL) {
			printk("resource with null parent: %lx-%lx: %s\n",
				p->start, p->end, p->name);
			break;
		}
just before the test in that loop, and then finding out why that resource
is becoming invalid.
