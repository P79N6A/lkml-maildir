Subject: drivers missing __devexit_p in 2.4.18pre3

A quick check of the source code shows that the following drivers
appear to still be lacking the devinit fixes which are needed for
the kernel to compile when using newer versions of binutils.
Each of these files probably needs the following (though I'm too
lazy to do it all myself, since my kernel doesn't use any of this
stuff):
	s/remove:\(.*\)/remove:__devexit_p(\1)/g
