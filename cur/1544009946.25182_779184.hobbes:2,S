With pci=nomsi I still get the same "irq 19: nobody cared".
The devices that normally get MSI now get assigned as follows:
- pcieport-driver: IRQ 16 and 17
- iwlagn: irq 17
- e1000e: irq 22
ohci1394 remains the only driver at irq 19.
Except for the changes due to the nomsi option I see no significant 
changes in dmesg for boot plus one suspend/resume cycle.
