Hi Ross, can you post the contents of /proc/interrupts, /proc/ide/amd74xx
and /proc/ide/ide*/config, and also the output of "hdparm -I /dev/hd*" for
each of your ATA / ATAPI devices?
If the PIO and UDMA modes are setup correctly I can't think of anything
inside the IDE driver that should be causing random lockups.  I'd be much
more suspicious of ACPI / APIC / interrupt setup.
