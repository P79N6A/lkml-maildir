Unknown currently what are the exact circumstances.
For the other cases it is ignored right now, but when we get 
more information it might be needed to clear the CLFLUSH 
feature bit on those CPUs.

x86-64 __memcpy does something different. 
It might make more sense
At some point I hope to change the i386 setup to be more like x86-64
anyways -- the x86-64 version is imho much better.

Then define a macro
#define BREAKPOINTS(x) \
	((unsigned char [x]){ [0 ... x] = BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTIONS })
and use that

All supported gccs support variable length arrays.

Sounds like a bogus idea to me.

Yes that was my point. Not a very strong one admittedly.
