If it's looking for a `problem' in fork, etc, I can't help.
If you want a simple way to have a long string in your FTPD strings, I have a
configuration (no changes to src code needed) HACK which works a treat !
Pick a random boolean flag which can be repeated, and pass that flag to the
command lots of times in its original cmmand line ...
%  grep ftp /etc/inetd.conf 
ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.ftpd -aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
% ps axw | grep ftpX*d
