fbcon_switch has to be rewritten. I'm going threw the process of cleaning
up the upper fbcon layer. Its such a mess. Yuck!!!

It worked before. Strange. Do you mean for you console panning doesn't
work on the visiable VC or a non visible VC?

Yes!!! Of course there is the issue is the framebuffer that actual one
used for vgacon or is it independent, thinking multihead here.

I have no idea why that is. You can select a differnt font.

Where are the patchs. I like to incorporate them into BK.
