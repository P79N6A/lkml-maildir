I'm a distribution vendor. If x11 really required having current kernel config 
at compile time to function properly, I'd start sending threats to its 
authors.

Yes, if an app really does require config.h (and it *shouldn't*), it ought to 
have the sanest possible default configuration (by default I mean without 
depending on any CONFIG_). And again that's something I can tell you as a 
distro vendor.

And if you have some exotic configuration or such, and your app does support 
it, then you should be using your kernel's config.h (though it would be 
preferable if you just added the appropriate CONFIG_s to otherwise empty 
config.h).
