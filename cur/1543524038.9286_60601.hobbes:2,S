Which, interestingly, suggests that -Os (or something like it) is what you
want.

Inlining can be important to allow cascading optimizations, as in:
int do_it(mode, arg1, arg2, arg3)
{
  switch(mode) {
  case 1:
     ... break;
  case 2:
     ... break;
  ...
  }
}
int 
fun(args)
{
  ...
  a = do_it(1, arg1, arg2, arg3)
  ...
}
On the other hand, inlining, as a tradeoff of size for speed, might actually
be bad (the out-of-line function can get translated once, but inline it needs
to get translated at each call-site).
