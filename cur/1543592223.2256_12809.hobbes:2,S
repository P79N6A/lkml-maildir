I guess that's much like the question 'what happens in proc?'.
Recursively entering the device directory is ok as long as everything
inside it is ok.  I tried zipping /proc/bus -r and what I got is what I'd
expect if I'd cat'ed every non-directory entry.  This is what I
expected.  Maybe it's not right - zipping /proc/kcore is kind of
interesting.  Regardless, we are no worse than proc here.  In fact,
since we don't anticipate putting an elephant like kcore in as a
device property, we're a little nicer to get along with.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but what we learn from the proc example
is that tarring your whole source tree starting at / is not something
you want to do.  Just extend that idea to /dev - however, if you do
it, it will produce pretty reasonable results.
What *won't* happen is, you won't get side effects from opening
your serial ports (you'd have to open them without O_DIRECTORY
to get that) so that seems like a little step forward.
I'm still thinking about some of your other comments.
