I'm guessing this is an exercise or something - I'm not sure exactly what
you're trying to accomplish with this - but if you created a new system
call, all you'd likely need to do is to have the caller pass in a pointer to
a buffer, as well as the buffer size, with the system call, then just copy
the data into/out of the buffer using copy_to_user and copy_from_user.
