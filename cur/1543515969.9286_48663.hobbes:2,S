Can you think of a relatively simple way to do this? I would very much like
to do it, but I think it is a little overkill for our time frame.

No. It actually isn't supposed to be great design... it doesn't have to
look pretty. It just has to produce _some_ results quickly (they don't even
need to be very accurate), so that we can present something.
Sorry if you thought this was a serious big-scale project =;)

I don't think we have time to learn RTLinux. It would probably be easier to
put a buffer IC (is there such a thing? between RS232 and A/D chip, or to
use a MAX232 (RS232 protocol) chip.
Do you have any experience in that direction? How do modems do this
(buffering or do they rely solely on RS232 communication?)
