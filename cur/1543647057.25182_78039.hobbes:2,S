That's actually something completely dumb and irritating which
Linux has done for ever ;)
What we need is to detect the situation where someone is linearly
walking through a file which is preposterously too large to cache,
and just start dropping it.
It's not hard to implement the lower machinery to do that - it would
basically be an internal call to posix_fadvise(), which we don't
have but could and perhaps should...
The tricky part is designing the algorithm which decides when to
pull the trigger.
