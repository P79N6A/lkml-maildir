The API as implemented by the driver I submitted is very minimalistic,
because it is just a starting point. There's more to be added in future,
like controlling flashes, interfacing to line-scan cameras clocked by
incremental encodes attached to some conveyor, and other stuff which
is common in industrial image processing applications. You really do
not want to clutter the v4l2 API with these things; that would hardly
be an 'improvement'.
Different interfaces, designed to serve different purposes...
