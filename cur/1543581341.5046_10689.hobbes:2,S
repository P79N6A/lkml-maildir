last time i asked why 2x74x hardware iommu wasn't supported i was told
something along the lines of cause generic kernel driver interfaces
wouldn't support it. so support for the alpha hardware would require
changing certain global interfaces (and all the drivers using them).
so for the short-term i guess you will have to implement a dri-local
hack.  However for the 2x17x boards you could make use of the IOMMU
and at least prove the usefullness of it. (and a speed benefit.)
