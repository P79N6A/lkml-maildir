Okay, thanks forthe explanation.  I don't think it matters in this
case because there's exactly one case where we pass an variable into
softirq_pending() instead of a direct, uncached smp_processor_id() -
and that is in arch/cris/ which is UP only.
I'll try to remember the hint so I know what do to this pops up
the next time, though :)
