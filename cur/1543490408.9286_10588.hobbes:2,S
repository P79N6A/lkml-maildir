Hi,
I have a nice little problem:
having a network card here, and i'd like the driver to support several
(dynamically addi- and remove-able) interfaces. so ip-aliasing would not
work, because the driver has to be aware of the different interfaces
(per interface encapsulation)
so i'd like to receive your opinions how to do this the most elegant way:
	1) an own 'ifconfig' calling an ioctl which registers a new iface
	2) some kernel modifications, so the driver is aware of the
		virtual interfaces
	3) some other solutions ...
does anyone has olso the need for stuff like this, or am i the only one
these days? ;)
	greetings & thanks in advance
		++dent
