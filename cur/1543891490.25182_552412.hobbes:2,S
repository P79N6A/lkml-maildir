Andrew, the only call that could leading to subseq. inode_lock lock
is mark_inode_dirty() I guess (and that is snown by Eric's dump)
but as I shown you in my dbg print without SMP it's OK. So
is it SMP who lead to lock? How it depends on it? (I understand
that is a stupid question for you but if you have time explain
me this please ;)
