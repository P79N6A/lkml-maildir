This is getting silly. Look:
The existing kernel uses every feature of C, with the possible
exception of trigraphs. Given a large group of people, it is
obvious that every C++ feature would be used if Linux was C++.
If you don't agree with that, you don't understand humans.
Don't use exceptions? Oh, but they are so useful!
Don't use templates? Gee, I can't resist...
Don't use overloading? But this is how C++ was meant to be!
Don't use fancy class structure? My design requires...
/* kernel.h */
#define try Try this and we break your legs!
Every time a C++ advocate corrects a misconception held by a
C++ foe, they only prove that C++ is too complex. Perhaps all
the C++ advocates hope to become the kernel high priests?
Nobody is going to "fix" all of the "bad" programmers that use C.
If forced to use a language they don't understand, they will
either quit the project or write crappy code.
BTW, I write code like this:
void foo(void){
  int old, new;  /* variable names should be meaningful yet short */
  /* ... */
}
This issue has been discussed far too much. It is dead.
C++ goes into the kernel over the dead bodies of many of
the greatest kernel hackers. The JVM is more likely.
Now, go away and leave our list at peace once again.
