Impressive.
But when it comes to file-systems like ext[23] I think an in-kernel
solution might be preferable to get the exact semantics wrt locking,
atomicity, synchronization, coherency, whatever a kernel is good at
for filesystems.

bash: cd: /dev/cdrom: Not a directory
When it doesn't match a (sub)set of known file system types I think.
Because that is the area the kernel has knowledge about. Nothing
else, no tarballs for example unless of course the kernel has "tarfs" :-)
