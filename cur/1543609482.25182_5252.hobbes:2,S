Subject: Automount FS re-exported via NFS fails

I have a situation where I have a set of file systems that are automounted by 
the automount file system in 2.4.x under /misc. I'd like to make those file 
systems available via NFS from machine.
In the ideal case, I would have something like this in /etc/exports:
/misc 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 (rw)
Thus, a client machine could mount server:/misc as /somedir, and then cause a 
filesystem to be mounted by accessing /somedir/some_auto_filesystem.
However, that doesn't work, as the NFSD seems to want to do a getfh() IOCTL on 
the auto file system, and autofs doesn't seem to support that IOCTL.
(I can work around this by explicitly exporting each possible file system under 
/misc, and allowing clients to mount them directly, but this isn't the greatest 
solution.)
First, is anybody working on this? If not, I may try my hand at it.
Second, if nobody is working on it, anybody have pointers on a good file system 
to model a getfh() for autofs on?
