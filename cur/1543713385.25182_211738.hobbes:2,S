Runs fine her with my GNOME 2.6 desktop. Fast like Speedy Gonzales.
Good work.
But now with the vanilla 2.6.5 and/or -aa1 my favourite game Enemy 
Territory quits with "signal 11". With 2.6.5-rc3 it runs stable for hours.
No change in the kernel config, all with preempt, no CONFIG_REGPARM for 
nVidia binary drivers is set, or other changes. But only when I want to 
access the net server game browser in ET to play online! Only then bumm!
With 2.6.5-rc3 all runs fine. Amusingly, hmmm?
