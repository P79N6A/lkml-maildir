I happen to think that both I and the vast majority of the people doing 
kernel work disagree with you.  Not about your policies but about your
model of sticking them in our faces.
But I can be wrong, I've been wrong before.  So you get Linus, Alan, David, 
Stephen, Mingo, and the other top 20 or so kernel hackers to agree that 
your model is superior to BK and I'll happily go away.  I started down this
path to make 'em something they would want to use, and I believe that I'm
doing an exceptionally good job.  You don't.  So get them to agree with 
you.  If you do, that's fine with me.  The point is to get the problem 
solved to their satisfaction.
So I point out the things that I see as problems in Aegis and I think
that my point of view is pretty widely shared amongst the senior people.
If I'm right, and you fix that stuff, then Aegis should be the cat's meow.
