Allow me:
{
 std::map<std::string,std::string> bar;
 bar["some key"] = "some value";
 if (bar.find("some other value") != bar.end()) ...
}
Works beautifully, all you need is to pick the existing language which
allows for the existing standard library which already provide that
functionality.
I doubt there's much need for a C+ or C 2+/3 langauage variant  ;)

Ok, I can't help you with that.
You have probably seen a Perl program before... Now imagine a two
million line Perl program... That is why the above is not a good idea ;)
It's still your right to want it of course...

Built into the language (not a library)?
<sarcasm>
Then I'd want the compiler in a kernel module  ;)

If you look at 
http://www.codesourcery.com
, you can see that there
really are some people who do GCC extentions or optimizations for money
- various institutions have funded additions to GCC this way.
It's a cool idea - I have a few things I'd like my company to fund as
well... Some time in the future...  Unless someone beats us to it.
