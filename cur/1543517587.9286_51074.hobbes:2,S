at the risk of sounding really stupid, how do I test this?  I know how 
to patch it into the kernel; but I don't know how to tell you if it
works or not.  From dmesg:
Initializing CPU#0
Detected 199838225 Hz processor.
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25
Calibrating delay loop... 79.67 BogoMIPS
Memory: 135140k/139200k available (0k kernel code, 0k reserved, 0k data, 0k init, 0k highmem)
Checking if this processor honours the WP bit even in supervisor mode... Ok.
