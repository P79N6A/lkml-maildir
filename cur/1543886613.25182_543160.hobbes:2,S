OK, finally tracked this one down - the out-of-tree iwlwifi git tree for the
Intel 3945ABG card had some disagreements with the 2.6.21-mm2 git-wireless.patch
Unfortunately, the last known-working for this was -r5-mm2, as I didn't test
-rc6-mm* or -rc7-mm* for this (I hit other issues with those so I didn't
notice this one).  I'll try to work up some of those tomorrow and see if
I can narrow it down at least a *little* bit.
