Subject: [PATCH 0/7] fuse: file locking + misc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/12/108

The following patches add POSIX file locking to the fuse interface.
Additional changes ralated to this are:
  - asynchronous interrupt of requests by SIGKILL no longer supported
  - separate control filesystem, instead of using sysfs objects
  - add support for synchronously interrupting requests
Details are documented in Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt
throughout the patches.
Note: this series depends on
  vfs-add-lock-owner-argument-to-flush-operation.patch
to compile and to some extent on
  remove-steal_locks.patch
to work correctly.
