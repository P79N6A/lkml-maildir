No. Its not me "misquoting", its just someone sound plain ?incoherrent?.
Even if I overquoted reply with whole message, its still sound ?incohherent?.

theres no "linux filesystem". there are "linux filesystems".
thanks god.
But I it would be really grate if you'll elaborate your sentence with
example of VFS functionality (lack of it) on said "other operating systems"
and if you'll define "most of work".

It would work with small tweaks, but you just can take a look at reiser4
code and you'll understand that it just could not be chopped in
"set of small patches" altough it could be documented better ofcourse,
but its really well commented already.
some times, some approaches to  some problems  just would not work.
