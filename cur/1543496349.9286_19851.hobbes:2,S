cdrecord (version 1.6.1 _AND_ 1.8a21) fails under 2.0.37 pre-patch 11
but works fine under 2.0.36
Config for both kernels was like this (as recommended by cdrecord):
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI=y
CONFIG_SCSI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR=m
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG=m
# CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS=y
# cdrecord -scanbus

In kernel 2.0.37p11 "cdrecord -scanbus" works fine and so does reading
from both CD units.
But as soon a write is attempted the program just hangs without
any error (regardless of the verbose and debug switches) and the
weird thing is that after changing the console "kill -9" has no 
effect on cdrecord! This definitely must be a kernel problem.
If someone wants to look into this I can help in testing.
Just email me at emil@spacebridge.com, 
because I'm not reading this mailing list.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Unrelated to the above problem, every time I do a mount/umount of
a CD on my NEC drive I get the following message:
	sr_photocd: ioctl error (NEC): 0x28000000
and the lines in kernel responsible for this are scsi/sr.c (line 438):
        if (rc != 0) {
            if (rc != 0x28000002) /* drop "not ready" */
                printk(KERN_WARNING"sr_photocd: ioctl error (NEC): 0x%x\n",rc);
            break;
But the unit works fine otherwise (this one I know how to correct it :-).
Details for the unit are:
	Device type    : Removable CD-ROM
	Version        : 2
	Response Format: 1
	Vendor_info    : 'NEC     '
	Identifikation : 'CD-ROM DRIVE:28B'
	Revision       : '3.05'
