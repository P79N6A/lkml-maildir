I'd say that as long as the shutdown routines are executed in reverse
order of startup, then the core driver stuff has fulfilled its
obligations.
In this case we need to understand why the lockup is happening - what
code is requiring 8259 services after the thing has been turned off?
Could be that the bug lies there.

cp .config ~/.signature)
