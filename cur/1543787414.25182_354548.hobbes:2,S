Thanks Andrew,
I'm very sorry because I have verified the code with gcc-2.95.3,
gcc-3.3.6 and gcc-3.4.4 on x86 and alpha to ensure that everything
went smooth on archs where sizeof(long) > sizeof(int). But I've
tested all the combinations in user-space for obvious ease of
validation. I believe I forgot to use -Wall. What architecture
gave you this, and with which compiler please ? I'm willing to
fix this as soon as I can understand the root of the problem.
Regards,
Willy
