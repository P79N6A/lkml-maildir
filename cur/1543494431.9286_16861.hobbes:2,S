You shouldnt call gettimeofday() from an interrupt handler. Its slow
and its not safe on machines without a hardware TSC. You can check the
flags and call the do_fast version or use 'jiffies' for slow boxes

Not really. The timer int can always become pending between your check
and the time you act on the decision - you can never completely close that
window
