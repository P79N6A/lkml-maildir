Hi,
I'm not quite sure if this is a kernel related problem or a problem with the
ping program that ships with Red Hat 6.0 (Alpha), but every time I try to
ping a host from my AlphaServer 800 5/500 I get output like the sample
below. It does not seem to disrupt anything - the server is acting like both
a HTTP and FTP server, and there is aparently no data corruption when
retrieving files from the server (but the output below is still troubling
me).
I recently upgraded to the 2.2.14 kernel instead of the stock Red Hat one to
see if that fixed things, but the result is the same. 
Could someone please tell me what's wrong and how to fix it? 
If you have patches I should try, or need more information then just let me
know (a few more details about the system is below the sample data).
BTW: I thought that this might be becourse I was at first pinging a WinNT
server (maybe it returned an invalid reply), but the result is the same if I
ping a Linux or AIX server.
Sample of output from running ping :
