The above Perl code executes /usr/bin/gunzip and sets argv[0] to "gzip", so 
this confirms that the value of argv[0] is arbitrary. Well great, we already 
knew.

Please don't mix apples and pears. Some utilities change their behavior based 
on argv[0], which indeed is not secure. It doesn't have to be for those 
utilities' needs. This is different from pathname-based access control, which 
is based on the pathname of the binary actually being executed.
AppArmor does not look at argv[0] for anything, and doing so would be insane. 
So please don't jump to the wrong conclusions.
You can have application-level argv[0] checks in the binary that is hardlinked 
to /bin/gzip, /bin/gunzip, /bin/zcat. At the same time, the kernel knows 
which of these three versions it is executing, so from that point of view, 
they could be as well be separate copies, and different policy can be defined 
for each one of them. (This is ignoring the fact that for small utilities 
like gzip, profile inheritance is usually more useful than defining separate 
profiles.)
Thanks,
Andreas
