Hi all,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, now I've finally got my ES40 booting and running
(sort of) under prior 2.3 kernels.&nbsp; There are some other hardware
issues that I'm investigating (two Gigabit cards hang the system on boot,
but not one...) but this one is definitely not hardware related.&nbsp;
Got this message when I booted the system under 2.2.33:
<p>.....

<p>Again, the system configuration is 4x667MHz EV67 cpus, 4GB phys. memory
(2GB used), 5xQLogic ISP1040B adapters ea w/ 7 disks attached, and 1 Symbios
53c895 adapter with 3 disks attached.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp;
I'd really love to get this working so I can pound out some interesting
numbers with the new per-device IO queues.&nbsp; Thanks!
