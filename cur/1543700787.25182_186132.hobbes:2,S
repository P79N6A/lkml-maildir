Hi,
I've been hit by the same problem but using 2.6.0 . As you described,
garbage in files (eg. /etc/modules.conf, ...).
2.6.0, Slackware 9.1

I don't think this is a reiserfs bug. This was my first thought and
after first hitting this bug, I've moved all my partitions from reiserfs
to jfs. But I've also had this problem with it... Now I'm back to
2.4.23, and everything works fine.
