        Well, I looked through all this standarts & did not found
    anything about REQUESTING from terminal about its codepage set or
    is terminal in UTF mode or not.
Probably you want to use the Device Status Report: ESC [ n
(or the Device Attributes request: ESC [ c).
Private extensions belong to ESC [ ? ...
You may want to look at ctlseqs.ms or so, describing the xterm setup
(which uses ESC [ ? 1000 h and similar to report mouse position, I think).
Of course, using such stuff is a bit difficult: the program outputting
stuff to a console may not have access to the input side
(as in a pipe  prog1 | prog2 | prog3  where the user types to prog1
and prog3 produces the terminal output - even if it asks a report,
for example whether UTF8 is in use, it may never see the answer).
Many programs do a `save status' at the beginning,
and `restore status' at the end, and do what they want in between.
    Imo all this standarts too old and
    does not apply to real life. For instance no one of this standarts
    does not have any smalest word about KOI-8[RU], or about UTF-8 mode.
I agree with the first sentence. But it is not the job of these standards
to talk about specific character sets. The Registry, set up in accordance
to ISO 2375, describes hundreds of character sets.
    Imo the worst thing it said "linux console broken" and do nothing.
But it is not broken [well, yes, I know about lots of bugs, but not
broken in the sense as discussed here].  It just does not follow all
ISO 2022 rules. (And even if we would fix the character set stuff,
which might be a bad idea, then there would still be other parts of
ISO 2022 that we don't follow.)
    If possibility to get console translation modes will
    not be included to 2.2 kernel we stay in situation without UTF support
    untill 2.4 will be released. Imo it the worst case.
Possibly. But I would prefer things just the other way around.
If people write interesting software, that we all want to use,
and it requires a little bit of kernel support, then that little
bit of support is easily added.
But just adding some support fragments, without having a grand design,
with no such software in existence, is just adding ugly warts to
the already not so pleasant console driver.
