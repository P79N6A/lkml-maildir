Actually, people who want to run Linux on laptops instead of MS care a 
whole bunch! And not everyone has a committment from their employer to 
provide Linux compatible hardware, or the personal funds to spend extra 
to buy their own instead of getting a bargain laptop which may not be 
fully supported. 8KSTACKS is in and working, you are proposing to break 
Linux on a number of machines just to satisfy some personal distaste for 
the code, not because there is neat new code which fails to work with 8K 
stacks.
You must have something more useful to work on, which would ADD value to 
the kernel instead of breaking existing installations. Ripping out petty 
stuff which works is a waste of your time and talent, please find 
something better to do. Perhaps devise a way for programs like 
ndiswrapper to provide their own stack, for instance.
