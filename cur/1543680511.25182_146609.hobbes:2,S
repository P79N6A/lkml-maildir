Tried to config usb serial console on 2.5.74 but it's no more configurable.
Searched the tree and these are the only references
./BitKeeper/deleted/.del-Config.help~23cda2581f02cfcb
./BitKeeper/deleted/.del-Config.in~92fe774f90db89d
./drivers/usb/serial/Makefile
./drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.h
Has this been deleted?
Regards
Michael
