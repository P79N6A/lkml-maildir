It doesn't protect against pure stores.
Even ignoring that you'll also need to disable interrupts, always,
which therefore will always perform very poorly compared to an
open-coded spinlock variant.
There are zero gains to cmpxchg(), in my opinion, you dirty and
grab exclusive access to a cacheline with cmpxchg() just the
same as a spinlock, so the real cost is the same.
There is zero justification for using this primitive in generic
code.
