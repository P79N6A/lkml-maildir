Subject: some PCMCIA SCSI drivers can be built *only* as modules

drivers/scsi/pcmcia/Kconfig:
...
config PCMCIA_AHA152X
        tristate "Adaptec AHA152X PCMCIA support"
        depends on m && !64BIT
        select SCSI_SPI_ATTRS
        help
          Say Y here if you intend to attach this type of PCMCIA SCSI host
          adapter to your computer.
          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
          module will be called aha152x_cs.
...
  it would seem to make no sense that the "depends on" clause for this
option includes "m", forcing this (and all other four entries in that
Kconfig file, by the way) to be built as modules, while the help text
for all five entries suggests you can select "y".
  as jack nicholson would say, something's gotta give.
