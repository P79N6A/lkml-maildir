In practice, it would be nice because most of X would restore while you
wait, it generally doesn't need the disk to do so unless you are heavy
on swap (or used suspend-to-disk :), that's one example among others...
At least letting other drivers restore in parallel, will improve things,
even if actual running of userland programs might still be stalled until
the disk kicks back in. But the whole experience of waking up the
machine will be improved from a black text screen waiting for the drive
to spin up ... :)
