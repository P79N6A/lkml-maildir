True. Aside, it seems I might have been mistaken in saying Christoph
is proposing to use higher order allocations to fix the SLUB regression.
Anyway, I agree let's not get sidetracked about this here.

No it's a fair point, and even the hugepage allocations alone are a fair
point. From the discussions I think it seems like quite probably the right
thing to do pragmatically, which is what Linux is about and I hope will
result in a better kernel in the end. So I don't have complaints except
from little ivory tower ;)

Heh. It's hard to say. I think fsblock could take a while to implement,
regardless of high order pages or not. I actually would like to be able
to pass down a mandate to say higher order pagecache will never
get merged, simply so that these talented people would work on
fsblock ;)
But that's not my place to say, and I'm actually not arguing that high
order pagecache does not have uses (especially as a practical,
shorter-term solution which is unintrusive to filesystems).
So no, I don't think I'm really going against the basics of what we agreed
in Cambridge. But it sounds like it's still being billed as first-order
support right off the bat here.

Sure, they would rather not to. But there are also a lot of ways you can
improve vmap more than what XFS does (or probably what darwin does)
(more persistence for cached objects, and batched invalidates for example).
There are also a lot of trivial things you can do to make a lot of those
accesses not require vmaps (and less trivial things, but even such things
as binary searches over multiple pages should be quite possible with a bit
of logic).

But even so, you can just hold an open fd in order to pin the dentry you
want. My attack would go like this: get the page size and allocation group
size for the machine, then get the number of dentries required to fill a
slab. Then read in that many dentries and pin one of them. Repeat the
process. Even if there is other activity on the system, it seems possible
that such a thing will cause some headaches after not too long a time.
Some sources of pinned memory are going to be better than others for
this of course, so yeah maybe pagetables will be a bit easier (I don't know).

Well I'm glad you agree :) I think not all do, but as you say maybe the
only thing is just to leave it up to the individual filesystems...
