Close to how memleak works.  Wrap all allocators, and maintain a 1/32
scale model of memory consisting of tags showing who allocated that
ram-clod when.  Read allocation array via proc.
For most leaks, you're right.. the tool is too much horsepower for
the problem.  Memleak has found some very non-trivial leaks though.
It found one that was irritating Ingo quite a bit, and he designed
memleak :)
