Hi VM folks,
I'd like to understand Linux VM but there's not much in
Documentation/vm/* on the subject. I understand that with current
frantic development pace it is hard to maintain such docs.
However, with only a handful of people really understading how VM
works we risk ending in a situation when nobody will know how to fix
it (does recent Andrea's VM rewrite just replaced large part of hardly
maintenable, not-quite-right VM in 2.4.10?)
When I have a stalled problem to solve, I sometimes catch
unsuspecting victim and start explainig what I am trying to do and
how I'm doing that. Often, in the middle of my explanation, I realize
myself what I did wrong. There is an old teacher's joke:
"My pupils are dumb! I explained them this theme once, then twice, I
finally myself understood it, and they still don't".
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since we reached some kind of stability with 2.4, maybe
Andrea, Rik and whoever else is considering himself VM geek
would tell us not-so-clever lkml readers how VM works and put it in
vm-2.4andrea, vm-2.4rik or whatever in Doc/vm/*,
I will be unbelievably happy. Matt Dillon's post belongs there too.
I have an example how I would describe VM if I knew anything about it.
I am putting it in the zip attachment just to reduce number of
people laughing on how stupid I am :-). Most lkml readers won't open
it, I hope :-).
If VM geeks are disagreeing with each other on some VM inner workings,
they can describe their views in those separate files, giving readers
ability to compare their VM designs. Maybe these files will evolve in
VM FAQs.

Of what use this info can be? If one page is accessed 100 times/second
and other one once in 10 seconds, they both have to stay in RAM.
VM should take 'time since last access' into account whan deciding
which page to swap out, not how often it was referenced.
