Alan has been really proactive at taking the critical bug fixes.  He has
all the tail conversion fixes and the dir fsync bug (as does linus).  So,
if you are having huge problems with reiserfs on the latest ac series,
please let us know.
The big reiserfs patch that was posted last week wasn't as clean as it
could have been, it has been broken up into smaller units, and the less
important stuff removed.  They'll probably post it again this week.
