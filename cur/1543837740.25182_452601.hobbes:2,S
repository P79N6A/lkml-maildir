For what it's worth, I'm not going to be handling these patches at all
(normally the hwmon patches go to Linus through Jean and then through
me.)
If the original developer does not want to work in the open like the
rest of us, I can respect that, but unfortunatly I can't accept the risk
of accepting their code.
And no, this is not "been beaten over the head by IP lawyers for three
years about risks like this" portion of me talking, although that side
does have a lot he could say about this situation...
