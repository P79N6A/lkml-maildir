Just before the Fedora kernel got 4K stacks (which was before mainline),
in stress testing, I was hitting memory allocation bugs far sooner than
I was hitting stack overflows, so I don't think this claim has any bearing on reality.
It was far more commonplace for the kernel to struggle to find a free pair
of contiguous pages under extreme load.  And as already mentioned,
those overflows _can_ be hit with an 8KB stack too, you just have to
try harder.
The 'real benefits' you aren't seeing are lots of failing order-1 allocations
under moderate to heavy load. You don't even need big iron boxes to see this,
(in fact, its easier to hit this problem on smaller underpowered boxes).
