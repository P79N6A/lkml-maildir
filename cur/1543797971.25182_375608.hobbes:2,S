I agree with this.
I also would like to add that, the exported symbol may not always be
in the same module. Imagine if Module A is loaded and Module B would
export one symbol with the same symbol name as a symbol in Module A,
then the symbol exported by Module B would still go through. Now
Imagine if that symbol does something like a kmem_cache_create of an
existing cache!!
I feel this is a security loophole and preventing duplicate *exported*
symbols in the kernel, might just solve it.
