Yes, agree totally,  i386 _requires_ asm/segment.h.  It is used in 
low-level trap handling and bootup code from assembly files.  In 
addition, even parts of userspace on i386 depend on asm/segment.h, 
although that is a different beast.
It is a total bug if generic drivers include it, there is simply no 
reason to use segment.h unless you have to use segmentation.  Ideally, 
all includes of segment.h should be confined to architectures that 
require it, and limited to either arch/foo or include/asm-foo.
I'm looking at -rc6-mm1, and I see the following bad guys:
./drivers/char/mxser.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/char/speakup/speakup_drvcommon.c:#include <asm/segment.h>     
/* for put_user_byte */
./drivers/isdn/hisax/hisax.h:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/media/video/adv7170.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/media/video/adv7175.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/media/video/bt819.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/media/video/bt856.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/media/video/saa7111.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/media/video/saa7114.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/media/video/saa7185.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/serial/68328serial.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
./drivers/serial/crisv10.c:#include <asm/segment.h>
