Subject: kbuild - building a module/target from multiple directories

With kbuild in 2.5, how do I specify that a module/target is to be built of
object files and sub-directories ?
The "obvious" approach :
obj-$(CONFIG_BLAH) := blah.o
blah-objs := blah_init.o blahstuff/
doesn't work. Is there an example of a module doing this ?
findall Makefile | xargs grep '+=' | grep -- -objs | awk -F: '{print $2}' | grep /
isn't promising ...
I'd like to avoid the awkwardness of multiple modules and the
unpleasantness of too many files in a single directory
thanks
john
