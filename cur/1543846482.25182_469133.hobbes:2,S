I wonder whether the code in question was supposed to be running at all.  
Arkadiusz, what sort of USB devices do you have attached to the computer?
What does /proc/bus/usb/devices say (you may need to do "mount -t usbfs
none /proc/bus/usb" before you can see the file)?

In principle that data could be coming from anywhere.  It doesn't have to 
be related at all to uhci-hcd.
If you move the USB devices over to another Linux computer, does the new 
computer then have the same problem?
