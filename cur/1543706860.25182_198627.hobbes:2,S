thanks for the info, I read/tested that one too, some time
ago, but decided against this approach, as it builds the
glibc, which I do not need for the kernel toolchain at all
and I didn't want to bother with another source that won't
compile on arch xy ... maybe the wrong decision? I don't 
know ...
best,
Herbert
