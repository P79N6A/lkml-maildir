Jeff Garzik replied with this:
Are you using the Rusty's modutils, or the old, no-longer-works-with-2.5 
modutils?
i was still using modutils 2.4.19  so that is the problem.
i asked jeff where the new modutils is and he replied:
search for Rusty's module-related patches on lkml, I don't have a URL 
handy, sorry :(
They don't work with 2.4.x... currently there is a hack solution where 
Rusty's modutils "make install" renames the current modutils to 
<program>.old.  Then when you run Rusty's modprobe, if it's a 2.4 
kernel, the program will do nothing more than exec modprobe.old.  (I 
don't like it that way, but such as it is with a development kernel...)
anybody have the url for these new modutils?
