If you are always going to send unicast messages, then  -ECONNREFUSED
will tell you the listener has closed their fd - this doesnt meant it
has exited. Besides that one process could open several sockets. I know
that would not be the app you would write - but it doesnt stop other
people from doing it.
I think i may not follow what you are doing - for some reason i thought
you may have many listeners in user space and these messages get
multicast to them?
Does the user space program somehow communicate its pid to the kernel?
