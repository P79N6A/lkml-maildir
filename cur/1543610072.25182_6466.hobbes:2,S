Running 2.4.15pre5.  I start up UML 2.4.14 and see that the host
threads representing UML processes do not die when complete.  I
get an ever increasing number of [linux] lines in ps listing.
kill -9 has no effect.
Removing the kernel/exit.c patch @ line 539, this behavior goes
away.  I am running a UP kernel if that makes any difference.
This may be a dup - I didn't see my original message on the
archive.
