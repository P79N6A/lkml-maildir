To me it looks that the original style in this file can be sacrificed
in favor of
1) satisfying the coding style rules of the kernel;
2) keeping with informal, but commonly known idioms of C language.
So I thought that while you're at it, you could also comb through
this file and make the checkpatch.pl script happy with it.
But this is just my very personal opinion :)
