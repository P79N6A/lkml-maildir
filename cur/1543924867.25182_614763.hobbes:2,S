Hi Andrew,
Following a discussion with Linus, here is the implementation of the
kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation removal. The result of the discussion has been
to decide to move the architecture dependent instrumentation menu entries to
arch/Kconfig and enable/disable each option on a per architecture basis with a
Kconfig boolean. I moved the architecture independent instrumentation items to
init/Kconfig.
Mathieu
