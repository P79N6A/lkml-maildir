OK, looks like:
	a) ->check_media_change() is screwed for that device.
	b) we are hanging on something interesting.  It isn't ->s_umount
and it's very unlikely to be ->s_lock or mount_sem.  What it might be,
though... I suspect that ->bd_sem is screwed.
	Could you reproduce the hang and then do Alt-Sysrq-T?  That should
give you stack traces.  I'm especially interested in stack trace of hung
mount(8).  It's nice to know that it ends on down(), but knowing what had
called that down() would help big way.
