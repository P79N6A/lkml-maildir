Since when do Linux developers resist changes?

Had it been pushed harder, they probably would have done it.

The different naming was one thing i liked about devfs.  Go read the
archives from a couple of years ago, and see that the exact same
arguments that were used to promote devfs, are now said to be bad
things.  This sudden change is what I don't understand, and how the
not-working udev is supposed to be able to replace devfs.
