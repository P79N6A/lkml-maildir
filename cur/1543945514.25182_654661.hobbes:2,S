As the one who sent such a cleanup sometime ago I think I've rights to
say my POV ;)
Benefits
--------
I think all developers would agree with me that to have a clean code is
quite good. Even removing absolutely useless 'spaces' is good. Ingo
wrote a lot about such a benefit month ago - and I think most (or even
all) of developers agree with him. Actually I've
(show-trailing-whitespace t) in my emacs settings - so every useless
space char makes me nerve - of course I could turn this setting off
and be happy but...
Dark side of space-removing-patches
-----------------------------------
The only problem could be - such a cleanup would break patches
*already* in maintainer queue. And from that side I really understand
Andi's complains about such patches.
