My version of ps doesn't seem to support spid, but by dropping it I got
the thread pids anyway.

And so it does. Annoying. Time to hack kernel to add a new scheduling
policy, SCHED_STAYIDLE, which is like SCHED_IDLE but cannot be unset
except by root.
Can't make it the default, since a program running at SCHED_IDLE in a
machine with 100% CPU usage by some other program will never process
SIGKILL, and thus can only be killed by setting its scheduling policy to
normal...
Darn obnoxious program, SetiAtHome...
