Hi,
Does anyone have any experience with sniffing data from a serial port w/o the device attached to the serial port or the application having knowledge of this ?
I had found an old kernel module (for 2.2.0, i think) called 'maxty' which would does this.  Is there something equivalent for the 2.6.x kernels ?
Or is there a better way to go about doing this?
