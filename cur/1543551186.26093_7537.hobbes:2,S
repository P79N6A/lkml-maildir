2.2.18pre15's NFS support looks strange to me. My menuconfig screen
looks like this:
  x x       <*> NFS filesystem support
  x x       <*> NFS server support
  x x       [ ]    Emulate SUN NFS server
  x x       [*]    NFS Version 3
While 2.2.17 + Trond's + Dave's NFSv3 patches looks like this:
  x x       <*> NFS filesystem support
  x x       [*]    NFS Version 3 filesystem support
  x x       <*> NFS server support
  x x       [*]    NFS Version 3 server support (EXPERIMENTAL)
It looks as if the NFS v3 Server patches did not make it, but they make
up the part that is actually interesting for interoperability, with e.
g. Solaris. 
Frankly, I don't personally care for Linux NFS v3 client support, the
server patches are the interesting part. They get Linux rid of the
long-awaited SysV-NFS-client incompatibilities.
Did you merge Dave Higgens' NFS v3 Server patches completely? Did you
reject parts of the patches?
