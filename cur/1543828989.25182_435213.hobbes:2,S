Nope, same conflict with CONFIG_RESOURCES_32BIT set.  You're right, it
is deciding that 0xF8B0200E conflicts with that range:
conflict: PCI IO[0->ffff] conflicts with ide2[f8b3c00e->f8b3c00e]
Looking at the code, I don't understand how this could have worked in
-rc6; __request_resource hasn't changed, and it says
    167         if (end < start)
    168                 return root;
    169         if (start < root->start)
    170                 return root;
    171         if (end > root->end)
    172                 return root;
If root-> start == 0 and root->end == 0xffff, we should always hit line
172, unless sign extension is in effect... and all the variables are
unsigned long in -rc6, so that doesn't make sense.
Rebooting into -rc6 with some debugging...
