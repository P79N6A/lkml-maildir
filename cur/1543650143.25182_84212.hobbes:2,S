In the Configure HELP of Ethernet bridging:
"Note that if your box acts as a bridge, it probably contains several
 Ethernet devices, but the kernel is not able to recognize more than one at
 boot time without help; for details read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
 in <
http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>."
This is extremely bogus these days and prone to confuse people. I suggest
this warning is removed.
Kind regards,
