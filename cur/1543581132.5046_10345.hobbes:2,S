Are your drives connected to the VIA or the Promise controller? Mine
are both connected to the PDC20265 and running in UDMA-100 mode. There
have been several threads on lkml about corruption on disks connected
to Via chipset IDE controllers, although I didn't follow them in great
detail. Maybe your problem is not related to the host bridge, but to
the IDE controller?
