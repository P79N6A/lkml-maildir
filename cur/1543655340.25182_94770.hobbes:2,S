The original poster should still have access to 896MB of RAM even with
highmem off. Something else is actually wrong. (I don't have any useful
ideas for troubleshooting it though.)

You could say the difference between "586" and "686" is essentially the
difference between the original Pentium and the Pentium Pro.
Thus the original Pentium, and its variant the Pentium MMX, are 586.
The Pentium Pro, and its variants the Pentium II and III (and their
Celeron variants too) are 686. The Pentium IV identifies itself as
a 1586 (as has been mentioned on this list in the past, it's a bad
pun involving roman numerals), but Linux considers that to be 686.
I hope that helps.
