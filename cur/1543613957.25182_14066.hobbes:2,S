Subject: [BUG] cramfs+initrd: BOOM! (Re: ramdisk corruption problems)

[fifth (!) attempt, previous mails did not show up on lkml]
[This msg definitely does not want to make it into the list :-)]
At last I have found one definite bug (maybe there are others).
I was unable to load a minix initrd on any 2.4.12+ kernel. 2.4.10 is fine.
Thanks to Mike Galbraith <mikeg@wen-online.de> who said that he can load 
minix initrds and sent me both .config and initrd. I found out that with his 
.config I indeed can load my initrd. After many recompilations and reboots 
(binary search :-) it turned out that compiled-in support for cramfs caused
initrds to be corrupted.
[update since 3rd attempt to reach lkml]
I did some debugging in fs/cramfs/inode.c:cramfs_read_super()
If I plant immediate "return 0;" there initrd loads.
If I place "return 0;" after "set_blocksize(sb->s_dev, PAGE_CACHE_SIZE);"
- BOOM! Kernel panic. Restoring blocksize to 1024 prior to return does NOT 
help.
[end update]
This is the diff between 'good' and 'bad' .config:
