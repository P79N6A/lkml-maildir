Hi Mike, Rik, Everyone,
The O(1) schedule just isn't fair.  It will run a subset 
of the runable processes excluding the rest.  See my earlier
emails for the details.
I had been working on a fix for this but got distracted
by Posix timers.  I still hope to get back to it.
My patch is here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103508412423719&w=2
It fixes fairness but breaks nice(2). Rik van Riel has a
patch here which builds on my patch which fixes this:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103651801424031&w=2
I just gave this a spin with.  The patches still apply cleanly
to linux-2.5.48 and it seems well behaved:-)  
I found this problem with the LTP waitpid06 test.  It actually
produced a live-lock. See this mail:
