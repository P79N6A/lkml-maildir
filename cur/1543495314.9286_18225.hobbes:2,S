It seems that it's a bit too late to write this but I'll try anyway...

I written this proggy to check the issue:
main()
{
	if (1 & 2 && 1)
		printf("ciao\n");
}
(1 & 2) && 1 =
0 && 1 = 0 -> no print ciao infact
if it would been:
1 & (2 && 1) =
1 & 1 = 1 -> should print "ciao" according to you but it doesn't.
What am I missing?
