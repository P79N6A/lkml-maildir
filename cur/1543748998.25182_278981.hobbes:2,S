Yes, it would certainly be interesting. 5% power savings, and no
singing capacitors, while keeping HZ=1000. Sounds good to me.
There are about 1000 timers available in PC, each having its own
quirks. CMOS clock should be able to generate 1024Hz periodic timer
(we currently do not use) and TSC we currently use for periodic timer
should be usable in single-shot mode.
