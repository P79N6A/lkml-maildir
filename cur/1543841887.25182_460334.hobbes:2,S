My bad. I got confused with your eight registers. ;)

I smell premature optimisation. Besides, the compiler is probably better
than you at unraveling that loop in an efficient manner anyway. You
should generally start with readable and obviously correct code and
optimise only when bottle necks are found. It keeps the code
maintainable in the long run.
As for the readw(), it was because you said only 16 of the 32 bits
contained anything of value.

Great. That should allow even the most inexperienced reader to
understand the code.

Should be ready for merge then. We just need to sort out exactly where
to put the files. And Russell probably wants his say in this as well. ;)
