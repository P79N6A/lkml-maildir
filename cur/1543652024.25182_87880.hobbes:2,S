Daniel is correct in that the issue came up recently.  He
gives _his_ answer above.  If you believe in security
through obscurity you will agree with him.  I don't.
I will agree that there should be no real reason to need
access to this information.
With ACLs you will be able to explicitly grant access and
you won't have to depend on keeping shared info secret.
Then this will be less of an issue.
