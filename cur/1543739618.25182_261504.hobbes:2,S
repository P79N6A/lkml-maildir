Ok. I also modified the second occurence of that comment.

Hmm.. I cannot see a good reason for it either. The page is new
and thus no references can exist yet. Removed.

Ahh. Thanks.

The pte value is saved in entry. If the pte is umapped then its value is
changed. Thus the cmpxchg will fail and the page fault handler will return
without doing anything.
try_to_unmap_one was modified to handle the pte's in an atomic way using
ptep_xchg.
