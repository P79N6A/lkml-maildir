Hello,
  Quite many people seem to have taken interest at the so called
``Large File Summit'' support for 32-bit Linux -- most of the Linux
systems are 32-bitters, after all..
I have now adapted my LFS patch for 2.2.0-pre8 (the final pre8)
for the brave testers out there!
It is available at:
 
ftp://mea.ipv6.tmt.tele.fi/linux/LFS/
and for those without 6BONE connectivity:
 
ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/linux/LFS/
