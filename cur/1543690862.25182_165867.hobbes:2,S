It's unrelated to Hermes.
Turning off CONFIG_ISA drops out a chunk of code to do with ISA support,
including support for ISA-style interrupts from PCMCIA.  However, PCMCIA
cards are still useful if your cardbus socket routes PCMCIA card
interrupts to the PCI interrupt.
What I basically need to do (when I get around to it) is to work out
a decent way to handle routing the cardbus/pcmcia interrupts according
to what resources are available.  But alas, time is a commodity which
I'm sorely lacking at the moment.
So for the moment, if you want to use PCMCIA cards, always ensure you
have CONFIG_ISA turned on.
