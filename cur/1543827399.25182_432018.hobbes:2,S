The whole purpose of marking a function __init is to place in in a
section that can be discarded after init. This has the added advantage
that it kills off some ugly #ifdef MODULE / #endif as is the case for
ne.c
Even if not discarded then the code cleaniness is preferable to #ifdef /
#endif if purpose is only to save a few bytes.
Shifting to module_init(), module_cleanup() is the only right thing to
do - and the old behaviour is not even documented in LDD3 anymore.
[At least I did not find it last time I searched].
