Hmm. So it appears that my patch wastes 2 ulongs per input handle
then, in the name of preventing oopses. OK.

Don't worry about this too much, I can always retest and resubmit,
as long as the main idea is agreeable to you. My users are on RHEL.
Therefore, my main concern is to get something into your tree in
order to avoid this regressing in the future. Meanwhile, users of
our 2.6.9 and 2.6.18 forks get a version of this patch.
