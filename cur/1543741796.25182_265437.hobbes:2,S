2.6.10.1 suggests nothing, that convention was used ONCE in the 2.6 
series. I liked the -pre convention as it was, but Linus has dropped 
that in spite of several hundred instances of its use. From that I 
conclude that if Linus like 2.6.10.1 he will use it, and if not we will 
have -rc releases which aren't release candidates. His call.
I personally think it will slow development because some people tested 
the -rc releases harder, but that's not decided by vote.
