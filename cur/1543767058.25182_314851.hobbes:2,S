You seem to make a confusion here...
Don't forget that files are only an abstraction for userspace. They are 
only meant to be read and written from userspace. Kernel code can never 
read or write files. In the case of /var/log/messages, this file is 
created by the syslogd program from the kernel buffer, not by the kernel 
itself.
You could just echo something specific to your driver in your printk 
strings, and grep this specific thing in /var/log/messages. You have 
your file!
    Cheers,
    Michael.
