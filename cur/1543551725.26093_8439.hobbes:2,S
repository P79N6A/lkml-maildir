IMO, that's just good software engineering to remove that kind of stuff.

I've been starting to think that this is almost a gauntlet that is being thrown
down.  The topic comes up from time to time and there is always a zeolous repsonse,
not the "you're an idiot, read the archives" response.  If you say something is
stupid and that it can't do it or it shouldn't be done enough times your will
always find someone stupid enough to do that hard work and do it for you.
Technical issues aside, I think it would be cool (not always practical or
technically good, but cool) to be able to simply subclass a device driver and add a
method or two and have a working driver.
