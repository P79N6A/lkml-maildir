Hello,
Does the lookup() method for a filesystem need to add negative dentry for
the case when filename is too long or should it d_add() a negative dentry
(inode=NULL). 
Minix adds negative dentry by making minix_find_entry() fail and 
effectively doing d_add(dentry, NULL) and returning NULL.
Ext2 returns ERR_PTR(-ENAMETOOLONG) from ext2_lookup().
Which one is right? If I knew dcache internals well enough I would be able
to make the right decision.
Does anyone have a suggestion?
Thanks,
Tigran.
