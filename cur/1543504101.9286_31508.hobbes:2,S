And, in case of people would ignore it, I have had to diagnose the problem 
by myself and I donnot have an Alpha machine, neither really know of the 
Alpha stuff, since the solution was very slow to come.
The solution is known since almost a week, and I didn't see any official
fix for it posted to the lists by the maintainers of the offending code. 
If the reason is that this bad changes in the pyxis_core stuff only affect
the sym53c8xx devices and only on Alpha machines and thus guys think it is
not important, then they just appear as not interesting people to me. I am
wondering about what would have happened facing a bad change that affected
also (or only) Adaptec devices on Intel platforms.
