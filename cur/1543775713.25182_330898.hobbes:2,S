Dunno if there's something that explicitly only parks the head, the best
option is probably to issue a STANDBY_NOW command. You can test this
with hdparm -y.
Generel observation on this driver - why isn't it just contained in user
space? You need to do the monitoring and sending of ide commands from
there anyways, I don't see the point of putting it in the kernel.
