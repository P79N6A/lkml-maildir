Yeah, I can't argue with you there. I was under the impression that we
would be dealing with this strictly as a second class solution to see
what it bought to help steer the direction of fsblock.

As you say, a difference is if we fail to allocate a hugepage, the world
does not end. It's been a well known problem for years and grouping pages
by mobility is aimed at relaxing some of the more painful points. It has
other uses as well, but each of them is expected to deal with failures with
contiguous range allocation.

If the mmap() change is bad, then it gets halted up.

I don't agree with using higher order pages to fix SLUB vs SLAB performance
issues either. SLUB has to be able to compete with SLAB on it's own terms. If
SLUB gains x% over SLAB in specialised cases with high orders, then fair
enough but minimally, SLUB has to perform the same as SLAB at order-0. Like
you, I think if we depend on SLUB using high orders to match SLAB, we are
going to get kicked further down the line.
However, this discussion belongs more with the non-existant-remove-slab patch.
Based on what we've seen since the summits, we need a thorough analysis
with benchmarks before making a final decision (kernbench, ebizzy, tbench
(netpipe if someone has the time/resources), hackbench and maybe sysbench
as well as something the filesystem people recommend to get good coverage
of the subsystems).

I'd rather not get side-tracked here. I regret you feel stream-rolled but I
think grouping pages by mobility is the right thing to do for better usage
of the TLB by the kernel and for improving hugepage support in userspace
minimally. We never really did see eye-to-eye but this way, if I'm wrong
you get to chuck eggs down the line.

So are we saying the right thing to do is go with fs-block from day 1 once we
get it to optimistically use high-order pages? I think your concern might be
that if this goes in then it'll be harder to justify fsblock in the future
because it'll be solving a theoritical problem that takes months to trigger
if at all. i.e. The filesystem people will push because apparently large
block support as it is solves world peace. Is that accurate?

That may be a good enough reason on it's own to delay this. It's a
technical provable point.

What a co-incidence :)

I think they use vmapping because they have to, not because they want
to. They might be a lot happier with fsblock if it used contiguous pages
for large blocks whenever possible - I don't know for sure. The metadata
accessors they might be unhappy with because it's inconvenient but as
Christoph Hellwig pointed out at VM/FS, the filesystems who really care
will convert.

Virtually mapping the entire kernel is still off the table. We don't have
recent figures but the last measured slowdown I'm aware of was in the 5-10%
range for kernbench when we break 1:1 virt:phys mapping althought that
may be because we also lose hugepage backing of the kernel portion of the
address space. I didn't look deeply at the time because it was bad
whatever the root cause.

heh, fair enough. I guess that minimally, the leaders need warnings all
over the place as well or else we're going back to the drawing board or all
getting behind fs-block (or Andrea's of it comes to that) and pushing.

I might regret saying this, but it would be easier to craft an attack
using pagetable pages. It's woefully difficult to do but it's probably
doable. I say pagetables because while slub targetted reclaim is on the
cards and memory compaction exists for page cache pages, pagetables are
currently pinned with no prototype patch existing to deal with them.

If we hit this problem at all, it'll be due to gradual natural degredation.
It used to be a case that jumbo ethernets reported problems after running
for weeks and we might encounter something similar with large blocks while it
lacks a fallback. We no longer see jumbo ethernet reports but the fact is we
don't know if it's because we fixed it or people gave up. Chances are people
will be more persistent with large blocks than they were with jumbo ethernet.

I'm happy to go with their decision on this one as well unless Andrea says
he hates it simply on the grounds he wants the PAGE_SIZE_SHIFT solution :)

If the FS people really want it and they insist that this has to be a
#1 citizen then it's fsblock or make something new up. I'm still not 100%
convinced that Andrea's solution is immune from fragmentation problems. Also,
I don't think a virtually mapped and 100% defraggable kernel is going to
perform very well or I'd have gone down that road already.

Even if the conversion is hard but only a few days work per filesystem,
it's difficult to argue against on any grounds other than name calling.
