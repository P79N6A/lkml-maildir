"self-appointed"? 
Are you implying that the people who run ORBS and the other RBL lists 
actually hacked into vger.kernel.org and changed the MTA configuration to 
use those lists? I was of the opinion that it was a free choice made by the 
administrators of that machine.
Or are you just spouting random shite?
Can we take this pointlessness off l-k now please?
