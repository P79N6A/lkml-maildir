This behavior sets in after the box is up for some period of time. I don't think this is related to the 686a configuration reset bug.
I suspect that do_gettimeoffset() may be, on occasion,
returning a negative number.  The normalizing code then
works with this (unsigned) value until it is < 1,000,000. 
If it came back as -1, this would generate an error of about
1.19 hours.  I suspect the best fix would be to test the
result from do_gettimeoffset() for something greater than
say 20ms and if so set it to 0.

I would like to get to the bottom of this problem, but am not familiar with this part of the timing infrastructure. Has anyone seen this bug before? Would using a different locking mode (SMP  vs none SMP, or wahtever) possibly help this problem? Is there a document online describing how this works in Linux?
