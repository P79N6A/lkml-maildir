Perhaps better wording:
A kset is also represented via a subdirectory in sysfs, under which the
kobjects associated with the kset can show up.

Hm, the default attributes are provided by the ktype?

Maybe also mention kset_get()/kset_put() here? kset_unregister() will
only destroy the kset if the caller holds the last reference to it.

It may be helpful to mention which uevents are by default created by
the kobject core (KOBJ_ADD, KOBJ_DEL, KOBJ_MOVE).

There is no field called "refcount"; the embedded struct kref kref is
initialized by kobject_init().

Do we also want to mention kobject_rename() and kobject_move(), or are
those functions so esoteric that most people don't want to know about
them?
