Could you explain why this patch makes any difference?
grep shows the only user of nohz_cpu_mask in arch/s390/kernel/time.c,
start_hz_timer() and stop_hz_timer().
I can't see how this change can prevent idle cpus to be included in
->cpumask, cpu can add itself to nohz_cpu_mask right after some other
cpu started new grace period.
I think cpu should call cpu_quiet() after adding itself to nohz mask
to eliminate this race.
No?
Oleg.
