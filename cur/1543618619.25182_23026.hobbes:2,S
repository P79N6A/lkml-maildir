.. and it probably serializes the instruction stream.
Look at the patch.
The _only_ thing it does for the system call path is:
 - remove the "cli"
 - change
	cmpl $0,..
	jne
	cmp $0,..
	jne
   into
	movl ..,reg
	testl reg,reg
	jne
and the latter may be worth a cycle (or two, if the CPU happens to like
the second form better for some other reason), but it's certainly not
noticeable.
A 3.4% improvement is equivalent to something like 9 cycles, so the "cli"
being faster on Athlon than on a PIII certainly explains why it's less
noticeable on the Athlon, but it still makes me suspect that the _real_
cost of the cli is on the order of 8 cycles.
It should be eminently testable. Just remove the cli from the standard
kernel, and do before-and-after tests.
