Yea, you're right about the inlining. Although I'm not sure why those
functions should take microseconds to execute. That's very strange.

Basically its there to detect if the cpu goes into a low power mode and
halts the TSC. 
They probably could be #defined if C3 really cannot triggered, but some
check will be necessary otherwise.
The arch specific bits in my patches have gotten less of my attention
recently, but hopefully with the arch generic code getting pretty solid
and fast I'll be back to focusing on it.
