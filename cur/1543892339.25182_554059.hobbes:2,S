1. I use netconsole on almost all of my machines.
2. When I reboot one of them, it sends the kernel messages to the console
    logging server.
3. However, whenever I reboot it spams the console and every xterm open
    with the following:

I also tried:
# Send p34 messages to their own file.
@192.168.0.1        /var/log/p34.log
But no luck here either.
Do I need to be running some sort of special netconsole server and send to 
a different port to avoid this spam?
Justin.
