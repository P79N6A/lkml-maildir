I'm wondering is how is that GNU "owns" those utils... from recent grep on
gcc Changelog I didn't see much contributed by GNU(mainly rms)besides
bunch of configuration changes to change unknown to pc and linux to
linux-guess in config.guess and few changes in getloadavg.c. So how does
GNU owns those utils, I thought the point of GNU was that nobody owned
something exculsively.
