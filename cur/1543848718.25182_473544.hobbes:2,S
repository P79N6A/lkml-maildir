First of all, kernel and userland don't have to be in the same address
space at all; not even on x86 in some configuration.  So dereferencing
user pointer as if it had been a normal pointer simply won't work - what
you'll get might have nothing to do with any user memory.
But even aside of that, even on architectures where kernel and userland
_do_ share address space, there's nothing to guarantee that any given
piece of user address space is currently present or has ever been paged
in to start with.
Dereference that and you'll get an exception.  If you take a look at
the guts of e.g. arch/i386/lib/usercopy.c, you'll see stuff going to
.fixup section; when you call e.g. get_user() on address in a page that
is currently not paged in, exception *is* generated and handled; then
control is returned back to where we'd taken it.
IOW, even low-level code on such targets has to be careful; blind dereferencing
would simply get you an oops.  On something like ppc it's simply out of
question - there you would be able to trigger reads from memory-mapped
registers of hell knows what hardware.  From userland.  Confusing the
living fsck out of hardware and drivers...  _And_ you'd get access to
genuine kernel data.
