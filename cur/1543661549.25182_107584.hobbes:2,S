Would kernel hackers care if Monta Vista stopped contributing its kernel
development to the community entirely, but give it only to its customers?
Customers always had the source for every GPL binaries being distributed.  
That's for section 3a of the GPL so things are clear.
Now it should be said that Monta Vista is giving away to the community most
of its kernel changes, and even preaching for their inclusion in Linus' tree
or the different architecture specific projects.  That's beyond the GPL
requirements.  When that doesn't happen, it's usually because the code is
either too ugly for general acceptance, of low usefulness but to one
specific customer, or because the customer asked not to publish, or due to a
lack of time to process say source.
