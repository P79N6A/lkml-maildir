You're right, I should have sent this to netdev as well.  I'm Sorry.
As for early and often, I have posted all of these patches to netdev,
and made suggested changes, and re-posted.
And when I have other networking changes, you can bet they'll get sent
to netdev for review first before I think about asking that they be
included.

For several rounds, I've been posting patches that go nowhere.  I
honestly don't care if they go straight to Linus, through you, or
through Andrew.
