Hi,
Andrew Morton:

Correct; see below.

Testing... yes, both.

That's easy:
2.6.17    -Using pmtmr for high-res timesource
2.6.18git +Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
I missed those two lines, as in the boot logs they're not really
adjacent, so they got lost in the jumble of other differences.
Interestingly, CPU0/1 gets 6000 bogomips while CPU2/3 only reaches 5600 ..?
(That happens with both kernels.) I do wonder why, and whether this has any
bearing on the current problem.
