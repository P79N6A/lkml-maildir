Like everything else in life, it's a balance.  If something is clearly 
half-baked and requires a bunch of post-rc1 changes just to be usable, a 
revert might make a lot of sense.
It's questions of: how much further change is required, how invasive are 
those changes, how half-baked and incomplete is the feature really, what 
is the downside of a revert, ...
