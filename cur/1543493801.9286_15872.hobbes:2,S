I think all of the above.  However, as has been pointed out, one's idea of
perf-tuning is different from another's, comparing what's quoted above to
what's quoted below.  For example, I think of perf-tuning in terms of
network data transfers:

I think it should be as broad as possible, but it would also have to be
very well organized:  system tuning, network tuning, video-subsys tuning,
etc.
