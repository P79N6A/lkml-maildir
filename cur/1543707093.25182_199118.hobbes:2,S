Alas, once userspace has migrated to doing everything in UTF-8, you
won't be able to read those files because userspace will barf on them.
Then you'll be glad to have a mount option which converts iso-8859-1
to UTF-* :)  (Even if the old disk as actually not iso-8859-1, at least
you'll be able to read it's mangled filenames, rather than userspace
tripping over them).
