this isn't a radical API change actually, and.. well there is no kernel
ABI. If you care about ABI.. that breaks all the time anyway. Not just a
little bit, but highly radical.

There is no 2.7, and the current development model also is that there
won't be one until the development model changes.

the funny thing is that this is a very localized change compared to many
of the other things going on, and unlikely to cause any major issues
with the kernel code. And the changes have clear gains in size and
probably also in speed (segment accesses are not cheap)
So personally I don't think your objections make sense in todays
reality.
