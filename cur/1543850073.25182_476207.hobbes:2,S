I also think that this is the best solution. It would be nice to have
that documented somewhere. Maybe in the Documentation directory
something like:
Howto export data in virtual files
==================================
If you want to export data to userspace via virtual filesystems
like procfs, sysfs, debugfs etc., the following rules are recommended:
- Export only one value in one virtual file.
- Data format should be as simple as possible.
- Use ASCII formated strings, no binary data if possible.
- If data has dimension units, encode that in the filename.
  Please use the following suffixes:
  * kb: Kilobytes
  * mb: Megabytes
  * ms: Milliseconds
  * us: Microseconds
  * ns: Nanoseconds
  * ...
Examples:
---------
> ls /sys/mydata
memory_kb
online_time_ms
> cat /sys/mydata/memory_kb
