So how about facing the fact that my "vmalloc()" approach actually solves
all these issues. The memory is visible to the rest of the system (few
things care about it right now, but it _is_ accounted for and things like
/dev/kmem will actually see it etc).
And the vmalloc() approach is even portable, so one of the two phases is 
something that is totally generic (and the second phase is almost totally 
architecture-dependent anyway).
