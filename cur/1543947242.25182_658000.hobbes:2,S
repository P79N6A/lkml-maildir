Post patches! I can't review a git tree..

>    cpuisol: Make cpu isolation configrable and export isolated map
cpu_isolated_map was a bad hack when it was introduced, I feel we should
deprecate it and fully integrate the functionality into cpusets. That would
give a much more flexible end-result.
CPU-sets can already isolate cpus by either creating a cpu outside of any set,
or a set with a single cpu not shared by any other sets.
This also allows for isolated groups, there are good reasons to isolate groups,
esp. now that we have a stronger RT balancer. SMP and hard RT are not
exclusive. A design that does not take that into account is too rigid.

A better approach would be to add a flag to the cpuset infrastructure that says
whether its a system set or not. A system set would be one that services the
general purpose OS and would include things like the IRQ affinity and unbound
kernel threads (including unbound workqueues - or single workqueues). This flag
would default to on, and by switching it off for the root set, and a select
subset you would push the System away from those cpus, thereby isolating them.

I still strongly disagree with this approach. Workqueues are passive, they
don't do anything unless work is provided to them. By blindly not starting them
you handicap the system and services that rely on them.
(you even acknowledged this problem, by saying it breaks oprofile for instance
- still trying to push a change that knowingly breaks a lot of stuff is bad
manners on lkml and not acceptable for mainline)
The way to do this is to avoid the generation of work, not the execution of it.

No idea about these patches,...

Very strong NACK on this one, it breaks a lot of functionality in non-obvious
ways, as has been pointed out to you numerous times. Such patches are just not
acceptable for mainline - full stop.
Please, the ideas are not bad and have been suggested in the context of -rt a
number of times, its just the execution. Design features so that they are
flexible and can be used in ways you never imagined them. But more
importantly so that they don't knowingly break tons of stuff.
