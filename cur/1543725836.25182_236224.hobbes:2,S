   which means that now iPod automatically connects to firewire (and 
looses info on random tracks, sometime some other settings), instead of 
only connecting when I try to actually access it (the device).
   it looks like there is no user level (end user, not admin) control on 
when the device drivers are loaded anymore - or is there?
   Is there any way to load drivers on demand (obviously it's not job of 
udev but whose job it is?). What about unloading them - I unmount the 
disk and i think the iPod is disconnecred but it still says connected - 
is there any way to disconnect it (I guess similar problems arise with 
other hotplug devices)
