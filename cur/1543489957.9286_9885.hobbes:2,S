(i only pointed out that TSC bugs/inconsistencies (which happened in the
past) now might have yet another side-effect. [there was a robustness
claim])

(do you know about any such legitimate use. I've used such things myself
in the APIC code, it's not legitimate and i've fixed it.)

(You have added 30 lines of code, i've removed 20. Thats a 50 lines
difference.)

the SCSI case is pure paranoia and an unmaintained subsystem. Fixing (one
of ) the effects of overlong cli() just delays the real fix. (why should
we bother fixing them when system time runs just fine) Some other
side-effects of overlong clis, apart from lost timer ticks: lost
characters on the serial line, lost keyboard events. If someone doing
strange things can live with these other effects, he sure can live with
lost timer ticks as well.
