Probably everyone will agree on that.

Except for the fact that remote wakeup kicks in only when a device is 
suspended.

It would be nice, wouldn't it?  But we _already_ have several vastly
different power-management APIs.  Consider for example DPMI and IDE 
spindown.

Why shouldn't a device always be put into a power-saving mode whenever it 
isn't open?  Agreed, you might want to reduce its power usage at times 
even when it is open...

Yes.  It has to be decided by each individual driver.  For simple 
character-oriented devices, "open" is a good first start.
