Nobody replied to this message.  I am a little confused.  I guess
there are several possibilities :
1. People agree with me
2. People are not interested
3. People don't really know
I suppose in either case it seems to make sense for me to submit
a patch.  Such a patch means a lot to embedded systems without 
hurting the performance of desktop systems at all.
Any suggestions?
