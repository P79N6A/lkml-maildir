  usb-uhci.o locks my laptop immediately following insmod.  The last message
received (to console) is:
PCI: Enabling device 00:07.2 (0000 -> 0001)
  usbcore, usb-uhci, and mouse worked (works) fine under 2.3.25.  Nothing USB
related is sent to the syslog before the lockup.
  Here is the syslog data from the working 2.3.25 version:
