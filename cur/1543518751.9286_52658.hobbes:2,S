I've not looked through all of the SGI patches, but several of them won't be
going in at least for a while. The raw I/O directly into the scsi mid layer
for example is not good maintainable layering. 
I expect like a lot of code to see it evolve and clean up then in some future
form to maybe become a kernel candidate.
