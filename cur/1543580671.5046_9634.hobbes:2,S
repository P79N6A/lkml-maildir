Hi Alex!
	I'm a little confused here... why are we overrunning? This thing is 
running externally at 19200 at best, even if it does all come in as a 
packet. I would think the flip buffer would never contain more than a 
few characters. Are you running it at a higher rate internally? Does it 
buffer up a whole packet if you do this?
Wouldn't it be a little easier to drop somthing like "AT#MRU=500\r" to 
the modem than to change the tty driver?
