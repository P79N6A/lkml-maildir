Isn't/wasn't 2.5 meant as a development release ? And 2.4 was meant as production, 
but certainly had more iterations than you would have expected of such.
If 2.5 is a development-release, I would not expect distros to pick it up
any time soon - just like they never shipped anything with 2.3. Even when
SuSE started shipping 2.4.0, the distro carried a clear recommendation of
using 2.2.18.
There are significant differences in the way Linux development happens and 
the way in which commercial software is release-managed. It's a fact. 
If Linux kernel development were to stick with the initial idea that odd releases 
are development, even are production, then it might be easier to keep up. In 
which case itexcinc would perhaps now be looking at 2.5x with an aim of releasing
drivers for 2.6.

Wishful thinking - people who understand the importance of which chipset on which
board are usually not employed as shop-assistants.

PS: I'm all for the main point that's being argued here - but I do understand 
itexcinc's point of view.
