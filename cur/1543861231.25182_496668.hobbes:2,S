If you open Y, this open file descriptor will guarantee that no distinct
file will have the same inode number while all hardliked files must have
the same inode number. (AFAIK)
Now you will check this against the list of hardlink candidates using the
stored inode number. If the inode number has changed, this will result in
a false negative. If you removed X, recreated it with the same inode number
and linked that to Y, you'll get a false positive (which could be identified
by the [mc]time changes).
Samefile without keeping the files open will result in the same false
positive as open+fstat+stat, while samefile with keeping the files open
will occasionally overflow the files table, Therefore I think it's not
worth while introducing samefile as long as the inode is unique for open
files. OTOH you'll want to keep the inode number as stable as possible,
since it's the only sane way to find sets of hardlinked files and some
important programs may depend on it.
