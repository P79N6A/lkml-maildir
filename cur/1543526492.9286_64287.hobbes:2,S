I've been experiencing the following problem after upgrading my system
from Suse 6.2 (kernel 2.2.10) to Suse 6.3 (kernel 2.2.13). I am unable
to read audio from the CD-ROM and get the following messages 
CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMVOLCTRL errno=38
CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMREADTOCHDR errno=38
CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMREADTOCHDR errno=38
CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMREADTOCHDR errno=38
CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/cdrom: cmd=CDROMREADTOCHDR errno=38
TOC ERROR: No Disc ID found at /usr/bin/ripit.pl line 209, <CDTOC> chunk 1.
This occurs with whatever CD audio program I use (the above error came
from using ripit, but the same happens with cda, xmcd, kscd etc).
The system is
  PII 300MHz
  256Mb RAM
  Latest OSS sound drivers
  ASUS Motherboard
  Wearness CD-820 CD-ROM (ATAPI)
I can read data discs using the CD and I can play sound files already
on the system (e.g. Wav and Midi files). The CD-ROM plays audio from
Windows. 
With the kernel 2.2.10, this problem does not occur (compiled out of
the box, with no patches). It does occur with kernels 2.2.13 and
2.2.14. I have compiled megalithic kernels, sparse kernels, looked for
patches etc. without any joy. I did notice that the CD-ROM drivers had
been updated between 2.2.10 and 2.2.13.  The CD-ROM I have (the
Wearness 820) is an old one (about 4 years old).
Is this a bug or have done something really dumb and stupid (it
wouldn't be the first time)?
Thanks,
Adrian
