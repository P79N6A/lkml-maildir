The very nice O_NONE idea would sort this out.  O_NONE means you can
always open the file object, but you can't do much with it.  For a
device, the device wouldn't get opened, but fstat() would return the
same device information as stat() returns.
Things like fchmod _are_ permitted though.
We could say that fs-specific ioctls (or fcntls if it goes that way) are
permitted on O_NONE file handles.
