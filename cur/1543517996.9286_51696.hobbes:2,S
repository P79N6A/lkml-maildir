I had a few random thoughts on the subject, probably unworkable..
 - If binaries were signed with public key crypto, the kernel could
   keep a list of authorized keys. To run your own code, sign it
   yourself (preferably on a "secure" airgapped machine ...)
   The procesing overhead to check keys might be crippling, though,
   if done at every invocation.
 - A MD5 daemon could be made part of a watchdog daemon. If it is killed,
   the machine reboots (and hopefully comes up firewalled until
   integrity verified). Still have to figure out how to stop said
   daemon being killed and replaced with a double before the 
   watchdog has a chance to trip.
 - Critical code could be randomized by re-ordering instructions
   and inserting NOPs (like, I think, polymorphic viruses). Then
   targeting a running binary becomes a bit more tricky than
   just building the same version and mapping the data structures.
 Douglas Kilpatrick mentioned LOMAC - I had a quick look.
 Seems LOMAC uses a tainting-type model where data from an untrusted NIC
 can taint a process causing it to be demoted to a lower access level.
 Not sure how to use this and allow remote maintenence by root.
 Also no protection of objects from objects at the same level, e.g.
 one CGI script from another.
 LOMAC documentation refers to a number of other projects, listed below

Seems other people are working on this if only I'd known where 
to look. I guess if malware gets to be a serious problem some of 
these solutions will suddenly become mainstream.
