Greetings,
Here is my basic sound setup in 2.0.36:
[ESS1688 in a Intel P133]
#
# Sound
#
CONFIG_SOUND=y
[variables not shown are not set!]
CONFIG_SB=y
CONFIG_AUDIO=y
CONFIG_MIDI=y
CONFIG_YM3812=y
SBC_BASE=220
SBC_IRQ=5
SBC_DMA=1
SB_DMA2=5
SB_MPU_BASE=0
SB_MPU_IRQ=-1
DSP_BUFFSIZE=65536
#
Am I correct to understand that the current default given
by the 2.2.0pre9 kernel config (menuconfig) assigns a value
of 330 to SB_MPU_BASE?  Also, has DSP_BUFFSIZE= been removed
from the non-2.0.* kernels?
I get a DMA output error when trying to play a sound file
with the pre9 , I will try again substituting 0 for 330 in
the MPU_BASE as that is the only real obvious difference I
can tell. Any leads helpful ... obvious first post here :-(
Thanks,
<NOVICE>
Jeff.
