I am running a MIPS machine and hit the following BUG() in
kernel/sched.c:650:
        prepare_to_switch();
        {
                struct mm_struct *mm = next->mm;
                struct mm_struct *oldmm = prev->active_mm;
                if (!mm) {
                        if (next->active_mm) BUG();           <======
                        next->active_mm = oldmm;
                        atomic_inc(&oldmm->mm_count);
                        enter_lazy_tlb(oldmm, next, this_cpu);
                } else {
                        if (next->active_mm != mm) BUG();
                        switch_mm(oldmm, mm, next, this_cpu);
                }
The "next" processor is swapper.
I have not looked at it hard enough, but an initial investigation seems
to reveal the cause trivially.  
In include/linux/sched.h, the "swapper" task is set such that 'mm' is
NULL and 'active_mm' is &init_mm.  So obviously when we switch back to
"swapper" task, we will hit the BUG().  
That sounds little too obvious to be true.  What am I missing here? 
Thanks in advance.  Please cc your reply to this email account.  I
appreciate that.
