There has been progress.  If you start with the latest 2.6.7 kernels 
(vanilla or -mm) and apply these two patches:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=108810394203966&q=raw
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=108810535225278&q=raw
the deadlock problems should be solved.  Although those patches haven't 
yet been merged, I'm pretty sure they will be.
To answer your other question...  The serialize semaphore (not spinlock) 
prevents the system from trying to do several incompatible things to a USB 
device at the same time.  For example, reset the device while a driver is 
probing it.  Or reset it while it is being suspended.
