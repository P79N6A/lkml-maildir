I personally have the feeling that 2.2.x performed better than 2.4.x
does, but I cannot go figure because I'm using ReiserFS 3.6 file
systems. I'd also really like to give Linux 2.5.39 or whatever is
current a whirl, but I'm currently using LVM and I'd need anything to
read that. Which one (EVMS or LVM2) is an ignorant-proof install and
reliable enough to read old LVM1 partitions and volumes?
