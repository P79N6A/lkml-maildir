This change looks bogus to me.  Before I get to the content, there is a nit
that annoys me.  You changed the punctuation in my comment so that it no
longer means what it did, and now the comment is nonsensical.  I don't
demand decent English from hackers of any linguistic bent, but please don't
louse up the coherent sentences I wrote when moving them down ten lines.
Please elaborate on the rationale that justifies this change.
I don't see it at all.
If you are already on the signal stack, it doesn't matter whether the
signal that just arrived has SA_ONSTACK set or not.  If you are going to
overflow the stack with the new signal frame, we want to prevent that
clobberation regardless.
Thanks,
Roland
