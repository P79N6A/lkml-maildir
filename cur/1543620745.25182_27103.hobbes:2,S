Sorry, I meant to type rvmalloc().
Many drivers (eg. USB webcam drivers), don't need virt_to_bus(). They 
only need a way to allocate reserved pages that they can safely do 
remap_page_range() on, for mmap().

Thanks, that's exactly what I was looking for. pci_vmalloc_to_page() 
should satisfy all of the USB drivers, if they override 
vma->vm_ops->nopage().
