Subject: [UPDATE REPORT] Ext3 File System "Too many files" with snort
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I applied both the ext3 htree patches and a system using Reiser FS with snort 
running with 30,000+ (actually as high s 70,000+) addresses being generated 
from one of the systems with snort 2.1.3.  I am not able to get the second system out until next week since the customer has to put in a change order, so I tested with a system at only one of the customer sites with ext3 and reiser in very contained manner,  Both the Native Reiser FS and ext3 with the patch seem to work fine on this system with an updated kernel and by creating an isolated ext3 partition and ReiserFS partition on the system.  Thanks for the help to Hans and Andreas.    
Looks fixed.
