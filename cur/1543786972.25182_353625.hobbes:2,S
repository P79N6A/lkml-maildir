Agreed, and swsusp3 provides graphical progress bar, esc-to-escape,
and "are you sure you want to crash your machine" dialogs :-).

Well, its a bit complicated. I have 3 related trees on kernel.org:
linux-good -- that are basically patches I either already sent
upstream or that I plan to send very soon. Unfortunately I did not yet
have time to apply all your stuff that you sent me for akpm; I'll need
to pull them from -mm and apply here.
linux -- that is my working tree. It contains some stuff you
probably do not want (like special keymap).
linux-sw3 -- and that's a tree to test suspending from userland, aka
swsusp3 (aka uswsusp). Currently stuck at 2.6.13 ("first make it work,
then port it to HEAD"), and it seems to work (but you should really
know what you are doing, and use ext2). usr/swsusp.c is the userland
program to do suspending.
