I think you'll find these links informative :

- read the section entitled "What's going on with the kernel headers ?"
http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0007.3/0587.html
- that's Linus' own explanation of the header issue.
http://groups-beta.google.com/group/linux.kernel/msg/9c467432e123860a?q=kernel
+headers+user+space+group:linux.kernel&rnum=2
- a bit more from Linus
