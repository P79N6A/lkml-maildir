What does `ls /proc/757' say?  Presumably no such file or directory?
It's fairly bizare behaviour to be able to open files which don't exist
according to readdir, which is why we made that change.
The node to tid 757 should appear under its thread group leader's
directory: /proc/NNN/757.  That node should be visible to readdir, and that
is the node which gdb and perfmon should be looking for.
Of course, we may have burnt our boats with the initial silliness.  It's a
shame that gdb and perfmon went and used it.
