probably principle of least privilege; the location on physical media
for a file is clearly something internal to the OS, and non-trusted
users normally don't have any business knowing that. 
I can't think of any immediate exploitable thing with it, but I'm sure
attackers would find a way to use it to increase their privilege once
they can do something like "write 512 bytes to a disk address of my
choice".. (but then again it's game over mostly already)
