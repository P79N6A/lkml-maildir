No Andi is right - he didn't agree. He made it clear he didn't agree and
even at the kernel summit from what he said I'd assumed this meant from
2.6.24 we'd simply have a different maintainer team for x86-32/64.
We all (except Andi) agreed it was going to be merged and Andi made his
position clear - Thomas and Ingo just need to update the MAINTAINERS file
and get on with it.
