Hello,
since 2.4.22-pre3-ac1 the kernel is much better (last tested is
2.4.21-ac4) regarding high load, in fact it's almost perfect ;-)
With this kernel I can convert a VDR recording to a DVD and
simultaneously reccord two movies in VDR withtout any framedrops!!!
I don't know who I should thank for this BIG chnage, but an hudge thank!
	Grégoire
