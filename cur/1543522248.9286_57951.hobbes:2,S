Hi!
Sorry to annoy you all, but I would like a quick suggestion about a
problem I have submitting a bug report about my UDMA66 card to either
linux-kernel or Andre Hedrick.
I have sent the attached bug report (email) twice to Andre, and once to
the linux-kernel, and I am afraid that it never reached the destination:
I read linux-kernel every day, and my message did not appear, and I sent 
an 'if-you-ignore-my-message-pls-blind-reply' to Andre, and nothing so
far.
My box is not in the ORBS database, so I do not know what on earth (inet;)
could be the problem.
The bug is described in the attach.
Thx 4 your kind help,

Hi@
Here is a bug report for IDE extended twice, with updates.
I forward it here, because I thought I sent it to Andre, but now I think,
maybe I can better reach him here.

Even worse: with your 0111 patch it frrezes hard without a printed error,
just at the beggining fscking the volumes not unmounted clean. Currently I
have hdparm -d0 for all drives at the beginning of sysinit, so I can only
operate w/o dma, so the server function is onoperational.
Can you help w/ advices/some patch?

Thanks in advance.
