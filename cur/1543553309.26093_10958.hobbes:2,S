Subject: 2.2.18pre18: many calls to kwhich

I noticed that kwhich is called a lot:
make oldconfig:        10
make dep:              65
make bzImage modules: 142
Assuming that this is unintentional, this patch helps a lot.

(If it gets wrapped, it's just "=" -> ":=").
It's also interesting that make dep calls kwhich an odd number
of times including one case where it looked for "gcc." I suspect
a makefile isn't playing nice but I haven't looked for it.
