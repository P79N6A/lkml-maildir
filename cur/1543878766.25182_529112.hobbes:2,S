It's just the new world that we live in.
I don't see us ever going back to 100% static major/minors.
Though as a point of history, Linux has /always/ supported dynamic 
major/minor numbers, even back in 0.99 days.  We avoided the problem 
then because the dynamic major/minors were only used by drivers that had 
not yet had static numbers assigned, or their author chose to avoid 
LANANA for some other reason.
