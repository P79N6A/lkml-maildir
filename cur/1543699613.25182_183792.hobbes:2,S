Sure.  Although depending how you do it, step 3 might be different (reuse 
the old address vs. assign a new address).  Also the failure paths will be 
different.  But that could all be handled with proper refactoring.
I intended to share common code as much as possible.  Since you've already 
got part of that (almost) written, I'll be happy to use your work.

Agreed.

Your choice makes error handling easier.  And failure to restore an 
altsetting is a pathological case anyhow, so it's not worth worrying 
about.
