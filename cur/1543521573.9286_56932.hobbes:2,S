Hello all,
Having looked into this slab cache/module problem some more (I read the
comments that a slab cache should NOT be destroyed at all), it still
leaves the problem of how to get at the existing cache after a module is
unloaded and reloaded, if it doesn't keep any memory pointer in-kernel.
Having "static cache_p" in the module is no good if the module itself
is unloaded, and patching the kernel for this filesystem module just to
hold a static pointer is not desirable.
Since we are not allowed to destroy a slab cache (I'm working with 2.3.34,
but don't see any changes to this area in 35-38), we need to then
copy the slab name into the kmem_cache_struct rather than just
having a reference, or unloading the module will cause the OOPS below.
I'm looking at mm/slab.c:kmem_cache_create(), and it does a check if the
"name" of the slab cache already exists, but it doesn't appear to do anything
about it - the result of the search isn't even used, except to print out a
message.  This should probably be done at the start of the function and
return the existing cache pointer of the same name.
Alternately, there could be a
kmem_cache_t *kmem_cache_find(char *name)
kind of function to return a pointer to an existing slab cache if it
already exists.
A patch to implement this will follow shortly...
Cheers, Andreas
