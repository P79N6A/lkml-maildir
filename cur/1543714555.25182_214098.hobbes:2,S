Please do, I never saw it before.
Though I have to admit I'm sceptical: prio_tree appears to be well
designed for the issue in question, list-of-lists sounds, well,
no offence, but a bit of a hack.
But we may well have overlooked the overhead of prio_tree's
complexity relative to list, and need to reconsider options.
