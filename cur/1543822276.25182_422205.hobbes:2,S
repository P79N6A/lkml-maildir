Andy, this all looks pretty good.  Although, it might be nice to
document this a bit more. 
First, can you update the mem_section definition comment?  It has a nice
explanation of how we use section_mem_map, and it would be a shame to
miss this use.
Also, your comment says when we _record_ the nid information, but not
that it is only _used_ during early boot.  I think this is what Mike K.
missed, and it might be good to clarify.
How about something like this:
/*
 * During early boot, before section_mem_map is used for an actual
 * mem_map, we use section_mem_map to store the section's NUMA
 * node.  This keeps us from having to use another data structure.  The
 * node information is cleared just before we store the real mem_map.
