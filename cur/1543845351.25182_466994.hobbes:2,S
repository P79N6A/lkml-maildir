In this case, would a patch ripping off asus_acpi, ibm_acpi and
toshiba_acpi  from the kernel be accepted ?
I don't really care much about sony_acpi (since I'm not maintaining it
anymore, even if I still answer support requests about it), but this is
just silly. This has been going on for more than one and a half year now.
Meanwhile (at least from what I've seen), the ACPI subsystem still doesn't
provide this "generic" API which platform specific driver need to
implement. drivers/acpi/{hotkey.c,video.c} are just rudimentary, and there
is no indication that this is going forward:

How long is this going to take ?
