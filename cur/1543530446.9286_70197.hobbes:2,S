Richard decided that's how devfs will work (r-x on symlinks).  Normally
symlinks are always rwx, but Richard made the decision "to break
programs that oughtn't depend on this" as far as I can tell.

Are you sure?  As I understand symlinks, the permissions of the symlink
don't matter.

Ah, the old "controlling terminal" problem...  Xemacs can't find a pty,
so it resorts to using a pipe to communicate with gpg.  gpg opens
/dev/tty and you get the original terminal.  Ick, ick.
