I would be very careful with this. Windows does something like this
by default and one application that I know needs twice as much swap+memory
on Windows than on Linux because of this. Since it uses a lot of memory
it would be a bad regression.
When you add it there should be at least some easy way for an application
to turn it off (madvise and probably sysctl?) and make the heuristic very 
conservative.
