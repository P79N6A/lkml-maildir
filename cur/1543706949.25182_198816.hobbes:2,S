The only reason, I guess, is that it depends on this very small
dm-daemon thing:
http://people.sistina.com/~thornber/dm/patches/2.6-unstable/2.6.2/2.6.2-udm1/00016.patch
Some other dm targets in the unstable tree use this too, it's just to
have very simple bottom-half processing in a separate thread with
synchronous start and stop functions.
Especially since dm-crypt was announced in a german linux magazine two
weeks ago people keep asking me when to expect it in the kernel. And to
delay it for some months just because there might be changes to
dm-daemon, which would be almost trivial, is a stupid reason to hold it
back if you ask me. :(
