Moreover, it's fairly easy to test stuff that's all in one place, in a
consistent format, with a simple linear stack of patches to sort through 
to find culprits.
Plus you have a great tendency of dropping stuff like a stone when it's
broken, which helps a lot. Having some basic pre-mainline-merge testing
keeps the quality of mainline way up.
It'd help more if people focused more on testing their own shit before
submitting it than complaining about -mm. If it's the same people breaking 
the tree all the time, I'm sure we can find a recycled set of stocks 
somewhere.
