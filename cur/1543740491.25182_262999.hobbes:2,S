With all the video chips I've worked with the mfg gives me a binary 
formatted up as an option ROM and I'm responsible for getting it called.

What I've seen is that they simply place a copy of the video bios at the 
shadowed legacy vbios range usually 0xc0000 but it can be anywhere in 
the 0xc0000-0x0e0000 range.  Or physically locate the vbios in the 
onboard ROM such that it will show up in that range.
Then when the system bios goes through its scan of the legacy ranges 
looking for option roms it hits the video bios and runs it.
