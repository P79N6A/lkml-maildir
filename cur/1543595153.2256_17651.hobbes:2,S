Both seem to have pros and cons. RPC should be easier to write (especialy the
server side), but it performs bad with UDP on slow links. (NFS did not work on
115200 serial line because of too many dropped packets - TCP flow control too
badly needed in such cases). Or can linux do RPC over TCP?
For puropose of shool excercise the work saved with RPC might be tha main argument.
