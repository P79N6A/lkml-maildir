   that has nothing to do with kernel. If you are running display 0 and 
start another X (without specifying display, it default to 0) it doesn't 
work since there cannot be two servers on same machine both being 0. You 
can start another X server with different number (e.g. startx -- :1 or 
whatever number is not used yet).
