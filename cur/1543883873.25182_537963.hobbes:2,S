Well then, send me a patch that dumps that information out just before it locks up.
We know (first post in this thread) that the lockup occurs just after
these two messages:
  "switched to high resolution mode on cpu 1"
  "switched to high resolution mode on cpu 0"
So just dump out anything else you need to see at the same time,
and it'll still be on my screen when the darned thing locks up.
Simple, eh.  We both get to run around a treadmill this way.  ;)
