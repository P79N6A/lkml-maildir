   possible microoptimizations, but I challenge you to *measure* the
   slowdown between:
Regardless, his space arguments still hold.
I don't like having everyone eat the overhead that hotplugging cpus

And remember, it's the anal "every microoptimization at all costs"
people that keep the kernel sane and from running out of control bloat
