ftrace has a very limited glob feature, and requires no recursion.
Basically, we allow:
*match
match*
*match*
We do not allow match*two, that would be the same as match*
I need to look at your code (I would like a generalized glob feature for
user input). Can you accomplish the same with using a loop instead of
recursion?
