I don't think that's a big problem?  This syscall can (oddly) return any
32-bit (64-bit) number and a smart application developer (after saying wtf)
would realise that he just can't check for errors and have correctly
working code.
Then again, if he was smart he just wouldn't use times(2)'s return value
for anything.  But what is the alternative?  I don't think there is one,
apart from much saner things like gettimeofday().
