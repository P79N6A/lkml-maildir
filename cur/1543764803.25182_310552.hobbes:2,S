Btw, does anybody have strong opinions on the license? I didn't put in a 
COPYING file exactly because I was torn between GPLv2 and OSL2.1.
I'm inclined to go with GPLv2 just because it's the most common one, but I 
was wondering if anybody really had strong opinions. For example, I'd 
really make it "v2 by default" like the kernel, since I'm sure v3 will be 
fine, but regardless of how sure I am, I'm _not_ a gambling man.
