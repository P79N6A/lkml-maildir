Hi folks,
I got troubles with kernel panics shown below since 2.6.8
Distribution: Gentoo Linux 2005.0
Hardware Environment: Asus CUR-DLS Dual P3 / Serverworks Chip + Highpoint 372
softraid crap controller
Software Environment: 2.6.11, actual gentoo ~x86 tree
Problem Description: since 2.6.8 I get Kernel Panics in module hpt372 wich is
included in hpt366 driver
Steps to reproduce:
Since I use that controller due to unstabilities just as normal ide controller I
got no more trouble. But 2.6.7 was the las kernel that was able to bring hpt372
up. I dont need to boot from that device but my storage HDDs are on its line.
What I can see from the error is this, although there is quite more above that.
Screen begins with:
Process swapper (pid: 1, threadinfo=dffc1000 task=dffc0a40)
Stack: c0311375... <many more 8bit columns>
Call Trace: [<c0311375>] hpt372_tune_chipset+0xd5/0x160
next in call trace are more ide and htp related things connected to the stack
numbers
Code: ff 85 c0 ba... and more of 2 bit code
<0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
and thats the point where I have to go with the reset button and be happy my
2.6.7 still exists :/
There were added three patches to the sources described in here:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.8
just search the changelog for "hpt" and you'll find.
is it possible to undo that patches? at least one of them has to cause the errors...
I tried the Highpoint Own linux sources but when i modprobe them there is write errors
and it takes more than 5 minutes to load the first hdd in line and by the second one
the driver gives up trying.
thanks for reading
