Hi Nick,

hmm, using this in 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 my machine starts to swap very very soon. 
Machine has squid, bind, apache running, X 4.3.0, Windowmaker, so nothing 
special.
Swap grows very easily starting to untar'gunzip a kernel tree. About + 
150-200MB goes to swap. Everything is very smooth though, but I just wondered 
because w/o your patches swap isn't used at all, even after some days of 
uptime.
ciao, Marc
