Hmm.  It looks like something is up wrong with lilo.  If you don't get
as far as the Uncompressing line, you haven't even gotten to the linux
kernel.  It may be something in the 16 bit setup code that queries
the BIOS but that is unlikely.
Hmm.  Actually more likely which kernel have you pointed lilo to?
arch/i386/boot/bzImage?
