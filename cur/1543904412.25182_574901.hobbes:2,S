you need to measure it over longer periods of time. Its not worth 
balancing for such a thing in any high-frequency manner. (we'd trash the 
cache constantly migrating tasks back and forth.)

the runtime ranges from 1:38.66 to 1:46.38 - that's a +-3% spread which 
is pretty acceptable for ~90 seconds of runtime. Note that the 
percentages you see above were likely done over a shorter period that's 
why you see them range from 61% to 91%.

the 3s is the problem: change that to 60s! We no way want to 
over-migrate for SMP fairness, the change i did gives us reasonable 
long-term SMP fairness without the need for high-rate rebalancing.
