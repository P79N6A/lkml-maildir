The following machine is a dual pentium iii 500,  3com 905b 10/100 card,
IBM scsi drives 2x18 1x9, supermicro p6dgu motherboard, 256 megs ECC ram.
It runs kernel nfs that is pretty loaded down network wise
(15-40mbit/sec).
I have noticed an abnormal ammount of the following errors:
Jan 10 14:12:15 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
Jan 10 15:33:14 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
Jan 11 14:55:09 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
Jan 11 21:30:22 corn kernel: svc: bad direction 1, dropping request 
Jan 12 14:26:34 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
Jan 12 14:41:59 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
Jan 12 15:19:32 corn kernel: find_fh_dentry: 08:05/505942 dir/1333249 not
found! 
Jan 12 15:22:48 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
Jan 12 15:23:53 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
Jan 12 18:28:22 corn kernel: eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status
e000. 
(these errors were much fewer with kernel 2.2.13)
I am also unable to copy 15gigs of data from a similarly configured
machine that mounts the above over a LAN because the machine that mounts
"corn" locks up after about a gigabyte of transfer- no ping response.
The machines are connected via a 3com 10/100 switch.
Is anybody else having NFS / network problems on loaded down SMP systems?
Thanks for a great OS!
