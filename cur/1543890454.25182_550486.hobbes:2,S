Changes in floppy.c from 2.6.17 and 2.6.18 have broken an application I have. I have tracked 
it down to a single line of code. When the following patch is applied to the version in 2.6.18
my application works.

I don't claim to understand the changes from 2.6.17 to 2.6.18 except for the devfs removal.
All I can say is this one line of code kills the application. I have tried to write a short pgm
that shows my problem but everything else I write seems to work. The application only runs
on SMP machines and uses process and irq affinities with real-time scheduling. When I turn
off process and irq affinities the application runs. 
I have tried kernels up through 2.6.21.1 with the same results. All kernels from 2.6.18 up
require that I remove this one line of code or my application does not work?

Mark
