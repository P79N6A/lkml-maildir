Not so... the correct way is
           L     R2,newvalue  New value to register
           L     R1,word      Current value to register
LOOP CS    R1,R2,word   Store new value if word is unchanged
          BNE   loop         It changed, retry with new current value
When the comparison of R1 versus word fails, the new value of word is
swapped into R1 automically. There is also a CDS compare double and
swap, useful for updating doubleword (eight byte, aligned)
automically.
The avoids one load and prevents a race condition if word is changing
rapidly.
