That's incorrect. gcc-3_3-branch is stable branch, the difference between
3.3 and 3.3.1-pre is mostly bugfixes. Of course, some new things appear
on the branch from time to time, but it is very different from GCC trunk
where development occurs.
gcc-3_2-branch does not introduce any new stuff, since similarly
to gcc-2_95-branch is dead (only gcc-3_2-rhl8-branch is maintained still).
