	If they use cut-through switching, they do. Some use adaptive switching,
which means they use cut-through switching but change to store and forward
if there are too many runts, jabber frames, bad CRCs, and so on.
	Obviously, you can't always do a cut-through. If the target port is busy,
cut-through is impossible. If the ports are different speeds, cut-through is
impossible. The Intel 510T switch for my home network does adaptive
switching with configurable error thresholds. In fact, it's even smarter
than that, with an intermediate mode that suppresses runts without doing a
full store and forward. See:

	Except not all switches always avoid propogating bad frames.
