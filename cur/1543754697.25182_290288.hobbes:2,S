Context for LKML and discuss@x86-64; grub segfaults when running its
'install' command (via grub-install) on Debian and Ubuntu systems
running stock kernels >= 2.6.9-bk2, up to and including 2.6.11-rc2-bk3
(haven't tried 2.6.11-rc2-bk4 yet). grub is a 32-bit binary relying on
ia32 emulation. The implementation of the 'install' command in grub uses
nested functions, which require a stack trampoline, and therefore the
executable-stack bit is set on the binary:
  $ readelf -l /sbin/grub | grep STACK
  STACK          0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RWE 0x4
However, booting with noexec=off cures the problem, so it would appear
that the executable stack bit isn't being checked properly at least
under ia32 emulation.
2.6.9-bk1 works fine, but noexec=on only became the default in
2.6.9-bk2; I haven't yet tried booting 2.6.9-bk1 with noexec=on, but I
can try that if it might be helpful.
Thanks,
