 Well, the test looks reasonable if the system load is low.  Still the
performance is surprisingly low -- after changing the transfer width to 16
bits I ran the test on my dual P5MMX system equipped with an old ISA VGA
card and I achieved 10.74ms for VGA RAM accesses and 586.6us for uncached
main memory accesses.

 For VIA -- definitely.  I don't think Matrox is at fault, though.

 At least ServerWorks claims they are willing to cooperate with us
although results seem to be questionable so far...
