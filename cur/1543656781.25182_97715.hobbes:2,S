Could you split up the new revisions into a series of reviewable
patches with clearly-defined individual scope and descriptive changelog
entries and post them (in your mail message, not as URL's) please? I
actually use this driver at home, so I'd like to be able to understand
what's going on with it. I suspect various others are of like mind.
Thanks,
Bill
