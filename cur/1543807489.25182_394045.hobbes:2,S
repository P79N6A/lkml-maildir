Hi,
Trying to recover from a disk failure [1], we:
- installed a fresh ubuntu 5.10 (modified kernel 2.6.12) on a new disk
- stopped machine
- connected failing SATA disk to board (in order to try to recover some data)
- rebooted
That doesn't work at all:
* Setting up LVM Volumne Groups
* Starting Enterprise Volume Management System...

Buffer I/O error on device dm-3, logical block 1

ata4: translated ATA stat/err 0x25/00 to SCSI SK/ASC
Buffer I/O error on device dm-3, logical block 6
....
And the boot doesn't go further, the error messages keep looping from
block 0 to 12.
As I am trying to minimize my number of reboots (to not stress my
failing disk), maybe someone has an idea what those messages could
mean? Is that due to my failing disk? Is it some sort of SATA
configuration issue? Or is there an EVMS issue?
Otherwise I will prevent the EVMS daemon from starting at boot and see
if that fixes my issue.
Cheers,
Jerome
