I'll try to narrow it down somewhat. Unfortunately, the nature of binary
search is so that even if I manage to declare half of the patches as
irrelevant, that doesn't help much.

Oh happiness. :-/  At least part of the bug (galeon misplaces text) still
exists, as it turns out, though it's a lot harder to trigger with
2.6.0-mm1. Since the galeon thing was usually the first Special Effect to
show up, this may well be two different bugs -- and I'm not ruling out an
application problem.
