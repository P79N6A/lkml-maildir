With kernel version 2.3.15-pre2 printing is broken. After inserting the
parport, parport_pc, and lp modules, and file sent to /dev/lp0 silently
disappears. The recognition data is:
Aug 21 14:50:08 Dragon kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7
	[PCSPP,TRISTATE]
Aug 21 14:50:08 Dragon kernel: lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
Has anyone else seen this behavior? Under 2.3.13, attempting to send data
to /dev/lp0 resulted in a full system freeze.
