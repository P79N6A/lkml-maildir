Hello all!
Thanks for the many answers, it was a process stuck at D state, I didn't
think D processes do count into load avg.
Anyway it happened to us several times that the printer filter (ljet-** o
similar) stucks at D process. I cannot kill this, but I kill its parent
lpd and then it disappears. Is this okay?
Thanks
