Ok, now I find myself without any other arguments :-) shm_unlink() right 
after shm_open() is a solution.

I wrote the above not knowing that I could use shm_unlink() right after 
shm_open(). But still, I have lost a considerable amount of time trying 
to figure that out.
It appeared all natural to me that I could just remap ANONYMOUS and get 
what I wanted. And the worst thing here is that the man pages do not let 
you know about that.
