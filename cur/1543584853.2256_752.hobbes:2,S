(re cc'd to lkml...)
My fault on that one, I didn't send it to lkml...
BTW if you noticed, this problem was undetected initially due to
differences between CONFIG_ISAPNP and CONFIG_ISAPNP_MODULE in the
source.
It is highly recommended to always compile with CONFIG_ISAPNP=y due to
these differences.  If you grep around for CONFIG_ISAPNP versus
CONFIG_ISAPNP_MODULE, you'll see that many drivers are woefully
unprepared for isapnp support compiled as a module.
