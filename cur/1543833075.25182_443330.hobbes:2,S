Quoting Dave Jones from a few mails down the thread:
It did make a noticable difference to compiles, though I forget the
exact numbers.   Should be in the list archives somewhere.
I have vague recollection that it shaved off around 20-30s, though

#2 was not about include order, but about things like CONFIG_SMP,
different arches, etc.  As Russell King showed, breaking Arm is easier
