as discussed in a previous thread, if you use select(), you should also
use non-blocking sockets. There are cases where select() can wake you up
without anything to read, eg if there is a packet waiting with a wrong
checksum.

I too came across this problem a long time ago and concluded that LOWAT
was not really usable on Linux. But in the end, this is not really a big
deal, because as long as your application doesn't eat all CPU, it does
not change anything performance-wise, and when it becomes to eat a lot
of CPU, the latency will increase, letting more data come in when you
do one read.

Yes.
