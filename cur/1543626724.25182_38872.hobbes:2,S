	The GPL permits you to modify and use GPL'd code however you wish provided
you don't distribute it. The GPL permits you to modify, use, and distribute
GPL'd code however you like provided you make the source available.

	You are not thinking in principles. A GPL'd package with a digital rights
management scheme you are prohibited from modifying is an abomination to the
principles the GPL was supposed to stand for. This is not free as in
freedom.
	If the free software people will sacrifice freedom in exchange for coerced
openness, then someone else will have to stand for freedom.
