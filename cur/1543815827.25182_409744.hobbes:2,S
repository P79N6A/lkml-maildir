Subject: [PATCH 11/34] mm: page-replace-should_reclaim_mapped.patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/22/426

From: Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl>
Move the reclaim_mapped code over to its own function so that other
reclaim policies can make use of it.
