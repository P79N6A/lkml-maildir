Well, idea of filtering tool having flexibility to create its own ELF note
and later retrieve it and use it looks good. But at the same time you 
will have to standardize the contents of ELF note. One can not keep on
changing it at will.

Providing first kernel's debug data on commandline while loading second
kernel is little odd but I guess can be lived with.

Overall proposal looks interesting. But it still requires a debug compiled
vmlinux for one to use filtering. For distros it is probably easy as they
can extract the debug info at build time and ship separate file with kernel
package (/boot/mkdfinfo-2.6.xxx). For people building their custom kernel,
they still need to build vmlinux with debuginfo. Personally, I wished
we could get rid of this requirement. I think may be down the line we can
start exporting it from kenrel once contents of ELF note are well defined.
