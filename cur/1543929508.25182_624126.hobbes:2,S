10GbE can't do 14M packets per second if the packets are 1514 bytes.  At
10M packets per second you have less than 1000 bits per packet, which is
far from 1514bytes.
10Gbps gives you at most 1.25GBps, which at 1514 bytes per packet works
out to 825627 packets per second.  You could reach ~14M packets per
second with only the smallest packet size, which is rather unusual for
high throughput traffic, since you waste almost all the bytes on
overhead in that case.  But you do want to be able to handle at least a
million or two packets per second to do 10GbE.
