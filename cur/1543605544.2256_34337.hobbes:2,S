One of the engineers here has also seen this.  The root cause is that
readdir() is returning a file multiple times.  We've seen it on tmpfs.
We also have seen in in NFS and had a workaround, the workaround
depended that the file would be returned twice right next to each other
and that's not the case in tmpfs.  wscott@bitmover.com can provide you
with the details of his machine config, here's the mail he sent a while
back about it:
