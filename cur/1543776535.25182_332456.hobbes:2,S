Hi everybody
It's Rachel here from SKS and we are sorting out our mailing lists finally. Seven years of disarray. Yikes. As it's not our intention to be sending any spam to anyone, please do us the favour of responding to this mail with the word 'Subscribe' in the subject line to remain on the list.
This way we can be sure our list is finally cleaned up and you can continue to receive updates on H Pisces, Living Jane, Bowlox and more!
Thanks and God Bless
Rachel @ SKS Music
