The warning above is caused by the configuration of the device below. I found
and fixed this problem several months ago, but after the 2.6.24 window closed.

The problem is fixed in the wireless-testing.git tree, and in mainline 
2.6.25. It is unlikely that it is causing the boot problem; however that 
could be checked by trying 2.6.25.
