Ok, this afternoon I was definitly running a kernel with that patch in it,
and managed to get a trace (It was the one from the top of this thread
that unfortunatly got truncated).
Now, I can't reproduce it on a plain 2.6.18+that patch.
I'll leave the stress test running overnight, and see if anything
falls out in the morning.
