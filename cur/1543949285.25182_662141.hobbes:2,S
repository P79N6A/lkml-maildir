Hello.
According to Documentation/SubmitChecklist,
ppc64 is a good architecture for cross-compilation checking.
I've just set up cross compiling environment for ppc64
using "crossdev -t ppc64" on Gentoo 2007.0 environment.
Now I'm trying to modify Makefile to build kernel for ppc64.
I've got a question here.
  ARCH            ?= powerpc
  CROSS_COMPILE   ?= powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu-
Which keyword ("ppc" or "powerpc") do I need to set for ARCH
to do cross-compilation checking?
How do they differ?
Regards.
