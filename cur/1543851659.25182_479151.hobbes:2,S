The patch applies cleanly , compiles and runs smoothly against 2.6.18.1.
I'm running slackware-current with a 2.6.18.1 kernel on an ext3
filesystem.
Background why I use the patch:
With 2.6.18 to create a tuntap interface CAP_NET_ADMIN is required.
Qemu uses tuntap to create a tap interface as a virtual net interface.
Instead now running qemu with root privileges to give it the right
to create a tap interface, i granted qemu with the help of the patch and
Kaigai Kohei's userspace tools the cap-net_admin capability. So qemu
runs again without root privilege but has now the right to create the
tap interface.
Thanks for the patch. It reduces my the need of suid-bit progs.
It should be given a spin in -mm.
I will document my experiences on
