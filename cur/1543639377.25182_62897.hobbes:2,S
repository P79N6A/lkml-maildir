For some reason, the put_device() is forcing the refcount to 0, which 
shouldn't be happening. The refcounting model for devices is pretty wack 
right now, and this is one of a few places that's hitting it..
To solve this issue, I really think that driverfs_remove_partitions can go 
away. When a device's driverfs directory, all the files in it will be 
removed, so explicitly removing them is unnecssary.
