They can do that already by abusing fsync for every byte written or some
such.
This ridiculous reading won't be suc a big deal anyway, the abusive
process will 
be blocked for IO a lot of the time letting others run, and the others
will find
their data in the now un-polluted cache.  
Of course there are ways to prevent abuse too.  The minimum limit could
be 
8 pages instead of 2 perhaps.  And the kernel don't *need* to honor such
a request,
it is a 'hint', not a 'rule'.  The kernel can ditch the hint if it
proves
ineffective.  A backwards seek outside the limit could
raise the limit so that sort of seek may be cached the next time, for
example.
