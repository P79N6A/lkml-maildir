They start off with affinity masks of 0xf on a 4-CPU system.  I would
expect them to load-balance across the four CPUs, but they stay all
on the same CPU until long after I lose patience (many minutes).
Since there are eight readers, I use the following commands:
	taskset -p 3 pid1
	taskset -p 3 pid2
	taskset -p 6 pid3
	taskset -p 6 pid4
	taskset -p c pid5
	taskset -p c pid6
	taskset -p 9 pid7
	taskset -p 9 pid8
where the "pidn" are all replaced by the pids of the torture readers.
Before I do this, the processes are all sharing a single CPU.  After I
do this, they are spread reasonably nicely over the CPUs.  I do need to
allow some migration in order to fully test the realtime RCU variants
in the various preemption scenarios.
