I was not very articulate here.  I agree that automatic text indexing 
should be done with a lag in batches for performance reasons, rather 
than in the BeFS style.  I also think that it should not be done for all 
files, that the user should have control over what he runs the indexer 
on, and what indexer he likes to run, and what settings it uses, etc.  
In particular, the user should be free to index by hand.
All that said, the indexes themselves should just be feature enhanced 
directories accessed via the kernel.  Feature enhancements might include 
such things as better space efficiency, ordering plugins, etc.
