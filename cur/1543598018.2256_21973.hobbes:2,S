By "The Other OS" I assume you mean NT.  NT does _not_ zero files on
delete, either with NTFS or anything else.  It merely unlinks them like
any other OS.  I can't think of anything that nullifies files, except
utilities meant solely to do that (often called "sweeping").
Do you have any idea how long it would take to zero files?  If you
removed even a moderately sized directory, it would take a _very long_
time.
