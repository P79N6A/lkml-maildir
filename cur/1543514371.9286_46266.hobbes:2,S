Yes, go ahead. (I no not see what MAGIC-l might be usefull for. [What
are MAGIC-i and MAGIC-e usefull for, anyway?]). Just: you want to kill
it also from that help line. You know "killalL" later in the file. BTW
you'll want to mail it either to linus (to actually kill option) or to
mj (who wrote the code).

PS: We are running short of letters with MAGIC-x; that's why I
advocate killing MAGIC-l :-).
