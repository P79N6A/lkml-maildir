I did get glibc 2.3.2 compiled with gcc 3.3 against the 2.5.70 headers 
with only 3 changes made to the glibc source.
The result on the other hand wasn't pretty.  Most programs did run fine, 
"ls" was not one of them.  It would segfault.  (Note to self: If glibc's 
"make check" fails, don't install it.)
Your first comment is something I had wondered about for a while. A 
stable set of userspace kernel headers. That would be nice.  Of course 
changes could be made to reflect new kernel interfaces.  So they should 
still be distributed with the kernel source.  Then glibc could be 
compiled against those updates, and the headers installed as the system 
default.  But it wouldn't be so forbidden for userspace to touch them.
