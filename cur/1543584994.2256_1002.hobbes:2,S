Despair no more! I've implemented a patch for util-linux-2.11a
which adds LABEL support to mkswap(8) and swapon/swapoff(8).
- I shrunk the padding field in the new-style swap_header to make
  room for 16 bytes worth of volume label (same as ext2)
- mkswap -L label also sets the volume label
- swapon -L label looks for a swap partition with the given label
  (using a clone of mount(8)'s LABEL/UUID= support code)
- swapon/swapoff -a also handles swap fstab entries where the
  device is specified as LABEL=<label>
The patch is available at
