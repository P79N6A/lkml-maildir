CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ (supported on s390 and ARM currently, but also gaining
x86 support very soon) lets timer ticks to be skipped on idle CPUs. This
has several implications on core kernel, which are addressed in
these patches sent in separate mails.
Patch 0/3	- 	This mail.
Patch 1/3	-	Fix a RCU race condition
Patch 2/3	- 	add_timer_on needs to check for wakeup of
			sleeping CPU.
Patch 3/3	- 	Take care of scheduler load imbalance because
			rebalance does not happen when idle
			CPU shuts of ticks for extended periods.
			(This is more of place holder right now for
			a real patch).
