Yes.  linux/io.h was only created recently.  It's proper style to
include linux/foo.h when both linux/foo.h and asm/foo.h exist [1]
This is just a transition which hasn't been completed yet (indeed, has
barely begun).

I really don't think that proliferating header files unnecessarily is a
good idea.
[1] Except, of course, <linux/irq.h>, but I thought rmk was going to fix
that.
