Yep, here:

For some reason, the above mail didnt make it into lkml (maybe it
exceeded the max size allowed). I also have a updated version of that
which I hope to post as soon as I am done with something else I am
working on (sigh ..)

Again this depends on whether every subsystem need to be able to support
the user-space query you pointed out.

Sorry that sentence seems to be garbled by some mail router :)
Did you mean to say "when the number of aggregators sharing the same
container object are more" ?
I agree ..Putting N pointers in container_group object just to support
queries isn't justified at this point, because we don't know whether all
subsystems need to support such queries.

Yes that would be better than having N pointers in aggregator. From
supporting purely user-space query pov, I think that is roughly same
as having a 'dentry pointer' per resource object (what I mentioned earlier). 
IMO we should add a dentry/container_subsys_state pointer only for those 
subsystems which need to support such queries ..
