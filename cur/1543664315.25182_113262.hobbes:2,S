Hello,
  I use IBM NetVista and IBM x370.  Both run on
linux-kernel-2.5.63.  The NetVista has RedHat Linux as
base installation, while the x370 has RedHat Linux
Advanced Server as base installation. With the
kernel-2.5.63, I am not able to reboot (using reboot
command) or shutdown (shutdown command).  I have to
hard-reboot the machine.  I wonder whether any one
encountered this problem with 2.5.63.  Is there a
solution to this problem?
Thanks,
Sincerely,
Ananda
