Yes, I've seen the messages since somewhere around 2.2.1

I have no problems reproducing it, I get it every time i run
cdparanoia.
The following is output from running  cdparanoia -s -v -B "1-"

And there it simply hangs, needing a kill -9 to terminate the
process. The hang is caused by cdparanoia trying to open /dev/sgb

That patch would be really nice :).

I'm currently running kernel 2.2.3-ac1 and
cdparanoia III alpha prerelease 9.4 (December 16, 1998).
This is probably a rather old version of cdparanoia, but its worked
fine for me up until a this problem occured. So i haven't felt
any need to upgrade.

If you need any other help debugging i'm willing to help.
