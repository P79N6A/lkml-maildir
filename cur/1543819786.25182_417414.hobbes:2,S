Subject: [ANNOUNCE] ISSI is porting PitBull Foundation and LX to Linux using the LSM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Innovative Security Systems is porting both our Foundation and LX
products to Linux using the LSM interface. We had intended to wait on
this announcement until the port was complete but due to the current
discussions on the LSM we felt we should make our intentions known.
We are currently working on the kernel modules required to support our
Foundation product on Linux. Our intent is to GPL the code and submit it
for inclusion into the kernel. We will also release the commands,
utilities, and libraries but at a later date.
ISSI plans to release our LX product using the LSM at a later date. We
plan to GPL the code and also submit it for inclusion into the kernel.
If anyone wants to know the details of what functionality and security
attributes will be added, please drop me a note or see our website
(below).
