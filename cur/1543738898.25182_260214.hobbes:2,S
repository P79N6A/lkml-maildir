You can use iget4() along with a filesystem-specific comparison function,
which allows you to distinguish inodes with the same number based on
some extra data (e.g. generation number, 64-bit inode numbers, etc).  Is
there a reason to recycle the inode numbers, or could you just have a
32-bit counter?

You can use the ->delete_inode method which is a hook to be called
before/instead of the clear_inode() function in iput(), and is
the last thing action taken when the inode is being unlinked.  There
is also the ->clear_inode inode method, which is called when inodes
are being put away but not only when being unlinked.
