The SCSI drivers menu has problems similar to the MTD drivers menu.
I.e., some items are displayed on the left panel of xconfig
when they should appear on the right panel.  E.g., these are all
on the left-side panel but should be on the right side:
  SCSI Transport Attributes
  SCSI low-level drivers
    Fusion MPT device support
    PCMCIA SCSI adapter support
Similar comments for the Sound menu.
Are you testing with menuconfig/xconfig/gconfig ?
