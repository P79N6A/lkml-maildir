There's a couple of problems here.  First, the serial number thing
should be done differently.  The serial number should be spcecified by
a module parameter, and just store it as u8 and do direct compare (this
will eliminate the unecessary kmalloc, and the subsequent memory leak
you introduced).  Second, the relax stuff should not be done via config
parameters.  It, of course, undermines the point of the module, but if
you want to do it, make it done via userspace writing to some exposed fs
(e.g.. echo /usr/bin/foo > ..../relax).  Finally, do the lookup there,
and then keep your whitelist as inode based, not pathname based.
