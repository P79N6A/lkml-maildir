Hardware support was not an initial goal, as the requirements are not yet 
fully known.
From Documentation/crypto/api-intro.txt:
  An asynchronous scheduling interface is in planning but not yet
  implemented, as we need to further analyze the requirements of all of
  the possible hardware scenarios (e.g. IPsec NIC offload).
Hardware accelerators are generally a known issue, with already proven 
solutions (e.g. the OpenBSD crypto queue).  We don't know much about IPSec 
NIC offload yet, however.
