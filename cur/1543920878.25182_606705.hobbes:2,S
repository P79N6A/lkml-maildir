Thanks.
Probably everything is fine.
I added a new mixer control called "Master Volume"
it is a VolumeKnob.
It is a hardware control, that was unused in the driver before.
It affects the volume of all DACs
check if it is enabled, and set to maximum value.
This control affects the volume quite a lot, for example on my system
if I set it to middle, I almost hear no sound.
Maybe something else unrelated to my patches broke your sound too.
