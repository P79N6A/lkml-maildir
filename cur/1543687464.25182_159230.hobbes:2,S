Sigh.  Well the filesystem obviously shat itself, so the fsck errors aren't
that surprising.
My guess would be that something oopsed while holding a directory semaphore
and you missed the oops.  Maybe you were in X at the time?
If it happens again, please remember that dmesg needs the `-s 1000000'
option to prevent it from truncating output.

It's pretty bad.  I'm running 2.6.0-test3-mm1 here which has Ingo/Con
goodies and it is significantly improved.
Once that code is working sufficiently well for everyone and there is
consensus that the general direction is correct and the possible
regressions with mixed database workloads are sorted out, we'll fix it up. 
So don't panic yet.
