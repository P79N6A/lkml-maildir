I really think you need to document/comment the struct members.
The newly introduced "enabled" for example, is serving a dual-purpose
in your code here (like you mention in the Changelog). It's used not
only to enable/disable a target, but also to ensure atomicity when
changing the (multiple) configurable parameters of a given target ...
the first purpose is self-evident from the name, but the second is
non-obvious. A sysfs node is also a userspace interface, so some
explicit mention of this is required.
