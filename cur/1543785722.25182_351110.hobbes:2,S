This is fixed by another way in 2.6.14-rc1 for i386 (Thanks, Roland).
The changelog line is:

And now similar fix for mips is already in Linux/MIPS CVS tree too.

I suppose the original problem on s390 (reported by Heiko Carstens)
could be fixed same way.  Then 'sigkill priority fix' would be
reverted safely.
