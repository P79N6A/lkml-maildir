What about this case where one of the relative nodes wraps around to 
represent an already set node in the result?
	relative	mems_allowed	result
	1,3,6		4-8		5,7 or 5-7 ?
Neither result is immediately obvious to me logically: either your result 
has less weight than your relative nodemask (seems like a bad thing) or 
your relative nodemask really isn't all that relative to begin with (it's 
the same result as 1-3, 6-8, 11-13, etc).
Or is this just a less-than-desired side-effect of relative nodemasks that 
we're willing to live with given its other advantages?
