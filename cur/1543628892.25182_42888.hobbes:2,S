I have no ACPI or APM enabled (mobo does not know what it is)

It happens after fsck (1.27) examined the root partition (hda1) finished and 
the bootscripts executed the next command (fsck hdc1)
with exactly the same fsck on 2.4.19-pre7 everything is fine (after repairing 
the damage done in 2.5.10-dj1)
luckily I do not have a cdrom or floppy drive attached so it was easy to 
recover :), going to create a 'rescue' partition...
BTW, I had this same problem with 2.5.9-dj1... not tried with 2.5.9 or 2.5.10.

IDE/ATA part of my .config:

# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX were set in 2.5.9-dj1 but 
that generated the same problem.
