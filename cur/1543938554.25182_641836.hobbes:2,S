thanks, applied.
btw., please send future x86 cleanup patches against x86.git#mm. For 
example, this bit:
> -struct seq_operations cpuinfo_op = {
> +const struct seq_operations cpuinfo_op = {
>  	.start =c_start,
already looks a bit different there so it didnt apply straight away. (i 
fixed that up so no need to resend)
x86.git#mm tracking coordinates are at:
