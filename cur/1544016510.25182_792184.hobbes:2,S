At least originally, the meaning of the x86 highmem entries were:
	No highmem	- No highmem, no PAE
	HIGHMEM4G	- Highmem, no PAE
	HIGHMEM64G	- Highmem, PAE
So X86_PAE and HIGHMEM4G is a bit of a contradiction.  I haven't looked 
at the logic in detail, or remember offhand if there have been any 
weakening of the definitions above; e.g. someone could have implemented 
a way to do PAE without highmem, to get access to the NX bits.
