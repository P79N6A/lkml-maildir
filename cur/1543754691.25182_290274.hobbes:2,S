Hi all,
In version 2.6.4, I observed that the "global" bit will be set if this tlb 
entry is used to map KSEG2 (kernel segment 2, starting from 0xc0000000). 
But in version 2.6.10, the "global" bit won't be set even if the tlb entry 
is used to map KSEG2.
I would like to know if it's right.
Thanks in advance.
regards,
Jacky
