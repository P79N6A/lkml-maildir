We do not lost clock ticks on ordinary desktops at HZ==1000 which is what I'm 
recommending here. For servers and laptops I'm recommending 100.

Yes I understand that but there is also the matter that we don't guarantee 
timers actually even succeed at the HZ value. In practice our timers, even at 
almost no load, only can guarantee firing 2 or 3 ticks after the time we 
requested. This means we need timers to be about 3x higher than the 250 we 
need.

Yes I stored a family of these values and 864 was ~ the optimum for a high 
value for desktops and ~84 for a low value but were unpopular for not being 
something decimally familiar. Also lots of code kind of broke with values 
below 100 in the kernel.
Thanks!
