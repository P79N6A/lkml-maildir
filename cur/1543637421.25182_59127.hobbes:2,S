For x86 we can probably do that. It would needlessly break 2.0/2.2/2.4
functionality for the sake of some trivial lock handling. Much better to
fix the problem. I'll take a look at it, when I merge all the other
needed pci config fixes from 2.4 into 2.5, and I guess start putting out
2.5-ac since Linus didnt take all my patches.
[The 2.5 CMD640 code breaks some adaptec stuff which is fixed in the 2.4
 code]
