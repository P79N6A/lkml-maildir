Hi Zwane, I just finished checking, and without highmem and with HIGHMEM4G
it works just fine, only with 64G I get the 'Unknown key pressed' flood which
I described.  I had 64G on because I copied my .config from Arjan's 2.6 RPMs,
none of which worked on this machine because of those keyboard troubles.  The
box has 1G of RAM.
Thanks!  Anything else I can try?
