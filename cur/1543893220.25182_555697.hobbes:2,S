This fds will be out of POSIX definition in any case. They have to be 
based at very high values in any case in order to be useful, and this 
already breaks the POSIX definition of them.

You seem to deny the fact that libraries cannot reliably use fds allocated 
by POSIX rules for internal communication with the kernel. I really don't 
know what to say, if not that we must have a different definition of the 
word "reliable".
Maybe if you go back in the thread and give your solutions, using POSIX 
fds allocation semantics, to the problems that have been exposed, that 
might help understanding.
