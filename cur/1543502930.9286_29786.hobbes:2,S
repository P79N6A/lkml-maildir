A little more detail has come out about Amiga's plans and Linux.
http://www.amiga.de/diary/executive/tech_brief.html
This is an interesting overview, heavy on the philosophy, but with
enough tech. detail to be interesting.
One detail that caught my eye was near the bottom, where 
they list, under "Processor Subsystem":
"Hardware assist for Linux kernel, Java VM, and classic Amiga 
emulation"
Hmm...?
