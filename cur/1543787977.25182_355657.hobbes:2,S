I should probably have CC'd it... oh well, this isn't terribly important
at this point but I'll do if I post a new release. It's powermac
specific anyway.

So far, only single CPU machines shipped with an SMU.

There are several problems (and that leads to problems in the cpufreq
core too btw). The problem with the cpufreq core is that it disables
adjusting of loops_per_jiffies when CONFIG_SMP is set. That can lead to
pretty disastrous results when running an SMP kernel on a laptop...
Fortunately, the driver provided by this patch doesn't need it as ppc64
has constants loops_per_jiffies (it uses the HW timebase which doesn't
change frequency).
The other problem is that the 970FX "PowerTune" mecanism will actually
broadcast messages to the bus that sync all CPUs to the same speed. That
is, all CPUs in the machine will always change frequency simultaneously,
thus the whole SMP stuff doesn't make that much sense, and I'm not sure
how to "inform" the cpufreq core of that fact (that changing one CPU
actually triggered a change of all of them).
But as I wrote earlier, there is currently no PowerMac SMP machine that
has an SMU chip and a 970FX to which this driver would apply.
Finally, as for preventing build with CONFIG_SMP, I think distros would
kill me as I don't know any of them who intends to ship a G5 kernel with
CONFIG_SMP disabled :)

I didn't find. Apple didn't bother putting it in the OF device-tree
afaik, and while it might be in one of the undocumented SMU data
partitions, I have no way to know. The problem isn't the frequency
switch per-se which is extremely fast (and I could know), but the
voltage switch that goes with it. I suppose I could measure and put an
overestimated value in there, but that isn't critical for now. userland
powernowd & friends work fine and I need the reduced frequency mostly
for the thermal control driver so it can clamp it down when the CPU
overtemps.

Which is what I want for now, until I find out more about how well I can
make them to work with those machines :)
Let's call that a "conservative" approach ;)
