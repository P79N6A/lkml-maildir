Lets try to narrow it down a bit:
aio-stress -o 3 -d 1 will set the depth to 1, (io_submit then wait one request 
at a time).  This doesn't take the aio subsystem out of the picture, but it 
does make the block layer interaction more or less the same as non-aio 
benchmarks.  If this is slow, I would suspect something in the block layer, 
and iozone -I -i 2 -w -f testext3/rwfile5 should also show the regression.
If it doesn't regress, I would suspect something in the aio core.  My first 
attempts at the context switch reduction patches caused this kind of 
regression.  There was too much latency in sending the events up to userland.
Other options:
Try different elevators
Try O_SYNC aio random writes
Try aio random reads
Try buffers random reads
