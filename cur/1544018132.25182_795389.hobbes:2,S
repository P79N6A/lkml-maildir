i think lockdep could be expanded into production use via code patching 
techniques.
So in that sense the rearm bit could be useful - it would give us a 
lockdep variant that would run for the first 5 minutes of uptime (where 
90% of all lockdep reports trigger: lockdep maps the dependencies very 
quickly) - and could turn itself off after that, and patch out / disable 
its callbacks.
The memory footprint would still remain, but that is not nearly as much of 
a problem for production systems as runtime overhead.
