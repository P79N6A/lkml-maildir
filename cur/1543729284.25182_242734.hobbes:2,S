I, dont think, that running cdrecord suid root is a risk, but i think, that 
there are much more cd-recording applications, not based on cdrecord, which 
may be insecure. Or perhaps someone will write a little programm, wich will 
override the firmware.
I think its a good way to filter the commands within the kernel. Its a 
additional security-barrage.
