Another few cases, taken from semi random locations from my log to get
the many different data, maybe some of it can help out.
Weirdness 1: I have 3 machines, that decide to spew this garbage within
the same second? (smartd running at it is around the hour that smartd
would run, but it's just this one day Sep 28 that horrible bad)
Note 1: Bad/failing hardware creates these type of errors.
Note 2: The hardware didn't freeze for me and I believe the freeze is do
to swap breaking due to the errors.
Note 3: dragonslair's harddisk actually crashed, kernel didn't die, it
just remounted read only. Reboot and the disk was missing, more reboot
and the machine started with all disks running again, been stable since
the 28th Sep. (knock on wood)
Note 4: I've changed hardware and kernel in a non controled manner, so I
was waiting for another case of these errors where I would be able to
write down kernel config.
I'm not sure, but I do believe that a keyword with this stuff is SMP and
2.6.22, older kernels doesn't seem to trigger this and non SMP seems to
avoid it with 2.6.22, but I can't trigger the error, so there is no way
of knowing if the conclusion can be trusted.
Dragonslair:
P4 x2 3.0 Ghz
Chips Intel 865GV & ICH5
32bit SMP kernel (2.6.22)
2 SATA disks WDC WD800JD-75MSA3
(I'm guessing this one has a physical bad disk, since it's the only one
the disk has physically failed and the only one with a worrying SMART
error: 1 Raw_Read_Error_Rate 0x000f 200 200 051 Pre-fail Always - 5)
Locker:
AMD 64x2
Chips Nvidia 570
32bit SMP kernel (2.6.22)

Liferaft:
