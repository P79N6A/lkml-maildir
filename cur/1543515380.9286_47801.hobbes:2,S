Try using the option 'noipdefault' on your /etc/ppp/options file and check
whether it solves the problem.

This is something I've never heard before. It might actually be a PPPd /
kernel PPP bug.

This is something that happens when you ask pppd to use the IP address of
the first available interface on your system as the local PPP IP address
(option 'ipdefault'). If you use the option 'noipdefault', that should
_not_ happen.
Nevertheless, the specific issue of different network configuration
affecting the occurrence of the problem certainly sounds like a bug.
