Subject: [PATCH for 2.6.23] [3/3] i386: fix a hang on stuck nmi watchdog
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Daniel Walker <dwalker@mvista.com>
In the case when an nmi gets stucks the endflag stays equal to zero. This
causes the busy looping on other cpus to continue, even tho the nmi test
is done.
On my machine with out the change below the system would hang right after
check_nmi_watchdog(). The change below just sets endflag prior to checking
if the test was successful or not.
