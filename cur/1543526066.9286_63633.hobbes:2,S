Hi all:
I have been playing with the 2.3.43 release over the last couple of days.
I am trying to incorporate USB into the kernel (not as a module).  I have
a RH6.1 system on a PII.  I can compile in the support for USB and for
Kodak Cameras without any trouble.  I also need to include support for the
USB filesystem (called CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS).  When I include this option,
however, my 'make bzImage' fails with 
make -C usb

make all_targets

So, I backed up to the version 2.3.40, and that compiled.  I am not ruling
out an error on my part :)  Is anyone familar with this problem?
