Can't you just tar the small files from the backupserver to tape? (or,
what is the problem with that?).

You also do incremental backups?

How many parallel streams can the system currently handle before the
write bandwith gets unacceptable?

What mount options? And how many disks?

That is not a sign of instability per se AFAIK.

How is the cache configured in the bios?

Would it be possible to test software raid to see if that gives
different numbers?
