The patches have an application with hugepage pool resizing.
When lumpy-reclaim is used used with ZONE_MOVABLE, the hugepages pool can
be resized with greater reliability. Testing on a desktop machine with 2GB
of RAM showed that growing the hugepage pool with ZONE_MOVABLE on it's own
was very slow as the success rate was quite low. Without lumpy-reclaim, each
attempt to grow the pool by 100 pages would yield 1 or 2 hugepages. With
lumpy-reclaim, getting 40 to 70 hugepages on each attempt was typical.
