It's git@vger.kernel.org.
If you post there more specifics about what you tried and what the
results were, they might be able to figure out what happened.
Also, specifics about which documentation you read would help improve
the docs.  I believe that the in-tree beginner's documentation (the
"tutorial" and the "user manual"--also the first hits for "git tutorial"
and "git user manual" on google) explain how to do what you need, but
perhaps it's not obvious where.
