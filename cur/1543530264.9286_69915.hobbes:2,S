I cannot mount the device.  If I try mount /dev/sda4 /zip
or if I specify a type it says invalid type or something like
that and does not mount it.
What would I gain by using dd?  Or how would I use if to fix the
problem?
I guess I could copy it or copy be able to mount it to see what
is on it fisrt under Linux.  Although this is only one disk, I
am interested in finding out how to fix this and prevent it in
the future.  
Does file work on scsi devices like /dev/sda4?  
Joe
