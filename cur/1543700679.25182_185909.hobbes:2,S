Sorry. I'm outdated. ;-)
But, why not support a opensource format like PNG?
And yes, now is expired but i think that we (the kernel users) used the
gif format one year ago (I think that it's trivial to check that 2.4.x
series used gif format. So they (patent registers of LZW) might demand
the money that we did not pay to their.
