Please explain me couple of things.
1) I have / on filesystem, compiled as module, and have initial ram disk 
(initrd), with
    FS module, static insmod binary, linuxrc and so. So how kernel access 
initrd file at the boot time,
    when it doesn't understand FS on /? Which role plays lilo?
2) How to intercept system calls in 2.6 ? Old technique dont work any more 
'cause absence of
    syscall_table[].
