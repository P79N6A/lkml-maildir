Hardware like you describe violates the PCI spec and it should not be
expected that Linux will support it in the general case. It sounds
like this is some kind of prototype hardware.
I would probably handle this by writing an unbound device driver that
exposes a sysfs file for bus:slot. When you write the bus:slot to the
file it would then bind to the appropriate hardware and enable it. The
newly bound driver would support the driver firmware loader interface
as a means of getting your data in.
