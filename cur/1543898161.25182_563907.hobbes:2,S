Don't you think that organized (i.e. Cc *management*: tracking system
sends copies to _interested people_, as it was recorded earlier, or
changed due to bouncing or off-line people; by-patch tracking
of changes, tests, bugs, rc-bugs) way of dealing with patches is bad,
but yet another fancy SPAM generator script and mess in
___kernel sources___ is OK just for publishing one's patches-ches-es?
Having seen how bitkeeper improved *management* things in 2.5 - early2.6
period, i have no problem to blame propositions as yours.
Heck, going to be another useless post...
