There definitely is.  The kernel needs to export its ABI in a way that
userspace (UML, various libcs, etc) can import in a sane manner.  In
addition, the Linux kernel contains a fair bit of
architecture-specific support which go well beyond what one can
typically find in userspace, and it would be nice to have those.
The current linux-libc-headers aren't it, because they have a fair bit
of glibc-centric assumptions in those headers.  That's part of why
klibc doesn't use them.
We should probably also consider the licensing of headers that are
meant to be included into userspace.  Userspace still includes a fair
bit of GPL headers, which is technically not kosher.
