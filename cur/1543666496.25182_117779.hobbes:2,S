I don't disagree with you, it's just that this most recent thread was
mainly about how the CVS gateway is/was lacking. (unless I'm missing the
whole point). I would challenge any corporation to do what Larry has
done, and tackle SCM to the best of his charitable ability for linux
kernel development. Having said that, I'll say that of course concerns
of the past had validity to them. So, if I'm not mistaken, I think we're
agreeing.

Ditto on -ac... Actually, all you hard hitters kindof amaze me. I
appreciate all y'all. And of course, I'm not saying go back to patches.
It's just that when bk was offered as a solution, strings attached or
no, it added a lot of sanity to the way changes are introduced into the
kernel, and thankfully historical comments and whatever other metadata.
Before that there was only lkml.
I'll try to clarify the point I was trying to make... Some all-too-vocal
folks, even after the bk -> cvs gateway was created were saying "not
good enough" because it was "lossy". It is the fact that bk -> cvs
couldn't possibly lose any more than was lost inherently by not using
bk. in other syntax...
	lossiness("BK-to-CVS gw") == BK - "diff/patch"
Basically, it's Linus's tree. He can get /all/ the meta-data out at will
and convert it if he pleases, regardless of the discussions going on
here. In any case, Larry is busy coding up "BitchKeeper" so threads like
this can be managed more efficiently ;P
