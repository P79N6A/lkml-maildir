Yes, these are TCP sockets.  I do see some errors with regard to too many
open files, but not before the buffer error.

	Are these TCP sockets? It can take around 2 minutes to close a TCP 
connection. So 1,000 opens/closes a second could potentially mean 120,000 
connections sitting around. Are you sure you aren't running out of local 
ports or something else?

	Which system call returns the error? socket? bind? send? receive?
	And why are you using so many threads? Are you under the
misperception that 
you need lots of thread to do lots of work? Perhaps your architecture is a 
major part of the problem.
