that is true and it does not contradict the purpose and intention of 
drivers/staging/ though - it extends it.
We could create drivers/staging/in/ and drivers/staging/out/.
So instead of marking drivers CONFIG_BROKEN we could move them to 
drivers/staging/out/ - and if they dont get 'saved' within a kernel 
release they will be zapped for good. That is more gradual than a sudden 
'remove a driver completely' action.
