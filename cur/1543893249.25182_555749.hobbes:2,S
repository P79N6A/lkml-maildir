Then maybe the submit_bio logic should only be done for the ->write
path, not for ->read. The data that gets written out should already
be present in the page cache for the files, so there is not much point
having again, while you can see the read path as blockdev readahead:
When you read a physical block that contains a logical block, it's
likely to also contain part of another logical block that is going
to be read in the near future.
This way, you would also get exclusively clean pages in the block
device address_space, which can be easily discarded.
Also, maintaining correct ordering between write requests can be
done easier if you insert the bios directly, instead of waiting
for the lru writeback.
