Thanks, Paolo, Markus,
I just tried out
modprobe loop max_loop=32
output of dmesg is:
[  457.607575] loop: the max_loop option is obsolete and will be
removed in March 2008
[  457.607578] loop: module loaded
but there are NO loop devices in /dev:
ls -l /dev/ | grep loop
still shows nothing, strange ...
so I'll stick to .22-rc4 with that patch (works, as far as creation of
loop devices are concerned)
Regards
