The veto stuff only comes into action, iff someone has registered as
willing to exercise this power. We would not break compatibility with
any std kernel by instead having a apmd send a "reject all" ioctl
instead, and so deal with events without having the pressure of having
to reject or accept them, and let us remove all the veto code from the
kernel driver. Or am I missing something?
