FWIW the current ALSA patch against 2.6.12 works much better than
the original version for my Asus W3V with Intel HDA ALC880 in the sense
that there's a possibility to prevent crashing the kernel when loading
the module. However apart from the ID fixes this involves disabling the
autodetection code and hardcoding the correct type in the realtek code.
As it stands the code seems to be really buggy and I'd love to test the
driver after someone wiser than me in this area reviewed and fixed the
code.
Servus,
