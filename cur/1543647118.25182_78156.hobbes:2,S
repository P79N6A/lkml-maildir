This is there as a 'printk' deliberately.  It warns you that what you
are doing isn't really supported and will cause a substantial
performance hit (as all IO to the array is completely serialised
around one of these messages).
If you want to make it PRITNK for yourself, that is fine.  But I would
rather it stayed as printk in the mainstream kernel untill the root
problem is fixed (and I have seen patches that possibly fix the
problem, but I haven't had a chance to look at them).
