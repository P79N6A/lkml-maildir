Im suprised it gets that far

With that many servers and a sudden load you are probably causing a lot of
paging. What kernel version. And while this isnt a solution to kernel issues
take a look at thttpd instead (www.acme.com). If you have 1500 8K stacks 
thrashing in your cache you are not going to have good performance.
