 Still it's quite dumb you *have* to specify "ip=<whatever>" whenever you
specify "root=nfs" to boot successfully, since the latter usually implies
you need IP to work.  I have a hack that fixes it (I need it due to a
37-character limit of a bootstrap command line in a firmware), but I
recall a discussion the conclusion of which was the current behaviour is
blessed, so I didn't even try to bother anyone with it...
