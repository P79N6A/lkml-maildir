Thanks for pointing that out - I should have read patch-2.6.9 more
carefully. I'll add that to the setkeycodes.8 man page.
Nevertheless I disagree a bit. "raw mode" is by definition the mode
where scan codes are passed unmodified to user space.
So before 2.6.9 this was just broken, and since 2.6.9 it is broken
by default but there is a boot option to make it work.
What is the reason that you do not make this the default?
The current default is really messy and confusing, especially
when people have to map keys using setkeycodes.

BTW, now that I read the corresponding code:
        if (atkbd_softrepeat)
                atkbd_softraw = 1;
        if (!atkbd_softrepeat) {
                atkbd->dev.rep[REP_DELAY] = 250;
                atkbd->dev.rep[REP_PERIOD] = 33;
        } else atkbd_softraw = 1;
The "else" part is superfluous.
