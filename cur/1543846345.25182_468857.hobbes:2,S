Well in the DRM case we don't worry about that too much, the external
DRM git tree has all the compat code hidden away and I've got lots of
version check macros, so one more won't make a difference, the in-tree
version has none of the that stuff anyways....
Now it might break nvidia and ATI but that is all code that is in
their "public" source...
Dave.
