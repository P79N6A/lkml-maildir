udev-030 is looking for detached_state somewhere inside /sys tree,
but somewhere between 2.6.12-rc3 and -rc5 detached_state is gone.
I installed udev-058 and it fixed things.
It took me more than hour to figure out, from 02:00 to after 03:00.
Greg, any plans to distribute udev and hotplug within kernel tarballs
so that people do not need to track such changes continuously?
After all, udev is tied to /sys layout which changes with kernel
and also udev is vital for properly functioning boot process
(I mean: if udev breaks, you cannot easily debug it: your box
is unusable since lots of things gone avry like gettys not having ttys
to let you log in...).
