A prio qdisc for example can hold packets indefinitely as long as a higher
prio flow is active. I actually experienced problems unloading ip_conntrack
while playing with qdiscs until I removed the qdisc, but I hacked some stuff
before so it could be my own fault (and sometimes removing the qdisc didn't
help either). Anyways, it may be a corner case but I'm pretty sure there are
no lost references in ip_conntrack itself so maybe some of the sporadic
reports of hanging unload could be explained by this. I'm going to do some
more testing and then we can see.
Best regards,
Patrick
