   Ah yes, I was going to mention that, but didn't know which way would be
   better.  My instinct tells me the massively parallel, but I could and
   probably am wrong again. :)
Using a tree (what you are calling massively parallel) for
distribution produces a uniform voltage drop for all of the devices,
and has a better worst-case voltage drop than a serial chaining
distribution.  The serial chain has different voltage drops for each
pair of disks, depending on how far down the chain they are, but the
worst case is very bad.
The reason is that the tree has O(log N) depth, and the serial chain
has O(N) depth.
