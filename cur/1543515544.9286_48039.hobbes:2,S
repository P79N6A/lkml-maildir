Indeed they may be used so, but it is the actual memory that will be
zeroed with the cache invalidating or snooping the accesses. May-be having
some pool of zeroed memory or zeroing some memory is useful for security
issue, but speaking of pooled or cached objects, we probably want to most
of the time reuse constructed instances that have been stated free and
only zero parts that need to be so. The bzero-mania does not look fine
programming to me.
Btw, I probably missed most of the the discussion since I didn't follow
it. :-)
Gérard.
PS: If we want to be able to write zero-filled blocks to a disk without
bzero overhead, for example, we can reserve a small amount of physical
pages filled with zeros at startup.
