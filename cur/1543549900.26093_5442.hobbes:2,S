	Ciscos solution to this involves 'KeepAlive' packets.  They
default to on for a FastEtherChannel link, and each sub-interface
sends then every 10 seconds (default, configable), and expects to
receive them as well.  If it does not it takes down the sub interface
until keepalives return.
	Unfortunately I have not been able to find any documentation on
the Cisco FastEtherChannel KeepAlive protocol, it would be nice to add
this to Linux Bonding.  Its kind of a dirty fix, but it would fix link
state issues, and be compat with Cisco EtherChannel, Sun
EtherTrunking, and the Adaptec DuraLan bonding systems.
