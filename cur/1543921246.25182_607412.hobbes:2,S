Yeah, I looked at the changes and it's all very innocent looking.
More likely in my case, I suppose, is that the bug was there earlier
and then some timing changed somewhere and now it triggers more often.
One supporting evidence of that, is that with the powertop patches applied,
it crashes much less often.  And all that those do is adjust timings in
various places.

Core2Duo, 2GB, x86-32, CONFIG_HIGHPTE is not set.

It seems to happen most often here on resume from suspend (RAM),
and when hotplugging hardware.  But it's infrequent enough that this
may not be a reliable clue.
