Better still, on machines without ll/sc we can do down_trylock as:
	return atomic_read(&sem->count) <= 0
		|| atomic_add_negative(-1, &sem->count);
Then we will only take the slow path unnecessarily on up() if another
cpu decrements the count between the test and the atomic_add_negative,
which should be very rare.  Doing the test will also avoid doing the
atomic op if the semaphore is already held.
