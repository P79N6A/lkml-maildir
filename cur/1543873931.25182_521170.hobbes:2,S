AFAIK, exit_signal = -1 means that the parent don't want to be signalled,
like what happenes when using CLONE_THREAD. 
But it's even signalled in that case (after issuing a BUG):
   BUG_ON(leader->exit_signal == -1);
   do_notify_parent(leader, leader->exit_signal);

Yes it does the check but it notifies the given task_struct anyway:
	BUG_ON(sig == -1);
	[ Continue parent notification normally ]
