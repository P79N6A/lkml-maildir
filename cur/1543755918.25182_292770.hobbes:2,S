Subject: Can't remove a module because of new policy

There is more and more policy being put into the kernel
and utilities. Now I can't remove a module because whoever
made the new module-init-tools decided that they didn't like
its name even though it was installed and running.
In the following I explicitly tell `rmmod` to remove a module
with the name "DAS-Link". The "(!@$*!@#^(" program decides
that I don't know what I am doing and attempts to
remove "DAS_Link" which I never typed, never called for,
and should never have even been even guessed.

ERROR: Module DAS_Link does not exist in /proc/modules

So, I suppose this name is no longer valid?? If so, this
means that hundreds of installed machines can't be updated
in the field.
Cheers,
