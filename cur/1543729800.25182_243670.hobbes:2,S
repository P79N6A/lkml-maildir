well, 9 msecs is still not nice. I've been able to trigger larger than
10msec latencies too on a 2 GHz box.

hm, tcp_collapse() in net/ipv4/tcp_input.c. Could you try to just return
from that function?  Collapsing skbs of a given socket is not a
necessary functionality (it is only a 'nice' thing to have in OOM
situations) and it indeed can introduce quite high latencies.
