I think parisc should be allowed to choose their implementation of
semaphores.  Look, if you change semaphores in some way it will
be their problem to keep their parisc version in sync.
Or you could provide both a spinlocked and an atomic op based implementation
of generic semaphores, as we do for rwsem already.
