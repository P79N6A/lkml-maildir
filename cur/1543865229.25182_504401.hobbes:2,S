I really really welcome your efforts - no doubt.
I wanted to express that the patches you posted are simply not
suitable for lkml discussion as there was no full patchset for
lirc for review posted, prior to your patches.
Normal process for new features (and lirc is a new feature so
far lkml is concerned) is like (as I understand it):
  1. post full patchset
  2. duck
  3. receive criticism & patches
  4. integrate results from 3
  5. goto 1
You started at 3. It would be better to start with the whole
picture at 1.
I hope I made myself clearer now.
Jan
