Hi, Roland -
This patch series brings the ipath driver almost up to date with what's
in our internal tree.  The only substantial thing missing is the
memcpy_cachebypass patch that I sent out a while back and haven't had
time to rework.
These patches have seen a lot of testing, including on a git snapshot
as of yesterday afternoon.  Please apply.
Thanks,
	<b
