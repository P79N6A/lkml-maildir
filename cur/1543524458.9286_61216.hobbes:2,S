Subject: tulip.c broken, old_tulip works - how do I help debugging?

Hi,
I have one of these "NetGear" 10/100MBit PCI ethernet devices. When I use
the tulip driver, I can connect to my machine normally for some time, but
after a period of inactivity (minutes, sometimes hours) when I try to
connect again, the connection is gone. ifconfig eth0 down, rmmod tulip,
ifconfig eth0 ... up has always solved the problem, but this is not really
a solution. the old_tulip works for me, for now at least.
Question: Is there any demand in debugging this or is the tulip knowingly
broken and this is a known bug? If you want me to debug it, how would I go
about it?
