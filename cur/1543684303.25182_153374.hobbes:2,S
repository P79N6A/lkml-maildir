I'm currently using hvr's testing cryptoAPI patches for 2.4.x, and I
have a block device encrypted with 256 bits serpent. This cannot be
correctly decrypted with linux-2.6.0-test2. Has something in the use
of serpent changed since then (or has block numbering changed again)?
Or should I go bug-hunting?
