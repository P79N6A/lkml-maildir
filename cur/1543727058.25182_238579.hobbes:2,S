Hmm. That's what I was doing and do do for the remainder of the devices.
Oh well. I'll give it a try again. What would 3 do? (There was a stage
when all three implementations used 3; I've just played sheep in
changing to 4).
It occurs to me that I'm going to need to extend the partial tree
handling anyway. When I get this working, I'm going to want to resume
only the storage devices, and haven't added code for that yet.
Regards,
Nigel
