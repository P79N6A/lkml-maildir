The user-mode port of 2.4.0-prerelease is available.
hostfs is more improved.  Writing files really works now.  Executing binaries 
also works.  There is still some memory corruption, though.
I fixed the swapoff crash.
The input to consoles and serial lines is now much more general.  You can 
attach them to ptys, ttys, and ports now, with a few more interfaces to come.
