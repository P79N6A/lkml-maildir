I'm not sure how breaking our code with your set of patches qualifies as
finding a weakness.  I will agree that the current handling of sysctl in
selinux is fragile and can be improved, but it did work (prior to your
patches).

I think you misunderstand; we are concerned about the correctness of our
implementation.  I think that possibly you are misunderstanding one of
the SELinux FAQ answers outside of its historical context (the initial
release of a proof-of-concept implementation of flexible MAC in Dec
2000).

Which we appreciate, although it would be nice if you tried building
with selinux (and ideally testing with it) in the first place.

To clarify, in this case, the pathname (relative to the root of proc) is
derived from the proc_dir_entry hierarchy and is thus not ambiguous or
mutable by userspace, unlike the pathname-based approaches that we have
criticized.  There is a difference.  But we are open to improving the
approach via explicit marking of the ctl_table entries with sufficient
information.

Good.
