yeah, I've been emailing Dor -- it sounds like he'll have stuff ready
for the 2.6.24 merge window -- that being the case, I'll write a
virtio transport and mothball the PCI and lguest transports.  They
were straightforward to write (a couple hours for the lguest
transport) and the lguest transport was a good learning experience --
so I'm not shedding tears over wasted effort.
