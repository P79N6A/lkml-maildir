Once you're confirmed non-relaying, you won't get probed for 5 months

Since the probe only registers relays when the probe message actually gets
delivered, your "intelligent" spam filter isn't working if you got
registered.

ORBS is nice because you can get off it very fast, MAPS takes human
intervention to get off.
