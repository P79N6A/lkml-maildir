One major problem with that: unless you accept bare allow and/or select
(not as part of config <something>), we _still_ get these noise symbols,
just to have some place where that "allow" clause could live.
IOW, you get something like
config I_DONT_WANT_TO_CALL_THAT_ARCH_HAS_SOMETHING
	bool
	default y
	allow BLK_DEV_FD
in the same places where I do
config ARCH_MIGHT_HAVE_PC_FDC
	default y
with the only difference being that in your variant symbol will be 100%
semantics-free - it's just a workaround for Kconfig syntax problem.
Are you up to such change?  If so, I'll just take current patch and do
pretty much a search-and-replace on it, turning unconditional instances
of these suckers (i.e. in absense of subarchitectures) into plain
# there's a glue for PC-like FDC
allow BLD_DEV_FD
If you insist on having dummy config around allow/select, I don't see any
real benefits in using "allow" form...
