Subject: [bttv/tuner] Invalid hard-coded frequency in FM tuner driver(s).

I'm now trying to configure FM tuner that came in set with
fairly standard Bt848 + Phillips tuner (NTSC) card.
But it seems hard-coded frequency value in driver is preventing
me from using the tuner (I know I SHOULD be able to configure
this hardware, because I was able to do it on Windows).
When I looked into drivers/char/bttv.c (or any other tuner driver
source), all of them hard-coded frequency range to 87.5MHz - 108MHz.
So it's like this:
  static int radio_ioctl(...) {
    struct video_tuner v;
    ...
    v.rangelow  = (int)(87.5 * 16); /* 87.5MHz */
    v.rangehigh = (int)(108 * 16);  /* 108MHz  */
Unfortunately, this frequency range differs from region to region,
and range of 76.0MHz - 89.9MHz is used in my country.
Shouldn't these values be configurable by ioctl(2) call if they
can't be auto-configured from hardware information?
# It seems the author of bttv driver is aware of this possibility
# as comment "/* XXX - anything to do ??? */" was in that part of
# the code.
