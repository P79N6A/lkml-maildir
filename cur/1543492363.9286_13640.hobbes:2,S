Actually, Henner Eisen <eis@baty.hanse.de> had taken it upon himself to
feed the cvs version in (incremental but working) parts, as apparently
Linus' biggest complaint was that he would never accept the large patch
necessary for getting the 2.2.x isdn stuff up to the (stable) cvs
version in one go (hence the parts).
He sent you (Alan) a patch for the link level in the first week of
February, for inclusion in your 2.2.2ac series (at that time). It
was basically the cvs link level with the TIMRU and BUDGET extensions
taken out, as those aren't "clean" enough. I assume he's waiting to
see that appear before he's able to send the next patch.
So, Alan, have you lost / rejected / ignored that patch? I'm curious
as to the status...
