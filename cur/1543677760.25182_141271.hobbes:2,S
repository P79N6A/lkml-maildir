I'm running a cisco aironet 350 series on 2.5.72.  When attempting to
load the module, I get the following messages:
airo:  Probing for PCI adapters
airo:  Finished probing for PCI adapters
airo: register interrupt 0 failed, rc -16
airo_cs: RequestConfiguration: Operation succeeded
All pcmcia drivers are loaded, I've tried both compiled in and as
modules.  The same card works with no problems on 2.4.[18-21].  Google
only shows one match with no resolution to the problem.  Any ideas?
