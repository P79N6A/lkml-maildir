Switching from one vt to another receives hardly any response.
This is especially visible in spa_no_frills, and spa_ws recovers from this 
lockup somewhat and starts exhibiting this problem as a choking behavior.
Running '# top d.1 (then shift T)' on another vt shows this choking behavior 
as the proc gets boosted.

This depends on your machine's performance.  On my 400MhzP2 UP 128MB, w/ 
spa_no_frills default settings, looping eatm 9999 takes 63ms per eat and 
causes the rest of the system to be starved.  Raising kb to 19999 takes 
126ms which is greater than the default 120ms timeslice and causes no system 
starvation.
What numbers do you get?
Thanks!
