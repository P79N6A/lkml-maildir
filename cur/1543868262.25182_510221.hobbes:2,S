If you do something like "cat < ttyS10" it will work by opening the
device just like a user space application --- but the shell, which is
opening /dev/ttyS10, won't use any of the special flags that a user
space application might use to not wait for the carrier detect line to
go high, for example.  
I'd have to see the sources of the driver and your user space
application to be sure, but one thing you should try is "stty -F
/dev/ttyS10 clocal" and see if that allows "cat < /dev/ttyS10" to
work.
