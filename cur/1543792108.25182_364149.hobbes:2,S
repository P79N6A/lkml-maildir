+What:	Video4Linux API 1 ioctls and video_decoder.h from Video devices.
+When:	July 2006
+Why:	V4L1 AP1 was replaced by V4L2 API. during migration from 2.4 to 2.6
+	series. The old API have lots of drawbacks and don't provide enough
+	means to work with all video and audio standards. The newer API is 
+	already available on the main drivers and should be used instead.
+	Newer drivers should use v4l_compat_translate_ioctl function to handle
+	old calls, replacing to newer ones.
+	Decoder iocts are using internally to allow video drivers to
+	communicate with video decoders. This should also be improved to allow
+	V4L2 calls being translated into compatible internal ioctls.
