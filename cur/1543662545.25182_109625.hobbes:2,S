I admit not having thoroughly read the source to check - is the userspace API
for accessing  all these chips fairly uniform and rational, so that a user
program can be reasonably sure that if stat("/dev/watchdog") returns zero, that
it knows how to deal with it?  Or are they all sufficiently close to the "keep
reloading a countdown timer from userspace, and if it ever doesn't get reloaded,
kick the kernel in the seat of the pants" programming model?  Of course, even
a disagreement on the units of the timer could be bad - a seconds/milliseconds
clash could result is a *real* fast lack-of-joy situation.. ;)
