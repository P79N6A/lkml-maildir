Lets' let this testing cycle go a little longer before making any
changes.. Let developers catch up..
My own kernel patches I had to stop because I couldn't keep up ....  Can
we go a full month with you just hitting us over the head with a bat
yelling 'test, dammit, test', until this is tested fully before
releasing another production release?
I would like to get a chance to test this one on more than one hardware
platform :) And I want to test it under production loads as well..
