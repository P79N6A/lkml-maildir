Other compilers do exist.
Over the years I've personally used a few to compile userspace apps
for different projects (though never for compiling the kernel).
Some of the compilers I have personally used for userspace apps on
Linux include ;
lcc   - 
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/
tcc   - 
http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc/
(plus gcc & icc ofcourse)
Others that I know of but have never used include :
sdcc   - 
http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/
Compaq C for Linux   - 
http://h30097.www3.hp.com/linux/compaq_c/index.html
Open Watcom   - 
http://www.openwatcom.org/
vacpp   - 
http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/vacpp/
XL C/C++   - 
http://www.absoft.com/Products/Compilers/C_C
++/Linux/XLC/XLC.html
and I'm sure many more exist...
