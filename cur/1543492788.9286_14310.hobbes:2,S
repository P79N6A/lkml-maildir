IMO people are missing the point. AT emulation is ugly and _should_
not be done except for compatibility reasons (perhaps in can be done
in userland?).
Out-of-band control of modems is wonderful, I have access servers
which allow this to various degrees and it truly is very useful. The
Lucent modems also do this under Windahs, quite neat... (you can see
speed changes, modem parameters, etc. without interrupting the data
flow).
