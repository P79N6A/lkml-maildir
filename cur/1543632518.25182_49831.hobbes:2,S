Kjartan,
Please do not confuse them, they have a hard enough time reading.
The docs state it can only do X, but lets overclock it and do X+1.
Maybe the hardware is smart and knows which drivers are safe and sane.
Anthony, I sent you a mini-patch to add the 845G to the sane driver.
It will work, as Kjartan has stated.  His system suffered the exact same
events.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
