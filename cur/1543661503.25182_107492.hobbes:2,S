Could be that your "low memory" is filled up with inodes.  This would
only happen in these tests if you're using ext2, and there are a *lot*
of directories.
I've prepared a lineup of Andrea's VM patches at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.4/2.4.21-pre4/
It would be useful if you could apply 10_inode-highmem-2.patch and
report back.  It applies to 2.4.19 as well, and should work OK there.
