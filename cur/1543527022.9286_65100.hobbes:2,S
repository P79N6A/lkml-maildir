the patch didnt fix things for me, it did at least change the errors.
running "mt -f /dev/ht0 retension" gives these kernel messages:
	ide-tape: Reached idetape_chrdev_open
	ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 1e, key =  5, asc = 20, ascq =  0
	ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 1e, key =  5, asc = 20, ascq =  0
the second I/O message shows up at the near end of the retension run,
the first 2 messages show up almost immediately after execution starts.
# tar cvf /dev/ht0 test
test/
test/2.3.40
test/2.3.40pre1
tar: Cannot write to /dev/ht0: Input/output error
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
and the kernel messages:

write attempts via tar do not spin the drive up.
retension does make it spin as does a read attempt via tar. the read attempt
via tar produced the exact same errors the retension test produced (above).
the boot messages relative to the tape drive are exactly the same as in my
previous message.  the kernel is now 2.3.47.
do you think the drive might be going bad, and this is the result?
thanks ahead,
	John
