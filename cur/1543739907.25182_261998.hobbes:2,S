He claims that's not the case (you weren't CC'ed on his reply, but its
on lkml). He believes the time changes before NTP starts up. Might be
something else, but I'm not sure.

I've begun to agree with you about this issue. It seems that until we
can catch every use of jiffies for time, doing one by one is going to
cause consistency problems.  So I'd support the full backout of the
do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime changes to the proc interface. 
George, would you protest this?
As for the timeofday overhaul, I've had zero time to work on it
recently. I hate that I dropped code and then went missing for weeks.
I'll have to see if I can get a few cycles at home to sync up my current
tree and send it out. 
thanks
