Cache effects.  We touch the buffers at prepare_write.  We touch them
again at commit_write().  And at writeout time.  And at page reclaim
time.  I think it's this general white-noise cost which is causing
the funny profiles which I'm seeing.  (For example, with no-buffers,
the cost of the IDE driver setup and interrupt handler has nosedived).

For writes, we have the lru list insertion, and the hashtable lock (twice).

mm..  Delayed allocation means that the short-lived files never get
a disk mapping at all.
And yes, if all files are 100% fragmented then the BIO aggregation
doesn't help as much.

bh represents a disk block.  It's a wrapper around a section of the
block device's pagecache pages.  We'll always need a representation
of disk blocks.  For filesystem metadata.
