It would be nice, since it claims to be "generic", to support things
brought forward by other tracers like LTTng, such as : multiple channels
(for low, medium and high event rate data, with user-selectable sizes),
hybrid trace mode (combined normal trace channels and flight recorder
channels).

I really hope nobody is willing to call gtsc_printf from an interrupt
