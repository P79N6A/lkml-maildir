If this is James's final opininion, then the changes to st for 2.6.16 
to use scsi_execute_async _must be reverted_ before final 2.6.16. They 
cause user-visible regression.
I don't think relying on coalescing in this case is non-deterministic: we 
know that enough pages are adjacent to coalesce. This is because the pages 
have been split into bios from larger kernel space buffers. (Conceptually 
I don't like this splitting and re-merging but it works provided the HBA 
parameters are good.)
I am a little frustrated with this whole thing. Several people have talked 
about switching st to use the block layer. Mike Christie finally did the 
work and the details were discussed on linux-scsi. I thought that 
everybody agreed on the details and I tested that the code works for st. 
Now it seems that there was no agreement!

Learn the hard way ;-( I know that there are applications that read and 
write large tape blocks but I think they will hit the problems much later. 
These are production systems that are probably not updated frequently. 
When they find out this, they probably have to move away from Linux.
I have talked about st but I think the same arguments apply mostly to sg.
