Except that this isn't currently possible if you're also trying to do
memory hardwalling on those cpusets, since then sibling cpusets can't
share memory nodes.
Having said that, this bit of the problem can be fixed without
splitting cpus/mems, by my other earlier proposal of adding a separate
"mem_hardwall" flag that can enable the hardwall behaviour without the
exclusive behaviour. (i.e. hardwall behaviour occurs if mem_exclusive
|| mem_hardwall)
