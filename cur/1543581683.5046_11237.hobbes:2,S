Progress: not only did I goof, I was wrong too.
This time it booted once the network timed out, but the eepro is not
functioning properly; it seems unable to receive. I can see it sends alright
from the dhcpserver log.
IRQ's are now
   Mylex    10
   aic7880  17
   eepro    18
   VGA      19
Mylex still hangs without nosmp. IRQ routing problem in APIC initialization,
maybe?
Darn this old piece of junk is slow to boot...
