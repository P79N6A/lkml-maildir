It is designed to allow you to overide a FastTrack BIOS that disables a
few items in pci-config space.  Regardless if you have a FastTrack or
Ultra, if enabled the device can be registered.  If you have a FastTrack
and want to use ata-raid by Arjan V. and not the OEM scsi binary driver,
you must enable the override.  If you want to use the OEM scsi binary
driver with FastTrack, do not set the override.  Ultra's do not care.
If they do it is a BUG!
Cheers,
