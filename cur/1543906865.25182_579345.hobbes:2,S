Hi,
with the old rtc.ko module, there was a /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq 
that could be set. With rtc_cmos.ko (or the new rtc infrastructure in 
general), I am missing this file. Where can I set the max-user-freq now, 
or is this obsolete now? (mplayer prefers to have user-freq to be >= 1024.)
thanks,
	Jan
