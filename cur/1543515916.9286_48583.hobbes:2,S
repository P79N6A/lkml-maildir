Dmitry,
You have made a very good argument, don't know how a balance can be
struck.  Work-arounds, believe that phrase was coined by Ashton-Tate
of dBASE fame, will always be necessary.  Developers only see technical
excellent, and that is good, but end user need functional software
because they have a job to do, that is good too.

It is a piece of cake and fun.  Read The Linux Kernel HOWTO it is worth
your time.

Most end-users (ordinary) will procure a distribution and it will be their
(SuSE, Red Hat, ...) responsibility to make sure everything works.

Nothing wrong with that.
Have great weekend and if you need any help with the kernel just ask.
I have >6 years experience building kernels.  I too was scared the first
time, it passes :-)
