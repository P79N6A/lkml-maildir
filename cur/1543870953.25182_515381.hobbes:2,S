Guilt v0.21 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).
Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

Git repo:

There have been a lot of changes since v0.20. Some of the most important
ones, include...
1) Allow command abbreviation: 'guilt ser' will have the same effect as
   'guilt series'
2) "guilt push" behavior now matches "quilt push" when patch doesn't apply
3) guilt and guilt-init got a manpage (more will follow in future releases)
4) guilt-import-commit now saves the git Author field as the 'From:' line in
   the patch
5) guilt-refresh checks if there is a patch applied before trying to refresh
   changes
6) Several sanity checks
I know I either say it, or at least think it each time I make a release, but
really, this is the best release of Guilt yet. :)
As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.
Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
