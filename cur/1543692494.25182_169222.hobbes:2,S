 You need to append resume=/dev/your_swap_partition to kernel command
 line. Then you suspend by echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep.
 
+Pavel's unreliable guide to swsusp mess
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
+
+They are currently two versions of swap suspend in the kernel, old
+"Pavel's" version in kernel/power/swsusp.c and new "Patrick's" version
+in kernel/power/pmdisk.c. They provide same functionality; old version
+looks ugly but was tested, while new version looks nicer but did not
+receive so much testing. echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep calls old version,
+echo disk > /sys/power/state calls new one.
+
+[In future, when new version is stable enough, two things can happen
+
+* new version is moved into swsusp.c, and swsusp is renamed to swap
+  suspend (Pavel prefers this)
+
+* pmdisk is kept as is and swsusp.c is removed from kernel]
+
 [Notice. Rest docs is pretty outdated (see date!) It should be safe to
 use swsusp on ext3/reiserfs these days.]
