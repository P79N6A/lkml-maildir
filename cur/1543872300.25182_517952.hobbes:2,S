yes now lets take 2 dest machines , source ip is fixed , source port (2^16 - 1)
destip is fixed (a.a.a.a and b.b.b.b) ,dest port(2^16 -1) each ,
for a connection we have one port used , say connection 1 is
source ip,port 1 , a.a.a.a port 1
source ip,port 2 , a.a.a.a port 2
.
.
.
source ip,port 65535 , a.a.a.a port 65535
so total of 65535 connections (assume traffic is still going on, a
movie on a slow line dialup or 1kbps )
now if i try to open another connection (assume lots of file
descriptors are present) to a.a.a.a what happens
to b.b.b.b what happens
i think both will not get established as the OS doesn't have any free
source ports or am i wrong
