Since that's a matter of taste I can't disagree. The point was that the 
original post used
   *(a ? &b : &c) = d;
which generates either warnings or errors if b or c is a register 
variable, because you are not allowed to take the address of a register. 
It seems gcc does it anyway by intuiting what you mean, but it's not 
portable in the sense of being error-free code.
It was a nit, I didn't mean to start a controversy, although if "d" is 
actually a complex expression it is certainly less typing as I showed 
it, and prevents a future maintainer from changing one RHS and not the 
other. That's defensive programming.
