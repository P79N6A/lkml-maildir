I doubt about your last 'sprintf'. Your 'buf' just has only two 'u8's,
which maybe only has two bytes, and '\n' already consumes one. So only
one byte is left for the decimal vaule of 'manual'. Even it is just
less than 10, just as what you want, the final '\0' is omitted!
What's more, you can't get such information from the return value of
'sprintf'. So I suggest you to choose 'snprintf' instead.
