I'm seeing the same thing here between rc2-git6 and rc2-mm2 on intel
945-based hardware and similar.   (rc2-git6 WORKS, rc2-mm2 FAILS)
rc2-git6: for the most part works fine.
rc2-mm2: Restart works - shutdown freezes.
these units otherwise work almost completely: C3 mode doesn't work but
C4 DOES (ACPI sleep if I remember names correctly).
I did not test -git7 (or later).   I could if that would help.
