But the condition doesn't line up with the code:
	if (veryverylengthycondition1 &&
	    smallcond2 &&
	    (conditionnumber3a ||
	     condition3b)) {
		this_is_some_code();
		this_is_some_more_code();
	}
Personally, for complicated conditions like this, I prefer:
	if (veryverylengthycondition1 &&
	    smallcond2 &&
	    (conditionnumber3a ||
	     condition3b)
	    ) {
		this_is_some_code();
		this_is_some_more_code();
	}
But that seems to offend Andrew for some reason (or was it Christoph? or
both?).
