Can't you just use the Suspend button? :)
I'd be inclined to initiate suspend-to-disk when the laptop's lid is
closed, or when I press the suspend button if ACPI would be so
accomodating.  After closing the lid, if I change my mind there's only
two inputs I can do quickly: press the Suspend button, or open the
lid.  SysRq-Escape would take a couple of seconds longer due to
needing to open the lid.
Of those, I'd be worried about the fragile lid switch occasionally
bouncing as I moved the laptop, causing it to fail to suspend in my
bag.  The button is well protected.
