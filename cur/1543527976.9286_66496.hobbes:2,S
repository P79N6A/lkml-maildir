2.0.x is alpha software and should not be used.
(Yes, I know a lot of people do and that causes big problems for
upgrading: eg. 2.0.7pre6 is totally incompatible with 2.0.6.).

I guess that you should do:
#include <fpu_control.h>
and then use _FPU_GETCW and _FPU_SETCW macros.
more /usr/include/fpu_control.h.
All this is undocumented though (as well as necessary options for
ld-linux.so.2). IMHO there's a problem with glibc documentation. Hopefully
it gets/is better with 2.1.
And btw, this is not a kernel issue 8-)
