You're quite right. Module insertion is linking. And distributing a
kernel with binary-only modules already inserted would be a GPL
violation. What modules do is let people do the link at the last stage
-- the end user. The GPL does not restrict what end-users do with your
code if it doesn't involve redistribution.
In short: Copyright holders have the right to attempt to restrict their
interfaces. But end-users also have the right to ignore those attempts.
That is, unless the DMCA comes into play.
