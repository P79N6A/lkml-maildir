No, the network permission checks are intentionally layered to match the
network protocol implementation.  There is a process-to-socket check
performed in process context when the data is received from the socket
by an actual process, but there is also the socket-to-netif/node/port
check performed in softirq context when the packet is received on the
socket from the network.
