I'm not sure what that means.  I'm not confident that all relevant locking
code is always in one file.  If you mean that you did as I said, checked
every use of siglock and confirmed that tasklist_lock is held before
examining ->sighand, then we are good.

I don't see how that works at all.  The thought that it would seems to
contradict what we've just been discussing.  Holding tasklist_lock is what
protects against ->sighand and ->signal changing and the old pointers
becoming stale, not task_lock.  What am I missing here?
Thanks,
Roland
