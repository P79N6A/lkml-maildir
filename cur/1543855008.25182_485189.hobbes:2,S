ahhh, I believe I see the problem now. Please try out the following patch.
====
find_min_pfn_for_node() and find_min_pfn_with_active_regions() both depend
on a sorted early_node_map[]. However, sort_node_map() is being called after
fin_min_pfn_with_active_regions() in free_area_init_nodes(). In most cases,
this is ok, but on at least one x86_64, the SRAT table caused the E820 ranges
to be registered out of order. This gave the wrong values for the min PFN
range resulting in some pages not being initialised.
This patch sorts the early_node_map in find_min_pfn_for_node(). It has
been boot tested on x86, x86_64, ppc64 and ia64.
