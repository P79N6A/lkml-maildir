I have just setup a new server from Redhat 6.0. I set up a Raid 1 device
no problem except that it would load during boot up so I had to create my
own init scripts. However, I then upgraded to 2.2.10 and I get the
following message when I run raidstart:
/dev/md0: Invalid argument
I expect that this might be something to do with the version of raid tools
I am using (Redhat6.0 standard RPM) or may be due to Redhat using some
non-standard Raid stuff in the original 2.2.5-10 kernel. I did see that
Redhat had a hugh Raid patch in the kernel SRPM. Can anyone shed any light
on this for me. I am sure that many other people have had similar problems
with raid on RH6.
Help appreciated,
Abdul-Wahid
