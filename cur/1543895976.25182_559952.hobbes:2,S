With that said; Debian makes it easy to selectively install testing  
or unstable packages by adding "testing" or "unstable" to your  
sources.list and putting this in /etc/apt/apt.conf:
   APT::Default-Release "stable";
Then all apt-based programs will prefer stable packages everywhere  
possible.  If you explicitly run "apt-get install somepackage/ 
testing", then it will install the testing version of that package  
and continue to auto-upgrade it as testing receives updates.
Alternatively, you can "man apt_preferences" and tweak your "/etc/apt/ 
preferences" file to your heart's content.  This includes things like  
"Forcibly downgrade packages to the 'local' version if found in my  
local deb repo", "Prefer stable over testing and unstable", etc.
Cheers,
