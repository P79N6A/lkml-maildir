Recently, the web-app at the company I work for started having problems load 
balancing.  This was traced back to a large number of tcp-resets being sent 
from the web servers to the clients.
Here's netstat output for one of the boxen:
    437761 active connections openings
    0 passive connection openings
    21 failed connection attempts
    0 connection resets received
    101 connections established
    140497907 segments received
    149967684 segments send out
    116610 segments retransmited
    111 bad segments received.
    1003306 resets sent
This box is running an apache/tomcat/jboss setup serving both HTTP and RMI 
requests.  The reset packets disrupt the load balancing method, as the load 
balancers think the reset means the connection can now be round-robined to the 
next machine.  This can be masked by using cookie-based balancing, but I am 
worried that we would be masking a problem.
Documentation concerning tuning buffers for network purposes say that 2.4 is 
good at auto-tuning, and that only /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem|tcp_rmem might 
need tweaking.
The kernel is 2.4.9-31smp from RedHat 7.2.  The cards are Intel 82557's.  There 
are two interfaces, with 1 for client access and 1 used for communication with 
the backend database.  (The ->client is the one we are worried about).
Any ideas on why the interfaces would be doing this?  The boxes served 1.6 
hits/sec average over last month for a total of about 10Gb.  Is there some 
tuning that needs to take place?
Thanks in advance.
