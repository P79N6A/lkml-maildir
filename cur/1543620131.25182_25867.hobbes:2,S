Then find a better way to catch errant uses of dma64_addr_t.  I have
spent too much time discussing the DMA API with Dave M to see it being
misused for no good reason.  It will take some time until there are
enough sample drivers that show proper usage of the DMA interface.
There is almost no driver that needs dma64_addr_t.  We can add it
once there is an ia64 driver that *really* needs it.

Christoph, if you want this type your linux distro, you can add it
with your own patch.  For the time being, I'm the ia64 linux
maintainer so I hope you can respect my decisions.
