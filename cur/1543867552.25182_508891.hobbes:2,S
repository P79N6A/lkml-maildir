well, the situation for external modules is no worse than usual.
They still work, they just aren't signed. Which from a distributor point
of view, is actually a nice thing, as they stick out like a sore thumb
in oops reports with (U) markers :)

external modules still compile, and run just fine. The signed modules code
doesn't prevent loading of them unless the user decides to do so with
a special boot option (which is no different really than say, reducing
the cap-bound sysctl to prevent module loading).
