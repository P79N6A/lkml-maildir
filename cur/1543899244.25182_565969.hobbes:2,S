OK, thanks for checking it, guys.
Yoann, the "tree wide" thing really is a problem.  Your patch here is
touching ten or more maintainers' code and it really does want to be split
into ten separate patches and fed into the tree via the appropriate routes.
I can take care of that routing if I have the ten patches, but this time I
really can't be bothered splitting the patch up (it's rather boring, and
gets error-prone).
For this patch, I tossed out the ten or so hunks which conflicted with
other pending patches in the various trees and I shall just grit the teeth
and maintain and merge it as a single whopping patch.  (At least this way
I'll actually get some scsi stuff merged).  Anything which conflicts with
anyone's outstanding work will be dropped.
For any future patches, _please_ split them up along some sane lines. 
Generally you'll find that one patch per second-level directory works
pretty well: drivers/net, drivers/scsi, drivers/usb, fs/ext2, drivers/char,
etc.
Thanks.
