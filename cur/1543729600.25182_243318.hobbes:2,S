Well, now that my Powerstack II boots 2.6 again, I'm missing the
additional memory - I now have 192M and it only detects 32M :)
Tis is not very urgent though, there are other problems with this
machine before it's production quality with 2.6 - like tulip (and now
maybe also a usb uhci hcd) hanging. I'll try to narrow these down too.
