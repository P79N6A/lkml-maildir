This may be a different reason than the vendor default or the saved
setting being WCE = 0, Queue Algorithm Modifier = 0...
I would really appreciate if the kernel printed a warning for every
partition mounted that cannot both enforce write order and guarantee
synchronous completion for f(data)sync, based on the drive's write
cache, file system type, current write barrier support and all that.

Right, synchronous completion is the other issue. I want the kernel to
tell me if it's capable of doing that on a particular partition (given
hardware settings WRT cache, drivers, file system, and all that). Either
in the docs or if it's too confusing via dmesg.
