The architects have spoken, and we're getting a capability flag for this. 
I'll repost my patch with new autodetection code that doesn't involve 
checking the processor version.

As I pointed out in my earlier mail, there's still an issue with 
map_phys_fmr possibly sleeping. Let's keep the irqsave for the time being 
and revisit this part once we find a solution to map_phys_fmr.
