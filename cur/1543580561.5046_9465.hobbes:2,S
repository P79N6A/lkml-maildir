Subject: CVS ld breaks in arch/i386/boot/Makefile

This is just a warning to those of you who
(are so foolhardy as to:-)) use CVS binutils to build
the linux kernel. The current CVS ld requires that
the option
 ld ... -oformat binary ...
now be written as
 ld ... --oformat binary ...
Note the two dashes.
This breakage occurs in arch/i386/boot/Makefile
[From the maintainers: this is necessary to avoid confusion
with other options like  -o format]
