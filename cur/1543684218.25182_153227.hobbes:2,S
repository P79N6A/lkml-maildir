If you are going to talk special hardware i'd suggest making
it a USB device instead of a PCI card.
Most systems manufactured in the last five years or so ago
have USB but laptops don't and many servers don't have a
spare PCI slot.  There is enough power specified by the
standard to make it a passive device in most cases.  If you
want you could use a cable long enough to mount the display
on the wall outside the wiring closet or server room.
Sounds fun so have some.
