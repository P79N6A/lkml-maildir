I wonder what are the technical merits of this change. I certainly agree
with Pat's assertion that the rest of driver model functions should be used
by in-kernel subsystems (such as PCI, USB, serio etc) only and not exposed
to the outside world. This will allow freely fix/enhance the core without
fear of silently breaking external modules.
But class_simple is itself a limited and contained interface with well-
defined semantic. Which I believe was advertised aat one time as a wrapper
for the objects wanting to plug into hotplug/udev model but either living
outside of established subsystems or within subsystem not yet ready to
implement proper refcounting needed for full-blown sysfs integration.
I think it is a mistake to convert class_simple into GPL-only export.
