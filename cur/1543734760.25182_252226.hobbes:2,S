Ah, well, I dont care about various vendors. I only care about Linux, 
BSD and SunOS kernel behaviour ;)
That said, TCP-MD5 signature renders this mostly moot, and deployment 
of TCP-MD5 has increased a lot since the last round of "BGP TCP is 
insecure!" non-issues came up. Many IXes and peers now require 
TCP-MD5.
The rights and wrongs of TCP-MD5 notwithstanding, it'd be nice if 
Linux could support this. Anyone running BGP on Linux at moment must 
patch their kernel - or else just switch to Free/Open BSD.
