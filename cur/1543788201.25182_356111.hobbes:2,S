With all due respect (and I do believe some is due); your comment
above makes no sense. Operating system designers design software to
operate on existing systems -- often doing as much as possible to
ensure that the design supports lots of different systems. However, _a
neccessary prerequisite_ for that activity is "hardware dropping into
their laps." You warn that "the hardware design decisions will have
already been made by someone else;" but that is the order in which it
_neccessarily_ works! What hardware designer out there spends his day
looking around for as-yet-unused (and hence untested) operating
systems that run on some hypothetical yet-to-be-designed hardware and
say to themselves, "ah, that looks nice -- I think I can design some
hardware that will run that software _really well_?"
Your argument defies logic, and it's that fact -- not your intentions
-- that makes this thread so tiresome.
