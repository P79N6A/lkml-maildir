Dear diary,
   after trying the Linux kernel 2.5.52, I recognized the following problems:
      - modules are named .ko instead of .o, is there a need for new modutils ?
        Didn't find anything until now in the Changelogs.
        A `cp find /lib/modules/2.5.52/kernel -name \*.o /lib/mo*/2.5.52/`
        let's RR module-init utils load the modules again.
      - inserting of orinoco_cs freezes the system [automaticly by cardmgr]
      - speedstep.o still does not support all P3s ?
   cpufreq: Intel(R) SpeedStep(TM) for this chipset not (yet) available.
         Do you need some more informations about this chip?
      - apm doesn't recognize when I close my notebook nor does it 
        recognize Fn+F4 [suspend button]; Calling apm -s still does work
      - inserting apm.o causes kernel to printout the following:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address d8824000
 printing eip:
d8824000
