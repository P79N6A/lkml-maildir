That doesn't make any sense to me, any more than
adding a per-clock flag would.

... e.g. by CONFIG_REGULATOR_DISABLE_UNUSED being explicitly
set, indicating that the regulator support for that platform
(and its drivers) is complete enough that it can safely paper
over such early init issues.

Why not, though?  That works well with clocks, once the
drivers are debugged.  Having dozens of fiddly little knobs
is not an advantage.

The "boot_on" flag seems redundant with given "always_on"; as
a rule you can *tell* if the bootloader enabled a supply, so
the issue is more like whether it should stay on, even when no
driver wants it on.  Especially considering that bootloaders
seldom guarantee to enable only a minimal set of supplies.
See the appended patch.

=========== CUT HERE
From: David Brownell <dbrownell@users.sourceforge.net>
Let the regulator framework disable regulators that have wrongly
been left enabled.  In the same manner as various implementations
of the clock framework, this is done by a late_initcall after all
drivers have had a chance to say what should be enabled.
