Also, what you snipped was another issue, not addressed by the patch.
Some architectures test if the setting up of the signal handler stack
frame succeeded, and others don't.  I believe that this may be a
problem, since it was recently fixed on the x86, and probably should be
addressed on the architectures that don't check for failure.
