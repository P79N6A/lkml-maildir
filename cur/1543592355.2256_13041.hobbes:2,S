Something I have noticed with netscape is that if the X server is
killed out from under it (user logout, or kill X11 manually) is that
it continues to run. The process appears to be looping around select
and attempting to reconnect to the (now dead) X server, and not exiting
like it should.
Other times it seems to terminate properly. The problem may exhibit itself
if netscape is waiting for some asynchronous event (like the name service
lookup maybe) and misses the/a signal that it's socket to the X server
has failed. If a kill -15 doesn't terminate the rogue netscape, then it
takes a kill -9 . In my expierence it is in a tight loop, and ignoring
normal user input. It could still be expanding memory consumption...
