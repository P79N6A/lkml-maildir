Yes.

But you'd need to also worry about previous mappings of that page. wouldn't that require a fairly exhaustive scan of who has the physical memory mapped?
Not in 2.5 - it has the new RMAP vm with backlinks from struct page to ptes.
I already used that in a new machine check handler that has similar requirements.

That would be a bit ugly, but possible if there is no better way.

You have to walk the rmap chains and change the ptes, or return -EINVAL.
(e.g. you could define the API that only transition from writeback to other mappings
is allowed or reversal) 
The locking of this is a bit tricky however.

One of them has to lose. Or use the EINVAL method above.

The problem is that the frame buffer and the agp aperture normally have no struct page,
so you need to find a different way to store the shared state for them (e.g. a new
rbtree)

In 2.4 there isn't, unless you run a RMAP kernel.
In 2.5 it's easy.
