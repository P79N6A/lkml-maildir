Right and it would be a cleanup not to touch __BOOT_DS.  We have
already reloaded it in  arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S anyway.

Nope.  On other architectures where the bootloader has access to
vmlinux this works just fine, all dynamic factors can be contained in
the bss.  We don't go very long before we reserve memory after all.
It is only on x86 where there is not enough information that it is
problematic. 
Putting the ramdisk right after the kernel (text + data + bss) is the
"most correct" position.  Anything else is likely to break when the
firmware changes.  This has already happened 2 or 3 times on x86.
When putting the ramdisk right after the kernel if anything breaks you
will notice it immediately, and the kernel will be fixed.
If I truly put an initrd at the top of memory the kernel would not
even be able to read the ramdisk.
