I thought it was not at all unusual to miss a jiffy here or there due to interrupt
locking/latency; plus jiffies is expressed with respect to the value of HZ so you
would need to do some deviding in there somewhere.
Where HZ has been adjusted up, or on slower embedded boxes where interrupts could be
blocked longer, you would lose time.
Or are you not talking about real-word time?
