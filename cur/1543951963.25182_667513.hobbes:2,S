That's what I was getting at. When the next feature comes along
are we going to stuff it into capabilities, too? Maybe we'll
cram it into audit or CIPSO instead, but how long can this go on?
Eventually we need a mechanism that allows more or less general
mix-and-match, maybe with a few rules like "don't mix plaids and
stripes" to keep things sane or these lesser facilities have no
chance. Seems like we're still making LSM too hard to use.
Unless I take an aggressive approach to adding them to Smack.
Hmm, might be a way to make a buck or two that way.
(Only kidding)(Well, mostly only kidding)
And yes, I understand that there are still those about who
don't like LSM in any form, much less in a useful one.
