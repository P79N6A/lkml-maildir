I think we leave it the way it is because 64-bit divides are slow.
It is very easy to go accidentally adding 64-bit divides.  Say, by changing
the disk indexing to use 64-bit sector numbers as we did earlier in 2.5.
By requiring an explicit do_div we are made aware of all those 64-bit
divides and are made to think about them.
Why 64-bit divides in particular were victimised in this manner is a matter
for speculation ;)
