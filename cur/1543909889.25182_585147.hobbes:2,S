Hello All
           I have searched for Maintainers List to get the correct
Maintainer for my patch. But i am not getting exact maintainer to
which i should forward my patch. Will any body please tell me,to which
maintainer i should forward my patch for its inclusion?
Summery of the Patch:
This patch Warns the administrator about the fork bombing attack
(whenever any user is crossing its process limit). I have used
printk_ratelimit function in this patch. This function helps to
prevent flooding of syslog and prints message as per the values set by
root user in following files:-
1) /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit:- This file contains value for,
how many times message should be printed in syslog.
2) /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit_burst: - This file contains value
for, after how much time message should be repeated.
This patch is really helpful for administrator/root user from security
point of view. They can take action against attacker by looking at
syslog messages related with fork bombing attack.
Added comments will definitely help developers.
