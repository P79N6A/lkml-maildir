That doesn't solve the fundamental problem.
You would still have to be able to tell a remote server that some locks
which previously belonged to one owner are being reallocated to several
owners. That is not something that NFS, CIFS, AFS,... support, and I'd
be surprised if any of the clustered filesystems support it either.
