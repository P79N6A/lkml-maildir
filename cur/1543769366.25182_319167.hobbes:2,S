Subject: linux.bkbits.net question: mapping cset to kernel version?

Given a particular file and a particular bitkeeper revision for the file, how can I tell 
which version of the kernel incorporated that changeset?
In particular, I want to know about revision 1.65 of mm/rmap.c, which can be seen at 
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/diffs/mm/rmap.c@1.65?nav=index.html
|src/|src/mm|hist/mm/rmap.c
I want to know what the first version of Linux is to incorporate that change.
And please don't tell me to do a diff on all the 2.6 versions, because that's not efficient.
