I don't have a copy of the standard handy, but google shows this snippet on
the info-minux mailing list:
   From ANSI X3.159-1989 3.2.2.3:
      An integral constant expression with the value 0, or such an expression
      cast to the type void *, is called a null pointer constant. If a null
      pointer constant is assigned to or compared for equality to a pointer,
      the constant is converted to a pointer of that type.

Your prerogative.
