Well, we do have such a monotonic time sequence already, and that's the
one that the kernel always uses internally.
It's called "jiffies64".
However, "jiffies" are not really real time, they are only a "reasonable
abstraction thereof", and while they imply ordering ("time_after()" works
fine inside the kernel), they do _not_ imply real time.
In other words, there is no way to move from time -> jiffies and back.
But we could certainly export jiffies64 as a "nanosecond-like" thing. All
it takes is one 32x64-bit multiply. It won't be "true nanoseconds", but it
will be a "reasonable approximation" (ie the rate may be off by several
percentage points, since nothing is correcting for it. But the "no
correction" is part of the _advantage_ too).
