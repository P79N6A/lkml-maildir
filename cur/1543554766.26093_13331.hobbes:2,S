Jah, Bummer from my side; use "|0x20" instead. But as discussed, isalnum()
does the perfect job, for readability and efficiency.

Hmm, haf-a-amiley. Are module names to be localized or are they considered
"international code" like the sources, limiting them to 7-Bit ASCII.
What's your opinion, Alan ? Linus ?
I'd consider it "system internal", not visible to the user and hence 7-Bit
must suffice. I also strongly agree with Keith: treating strings that come
from the kernel as tainted is weird at least.
I suggest to stick with [A-Za-z0-9_-]*, adding a check for the first char not
being '-', maybe modifying devfs do use dashes ("dev-") and auditing the rest
of the kernel BTW. The M$-FSes look a little suspicious to me with their
"nls_*" stuff. CAP_SYS_MOUNT (once established) might then be turned into
CAP_SYS_MODULE this way (mount -t vfat -o conv="; chmod ...") ???
Keith: what about the good-ole' "--" to specify end-of-options ? Every word
after that could be treated as a simple module name.
