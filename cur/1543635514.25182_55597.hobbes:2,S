HZ is used in a LOT of places.  I suspect "tweaking" at run
time would be a bit difficult.  
The high-res-timers patch give high resolution timers with
out changing HZ.  Interrupts are scheculed as needed,
between the 1/HZ ticks, so a quite system will have few (if
any) interrupts between the ticks.
