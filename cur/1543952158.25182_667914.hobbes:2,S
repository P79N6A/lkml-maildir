Subject: [PATCH] Remove superfluous include of string.h from percpu.h.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/15/24

There's nothing in percpu.h that requires an explicit inclusion of
string.h.

  after how hideously i embarrassed myself with that earlier exchange,
i am by god going to get a patch out of this.  :-)
  compile-tested on x86 after "make allyesconfig", so that deletion
did not appear to cause any breakage anywhere in the tree.
  p.s.  for the [PATCH] subject line, what kernel subsystem would be
used for things like the header files?
