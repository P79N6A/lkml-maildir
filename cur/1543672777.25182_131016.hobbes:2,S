Why not just change the names? The current setup clearly is confusing, and
adding defines doesn't much help. Rename the structure member so that the
name says what it is, aka "address_mode", and when renaming it you'd go
through the source anyway and change "!addressing" to something more
readable like "address_mode == IDE_LBA48" or whatever.
(Anyway, I'll just drop all the 48-bit patches for now, since you've 
totally confused me about which ones are right and what the bugs are ;)
