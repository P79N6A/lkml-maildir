I helped bring up the first instance of ZFS running as a kernel module
on Halloween, 2002 (one fun week staying up all night hacking with
Jeff Bonwick).  The earliest code was written in either 2001 or just
possibly 2000 - so 5-6 years in elapsed time.  On the other hand, in
terms of total programmer staff-years put into ZFS, it's on the order
of 25 years.
I'm not sure either what the best route to the next big Linux file
system is - start from scratch or reuse a lot of code.  One of the
things I want to talk about at the workshop is creative reuse of
existing code, a la the continuation inode idea.
