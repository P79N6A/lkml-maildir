please add a .config option dependent on CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y [and 
default-disabled] that auto-tests suspend/resume functionality 60 
seconds after hitting user-space (the suspend/resume cycle kept small 
via a small RTC timeout) and s2ram correctness will be tested _a lot_ 
more.
(it doesnt matter if graphics does not resume fine - at least for my 
tests)
kprobes had similar problems and it now has a few simple smoke-tests - 
which i just saw trigger on a patch that i did not notice would break 
kprobes. I think this should be done for all functionality that is not 
regularly triggered by a normal distro bootup (and which is easy to 
overlook in testing).
