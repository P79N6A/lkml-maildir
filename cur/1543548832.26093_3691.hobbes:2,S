The way they took this was that we had changed sides in the war, since I
was perceived to be approaching them with you.  Here's what they said
about you,
"... We are concernd about the veracity of your associates.  Despite the
representations they have made to you, we have not been taking GPL code
from Linux and using internally at Microsoft.  This approach by these
Linux people is little more than an attempt to [blackmail Microsoft]
with unsubstanciated rumors.  We see no benefit whatsoever to provided
NTFS R/W capabilities on Linux ..."  
Not very nice to be sure.  I know that black and white markings (like a
penguin) are in style right now, but white and black stripes are not !

I have the ability to litigate against them.  They know this and I doubt
will go any further than to bluster and threaten.
