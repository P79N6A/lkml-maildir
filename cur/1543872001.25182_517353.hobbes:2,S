I don't understand why interrupt latency suffers.  Sure, the interrupt 
that's being masked is delayed, but on the other hand the interrupt 
that's doing the masking is not.  We're moving the latency from the 
first interrupt to the second, probably with a slight gain in overall 
throughput.
It *does* matter if the interrupts have meaningful priorities.  Is that 
the case here?
