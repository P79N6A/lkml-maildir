   In order to compile ARM Linux, you will need a compiler capable of
-  generating ARM ELF code with GNU extensions.  GCC 2.95.1, EGCS
-  1.1.2, and GCC 3.3 are known to be good compilers.  Fortunately, you
-  needn't guess.  The kernel will report an error if your compiler is
-  a recognized offender.
