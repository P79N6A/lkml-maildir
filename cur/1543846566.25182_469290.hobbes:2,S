Ah, interesting.  I'd been looking for it, and, yep, completely 
undocumented.  It even generates the right instruction on x86.  
Unfortunately, your asm sequence isn't correct, since there's no 
guarantee that the asm and the builtin_trap will be adjacent (though its 
hard to see what might be interposed in this case, since it would be 
dead code).  If only gcc labels-as-values worked properly...

Hm, not really.  Well, it can be an arch-by-arch decision.
