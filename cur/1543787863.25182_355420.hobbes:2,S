Well, overall what needs to happen for newly-plugged-in devices is the a 
re-run of the probe sequence.  The flags should certainly be reset to a 
default value, the same value that the device would see had it been 
plugged in when the driver loaded:  ata_bus_probe() call sequence, after 
initialization from ata_host_init().  This may require saving a few 
pieces of data, as you have done, agreed.
