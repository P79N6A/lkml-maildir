Ahh.  Well, this is definately one of those cases where you don't want to
use vmalloc.  In fact, don't even use the sysv code as a starting point
since it's a mess.  We've discussed a few different ways of doing this on
linux-mm a while back (archieves on ftp.kvack.org/pub/archives/linux-mm/),
but I think the best way to handle it is along the lines of what Eric did
for his shmfs: provide a set of inode operations to back the vma.  That
way, all the duplication of (sometimes trick) mm code is eliminated.  Eric
had a rather complete filesystem, but it was broken when the page cache
code was changed.  Nevertheless, it's a good starting point.
