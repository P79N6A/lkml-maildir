   Dave: Anton suggested you might have a justification for
   __cacheline_aligned doing something on UP?
   I think I'd prefer __cacheline_aligned to be the same as
   __cacheline_aligned_in_smp, and have a new __cacheline_aligned_always
   for those who REALLY want it (if any).
I think things like oprofile_buffer really want it always.
   -struct tcp_hashinfo __cacheline_aligned tcp_hashinfo = {
   +struct tcp_hashinfo __cacheline_aligned_in_smp tcp_hashinfo = {
This definitely too.
All of the submembers are placed at cacheline boundaries, which
helps even on UP.  If I meant cacheline aligned on SMP I would
have used the corresponding macro :)
