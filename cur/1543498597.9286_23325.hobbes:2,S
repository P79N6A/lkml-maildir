	I think... have a anyway to make the khttpd a port-tunnel?? like:
port[80]--[webserver]
when i run insmod khttp:
port[80]--[(80)khttpd]--[(80)webserver(apache)]
and ( dreamming more!)
run insmod khttp-module-perl
port[80] ---[(80)khttpd + perlmodule]---[(80)webserver]
All response in 80 port...
but khttpd run like a tunnel or filter betwen real port and webserver...
thats possible?
T+ (regards)
