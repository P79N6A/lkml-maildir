The Cisco PIX is gratuitously clearing the TCP window scaling bits.  So if you
have tcp_adv_win_scale set to (for example) 6, you'll send a window advertisement
of (say) 4096, represented as 64 and a "shift left 6 bits".  The PIX whacks the
"6 bits" part, and the other end thinks the window is 64 bytes and wedges when
a response is over 64 bytes long.
There was quite a discussion of this on lkml back last July.
