Note that some classes of CPU bugs happen exactly _because_ of CPU
shutdown for power management. If something in the CPU is not fully
static, being _idle_ can be the thing that corrupts it..

In addition to disabling the MTRR code, I would suggest disabling this
code too:

but it does not have a config option, so you'll actually have to disable
the code by hand in include/asm-i386/bugs.h (just search for 'coma bug').
