  Thanks for writing the support. I was already wondering whether someone
would submit the patch for inclusion ;).  There's no real UDF maintainer.
I'm probably closest to the one, trying to fix reported bugs when I have
time... Also Marcin Slusarz has done some cleanup work recently (his
patches are in -mm kernel and will go into mainline kernel soon - probably
into 2.6.25 - I'm afraid you'll have to rediff your patch against his
patches).
  Anyway, for submitting a patch, you can use guidelines in
Documentation/SubmittingPatches. Especially, your patch has to have some
description and Signed-off-by line. I can then review the patch when you
submit it.
  BTW: I've just quickly browsed through the patch and I don't quite get
why have you commented out UDF_SB_SESSION() in udf_read_tagged(). Also even
if it really shouldn't be there, then just delete it...
