However, for folks like me who develop mainly on the 2.4 kernel this
is a real blessing, and I hope Paul continues to maintain this.

Oh, I've got 3.79.1, there ya go, I guess that's why it works.  Thanks
once again, debian gnomes.  Anyway, there's not a lot to fear since
the patch has no apparent ill effect on the operation of old kbuild.
I'm not advocating that Marcelo merge it just yet, no rush.  It
obviously needs to mature in 2.5 first.
