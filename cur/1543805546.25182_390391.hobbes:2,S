Linus is posturing. I can go back to numerous previous versions when he 
and stallman were "buddy buddy" and the language was open
and said "any later version". Well, here's the gotcha. Any version 
released before Linus said this is GPL 2, 3 or later. As of today, all new
versions are GPLv2. That's how the law works. So 2.6.15 forward is GPLv2 
only. Linus cannot re-release previous Linux versions after he
already posted this NOTICE in COPYING, which he did and left the 
language pen like this. So it's up to the recevier of the code whether
its GPLv2 or GPLv3 or whatever, but those releases which appeared with 
COPYING stating this language are whatever GPL license you
want.
