This is a debugging trap which basically means that the background bdflush
sweep found a buffer on the kernel's dirty buffer list which had an active 
transaction against it (which means that the buffer should have been on 
the protected, journal list). 
Was there anything odd prior to this happening?  Anything in the logs?
The fact that the fs was remounted with errors suggests that something
else had gone wrong before this (the oops above would not cause the fs
to be marked with errors).  
Finally, are you running anything that touches buffers directly on this
disk, or were you doing any heavy delete operations?  I have just found a
locking bug: journal_forget() does not take the journal lock, so that
could well explain the problem if you were deleting data at the time.
I'll release a 0.0.2d for 2.2.15 with that fix in place once I've stress
tested things a bit more thoroughly.
Cheers,
 Stephen
