But do you think it's safe to design aes driver that could work only
with one kernel user and to rely on administrator config to verify
this condition ?
BTW, here are figures I got with 2 different versions of the driver
when using tcrypt module. The second being the result with the
optimized driver (no key reloading on each block):
normal version:
test 4 (128 bit key, 8192 byte blocks): 1 operation in 67991 cycles (8192 bytes)
optimized version:
test 4 (128 bit key, 8192 byte blocks): 1 operation in 51783 cycles (8192 bytes)
So the gain is 16000 cycles which seems to worth the change, isn't it ?
thanks
