I have systems (HP DL145) with
    PCI bridge: nVidia Corporation CK804 PCIE Bridge (rev a3)
and MSI-X works fine for me with Mellanox PCIe adapters (with no
quirks or anything -- the BIOS enables it by default):
    $ grep MSI-X /proc/interrupts
     66:     205792          0          0          0       PCI-MSI-X ib_mthca (comp)
     74:          1          0          0          0       PCI-MSI-X ib_mthca (async)
