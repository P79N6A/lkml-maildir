The real problem here - again IMHO - is the complete lack of more-or-less
standard boot sequence.  Every distro invents their own intramfs with
unique recognized command-line arguments.
And kinit/klibc doesn't really help here, because it's too low-level.

P.S.  I wonder why certain emails are duplicated on LKML.  An example
is my previous email in this thread - I received two copies of it
from linux-kernel-owner@vger.
