Hi Meelis.

I think the mistake here is one of grammer rather than anything else,
so would suggest the following rewrite of the above:
 Q> Older versions of sysklogd sometimes segfault under 2.2 kernels.
 Q> Upgrading to the latest release fixes that problem, as would
 Q> adding support for new features like system power-off on halt
 Q> (with appropriate incantations of halt; see the man page) and
 Q> automatic decoding of kernel oopses.
See how long it takes you to spot the difference...
Best wishes from Riley.
