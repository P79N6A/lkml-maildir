LFS fragments data by design ... it can't write to already allocated 
space, so if you write to the middle of LFS directory, it will allocate 
new block, new indirect pointers to that directory, new block in inode 
table etc.
The same fragmentation with files (although with files it could be fixed 
by not relying on consistecny of their content).
