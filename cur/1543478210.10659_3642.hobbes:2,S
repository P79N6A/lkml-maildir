Subject: [BUG]: NFS renders server useless...?

There appears to be some sort of problem I'm experienceing with 2.0.36 (and
probably 2.2 and on, this problem was reported in 2.0.33 but was not
fixed...) where a busy NFS client will begin displaying the following
messages once in a while with no apparent trigger:
Jan 15 04:00:20 server kernel: RPC: rpc_doio sending evil packet:
Jan 15 04:00:20 server kernel:      e703045b 01000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 7a000801
Shortly thereafter the machine will be mysteriously out of resources, and
basicly no new processes may be created, and noone will be able to log in.
This is killing a very critical server at our site every day now. I've
searched through the archives and found that people have had this problem
with 2.0.33 and earlier. I thought it would be fixed by now but it hasn't.
Does anyone know of a fix for this, or when it will be fixed?
Thanks
-Steve
