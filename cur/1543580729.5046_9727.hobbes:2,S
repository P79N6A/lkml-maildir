After reading up some code, FreeBSD does do a bind() check which is
just as restrictive as Linux's except that they allow INADDR_ANY
combinations when the credentials of the user doing the bind() match
the credentials of all other sockets bound to that port.
I don't think we should change our behavior.  Allowing the combination
in question only when the UIDs match between the socket owners is
dubious at best.
I actually went to the FreeBSD code because what Steven's showed
was extremely loose in what it let through.  It allowed the nfs
port override trick Alan mentioned.
