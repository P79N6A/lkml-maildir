On shutdown -h, I see the stack trace below before power
off.  This is a Dell Poweredge 4400 with two 900MHz cpus.
I know that in the past, combining SMP and APM has been a 
no-no -- don't know if that's what's going on.
I see this with 2.5.70-mm4, too, btw.  At least it's very
similar: starts with close and produces a sleeping function
warning.
