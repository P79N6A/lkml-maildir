OK, so two similar, but not identical cards using the same driver?
First patch mentioned looks very simple, but won't apply to 2.5.62
There's now just:
   static char ips_hot_plug_name[] = "ips";
   static int __devinit  ips_insert_device(struct pci_dev *pci_dev, const
struct pci_device_id *ent);
   static void __devexit ips_remove_device(struct pci_dev *pci_dev);
   struct pci_driver ips_pci_driver = {
       .name            = ips_hot_plug_name,
       .id_table        = ips_pci_table,
       .probe           = ips_insert_device,
       .remove          = __devexit_p(ips_remove_device),
   };
Second patch looks a little intimidating ... more like a full blown update
of the driver ... I'd rather not go there unless I really have to.
