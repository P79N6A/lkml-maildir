I know its not polite to quote private email but I think this is in
everyones interest. The problem is that there is only API documentation for
external developers - everything that is used to program the chip directly
has, so far, apparently been just included in the blueprints and
mathematical, theoretic chip development papers (which obviously cannot be
released).
Anyways, this is what J.Hawley(sp?) from Creative told me.

Creative is willing to provide programming information, but there simply
isn't any because it hasn't been written.  We have almost never given this
type of information out, instead we have exposed functionality through
API's (Windows centric).  So we have to work on writing the documents,
sample source code, etc.
...
It's not an NDA issue, the information is NOT usable.  We designed the chip
together, I was on the team that architected the chip.  The documentation
has details that need to be removed, such as theories of operation for the
logic blocks, formulas, algorithms.  None of this is programming
information.
I will have the stuff ready as soon as possible.  Stay tuned.

The software engineers looked over the shoulders of the VLSI team.

That should clear things up a little.
