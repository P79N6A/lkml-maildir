Could you at least apply this bit on top?  I actually combed select.c
yesterday and have a bunch of changes, but I can send those to you as a
patch series later.  This one I'd like to land now since it fixes a bug
introduced within the last week (even though the bug isn't currently
triggerable)
The code is (very slightly) rearranged; should be a little more readable
and quicker for the fastpath.
Subject: [SELECT] don't overflow if (SELECT_STACK_ALLOC % sizeof(long) != 0)
If SELECT_STACK_ALLOC is not a multiple of sizeof(long) then stack_fds[]
would be shorter than SELECT_STACK_ALLOC bytes and could overflow later
in the function.  Fixed by simply rearranging the test later to work on
sizeof(stack_fds)  Currently SELECT_STACK_ALLOC is 256 so this doesn't happen,
but it's nasty to have things like this hidden in the code.  What if later
someone decides to change SELECT_STACK_ALLOC to 300?
