I'm running 2.4.21-rc3 with the latest patch from ftp.x86-64.org:
prime:/usr/src# uname -r
2.4.21-rc3
The x86-64.org patch doesn't touch much outside of arch/x86_64.  You are
right that CONFIG_IDE_STROKE is off:
prime:/usr/src/linux# grep IDE .config | sort | tac  
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEFLOPPY=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
