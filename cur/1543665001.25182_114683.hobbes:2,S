It's probably not valid on Linux but on OSes that support the functionality
you use to implement it.  It might e.g. work on the Hurd that uses old
Linux networking code.

Checking for OSes is wrong because you couldn't care less for the

nice idea behind autoconf (the implementation of autoconf is a completly
different issue, though).
