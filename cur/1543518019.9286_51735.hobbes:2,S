Token Ring doesn't work that way, usually- it doesn't look as one big LAN.
It is usually configured as a source routed network, and that means that for
every network adapter on the network there is a "ring-bridge-ring"
association, the path that the initial "all routes explore" packet discovers
(up to a usual of 7 rings, 14 rings possible.)
In token ring, bridges tack on their id to the packet, or examine the packet
for the bridge number to determine what routing path it will take. Rather
nice, actually. It is the main pain with attaching Ethernet segments,
though, as the token ring packets need a ring termination number, what the
destination ring is supposed to be, where the Ethernet doesn't really. 
As a side note, it is possible to set up token ring as a transparently
bridged network, not requiring ring numbers, but that gets rid of the
advantages of SRB.

of course on different msau's (rings).

well, I read that the bridging code "make the lan's appear as if they were
1 big lan".
In yet another mini-howto I read: <<
A bridge should not have an IP address.  It CAN, but a plain bridge
     doesn't need one.
Once the system is back up, put the ethernet cards into promiscuous
     mode, so they will look at every packet that passes by its
     interface:
>> So is it possible to give ONE adapter an ip-adress but not the other?
sounds interesting.
I'll have to give it a try when I get some time ... maybe after christmas.
thanks so far.
