Er... I don't want to harp on the subject, but as I mentioned earlier, there's
a "\ No newline at end of file" in the patch block for arch/ppc/kernel/openpic.c
that gets introduced by later versions of diff, which causes problems for older
versions of patch (failing at that point with a malformed patch error).
If it's too much trouble, don't bother, but it'd be nice to have a patch that
applies cleanly on all my 2.2 boxes, without having to remember to fiddle with
it by hand... (OK, it's just an excuse to not upgrade patch :)
