It does not seams to be limited to braodcom cards. 3com and Intel e100
cards does the exact same stunt on kernels never than 2.6.8.1. Intel
e1000 and realtek 8139 cards do however work.

SMTP fixup is a dirty hack where the firewall limits the amount of
SMTP commands that can be used in the session to only the core rfc 821
commands. Most people do however use it just to hide the actual
receiving mail server from the sender - my guess is that the Cisco PIX
changes the frames/packages and then the connection gets dropped. I
got the admin to turn it off temporally and then the tg3 works just
fine.
