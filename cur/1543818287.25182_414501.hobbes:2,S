The last time I looked at it I thought it did something pretty simplistic
in that it just dumped any RT thread to another CPU but didn't do it in
a strict manner with regard to priority. Maybe that's changed or else I
didn't pay attention to it that as carefully as I thought.
As far as CPU binding goes, I'm wanting a method of getting around the
latency of the rt overload logic in certain cases at the expense of
rebalancing. That's what I ment by it.
