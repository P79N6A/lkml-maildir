The system was running fine for about a month, then over the last two days
the system began to die a slow death.  The frist two lockups I was not
around when it happened but this time I was on the system when it died.
It took about 5 minutes to get the output of PS and looking at that data ..
there were no processes out of control.   Nothing eating memory, and no
memory shortages.
vmstat was displaying that the system's cpu was eaten by the kernel...

It was like all the sudden someone caused the machine to have no resources,
but I can't find anything in userland that would cause the problems.
 11:19pm  up 13:56, 11 users,  load average: 6.42, 8.59, 11.39
233 processes: 227 sleeping, 5 running, 1 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states:  2.0% user, 97.6% system,  0.2% nice,  0.0% idle
Mem:  516968K av, 365056K used, 151912K free, 366896K shrd,  18520K buff
Swap: 611912K av,  19640K used, 592272K free                110968K cached
This is a VERY busy 21164SX Alpha.. any input would be great.
