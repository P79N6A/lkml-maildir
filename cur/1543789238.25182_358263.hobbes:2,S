Sorry, I sent the message before inserting this info:
- ibm tp runs with 2.6.12.5
- dell latitude runs with 2.6.10
I personally have access to the ibm tp and I'll test 2.6.13.3 in some hours
(which it nees to compile it).
I'll report more info than. Perhaps Daniel Aubry can test on his dell, too.
Nico
