Hey,
This time 5 incremental patches:
1       - Fix PIO handlers for Taskfile ioctls.
2a + 2b - Taskfile and flagged Taskfile PIO handlers unification.
3       - Map HDIO_DRIVE_CMD ioctl onto taskfile.
4       - Remove dead ide_diag_taskfile() code.
[ More comments inside patches. ]
Special care is needed for patch 3 as it is a bit experimental,
but at least hdparm -I /dev/hdx still works :-).
I have also made version using direct IO to user pages,
it works okay too but needs some more work to be elegant...
