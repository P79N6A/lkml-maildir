We must be reading different versions of generate_random_uuid ;-)

/* Structure of super block on disk */
struct reiserfs_super_block
{
/*  0 */    struct reiserfs_super_block_v1 s_v1;
/* 76 */    char sb_mnt_version[16];
/* 92 */    char sb_mkfs_version[16];
/*108 */    char sb_fsck_version[16];
/*124 */    char sb_unused[204-16-16-16-SB_SIZE_V1] ;
/* zero filled by mkreiserfs */ };
Show me the part where it knows what a uuid is.  It should at least be able
to show the uuid set by the kernel.
Please don't take this the wrong way, this is a good (and simple) patch
that adds a cool feature.  We just need to do a better job of having the
utils support the features before sending the patch it.  It does a better
job of proving we've tested the feature and that kernel patch fully meets
our needs.
