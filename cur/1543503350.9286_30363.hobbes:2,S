 I'm missing something here.. I have ben running 2.2.10 for a
while now and have not had any filesystem corruption.. I have a
TYAN Tomcat IV MB with onboard PCI/IDE controllers, connected to
a Western Digital 6.4Gig drive, and have never had any
filesystem problems with 2.2.5, 2.2.9, or 2.2.10 SMP or UP on
this system..
 just out of curiosity what are your uptimes like?
 how often do your drives get fsck?
 my system is only up max of 16 hours a day and then a manual
shutdown (till I get a UPS then I'll set up an automagic reboot
on sundays at midnight or something)
  I am assuming a straight 2.2.10 no other pathces?
