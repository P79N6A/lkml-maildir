No Silly is talking out of your acehole when you do not understand the
scope of the document and have not paid your lawyers to review and explain
the issues.
Everyone here forgets, GPL is WORTHLESS without a "REGISTERED" copyright.
You have no means for litigation in a court of law, without the registered
copyright.  Additionally, if you get to court you have to prove the value
of the item in question.  The general test is providing an alternative
commerial version which people have paid for in the past and today.
Without a value and proof you got ZERO, just a few facts from reality.
See it is a rubber duck document, all symbol and no life.
Later.
