If all of test_clear_page_dirty() has been commented out then the page will
never become clean hence will never fall out of pagecache, so unless Andrei
is doing a reboot before checking for corruption, perhaps the underlying
data on-disk is incorrect, but we can't see it.
Andrei, how _are_ you running this test?    What's the exact sequence of steps?
In particular, are you doing anything which would cause the corrupted file
to be evicted from memory, thus forcing a read from disk?  Such as
unmounting and then remounting the filesystem?
The point of my question is to check that the data is really incorrect
on-disk, or whether it is incorrect in pagecache.
Also, it'd be useful if you could determine whether the bug appears with
the ext2 filesystem: do s/ext3/ext2/ in /etc/fstab, or boot with
rootfstype=ext2 if it's the root filesystem.
Thanks.
