Cool indeed! I wan't it too. Even if it doesn't give me the
precise information about where the stuff hung, it's allmost
always sufficient for me to see where it crashed around...
And far more convenient then RS232 console ore whatever in esp.
since it's sufficent in 90% of the cases I tend to trigger during
"experiments".
