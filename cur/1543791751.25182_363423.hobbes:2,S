Its totally racy. Its on the todo list but I'm waiting for the buffering
changes to get into the Linus kernel and tested before doing the next
chunk of work on it (firstly fixing the rx/tx locking, then removing
TTY_DONT_FLIP which is a precursor to sanity for polled serial devices
and DMA)

It all needs considerable work. Fixing the receive/transmit locking is
IMHO by far the most important however now the buffers are done.
