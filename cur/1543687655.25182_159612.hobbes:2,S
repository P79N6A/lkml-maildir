The naming "i_mmap_shared" does suggest that once upon a time those
lists were as you'd like; and that at some point it was changed.
Perhaps some arches prefer the coherency guarantee I'm familiar with
in MAP_PRIVATE (yes, when you modify a page yourself, it cows off and
becomes private; but in i386 it's shared up until then), and other
arches (like yours) would prefer to avoid the overhead.
