   OK, but my current syslogd only listens to /dev/log as a
   SOCK_DGRAM.  If I wanted reliable syslogging, it would be listening
   on it as a SOCK_STREAM.
SOCK_DGRAM over AF_UNIX is reliable, it's a local transport.
With AF_UNIX the only real difference between SOCK_DGRAM and
SOCK_STREAM is whether writes must be atomic.  F.e. for the SOCK_DGRAM
case if you try to perform a write() larger than the socket buffer
size you'll get a EMSGSIZE return, whereas for the same example in
the SOCK_STREAM case the kernel will chop up the message for you and
send over the pieces seperately to the peer socket.
