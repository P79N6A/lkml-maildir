I can't find any readme in the Documentation folder about this, and I remember 
the original 'promise drivers goes gpl' thread degenerating into a license 
discussion.
I've got a 378 s150 tx chipset with their fasttrak raid bios. How should I 
configure the drives to use with the 2.6.3 kernel promise SATA driver? Can I 
configure them as a raid array?
TIA
