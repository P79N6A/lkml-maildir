I just described a design that -we already support-.
It's generic scalable model that has application outside the acronym
"TOE".  Did you read my message, or just see 'TOE' and nothing else?
Sun used this model with their x86 cards.  Total MP did something
similar with their 4-processor PowerPC cards.
There's nothing inherently wrong with sticking a computer running
Linux inside another computer ;-)
