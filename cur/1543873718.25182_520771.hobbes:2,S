hm, let's define "pending".
I assume that any future callers to sys_read() will reliably do the right
thing at this stage, so we are concerned with threads which are presently
partway through a read from this inode?
If that's not accurate then please describe with some detail exactly what
semantics you're looking for here.
If it _is_ accurate then hm, tricky.  It all rather depends upon how the
relevant filesystem implements reading (and writing?).  Which is why you
made it a file_operation, fair enough.
But even for ext2 and ext3 (please keep ext4 in sync with ext3 changes,
btw), if some process is partway through a big page_cache_readahead()
operation then a concurrent invalidate_inode_pages2() call won't worry it
at all: the pagecache will be reinstantiated and do_generic_mapping_read()
will proceed to copy that pagecache out to the user after the revoke() has
returned.  I think.
I'm afraid I havent paid any attention to this revoke proposal before, I
don't understand the usecases nor the implementation details so things
which are implicitly-obvious-to-you must be explained to me.  But others
will benefit from that explanation too ;)  What, exactly, are we trying to do
with the already-opened files and the currently-in-progress syscalls?
(A concurrent direct-io read might be a problem too?)
