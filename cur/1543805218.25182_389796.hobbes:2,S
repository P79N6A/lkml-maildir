Then access_ok() is not the droid you are looking for... since it won't 
catch several cases (out of memory being the most obvious).  Doing an 
early put_user() wouldn't hurt and reduces the chance of later failure 
even further.  __put_user() should never be used outside of a select few 
performance critical code paths.
