Hi Udo,
if my guessing is right - the only chance to hit it faster - is to increase
files' activity i.e. compiling the kernel involves a lot of file being readed
thru dcache system. First we have to locate the bug on a pure kernel
and 'case it's a rare thing to happen... well I don't really know how to
get it up to known point. So i think you could play with a pure kernel
by compiling it or run several copies of 'grep' thru kernel searching
the same pattern like "grep -r -n for ./*" in kernel sources. But Udo,
I'm not a kernel specialist so my suggestions could be not really usefull ;)
And as only you have found "approximated events" when the bug happend -
then we could try the same actions with my latest patch applied to find
if it happening exactly in dcache system. (damn, so many *if* there ;)
if you will not find that bug being reproducible in a simple way - just
leave all as it is, i'm trying to find problems in dcache system by code
reading.
P.S.
Lets CC LKML - that could help us ;)
