So that is around 1.8% in a benchmark. 
Not bad, if one considers, that this is an expensive syncronisation primitive 
anyway (and thus shouldn't dominate any real workload). At least _much_
better than possible stack underflow :-)
BTW: You forgot to include measurements with the unmodified code 
	as it is in Linus' tree now. They woule be a nice data point here.

But than you have an additional error path 
or have to sleep until memory becomes available.
Maybe try doubling IPCS_MAX_SCAN_ENTRIES - until the performance impact
is in the noise - is simpler. Up to 64 seems acceptable.
