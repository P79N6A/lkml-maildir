My previous message was meant as a warning of the assumption that
the aggregated reference frequency is all that matters. I was merely
pointing out how the number of processes referencing a page could affect
performance as well. Reference frequency is used as an estimator for
the _likelihood_ of a fault in the future, but the potential _impact_
of a fault grows with the number of processes that may block on it.
It is one possible (though not necessarily the most likely) explanation
for the symptoms I see with 2.6.
vmstat finds all processes blocked a lot more often in 2.6 than in
2.4, often for several seconds in a row. That only means something in
comparison, of course, because it is anything but a precise measurement
-- not only because of the 1 second snapshot granularity but also due
to the fact that bookkeeping of running and blocked processes in the
kernel is not accurate (processes may count as both blocked and running).
Typical log snippet for a kernel build under some 2.6.0-test release:

The trace above is not for the benchmark I referred to as kbuild in the
past few weeks (it was taken under lighter load). Even so 2.6 exhibits
significantly more periods with I/O wait and consequently takes longer
than 2.4 to complete.

What are you getting at? This may be easier for you to do because you
know what you are looking for.
