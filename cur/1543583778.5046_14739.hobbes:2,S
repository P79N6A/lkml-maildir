I think sysctls for balancing knobs is a great idea.  The VM has no
clue concerning the cost of rebuilding cache eg but a human may.
Automatic tuning would be wonderful, but it requires information
which the VM flat doesn't have.. so it should ask the boss for help.
Three handy knobs I can think of off the top of my head are swap_size,
flush_size [for page_launder().. bdflush has that] and cache_stickiness.
