Does this MIPS merge mean that the 2.4.19-pre2 kernel would work on a MIPS
based Cobalt Qube 2? It that's the case, then I just need a working 
userland.
The official Linux kernel from Cobalt is 2.0 vintage. I'm currently
running NetBSD 1.5.2 to have something a little more modern, but I would 
like to come back to Linux if possible.
