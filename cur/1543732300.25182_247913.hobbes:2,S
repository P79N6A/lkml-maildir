Correct: ptrinfo is a debug-only function. Intended to be called from 
kgdb stubs or for local printk debugging tests.
I think gdb even allows to call functions while it's stopped on a 
breakpoint.
I added it as an example what slab knows about it's objects - I have 
such test functions in my local files, but most developers don't know 
how slab tracks objects. It's reference code - I'm not sure if it 
belongs into the kernel or not.
