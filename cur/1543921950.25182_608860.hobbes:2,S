You might want to consider growing the buffer by no less than a small
constant factor like 1.3x. This will keep things that do short concats
in a loop from degrading to O(n^2) performance due to realloc and
memcpy.

Should probably just bite the bullet and pass a flag.

Too small. That will guarantee that most users end up doing a realloc.
Can we have 128 instead?
