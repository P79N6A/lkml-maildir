	It looks like that macro should be renamed to something like
STANDARD_MMC.  Everything that that macro controls still appears to 
go through ATA Packet Interface encapsulation.  Those quirks look like
they would likely be duplicated in a SCSI version of the same drives
anyhow.  It should be easy to have sr_mod accomodate those drives.
