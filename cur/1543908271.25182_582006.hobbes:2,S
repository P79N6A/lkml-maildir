I think it was very similar Ingo's patch, which after your testing
is in 2.6.23-rc2 now. I've moved return for level type irqs a little
later, and it works a new way only for "x86_64".
But, I think, now this patch is less important: if you find some time,
try mostly new Ingo's or Thomas' patches (latest possible versions).

Fine! If it's not said otherwise this version should be appropriate for
most of these patches. But, please, send your current configs on next
posibility (dmesg, /proc/interrupts and .config).
Bye (till monday),
