My version did queue_work(), iirc, but I seem to have lost it.
I have an old patch here from Brice Goglin which does it via an NMI, but
that's arch-specific, I guess.
afaict, we _could_ implement an IPI call which isn't deadlockable (on x86,
at least) if we were to make it an asynchronous one.
Even if the hardware doesn't support queueing, this could still be done in
software via suitable locking and software queueing.
Whatever.

iirc, this was the reason for not doing this years ago.  I don't know how
real that is.

Yeah, sometimes it helps to keep hitting it until you get the right CPU,
but that rather depends on interrupt distribution.
It would be neat to suppress the trace for idle CPUs.  I don't _think_
there's a need to display the trace for idle CPUs in sysrq-P?
