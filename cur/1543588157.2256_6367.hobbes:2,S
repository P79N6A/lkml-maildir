The mail states it's been forwarded to the moderator, yes I just got
one. Thats another issue here, Cc'ing a closed mailing list when
posting to an open list like linux-kernel is rude (but thats just a
minor issue in this discussion).

I know that Jens posted to linux-lvm-admin two days ago and didn't get
a response.
