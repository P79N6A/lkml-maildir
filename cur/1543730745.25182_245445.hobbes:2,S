[This is straying off the topic of files-as-directories].
st_mtime tests are weak.  They break sometimes, and are not suitable
for strong data models such as transparently caching generated data
from a file's contents.
They're especially breakable if you change a file and then read it
within a second.  Sometimes, more than a second.
As has been raised before, nanosecond timestamps (a) don't solve this
unless they're stored in the filesystem; (b) even then they will fail
one day, on a sufficiently fast box; (c) don't work when there are
changes to wall clock time.
They're fine where you don't care if the generated data is wrong sometimes.
If you want the _equivalent_ behaviour to opening and parsing the
file, but fast, then they're no good.
Modification serial numbers would work, though.
