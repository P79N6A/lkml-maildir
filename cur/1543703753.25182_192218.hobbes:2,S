It has come to my attention that in some places in the kernel, 'struct task_struct'
is used; and in others, 'task_t' is used.  Also, 'task_t' is
'typedef struct task_struct task_t;'.
I made a small script to change around as much as I could so that everything uses
task_t, but all the forward declarations make it difficult.  The script doesn't
work as-is, so it will take you a few tries to compile and remove duplicate
declarations of task_t.  If anyone's interested in changing all of these to be
consistent, this is your starting point.
running this in the top level of the source tree should get you started:
for i in `find . -type f`; do echo $i; cat $i | \
sed -e "s/struct task_struct/task_t/g" | \
sed -e "s/^\s*task_t;/struct task_struct;\ntypedef struct task_struct task_t;/g" \
> /tmp/tmpkernel; \
cat /tmp/tmpkernel > $i; rm /tmp/tmpkernel; done; \
cat include/linux/sched.h | \
sed -e "s/typedef task_t task_t/typedef struct task_struct task_t/g" | \
sed -e "s/task_t {/struct task_struct {/g" > /tmp/tmpkernel; \
cat /tmp/tmpkernel > include/linux/sched.h; rm /tmp/tmpkernel
That should also switch the forward declarations of struct task_struct over to
'struct task_struct; typedef struct task_struct task_t;' pairs.  This leaves a few
holes, as there are some places where the typedef occurs after one has already
occured, and so these need to be fixed.
I am only able to deal with i386, and there's a lot of stuff in the asm includes
that needs to be adjusted by hand after running the above script.
