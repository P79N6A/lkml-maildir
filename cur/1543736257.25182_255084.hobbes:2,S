Doing ldisc closes in the driver close path is also rather unsafe. The
ones I've found doing it I've removed.

ldisc dependant. It flushes the buffers but may not stop pending 
queued events.

That should not be possible. The terminal cannot be both blocking in
write_chan and executing a close path for the final opener.

In the old 2.0/lock_kernel world the wakeup would have woken the device
which would always have tested for hangup before queuing I/O. Nowdays a
lot of those are broken.

There is no way to do this. The close path isn't too nasty but hangup
makes it all quite evil.

On SMP the risk is that you've got pending events on another processor.
We ought to be ok for the main part because of the ref count on the file
and the close code making sure it cleans up for the ldisc. We do
have a problem because the ldisc and driver both needed to close first
in the old model. Thats mostly cured since drivers now take ldisc refs
the ldisc can reliably close first.

I had assumed would have to come from the serial side because if the
last owner is executing close() they can't be executing vhangup on the
same but given a rapid close/re-open/vhangup on a new fd it might be
a dangerous assumption. Added to the TODO pile
