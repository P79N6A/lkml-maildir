We need this for other issues as well. f.e. to establish memory allocation 
policies for the page cache, tmpfs and various other needs. Look at 
mempolicy.h which defines a subset of what we need. Currently there is no 
way to specify a policy when invoking the page allocator or slab 
allocator. The policy is implicily fetched from the current task structure 
which is not optimal.
