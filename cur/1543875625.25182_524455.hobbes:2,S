In case of misuse, yes.  But there are cases where we know that all CPUs 
will have softlockup issues, such as when doing a "big" sysrq-t dump.  
When doing the sysrq-t we take the tasklist_lock which prevents all 
other CPUs from scheduling -- this leads to bogus softlockup messages, 
so we need to reset everyone's watchdog just before releasing the 
tasklist_lock.
Another question -- are you going to expose disable/enable_watchdog to 
other subsystems?  Or are you going to expose touch_softlockup_watchdog?
