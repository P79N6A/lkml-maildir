Dear Linus,
I can't help but notice you've broken all the tools that rely on a
stable naming scheme TWICE in the span of LESS THAN ONE POINT RELEASE.
In both cases, this could have been avoided by using Marcello's 2.4
naming scheme. It's very simple: when you think something is "final",
you call it a "release candidate" and tag it "-rcX". If it works out,
you rename it _unmodified_ and everyone can trust that it hasn't
broken again in the interval. If it's not "final" and you're accepting
more than bugfixes, you call it a "pre-release" and tag it "-pre".
Then developers and testers and automated tools all know what to
expect.
