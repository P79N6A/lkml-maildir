Silence would be good.  "char *" has a special status in C, it can be:
- pointer to a char/to an array of chars (standard interpretation)
- pointer to a string
- generic pointer to memory you can read(/write)
Check the aliasing rules if you don't believe be on the third one.
And it's *way* more often cases 2 and 3 than 1 for the simple reason
that the signedness of char is unpredictable.  As a result, a
signedness warning between char * and (un)signed char * is 99.99% of
the time stupid.

That means a warning that triggers on every line saying "there may be
a bug there" does not entirely suck?

Almost completely.  The rules on aliasing say you can convert pointer
between signed and unsigned variants and the accesses will be
unsurprising.  The only problem is that the implicit conversion of
incompatible pointer parameters to a function looks impossible in the
draft I have.  Probably has been corrected in the final version.
In any case, having for instance unsigned int * in a prototype really
means in the language "I want a pointer to integers, and I'm probably
going to use it them as unsigned, so beware".  For the special case of
char, since the beware version would require a signed or unsigned tag,
it really means indeterminate.
C is sometimes called a high-level assembler for a reason :-)

In this day and age it means "I want a 0-terminated string".
Everything else is explicitely signed char * or unsigned char *, often
through typedefs in the signed case.

That would require pointers tagged in a way or another, you can't
distinguish between pointers to differently-signed versions of the
same integer type otherwise (they're required to have same size and
alignment).  You don't have that on modern architectures.

It's a warning you're talking about.  That means it is _legal_ in the
language (even if maybe implementation defined, but legal still).
Otherwise it would be an error.

No, it wouldn't be logical, because char is *special*.

Because a cast to silence a warning silences every possible warning
even if the then-pointer turns for instance into an integer through an
unrelated change.  Think for instance about an error_t going from
const char * (error string) to int (error code) through a patch, which
happened to be passed to an utf8_to_whatever conversion function that
takes an const unsigned char * as a parameter.  Casting would hide the
impact of changing the type.

Everybody who has ever done text manipulation in languages other than
english knows for a fact that chars must be unsigned, always.  The
current utf8 support frenzy is driving that home even harder.

"blahblahblah"'s type is const char *.

The best option is to have gcc stop being stupid.  -Funsigned-char
creates an assumption which is actually invisible in the code itself,
making it a ticking bomb for reuse in other projects.
