Except usually the truly annoyed can reprogram the chipset so an SMI
interrupt is not generated.  But I doubt that is practical on a
laptop.

Hmm.  I wonder if this is a simple transition technique or if it is
their long term strategy.  
Now I'm going to research and see if SMM mode is supported on with
x86-64 and ia64.  With ACPI the case can at least be made that SMM
mode is not strictly necessary and should be dropped.  I'm dreaming
but if the processors didn't have this super protected mode, BIOS
vendors and operating system vendors would be force to cooperate on
these issues.
