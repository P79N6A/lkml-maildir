My first instinct is that #define'ing CAN_MIGRATE_TASK in the midst
of a function needs to die a horrible death ;-) But you didn't start
that one, so other than that ...
My instinct would tell me the first expression should be ||, not &&
but I'm not 100% sure. And is this restricted to just clones? Doesn't
seem to be, unless that's implicit in homenode_unset?
