I think these tests are a waste of time. struct tcf_police is not
userspace-visible, so it's highly unlikely that the tc version matters.
Why an old kernel needs to be tested is beyond me. For possible in-kernel
breakage caused by the restructuring, without CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT,
struct tcf_police is only used in police.c, without any casts or
assumptions about layout, so I can't see what could break. With
CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT, the only place where it is used outside of
police.c is tcf_action_copy_stats, and this is exactly what this patch
(tested) fixes.
If you still want to do these test, please use the attached patch.
Regards
Patrick
