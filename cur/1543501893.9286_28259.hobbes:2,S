I've had a lot of complaints about this from users using the
international kernel patch and who has been unlucky enough to move
their files.  Since nobody is fixing the kernel in a backwards
compatible way, and this just bite too many people, there is now a
CONFIG_ option in the IKP that will pass the relative offset to the
transfer function.  If will also use 512 byte blocks so you don't get
problems when moving the file onto a CD-ROM.  It's a hack, it's not
backwards compatible, but it's better than nothing IMO.
