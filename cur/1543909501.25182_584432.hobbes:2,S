Hm, I think it would be better to keep them together.  The second add is
going to be pretty much free, particularly since the tx_bytes add will
probably pull tx_packets into cache.
I have a followup patch to convert it to using the netdevice stats
structure, which will definitely put them in the same cacheline (though
perhaps the stats structure should group tx and rx members together?).
