Why would you need any kind of lock when just changing a single bit,
if it didn't affect other bits of the same word?  Just as you don't
need a lock when simply assigning a word, setting a bit to 0 or 1
is simple in itself (it doesn't matter if it was 0 or 1 before).

I firmly believe that it is; but I'm not a processor expert.

read-modify-write indeed.  That's exactly what the "lock" prefix is
needed for, isn't it?  To lock together the read-modify-write cycles
to make the entire operation atomic on SMP.  Without which you may
lose the changes made concurrently to the same word by another cpu,
or it lose yours.
(If another cpu is merely changing the same bit as you are, no problem:
either you're both changing it to the same value, or you're racing to
set it to opposite values, and one of you wins - fair enough, however
much locking you add, you're still left with the situation that two
are racing and one wins in the end.)
You now seem to be arguing, never mind your original PageLRU case,
that include/asm-i386/bitops.h and include/asm-x86_64/bitops.h
don't need the LOCK_PREFIX before the "btsl" in set_bit().
I disagree with you; but let someone more authoritative speak up.
Mabye Andi can explain it a lot better than I can?
