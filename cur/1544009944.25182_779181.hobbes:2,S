It's often used by the drivers, but currently not handled by
the subsystem. For example, _remove() callback might return -EBUSY
or -EAGAIN, which means that whoever called the _remove() should
try later.
For example see drivers/mfd/asic3.c. The driver registers GPIO
chips, on _remove() it *tries* to unregister these chips, but
it could fail (when provided GPIOs are in use by somebody -- it
might be in-kernel users, or sysfs users).
