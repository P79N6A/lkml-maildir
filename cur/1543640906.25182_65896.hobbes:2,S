Basically think about the consequences of trying to handle a completely 
unknown state -- if you are going to attempt to handle this you would 
need to check for data, not just the BSY bit.  And read the data into a 
throwaway buffer, if there is data to be read, or write the data it's 
expecting.
So it's not just the busy bit :)
