Brian,
That is an ancient kernel well over a year old, I would try a
later kernel.
At a min put on a later kernel, and maybe put on FC4 as there
as are several different kernels to choose from there, some
of which may have issues, others of which may work.
You might also check when and how your are doing "exportfs -r"
and other exportfs type commands because I have seen this command
before cause interesting race conditions (ie there is a spot
where apparently the clients get a failure response).   My setup
to get those messages required a busy machine, and updating
/etc/exports in cron and rerunning exportfs often, even with
all of that the failures were pretty rare, and only affected
some nodes on a given failure.
I don't know if the bug is still around, but it is something
to check.
