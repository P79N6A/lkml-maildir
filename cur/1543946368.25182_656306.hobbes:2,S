I'll look at it some more as I don't really have a preference either.
One thing that also bothered me was other cpus read the per cpu
variable to get the node number whilst the current cpu reads the pda
variable.  I'll see about resolving that quirky-ness.  (All one or all
the other.)
(And of course the problem with cpus on nodes with no local memory
needs to be resolved as well.)
Thanks,
