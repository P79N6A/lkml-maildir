As you expect, in such a condition (with only ehci loaded), absolutely nothing 
happens when plugging the mouse.
OTOH, a high-speed device is recognized, althouh it generates messages like:
totor kernel: usb 1-5: device not accepting address 3, error -71
totor kernel: usb 1-5: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4
totor kernel: usb 1-5: device not accepting address 4, error -71
totor kernel: usb 1-5: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 5
If plugged to any USB socket, except the two integrated to the motherboard 
connectors plate. There only it fully succeeds without such errors.
Cheers.
