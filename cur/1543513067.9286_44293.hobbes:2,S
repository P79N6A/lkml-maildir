If you mean that I applied the patch I developed before compiling it,
then I have to admit that such was indeed the case.

The only place I ever put LILO is in the boot sector of whichever
partition contains the /boot directory, and NEVER in the MBR, and as a
result, I never have any problems with other OS's corrupting the MBR.
They are welcome to do what they wish with it, as I can soon use even
the Win95 fdisk to specify that it should boot from the relevant Linux
partition.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
