Subject: Problems with 2.3.35 and bash?

I've had 2.3.35 up and running for a few days now, and came home
today to experience a rather strange problem with it and bash.
First off, I'll note that I'm using bash 2.01.1.
As an example of the problem, giving the following on the command
line causes a segmentation fault and exit:
$ FOO=foo
This does not happen immediately but only after a few days.
This affected scripts that happen to use bash, and essentially
made my system unusable. 
This kind of error didn't seem to happen when I exec'd (for example)
csh, so I assume this is a problem with bash and the new kernel.
I hope this problem can be resolved!
Thanks
Tim
