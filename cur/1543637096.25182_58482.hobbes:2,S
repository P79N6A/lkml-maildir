   Please don't apply this.  By leaving the trailing "," on enums, additional 
   values can be added by merely inserting an additional + line in a patch, 
   otherwise there are excess conflicts when multiple patches add values to 
   the enum.
I totally agree.
What is the purpose of all of these zany patches?  Are you going to
remove the inline assembler from the whole tree too? :-)
