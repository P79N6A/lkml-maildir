> i don't know what you mean by "channel" information in this context.
after reading some more code i believe the concept is called 'stream' in
ALSA speak. How many streams did Rui's test utilize? (nine?)
if multiple streams were used, then can the handling of one stream delay
another stream? How are streams prioritized, and are they queued in a
FIFO or in a LIFO manner? (Also, are such 'streams' directly mapped to
some hardware concept on the audio card ('channel' or 'voice'?) or am i
confusing things?)
