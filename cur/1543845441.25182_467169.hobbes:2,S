Just FYI, the onboard "SBLive" is not a real SBLive! - it uses a newer,
cheaper, and vastly inferior chipset that moves all of the interesting
hardware features of the good old SBLive! into the (Windows) driver. 
I would be surprised if it had the same issues as the original emu10k1
chipset, which generated a lot more bus traffic by implementing multiple
stream mixing in hardware.
IOW, this bug is probably unrelated to the SBLive...
