It literally means to not copy that VMA _at_all_. Basically, the mapping
simply won't show up in the child. It's kind of the mapping equivalent of
close-on-exec..
NOTE! Ingo - you might want to check with the shared-page-table people
about this, I remember us talking about discontinuing the feature because
it makes shared page tables harder to implement. Other than that it's a
trivial feature.
