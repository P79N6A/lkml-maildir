Looks good to me (the diffstat difference is probably because the
patches were consecutive, and the sum of them are smaller (modifying
same parts of the files, etc.))
The git-changes-script shows that you picked up everything from my trees
successfully (assuming we trust that so far) and a raw diff looks good
too.
Two "odd" things in the changelog:

It looks like your domain name isn't set up properly for your box (which
is why it worked for you, but not me before, causing that patch).
Also the date is in the future with the -0700, yet the time is in UTC.
Oh wait, that's a 'git log' thing, the raw changeset is correct, I guess
I'll wait for Pasky to fix that :)

Very nice.
