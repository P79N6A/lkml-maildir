Reiser4 plugins have to be compiled into the kernel.  (They're not
plugins in the sense that most people use that word.)  And any admin who
would compile that kind of plugin into the kernel needs to have his head
examined.  Not to mention that plugins must first go through Hans and/or
Linus before they can get included into the kernel.
The kernel defines the set of plugins available to the user.  The user
selects (to a certain degree) which plugins to use.
