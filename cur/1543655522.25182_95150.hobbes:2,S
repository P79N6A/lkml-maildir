Something like that was my first though as well. I would have played
games with return addresses inside the kernel instead of user space.
The idea to have another _TIF_xxx flag seems much cleaner though and
I want the cleanest solution for this. Once this is implemented every
system call can be restarted with a different system call number. Who
knows what other uses this might have?
