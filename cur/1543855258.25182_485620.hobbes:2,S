Actually, this patch causes my ATAPI device not to appear initially.  It
looks like the libata IDENTIFY is failing.  It seems to be a problem
with the initial reset the device needs to get the D2H FIS.  This is
what I see:
sas: sas_ata_phy_reset: Found ATAPI device.
ata1.00: ATAPI, max UDMA/66
aic94xx: escb_tasklet_complete: phy5: BYTES_DMAED
aic94xx: STP proto device-to-host FIS:
