As I wrote in another e-mail, why makes this proportion different for
the other conditions determined by the GPL?
I.e., what is it that makes this particular condition so allegedly
harmful for bringing in more developers and contributions, when
compared with the requirements on passing on source code, licensing
necessary patents, not suing other users over patent infringement in
the software, not invoking anti-circumvention laws, not entering
discriminatory agreements?

Err...  I have no idea of the actual user base of TiVo, but if it's
really in the millions, and your 10% figure above is right, this makes
for hundreds of thousands of hackers that could be scratching their
itches and improving Linux on TiVo boxes.
How many thousand employees does TiVo have working on Linux?
(I realize a full-time employee is a lot more than a Joe Random
Hacker, but still, I'm keeping a ratio of 100:1 to make up for that)

Good for you!
