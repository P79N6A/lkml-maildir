Just the module.  If inserted into a UP kernel, grabbing the lock
would never fail.  Is it really impossible to do this?  (Please
educate me.)  The only cost I see is the memory for the locks which
the UP kernel needs to allocate, even though it will never use
them.[1]

It is a pain to maintain hundreds of machines which vary in subtle
ways.  If I could compile a module _once_ and rdist it to all the
workstations, it would make life a lot easier.
I don't see why it is so evil to reduce the variables when compiling a
module.  Combinatorial growth and all that.

[1] It looks like the memory _is_ allocated if you compile with GCC < 2.8...
