I think it varies between people:
I like light on dark but fairly low contrast, yet I've read that more
contrast is better.  I like typing in dark on light from time to time
(as now), but not all the time.  Change is good.  A good font is
important IMO.  Good colour is helpful if you can see colours -- I've
found a larger font and colour highlighting while editing code let's me
see more (fewer blank lines) while seeing it more clearly.
btw, I can barely stand to look at my laptop screen when it is mostly
white.  It is far too bright, even in the "low power" dull mode.  OTOH
when it's not all white it's fine.

The effect of ambient lighting is often underestimated.  IMO it should
be a compulsory part of basic office training, along with various
postures and exercises.  I'm very fussy, but rarely do I get the
lighting I'd like because noone takes it seriously.
Likewise with sound: In my office we're aware that the noise of all the
computers is deafening but that hasn't helped us do much about it.  IMO
the effect of computer background noise does not help with the eyestrain...
