For kernel versions 2.3.41 and 2.3.42 (thus far), there are two l-o-n-g
pauses during the boot sequence on my machine when network services are
being started.  "syslogd" takes approximately a minute to start, and "rwhod"
isn't much better.  I had reported earlier that the machine hung while
trying to start "syslogd" under 2.3.41: that was incorrect (I wasn't patient
enough).  Got the idea to try waiting on it from other people who were
reporting long startup times for various network-related programs.
Hope this helps someone track down the problem.
