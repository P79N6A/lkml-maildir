in the LinuxBIOS, acpi support is there including acpi tables and dsdt
for amd chipset.
but for other chipset, I can not put dsdt there. becase we need one
clean room implementation for dsdt with those chipset.
So I have all acpi tables (SRAT, SLIT, ...) but no dsdt.
We need to use mptable instead of MADT + dsdt for io apic irq routing.
I forget to remove MADT in one test, the kernel will skip the mptable.
After look at the kernel acpi code, it turns out that
acpi_process_madt will set acpi_lapic, and acpi_ioapic.  So
get_smp_config will skip the mptable.
With normal BIOS, if there is problem with DSDT, and you are trying
acpi=noirq, it means you are going to PIC mode instead of APIC mode if
you are skipping mptable.
