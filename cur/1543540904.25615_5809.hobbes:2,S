FYI, managed to hardlock today.
I was configuring my interfaces(2) with wrong addresses (damn
ifcfg-eth0~ in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts)
and nfsd was running
then I did /etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart
and it did hang quite soon, on taking down the eth0
later on it went ok, when nfs was stopped.
I did not try to reproduce it, if anyone seriously needs, I will.
elmer.
