Seems reasonable... however CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR really has two
overloaded meanings (at least on i386).  First of all, as you say, it
does enable drivers to request MSI/MSI-X.  However, on i386
CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR also changes how the APIC is setup (the most
visible effect of which is different interrupt numbers).
I would propose the following course of action:
 1) Merge Long's latest MSI/MSI-X patches (updated patches in
    
http://gmane.linux.kernel/218830
).  Without the new semantics of
    pci_disable_msi()/pci_disable_msix(), it's very difficult to use
    MSI/MSI-X in a device driver.
 2) Split the config options so we have an i386-specific
    CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR and a generic CONFIG_PCI_MSI (with
    CONFIG_PCI_MSI depending on something like !I386 || CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR)
    This would be an updated version of your patch.
 3) Make the code in drivers/pci/msi.c less Intel-specific -- instead
    of hard-coding Intel-specific addresses for vectors have the
    computation call into arch code.  This would be a fair amount of
    work and depends documentation for non-Intel platforms that
    implement MSI/MSI-X -- should be easier as PCI Express comes out.
