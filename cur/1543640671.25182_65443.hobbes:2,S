Unfortunately I already have ACPI, APIC and SMP disabled and cannot boot
the 2.4 kernels - I tried RedHat's LIMBO beta boot disk and I couldn't
boot either. It seems that the problem occurs at a very early stage at
boot.
Can anybody tell me if there is a possibility to further debug my boot
problem, for example enabling  more verbose boot messages ?
Best regards
