Two ways:
- - continue to use the old code
- - backport the required functionality
Note that not all the changes Ingo made have to be ported back to 2.4. 
Only those required for correct execution, not the optimizations.
Whether Marcello is interested in this I cannot say, I doubt it though. 
  But this does not mean you cannot have such a kernel in Debian.
