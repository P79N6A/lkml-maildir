Hm, you might want to take a look at the cPCI patches from Scott Murray,
he has a solution for the resource and insertion problem that will
probably work for you.  You can find the patches on the pcihpd-discuss
mailing list, and I think they were also posted to lkml in the past too.
He's working on cleaning them up a bit for inclusion in the main kernel
tree.
Hope this helps,
