Nope.

See kernel/timer.c:count_active_tasks().  It does
read_lock(&task_list_lock) to pin everything down
while it walks the task list in an interrupt.
And you're in luck - tasklist_lock is exported to modules.

That sounds sane.  Pin the user pages, set up a kernel virtual
mapping of them.  You can't rely on userspace having performed
the mlock of course; you'll need to pin the pages in-kernel.
Probably you can just use map_user_kiobuf().

I guess that if you've pinned the pages, then you're safe even
if the task exits - the pages won't be going away.  But your
interrupt will need to deal with the kiovec, not the process mm.
This could end up meaning that your final page_cache_release()
happens in interrupt context.  We may have a problem with that
if the page is still on the global LRU.  See the thread
