Is a breakdown somewhere of what is covered at this point? The two
letters followed by six number driver files make it difficult to see
which arches use what. :)

With a list of arches that are covered, I'll start working on patches to
do so.

Yea. We also need to make sure every arch has something that will work
w/o special compile time config options.

Indeed. If we cannot initialize xtime early, that's not an issue.
settimeofday() will fix that up. However the suspend/resume ordering
issue is more difficult. On resume we need to have something usable
before we resume the timekeeping code in order to correctly increment
xtime and jiffies in one atomic action.

Thanks for the clarification.
With regards to more powerful RTCs, those I don't really care too much
about. I just want access the battery backed clock for suspend/resume
and watchdog uses.

Where is this code? I'm interested here, but I suspect for correctness
that bit should be under the control of the timekeeping core.

Ok. I'm not totally sold on it, but I'll start looking in more detail
here. Starting w/ i386 and possibly moving across the rest of the
arches.

Ehh. That's definitely not the direction I'm trying to go (although I
guess one could possibly do so). I just want the 3 items above. :)
