Subject: [PATCH] remove unconditional PCI ACPI IRQ routing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/5/305

Now that PCI interrupts are routed in pci_enable_device(), remove
the unconditional routing previously done in pci_acpi_init().
This has the potential to break drivers that don't use
pci_enable_device() correctly, so I also added a "pci=routeirq"
kernel option that restores the previous behavior.  I intend to
remove that option, along with all the code below, in a month
or so.
