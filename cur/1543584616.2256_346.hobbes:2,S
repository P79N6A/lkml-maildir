I am still having problems with this driver.
When loading the driver I get:
es1371: version v0.27 time 00:47:56 Mar  7 2001
es1371: found chip, vendor id 0x1274 device id 0x1371 revision 0x08
PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:0b.0
es1371: found es1371 rev 8 at io 0xa400 irq 10
es1371: features: joystick 0x0
ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: 0x0000:0x0000 (Unknown)
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
This last line seems strange as /proc/interrupts does not list IRQ7:
  0:    2515137          XT-PIC  timer
  1:      18752          XT-PIC  keyboard

The chip is actually a Cirrus Logic CS4297A.
