Well that is one usage of the PageReserved flag. That one tends
to be easily covered by VM_RESERVED (ie. it is no longer used that
way after the patches).
The remaining problem is, in fact, these "other" uses of PageReserved.
One usage definitely appears to be "is this page valid RAM?".

I thought ioremap was attempting to avoid remapping physical
RAM with that check. All drivers I have looked at which allocate
physical memory then SetPageReserved the pages use remap_pfn_range
but I admit that's not a huge number (that I have looked at).

I'm fairly sure that's not the case on i386 at least. I think
pfn_valid will be true if the pfn points to a struct page.
See arch/i386/mm/init.c:one_highpage_init()

That's what I'm aiming for. I admit it is confusing and I haven't
looked at all drivers or architectures, so if I'm missing a vital
clue then I wouldn't be too surprised ;)
