	I understand what you've read.  I've merely been telling you
that there aren't enough ranges for the number of disks we'd like to
handle.  Never mind that a larger dev_t is significantly clearer, or
that a large minor space can help us move to a single disk major if we
want to go there.

	I've been in contact with Andreas.  I've been trying to get
stuff tested.  I'm ready to commit resources with tons of disks to
test as soon as the code is capable.  I'm not whining, I'm active.
Please, you're a smart guy, let's keep this civil.
