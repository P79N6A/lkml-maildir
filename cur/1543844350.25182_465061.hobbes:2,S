Ok, so here is my attempt at keeping panic blink in console whithout
atkbd bitching at us about ACKs/NAKs. Console scrollback still does
not work for me, most likely because it needs scheduler to run, but
SysRq seems to be working well.
Please try it and tell meif it works for you. Thanks!

Input: i8042 - supress ACK/NAKs when blinking during panic
This allows using SysRq and not fill logs with complaints from atkbd.
