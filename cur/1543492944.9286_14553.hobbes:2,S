Since that something (the time the system was last booted) does not
live in that file, or in any other file for that matter, your agrument
fails miserably.
True, if you can predict the precice second at which the next booting
kernel will grab the time, you could edit the file successfully, but
even an error of ONE SECOND will mean that your edit would fail...and
that error could easily be reduced to TEN MILLISECONDS on am ix86
based system...

Any method that does NOT include some form of validation after each
boot is inherently insecure, and you can argue all you like against
including security, but you stand little chance of having your
arguments accepted.
 > The whole idea of capabilities in the file itself is broken.
If true, then the idea of having information on how to load an
executable in the file itself is also broken. After all, that's a
capability in itself - the capability to execute the file. If the
kernel doesn't recognise the header format of the file, it can't
execute it...
Remember, the ONLY time ANY capability information needs to be checked
is when the system has just been asked to execute the file in question
as otherwise it's irrelevant. As a result, any argument against
reading the contents of the file are non-starters as the file will be
read as part of executing it, just to find out what format it's in.
As a result, that argument is a non-starter, best described as FUD.
 > It smears out the privileges over the filesystem and the file

The only serious alternative offered so far was to have a file
somewhere that listed the name and path of all capable binaries
together with their capabilities, and your comment above doesn't even
differentiate between the two systems...

That's up to the PERL interpreter to handle, not the kernel. After
all, the kernel ignores s[gu]id on scripts already, and the only
reason s[gu]id works on PERL scripts is because the PERL interpreter
handles the relevant capabilities if it sees the s[gu]id flag set on
the script it's running.
Out of curiosity, are you an idealist, a pragmatist or a realist?
Based on the above and your earlier posts, I'd have to assume you're
an idealist who's unwilling to accept anything other than a perfect
world.
As a pragmatist myself, I see the move from s[gu]id to capabilities
being of necessity an evolutionary one, starting from the current
position of pure s[gu]id and moving through a hybrid scheme such as
the above towards a pure capabilities scheme.

If one needs SPECIAL tools to handle the BACK-UP of binaries with
capabilities, then the capability implementation is by definition
broken.
Granted, theere will need to be special provision to RESTORE such
binaries if they get corrupted, but nobody's said otherwise.

Eitheer via a hybrid system or not at all. Take your pick.

That is an extremely unlikely scenario, considering there are still
systems in use running kernels prior to 2.0.0. I suggest you adopt a
more realistic stance...

Really?

So will hybrid networks, with different systems running diffeerent
kernels. I run one myself, with systems running various kernels from
the 2.0.27 to 2.0.36 range, and other systems running the 2.2.4 and
2.2.5 kernels. Those running the 2.0 series kernels are unlikely to be
changed in the near future.

The simplest way to get it right is to devise a SECURE system that can
be handled by the existing tools with MINIMAL modification.

In my opinion, there are ALREADY too many s[gu]id files to make that
an option...

If we don't go through that scenario, then we will never get to a pure
caps-based system in my opinion.
