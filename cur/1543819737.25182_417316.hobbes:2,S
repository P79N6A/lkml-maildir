Hi,
I'd like some feedback about this patchset -- whether it is the right
design, and the implementation (e.g. people might dislike patch 4).
vm_insert_page and remap_pfn_range loops are really clever, bit
probably asking a bit too much of most drivers. I was able to get
rid of most of them without too much trouble.
Not tested, because I don't have any of the hardware, but it seems
compiles OK.
Nick
