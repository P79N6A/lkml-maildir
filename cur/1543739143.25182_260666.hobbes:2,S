What Ingo is doing now is mostly like a temporary fix for dealing with
this issue. Simple backing with a normal mutex should be sufficient for
protecting that access. RCU is still an open problem.

It's a read-mostly read/write lock. N number of real processors can
do N number of read locks. That structure needs to be emulated somehow
and a per CPU mutex is probably the correct method of getting it.
It's just a matter of how. I did suggest something in my project
announcement.
I don't know if it's crack smoking or not. :)
