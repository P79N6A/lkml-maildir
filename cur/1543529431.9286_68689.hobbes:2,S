It is trivial to solve this problem in a satisfactory
way for 99% of the situations. There has never been a
100% solution however and the last three times I sent
such code to linux-kernel a (small) flamewar started.
If Linus indicates he's willing to accept something 
like my 2.2 oom killer patch into 2.3, I'll code
something up.

Rik
