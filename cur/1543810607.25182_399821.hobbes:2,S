Subject: Loading e100 and uhcd-hcd at (almost) same time disables IRQ with 2.6.16-rc4

This is with a supermicro P3TSSE mainboard, with an Intel 815E chipset, where 
the two integrated network adapters (Intel82559 10/100 Ethernet) and one of the 
two usb host adapters share the same IRQ (irq 11).
When udev synthesizes hotplug events during boot and there is interrupt activity
(e.g. by flood pinging one interface) I get an "irq 11: nobody cared" message 
followed by a traceback and "Disabling IRQ #11". After that unsurprisingly both 
network adapters are dead which is unfortunate as this usually is a headless 
server machine.
I reproduced the problem on another identical hardware, so faulty hardware is 
(almost) ruled out. The bug is already present in 2.6.14, I did not try to trace 
it farther back.
dmesg from normal and failed boots and further info can be found on
