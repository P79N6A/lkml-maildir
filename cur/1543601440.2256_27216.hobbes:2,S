just make sure not to renice top at -10. Are you sure you reniced top at
-10 also with pre10? Those issues shouldn't really vm related. I also
profiled the new vm well and it never showed up in the toplist so I
suspect you changed something in userspace. and of course I run xmms all
the time too and it didn't skept one sample yet.
