I would disagree with that. The _common case_ for allocation is:
	p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), ...);
For which you know that you are allocating enough memory for the struct. 
Now the only way to screw it up is to write:
	p = kmalloc(sizeof(p), ...);
That is trivial to grep for.
Yes, currently, typedefs and open-coded kcalloc's give false positives but
that's what kernel janitors are for...
