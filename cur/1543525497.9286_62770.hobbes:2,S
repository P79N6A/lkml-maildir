> Philipp's point is still valid though, u32 is only 2 byte aligned on
Alan's point.  My point was you could rely on gcc not padding structures
when you always explicitly padded to natural alignment boundaries.  Eg
when you do struct { u16 s; u32 l; } you deserve to get burned, but when
you do struct { u16 s;  u16 unused;  u32 l; } you can expect gcc not to
be smart on you.
