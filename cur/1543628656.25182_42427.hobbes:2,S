Sorry, that doesnt fly. If I dont work on SCSI, only on networking, I
/dont/ need the SCSI code. Even if I had it, I wouldnt read it.
I deleted all the arch directories except ARM and X86 on my machine to
speed up grepping the kernel.
so, not having all the source can speed thigs up.

This developer would too.
