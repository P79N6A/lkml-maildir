why are non-linux environments even relevant to the discussion ?
we're talking about fixing up a *linux header* file, so anyone doing
"#include <linux/cdrom.h>" in a non-linux environment is just stupid.
if yourpersonaldistro is a pos and doesnt provide a POSIX compliant
limits.h, then that distro is garbage and should be deleted and have
no bearing whatsoever on the direction of linux.
