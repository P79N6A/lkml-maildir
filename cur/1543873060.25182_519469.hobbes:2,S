I only find a slowdown, no choppiness, no audio stutter (it would be extremely 
hard to make audio stutter in this design without i/o starvation or something 
along those lines). The number difference in cpu percentage I've already 
given on the previous email. The graphics driver does feature in this test 
case as well so others' mileage may vary. Mike said it was terrible.

Kernel compiles seem similar till the jobs get above about 3 where rsdl gets 
slower but still smooth. Audio is basically unaffected either way.
Don't forget all the rest of the cases people have posted.
