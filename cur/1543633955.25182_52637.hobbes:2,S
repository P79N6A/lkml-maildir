OK, that makes sense.  (The "buggy" wasn't intended as any kind of
put-down, it was just what I had been told.)
What ends up in the official places?  Zeroes, maybe?
Can we discriminate between these bridges, and bridges which use the
official places but where the firmware has closed an aperture?  I
really would like the code not to assume the bridge is transparent in
the latter case.
Paul.
