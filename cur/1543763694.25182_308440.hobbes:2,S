I had the same nasty surprise this morning, this will probably help:
Well, this is a brown paper bag for someone.  The new protocol
registration locking uses a rwlock to limit access to the protocol list.
Unfortunately, the initialisation:
static rwlock_t proto_list_lock;
Only works to initialise the lock as unlocked on platforms whose unlock
signal is all zeros.  On other platforms, they think it's already locked
and hang forever.
