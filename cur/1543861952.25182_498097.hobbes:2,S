That is certainly true.  I just found it odd that intel wouldn't have an
ahci driver available.  But then again if ahci is standard I guess they
would expect microsoft to provide the driver instead, which they
probably aren't doing until vista.  Linux always seems so much easier.
:)  The drivers are just included for everything.
