This is similar to my patch-names patch, which lets you add components to
uname too. IIRC, it was rejected because it made things easier.

+This patch adds a simple method to identify patched kernels. Patches
+that include a file named 'patchdesc.*' in the top level source
+directory will cause the kernel to add the file extension to the
+version that is reported by uname(1). For instance, this file will
+result in the 2.x.x+name being reported.
