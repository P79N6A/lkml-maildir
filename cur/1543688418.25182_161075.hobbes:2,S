	There is no law that says the kernel can't re-order on a per-byte basis.
Memory visibility and posted writes could, at least in theory, result in
this outcome today. Future technology may make it even more probable.

	Yes, but you can't trust that multiple 32 bit memory updates won't be seen
out of order by another processor without appropriate barriers or
synchronization.

	I believe it still is. The 'fsync' function does not synchronize another
process' view of memory. It is not a memory barrier and, in any event, if it
was a memory barrier it would be running in the wrong place. The 'fsync'
function syncs the memory with stable storage, it does not synch (or at
least, it is not guaranteed to sync) with the memory view of another
process.
	Nothing stops speculative reads for the two halves of the data, each in
their own 32-bit unit, from crossing in time. Even if it's not possible on
today's hardware, it is still possible in principle.
