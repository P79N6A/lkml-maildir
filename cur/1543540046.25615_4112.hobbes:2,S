Well, "both client and server had to be" doesn't count very much.

Oh yes this is. I don't merely refer to NFS with ACLs. Hell, NT doesn't
do NFS by default. I mean an NFSv4 ACL is structured like an NT ACL.
The inheritance, types, and scanning algorithm are all from NT.
See 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-nfsv4-07.txt
 and
the online NT developer documentation; compare them yourself.
NFSv4 ACLs are not just rwx permissions. Instead of those 3 bits,
you get 17 bits. Here they are:
READ_DATA          read the data of the file
LIST_DIRECTORY     list the contents of a directory
WRITE_DATA         modify the file's data
ADD_FILE           add a new file to a directory
APPEND_DATA        append data to a file
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY   create a subdirectory to a directory
READ_NAMED_ATTRS   read the named attributes of a file
WRITE_NAMED_ATTRS  write the named attributes of a file
EXECUTE            execute a file
DELETE_CHILD       delete a file or directory within a directory
READ_ATTRIBUTES    read basic attributes (non-acls) of a file
WRITE_ATTRIBUTES   change basic attributes (non-acls) of a file
DELETE             Delete the file
READ_ACL           Read the ACL
WRITE_ACL          Write the ACL
WRITE_OWNER        change the owner
SYNCHRONIZE        access file locally at the server with sync read/write
Where do you think SYNCHRONIZE and WRITE_OWNER come from? NFSv4 also
has inherit-once ability, under the ACE4_NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_ACE name.
NFSv4 even has 10 well-known identifiers and audit ACEs.
