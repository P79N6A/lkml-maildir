I don't know what facts "generally ships disabled" is based on, all of
the more recent SCSI drives (non SCA type though) I acquired came with
write cache enabled and some also with queue algorithm modifier set to 1.

It's a matter of enforcing write order. In how far such ordering
constraints are propagated by file systems, VFS layer, down to the
hardware, is the grand question.
