You are right, but it wasn't introduced in -mm or sched-domains
patches. However, one of Ingo's recent patches does balance on
exec for SMP, not just NUMA so it will make this more common.
So, Rusty has to fix it ;)
I think a rwsem might be a good idea anyway, because
sched_migrate_task can end up being called pretty often with
balance on exec and balance on clone. The semaphore could easily
place undue serialisation on that path.

Yes you are correct.
Can we arrange some of these checks to disappear when HOTPLUG_CPU
is not set? For example, make cpu_is_offline only valid to call for
CPUs that have been online sometime, and can evaluate to 0 if
HOTPLUG_CPU is not set?
