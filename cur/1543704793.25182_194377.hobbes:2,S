The trivial usage is to take the cpucontrol sem (down_cpucontrol()).
There's a grace period between taking the cpu offline and actually
killing it too, so for most usages RCU is sufficient.
Fortunately, I've yet to hit a case where this isn't sufficient.  For
the scheduler there's an explicit "move all tasks off the CPU" call
which takes the tasklist lock and walks the tasks.
Cheers,
Rusty.
