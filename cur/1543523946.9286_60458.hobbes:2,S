	Your reasoning is not at fault, it's your premise.  It's just that
a lot of us (I won't say all of us) who actually have responsibilities for
larger address spaces (I have a /16 plus ISS has a /19, two /20s and a /21
in the corporation), and have to run them, consider the non-CIDR case to be
either a "legacy" situation, an annoyance at best, or an excuse by vendors
for why their routers #$@$#@ up at worse.  It really ends up boiling down
to netmask and netmask and netmask and nothing much else.  Class A, Class B,
and Class C degenerate into nothing more than the DEFAULT initial netmasks
(/8, /16, and /14 respectively) to be modified by appropriate routing
tables and configurations.  I have lots of networks where I see the
"illegal" one bit wide subnet masks.  Those restrictions from RFC 1122 are
largely meaningless in a CIDR world.
	To paraphrase uncounted paraphrases of a paraphrase of an
expression...
	There are two classes of networks...
	Those that are CIDR and those that will be CIDR.  The "non-CIDR
case" is a non-op in the real world of the current internet.
	Hmmm...  That may be a BIT strong...  Non-CIDR can interact with
the core internet.  It's not a non-op per se...  It's much more of a pain
in the fanny than a non-op.
