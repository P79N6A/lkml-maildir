I do the sign extension with tiny stubs in arch/sparc64/kernel/sys32.S
so that the arg frobbing does not consume a stack frame, which is what
happens if you do this in C code.
We need to revisit this at some point and make a way for all
compat platforms to do this with a portable table of some kind
that expands a bunch of macros defined by the platform.
