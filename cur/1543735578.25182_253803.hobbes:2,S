Many thanks for detailed explanation. And, since char-major aliases 
don't work with udev anyway, and net-pf aliases are easy to enumerate 
and preload by parsing /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.alias, I think 
that udev users are ready to handle the fallout of this patch.

Implementation of various logical primitives. E.g., I use GPRS and want 
to start pppd during the boot process (i.e., an always-on link), but 
after the following things:
1) /dev/ttyS0 has been created
2) /dev/ppp has been created
3) modules for line disciplines and PPP compression have been preloaded 
(e.g. by grepping modules.alias for tty-ldisc and ppp-compress) and are 
ready for use by pppd
4) firewall rules have been applied
How to "AND" these things together in a /etc/dev.d scriptlet?
