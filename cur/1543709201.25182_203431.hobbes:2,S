No, I obviously was ambiguous.  I use:
export HISTFILE=~/.bash_history_${USER}_$(tty|sed s_^/dev/__|tr / _)
in my ~/.bashrc to ensure that each term has a unique and repeatable
HISTFILE.  I do not see any alternative tuple that is unique and
repeatable.
This change makes that idiom useless, with no alternative available.
On a multi-user server the change is clearly the right thing to do,
but on a workstation, laptop or handheld, where few ptys are typically
allocated, the case isn't so clear.
