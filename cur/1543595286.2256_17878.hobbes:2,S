No, it's a bad idea to test the error from devfs_register() unless you
*really* have a good reason. Most people who think they have a good
reason actually don't, they're just confused :-)
The reason you don't want to test the return value is that way the
driver works fine with CONFIG_DEVFS=n. Otherwise, you have a driver
that doesn't work with devfs, or you have to put ugly #ifdef's in the
code.
