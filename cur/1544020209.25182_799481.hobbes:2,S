looks good, but could you please do this like you did the previous one: 
i.e. against your previous tree which was against Linus's tree?
The tree you did above includes a ton of other in-work trees that are in 
-tip, which orders your fixes to after those trees - i.e. to somewhere in 
the late 2.6.30 merge cycle.
So it's better to keep these separate. You can do this by basing your tree 
on tip:core/header-fixes:
   git checkout -b my-new-tree tip/core/header-fixes
That will give you a base of your previous tree (in a Git friendly way), 
plus Sam's fix.
Then you can git-cherry-pick all your new commits into that new tree, and 
send a pull request if you are happy with it. Likewise, you can probably 
achieve the same (with a lot less work) by doing this in your master 
branch above:
   git rebase --onto tip/core/header-fixes tip/master
(this assumes you have -tip set up as a remote repository.)
