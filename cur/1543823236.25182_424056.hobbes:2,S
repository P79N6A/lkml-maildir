I don't think so.  Without some kind of limits, it is simple for an
unprivileged user process to cause the kernel to allocate huge wads of
memory and thereby DoS or accidentally OOM the machine.
The test in question should probably be fixed, but this is a much more
fundamental problem.  I don't have any specific opinions on what should
be done about it, other than "something".
