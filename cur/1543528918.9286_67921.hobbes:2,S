   IMHO it would.
   The difficulty is that several of the drivers support more than one bus.
Some of the combinations that I think I've seen are:
ISA only
PCI only
EISA only
MCA only
ISA and PCI
EISA and PCI
MCA and PCI
EISA, MCA and PCI
   So it would be necessary to go through each driver and check which
busses it supports.
