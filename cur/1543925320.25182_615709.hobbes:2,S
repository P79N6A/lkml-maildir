I tried to ensure that my cleanup patches do not make the 32 and 64 bit 
versions more different.
And e.g. in this case the kprobe_handler() and post_kprobe_handler() 
statifications remove the cosmetic difference of the 64bit ones not 
being static.  ;-)
Anyway, if any or all of my patches conflict with any other work simply 
ignore them and I'll resend them after 2.6.25-rc1 (if they still both 
apply and make sense).
