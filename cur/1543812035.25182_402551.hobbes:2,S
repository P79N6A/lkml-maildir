Okay, I've hit this same problem (but in a slightly different way) with
mmci.c.  The way I'm proposing to fix this for mmci is to introduce a
new capability which says "clustering is supported by this driver."
I'm unconvinced that we can safely fiddle with the queue's flags once
the queue is in use, hence why I've gone for the init-time only solution.
Maybe Jens can comment on that?
(The side effect of this patch is that everyone ends up with clustering
disabled until they explicitly update their driver to enable it - which
results in us defaulting to a safe operation mode.)
