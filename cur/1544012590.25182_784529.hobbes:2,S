This makes the whole thing unworthwhile.  The vmload/vmsave pair costs 
only 200 cycles (I should have started with this), and 120 cycles on the 
heavyweight path plus complexity are not worth 200 cycles on the 
lightweight path.

I have a truly marvellous patch that fixes the bug which this
signature is too narrow to contain.
