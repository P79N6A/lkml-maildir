Subject: [PATCH,TRIVIAL] AF_UNIX, accept() and addrlen

Hello,
Accept and getpeername are supposed to return the amount of bytes
written in the returned address.  However, on unnamed sockets, only
sizeof(short) is returned, while a 0 is put in the sun_path member.
This patch adds 1 for that additional byte.
