That should definately not happen.  Something has gone wrong in
mrlock.h if so - or it could be the incore xfs_inode has been
trampled on, and the mrlock writer state has become inappropriately
set.. that would cause the wrong branch to be taken and we'd end
up with the situation you've described here.
