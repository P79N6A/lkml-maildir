Actually you have a very diferent CPU to memory bandwidth ratio than a
processor manufactured in this millenium. I use a system like that for
test, but please don't optimize for it!
Speculation of the day: I suspect that on some laptops which run
seriously slower when on battery, the CPU/memory speed changes enough
that you could see and measure better performance with a 'slow' and a
'fast' kernel.
Speculation, since I'm sure the gain would be down in the noise, one of
those 'difference without a distinction' things.
