The shared mem count is set to zero by si_meminfo() in
arch/i386/mm/init.c  which is the function called to fill
in all the values that "free" and /proc/meminfo displays.
The si_meminfo() in the other arch's does fill in the value;
it's only left zero'd out in X86.  i guess they'll get
around to fixing that.

void si_meminfo(struct sysinfo *val)
{
	val->totalram = totalram;
	val->sharedram = 0;
	val->freeram = nr_free_pages << PAGE_SHIFT;
	val->bufferram = atomic_read(&buffermem);
	return;
