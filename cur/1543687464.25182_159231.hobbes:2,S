Subject: [PATCH] Allow either tid or pid in SCM_CREDENTIALS struct ucred

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
Could you stick this in -mm and see if anyone complains?  It fixes an
apparent bug in the validation of the SCM_CREDENTIALS structure in a
unix-domain socket sendmsg().
I found this because with Valgrind, the sendmsg call is being done in a
different thread from the one which did a getpid() to fill out the
SCM_CREDENTIALS structure, which causes the kernel to fail the sendmsg
with EPERM.  In the general case, this would cause a multithreaded
program sending messages with SCM_CREDENTIALS to appear schizophrenic to
a recipient, because every message would have a different pid depending
on which thread happened to send it.
If you use SCM_CREDENTIALS with a unix domain socket, and you're
non-root, then the kernel double-checks the values you supply for pid,
uid and gid in struct ucred.  In the case of uid or gid, it allows any
of effective, saved or real uid/gid.  In the case of pid, it only allows
current->pid, which is actually the tid.
This patch also makes it accept tgid in the SCM_CREDENTIALS pid field. 
That is, a threaded program can either supply the ID of the whole
process (tgid) or a particular thread (pid).  
Thanks,
	J
