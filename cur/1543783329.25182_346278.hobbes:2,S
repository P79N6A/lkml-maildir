That just rather suggests that the pthread API is broken as usual.

So setup a timer that goes off at that time and interrupts the operation. 
There is no need to overload the operation itself with an overly complex 
timeout specification.

That would make a rather useless CLOCK_MONOTONIC. The basic problem is 
that it would be very hard to specify the time without exactly knowing 
it's frequency, the larger the time difference the larger the time skew 
would be compared to CLOCK_REALTIME and without an atomic clock in your 
computer you have no way of knowing which one is "real".
So in practice it's easier to advance CLOCK_MONOTONIC/CLOCK_REALTIME 
equally and only apply time jumps to CLOCK_REALTIME.
