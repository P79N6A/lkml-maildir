Because it doesn't affect what happens in /proc/sys !
Strategy routines only affect sys_sysctl.
As strategy routines I have no real problems with them.

Exactly.   I have a patch I will be sending out shortly that
make sys_sysctl a compile time option (so we can seriously start killing it)
and it compiles out the strategy routines and /proc/sys still works :)
