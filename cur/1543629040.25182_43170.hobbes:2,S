Use readl/writel, that's why they exist.

They'll give you little endian always (i.e. they byteswap on big endian 
archs), so normally (register accesses) you shouldn't need additional 
swapping.

I don't think mb() will help you. You're probably experiencing PCI posting 
problems - when a writel() has executed, that doesn't necessarily mean 
that the transaction has actually happened it may (and will) be buffered 
for a potentially long time.
However, PCI won't reorder reads vs. writes, so you when you want to be 
sure that a write() actually reached the hardware, do a dummy read() 
afterwards, that'll flush the write buffer.
