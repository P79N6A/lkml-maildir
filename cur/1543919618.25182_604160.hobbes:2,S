It's not. Not in the cases where it is explicitly allowed and actively
exploited (loads passing stores), but most definitely not distinctly
visible in errata cases that have slipped through all the V&V.

Yes: it isn't the explicitly allowed reorderings that we care
about here (because obviously we're retaining the barriers for those).
It would be cases of bugs in the CPUs meaning they don't follow the
standard. But how far do you take your mistrust of a CPU? You could
ask gcc to insert locked ops between every load and store operation?
Or keep it switched off to ensure no bugs ;)

Firstly, while it can be possible to write a code to show up reordering,
it is really hard (ie. impossible) to guarantee no reordering happens. For
example, it may have only showed up on SMT+SMP P4 CPUs with some obscure
interactions between threads and cores involving more than 2 threads.
Secondly, even if we were sure that no current implementations reordered
loads, we don't want to go outside the bounds of the specification
because we might break on some future CPUs. This isn't a big performance
win.

Yes, but that's the same way I feel after reading *any* legal "information" ;)
