Hello,
> Can I take code coverage of a linux driver?
There is the GCC GNU coverage facility (GCOV) that may be exploited for this 
purpose. To use it with the kernel, get and apply the GCOV kernel patch 
(gcov-kernel.tar.gz) which may be found in the "files" section at:
  
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lse
There's also an extension for the text-only output of GCOV available which 
builds on the mentioned kernel patch and provides an easy-to-use interface 
including HTML output, bar-graphs, browsable overview list, etc. It's called 
LCOV and can be found at:
  
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/lcov.php

  Peter Oberparleiter
