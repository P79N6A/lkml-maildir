The "plugin" (or rather conversion, routing and resampling) system in the 
OSS emulation can be turned off using the proc interface:
echo "soundmodem 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
echo "soundmodem 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0c/oss
Full documentation is available at:
linux/Documentation/sound/alsa/OSS-Emulation.txt
It's easy to remove the "additional" functionality, but I bet that we
find some users requesting it. Also, in time when the OSS emulation was 
designed, not all OSS applications had own resapling code.
