Perhaps in April 2005. And if I read
http://www.pro-linux.de/security/7043
 correctly it is unsupported
anyways (sorry, I can't find a date on that page).
ATM there are probably newer releases and I doubt that there are no
updates for the kernel (even Debian/Stable has them).

That's an unsolvable problem: You want a "stable" distribution from year
X to support hardware designed and built in the future.
And BTW perhaps it is enough to take the kernel RPM (+ plus a few of the
kernel-near ones - dependencies will probably tell you) from the most
recent SuSE and try that if you for whatever reason want to stay with
the above release.
