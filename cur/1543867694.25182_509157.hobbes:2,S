If EIOCBRETRY then generic_file_aio_write() will be recalled for the
same iocb.

EIOCBQUEUED or EIOCBRETRY does not lead to aio_complete() call:
        if (ret != -EIOCBRETRY && ret != -EIOCBQUEUED) {
                aio_complete(iocb, ret, 0);

But just reference count confusion was deleted by patch. Isn't it?

Sorry Leonid, this patch is not safe.
It returns -EIOCBRETRY without guaranteeing that kick_iocb() will be  
called.  This can lead to operations hanging, both AIO and calls that  
come through do_sync_{read,write}.
It overwrites -EIOCBQUEUED, leading to an aio_complete() while a  
retry is happening.  This can lead to reference count confusion.   
Double-frees, referencing freed memory, that kind of thing.  This  
isn't a new problem.  The current code that overwrites with -EIO has  
this problem.  But moving to -EIOCBRETRY does introduce new behaviour  
of aio_complete() and the retry path racing.
I'll have a candidate patch to address the problem of EIO being  
raised on the way back up from a path which has returned -EIOCBQUEUED.
