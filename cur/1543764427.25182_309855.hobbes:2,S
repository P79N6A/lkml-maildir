I just do not understand, what does netlink multicasting means
and how it is different from what we have now.
Currently we have group registratin in bind(), 
and then send data to the bound socket if it
has appropriate group.
Or should some error be propagated to the caller, 
if there is no appropriate listener?
Connector requires it's own registration technique for
1. hide all transport [netlink] layer from higher protocols which use
connector
2. create different group appointment for the given connector's ID
[it was different, now new group which is eqal to idx field is appointed
to 
the new callback]
3. provide more generic set of ids
