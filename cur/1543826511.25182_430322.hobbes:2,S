Btw, did kernel hackers consulted with Papua New Guinea or bloody
Russian laws? It is possible that they have a law which forbids to write 
open source code. So we should stop Linux kernel development and completely 
remove it's sources from the Internet ASAP.
P.S. It is explicitly permitted to make reverse engineering in Russia.
