I'm not looking for "exact right".  I'm looking for "in the ballpark".  Hell,
I'm not even that picky.  "In the right country" will do for me.  But right
now, what I'm seeing, is a vm that will trigger the oom_killer with 900Mb of a
1GB machine used for nothing but disk cache.
Now, I wouldn't bring this up as a big issue except I keep seeing people say
things like "why so complex a solution for something that is only used in
emergency situations".  My point is that it *IS NOT* being using only in
emergency situations and that is what needs fixed.  Now, I'm willing to allow
that our internal kernel may trigger an oom at different times than the kernel
you use.  That's why I asked what kernel you want me to test in order to
establish whether or not I'm right about how far off the oom_killer trigger
really is.
