But the point is exactly that adeos is not a real-time operating
system.  It is not an operating system at all.
Besides, adeos is not a "circumvention device" to run RT-and-non-RT at
the same time.  It's a nano-kernel meant to run several independent OS's
at once, as well as kernel debuggers and a lot of other stuff. Did you
notice Karim is the author and maintainer of the linux trace toolkit?

I'll quote the patent for you:
   A process for [...]  providing a general purpose operating system as
   one of the non-real time tasks; preempting the general purpose
   operating system as needed for the real time tasks; and preventing the
   general purpose operating system from blocking preemption of the
   non-real time tasks.
Nothing of this is in adeos. And nothing of this will be in the
adeosized RTAI.
