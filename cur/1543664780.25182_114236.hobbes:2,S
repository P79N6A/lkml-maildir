Huh? After a glance at the code I agree that drivers_suspend happens before
count_and_copy_data_pages, but that means hitting the BUG_ON in
idedisk_suspend before the panic in count_and_copy_data_pages is what I'd
expect. How is that remarkable? ... My current kernel has HIGHMEM enabled,
but previous ones that failed the same way didn't.
Anyway, a few more tests showed that hdparm -u1 helps if I have lots of
memory used (say for fs caches). In two out of two tests, I saw Pavel's
request to send him 1 GB RAM via email.
Suspending directly from a clean boot (after issuing the same hdparm -u1
commands for both disks) I hit the BUG_ON in idedisk_suspend (two out of
two tests, too).
