And apps that were written before they were available? :)  We're OK with
their behaviour changing under newer kernels because they now have a
previous source of memory pressure that they didn't have before?
It seems a bit much to suggest that retaining the previous behaviour of
avoiding memory pressure by using the O_DIRECT API is somehow "pushing
bits of oracle into the core vfs" :).
Maybe that aspect of the API was unintentional, though.  That would be a
shame.  I suspect Oracle isn't alone in relying on it.

So now apps always have to pay the cost of looking up pages to
invalidate on the off chance that they wrote to a sparse region, based
on the current implementation detail that sparse regions fall back to
buffered?
