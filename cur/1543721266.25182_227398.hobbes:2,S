Here:
Finding objects, 1285 objects, ignoring 386 module(s)
Finding conglomerates, ignoring 61 conglomerate(s)
Scanning objects
Error: ./drivers/serial/8250_pnp.o .data refers to 0000000000000020 
REFQUAD           .exit.text
Done
So, is this an ISAPNP thing?  My .config is attached (compressed).  I 
turned off ISAPNP and am running make on it again right now.
