  I am having problems here, I built the 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 kernels in a
normal fashion and get a "no setup signature found" when I reboot.  I
haven't encountered this on the other 2 systems I have upgraded, which are
built similarly.  The only difference is that this is an OC'd K6-2
333->350. All are running a current Redhat 5.2.  Any ideas?
Thanks,
Andrew
