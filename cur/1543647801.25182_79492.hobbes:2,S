If half-arsed stuff is going to get merged just to beat the freeze,
maybe it should go in with the constraint "get it cleaned by xxx
or it gets dropped".
Personally, I agree with Greg, and that it should get fixed up
_before_ the freeze. Fixing this up to work with subarch's shouldn't
take *that* long, and there's *counts* a whole week remaining before
Linus goes on hols 8-)
