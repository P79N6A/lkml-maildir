Because it's a premature optimization.  We can add it later if someone
proves it's a major hotspot.  But it may turn out some other primitive
is more important: I'm not smart enough to know.

Yep.

Oops.... Fixed by moving the uwaitq_add above the again: label.

Yep.

Yes.  My prior implementation actually deleted the sleeper from the
queue on wakeup, making it easy to detect and also saving a syscall.
I'm leaning towards the "flag" idea now though.

Yes.  The problem is: how many?  Each one takes memory and (as you
point out) pinned pages (although this could be changed with some loss
of simplicity).  An arbitrary limit smacks of SysV IPC: a sure sign of
bad taste.  So for the moment, the limit is 1.
