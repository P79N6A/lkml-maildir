Um, but that's why even Solaris's openat(2) proposal doesn't expose
streams or extended attributes as "normal files".  The answer is that
you can't just expose named streams or extended attributes as "normal
files" without screwing yourself.
Also, I haven't checked to see what Solaris does, but technically
their UFS implementation does actually use separate inodes for their
named streams, so stat(2) could return separate inode numbers for the
named streams.  (In fact, if you take a Solaris UFS filesystem with
extended attributs, and run it on a Solaris 8 fsck, the directory
containing named streams/extended attributes will show up in
lost+found.)
