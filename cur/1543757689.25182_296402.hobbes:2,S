Hello All,
I'm having some trouble in getting the number of disk blocks
read/written per second.  I found the link on /proc/diskstats but I
don't see that parameter somewhere.  If there's a way to get the
number, it'd be great.  Otherwise some cursory advice, pointer to more
links would be fine.
Thanks very much,
