I have a similar setup here; 250Gb on an Oxford922 doing nightly
backups via rsync. Athlon mainboard with VIA chipset. ieee1394,
ohci1394, sbp2 as modules. I get seemingly random crashes that
freeze the system solid, no oopses. Sometimes I get a few of these:
Jun 13 06:12:14 chewbaka kernel: ieee1394: sbp2: aborting sbp2 command
Jun 13 06:12:14 chewbaka kernel: Write (10) 00 00 89 4c 33 00 00 08 00 
but I can't decide if this is related.
If I unplugg the drive and then re-plugg it, the failure is
easiy reproduced with some heavy disk activity (copying a file-
system to the firewire disk for example).
Any idea about where to start looking? I have tried various
options for sbp2 in /etc/modprobe.conf. Let me know if you
want my .config etc.
Thanks,
Hans
