hmm, what about making all those something like:
	ide=3:foo,bar;4:wossname
where ':' and ';' are arbitrarily chosen atm ...
or, if it should be handled at the 'argument' level
maybe the 'notion' of arrays would help, something
like
	ide[3]=foo,bar
where ide is defined as array of strings, size 16
best,
