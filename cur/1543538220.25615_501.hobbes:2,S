     If the location of buffers isn't fixed, then it makes the problem very
difficult.  I realize for all practical purposes, with a given compiler and
loader they are essentially fixed.
     After looking at safelib a bit though, I agree with others that it's the
best prevention if it can be made portable.

     Stackguard is presently limited to x86 and presently implimented only for
an old version of gcc; so it's only a partial solution for the x86 platform
only if you're willing to use antique tools. 
     But beyond that, I don't like to rely on one layer of security; it is
desirable to have multiple layers.  What makes stackguard and non-executable
user stack area mutually exclusive?  What makes either of those things and
safelib mutually exclusive?
     And as I previously mentioned, a lot of other functionality in the patch
has value; even if it breaks POSIX rules (and I'm sorry if I'm speaking
blasphemly in front of those who bow down and worship the POSIX god's).
It's a configuration option.  But I also understand Linus reluctance to have
a lot of ifdef's in the code; it makes it impossible to figure out what code
was actually compiled in and executed when something goes wrong.
     As I stated early on though, this is a more minor issue; the patch is
well maintained and documented, easily to apply, so it's no big deal with each
new release.  The low latency patch is another matter.  But I fully realize
that it has no chance of being included.
     I don't know how to go about making the measurements people want to
justify whether a schedualing point is needed.  As I stated previously, I'd be
happy to do so if it's something I can physically do but I don't have hardware
sitting idle here that I can take down and do kernel profiling, etc.
