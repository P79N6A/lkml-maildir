This won't be reasonable until its performance improves drastically, 
especially if you're going to emulate multiple machines.  Grab the code and 
run it, and you'll see what I mean.

Due to its performance, this might not be the best advertisement in the world 
for Linux.  Also, the target OS needs something very similar to clone, plus a 
pretty general mmap.  As far as I'm aware, even most Unices don't qualify.
