Subject: [PATCH 0/3] fixes for overflow in poll(), epoll(), and msec_to_jiffies()

Hello,
After the discussion around epoll() timeout, I noticed that the functions used
to detect the timeout could themselves overflow for some values of HZ.
So I decided to fix them by defining a macro which represents the maximal
acceptable argument which is guaranteed not to overflow. As an added bonus,
those functions can now be used in poll() and ep_poll() and remove the divide
if HZ == 1000, or replace it with a shift if (1000 % HZ) or (HZ % 1000) is a
power of two.
Patches against 2.6.14-rc2-mm1 sent as replies to this mail.
Regards,
Willy
