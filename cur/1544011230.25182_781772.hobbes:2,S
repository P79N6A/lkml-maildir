The kernel I'm currently using is an ad-hoc patchwork of changes to the 2.6.18 Xen Dom0 kernel that was available back in August.  The folks from OTC in Intel (Zhao Yu and his team) would be able to provide you more background on it as they did the work to enable MSI-X, SR-IOV and VT-d in that kernel so that my drivers would function.  I don't see Zhao Yu on the distro list for this email so I'll add him.
