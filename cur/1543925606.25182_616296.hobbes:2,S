Modifying the return address is analogous to how kretprobes are
implemented.

Thanks! Maybe it'll be useful if you could code this up as an
independent module and post it to lkml so others can use it? If its
deemed useful, we could add it to the kprobes samples/ modules.

I've heard of people doing things similar to what you've described. (I
think someone had also implemented a "hot-patching" mechanism too, using
kprobes).
