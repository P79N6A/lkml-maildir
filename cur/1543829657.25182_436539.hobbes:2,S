It depends on how often you expect unmounts to be happening, I suppose.

Well, all the roots are on the anon list, it's just that shrink_dcache_anon()
can't get rid of any root that's got children.
For unmounting specifically, we can do better as we can consume the dentry
trees directly.  That's not too difficult when we can unconditionally destroy
them from the leaves inwards.  That way we could probably avoid calling
shrink_dcache_parent() also - stick the tree at s_root on to the anon list
during unmount and have a single algorithm to wipe away the whole lot from
there.
