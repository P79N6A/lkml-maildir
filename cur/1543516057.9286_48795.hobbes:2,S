Becouse there is no gain in using ever single GNU "extension" out there:
1. They are non standard.
2. They are fluent withing versions of the progamms.
See for example just the problems with the binutils. Or better the
wonderfull incompatibilities between bash-1.14 and bash-2.0xx
Second it maybe desirable in esp. for embedded environments to make
the whole system as lean as possible and then... you certainly should
better
make a big circle around many of the GNU versions of the system tools.
