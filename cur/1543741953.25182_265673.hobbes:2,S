Indeed. But you hide this kind of information very carefully.
Announcing with a subject like this one isn't very descriptive.
Also the majority of kernel downloaders probably don't read lkml at
all. So how should they figure out?
It would be very helpful if you could please include at least your 
announcement in the changelog or some other file on kernel.org.
The changelog as of now is probably technically correct, but way to specific
and large for the average non kernel hacker - go ask someone who's happy
to get a kernel compiled by himself.
I don't care that much about the whole development model and the
numbering system as long as I can find the information above without 
reading hundreds of lkml lists daily. I guess most of the average users
out there would think alike. You just don't address them right now.

ps:
  using -rc suffix which everywhere else uses for release candidate
  isn't a good choice. The -pre and -rc known from earlier kernels were
  much more intuitive. Personally I'd even prefer something like
  x.y.LATEST - x.y.LATEST-test{1,2..} - x.y.NEXT-rc{1,2,..} - x.y.NEXT
