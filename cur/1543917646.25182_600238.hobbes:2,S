So if I design a mobile phone and want the user to be able to listen to
music and to browse the web and use the camera, I must
- allocate the web cache on start
- allocate the mp3 cache on start
- allocate the video/photo buffer on start
- leave enough RAM for other applications
- waste much of the memory most of the time
- reduce the capabilities of the camera in order to reduce used memory
  (e.g. reduce the video resolution to match the slow flash speed instead
   of allowing short high-res clips or reduce the number of pictures for
   automatic sequences)
- costly reload parts of web pages that could have been stored in 
  the currently unused RAM
- increase the realtime constraints of the mp3 player in order to
  conserve memory, making the music stutter while performing
  other operations.
instead of just telling the system "Hey' I'm the web browswer, I need
2 MB of RAM to work correctly, 4 MB to show a nice performance and
if you ask me nicely, I'll release memory", because nobody could possibly
want this feature?
IMO, even desktop systems would perform better having this feature.

Yeah, you should know all apllications your users will put on their phones!

The system should notify the applications before reaching that point,
e.g. when the cache is reduced below a theresold.

And it's easy to limit the size and number of images on web pages
that need to be cached.

Knowing one's memory usage - possibly not counting stack, code and data,
is only half of the trick. You need to know the current memory pressure,
too.
Imagine mozilla asks if it may use the whole lotta 4 GB RAM for it's memory
cache, and it may. The user is stupid enough to download an 2,3 GB ISO, save
it, burn it, deletes the file, finds out the disc was damaged and reloads
it - not from the net, but from the RAM cache. User is happy.
Now the user starts a game, the game would need 2 GB of RAM, and either
mozilla or the game is killed. User is unhappy. But if the system does
not kill one of them, but nicely asks mozilla to free 2 GB of RAM, the
user will not be able to reload the ISO from RAM, but being able to still
use the browser while pausing the game, he won't care.
I'm not arguing on how this should be implemented, but if and why it should
be implemented. Maybe it's as simple as having a signal each second if the
cache is below x MB, maybe you'll want a memory manager helper application
in userspace. Maybe you want both options ... or something completely
different. But without kernel support, it won't work as well as it could.
