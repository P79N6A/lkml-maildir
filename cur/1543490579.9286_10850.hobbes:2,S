How about this:
$ ./script
bash: ./script: No such file or directory
$ head -1 script
#!/usr/bin/foo
$ foo script
Running script...
This is a userland problem, not a kernel issue. I'm not aware of ANY
interpreter that doesn't work the way you would expect by simply passing
the name of the script as an argument to the interpreter.
