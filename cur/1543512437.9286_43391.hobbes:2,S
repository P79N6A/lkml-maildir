Hold on. In swap_out_mm() you have to protect find_vma() (OK, it doesn't
block, but we'll have to take care of mm->mmap_cache) _and_ you'll have to
protect vma from destruction all way down to try_to_swap_out(). And to
vma->swapout(). Which can sleep, so spinlocks are out of question here.
I still think that just keeping a cyclic list of pages, grabbing from that
list before taking mmap_sem _if_ we have a chance for blocking
__get_free_page(), refilling if the list is empty (prior to down()) and
returning the page into the list if we didn't use it may be the simplest
way.
