umm, that's the best-case.  We also care about worst-case.  Think:
1,000,000 inodes on inode_unused, of which a randomly-sprinkled 10,000 are
from the being-unmounted filesytem.  The code as-proposed will do 100x more
work that it needs to do.  All under a global spinlock.

What's this about "the page dirty ratio may not pass the threshold to
trigger VM reclaim logic"?  Page reclaim isn't triggered by a dirty page
ratio.
Page reclaim is triggered by a shortage of free pages.  And page reclaim is
supposed to reclaim unused inodes in an orderly and balanced fashion.  It
appears that it's not doing so in your case and we'd need to see more
details (please) so we can understand why it is not working.
You're proposing that we not do any of that and that the filesytem be able
to call into a VM memory reclaim function for not-clearly-understood
reasons.  This is a workaround.
Please help us to understand what has gone wrong with inode reclaim.  And
please see if you can find time to help us with this rather than adding
some RH-specific fix and then forgetting about it (sensible though that
approach would be...)
Thanks.
