My point was that a recompile is fine.  Breaking the *source* interface is 
problematic.  (For those who fear that source compatibility can lead to 
binary compatibility and dislike the latter:  you can make source-compatible 
changes that break binary conpatibility, the most obvious being rearranging 
structure elements.)
The main thing I draw from your example is that nobody garbage-collected 
smap in a timely fashion.  Announce the old interface's deprecation in the 
(stable) release where the new interface first shows up, and then *remove* 
it at the next major release.
Widely distributed development has its drawbacks; this is one of them.  It 
would be nice if we dealt with it semi-sanely.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
