seems now i got it **pretty** fixed.
what i did:
1) updated kernel to 2.6.14-git4
2) setted 100Hz instead of 250
3) setted latency to 0x40 (64) instead of old 0x20 (32)
4) disabled pci 2.1 in my bios.
i summed all solutions proposed by you all.
it seems much much better, even if problem is not completly disappeared.
i still get some ZzZ sounds, but they're so few i can declare problem fixed.
i'm gonna set fixed status to kernel and alsa bugzilla too.
Next step will be trying to get back to 250hz.
Thanks for all your help
