Why does it matter?  The point is that a tivoizer *could* do that.

Are you claiming Google is tivoizing something in their internal
infrastructure?  They're not distributing or conveying that software,
so, nothing wrong with that.
Or are you talking about their search appliance, which I know nearly
nothing about?

  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
  functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
  interfered with solely because modification has been made.

TiVo did not sell me that off-the-shelf PC with the Free Software in
it.  It (hypothetically) sold me a computer with technical measures
meant to restrict my ability to adapt the software it shipped to my
own needs and to run it for any purpose, while it can still do that.
That's a difference.

Intent behind this?: weasel out of the obligations of the license.
Anyone, probably even a US court, might very well see it that way.
They retain the ability to modify the software, so they ought to pass
it on to the user.
