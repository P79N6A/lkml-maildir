well, it's only a hack and emulated: SCHED_ISO in CFS is recognized as a 
policy but it falls back to SCHED_NORMAL. Could you check how well this 
(i.e. SCHED_NORMAL) works for your workload, compared to SD's SCHED_ISO? 
If you'd like to increase the priority of a task, i'd suggest to use 
negative nice levels. (use the 'nice' option in 
/etc/security/limits.conf with a newer version of PAM to allow 
unprivileged users to use negative nice levels.)
