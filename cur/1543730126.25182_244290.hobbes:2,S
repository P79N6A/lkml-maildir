Mine is a Geforce FX (Toshiba Satellite M30), and Xorg (Fedora Core 2)
works (sort of). I don't see any use for 3D on a laptop, so just 2D is no
problem to me. But I haven't been able to get 1280x800 working right (it
does a distorted 1024x768), so I use nVidia's driver (which has its own
problems, if you install it for one kernel it breaks for the others).
