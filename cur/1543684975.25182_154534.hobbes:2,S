You're right. In my PC, with just one CPU, it doesn't make a difference
:-)
Anyway, I took a look at the workqueue code and looks like I only need a
"create_workqueue()" that only creates one thread. This is what
create_workqueue_thread() does, but it's static. Oh, well. I can also
destroy all threads but one or, as you say, write my own code. I have to
think about it....
