In fact, you don't need the cfag12864b display, as the driver just
needs the parallel port for output (you can put some LEDs attached to
the parallel port to check the driver's operations and it will be
fine).
BTW, why ks0108 didn't find the 888 parallel port? Haven't you got such number?

Sure, that won't be a problem; however, maybe there is other better way (?).
