Hi.
First of all: A happy new year in advance!
Now to my question:
In the kernel-configuration there are the two options:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640        CMD640 chipset bugfix/support
and
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000        RZ1000 chipset bugfix/support
At least the second of those two seems to cause some little slowdown 
("This may slow disk throughput by a few percent, but at least things 
will operate 100% reliably.").
1) Is the bigfixing code only activated when a buggy chipset is detected 
or do I even have a slowdown with proper a properchipset?
2) Can some help me to find out if my system has one of those two 
chipsets. This might be a dumb question but I'm not sure if 
CMD640/RZ1000 are only some little IDE controller chipsets or if they 
were some kind of Southbridge/Nortbridge.
If got a Epox 8KTA2 mainboard (having VIA VT82C686A/B chipset).
Thanks in advance!
Greetings,
Christoph Anton Mitterer.
