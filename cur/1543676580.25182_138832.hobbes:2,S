    The 2GB limit is 100% userspace; distros are already shipping the
    mkswap(8) fixes (both RH & UL anyway).
If I recall things correctly: at some point in time
the kernel would reject a swapon on a swapspace that was
larger than it could handle (instead of just using the
initial part).
That is why mkswap contains a lot of very ugly code
that compares the size with the maximum certain kernels
will accept for swapon.
I have not checked recently what the present situation is.
