One question comes to my mind: Are patches supposed to be applied with
patch -p0 or patch -p1? 
AFAIU, the preferred way is -p1, but the above example would need -p0, if
I'm not mistaken. So that'ld make it harder than necessary to collect
patches and then apply the whole set, which seems to be Linus' preferred
way.
