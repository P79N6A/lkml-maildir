I don't think there's a lot of point playing with this in 2.4.x.  In
2.5 it depends a bit on what changes to the VFS happen.  I recall that
near the end of the 2.3 cycle Al Viro proposed a change to add
essentially a removepage operation (he called it detachpage IIRC) - he
was using it to eliminate a bunch of the "if (page->buffers)" tests.
I don't know it that's still on the cards - it so it could certainly
simplify both ramfs and shmfs.
