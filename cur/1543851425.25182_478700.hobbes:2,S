Ok, you are correct, for a stupid reason, this option didn't correctly
work for a range of device types (I can get into the gory details if
anyone really cares...)
I've now fixed this up, and a few other bugs that I kept tripping on
(which others also hit), and have refreshed my tree so that the next -mm
will be much better in this area.
If the problem persists (and I've built a zillion different kernels in
different configurations today testing to make sure it doesn't), please
let me know.
I can post updated patches here if people want them.
thanks for everyone's patience, I appreciated it.
