And, FWIW, let me assure you all that Thomas Richter does indeed 
understand what he is talking about.  He almost single-handedly 
brought the still broken AmigaOS3.1 into the modern age of being able 
to use hard drives of any size.  His work on the amiga's long after 
commode door took the money and ran to the bahamas will be forever 
appreciated by the remaining users of this once fine machine.  
Unforch, that leaves me out as a failing hard drive wrecked quite a 
bit of my once awesome system.  And thats when I discovered that the 
backup programs, regardless of what you paid for it, were worthless 
as they were not able to backup any file with an open lock on it, eg 
anything that was running.  Rather hard to restore the system when 
the system itself is missing from the backups.
