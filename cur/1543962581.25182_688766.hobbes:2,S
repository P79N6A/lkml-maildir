I would bet this is the problem for the reporter.
I tried the same here, and cannot exhibit the problem. Just like the
reporter, my / is ro and /dev is rw :
# mkdir --version
mkdir (coreutils) 5.2.1
...
# uname -a
Linux alix-2C3 2.6.25-wt4-alix #3 Thu Apr 24 08:30:05 CEST 2008 i586 i586 i386 GNU/Linux
(this is essentially 2.6.25+squashfs+some geode patches)
# mount
/dev/sda4 on / type ext3 (ro,errors=continue,data=ordered)
/dev on /dev type tmpfs (rw,size=0k,nr_inodes=4096,mode=755)
# mkdir -p /dev/a/b/c
# ls -lad /dev/a/b/c
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 40 Jan  3 00:49 /dev/a/b/c/
# rmdir -p /dev/a/b/c
rmdir: `/dev': Read-only file system
# strace mkdir -p /dev/a/b/c
stat64("/dev/a/b/c", 0xbf9175dc)        = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
umask(0)                                = 022
open(".", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE|O_DIRECTORY) = 3
chdir("/")                              = 0
mkdir("dev", 0755)                      = -1 EEXIST (File exists)
stat64("dev", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=17080, ...}) = 0
chdir("dev")                            = 0
mkdir("a", 0755)                        = 0
chdir("a")                              = 0
mkdir("b", 0755)                        = 0
chdir("b")                              = 0
umask(022)                              = 0
mkdir("c", 0777)                        = 0
fchdir(3)                               = 0
close(3)                                = 0
