With same apm configuration in 2.2.13 it works.
IBM ThinkPad 380X2 APM Bios 1.2
apm -s suspends the machine, but it comes back with either a blank
screen and/or a dead keyboard.
I think that changes that went in with acpid screwed with the
interrupts.
CONFIG_PM=y
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
CONFIG_APM=m
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS=y
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set

I'll try test6-pre5 
test6-pre2/3 may have been corrupting memory, but test5 was otherwise
pretty solid for me.
