Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: Correct invalid assumptions in the Kconfig text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/23/174

From: Haavard Skinnemoen <hskinnemoen@atmel.com>
This patch corrects recently changed (and now invalid) Kconfig
descriptions for the DMA engine framework:
 - Non-Intel(R) hardware also has DMA engines;
 - DMA is used for more than memcpy and RAID offloading.
In fact, on most platforms memcpy and RAID aren't factors, and DMA
exists so that peripherals can transfer data to/from memory while
the CPU does other work.

This corrects a 'regression' of the Kconfig text that happened during
the 2.6.24 merge window.  Adrian was concerned that people were
needlessly turning this capability on without the requisite hardware,
but the wording is indeed misleading.
