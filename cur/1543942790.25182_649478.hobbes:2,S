FWIW this is not reproducible on 2.6.24/x86/CentOS-51. (I tried running 
it nearly 1500 times in a loop.) Assuming those many tries are sufficient 
to reproduce this bug, there seems to be something specific to the 
environment/architecture/configuration that's necessary to trigger it. 
It might be helpful to provide full details like glibc version, compiler 
version, .config etc.
