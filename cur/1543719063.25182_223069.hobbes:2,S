No.  Something will be terminated, not necessarily the "evil"
process. A runaway process can have quite a few server processes
killed before it eventually dies.   An attacker will of course
use processes that forks, so some remain and can keep
spending memory and process time.
ulimit is the way of limiting how much memory a user can use,
preventing this scenario.  Not setting up swap isn't.

Well, the process (or processes) can consume lots of cpu time
without swap too.  It can cause server processes to get killed (or
not get memory they need) and it can cause slowdowns ny
evicting nearly all program code from memory.

Definitely use ulimit on such a machine.
