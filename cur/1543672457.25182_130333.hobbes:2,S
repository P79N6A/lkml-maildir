If you build a kernel to run Linux drivers that seems to scream
derivative work to me.

At the very best support wise you would fall under the same category
as if you loaded a binary only driver.
On a very practical side you would suffer severe bitrot.  As I have
seen no project that has attempted this being able to keep up with 
the kernel API.  Netkit, Mach and MILO are good examples of why not to
do this.
