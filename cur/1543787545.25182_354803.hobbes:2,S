Thanks for all the comments.  I just updated the KHGtG with the feedback 
I received.  Go to

Two items of note:

that's way too long and convoluted to deal with.  Once the 'git fetch 
--tags' changes make it into the official repository (are they there 
already?), I'll remove all the remaining direct references to running rsync.
2) What is the easiest way to obtain a list of changes present in 
repository B, that are not present in repository A?  I used to use 
git-changes-script [hacked cg-log script] for this:
	$ cd /repo/netdev-2.6
	$ git-changes-script -L ../linux-2.6
would display all changes in /repo/netdev-2.6 which are not present in 
/repo/linux-2.6.  This is similar to 'git log master..HEAD', except for 
repositories rather than branches.
