Well I wasn't serious about this submission thing precisely
for the above reasons. From long past times I can remember
that those beasts could be configured to have A B C D or whichever
ports, which could be neraly infinitely permuted to provide
many not usefull combinations of 4 or 8 bit bus buffers.
The externall visible register address or data lines where very
likely to be permutted between the chip and the data part of the ISA bus,
just becouse the layouter of the card did feel like beeing creative.
(So even register values won't help you!)
And last but not least they could be coupled in bunches.
So the chances for a genrically usefull driver are indeed not big.
And last but not least: The source for a driver for a 1.0.xx kernel
isn't very usefull nowadays.
And admittedly, well most lekely I don't have the code around
any longer... but it was just about 400 lines I can remember.
