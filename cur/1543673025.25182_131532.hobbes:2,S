That's the opposite of my Toshiba in any of the lower power modes.
When there's CPU activity, it emits a quiet high-pitched noise.  When
CPU activity stops, the noise stops.  This doesn't happen in the
maximum power usage mode (brigh screen, fastest clock), and I don't
know if there's a way to turn it off.
