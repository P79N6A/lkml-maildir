Subject: mirror causes oops in 2.3.15pre3 (followup)

A couple of details to add to my previous report:
1.  The oops is repeatable in 2.3.15 final.
2.  The oops is apparently caused when the root user makes an ftp
connection.  Regular users can initiate an ftp connection with no
problem, but root consistently causes an oops.  Since mirror is run as
root, that is  apparently the point at which mirror oopsed.  Hope this
helps.
