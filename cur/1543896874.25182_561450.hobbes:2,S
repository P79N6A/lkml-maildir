Hi Andi,
Yes, kdump kernel is generally <4GB . Won't I require IOMMU while I am 
copying the high memory contents in second kernel (lets say 16 GB of memory
and destination device is not capable of addressing anything more than 4G
for DMA operation)?

Will using IOMMU instead of swiotlb give noticeable perfomance boost.
One of the goals is to automatically save the crash dump as soon as
possible and boot back into production kernel to reduce system down
time and reduce availability.
Right now I am trvelling. After OLS will try to come up with a patch
for reserving a couple of IOMMU entries for kdump purposes. Only issue
is that any boot time reservation requirements make it impossible to
enable a feature at run time without rebooting the system.
Thanks
Vivek
