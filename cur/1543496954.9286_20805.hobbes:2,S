Yeah.  To all intents and purposes the only 26-bit machines that Linux is 
likely to ever run on are the Archimedes series, and they maxed out at 16MB.  
In theory you could have bolted more RAM on somehow, but with a 64MB maximum 
total address space this starts to get pretty hairy.

Actually I can't think of any technical reason it wouldn't work (each MEMC 
basically does its own thing anyway) but of course it's hard to imagine why 
anyone would want to do this. :-)
