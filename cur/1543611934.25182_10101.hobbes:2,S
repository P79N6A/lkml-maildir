I fixed the clocking issue in my source.  I need more details on the 
artsd problem though.  Does artsd start to work and then stop, or does 
it never get around to outputting any sound?  Also, do you have any of 
the debugging output turned on (it *drastically* changes the timings in 
the driver and can make things that normally work fail and vice versa)?
