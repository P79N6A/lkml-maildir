Those are not even valid states for devices. Device states are commonly 
D0-D3, though they are not represented the same way for all kinds of 
devices. 
Pavel is right, and we should be able to do that generically, though in a 
slightly different manner. We should have all devices save state, write 
the image, then power them down (including spinning down disks).
