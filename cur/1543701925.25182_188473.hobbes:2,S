Which bug is this?  Not updating use_sg, or mapping the command the
second time when it is retried?  If the latter, I don't think this is an
HBA bug.  The HBA driver doesn't know that the command has been mapped in
the past, so it will blindly map/unmap it again.

Can you point to the section of the document you believe applies?

But the sg list is no longer mapped.  The HBA driver did call pci_unmap_sg
on it.  Did you mean to say, "Never map an sg list again that has been
mapped in the past"?

The mid-layer doesn't map the list.  The HBA drivers do.  So you're saying
that either the mid-layer or the HBA drivers need to copy the list so it
can be restored just in case the command will be retried?
