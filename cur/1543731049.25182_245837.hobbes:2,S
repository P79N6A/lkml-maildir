Another example: Can ext2/etx3/reiserfsv3/xfs be implemented as reiser4
plugins? From Hans' words it seems so. If this is correct, then maybe
reiser4 core should be updated to completely replace current VFS layer?
Then it's a good point to create a branch (in old development model it
would be 2.7, dunno for new :), replace VFS layer with reiser4 core, and
rewrite all (or at least most used) FS as reiser4 plugins. Then
everybody will be happy.
But this looks too good to be true. Perhaps I misunderstood Hans' words
aboud 'new disk format', did I?
