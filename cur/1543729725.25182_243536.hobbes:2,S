Exactly.
Sending raw commands is _privileged_ operation.
Alan's example is invalid because IDE driver requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN and 
CAP_SYS_RAWIO so if there is some security risk involved - it is in the user 
apps not in the kernel.  Also Linus first fixed SG_IO correctly with 
requiring CAP_SYS_RAWIO but then (under Alan's influence?) he added filtering 
which broke cd writing and which is just unmaintainable.
Also filtering cannot work in all cases because there are vendor specific 
opcodes, some devices redefines some opcodes etc. - this should be left to 
user space.
