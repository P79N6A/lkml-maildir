So, by "what would ... give you", you meant what the benefits are?  I
was just clarifying how they work, I *thought* that's what you meant...

Why would it want to unzip the *same* file that many times?
If you're talking about nested zipfiles, we can do nested plugins just
as easily.

Tune the plugin, or use zip directly.  I'm not proposing necessarily to
embed zip in the kernel and drop it from userland, just to have a kernel
interface so that apps/people don't have to all know about the zip
program and how to use it.
Besides, in the zip example, I made very sure that unless you point a
program specifically at where the zip plugin unpacks stuff, you can
easily get the zipfile.
Of course, that could be turned on its head if it was more low-level
transparent compression, the kind where you just compress everything in
/etc because it's all tiny text files.  In that case, you would want a
setup where you have to work to get the raw data.  But in that case,
it's a different kind of plugin anyway -- a plugin for storing data,
rather than just accessing it.
Stop worrying about automagic stuff, though.  It won't trigger unless
you go looking for it.  It will just be easier to find if you do.

I said we already did, which is true.  I don't think I'm making these
up, I just don't remember where they were in Silent Semantic.
(oops, I fired the last one off before I was done...)
