Wouldn't it be better to see such things proven right in 2.5 first ?
Random things like this still appearing in 2.4 that haven't shown
up in 2.5 yet is a little disturbing. Ok its small, and there'll be
more 2.4pre's to get it right if anything is wrong with it, but
the whole forward-porting features thing just seems so... backwards.

Dave.
