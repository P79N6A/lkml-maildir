You sell the patent and all rights to an offshore company that does no
other work. They then sue you for violating the patent because you
"accidentally" forgot to keep your own rights, you settle and pay them
back the same amount of money they paid you, you claim tax breaks on the
resulting loss. 
Just spinning off a company in the modern day world is so tax
inefficient.
