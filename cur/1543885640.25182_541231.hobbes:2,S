If this is cache miss related then a larger page order may take are 
of this. Boot with (assume you got 2.6.21-mm1 at least...)
slub_min_order=6 slub_max_order=7
which will give you an allocation unit of 256k. Just tried it. It 
actually works but has no effect here whatsoever on UP netperf 
performance. netperf performance dropped from 6MB(slab)/6.2MB(slub) on 
2.6.21-rc7-mm1 to 4.5MB (both) on 2.6.21-mm1. So I guess there is 
something also going on with the networking layer.
Still have not found a machine here where I could repeat your 
results.
