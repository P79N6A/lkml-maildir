	No, I'm not saying that you shouldn't use configfs.  Greg is
more adamant than I, actually, on the "file == attribute" model.
	Here's the thing.  For most users, there is no reason they can't
use configfs for _config_ and something like netlink for bulk data
movement.  configfs isn't a kitchen sink, and it never should be.
	Now, I know that your group/pids list fits really nicely as a
concept in the configfs tree.  You certainly can't be calling a usermode
helper for each fork() and exit().  So this is why we're still having a
discussion and working on it.

	Fair enough, Cc'd!
