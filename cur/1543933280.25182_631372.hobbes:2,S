Then let's do it right:  disable mmconfig by default on x86, and enable 
it when passed "pci=mmconfig".
For the rare -- you and I agree its very rare -- case where it is 
REQUIRED, the user can pass pci=mmconfig as instructed by driver 
documentation somewhere.
Let's not bend over backwards and introduce an API for these 
presently-theoretical cases.  Given the complete lack of hw vendor 
testing and potential to confuse userspace, the two choices for a 
computer should be "mmconfig off" or "mmconfig on."
Kernel hackers developing drivers and code for new machines will know 
enough to pass pci=mmconfig if they NEED it.  That practice will only 
become annoying when x86 hardware actually starts to NEED extended 
config space -- at which future time we can revisit, as you describe.

Yes, we /must/ do this checking, if we don't already.
