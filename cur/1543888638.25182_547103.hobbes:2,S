No. It's mostly a response to Dmitry's suggestion. I've done all of
the benchmark/testcase-writing on mainline.

This looks like you've repaired the slow convergence issue mainline
has by other means.

I found that mainline actually converges to the evenly-split shares of
CPU bandwidth, albeit incredibly slowly. Something like an hour is needed.

This is close enough to Libenzi's load generator to mean this particular
issue is almost certainly fixed.

I have other, more difficult to pass testcases. I'm giving up on ipopt
for the quadratic program associated with the \ell^\infty norm and just
pushing out the least squares solution since LAPACK is standard enough
for most people to have or easily obtain.
A quick and dirty approximation is to run one task at each nice level in
a range of nice levels and see if the proportions of CPU bandwidth come
out the same on SMP as UP and how quickly they converge. The testcase
is more comprehensive than that, but it's easy enough of a check to see
if there are any issues in this area.
