Subject: Xen VMM patch set - take 3

We didn't get much feedback from take 2, so hopefully we're
converging on something that's acceptable. The only major
difference between this set and the previous is the way we handle
the /dev/mem changes. I think the new approach is rather cleaner.
To get a working arch xen system you'll need the following set of
patches:
 1. add ptep_establish_new to make va available
 2. return code for arch_free_page
 3. runtime disable of VT console
 4. HAS_ARCH_DEV_MEM enables Xen to use own /dev/mem definition
 5. split free_irq into teardown_irq
 6. alloc_skb_from_cache (already accepted by Dave Miller)
 7. bug fix: handle frag'ed skbs in icmp_filter (already accepted by Dave Miller)
The actual new architecture, arch xen, is too big to post to the list,
so here's a link:

Likewise for the virtual block, network, and console drivers:

Arch xen will be maintained by myself, Keir Fraser, Christian Limpach
and Steve Hand. 
Cheers,
Ian
