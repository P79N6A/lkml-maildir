The assumption is that the bus driver will take care of cleaning up all 
the children before unregistering the parent. This place a bit more 
responsibility on the bus driver, but it keeps it simple in the core. 
That's not to say that it can't change in the future, but I don't want to 
take that step right now. There are a lot of implications WRT locking and 
recursion that need to be worked out, and I'd rather wait on making these 
kind of core changes.
