Oh, yes s/bride/bridge/ ... Nice one Andreas. Women age so much better
than computers, but are just as much harder to change also.  ;)

I forgot to mention that on each occourance, if I turn the power off, wait a
few seconds, and turn it back on, all network cards work normally including
tulip.  It just looks like the chip isn't setup correctly[2] if it wasn't
already in a known state.
[2] I only say this because a power-down "fixes" the problem whereas a
sysctl-s-u-b soft-reset does not.  It could be the bios on this old machine
too.
As requested by Jeff Garzik, I'm going to copy the latest tulip driver from
2.4.19-pre6 to 2.4.17 and test it there.  Lennert, I'll test the three
bridgeing patches on top of that and let you know which one(s) cause the
problem with bridge removal.
