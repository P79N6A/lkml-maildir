I'd almost rather see this doc stick to the device topology interface in
hopes of describing something that RAID and MD can use too.  But just to
toss some information into the pool:
* When moving data around (raid rebuild, restripe, pvmove etc), we want
to make sure the data read off the disk is correct before writing it to
the new location (checksum verification).
* When moving data around, we don't want to move data that isn't
actually used by the filesystem.  This could be solved via new APIs, but
keeping it crash safe would be very tricky.
* When checksum verification fails on read, the FS should be able to ask
the raid implementation for another copy.  This could be solved via new
APIs.
* Different parts of the filesystem might want different underlying raid
parameters.  The easiest example is metadata vs data, where a 4k
stripesize for data might be a bad idea and a 64k stripesize for
metadata would result in many more rwm cycles.
* Sharing the filesystem transaction layer.  LVM and MD have to pretend
they are a single consistent array of bytes all the time, for each and
every write they return as complete to the FS.
By pushing the multiple device support up into the filesystem, I can
share the filesystem's transaction layer.  Work can be done in larger
atomic units, and the filesystem will stay consistent because it is all
coordinated.
There are other bits and pieces like high speed front end caching
devices that would be difficult in MD/LVM, but since I don't have that
coded yet I suppose they don't really count...
