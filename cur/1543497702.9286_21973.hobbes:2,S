I experience this exact problem, but in a slightly different manner...
Actually it's sometimes much worse.. From my box at home, any time I send
bursts of data through PPP to a site connected elsewhere on the internet, TCP
queues the data up for that one connection. Before that data is fully sent,
viewing /proc/net/tcp shows that it retransmits all those packets. After the
first retransmit, there is so much data going through that nothing ever
returns to its original state and TCP continues to retransmit data, therefore
locking up the entire ppp0 port. After about two retransmits, for some reason
the kernel seems to lock up from ever sending anything through the modem
again, while I know the modem is fully functioning. Thus a ping doesn't even
get across. I've had this problem since I started using 2.2 kernels (2.2.5+)
and under same hardware configuration had never experienced this the last time
I used PPP on 2.1.50+. 2.3.5 currently has the same problem. This is very
annoying because I can never send more than 64k of data through the network
from my computer without it locking up, sometimes intermittently between 64k
and 400k.
