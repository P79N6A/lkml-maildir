Ahhah!
This is another change in 2.3.x behaviour: it is a POSIX requirement that
I don't particularly like, but there you have it. Any access past the last
page of a file should give a SIGBUS. Previous Linux behaviour was to just
map in a zero page.

I will leave the SIGBUS behaviour, andif this is the only program that
breaks due to new POSIX conformance, I will consider us very lucky indeed.
Finges crossed. If some other major package breaks we will probably have
to forget that particular conformance detail..
