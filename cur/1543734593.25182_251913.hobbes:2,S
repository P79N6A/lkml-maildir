This causes problems when DRI and fb are loaded and you unload dri.. guess
what happens your fb??, or it does in theory I might have time to practice
later,
now the quick fix is to take the stealth/non-stealth code from CVS which
we know works or we wait for Alan to finish his vga device code and we fix
up the DRM and fb to use it ... this patch won't help anyways...
