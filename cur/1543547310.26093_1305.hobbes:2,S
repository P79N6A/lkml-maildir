I have discovered a problem with the Linux 2.4.0 VFAT filesystem. Short
names that have mixed case do not retain their case on the VFAT 
filesystem. This has mostly worked in the past on 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x
kernels. I am currently testing 2.4.0-test8-pre1. The filsystem was 
mounted with the following options: 'uid=500,gid=250,umask=000,quiet'. 
I have code page 437 and ISO 8859-1 built into the kernel with all 
other character sets available as modules. I have attached a BASH script 
that when run on a VFAT mounted filesystem fails. The last test case 
that the script runs fails on ALL versions of Linux that I have tested:
2.1.126, 2.2.16, 2.3.99-pre6 thru 2.4.0-test8-pre1.
