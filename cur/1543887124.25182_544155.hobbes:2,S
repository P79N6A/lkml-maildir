Where have the changes to Kconfig and Makefile gone? Without them, this
patch is a no-op.
BTW, the config option shouldn't be named SENSORS_DS1682 as your
original patch had - this device isn't a sensor. It should be just
"DS1682".

Technically, this is the ds1337 driver on which James and Russell have
a copyright, not yours. I don't think there is anything left from the
code you originally copied from, BTW.

Rather -EINVAL, this isn't an I/O error.

Shouldn't this be (u8 *)&val_le?

Bug! The last two arguments are swapped.
Also, I don't see the point of exporting this value to user-space, as
the format is proprietary.

I'm not sure if all compilers support this.

Should be ">=", otherwise you might end up doing a 0-length I2C block
read, which is bad.

This comment is no longer true.

Why check this? You should trust the person who wrote the device
definition in the platform code. The only reason why the older i2c chip
drivers did address checks is because that was one preliminary
device identification step. With the new model, you don't need to
identify the device, you already know what's there as per
architecture-level device declaration.
Not checking the address even has a benefit: if a compatible device
exists (today or in the future) with a different address, we don't need
to patch the driver to support it.

This no longer reflects what the driver is using.
