Not really. It is important that sensors-detect knows about chips which
are not supported by the running kernel. That way, we can tell the
users to try the latest version of sensors-detect when they report that
hardware monitoring doesn't work out of the box, and from the output,
we can tell them which kernel they need to upgrade to. If
sensors-detect reads the list of supported devices from the kernel,
instead of having its own, it will no longer work, by definition.
Additionally, sensors-detect is still supposed to support 2.4 kernels,
and I don't think 2.4 drivers advertise the list of devices they
support.
What we could do, on the other hand, is check the detected device ID
against the list the running kernel driver supports, to let the user
know that his/her chip is not supported by his/her kernel. Care to
provide a patch adding this functionality to sensors-detect?
Thanks,
