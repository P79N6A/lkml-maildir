Unfortunately, GDB needs to be able to recognize signal trampolines in
order to be able to single step correctly when a signal arrives.  At
least on some platforms.  Could be that the code-path in question
isn't used for Linux/i386, but I vaguely remember it does.
Anyway, signal trampolines could be marked with a special augmentation
in their CIE.
