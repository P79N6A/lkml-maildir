It should be easy enough to enable it for AMD as well, and it would also be 
good to track down the one failure you found...  I don't *think* the 
re-ordering of MTRR initialization should affect AMDs anymore than it does 
Intel, but someone familiar with the boot code would have to do a quick audit 
to be sure.
