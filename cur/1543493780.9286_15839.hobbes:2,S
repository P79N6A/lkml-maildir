Then you have enough cycles left, so it doesn't matter. The server always
has to be a bit oversized to handle traffic peaks, in non-peak situation
you can afford to be a bit less efficient (to complicate code to optimize
this would be wasted time).
Also if the threads pool size is adapting quickly enough it shouldn't
be that bad.

There is no such guarantee (except perhaps if you play with nice values[1]), 
but it does not matter when you keep statistics about number of requests/time.
As soon as the average time a thread has to wait in the accept goes below
some time add more threads. If it goes gets above the time kill threads and
lower the time. Costs you a few gettimeofdays() if you don't use a time
keeper thread (a thread that updates a timestamp counter in shared memory)

Only real tests can show. Anyways, if the kernel accept() behaviour
should really cause problems (I would guess it doesn't by intuition, but I 
have no data), then accept() should be fixed, not complicated code added
to th e user application.

[1] I wouldn't suggest that because of the possible nasty interactions
with other server processes running on the same machine.
