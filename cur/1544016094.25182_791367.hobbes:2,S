I think the two changes aren't exclusive at all.  The order of things
could be different but in the end, yeah, zero-based percpu symbols w/
mostly empty pda is the goal.

Any chance you can rebase those patches on top of mine?  If you don't
have time, just send them to me, I'll try to integrate them this week.

BTW, what did you do about the dreaded stack_canary?
Thanks.
