Well but this simply still doesn't make SMP magically scale
better. HT gives you about 12% increase in throughput on average.
This will hardly increase your MP3 ripping expierence :-).

And suddenly the Chip-Set manufacturers start to buy CPU
designs like creazy, becouse they can see what will be next... of course.

Again HT is still only one CPU. You are too software centric :-).

Yes HT gives 12%. naive SMP gives 50% and good SMP (aka corssbar bus)
gives 70% for two CPU. All those numbers are well below the level
where more then 2-4 makes hardly any sense... Amdahl bites you still if you
read it like:
88% waste (well actuall this time not)
50% waste
20% waste
on scale.
However corssbar switches are indeed allowing for maximally
64 CPUs and more importantly it's the first step since a long time
to provide better overall system throughput. However they will still
not be near any commodity - too much heat for the foreseeable future.

Yes but you can drive the technology only up to the perceptual limits
of a human. For example since about 6 years all those advancements
in the graphics area are largely uninterresting to me. I don't
play computer games. Never - they are too boring. Jet another
fan in my computer - no thank's.

Well the last real technological jump comparable to the invention
of television was actually due to this kind of CPUs which you
compare to microbes - mobiles :-). And well I'm awaiting the
day where there will be some WinWLAN card as shoddy as those Win
modems are... Fortunately they made 802.11b complicated enough :-)
But with a corssbar switch in place they could well make up for
the latency on the main CPU... oh fear... oh scare...
