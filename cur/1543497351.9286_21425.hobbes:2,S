On RedHat systems you could read /var/run/random-seed, the saved state from
/dev/random on last reboot (with a sanity check that its mtime is <= /proc/uptime). 
It should be pretty unlikely that there are collisions because it is 512 bytes of
random data. I don't know if other distributions have a similar mechanism.
I would suggest against relying on wtmp, because wtmp is notouriously unreliable
on Linux when multiple libc versions are in use.
