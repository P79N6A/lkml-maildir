I'm sorry that I have no data and idea. 
ZONE_MOVABLE is too young to be used under business workload...
just I feel...
Considering i686 which divides memory into NORMAL and HIGHMEM, it seems
that 4G to 8G servers looks stable under various workload in my experience.
Then, at least, 12.5% to 25% of "Total Memory - Hugepages" memory should be
under ZONE_NORMAL. But this is from experience of 32bit/SMP :(
Thanks,
