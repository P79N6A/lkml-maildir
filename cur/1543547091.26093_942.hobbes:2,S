What does it means?
 It means that raid5 received an IO request for a block of data for
 which is already had an outstanding IO request.  In these cases the
 two i/o requests had different buffer_head strutures.
 raid5 reports a bug, but actually handles the situation fairly
 gracefully: it blocks the second request until the first has
 finished. 
Can this cause data corruption?
 Not directly, but it might be a symptom of something else that could
 cause corruption.
Can i fix this problem?
 Maybe, but first we need to understand it.
 The question is, how could there be two different buffer_heads for
 the same block on disk?
 My understanding of the 2.2 buffer cache is not very good, but I
 think that all filesystems and block device IO go through the buffer
 cache, so any of these accesses should never allow two buffer_heads
 to point to the same block.
 However I believe that swapping doesn't go through the buffer cache.
 So: what are you doing with the raid5 partition.
   What sort of file system?
   Are you swapping to a file on the filesystems?
   Is there any chance that a parity reconstruction is happening when
   you get these messages.
   Is there anything at all about your usage of the raid5 device that
   could possibly be at all out of the ordinary?

Well, Ingo Molnar <mingo@redhat.com> is the official maintainer, and I
have been doing a fair bit of development lately.

quite stable, but not very fast.  RAID5 in 2.4.0 in particular is much
slower than 2.2.xx with mingo's patches.  I'm working on this from
time to time.
