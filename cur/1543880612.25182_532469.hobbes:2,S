I am not sure if I agree with this point of view. Driver (or
subsystem) provides an instance of struct device for the rest of the
system to iteract uniformly with (suspend/resume/tree
visualization/etc) i.e. struct device implement an interface for
subsystems. However most of the system use their own mechanisms to
manage their devices. They can rely on the driver core to a certain
degree but driver core is mostly a carries out helper functions, not
the meat.

Ah, right, I confused ->remove() with ->release() in your post. Sorry
about that.
