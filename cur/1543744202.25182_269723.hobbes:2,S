They restrict you from getting new updates, they don't restrict you from 
distributing.
The GPL says, "You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein."   Note the "granted herein" part.  They 
can put all kinds of other restrictions on anything else, as long as they don't 
keep you from excercising your rights to modify and/or redistribute the code 
released under the GPL.

I believe you have misunderstood the GPL.  They only disallow further 
restrictions on the rights that the GPL grants.  They don't say anything about 
other contracts or obligations.
