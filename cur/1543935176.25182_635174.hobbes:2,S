Subject: [PATCH 10/16] make emulate_insn receive a vcpu struct.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/7/130

emulate_insn() needs to know about current eip, which will be,
in the future, a per-vcpu thing. So in this patch, the function
prototype is modified to receive a vcpu struct
