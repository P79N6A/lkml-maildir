OK, I found this in raid6x86.h:
/* On i386, the stack is only 8-byte aligned, but SSE requires 16-byte
   alignment.  The +3 is so we have the slack space to manually align
   a properly-sized area correctly.  */
So I guess __attribute__((aligned(8))) is OK on i386, but 16-byte
alignment needs to be handled manually.
By the way, I haven't seen my mails on this thread make it to lkml
(despite having linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org in my Cc: line).
Obviously they're going out, since you replied to one, but they seem
to be getting eaten somewhere.
Thanks,
  Roland
