I had some problem like this. I don't know what caused it
because it was 'fixed' by a re-boot. I think it was that
the kernel 'thought' the block-size was wrong for the CD.
Anyway, the next time it happend, I copied the entire
contents of a CD to a file (ising 'cp'). I then mounted
the file through the loop device. I figured it might be
quicker than re-booting (it wasn't). It worked anyway.
The next time it happens, I will try to mount the CD
through the loop device. Anyway, you can try that now.
Maybe it will help you read it.
mount -t iso9660 -o loop /dev/cdrom /mnt
Cheers,
