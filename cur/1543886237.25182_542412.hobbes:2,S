A bunch of xfs changes appeared in git this morning, I thought.  But all
this first happened from a kernel compiled yesterday.

I saw similar damage in another repo, but I was using the "mq" extension
on that, which means the files are no longer append-only. 
I explicitly checked that repo was OK after I downloaded it.  It became
broken again after a while. 
It was as if the dirty inode data was dropped without being written to
disk, so once it had to read back it got a stale file length.  Or
something like that - I'm just guessing.
