Well, you're all wrong, bthththt...
Removing the .._GPL() is in this case correct, but not for any of the 
reasons mentioned, but simply because even Ingo agreed that it shouldn't 
be _GPL since it's explicitly meant for drivers that shouldn't have any 
knowledge whatsoever about the VM internals. GPL or not.
The fact that the code was back-ported from 2.5.x and that the _GPL still 
is there too is just a mistake, partly because I've not gotten any updates 
from Ingo..
