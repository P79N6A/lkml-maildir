Not really.  Users shouldn't be overriding EXTRA_CFLAGS, it's for the
benefit of various parts of the kernel.  Some other parts of the kernel
you break by doing this:
./arch/i386/mach-generic/Makefile:EXTRA_CFLAGS  += -I../kernel
./drivers/ide/pci/Makefile:EXTRA_CFLAGS := -Idrivers/ide
./drivers/message/fusion/Makefile:EXTRA_CFLAGS += ${MPT_CFLAGS}
./drivers/usb/storage/Makefile:EXTRA_CFLAGS     := -Idrivers/scsi
./fs/smbfs/Makefile:EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DSMBFS_PARANOIA
./fs/xfs/Makefile:EXTRA_CFLAGS +=        -Ifs/xfs -funsigned-char
./sound/oss/emu10k1/Makefile:    EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DEMU10K1_DEBUG
The normal way to do what you want is to edit the Makefile and add -g
directly to CFLAGS.
