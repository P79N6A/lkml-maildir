Changing the scheduler is not easy ( not to code patches but to make
everyone agree on the need of changing it ) and as i already said, it's

I can't say about NT.
I've tried a "cvs checkout" from cvs.microsoft.com but the running server
( Nimda-CVS running on port 2401 ) said me that, although I've full
