It did not work for me, either, but I verified that it works as
expected if I comment out actuall call of BIOS. So the problem is not
with Ole's patch but with bios, and it may be the same if you emulate
it...
[Of course, it will not crash whole system when emulated, but system
without video is not too good, either].
