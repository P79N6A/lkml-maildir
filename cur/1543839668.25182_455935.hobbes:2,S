Hmm.. Is this really true ? IIRC, schedule_work() checks pending
work based on bit ops on work->pending and clear_bit() is not
a memory barrier. So, if I see work->pending = 1 in free_fdtable_work(), how
do I know that the work function is already executing and
missed the new work that I had queued ?
Thanks
