Sorry, we are a bit confused of the formulation "adding the algorithmus to the 
new flow cache"
Why to the flow cache? What exaclty is the job of this flow cache?
Does the job go beyond caching recently "lookup results"?
What happens if the flow cache doesn't have a certain lookup result in the 
cache yet?
We mean, how is the packet classification solved then?
Is it right, that the code will then use a linear search algorithm and compare 
the packet with each rule sequentially until a rule is found that matches all 
relevant fields?
Our algorithm does not implement some kind of cache. Our algorithm is actually 
a replacement for that linear search algorithm. Our algorithm implements an 
advanced approach to the packet classification problem itself.
