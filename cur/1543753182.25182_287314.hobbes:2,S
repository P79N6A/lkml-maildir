Most of the latest (ie: 2004) serious kernel holes (if not all) have been
found by the isec.pl guys (
http://www.isec.pl/vulnerabilities.html
), specially
Paul Starzetz. While they're not a "auditing project", the effect they're
having is the same.
(By the way, secunia reports that 48% of the vulnerabilities reported for
the linux kernel are not patched 
http://secunia.com/product/2719/
 . I guess
they can't notice when bugs are fixed but I hope there's not any open hole
left)
