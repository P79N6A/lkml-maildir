One thing I would HATE to see is Linux shooting itself in the foot by
having a kassert somewhere that causes some system to become unusable.
That's the main reason I'm against the idea of kassert auto-oops'ing.

I'd be far more inclined to define two separate functions, kassert()
which prints the message and then continues as if it's not there, and
kassertoops() which prints the message and oops. That way, the choice
of function would document which was desired, and the developer could
use whichever was appropriate.
There is also the fact that by its nature, assertion checking makes
most of the standard oops report redundant as, if kassertoops was to
be used, the exact circumstances would be known in advance. It would
therefore make more sense to have two separate oops functions, one to
deal with the current oops events, and a second to deal with an oops
caused by a kassertoops() call.

I have to admit that such is NOT a use to which I have ever put
assert() and to my way of thinking, it's the wrong way of dealing with
it.

To be accurate, the failure of an assertion indicates that the person
who developed that particular piece of code made an assumption that
turned out not to be valid, and the purpose of the resultant message
is to point out that fact. It is in this context that any assertion
reports are most valuable, and this context is ONLY relevant when the
user is willing to do something with the said information.
Many years of experience has taught me that what I call the "Microsoft
Rule of Thumb" applies to most users - if an error message appears on
the screen, reformat the hard drive and reinstall everything. One
thing Linux is far better than M$ at is recovering from seemingly
impossible errors, and Linux is getting a reputation for that as well.
Misimplement something like kassert() and that reputation will vanish,
and for all the wrong reasons as well.

Since when !!!

Important, yes - but ONLY to people interested in kernel development,
and even then only to document assumptions the developer has made. If
they're used as an error detecting system, as you appear to be
proposing, then they're being seriously misused.

Like I said, in an APPLICATION context, '#ifndef NDEBUG' is normally
correct, but I do not believe it is also correct in a KERNEL context.

I've just checked, and you are of course correct: My version doesn't
print out the condition correctly with gcc. I'm far too used to
Borland's TurboC for which my version worked - I just copied it from a
program I wrote and had to hand, where the standard assert() behaviour
of calling abort() was inappropriate.
Here's the corrected version:
