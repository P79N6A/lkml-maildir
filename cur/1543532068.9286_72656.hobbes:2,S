Whatever, I'll put a network up when I want one, and I'll put an IP
address up when I want one. I most definitely DON'T want the machine to
put a network up for me when I don't say so. The current behaviour is
broken in several respects:
1) ifconfig lo:7 down downs lo
2) ifconfig lo up ups lo:7
3) routes and arp are changed when I put an alias up on lo:7 when I don't
   want this to be anything else but a dummy, visible only locally
The folowing situation shows a machine that responded ITSELF to pings
and telnet to its LOCAL alias, both from the machine itself and from
OUTSIDE (except from the real second host, of course ..).

This is a bug. Kernel 2.2.10 in this instance, but I've seen it
elsewhere. Unfortunately I didn't get the arp tables before I lost
contact. But the whole net was being taken to this machine instead
of the 200 addresses real owner.
