That should work. However, I do have once concern. At the generic
list macro level, we don't know if the lockfree traversal is being
done in forward or backward direction. So, I am not sure if
list_del_rcu() should poison the backward pointer or atleast
document the fact that RCU-based traversal would not work on
backward pointers. hlist_del_rcu() can indeed poison pprev.

Since we are at it, I can submit a patch documenting the rest of
hlist functions, if you like.
