After few months of problems with eepro with the following hardware
Intel STL2 (Serverworks III LE) Mainboard
and
Asus CUVX-D (via 694D chipset)
I trashed the cards and now using 3C905
There're several problems with the stability of drivers in eepro drivers
May be the problem is lack of low level decumentation for the cards
They advise to use their binnary only driver (did you? :)).
