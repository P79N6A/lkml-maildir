Hello,
I am not on this list by post by told so in REPORTING-BUGS.
By installing kde-1.1.2 with gcc-2.95.1 I noticed a wrong declaration in
/usr/incluce/linux/socket.h:109
  ANSI C++ forbids implicit conversion from `void *' in return
The right ANSI way to do it is to return a literal "0".
By taking a quick glance on the other headerfiles there are many places that
uses NULL without explicit conversion.
Maybe (adhearing to ANSI???) NULL has to be defined "0" and not (void*) ...
Yours
Uwe Koloska
