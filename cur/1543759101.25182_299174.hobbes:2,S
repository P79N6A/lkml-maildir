Debian unstable currently contains only for kernel 2.6.8 (which is AFAIK 
still the main kernel in Debian unstable although there are also 2.6.10 
sources and 2.6.10 kernel images on some architectures) for eight 
different architectures - many of them containing or depending on their 
own patches.
How big is the value of a
  New 2.6.8-5 s390 kernel images for Debian unstable - please test!
or a
  New 2.2.25-4 atari kernel images for Debian unstable - please test!
on LKML?
Note that there are currently 42 (what a number ;-) ) different packages 
that build 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 kernels images in Debian unstable plus the 
packages that build the kernel images for the 11 architectures in Debian 
stable.
Considering how many other distributions exist, this generates a serious 
amount of extra traffic on LKML if a security hole gets fixed that 
affects many kernel versions...
