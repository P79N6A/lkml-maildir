yeah - it changed spin_lock()'s assembly to do a "LOCK BTRL", which is a 
trylock which tries to dirty the cacheline. There was a "REP NOP" after 
it and a loop back to the "LOCK BTRL".

ok, it's not completely clear where exactly the other core was spinning, 
but i took it from Miklos' observations that the other core was hanging 
in the _very same_ task_rq_lock() - which is a true spinlock as well 
that acquires it. So on one core the spin_lock() was starving, on 
another one it was always succeeding.

so the problem was not the trylock based spin_lock() itself (no matter 
how it's structured in the assembly), the problem was actually modifying 
the lock and re-modifying it again and again in a very tight 
high-frequency loop, and hence not giving it to the other core?

yeah - i'm not at all arguing in favor of the BTRL patch i did: i always 
liked the 'nicer' inner loop of spinlocks, which could btw also easily 
use MONITOR/MWAIT. (my patch is also quite close to what we did in 
spinlocks many years ago, so it's more of a step backwards than real 
progress.)
So it seems the problem was that if a core kept _truly_ modifying a 
cacheline via atomics in a high enough frequency, it could artificially 
starve the other core. (which would keep waiting for the cacheline to be 
released one day, and which kept the first core from ever making any 
progress) To me that looks like a real problem on the hardware side - 
shouldnt cacheline ownership be arbitrated a bit better than that?
Up to the point where some external event (perhaps a periodic SMM 
related to thermal management) broke the deadlock/livelock scenario?
