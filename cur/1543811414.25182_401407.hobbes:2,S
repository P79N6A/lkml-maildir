a.  why does SONY_ACPI default to m ?  Other similar options are default n.
b.  config LSF
	bool "Support for Large Single Files"
	depends on X86 || (MIPS && 32BIT) || PPC32 || ARCH_S390_31 || SUPERH || UML
	default n
	help
	  When CONFIG_LBD is disabled, say Y here if you want to
	  handle large file(bigger than 2TB), otherwise say N.
	  When CONFIG_LBD is enabled, Y is set automatically.
This config option appears to be unimplemented and the Help text is
incorrect:  it is not set to Y automatically when CONFIG_LBD is enabled.
Where did this come from?
