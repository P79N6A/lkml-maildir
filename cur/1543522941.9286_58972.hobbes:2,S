Hi all,
seems I am suffering from the same problem: In my case, nfs-based users 
start the whole trouble - home directory gets automounted and as soon as
you open Netscape, the trouble starts (looks like multiple accesses in a 
short time).
On my P2B-LS, I can't change slots, of course, but I fiddled with BIOS 
parameters, which did not help either: Moving the card from a shared IRQ to
its own did not have any effect.
Also, I am experiencing these problems since ~2.3.20, thats why I created
a set of local users on my machine to be able to work uninterrupted. 
My bus looks like:

The logs did not show anything interesting, except the ring dumps and nfs
complaining about lost server connections, of course. 
I suspected our switch first, which causes troubles sometimes, so I increased
the timeout value to 20sec once, which had no effect either...
So long,
Simon
