I've been more concerned with getting core changes we need to him than
updating arch/parisc and include/asm-parisc.  Maybe I should have been
more pushy.

What data do you need to make that decision?  AFAICT (I'm not really
a PA CPU guru..) it's exactly the same amount of code, no matter which
way we do it.
While we're on the subject of cache flushing... these make no sense:
fs/binfmt_aout.c:357:           flush_icache_range(text_addr, text_addr+ex.a_text+ex.a_data);
fs/binfmt_aout.c:381:                   flush_icache_range((unsigned long) N_TXTADDR(ex),
fs/binfmt_aout.c:479:           flush_icache_range((unsigned long) start_addr,
fs/binfmt_elf.c:422:    flush_icache_range((unsigned long)addr,
the kernel doesn't execute the code ranges here, userspace does.  Which
means that the only place in the entire kernel which does need to call
flush_icache_range() is kernel/module.c, and that could all be done in
module_arch_init().  So I think we don't need flush_icache_range() at all.
