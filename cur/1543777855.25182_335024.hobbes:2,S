That should be mentioned in kconfig-language.txt. OTOH, the build system
should automatically propagate the dependencies. I asume that should be
easy, except for having the time to implement that.
BTW: How can you select something to be at least a module?
BTW2: In bool options, depending on FOO seems to be equal to depending on 
      FOO!=n. Is this assumption correct?
