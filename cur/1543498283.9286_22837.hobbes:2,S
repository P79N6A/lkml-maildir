   Look at 
ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/linux/LFS/
   You might also try the Simple Multi-Gigabyte Filesystem (smugfs) at
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/mj/linux/smugfs-0.0.tar.gz,
 which
is a purely experimental (but AFAIK working) filesystem for very large
(well, _only_ for large files since it allocates space in 1/255's of
partition size :-)) files with very fast indexing (no indirect blocks
etc.). Unfortunately, I don't have any time to maintain it.
				Have a nice fortnight
