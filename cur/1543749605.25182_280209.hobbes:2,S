Here's a step-by-step explanation of the way I test this:
- Get the Memory Eater and compile it:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/13/272
- Do a clean boot
- Start top, and some app that has a clock and preferrably a CPU graph (to
monitor screen freezes and CPU load; it's IceWM for me)
- Start the Memory Eater
- Give it an amount of megabytes that is more than the actual RAM size. I
use a value of 300, as my computer has 256 M RAM.
- Enjoy :) "eatmemory" will slowly eat up more and more RAM (visible in
top as RSS); under 2.6.8.1 no screen freezes come, and under 2.6.9 and
2.6.10-rc3 they do come; under 2.6.10-rc3 I also see high CPU periods for
kswapd.
Yours, Mikhail Ramendik
