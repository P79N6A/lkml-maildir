Most debuggers/crash dumpers etc. need a way to veto normal processing of NMIs 
and other exceptions. For NMI the usual case is to turn off the nmi watchdog 
while you do something slow with interrupts disabled, that requires
doing the hook very early. Without veta NMI notification is not very useful.
You want something like:
	if (notifier_call_chain(&nmi_notifier_list, 0, regs) == NOTIFY_BAD)
		goto ignore;
For a more comprehensive variant see include/asm-x86_64/kdebug.h	
The x86-64 variant cannot be 1:1 copied because it's still incomplete
and e.g. does not implement veto for all places where it's needed.
