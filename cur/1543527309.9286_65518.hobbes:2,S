The performance issue here is /proc/<pid>. All the other entries
people keep on complaining about have only marginal relevance for
performance.

That varies a lot from file to file. E.g. I haven't seen any programs
that are specificly designed to read /proc/atm/* yet, and I know of
only one (fuser) that reads /proc/mounts, extracting only partial
information (just to pick two examples that I'm quite familiar with).
Also, what are all the integrated system administration tools (linuxconf,
etc.) written in ? I wouldn't be surprised if many of them are written
in some scripting language. So they'd have to access that information via
the dedicated utility written in C. Are you sure
  binary-interface -> utility -> parser-in-script-language
is really superior to
  /proc -> parser-in-script-language
? (Throw in internationalization to make things even messier.)

Are you suggesting that you would find it easier to handle inconsiderate
changes to binary structures ?
A better example would be /proc file fields that contain tabs, spaces,
or newlines. This is a real problem. A clean solution would be a
function that turns such names into valid C source strings, with blanks
escaped too e.g.  "this\tis\nhard\200to\040parse"
(there are several other reasonable alternatives).
