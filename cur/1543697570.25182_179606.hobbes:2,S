No, you're not alone... Although I don't have a Centrino-powered machine
at the moment, the way Intel is behaving is stopping for me for even
thinking on buying a new laptop replacement.
I think this kind of disinterest on Linux Centrino drivers is motivated
by the fact that Microsoft has a strong relationship with Intel and
since, like it or not, Windows has 90% of the desktop market, Intel
doesn't see the motivation to spend a few hundred dollars in building
the driver themselves.
However, they could at least release the documentation. Since the driver
is, I think, going to be GPL'ed, they don't have to fear releasing the
internals of Centrino.
