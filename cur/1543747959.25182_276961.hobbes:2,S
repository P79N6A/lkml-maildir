Look at the history of util-linux.
Of course it did the latter. Up to the point that broke.
Then invented a silly workaround. Up to the point that broke.
Then tried something else. Up to the point that broke.
Then gave up including this particular header and made a
private copy. Again, there is some painful history with
the private copy. I showed the current version.
You see - util-linux advertises: all kernels, all archs,
all libc versions since 4.6.27.
If the kernel improves today, it is too late for util-linux.
But yes, the include situation is painful.
It seems there is some recent progress. We'll see what happens.
