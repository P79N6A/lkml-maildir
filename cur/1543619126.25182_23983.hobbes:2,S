Hello everyone,
master.kernel.org is currently offline; it seems that some of the
preparation work for doing an OS upgrade later this week backfired and
triggered a problem (not necessarily a bug -- this was more in the
class of pilot error) with the RAID controller.  We are trying to
bring it back online, but it might take a while; if we can't we will
restore it from backups.
In the meantime ftp.kernel.org et al will operate normally, but will
not receive new updates.
