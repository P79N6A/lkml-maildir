Subject: [PATCH 3/4] posix timers: timer_delete: remove the bogus "->it_process != NULL" check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/3/150

sys_timer_delete() and itimer_delete() check "timer->it_process != NULL", this
looks completely bogus. ->it_process == NULL means that this timer is already
under destruction or it is not fully initialized, this must not happen.
	sys_timer_delete: the timer is locked, and lock_timer() can't succeed
	if ->it_process == NULL.
	itimer_delete: it is called by exit_itimers() when there are no other
	threads which can play with signal_struct->posix_timers.
