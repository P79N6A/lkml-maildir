Subject: [PATCH 0/2] re-send of flush_workqueue/flush_work patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/29/96

Changes:
[PATCH 1/2] reimplement flush_workqueue()
	Not changed, just re-diff against 2.6.20-rc2-mm1
[PATCH 2/2] implement flush_work()
	Fix a race vs cpu-hotplug. The work should be dequeued before
	we check any CPU for ->current_work == work, otherwise the work
	can migrate to already checked CPU.
Oleg.
