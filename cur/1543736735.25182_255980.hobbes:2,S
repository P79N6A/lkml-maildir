I finally found some time to experiment with your page scalability
patches. Unluckily it is not possible to implement a spinlock free
update of page table entries if we want to keep our ipte optimization.
The ipte instruction is behind our ptep_clear_flush and ptep_establish
primitives. The instruction invalidates a pte by setting the invalid
bit (0x400) and flushes the tlbs on all cpus referring to this pte.
The catch is that the instruction only works on the original,
unmodified pte and that the store of the byte containing the invalid
bit isn't atomic in regard to other changes to the pte. So we have
to take the page table lock for all changes to ptes because ipte
might race against other updates.
Since we don't have that many processors on s390 the selective
purging of the tlb by the ipte instruction is more important then
the spinlock free page table update. The only operation that could
use an atomic update on s390 is pgd_test_and_populate for 64 bit.
Since this is a rather infrequently used operation it doesn't make
too much sense to optimize it. That leaves ptep_xchg_flush as the
operation that needs to get implemented by use of the ipte. You'll
find a new patch that adds an implementation of ptep_xchg_flush for
s390 below, the old patch is broken. Please replace.
There are some more things that need improvement:
* You should introduce a #define for each of the new primitives
  (__HAVE_ARCH_PTEP_CMPXCHG, __HAVE_ARCH_PTEP_XCHG_FLUSH, etc) so
  that the architectures can redefine the primitives separatly.
  For s390 I need to define a ptep_xchg_flush but want to use the
  default implementation for all the other new primitives.
* In the generic implementations of the new primitives please use
  the mm from the vma to do the locking. To rely on the fact that
  the memory structure in the functions that use the macros are always
  called "mm" is quite a hack.
* The ptep_get_clear_flush primitive isn't used anywhere and should
  be removed.
* The flush_tlb_page in the generic ptep_cmpxchg implementation
  shouldn't be there, the macro is used in code sequences where it
  isn't needed (the old code didn't flush).
blue skies
  Martin.
