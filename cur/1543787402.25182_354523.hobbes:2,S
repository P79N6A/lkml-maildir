My suggestion on this is to rename the flag too, as ignore_nice_load (or 
ignore_nice_tasks, choose your way). Don't forget to do it in docs too.
So userspace tools will error out rather than do the reverse of what they were 
doing, and the user will fix the thing according to the (new) docs.
This is the way we avoid problems in kernel code, when changing APIs (I read 
Linus talking about this), so I assume it's ok?
