You could define a generic device driver interface.
Let's call it UDI. Now you implement a GPL version of
this for Linux, a 2-clause BSD version for FreeBSD,
and a proprietary version for Windows. You then write a
few drivers using this interface, under a half-dozen
different licenses.
One of those drivers is proprietary. It can run in the
Linux kernel. It sure isn't derived from Linux though.
There isn't any Linux code in it, and the driver works
in the Windows and FreeBSD kernels as well as in Linux.
There you go: use of GPL symbols from a non-GPL driver.
