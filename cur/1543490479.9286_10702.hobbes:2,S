Hmm... Alright.. I'll stop. :) When you say the BIOS failed to do it's
job, do you mean that it failed to set the drive into UDMA more? Or it's
just not providing the correct information to the kernel? I'm a little
confused about the role the BIOS plays in this situation, so I'll take a
gander over the source and see what I can dig up on it.

That is hilarious! :) Being a fan of beer bongs, this made me fall out of
my chair laughing, but I get the picture.

Hmm.. perhaps I can get someone over at Aladdin to pitch in, but chances
are they won't be much help. I guess I'm just stuck with a crappy MB for
the time being and lowly 8mb / second transfer rates.. (Aw shucks.. I can
only load 1 MP3 per second! ;)

I'll do that. If I can offer any assistance, I'll contribute where
possible. I do, however, want to let you know how much I appreciate the
work that you are putting into the IDE drivers on Linux. Sometimes many
users take for granted what they are running and don't consider the source
and time invested by all the Linux hackers out there. I'm sure it's a
thankless job most of the time, but keep up the good work anyway. If you
can get the UDMA code working on the ALI, I'll ship you out a case of your
favorite beer! ;)
