Good point, my package doesn't have that problem, but your suggestion
should nicely fit into Rusty's patch, but it seems like increasing in 
overhead now. 
Could you also comment on the functionality that has been discussed. 
(I) the fairness issues that have been raised.
    do you support two wakeup mechanism: FUTEX_UP and FUTEX_UP_FAIR 
    or you don't care about fairness and starvation
(II) the rwlocks issues,
     do you support rich set of functions/ops such as below
(a) writer preference
        if any writer is waiting then wake that one up.
(b) reader preference
        if any reader is waiting wait up all the readers in the queue
(c) fifo preference
        if the first waiter is a writer wait it up, otherwise wake up all 
readers
(d) fifo-fair  preference
        like (c), but only wake up readers until the next writer is 
encountered
(a) - (c) can be implemented with Rusty's 2 user-ueue approach as long
as the wakeup type is always the same. The last one can't (?).
In the kernel this is easy to implement, but the trouble is the status
word in user space, still thinking about it.
It also requires compare and swap.
Thanks for your time and pointing this out.
