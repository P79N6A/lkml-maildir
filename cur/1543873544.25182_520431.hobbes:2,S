Might be a reasonable solution - let's see what Peter comes up with too.
Comments on the patch:
- Please don't VM_DIRTY_LIMIT_RATIO: just use CTL_UNNUMBERED and leave
  sysctl.h alone.
- The 40% default is already too high.  Let's set this new upper limit to
  40% and decrease he non-blocking ratio.
- Please update the procfs documentation in ./Docmentation/
- I wonder if dirty_limit_ratio is the best name we could choose. 
  vm_dirty_blocking_ratio, perhaps?  Dunno.
