	I got your earlier message and was following up on a couple of
other angles.  I've also got patches from "Artem V. Ryabov" <artem@abak.ru>
to do this as well.  So it looks like we've got two efforts going on.  You
may want to contact him and compare notes.  I'm adding him in on this
message as well in case he's not actively reading linux-kernel.
	Volker no longer maintains either smbfs or smbmount.  I maintain
smbmount in Samba and Bill Hawes is suppose to be maintaining smbfs in the
kernel (at least the version in 2.2.x).  Unfortunately, I have not been able
to contact Bill in over six months.  Linus told me that he thought Bill was
only going to do some ongoing support maintenance, and not do any active
development maintenance.  At LinuxWorld Expo, I spoke with Peter Anvin and
he said he would talk to Bill and find out what the story is.  I haven't
heard back from him since.
	If anyone knows how to contact Bill, please rattle his cage!  We
need to at least know, yeah or nay, if he wants to be handling this!

	Let me look this over and reconcile it with the patch I got from
Russia.  You both should now have each other's address, so you can look
over each other's efforts.
