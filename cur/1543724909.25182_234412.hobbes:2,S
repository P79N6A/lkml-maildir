The physical address will do you no good because your process
uses the virtual address to access everything.
Do `cat /proc/PID/maps` where PID is a process ID number. You
will see the virtual address of the executable and runtime
shared libraries that the task is using. These are memory-mapped
into the tasks address-space.
If your code is ANYWHERE, including on a RAM-Disk, it will
be memory-mapped into your address-space just like what you
see. This allows everybody to share all the executables and
all the run-time libraries so they don't need separate copies.
For instance, here's somebody running the `bash` shell:
08048000-0808c000 r-xp 00000000 08:11 1440929    /usr/bin/bash
0808c000-08092000 rw-p 00043000 08:11 1440929    /usr/bin/bash
08092000-080a2000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
40000000-4000a000 r-xp 00000000 08:11 475506     /usr/lib/ld-2.0.5.so
4000a000-4000b000 rw-p 00009000 08:11 475506     /usr/lib/ld-2.0.5.so
4000b000-4000c000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
4000c000-40010000 r--p 00000000 08:11 163651     /etc/ld.so.cache
40010000-40012000 rwxp 00000000 08:11 1030227    /lib/libtermcap.so.2.0.8
40012000-40014000 rw-p 00001000 08:11 1030227    /lib/libtermcap.so.2.0.8
40014000-4009f000 r-xp 00000000 08:11 475508     /usr/lib/libc-2.0.6.so

You can see the virtual address of your own stuff by compiling
and executing this:
#include <stdio.h>
extern char _start;
extern char _end;
char dat;
const char x[]="x";
int main()
{
    char foo;
    printf("start = %p\n", &_start);
    printf(" main = %p\n", main);
    printf(" data = %p\n", &dat);
    printf("const = %p\n", x);
    printf("stack = %p\n", &foo);
    printf("  end = %p\n", &_end);
    return 0;
}
The physical address in RAM could be anywhere. The kernel takes
pages of RAM from anywhere and makes them look contiguous for
each task. So what looks like linear address-space is made up
of (on ix86 0x1000 byte) pages of RAM.
