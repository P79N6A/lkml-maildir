A few days after posting this, the box developed much stranger behaviour,
like randomly segfaulting applications. A run of memtest86 revealed that
one of the RAM sticks went bad. It was good when I put it in (I tested it
back then), but most likely the bad memory is the cause of reported
oops. Praised be mentest86.
Sorry for the noise.
