You misunderstand.
I object to your _idiotic_ claim that there are "systemic problems", where 
your "solution" to them is apparently to stop making releases and stop 
making forward progress. 
That's why I said you told us was nothing like that. What you told us were 
your personal problems, no "systemic" issues.
