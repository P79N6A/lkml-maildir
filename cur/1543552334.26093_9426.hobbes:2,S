Yes, you're right, read-ahead is in fact even more likely to catch the
race.

Yes. But I'd rather have a small race where we under certain strange
circumstances forget to raise a SIGBUS than have a kernel bug that causes
oops and possible filesystem corruption. 
So I'm not just looking for a fix, I'm also looking for a SIMPLE fix, with
perhaps some major surgery later (things like making the inode semaphore a
read-write semaphore and just always synchronizing 100% on i_size - which
would fix the problem, but is not a 2.4.x thing, no way Jose).

exit() basically does do a msync(MSASYNC), so that could be it.
