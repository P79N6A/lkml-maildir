Preference for evicting one kind of cache is indeed a bad
thing. It might work for 90% of the workloads, but you can
be sure it breaks horribly for the other 10%.
I'm currently busy tweaking the old 2.4 VM (in the -ac kernels)
to try and get optimal performance from that one, without giving
preference to one kind of cache ... except in the situation where
the amount of cache is excessive.

This is an interesting thing, too. Something to look into for
2.5 and if it turns out simple enough we may even want to
backport it to 2.4.
