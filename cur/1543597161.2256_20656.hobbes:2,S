Subject: strange 2.4.x problems with dual machine

Hello,
machine is a dual Celeron (mendocino) with 256 M RAM, pretty standard. Ran
fine with 2.2.x, now when I switched to 2.4.2, 2.4.5 or 2.4.6 it freezes
on random (under X). Worked in text mode for a while and then printed out
a line "APIC error on CPU #0: 00(08)" and died...
Any ideas? I have booted the kernels both with and without "noapic" and
still the same...
