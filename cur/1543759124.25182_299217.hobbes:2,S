I just recompiled and reconfigured with libata sata_sil.c instead
of ide siimage.c, and now everything just works fine.
I just noticed this in dmesg:
** PCI interrupts are no longer routed automatically.  If this
** causes a device to stop working, it is probably because the
** driver failed to call pci_enable_device().  As a temporary
** workaround, the "pci=routeirq" argument restores the old
** behavior.  If this argument makes the device work again,
** please email the output of "lspci" to bjorn.helgaas@hp.com
** so I can fix the driver.
.. so perhaps that might causing siimage.c to break, but this
being a production server now catching up with a backlog I can't
try it right away.
Mike.
