We have alot of production machines here, all running RH5.2 and 2.2.9
kernel.  For some reason, our primary and secondary nameservers keep
crashing all of the sudden.  The kernel has been on them since the day it
came out, but out of the blue they keep crashing multiple times per day
with the following Oops:
kmem_free: Bad obj addr (objp = c4110b80, name = size-128)
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0002
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[<c011e3c9>]
EFLAGS: 00010202
eax: 00000039   ebx: c0373140   ecx: c0202000   edx: ffffff9d
esi: c3549e00   edi: 00000202   ebp: 00000001   esp: c0203e1c
ds: 0018   es: 0018   ss: 0018
Process swapper (pid: 0, process nr: 0, stackpage=c0203000)
From my System.map, the EIP line points to:
c011e244 T kfree
It was posted here that it could be a DoS attack using the latest exploit.
I patched using the patch to prevent that exploit.  I tried the exploit on
the patched box, and of course the exploit did not work.  The crashes
continued however.  I then patched both machines to ac5, and the crashes
still continue.
Machines are:
RH5.2
Running BIND
MD RAID1
Other than that, their is nothing special about these boxes.  All the
RH5.2 updates have been installed.  What can I do to further narrow down
the source of the problem?
