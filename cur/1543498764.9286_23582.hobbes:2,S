The smbpassword hashes are used for encryption.  The SMB password hash
is the secret shared between the client and the server - the Unix
password hash is NOT.  Symmetric cryptography needs shared secrets -
whether to send them in cleartext over the network or store them on disk
is a matter of choice.

They can be convinced to do so, by editing the registry.  (But you already
knew that.  Surely you must have read the documentation for Samba)
Anyway, most (if not all) of this is way off-topic, so this will be my
last posting on this matter.
