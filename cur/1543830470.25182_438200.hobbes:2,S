It might be nice, but it is probably unneeded for an initial
implementation.  In practice, a cluster doing
checkpoint/restart/migration will already have a system in place for
assigning unique IPs or other identifiers to each container.  It could
just as easily make sure to assign unique network device names to
containers.
The issues really only come into play when you have an unstructured set
of machines and you want to migrate between them without having prepared
them with any kind of unique net device names beforehand.
It may look weird, but do application really *need* to see eth0 rather
than eth858354?
