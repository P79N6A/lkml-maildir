Yes . The sysfs code gets moved in the next patch so it resides in the
timekeeping code ..

A long time ago I changed "current_clocksource" to
"timekeeping_clocksource" which made sense at the time .. I got push

This was on purpose , because I feel the sysfs organization benefits
when you have the clocksource users all in one place. Along with the
list of available clocksources .. I'm all ears if you have a better
suggestion ..
