You're basically implementing another VFS layer inside of reiser4, which 
is a big layering violation.
This sort of feature should -not- be done at the low-level filesystem level.
What happens if people decide plugins are a good idea, and they want 
them in ext3?  We need massive surgery to extract the guts from reiser4.
