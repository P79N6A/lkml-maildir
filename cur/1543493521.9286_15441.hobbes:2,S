Capabilities is about permissions do do things: A capability is a key to
some resource that can _only_ be used by processes that own that
capability.
If what you understand under capability is something different, then yes,
we are talking different kettle of fish.

Capabilities (see above) are exactly the kind of "I am allowed to..." that
you exclude here. So we were agreeing all along?!

Perhaps you don't, but for me (with some 15+ years Unix admin) it _still_
is automatic (or almost).
