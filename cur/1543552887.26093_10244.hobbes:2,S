This change sounds ok to me, if noone else objects.  (I added to the CC
a bit)  I saw that code, and was thinking about doing the same thing
myself.  ne2k-pci.c definitely has changes which are not included in
ne.c, and it seems silly to duplicate ne2000 PCI support.

P.S.  Pavel, for the future, patches made with "diff -u" are preferred.
