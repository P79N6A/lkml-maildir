The protocol itself doesn't encode it, but before we extend it for 
protocol >= 0x0202 we need to make sure that older kernels don't break 
if they get a very long command line (truncation is OK, crashing is 
not.)  If they do crash, we need to add a field in the header.
I don't see any reason why the boot parameter block can't be more than 
one page long.  I think today that it's just a static structure.
