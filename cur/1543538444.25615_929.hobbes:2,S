It was not intended to give better performance...
(something masks the expected latency improvements - floppy is
disturbing
 me, recal_interrupt. And kmem stuff - but that is more understandable
 we will issue additional 'kmem_cache_reap']
I examined the patches again and the fact that it runs
do_try_to_free_pages
periodically may improve performance due to its page cleaning effect -
all pages won't be dirty at the same time...
But it has a downside too - it will destroy the LRU order of pages...
PG_referenced loses some of its meaning...
Streaming writes are likely to gain the most.
Non uniform random accesses may loose :-(
I have an idea...
