   Hello all! This may be off-topic, but does anyone has experience 
with 4 port ethernet cards in Linux? How good are their drivers, are 
they open-source and do they provide channel bonding with any 
kind of switching equipment? I´ve seen Phobos sell some with 
Linux support, but now they seem to just license the technology to 
OEM´s.
Regards,
Pedro Rodrigues
