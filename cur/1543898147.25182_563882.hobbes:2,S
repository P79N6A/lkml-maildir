No.  The vfsmount will go away completely medium-term once we get right
of the atomic open nfs hack that paases a file back in the open intent.
A normal filesystem has not business looking at the vfsmount instance at
all, and the raw open/create we need to replace the atomic open hack
will need the full nameidata per definition, also to allow things like
a multi-component lookup that various cluster/network filesystems really
want.
