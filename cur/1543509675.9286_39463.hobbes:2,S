Am I right in thinking that one might be able to use such a modem as, what
the BBC calls, a "Telephone Control and Balance Unit"? Maybe in the U.S. it's
called a "Hybrid".
That is, one might be able to hold a telephone conversation through the Linux
machine's standard soundcard and the modem, and record the output, just as
one does in a broadcast studio?
I can think of several Linux news sites (and my own setup) that would jump at
the chance of a cheap way of recording telephone interviews in reasonable
quality.
