Actually, no, because of the way we run the queues for the next command.
If this is a sd_sync_cache() or something for the last possible command
on the device, the process may have a reference to the device, but as
soon as we call end_that_request_last(), they may be racing to release
it.  The bug is triggered when we get into scsi_next_command() with us
holding the only remaining reference to the device.
