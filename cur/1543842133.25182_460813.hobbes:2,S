It seems to me that the issues of the capability inheritance semantics
and the capability filesystem support are quite orthogonal.  My patch
provides the first, and will quite happily live with a patch such as

Even in the absence of filesystem support, there is no reason for
capabilities not to be inheritable: this is what my patch addresses.
Of course, it is even more interesting in the presence of filesystem
support.  (I could provide a combined patch that would do both, with
xattrs, as a proof of concept.)

Yes, it required a slight rethinking, and that is precisely what I am

Do you see anything specificly wrong with it?

At least the crippling of CAP_SETPCAP was deliberate and unnecessary:
it was done following an incorrect analysis by the sendmail team of a
caps-related sendmail exploit under Linux.

Resolving them is precisely what I proposed to do.  If you are saying
someone else also proposed to do the same, can you point to that work?
Perhaps we could merge usefully and thus go forward faster.

I don't quite understand what you're saying here.  Do you see
something wrong with my proposal for doing it?
