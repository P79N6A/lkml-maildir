Well, I ask because there is probably quite a large number of embedded type
devices devices that you could "just add a small patch for" to get it working.
The added fact that you have to "hack" the hardware (I think?) to even get
it to run Linux makes it probably a bit more questionable (it is great that
we can run on xbox, but maybe not too harmful to keep it as an external patch).
Anyway I've otherwise got no objections ;) if you can convince Andrew and/or
Linus to merge it, then fine.
