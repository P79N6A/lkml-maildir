Access to the array is correct, even with non-zero values the code that is
reading/writing to the array knows the exact size of the descriptor. Within
rt2x00 are however 5 drivers who have different descriptor sizes. That means
I can't create a structure which has the correct array length.
The structure itself is just a simple map over preallocated memory
(skb->data in case of USB or dma in case of PCI).
So possible solutions would be:
 - remove struct data_desc and make it a void* or __le32*
   This is at the cost of code readibility since the above pointers
   have less meaning then a pointer to a structure which can be nicely
   documented.
 - increase the word[] array to something that fits all (+/- 20 entries)
   This wouldn't really be a problem, all it requires is fixing the sizeof() 
   statements. But then the code should contain a big note about that it
   is not allowed to read/write _all_ words in the entry since it depends on
   the driver that uses it.
What would in this case be the best solution for good coding style?
