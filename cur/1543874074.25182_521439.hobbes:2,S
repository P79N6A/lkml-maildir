In busybox project we adopted the usage of -Wundef
and we try to minimize usage of #ifdef CONFIG_xxx - each boolean
CONFIG_xxx option for busybox is accompanied with
ENABLE_xxx #define which is 1 or 0, never "undefined",
and we check it instead of CONFIG_xxx.
Because if -Wundef, gcc complains whenever we use #if
on undefined ENABLE_xxx.
