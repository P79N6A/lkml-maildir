Then you are suggesting to add __GFP_NORETRY, to all my allocations.
That's may well be a valid argument, if we want to treat userspace
filesystems less critical, than other things.
Adding _NOFS in the case where no deadlock is possible makes things
worse not better, since you are limiting the allocation from
performing I/O.  It's clearly a losing situation.
Thanks,
Miklos
