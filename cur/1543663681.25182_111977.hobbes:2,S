Hella Arjan,
I tried it and it looks as if it performs as expected:
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:    1288917      35375    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       8917        244    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
 12:     350644        552    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
 15:          6          0    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 17:     426082       7881   IO-APIC-level  ide2, ide3
 18:     329936        919   IO-APIC-level  eth0, eth1
 20:         43          0   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 21:   10439503          0   IO-APIC-level  eth2
 22:    1596851     122119   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 23:         16          0   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 25:       1304         36   IO-APIC-level  HiSax
 26:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  EMU10K1
NMI:          0          0

Within a few minutes I see the above. The only thing left: I am not able to
produce interrupts from eth2 (tg3) on CPU1. I have not looked at the daemons
policies so far, so maybe this is normal...
It looks interesting. Did you decribe it somewhere?
