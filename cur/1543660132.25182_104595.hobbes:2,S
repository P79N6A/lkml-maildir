I used to use a 7way CD-Changer (a SCSI model) over years. It's quite
simple, no patches requited. I simply had to switch on "Scan all LUNs"
in kernel's config. Then, all four slots appear as separate devices so
you can mount them all (in parallel) and share them (by NFS/SMB/...).
However, because there's actually only one CD drive inside the box,
persormance suck mountains is you access two (or more) CDs at a time,
because they're constantly swapped...
