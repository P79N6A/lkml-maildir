Hi folks
I have trouble with IT8212F raid controller (on Gigabyte boards also known
as GigaRaid) on FedoraCore 3.
There was some problem with building modules but after some fixing Makefile
I succeeded to build module. 
After loading module dmesg shows:
	Found Controller: IT8212 UDMA/ATA133 RAID Controller
	FindDevices: device 0 is IDE
	FindDevices: device 1 is IDE

I found a lot of messages with this subject but I didn't found any final
answer.
I also tried to use iteraid driver from mm tree but situation is same.
Thanks in a advice
Best regards Mile
