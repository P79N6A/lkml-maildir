I think your perception is more wrong than you could ever think.
Montavista would absolutely love all serial ports to be under the
ttyS* naming, especially on ARM where there is a wide variety of
different possibilities - ttyAM, ttySA, ttyPXA, ttyAMA, and so
the list goes on.  It apparantly gives their support department
real headaches.
There are similar feelings from the handhelds.org community.
However, despite people pressing for it, there's yet to be a *sane*
*technical* *solution* to the problem.  All I've seen so far is one
bad hack.
