After multiple try, I must say I get some problems with nmi watchdog.
I can't boot with the options you specified.
The only differences are about :
suppressed CONFIG_DEBUG_RT_LOCKING_MODE : the kernel doesn't compile.
I get the following traces :
One avec crash in udev. Another with crash in hotplug.
I tried nmi_watchdog=1 and 2 without success.
I send you the .config too.
The machine is an HP workstation xw8200
I hope this mail is not too big.
