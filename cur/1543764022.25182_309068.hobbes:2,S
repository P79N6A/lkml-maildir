I have now played with the fakephp driver and have a better
understanding of these interactions, but I still have questions.  With
the current structure there is a problem because everything is
"cleaned-up" with the tpm_remove function even if userspace has the
device open when the tpm's slot is removed and then there are problems
on subsequent reads/writes. The get/put didn't really stop this from
happening.  Is it right to fix this by cleaning mostly up and placing a
flag in the read/write path to check for this condition?
This problem actually becomes more complicated.  Since the TPM lives on
the LPC bus and does not have it's own id we were in the process of
converting the driver to not use a pci_driver structure at all like the
example in drivers/char/watchdog/i8xx_tco.c.  This is desirable so that
the driver does not claim the id and other drivers can still find their
devices that also live on the LPC bus and thus share the same ID.
Without a pci_driver structure there is no probe or remove functions and
thus the driver is not alerted of the loss of hardware.  Any
recommendations of how to handle this situation?
Thanks,
Kylie
