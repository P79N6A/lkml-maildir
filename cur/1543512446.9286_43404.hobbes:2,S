Hi,
I get the following error message when I try to load the SCSI-module:
root@legolas:/usr/src/linux/Documentation # insmod scsi_mod
/lib/modules/2.3.20/scsi/scsi_mod.o: unresolved symbol init_task_union
I also tried 2.3.19 and had the same problem but I don't know when it
was introduced -- sorry.
My gcc i 2.7.2.3 an the other tools are all newer than required in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes
Compiling SCSI-support into the kernel works fine.
Hope someone can help,
- Konrad
