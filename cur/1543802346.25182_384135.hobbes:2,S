A couple of reboots later with git6 and at this stage it seems all OK, no oopses.
I'm still having 100% repeatable "soft" hangs when booting up though, both with 
-mm2 (-mm1 seems OK in this regard) and git6.  It's enough to make git6 and mm2 
unusable because the machine never finishes booting userspace.  I'll put more 
details of that in another email following up to the original -mm2 thread, as 
it's unrelated to the oops above (but probably equally as nasty).
But it means I can't test the git6 fixes much more because every time I boot it 
I have to alt-sysrq S+U+B or uncleanly kill the box by hitting the reset button.
