Per-CPU tasklets are equivalent to softirqs, with extra complexity and 
overhead ontop of it :-)
so please just introduce a rebalance softirq and attach the scheduling 
rebalance tick to it. But i'd suggest to re-test on the 4096-CPU box, 
maybe what 'fixed' your workload was the global serialization of the 
tasklet. With a per-CPU softirq approach we are i think back to the same 
situation that broke your system before.
