As far as I know, they plan on doing things like 
disk partition detection outside the kernel, i.e. in
a userspace program.  That clearly require
a initrd (or similiar) for anybody with root
on a partitioned disk.
Lots of other bootup initialization, like DHCP,
might move to userspace as well.  This gives a smaller
and safer kernel.
I cannot see this requiring modules though.  Even a
kernel without any module support at all should
work fine for those who compile their own.
Redhat and other distributors may be interested in
shipping a completely modular kernel that
loads modules from that initrd, but that certainly
won't be a _requirement_ for all kernels.
