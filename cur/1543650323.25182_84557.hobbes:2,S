Thanks to Andrew Morton, Andreas Gruenbacher, and others who tested and
made some last-minute cleanups to the ext2/3 patches while I (and
Linus!) were enjoying the warm sun of the Carribean.
The following patches are taken from Andrew Morton's 2.5.44-mm6, with
these changes:  (1) Updated to patch against BK-current, (2) folded the
bugfix ext2-mount-fix.patch into ext23-acl-xattr-11.patch, where it
belongs.
I believe these patches to be ready for inclusion into the 2.5/6 tree.
They've been in Andrew's tree for a while, and should be quite safe if
they are not enabled via CONFIG_EXT[23]_* options.  Linus, please apply.
An updated set of all of these patches can be found at:

P.S.  Some pictures from the Geekcruise <grin> can be found at:

Not all of them are up yet; only the pictures from the first 2/3 of the
cruise are there.  The rest should follow shortly.
