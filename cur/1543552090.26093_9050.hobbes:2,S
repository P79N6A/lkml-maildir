	There are now two things running.
	- Post individual messages to *all* subscribers
	  (to find misbehaving autoresponder(s))
	- Do that with MX verifier -- turning on a flag
	  forcing also successes to be reported to the people.
	The uninteded double-reports are due to me having the script
	running in two instances for a moment.  I thought I SIGTERMed
	the first one immediately when it showed a nuisance detail in
	online monitoring feature, but alas, things were not so.
	In the future the MX verifier will report only cases with
	problems to the users who are likely to encounter them.
