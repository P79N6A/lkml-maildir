matroxfb-compile-error.patch was a valid fix for a compile problem. It 
was against 2.6.11-bk10, therefore wasn't in the 2.6.11-bk6 or 2.6.11bk7 
you had problems with and didn't cause this mess to begin with.
It appears the problem was more systemic than what I saw during my 
compile, thus the fbdev-kconfig-fix-for-macmodes-and-ppc.patch probably 
fixes the problem I fixed and a host of others.  Of course it conflicts 
with my patch.
Please drop the matroxfb-compile-error.patch and if the problem isn't 
truly fixed by fbdev-kconfig-fix-for-macmodes-and-ppc.patch I will 
resend it.
