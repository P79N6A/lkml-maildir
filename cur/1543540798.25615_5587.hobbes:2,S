I noticed after a few days of work that with 2.4.0-pre5 I cannot
get files from the cdrom.  I can mount and unmount it, I see
something like the top level directory, but attempt to access
most of the files result in read error, and these messages in
syslog:
Aug  5 02:23:44 pccross kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Aug  5 02:23:44 pccross kernel: 0b:00: rw=0, want=448196, limit=174676
Eventually some files can be read and apparently are intact.
If I unmount cdrom and mount another, I see directory from the
previous one!  Disks are ISO9660 with RockRidge, drive is SCSI
Plextor on ncr83c810 adapter, SMP system.
