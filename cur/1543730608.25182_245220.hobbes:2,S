/sys/block/sda/queue/max_sectors_kb was set to 512, trying it at 256. 
Hard to say whether it is helping or not. Looking at dmesg I do see some 
traces for scsi_request in the range of 39 - 72 usec. However, anything 
higher (up to 115 usec) could be masked by one of the netif_skb 
latencies that I am still seeing. Not only that, but I have only caught 
a hand-full of these scsi traces in all of my testing.
