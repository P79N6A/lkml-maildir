Currently requires CAP_IPC_LOCK.  However, this one is already been
done using rlimits (at least via mlock() and friends, SHM_LOCK has
different issue).

Requires CAP_SYS_NICE (but I believe this was a 2.6 feature).

There's a few approaches floating about.  Probably the simplest is to
disable the checks globally, but this will also be less secure.  I have
an example of this in 2.6 if you'd like.
