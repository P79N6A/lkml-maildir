If they are modular their order already changes in some case

You can't unload them in 2.4.

Those cases yes

We can do it the 2.4-ac way - that works with the locking I think. What
might be nicer if it works out is to follow the shutdown/suspend code
approach so that we actually queue the "unplug" into the command stream.

Ditto but I need the thinkpad docking bay working somehow.
