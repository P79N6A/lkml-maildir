Subject: [PATCH] PPC: fix stack alignment for signal handlers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/22/19

Both the PPC32 and PPC64 ABIs specify that the stack should be kept aligned
to 16 bytes.  However, signal handlers on PPC64 are getting run with the
stack misaligned (sp % 16 == 8).  This patch fixes that by ensuring that
the signal frame allocated is a multiple of 16 bytes.  The PPC32 signal
frame structures are already sized appropriately, though it may be wise to
put an __attribute__ on them as well to make sure they stay that way.
In addition to the PPC64 signal frame itself being of misaligned size, the
explicit alignment of the starting stack pointer is also to 8 instead of
16.  I've corrected this as well, so signal frames are aligned even if the
interrupted registers contained a misaligned stack pointer.  
For PPC32 signal handlers, while the frame itself was of properly aligned
size, no alignment of the starting stack pointer was done at all, so that a
signal handler can still get a misaligned stack pointer if the interrupted
registers had one, though the kernel isn't gratuitously misaligning good
ones like it is for PPC64.  I added explicit alignment to fix that.
