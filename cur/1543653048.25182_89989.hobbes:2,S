Subject: [RFC] use of drm on pci radeons in 2.5.x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I noticed that ATI now has quite a few PCI based Radeons.  I also notcied 
that 
the current drm code in the kernel as well as the dri code in the CVS 
Xfree86 
tree has code like:
#if defined(__alpha__) || defined(__powerpc__)
# define PCIGART_ENABLED
#else
# undef PCIGART_ENABLED
#endif
which could also be easily modified to allow for its use on x86, however in 
drivers/char/drm/Kconfig we have this currently:
config DRM_RADEON
    tristate "ATI Radeon"
    depends on DRM && AGP
    help
  Choose this option if you have an ATI Radeon graphics card.  There
  are both PCI and AGP versions.  You don't need to choose this to
  run the Radeon in plain VGA mode.  There is a product page at
  <
http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/radeon32/index.html>.
  If M is selected, the module will be called radeon.o.
My question is that if someone was running on PPC or Alpha or an x86 
chipset 
(and modifies the test mentioned above) with no AGP like the Intel E7500 
and 
was using a Radeon with PCI (like the PCI 7500) why should they have to 
enable 
AGP in Kconfig just to get the Radeon DRM driver, other drm drivers like 
the Rage128 and the 3dfx don't require AGP to be configured first?  
Thanks.
