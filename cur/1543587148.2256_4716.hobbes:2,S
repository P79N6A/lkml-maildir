The system entry/exit/context switch is slower. The add_timer/mod_timer is
only
a little bit slower in the case a new soonest timer event has been created.
 I
think you can forget the additional overhead for add_timer/mod_timer, its
the
additional path length on the system entry/exit that might be problematic.
