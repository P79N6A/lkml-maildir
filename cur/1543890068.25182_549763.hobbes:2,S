Program Access Lists (PALs) were* a feature of UNICOS. PALs could
contain not only the list of programs that could use them, but what
attributes the processes required as well. Further, you could
restrict or raise privilege based on the uid, gid, MAC label, and
privilege state of the process during exec based on the PAL.

Yep, but you still have the label based system issues, the classic
case being the text editor that uses "creat new", "unlink old",
"rename new to old". When the labeling scheme is more sopisticated
than "object gets label of subject" label management becomes a major
issue.

Protecting special data is easy. Protecting arbitrary data is the
problem.

Not a bad one, and it would be an easy and fun LSM to create.
If I were teaching a Linux kernel programming course I would
consider it for a class project.
