Heh.  Take a look at anyone who's using real initramfs for their boot
process.  Not initrd, not kernel-without-any-preboot-fs, but real
initramfs.  For them, if kinit/klibc will be in kernel, nothing changes,
because their initramfs *replaces* in-kernel code and future supplied-
with-kernel-klibc-based-kinit.  So if you'll move swsusp into kinit,
it WILL break setups for those users!.. ;)
And with time, amount of such users increases.  Because everyone's
switching from initrd to initramfs; or because everyone's starting
using initramfs (not initrd as "obsolete") since their systems now
require some sort of custom stuff while mounting root (like firmware
loading, or device-mapper setup for sata pseudo-raids, or whatever).
Oh well.
