   The only thing that worries me in all this is Dave's request to
   make device destruction asynchronous,
Not a request, they already are asynchronous today in 2.5.x
unregister_netdevice() rips the device out and returns, and
the problems we need to fix to make this work %100 are problems
that exist regardless of whether things operate asynchronously
or not.
For example, crap like this was always busted:
	rmmod eth0 </proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/whatever
and now the asynchornous model forces us to fix this.
Werner, don't turn this into another one of those absolutely
rediculious discussions about module semantic threads you
guys all pile-drove into Rusty several months ago.  That stuff
stunk like pure shit and really unfairly drove Rusty up a wall.
It really showed how pointless linux-kernel discussion can
be and how much such rediculious discussions can totally impede
real progress because someone LOUD disagrees with someone's
game plan.
