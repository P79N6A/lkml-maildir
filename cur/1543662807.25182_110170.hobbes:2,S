Not sure.
In theory, apm must be able to initiate suspend & resume. But by the
same theory, apm bios should be doing hardware save stating itself --
and it obviously does not.
freeze_processes() should not fail, anyway, so right fix is to wrap
this with freeze_processes() and resume_processes().
Alternate fix is to invent level 6 and use it for apm. Things like ide
would then ignore level 6 (as apm is likely to do the right thing in
that case).

Ok.

Strange, it was there for me, IIRC.

Yep, lapic seems okay.
