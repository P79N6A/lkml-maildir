It's some crap thrown together for the express purpose of
running a command-shell with root privileges on a system
being attacked. The binary load is usually fed in using
some kind of exploit such as overwriting a buffer in some
privileged program.
You fix that problem by upgrading any program found to
be susceptible to attack. If you have an old system, you
might wish to upgrade:
inetd
sendmail
ftpd
tftpd
/usr/sbin/in.*
dump
... and any other program that runs suid.
In particular, do not run inetd. Run xinetd instead.
You can check for a common 'root attack', if you have inetd,
by looking at the last few lines in /etc/inetd.conf.
It may have some access port added that allows anybody
who knows about it to log in as root from the network.
It will look something like this:
# End of inetd.conf.
4002 stream tcp nowait root /bin/bash --
In this case, port 4002 will allow access to a root shell
that has no terminal processing, but an attacker can use this
to get complete control of your system. FYI, this is a 5-year-old
attack, long obsolete if you have a "store-bought" distribution
more recent.

Yes. These are kernel threads.
