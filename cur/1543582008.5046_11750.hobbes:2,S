Hello,
yesterday i successfully set up Linux-2.2.18 on a new machine 
(Pentium-III-667, D-Link 530TX (via-rhine) network-card, 256MB Ram).
The system is now running for about 1 day, and now i get lot's of these messages :
eth0: Something Wicked happened! 2008.
This happened on another machine a few months ago (never appeared again for months now).
What does this mean?? Is my NIC damaged??
Thanx a lot,
  Thomas
