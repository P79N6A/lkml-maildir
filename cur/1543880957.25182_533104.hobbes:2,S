Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything there which I can autopull
into the -mm tree.  I'm presently set up for quilt trees in open
directories and for git trees.  I could add plain-old-gzipped-diffs or
whatever.

This seems to be to do with some silly spamfilter issue or something.  I
sent an email off-list.

We can address that sort of thing via review: you send send the diffs out,
we read them and comment on them.  We do this 100 times a day - it is
simply a non-issue, as long as there's actually someone who has the
time/effort/inclination to push this feature to completion, which is what
kgdb has sadly lacked for the past decade or so.

Lots of people want kgdb.  One person is famously less keen on it, but
we'll be able to talk him around, as long as the patches aren't daft.

Yes, a git tree on k.org is appropriate - let's make that happen.
But beware that it will need to be updated pretty reguarly, and it'll need
to be against Linux-tree-of-the-day, please.  The x86 code continues to
change at a tremendous rate (I count 204 x86 patches queued for 2.6.22),
and kgdb supports lots of other architectures too.
So whoever is signed up to maintain this will have quite a bit of messy
maintaneance to do during the getting-it-ready phase.  This will of course
be minimised by being VERY careful to mimimise the impact of the patchset
on the existing code.
And if/when it is merged, there will be quite a bit of tricky maintenance
work to do, if my experience of the kgdb stub is anything to go by.
There inevitably will be long-term low-level impact upon the arch
maintainers too.  But that's OK, because the way to merge this feature is
to put the arch-neutral core into the tree first, and to then send each
per-arch patch to the relevant arch maintainer for merging.  That way, they
get to decide whether they wish to take on the burden of participating in
its long-term maintenance.
