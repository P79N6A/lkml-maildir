    My laptop already has such a mixer control (and it works too,
though it does depend on pcspkr being loaded).  Have there been bug
reports about PC speakers that don't work because the PC speaker mixer
control was not unmuted?  Well, probably, but it's not a new
situation.
    It doesn't seem unreasonable to me to expect users to configure
their PC speaker beep preference through the ALSA mixer when
configuring the PC speaker to be an audio device.
    I would think the ideal situation would be to make every ALSA
device capable of acting as the console bell (defaulting to muted,
like every other ALSA mixer control).  Then only pcspkr would be the
odd case (though maybe a common one).
    I dunno if there's a reasonably easy way to do that (without
changing every ALSA driver) though.
