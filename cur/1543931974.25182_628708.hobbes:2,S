I am using gcc-4.2.1
CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y makes no difference for me.
$ make defconfig
$ egrep "OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE|CONFIG_SMP" .config
CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y
CONFIG_SMP=y
$ make vmlinux
$ nm -v vmlinux|grep -4 random_read_wakeup_thresh
c057a02c d excluded_id_list
c057a100 d zero_bdi
c057a180 D random_table
c057a300 d input_pool
c057a400 d random_read_wakeup_thresh
c057a404 d random_write_wakeup_thresh
    <SAME HOLE HERE>
c057a480 d blocking_pool
c057a580 d nonblocking_pool
c057a680 d rekey_work
After my patch, I still gain 120 bytes.
Please realize that most people now build their kernels with CONFIG_SMP=y, or 
use a distro one (with CONFIG_SMP=y as well)
Your CONFIG_SYSCTL point is valid and should be addressed by a separate patch set.
