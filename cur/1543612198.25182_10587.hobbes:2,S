Hi,
my notebook is a Gericom Hydrospeed with AMD-K6-2 and VT82CXXX Chipset.
The notebook produces a complete system hangup if I use the cd-drive, make
apm --suspend and by the next cdrom usage its frozen. There is no
error-message oder something else.
You can find my kernel config under
http://www.hetzi.at/hetzi/config-gericom-2.4.16
Under 2.4.14 and other kernels before was no such hangup.
Thanks
Hetzmannseder Markus
