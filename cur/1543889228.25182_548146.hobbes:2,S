How often do that happen?
There is the alternate solution of assuming that EDID is correct,
and provide an override when it isn't. So anyone with a good monitor
get a nice display by default.  Those with a defective lying monitor
may have to add a "resolution=640x480" parameter to their
kernel command line to get out of the black screen modus.
This shifts the bother to those with a bad monitor, who then are
free to get pissed off at their monitor vendor . . .
