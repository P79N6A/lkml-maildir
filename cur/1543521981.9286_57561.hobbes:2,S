I run my program, it opens the file.  The program will either open
the file in a way that *ensures* a genuine new file is created,
or the next step will be testing wether I got a genuine file
or some hackish symlink.
Seems to me the former can be achieved by using O_NOFOLLOW.
The latter can be achieved by running fstat against the opened file,
and closing the file if it turns out to be a symlink.
The program may then give up or retry with some other filename.
Putting this logic in every program may be time-consuming.  If so,
consider putting it in a shared library.
Even 32-bit random pids won't save sloppy programming.  I can create,
say
2 million links in /tmp.  Then I have a 1 to 1000 chance of
catching the programs that thinks the pid is a safe filename.  How often
do I
get the chance?  Every boot?  Every time some kind of connection comes
in?
