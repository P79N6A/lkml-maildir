Err.... The American National Standard for information Systems, under
the American National Standards Institute, ANSI, approved a "Small
Computer System Interface" (SCSI) standard on June 23, 1986.
There have been many revisions, one of the last, called SCSI-2, was
approved on May 20, 1991. I used to sit on the committee. I have some
of the original drafts.
Although I haven't been involved for over 8 years, it us unlikely that
the word "SCSI" has been given up as some generic aspirin. SCSI still
means the stuff specified in the 519 Page document copyrighted by
ANSI, called "SMALL COMPUTER SYSTEM INTERFACE - 2", Dated May 20, 1991,
and the first draft released in June of 1986.
As such, you are not supposed to use the word SCSI to mean "control packet
interface" or whatever. It is supposed to refer to the hardware and
communications specifications (software), defined by the standard.
Although nobody is likely to haul is into court, we should not be using
SCSI to mean anything else.
And, SCSI does not "specify" hot-plug. It's just not covered in the
standard. However, you can certainly provide capabilities not covered
by a particular standard. It is some implementation details on how
SCSI (and other) devices are mounted, connected, disconnected, and
controlled that may allow hot-plugging.
