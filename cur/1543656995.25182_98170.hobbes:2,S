Here's a contest run comparing 2.5.52-mm2 on the same osdl hardware with the 
ext3 partitions mounted ext2 for comparison:
noload:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          39.2    181     0       0       1.08
2552mm2ext2 [5]         39.1    180     0       0       1.08
not significant
cacherun:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          36.5    194     0       0       1.01
2552mm2ext2 [5]         36.1    194     0       0       1.00
slight speedup here. 
process_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          46.5    152     8       41      1.28
2552mm2ext2 [5]         48.3    144     10      48      1.33
slight shift in the balance; no significant change
ctar_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          52.8    154     1       10      1.46
2552mm2ext2 [5]         47.2    163     1       7       1.30
speedup with better overall cpu usage with ext2
xtar_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          76.1    124     1       8       2.10
2552mm2ext2 [5]         95.6    101     1       5       2.64
interesting - a shift in the opposite direction here with ext2 much slower 
(large)
io_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          74.5    112     11      20      2.06
2552mm2ext2 [5]         77.4    118     11      13      2.14
same here
io_other:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          59.9    134     6       18      1.65
2552mm2ext2 [5]         52.8    137     6       11      1.46
slightly better with ext2
read_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          50.5    147     5       6       1.39
2552mm2ext2 [5]         49.3    149     5       6       1.36
slightly better ext2
list_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.5.52-mm2 [7]          43.7    167     0       9       1.21
2552mm2ext2 [5]         43.4    166     0       9       1.20
mem_load:

2.5.52-mm2 [7]          66.0    141     39      3       1.82
2552mm2ext2 [5]         63.9    145     38      3       1.76
slightly better here
It seems the (possibly?) faster writing with ext2 causes slowdowns under heavy 
writing loads on the same disk, but improvements with the other loads.
Interesting results (not quite what I was expecting)
Enjoy the festive season
Cheers,
Con
