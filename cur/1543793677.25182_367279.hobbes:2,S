Hi,
In the new tty_buffer structure, flag_buf_ptr is used in addition to the 
char_buf_ptr.  Is this flag_buf_ptr used as an additional buffer to 
extend the character buffer during the use of 
tty_insert_flip_string_flags() API?  When I looked into the 
implementation of the tty_insert_flip_string_flags API in tty_io.c, I 
was little confused.
Also, can any one explain me the function of the free queue head in the 
struct tty_bufhead?
Thanks,
Ananda
