The kernel now includes an implicit msync for each fsync.
In short, before the change an fsync would not find all the dirty pages
of the file, because some of the dirty bits might be "hiding" in the
page tables, while the current kernel actually finds those dirty bits
and writes all dirty data to disk.
Would you rather have the fast fsync, or the one that actually writes
all the dirty data to disk? :)
