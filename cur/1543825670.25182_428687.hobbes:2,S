Splicing a page from one mapping to another is rather worrying/exciting,
but it does look safely done to me.  remove_mapping checks page_count
while page lock and old mapping->tree_lock are held, and gives up if
anyone else has an interest in the page.  And we already know it's
unsafe to lock_page without holding a reference to the page, don't we?
