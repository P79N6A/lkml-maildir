I'm having lots of trouble getting my voodoo 4500 pci to give a good
image in my alpha, and I'm wondering if it works allright on other
architectures.
I'm using 2.4.17pre2 and 3dfx-20010507; and anything where my pixclock
is over max_pixclock / 2 just hangs when booting. I'm trying to get
1600x1200-16@80, which XFree displays just fine. So it should be
possible. I'd like to compare settings with someone who has this
working.
Thanks,
Jurriaan
