I was thinking of total priority points... say for example on a server you
have max 50 interactivity points to share between and deserving processes.
So if I'm running vi and only vi it can get up to 100. I'm thinking of the
priority shown by ps, clearly one process will NOT get that much!
If I have X up and run vi in a window, or do web admin, I'd have more
processes and the max for any one would be lower.
In truth I think 50 sounds more like a desktop, maybe 10-20 for a server?
In any case I think that would be easier to track than CPU percentage, and
what I want to change is who gets the CPU next, not how much they get.
Typing in vi takes nada, but I see 1-5 sec delays in echoing the
character, even without X.
If this was to work, I would think that you would care more for xmms not
skipping than windows moving slowly, assuming that was the trade-off.
YMMV.

Other than I think it's easier to just use the priorities already in place
and diddle them than to track CPU. On the other hand we have CPU and sleep
info. If Ingo or anyone qualified cares enough about this suggestion to
think about it we may get an answer from someone who really knows how this
works.
