It's actually a vector, that's all you can install in the IDT. Also a trap 
doesn't advance the instruction pointer, so you resume at the trapping 
instruction (e.g. vector 14/page fault), 0x80 is an interrupt gate. One 
of the distinguishing differences is that 0x80 may be entered via int 
0x80 from all ring levels. The reason why int 0x80 doesn't disable 
interrupts is because issuing int 0x80 directly is similar to doing a far 
call and therefore doesn't have the same effect as a real interrupt being 
issued.
