Might well be possible, but it's not just CIFS though. I don't see why
CIFS needs phys contig memory, but I think some of the drivers do (at
least they do at the moment). Large pages and hotplug definitely will.

If that's the decision we come to, I'm OK with it ... but lots of code 
needs fixing first. However, I don't think that's currently the stated 
intent, we try pretty hard for up to order 3 in __alloc_pages(). I think 
we'll have an inherent need for higher orders from what I've seen, and 
thus we'll have to be capable to some extent of reclaiming mem for those
allocs. We should probably put together a list of things that really 
need it, Joel had a start at one later down this thread.
