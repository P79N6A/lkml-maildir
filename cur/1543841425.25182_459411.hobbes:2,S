AFAICT, they're both right.  Generally, mmiowb() should be used prior to 
unlock in a critical section whose last PIO operation is a writeX.
You're right though: for portability, many more drivers should use this 
type of barrier.  However, rather than doing an audit of the tree and 
inserting mmiowb() everywhere (w/o testing it), we chose to add it on an 
as-needed basis for drivers that run on platforms that have weak I/O 
ordering.  Feel free to add it in other places if you want though (esp. 
if you have the hardware to test your changes).
