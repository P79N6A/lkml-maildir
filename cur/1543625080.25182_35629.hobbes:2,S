You cannot guarentee that current_nr_sectors will be >= mult_count just
by doing that. One fix I did that was in the kernel for a while was to
just always setup the transfer for mult_count number of sectors at most.
This worked, but meant that we would potentially have to restart (output
command etc from scratch) a command a lot of times.
There a a lot of solutions to the problem, some better than others. The
whole issue boils dow to two things. One is that right after this
starts:
 	taskfile_output_data(drive, pBuf, nsect * SECTOR_WORDS);
you must be ready to handle the next transfer, ie the request state must
be sane. The other is that signalling request completion can get tricky,
as always with pio writes.
