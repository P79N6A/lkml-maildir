I was certainly ignorant of that; but I'm not convinced it eliminates
the potential issue.  For a start, sys_move_pages seems not to involve
mempolicies at all - I don't see what prevents it migrating blockdev
pages away from the only node which has NORMAL memory.

Not as metadata, no.  But someone (let's hope only root, though I may
be wrong on that) can map any part of the block device into userspace.

Again, I'm not convinced: bouncing gets done for the I/O,
but where is it done to meet the filesystem's expectations?
On the other hand, as I said, I've seen no problem myself in practice.
However, if there is no problem, why do block devices demand GFP_USER?
