Sounds to me like you just need to LILO again.  You said you installed
Windows after Linux, which means Windows installed its own bootstrap on the
MBR most likely.  Just boot into Linux and rerun /sbin/lilo (and make sure
you have something in your /etc/lilo.conf that'll let you run Windows --
otherwise you'll have to reinstall Windows most likely).  Reboot and all
should be well.  If that doesn't work, fdisk /dev/hda and make /dev/hda1
bootable (and only that bootable) and try installing LILO on /dev/hda1
instead of /dev/hda, although I can't think of any reason why this would be
necessary.
