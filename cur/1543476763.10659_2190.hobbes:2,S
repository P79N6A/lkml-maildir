timeout*HZ can overflow and produce a bad positive result for
some values of timeout, I think.  Assuming timeout is
a long (I don't have the source handy), how about
      if ((timeout < 0) || (timeout > LONG_MAX/HZ))
              timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
      else if (timeout > 0)
              timeout = (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1;
?
