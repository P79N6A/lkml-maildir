I still think we should experiment with changing the hierarchy:
Rename all the core get_free_page* functions to buddy_*
Make SL*B call into buddy_* with a default order of N (>=0)
Replace the old get_free_page* functions with simple wrappers that
call into SL*B for order <= N or buddy_* for order >= N
This tackles several problems at once:
- fragmentation of SL*B due to small pages
- poor performance of get_free_pages moderate orders
- poor cache-locality for get_free_pages
