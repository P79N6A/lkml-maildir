Hi Christian
I don't know why the high load on xtpic except maybe heaps of spurious irq's 
under the hood.
I am working with 2.4.26-rc2 and have noticed a change with the the recent acpi?
update. The recent fix to stop unnecessary ioapic irq routing entries puts the 
following if statement into io_apic.c, io_apic_set_pci_routing()
	/*
	 * IRQs < 16 are already in the irq_2_pin[] map
	 */
	if (irq >= 16)
		add_pin_to_irq(irq, ioapic, pin);
which prevents my io-apic patch from using that function to reprogram the
io-apic pin on irq0 from pin2 to pin0. 
As a quick fix you could drop the "if (irq >= 16)".
I don't know what harm if any that would do other than create unwanted
irq mapping entries as in the past.
As a better solution to work with the new code I have created a function to
change the pin an irq comes into the io-apic on and also re-initialise the 
io-apic to deal with the change. 
Here is the function for 2.4.26-rc2.
/*
 * reroute irq to different pin clearing old and enabling new
 */
static void __init replace_IO_APIC_pin_at_irq(unsigned int irq,
						int oldapic, int oldpin,
						int newapic, int newpin)
{
	struct IO_APIC_route_entry entry;
	unsigned long flags;
	/*
	 * read oldapic entry
	 */
	spin_lock_irqsave(&ioapic_lock, flags);
	*(((int*)&entry) + 0) = io_apic_read(oldapic, 0x10 + 2 * oldpin);
	*(((int*)&entry) + 1) = io_apic_read(oldapic, 0x11 + 2 * oldpin);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ioapic_lock, flags);
	/*
	 * Check delivery_mode to be sure we're not clearing an SMI pin
	 */
	if (entry.delivery_mode == dest_SMI)
		return;
	/*
	 * clear oldpin on oldapic
	 */
	clear_IO_APIC_pin(oldapic, oldpin);
	/*
	 * reroute irq to newpin on newapic
	 */
	replace_pin_at_irq(irq, oldapic, oldpin, newapic, newpin);
	/*
	 * Enable newpin on newapic
	*/
	spin_lock_irqsave(&ioapic_lock, flags);
	io_apic_write(newapic, 0x10 + 2*newpin, *(((int *)&entry) + 0));
	io_apic_write(newapic, 0x11 + 2*newpin, *(((int *)&entry) + 1));
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ioapic_lock, flags);
}
I am now using this instead of the io_apic_set_pci_routing().
My modified check_timer() to work with it is as follows.
/*
 * This code may look a bit paranoid, but it's supposed to cooperate with
 * a wide range of boards and BIOS bugs.  Fortunately only the timer IRQ
 * is so screwy.  Thanks to Brian Perkins for testing/hacking this beast

This version loops twice on the "pin1" attempt, firstly trying the bios assigned
pin, then trying pin0 with no timer acks and the 8259 xtpic disabled.
I have not as yet downloaded 2.6.5xxx
From memory this 2.4.26-rc2 code should be very similar to the (2.6.5-linus)
but a bit different to the -mm series. For the -mm series I think you can drop
the "timer_ack=" lines from my changes as it still has Maciej Rozycki's 8259 
ack patch? The timer ack should already have been correctly set to off by it's
checking if the apic is an integrated one.
Here are the changes as a diff on the io_apic.c in 2.4.26-rc2
