There are a few different sides to the block allocator work. 
1) don't ruin what the current allocator is good at (desktop esp).  A
sequential tree read of freshly copied data is really fast right now. 
It could be a little better with some metadata readahead, I'm still
trying to safely revive that code.
The patch tries to keep performance for a full tree read by with the -o
packing_groups option.  The basic idea is to reuse bitmap groups for new
subdirectories until the bitmap group is full.  This is done by checking
to see how full a given part of the btree is.
2) Improve the fragmentation under multiple writers.   With 20 writers,
the default allocator breaks down, fragmenting badly (20% or so).  The
patch with -o alloc=skip_busy:dirid_groups on makes things sane (3%).
So, to help test, you need some way of measuring fragmentation and a
whole bunch of benchmarks.  I like fibmap:

)
But Andrew has a fragmentation tool in the ext2 cvs I think.
