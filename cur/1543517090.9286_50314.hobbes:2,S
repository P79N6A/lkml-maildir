Subject: APM fault: NEC versa LX, suspend, IDE DMA timeout/KB+MS loss

somewhere in the recent 2.3 kernels, something related to apm broke.
When resuming from standby, the system responds for a few seconds then
locks up.  if i let the laptop sit, it will eventually return to
standby/suspend state from which i can tap a key and get the screen
back.  however, the OS is broken.
the pcmcia card, a linksys nic/modem remains in unpowered or inactive
state i assume because the LEDs remain off.  the LEDs for the keyboard
status do not update with scroll/caps.  the hardware does appear to
respond to function keys such as power level, contrast, etc.
with 2.3.26 iirc, after resuming, i could type for about four-five
seconds then i would get an err msg similar to "hda: DMA timed out" then
lockup.  with more recent, i don't get that message, it simply locks up.
going back to 2.2 and resume works fine.  i haven't found anything
immediately evident in apm code.  if anyone has any quick ideas, toss
'em out.
here's how i normally run it.  pcmcia is compiled in, i've used a few
updated versions.  i've tried full blown with all options, i've tried
stripped down kernels.
