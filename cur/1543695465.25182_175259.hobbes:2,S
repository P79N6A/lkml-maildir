SIGEMT is kgdb's way of telling you the kernel oopsed.  The different
signal types used to convey useful information (a different type for NMI
watchdog expiry, for example).  But George then randomised them and I've
never worked out the new scheme...
kgdb is difficult to use with kernel modules.  There's probably a way of
doing it in 2.6 but I've never sat down and worked it out.  But as you
appear to be working on the SCSI core that's not a problem.
