Parto, you can apply this patch against 2.2.13:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.13/java-proc.gz
Alan could you backout the pid/fd semantical change from the 2.2.x tree
too? There was no underlying bug. Of course I see the userspace security
improvement in the long term but that can be achieved as well with 2.3.x.
