enable a few different types of encryption and you have to enlarge the 
buffer (by quite a bit). the fact that all the encryption tests print 
several lines each out and can't be turned off (short of a quiet boot 
where you loose everything) is one of the more annoying things to me right 
now.
this large boot message issue also slows your boot significantly if you 
have a fast box that has a serial console, it takes a long time to dump 
all that info out the serial port.
