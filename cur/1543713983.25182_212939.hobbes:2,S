This is correct, although I don't know why there would be
performance problems. The rebalance in the degenerate node-local
domain should be basically unmeasurable. It would be nice to
get rid of it at some time. I have code to prune off degenerate
domains, which I will submit soonish.
The NUMA rebalance should occur more often than the old numasched
did, but perhaps with some recent Altix-centric changes to the
generic setup, this is no longer the case.
The STREAM performance problem is due mainly to the more
conservative nature of balancing, which is otherwise a good thing.
I think we can fix this in the short term by having x86_64 balance
between nodes more often. In the long term, we can merge Ingo's
balance on clone stuff, and the interested people can play with
that.

I guess I can't see a big problem with this, other than more
complexity. In the long run, we should obviously have the arch
code set up optimal domains depending on the machine and config.

SGI want to do sub arch domains so they can do specific things
with their systems. I don't really care what the arch code does
with them, but it would be wise to only specialise it when there
is a genuine need. I'm glad you'll be looking into it, thanks.
