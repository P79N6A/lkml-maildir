Hi,
I've been trying to compile kernel 2.3.48 this morning and ran into
some problems in parport_pc.o
Specifically, the output from make is
--8<----------------------------------
ld -m elf_i386 -T /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds -e stext arch/i386/kernel/head.o arch/i386/kernel/init_task.o init/main.o init/version.o \

--8<----------------------------------
I assume the problem has something to do with not selecting
CONFIG_PCI?  I don't have PCI so I don't select that option.
I looked at the code and I couldn't figure it out, so I thought
I should post here.
Here's my kernel configuration:
