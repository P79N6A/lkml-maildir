Hi,
After the 5th thread of how to use Linux with more than 1 GB
of RAM, I've decided to put together a small HOWTO-like
document that describes (in an easy way) the issues involved
and how to work around/solve the problem in a few easy steps.
You can read/review the document at:
<
http://www.phys.uu.nl/~riel/mm-patch/more_than_1GB.html>
At this stage, I'd like a few comments and additions. I
plan on announcing the thing (and modifying Documentation/*)
sometime next week, so don't feel hurried :)
cheers,
Rik -- the flu hits, the flu hits, the flu hits -- MORE
