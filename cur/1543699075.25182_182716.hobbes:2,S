Thanks for the explanation, Linus.
I modified my benchmark to use mmap(2) instead of read(2) and the
results are broadly comparable.  With a 10MB window, I get 331 MB/s
reading out of buffer cache and 185 MB/s reading a hole.  Reading a file
too large to cache is about the same (disk-limited) speed, 43 MB/s.
