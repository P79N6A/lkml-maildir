Ugh. Knowing this will save me from downloading, burning and testing the
32 bit Ubuntu distro, whose 2.6.27 kernel will surely use that default
configuration.
I'll perform more tests, with more debug kprintf()'s, anyway.
Do you remember if the cases Gary's patches were trying to fix included
ranges rolling past the 32-bit address limit (end address below start
address)?
