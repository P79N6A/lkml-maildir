   You are contradicting to yourself.
   I have participated in creation of two specialized embedded systems, 
and currently going into third one.
   Every system were need some specialized shutdown sequence.
   None of them were need power saving.
   Please do not generalize your particular system to everything else.
   No one needs another self-aware self-configurable software subsystem, 
which intended to do the task of the engineers. Especially when this 
task takes 15 minutes to code.
