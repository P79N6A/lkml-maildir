All true, but the reason it "works" is that malloc WILL allocate some memory,
even if it's only a few bytes of header.:
       |       |   (other memory block controled by malloc/free...)
       |-------|
       | header|
       |       |    - address returned to program
       | next  |
       | header|    (next memory block...)
Now the strcpy may have copied the string "fffff" over the next header.
The copy worked, the printf worked (its buffers were already allocated...)
BUT... If you allocate more memory via malloc, you will get an error
(eventually). I believe malloc(0) allocates 4 bytes as a minimum, though
this particular call IS undefined. You also did not check to see if
malloc did return something (It did, or you would have gotten a segmentation
fault from writing to location 0 with strcpy).
