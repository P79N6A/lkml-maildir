# Store contents of IDT into idtr, in space you own. Okay so far even
though '.double' isn't correct. It should be:
.section .bss
idtr:	.long[2]
.section .text

This should put the PHYSICAL address of the base into ebx.

Now you are going to sum the physical address in ebx with 0x80 and 8
index, putting the result into ebx. Hmmm...

Now you are going to access something in some strange location that
is either not mapped or you don't own.

In the first place, addresses in the IDT are physical. They are mapped
in an area where there is a 1:1 correspondence between virtual and
physical. You either need to set DS to that descriptor before you
access (where the page-table is, I forget its name) it or mmap that
address so you can access it.
