Well, it requires patches still. I hope 2.5.47 will contain everything you
need. As of this moment, there is no set of patches that will apply cleanly
to bitkeeper HEAD to give you working IPSEC, unless you manage to check out
a tree from Thursday morning CET.
Perhaps dave can re-diff?
I'm writing documentation on 
http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.ipsec.html
 which
explains how to set everything up.
