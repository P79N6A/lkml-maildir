This is a *totally* bogus and idiotic argument.
x86-64 will get new capabilities, BUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OLD 
x86-64 machines.
And those machines are basically identical to perfectly regular i386 
platforms.
So the whole argument that it would "diverge" is total crap. It obviously 
won't diverge, simply because the support for old setups is needed on 
x86-64 *regardless* of whether 32-bit support exists on the same platform 
or not.
There's a huge difference between divergence and "more capabilities".
