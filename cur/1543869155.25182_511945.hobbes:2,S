Sure.  Please report all inconveniences (they're really bugs) so we can 
fix them.
Poking at kvm internals means you waste your time learning them, and 
later we can't change them.

I think the expensive part of signals is userspace delivery.  If they 
are always blocked in userspace, they become just another IPC channel.
I plan to add a signal mask to KVM_RUN a la pselect() so that userspace 
can dequeue signals instead of using a signal handler.

Can't it be done by a helper function using a timer and a signal (or 
whatever mechanism we use to wake up vcpus)?
