The "nice" inner loop is necessary or else it would generate huge amounts
of bus traffic while spinning.

A while ago I showed that spinlocks were a lot more fair when doing
unlock with the xchg instruction on x86. Probably the arbitration is all
screwed up because we use a mov instruction, which while atomic is not
locked.
