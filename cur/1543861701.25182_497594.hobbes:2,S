This is not a 'new' distribtution. In fact, the disk was used for a 
previous hardware box, of the same
manufacturer and allegedly the same cpu mother board.
The kernel is 2.6.19.1 the at-that-moment current linux kernel.
What should I look for in terms of interface renaming. What is also sort 
of strange is that they all
have the same 'mac' address vendor unique id... even though two 
interfaces are for an Intel
ethernet chip, and the othe 4 are from the Marvel chip.
Thanks
