Yep. We have prefetch_range.

Yeah, I mean within mm, ie. prefetch(&mm->random_cacheline).

I thought the concrete example there was ia64's switch_stack,
which looks to be over half a K... oh I see you've asked Ken
whether this will be sufficient. OK in that case let's wait and
see.

Well to be clear, I think we have always agreed, except that I
thought it 'did happen' with the ia64 example. If it turns out
that your prefetch is good enough then I will have been mistaken.
Actually to be even clearer, I was never really arguing about what
to prefetch or whether to prefetch from arch code or not. Just that
the name, if any, should be prefetch_task as opposed to
prefetch_stack :)
