I'm going to now that 2.4.X is coming out. I'm going to work on the new
API at the linuxconsole project. This time we will be ready as soon as
2.5.0 is out. Also the code well be well test and somewhat stable when it
will be time to intergrate it into 2.5.0.

Think mulithead. You are VT 1 which is mapped to your workstations.
Someone else is on another real seperate head. In a office situation you
could have a machine in one room with monitor and keyboard extension
cables running into seperate office. You shouldn't be able to VT switch to
the second head. Especially if someone is using it in another office down
the hall. If you do then will you feel like running into another office
when you VT switch to a display thats not in front of you. So you have to
add another layer of checking. If each head had its own seperate VT pool
you don't need to work about migrating to another head. No eaxtra layer of
checking. No need to run to another head, especially if its in a
seperate room. Also if one head is vgacon and another head is fbcon
this is okay. They are seperate vidoe cards.

I like to see VT features moved from fbdev to the console system. 
It doesn't matter now. 2.4.X is coming out and I'm already looking to
develope a branch to merge with 2.5.0 when it comes out.

Things do break in development branches. Mostly for good reasons. Well now
that its 2.4.0 these changes can't happen its to late in the ball game.
Next branch it will. This will give people time to adjust their code.

For a bunch of VTs (pool) only one VT is active. Well thats the way it
should be. You can think of it as a console context switch. On a context
switch you save the current state and restore another state.

Because /dev/fb is NOT /dev/tty.

No. If you set the colormap via fbdev its sets the colormap of the current
terminal. Use VT ioctl to change colormap of another terminal not fbdev.
I don't ask to copy data in this case. Copying data around happens only on
VT switch. Please read what I stated in vfb.c very carefully.

Yet more code added instead of removed :(

That is full of crap and you know it. Well all I have to say is thsi API
will be in the devleopement branch and people can see for themselves how
much easier it will be.

For now. No reason for it be that way.

You want VT mode info for a non active VT use the ioctl in vt.c to
get this info. Look at the vt.c for ioctl avaliable now. 
NO MORE ARUGING!!! I think I have made my point.
