That is true. What some devices will be unable to do is suspend
and resume in a manner that is transparent to the application.
However, for the duration required to re-arrange pages it is 
definitely feasible to do so transparently to the application.
Presumably the Virtual Memory Manager would be more willing to
take an action that is transparent to the user than one that is
disruptive, although obviously as the owner of the physical memory
it has the right to do either.
