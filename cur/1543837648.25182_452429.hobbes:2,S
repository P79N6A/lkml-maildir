Yes that is what I said. SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is RCU applied to the "whole 
slab".

Right. This is pretty early for tests though. Its barely functional.

If the overhead of general allocation/free from a slab is reduced then 
this effect should not occur. IMHO it may turn out that the need for 
the shared array is an artifact of the per cpu caches.
