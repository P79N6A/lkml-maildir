On big machines it is currently 1+MB. IMHO this is way too big.

It would be possible to cache line optimize the layout of struct dentry
in addition. May be an interesting add-on project for someone...
But for lookup walking even one cache line - the one containing d_hash -
should be needed. Unless d_hash is unlucky enough to cross a cache
line for its two members ... but I doubt that.

But the list walking is faster.  Testing for NULL generates much better 
code on i386 than having to dedicate a register for storing the head
to test against. List walking happens more often than insertion/deletion.
I believe the conditionals are completely left in the noise compared
to the cache misses the two pointer head version causes. You can execute
a lot of conditionals in the time needed to serve one cache miss!
Please take a look at the x86 assembly generated by list_for_each
vs hlist_for_each. hlist_for_each looks much nicer, especially when you
can use the register normally wasted on the head for something else
in the loop body.
In case of dcache rcu it also made things simpler/faster because it didn't
require the complicated is_bucket race breaker check.

I admit it is a kind of micro optimization, but I believe it is an useful
one. Frankly wasting two pointers for a hash bucket in a potentially
big hash table is just s*d.

Yes, that may be a good idea. I don't have time to work on this though.
Still even with local lookups single pointer buckets will likely help ;)
Also isn't it a bit late in the 2.5 cycle to think about such radical
changes like local lookup? It sounds more like a nice 2.7 project.  I
believe my patch with a bit more tweaking (my current 64K hash table
seems to be too small) is suitable even for an soon to be stable
kernel.
Also my patch had some other changes that I believe should be included
anyways because they're independent and improvement. It replaces the
max_dentries race break hack with a better algorithm to detect cycles on walk.
Also it does more prefetches while list walking which I believe to be 
useful.
