Problem solved: floating point instructions in Atmelwlandriver pcmcia
modules result from three locations in driver source where division by
"1e6" should be division by "1000000L".  Should have looked over code
again before posting, but lack of sleep and attendant frustration made
me lose patience :-(.  Apologies.
