You need to register:
- serio device drivers (the things which drive the hardware) using
  serio_register_port()
- serio protocol drivers (the things which interpret the bytes,
  like atkbd.c) using serio_register_device()
So, for a PS/2 keyboard connected to a some special hardware interface,
you'd use atkbd.c which registers itself with serio using
serio_register_device().  Your device driver for the "special hardware"
registers itself with serio_register_port().
