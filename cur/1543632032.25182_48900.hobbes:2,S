I'm not going to speak to whether this is true in the
current kernels or not.
The read system call is interuptable, period.  Disk access
is considered slow.   If you code asuming it will not be
interupted or that an interupt will cause a return of -1
your code may break on Linux and will certainly not be
portable.
POSIX is ambigious on this and disk reads (on UNIX) have
historically returned partial data when interupted during a
disk read where some of the data was already in buffer.
