It's a tiny bit faster, see

I just ran it once so the graph is not smooth.  This is on a UP dual
core machine.  Maybe tomorrow I'll turn on the big 4p machine.
I would have to see dramatically different results on the big machine to
make me change the libc code.  The reason is that there is a big drawback.
So far, when we allocate a new arena, we allocate address space with
PROT_NONE and only when we need memory the protection is changed to
PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE.  This is the advantage of catching wild pointer
accesses.
