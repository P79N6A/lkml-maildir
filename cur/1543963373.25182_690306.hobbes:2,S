The commit description says:

This bug could be related to the regression reported by Yanmin Zhang:
| Comparing with kernel 2.6.25, sysbench+mysql(oltp, readonly) has lots
| of regressions with 2.6.26-rc1:
|
| 1) 8-core stoakley: 28%;
| 2) 16-core tigerton: 20%;
| 3) Itanium Montvale: 50%.
Reported-by: "Zhang, Yanmin" <yanmin_zhang@linux.intel.com>

Can we get that verified and the description updated before it hits 
Linus' tree?
Otherwise this "could be related" will become unchangable metadata that 
will stay forever - no matter whether there's any relation at all.
Thanks
Adrian
