Having been over the code the problem is indeed the bios reporting overlapping
/duplicated ranges. That will cause a crash in mm/bootmem when we try and free
the range twice.
I suspect you need to add some code to take the E820 map and remove any
overlaps from it, favouring ROM over RAM if the types disagree (for safety),
and filter them before you register them with the bootmem in 
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
