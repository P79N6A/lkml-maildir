I'm afraid you missed the point there.  ioctl or not ioctl is not
important, and yes, ioctls have a lot of problems.  The problem is
having a library define the public interface for kernel services.  I
don't see how come Linus accepted that, unless he doesn't really use
sound and just doesn't care, which is my current interpretation.
  OG.
