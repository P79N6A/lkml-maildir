I think it was Digital UNIX which simply uses the current PATH to find the
interpreter if no absolut path was given - which I think is a cleaner and more
useful solution (and I don't think it's a security risk - if PATH is compromised
security is already damaged, and of course you might specify an absolut path for
the interpreter).
