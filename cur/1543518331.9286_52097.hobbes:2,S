	As a followup to my prev message, the patch *is* part of the
diffserv package, and the command would be
/sbin/ip route add default equalize nexthop via gateway.number.1.ip \
dev ppp0 nexthop via gateway.number.2.ip dev ppp1
/sbin/ip route list gets you
 
 default equalize
         nexthop via 10.65.60.12  dev ppp1 weight 1
         nexthop via 10.65.60.12  dev ppp0 weight 1
