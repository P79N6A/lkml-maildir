I don't know where to get PPC64 capable memtest, even if it exists the
probability of two different machines exhibiting almost the same
behaviour is rather slim. Netconsole doesn't catch anything. In fact
i just had slightly different situation where after ssh connection was
killed i was able to reconnect and look at dmesg there - nothing.
