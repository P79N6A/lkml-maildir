No. I don't agree. userspace has no business understanding the kernel
resources content. All userspace need to care about is the resource
number, and _eventually_ match it to a BAR value (either for using the
old /proc interface -> existing code, or to use it with real inx/outx
instructions on x86).

OK, well, I'll come up with a patch in a few hours doing what I
described anyway, and we'll start from that.
The only thing I dislike a bit is that forces me to read the BAR on
every access to "un-offset" the kernel resource. We may be able to have
some arch hook do that properly, but for now, that would fix the problem
and make the whole stuff work again.
Ben.
