That is what Digital Unix does.  I don't know if others do it this way or
not.  I agree that its an unpleasant solution, but w/o HW vendors being
interested in the non-x86 market, its probably the least bad way of
solving the problem.
I think there is some sort of spec that wants the init code to be written
in forth so you can make a PCI card that will work on both the Mac and the
PC.  I have not heard much about it lately so I don't know if anyone does
this or not.
