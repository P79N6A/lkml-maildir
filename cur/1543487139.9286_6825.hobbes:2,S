This problem is reported many times with newerr kernels.
1) It id definitely not a cdeecord problem.
2) It may go away if you recompile cdrecord so that it adopts to the actual
	values in /usr/src/linux/include/scsi/sg.h
	These values must be the values of the runing kernel due to the
	dump sg uer interface.
3) It should go away if the kernel is compiles with the right values (see above)
4) ... or it may be caused by a loabdable sg driver which cannot get enough
	memory that is suitable for DMA.
I hope this problem will be fixed soon as it causes me much much work
wich could be used better for cdrecord ....
