I agree.  However, SGI seems to have some majorly <insert expletive here>
hardware and drivers that cause this line to release a already released
resource.  See the other part of this patch for the part where this
resource is supposedly freed up.
I took the patch as it doesn't hurt anyone, and it gets them off of my
back.  But if you so much as think this patch isn't needed, I'll gladly
revert it, as I'm really not trusting any PCI hotplug patches coming out
from them anymore...
thanks,
