Sure. Reading /proc/acpi/video/*/*/info should tell you whether a device 
is an LCD or not. The brightness file should then contain a list of 
available brightnesses, and writing one into there should change the 
screen value. There's a patch somewhere that ports this to the 
/sys/class/backlight infrastructure, but I don't think it's applied yet.
I'd write a test up for you, but I don't actually seem to have any 
hardware that implements this properly. Tch.
