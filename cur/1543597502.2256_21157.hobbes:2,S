I'm using 2.4.6 ac2 on a Pentium III 600 Mhz with 384 Mo of memory.
After mounting a ramfs giving the maxsize option a value of 20Mb, I found that
the disk size increase but is not decreasing when files are deleted. Copying
more files give me an not enough space left error message.
Am I the only one with this problem or is it a known bugs, after looking a the
mailing list archive I didn't see any report of this problem.
Thanks
