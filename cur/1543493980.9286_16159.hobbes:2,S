Yes I did the same too, it was part of the original 2.0.20 serial console
patch. At <BREAK>, halt or panic a menu appeared that resembled the
Sun boot monitor a bit - "?" for help, "c" for continue, "b" for
boot, "p" to see the last panic message, "m" for memory, etc ...
I think something like that would be useful as a patch for 2.2.x
My original 2.0.x patch is still at
