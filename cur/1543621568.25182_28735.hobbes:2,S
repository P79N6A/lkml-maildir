I don't know what happend with regard to this.  The owner match module
compiles on my system without any problems on all kernels up to 2.4.18-rc1.
I assume that the 'mjc2' patches change something with regard to the pid 
hash, thus breaking the netfilter module.  Whoever makes this change should
take care of modifying the ipt_owner module.
Since the change is not in the unpatched mainstream kernel, I'm not 
concerned about this.

This is a recent change in the 2.4.18 kernel, removing get_fast_time and
using do_gettimeofday instead.
The time match from iptables-1.2.5 still used the old get_fast_time() function
and needs to be updated.  the time match is a contributed patch from 
Fabrice MARIE <fabrice@celestix.com>, so please ask him to update his patch
to work with recent kernel versions.
