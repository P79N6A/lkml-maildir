Would it not have been much more "obvious" if the rules for
unsigned/signed integer comparisons (irrespective of the widths
involved) were
1) If the signed element is negative then it is always less than the
   unsigned element.
2) If the unsigned element is greater than then maximum positive value
   expressible by the signed one then it is always greater.
3) Only if both values are positive and within the range of the
   smaller element are the actual values compared.
