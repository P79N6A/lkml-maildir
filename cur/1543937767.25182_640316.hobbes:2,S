Actually, isn't the better fix just to return to the original behaviour?
As you pointed out, using the subdir instead of obj meant that although
the modules were built, the drivers were never linked into the main
kernel.  According to the records, this has been the default forever, so
there can be no-one anywhere relying on these drivers being built in.
Actually, as old style pcmcia drivers, I'm not sure there's much value
building them into the kernel anyway.
So just modify scsi/pcmcia/Kconfig to make them all depend on m.
