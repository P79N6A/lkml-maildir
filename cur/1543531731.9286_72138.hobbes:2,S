Go to the "other" ACPI4Linux project, and download their acpid...
http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/
http://phobos.fs.tum.de/acpi/download/acpid-031700.tar.gz
grep for battery :)
I do not know at all how well the current ACPI4Linux software works, if
at all, since it is not the "official" ACPI Linux implementation AFAIk. 
IIRC it used to have a big kernel implementation but was fairly
featureful.  I don't know if that has changed.
