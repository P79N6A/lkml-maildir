1) Created a new syscall for the unsinged setrlimit, not just for
getrlimit.  This should have been done from the very beginning, IMHO.
2) If the old value of RLIM_INFINITY is passed to the old setrlimit,
translate it to the new value of RLIM_INFINITY.  (This would not have
been strictly necessary of glibc wasn't playing RLIM_INIFITY capping
games; as it turns out, if you pass the "new" version of RLIM_INIFITY
to an "old" 2.2 kernel, the right thing happens.  So there really is
no need for glibc to cap the limit of RLIM_INFINITY to the old value.)
3)  RLIMIT_FILESIZE should not apply to block devices!!!
