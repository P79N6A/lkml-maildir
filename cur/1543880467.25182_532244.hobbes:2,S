Ok, here's the dmesg output using the hpt366 old IDE driver,
2.6.21-rc7, SMP: 
[  160.926355] HPT302: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:03:06.0
[  160.928030] ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:03:06.0[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ
 18
[  160.931212] HPT302: chipset revision 1
[  160.932801] HPT302: DPLL base: 66 MHz, f_CNT: 100, assuming 33 MHz PCI
[  160.941157] HPT302: using 66 MHz DPLL clock
[  160.942646] HPT302: 100% native mode on irq 18

Which looks ok to me I guess.  It found my MD disks on there and
assmebled them, eventually.  *grin*
I'll reboot and send out the corresponding ATA HPT37x driver dmesg...
