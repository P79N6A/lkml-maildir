There seams to be a problem in the PCI2000 and PCI2220i
drivers. The won't compile as modules.
I was attempting to build a kernel with support for EVERY
module available just to see. How big the modules would be.
I haven't tried them built-in, but expect the same errors.
It seam they need updates for the new PCI interface, but
there are other errors too.
