I see.  Andrew reverted some stuff to fix his PII (which I broke BTW
it wasn't a problem in your original patches) but he didn't revert everything
only starting from the bisected patch.
Ok on the next resync everything will be dropped there.

Thanks. It's not that urgent because the merge will need a few days
at least.
Also I must admit I haven't figured out yet if yours or Rusty's patchkit
is better. So far I was leaning towards yours, but that might be because
I haven't looked closely at Rusty's version.
