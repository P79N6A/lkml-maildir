Is that the complete modules.conf?  The messages below imply that you
have other options and/or commands in there.

Check syslog for any error messages.  The only unusual thing is that
modprobe is running in safe mode (user supplied input data) which
suppresses some command expansions.  Post your entire modules.conf
exactly as is, i.e. read the file into your mail, do not cut and paste
it.
