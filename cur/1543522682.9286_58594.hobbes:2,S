Subject: need type to carry kernel pointers to user space

Recently, we had a discussion on the linux-atm list about the best approach
for passing kernel pointers to user space, and back. The idea is as follows:
There are a few demon processes which assist the kernel in performing
low-level tasks, a bit like cardmgr and such. The demons and the kernel
communicate about some set of objects (e.g. an ATM connection descriptor).
The reference used to identify that object is a pointer to the kernel's
data structure. The protocol spoken between kernel and demons makes of
course sure that no stale references can be used, and such pointers are
never exposed to regular user programs. This approach allows the kernel
to look up data structures extremely quickly and without any list-walking
and locking issues.
The problem: on some architectures, user space and kernel have different
pointer lengths. E.g.
				unsigned long	void *		long long
i386		kernel		32		32		64
		user space	32		32		64
sparc64		kernel		64		64		64
		user space	32		32		64
"generic 64bit"	kernel		64		64		64
		user space	64		64		64
("generic 64bit" is an architecture where everything, except maybe int,
is 64 bit. I think this roughly represents the Alpha.)
The only type which is at least sizeof(void *), and where kernel and
user space have the same size everywhere, seems to be  long long .
There are also a few typedef'ed types (e.g. loff_t), which have similar
properties.
My question is now if it's wise to use  long long  or some of its
equivalents all the time, or if we'd be better off just using a 64
bit type on architecturs where it may natively exist. (1)
My main concerns with using  long long  everywhere are:
 - can I expect the compilers on all platforms supported by Linux
   to do something reasonable when encountering  long long  ? (2)
 - in particular, can they do correct comparisons (for lookups)
   and simple math (for hashes) on  long long  ?
If  long long  isn't an option, is there any other "standard" type
that has the desired properties ?
(1) with the notable exception of sparc32, because user space can't
    easily tell sparc32 from sparc64, so it has to be  long long
    there too.
(2) For this discussion, we can assume the "standard" system
    development compiler, which should be some gcc/egcs variant.
BTW, the current solution is a typedef'ed type which is private to
the ATM code, and which is normally  long  but becomes  long long
on sparc32/sparc64. This will of course break as soon as the next
architecture comes along, where  sizeof(long) < sizeof(void *).
Thanks,
- Werner
