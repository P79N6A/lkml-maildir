Good day.
The bug where the kernel repetitively emits "atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on 
isa0060/serio0. Some program might be trying access hardware directly" 
(sic) on a panic, thereby scrolling away the information that would help 
in seeing what exactly the problem was (ie, "Unable to mount root fs" or 
something) is still present in 2.6.20-rc2.
Rene.
