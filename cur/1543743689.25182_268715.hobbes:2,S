we were discussing this exact thing recently.. we maybe able to clean this up.. here is why
we are doing this manual thingy...
When we support physical component hotplug, we want to create the sysfs entries, but that doesnt
mean the component (i.e CPU or memory) is hotplugged. The reason is for node level hotplug
there are sequencing requirements, memory needs to be brought up first before cpu, and also
the error handling/policy requirments which we want the user space to handle it and not from 
kernel side.
the sequence is when physical arrival of cpu is seen, we will just create a sysfs entry 
which will also send an add event (which really is just cpu arrival, and sysfs created). 
In our model the event is just consumed by the script cpu.agent, which would in turn decide and 
bring the cpu up by 
#echo 1> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/online
what apps really would care about is the ONLINE (which doesnt exist) event itself, and the 
OFFLINE. The ADD/REMOVE only indicate sysfs entries appear and disappear.
I dont know if adding ONLINE/OFFLINE is the right thing, or use the CHANGE notification 
to inform. 
This is an area that needs more though which is slightly different from how other devices are being handled.
Greg-kh/Rusty .. any suggestions
