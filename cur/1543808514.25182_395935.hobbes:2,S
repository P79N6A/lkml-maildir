True. But you should pretend to never have seen that.  This macro is low 
level stuff and if it changes for whatever reason it is better if driver 
code didn't reimplement it. Furthermore the argument to __REG() is 
always a constant not a variable making it a simple absolute address 
that the compiler can use and optimize for pretty effectively.

Actually, it will do almost the same as you originally did if you look 
at its definition.  However, because a solution needs to be implemented 
to support multiple ports then using __raw_readl() at the driver level 
is more familiar to other kernel people.

They are fine already.
In fact, if there was only one SSP port, I'd have asked you to use 
SSPCR0, SSPDR, etc. directly.  But the fact that the driver can handle 
multiple ports makes it rather messy (and the SSP*_P() macros in 
pxa-regs.h are an abomination IMHO).
