BTW, for your reading pleasure :)
#define atomic_set(v,i)		(((v)->counter) = (i))
(asm-i386/atomic.h)
And that's really far from beeing the 2 only cases where the kernel _relies_
on a write of a simple type like int or long to an aligned location to be
atomic. Almost all drivers manipulating DMA descriptors do that, jiffies
is a good example too afaik, and more and more and more ... so if the
compiler is breaking that up, I think the set_pte race is the least of
our problems :)
