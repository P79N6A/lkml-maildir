I suspect it was afterwards. All the reports about grub/mono/etc. not working
anymore etc. only appear now. It's possible that there wasn't
enough testing before or the testing happened with completely
different semantics (like Fedora on grub) 
Anyways, I don't care about the 32bit change much because nobody seems to 
test that one anyways. Basically all the NX capable machines
are 64bit capable and often run 64bit kernels, and even if people run
32bit kernels they tend to run non PAE kernels where the problem is hidden.
The main thing what annoys me is that the x86-64 32bit emulation
seems to effectively serve as a testing ground for 32bit changes now,
because the stuff is not tested on 32bit.
And it's already enough work to keep the 32bit emulation working,
without having to care about additional issues like this.

I don't think so, no.
Linus, can you please tell me what you prefer? If you think
it's better to only disable this on x86-64 I can change that too. 
But it would be probably the wrong thing to do, because
then the same issues will all reappear later.
