I don't know git, but it seems, at least if done for web only, this
shouldn't be so 'heavy'. It could be a 'simple' translation of commit
date by querying a small database with kernel versions & dates. And it
would suffice if it were shown on the commit page only. But, of course,
it's not urgent at all! (And alas I'm no webmaster, so I can miss
something.)

Great! I misunderstood the page message. Btw., I know it's not the kernel,
but IMHO there should be some place for it in the MAINTAINERS!
Thanks,
