I saw the patch... the problem is we cannot say "oh I ran this code path
with the patch and did not see anything, it is safe".  Can sleep != will
sleep, and thus we have code that 99% will not sleep but it may.
I suspect on my 1GB machine I rarely page fault on copy_*_user but that
does not mean it could not sleep.
If you find all the culprits and think you can safely remove the
release/reacquire routines from schedule, all the power to you.
