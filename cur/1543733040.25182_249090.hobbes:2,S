Having followed this discussion a bit without really understanding it, 
I'd like to make a commment.
I was over to the x.org site this morning, looking to see if I could 
dl the latest tag to see if it would speed up my Extacy(ATI radeon) 
9200SE w/128 MB of memory any.  Tuxracer is a 2 seconds per frame 
game now, and of course unplayable.  And requires a reboot to restore 
x when you *have* managed to quit it, quite a feat in itself 
considering the mouse updates are equally slow, and apparently being 
'smoothed', meaning multiple frame lags after the mouse has been 
stopped.
Unforch, it appears not to be available as a tarball, or group of 
tarballs stuffed in a "grab all these" directory.  While I probably 
wouldn't be anything but a src of distracting questions, I still 
wouldn't mind an opportunity to build and test (and report on the 
grins and scowls) this if it can be built in a sandbox, leaving the 
existing X.org-6.7 release intact for rescue recovery.  I have the 
disk space, and plenty of cpu cycles I can steal from setiathome, so 
thats not a major problem.
Is the present, developers only access intended, or am I a dummy that 
can't see a link if it bit me?
