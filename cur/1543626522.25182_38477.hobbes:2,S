Trivial change to modutils, keeping backwards compatibility, so
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL == EXPORT_SYMBOL_INTERNAL.
When the flamers and lawyers agree on what they really mean by
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL or its replacement and everybody agrees on what the
keyword should be, let me know and I will roll a new modutils.
Otherwise, leave me out of this flamewar.
