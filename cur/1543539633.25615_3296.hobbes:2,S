Hi,
	When booting a bzImage of linux-2.4.0-test4 on my system, the boot freezes at the message "Uncompressing Linux.... Ok, booting the kernel."  Control-Alt-Delete is not effective; I have to do a cold reboot.  My kernel configuration file is attached.  My system is an AMD-K6/2 500MHz w/ 64Mb RAM, running on a PC-Chips PC100 mobo with a SiS530 chipset.  I'll be happy to provide any additional information/run tests.

Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there
be one, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of
blindfolded fear.... Do not be frightened from this inquiry from any
fear of its consequences. If it ends in the belief that there is no
God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and
pleasantness you feel in its exercise...
