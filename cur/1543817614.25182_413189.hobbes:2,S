Maybe... but why not 128K ??
There is certainly room to increase NFSSVC_MAXBLKSIZE, but I feel that
it needs to be done together with a more detailed look at consequences
in the network layer, particularly TCP window sizes.  I wouldn't mind
making a CONFIG_ tunable without that detailed look, but making it a
fixed change I feel less comfortable about.
