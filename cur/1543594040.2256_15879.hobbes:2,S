Hi, this is the correct forum.  You can submit the patch here.  Merely
paste the patch output inline into your email, and make your subject
"[PATCH] 2.4.5 FastTrak RAID Whatever Fix" and explain in the email.
Note your code must become GPL licensed.
I would suggest making the patch against the latest kernel, 2.4.5 -- or
even better, 2.4.5-ac13 or 2.4.6-pre2.
I suggest reading linux/Documentation/SubmittingPatches for coding
standards, etc.
It is good to see manufactures supporting their products in Linux, thank
you!
