As far as I know, when burning an ISO image, the image has 2048 byte
sectors to which the CD writer adds error correction data so that the
individual sector becomes 2352 bytes. A raw data image includes 2352 byte
sectors. The obvious difference would be a higher data rate (2352/2048
or 1.15x more) from computer to writer.
