Let me go on record as violently disagreeing, here.
A bad error message is still something you can track down. Even if it's  
bad, you know that execution reaches the point where it gets printed, and  
you can backtrack from there.
No error message and you have not even that.
In fact, in my experience, about a third of all error reports are  
misleading anyway, even given the most careful messages, and there's  
nothing you can do about that.
