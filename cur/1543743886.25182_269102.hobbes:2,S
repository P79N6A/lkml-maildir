Another train of thought, and copying gregkh for inspiration.  Is there
any way to know which devices lie about their size, and fix that with
quirk code in the device discovery routines?  While I can fix
fs/partitions/efi.c to not to always do I/O to the end of the
purported size of the device, userspace and 'dd' can't.  If we could
quirk down the reported size for devices known to lie, then everything
which uses that value wouldn't have to have its own rules for such.
Thanks,
Matt
