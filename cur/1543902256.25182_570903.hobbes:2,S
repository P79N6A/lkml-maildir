At this point it looks like we have the following communication nessasary 
between the two kernels
1. the original kernel needs to create a map of what memory to backup
   this could be either a bitmap, or a series of address:blockcount pairs.
   in either case the result could be sizeable, so it's probably best to 
define a standard location to find the type and address of the data.
2. the new kernel needs to tell the old kernel which 'restart point' to 
use.
   this could be a simple jump table.
   the list that has been suggested so far is
     A. restore (the default)
     B. suspend-to-ram
     C. ACPI suspend-to-disk (S4 mode)
since both kernels have access to the other kernel's memory the data could 
be stored in either kernel's address space, but my initial thought is that 
it's cleaner to store this in the original kernel's space and have the 
second kernel find it there.
I don't have the knowledge to create either of these interfaces, let alone 
the pull to get them implmented in the kernel.
could I ask that one of you consider makeing a patch that implements at 
least #1 (the memory map)
it sounds as if these kexec-back patches plus makeing the memory map 
available would allow for a ACPI-free hibernate mode with no other 
modifications. I'd like to try experimenting with this, but without the 
memory map it sounds as if things will croak when I try to do this.
