There are multiple places like this that need either a
list_for_each_entry_reverse_safe or list_for_each_prev_safe, neither of
which exist.  I'll send a patch to add one.
I've just converted to a macro in ail2_empty() -- I'm not sure why I'd
left it out in that spot, maybe to be consistent with ail1_empty above.
Thanks,
