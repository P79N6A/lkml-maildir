        Yes, I am very interrested in this.  I have a Chicony KBP-8993
keyboard with 14 extra keys and 2 extra led's.  I have not succeeded in
getting the keys to work with Linux, they don't do anything, not even
generate an interrupt. Apparantly these extra keys need to be enabled
and I don't know how.  Understanding a dis-assembled windows VxD is not
easy...
If I can help to get something going, let me know....
