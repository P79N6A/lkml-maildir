It's not so clear whether this behavior is a bug.  Remember, autostop is 
different from autosuspend.  For instance, the root hub will never be in 
autostop mode during a system sleep (suspend to RAM or suspend to disk) -- 
hence autostop doesn't have to worry about waking up the system.

But the silicon or board-level implementation bug you mentioned wouldn't 
cause any of those tests to succeed, would it?  Hence it wouldn't prevent 
an unwanted root-hub suspend.
Or are you trying to say that the original device_may_wakeup() value would 
be 0 if the bug were detected?

No, you must have misread the code.  It retains the checks for active 
schedules or pending deletions.  There's no need to check for unsuspended 
enabled ports, since autostop kicks in only when no ports are enabled.

If you think autostop should also check for device_may_wakeup(), I'll make 
it do so.  Remember though that autostop is intended to work even when 
CONFIG_PM is off.
