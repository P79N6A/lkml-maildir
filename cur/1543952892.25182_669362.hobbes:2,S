Hello Folks,
I'm running 2.6.24.3 kernel with the 3ware 9650se 8port in raid10 with 256K
of stripesize.
The question is: why linux kernel (2.6.24 but it's the same in older
kernels) see only 128K as it's max_sectors_kb ?
It's limited by max_hw_segments_kb which i think should be 256 with a 256 k
stripe.
It seems hardcoded somewhere, altough in 3w-9xxx.c i can't find it.
I'm running firmware FE9X 3.08.02.007 and driver version  2.26.02.010
Can someone help me?
Thanks in advance,
