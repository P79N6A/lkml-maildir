I've been trying to get tar errors myself, while writing a 35gb
filesystem to a DLT7000.  I'm now running 2.4.21-pre5-ac1 and I
haven't seen any errors.  Yet.  I'm using the 6.2.8 version of the
driver as well.  The filesystem is just a copy of my home directory
and some MP3s and other random files and such.  Lots of text and jpegf
files, along with some other stuff. 
Maybe I need to try and generate 15-18 files 2gb+ each and dump them
to tape with tar and see how that's handled, and if we get erorrs.
Stephan, can you double check your version info as well?  And it would
be great to get some info on your 3ware setup as well, just so we can
work on narrowing down the issues.
Unfortunately, due to the way I have to setup things, the RAID array
and the tape drive are on the same channel, which slows down things
I'm sure.  
Here are some timings from dumping and verifying the data to tape:
  jfsnew:/# time tar -c-W -b 128 -f /dev/st0 /scratch
  tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
  408.840u 869.730s 4:03:02.80 8.7%       0+0k 0+0io 258pf+0w
  jfsnew:/# time tar -c-W -b 256 -f /dev/st0 /scratch
  tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
  443.210u 1104.930s 4:07:00.89 10.4%     0+0k 0+0io 264pf+0w
My filesystem is a as follows:
  jfsnew:/home# mdadm -D /dev/md1
