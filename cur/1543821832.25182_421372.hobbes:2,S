Thanks, I had missed that patch.
I still think the current printk_clock() approach is broken by
default on an unknown number of platforms.
Probably the best way to fix it would be to make it use jiffies
unless the platform registers a proper printk_clock() function.

Yes, on various OMAP boards when 32KHz timer is being used. The 32KHz
timer is not enabled until in timer_init().

Tony
