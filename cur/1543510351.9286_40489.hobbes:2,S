We are going dogslow and we could be fast while using 2.3.18ac8 for
testing. Is this smart? Such two liner change won't harm on the long run
as the auto-tuning hash feature is pending to be merged and it will kill
such #define line completly _careless_ about the value it had in the
ancient or recent past.
I am not proposing a cappy band aid that will make mess and it will be
hard to remove. I am _only_ tuning by hand the hash for the most machines
that are running 2.3.18ac8 _right_now_.
It's the _same_ like setting __SMP__ = 1 in the 2.1.x Makefile. An
embedded hardware developer would have set __SMP__ = 0 in the Makefile
before compiling the 2.1.100 binary image for his embedded hardware.
I sure _want_ the d/i cache hash autotuning merged and I appreciate your's
and Chuck's patches infact. But as right now the value is hardwired, it
should be set to a value that will make happy _most_ of testers until the
new autotuning feature will be merged. That's different than adding crap
to the kernel. See?
