Ahh, yes. It seems to just do a "get_hash_table()", and put that bh into
the queues. Bad.

If this fix makes the oops go away, then the proper fix for the problem is
not the #if 0, but do add something like
	bh->b_end_io = buffer_end_io_sync;
to just before the "add_stripe_bh(sh, bh, i, WRITE);"
We've already locked the thing, so that should be ok.
I wonder about that "md_test_and_set_bit(BH_Lock ...);" thing there,
though. If the buffer we find was dirty but already locked, we won't be
using that buffer at all (because the md_test_and_set_bit() will fail),
which probably means that the RAID5 checksum won't be right. Hmm..
Why is there an dirty aliased buffer head anyway? That sounds like a
recipe for disaster - maybe we should have synched all the stripe devices
before we set up the raid? Is that a raid5 rebuild issue? What's going on
here?
