Hi David
I've looked at pci_alloc_consistent and friends.
My gripe with it is that dma_mask is not really a
per device thing, ESS Solo1 for example can
address 32bits for playback, but only 24bits for
recording. So shouldn't it be a parameter to pci_alloc_consistent
instead of being an element of pci_dev?
I'm currently setting the value just prior to calling
pci_alloc_consistent.
Why not just setting the mask to 24bits? Since
playback is what most people care for, and having
separate masks for both directions (BMDMA controllers)
allows playback still to work on archs that cannot
have 24bit only memory (alpha was such a case until
at least one week ago...)
