Subject: [ANNOUNCE] GIT 1.4.3.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The latest maintenance release GIT 1.4.3.4 is available at the
usual places:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
  git-1.4.3.4.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.4.3.4.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  git-manpages-1.4.3.4.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.4.3.4-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
Among many minor fixes and documentation updates, this contains these
fixes:
 - revision traversal now treats --unpacked as commit filter,
   not traversal limiter.  If you have unpacked commits that are
   parents of packed ones which are in turn parents of commits
   that are unpacked, running rev-list starting at the latest
   unpacked commits used to _stop_ at the first packed commit
   and older unpacked commits were not shown.  With this update,
   the traversal does not stop at packed commits, and shows the
   older unpacked commits.  The updated semantics is easier to
   use with git-repack --unpacked.
 - In a repository configured for shared access, if the
   permission bits of existing directories are misconfigured
   (e.g. running repository commands as root by mistake), a
   codepath to create a new object failed with incorrect error
   message.  Fixed.
 - An earlier fix to cope with traditional-style patches that
   were generated with --unified=0 broke handling of creation
   and deletion diffs in git-apply.  Fixed.
