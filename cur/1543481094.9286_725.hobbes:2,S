I just purchased O'Reilly publishing's book Linux Device Drivers, and none
of the simple examples will work. They come back with an unresolved symbol
for printk.
Compile command is :
 cc -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -c hello.c -o hello.o
It compiles fine, but insmod and depmod both find the unresolved symbols. 
No examples show what I need to link with or define in order for it to
work. The book is only updated to kernel version 2.1.43.. 
Any suggestions?
