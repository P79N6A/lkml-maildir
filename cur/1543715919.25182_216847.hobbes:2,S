Btw, I found another possible reason for this behaviour, which would fit 
into the idle temp problem I am experiencing again with 2.6.6-rc2-mm1 
kernel (unless it seems I use Ross C1halt idle patch): Perhaps this 
kernel uses the disconnect feature less often, so the probality of 
lock-up goes down. That would explain my higher temps...
