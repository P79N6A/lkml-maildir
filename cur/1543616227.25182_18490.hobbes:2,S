Don't have a C99 spec, but here's what info gcc has to say about it:
[...description of "function names" extension as currently found in gcc...]
   Note that these semantics are deprecated, and that GCC 3.2 will
handle `__FUNCTION__' and `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__' the same way as
`__func__'.  `__func__' is defined by the ISO standard C99:
     The identifier `__func__' is implicitly declared by the translator
     as if, immediately following the opening brace of each function
     definition, the declaration
          static const char __func__[] = "function-name";
     appeared, where function-name is the name of the lexically-enclosing
     function.  This name is the unadorned name of the function.
