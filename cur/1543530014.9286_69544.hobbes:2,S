I had an odd thought...
What if the kernel reserved a "stash" of VM--to be made available only in
OOM situations.  When we run out of normal VM, the "stash" is activated as
we begin SIGTERM'ing.  Processes which can exit using relatively little
"extra" memory are then able to pull out, leaving more room for less
efficient processes to exit.
Or is this what the low water mark stuff does?
