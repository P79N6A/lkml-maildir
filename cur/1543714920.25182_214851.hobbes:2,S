Hi All,
  I am trying the following "lvcreate" command and  I am hit an error. I 
googled for this error, and I can see it being listed in lotz of places, 
but without any solution or workaround.
Configuration:
----------------------
    RH-Linux 2.4.26
    1GB memory.
But the same command works fine, if I have only 512 MB RAM. Any help is 
highly appreciated.
Thanks
Shesha
