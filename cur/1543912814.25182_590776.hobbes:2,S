Your BSD software appears to have a bug in it.  Your email's CC line was 
truncated at "netdev@vge", with the rest spilling into your email's 
subject line.
I'll wager this bug also triggered a buffer overflow on your side, 
leading to an unwanted public spew of anti-Linux conspiracy theories.
But don't worry, we find them entertaining nonetheless.
