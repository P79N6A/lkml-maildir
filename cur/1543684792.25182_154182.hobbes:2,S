Well, it is started automatically. Actually, the line "replaying
journal" appears with every boot and it also lasts a while, so I
suppose it is actually done. fsck and replaying works with all other
file systems, it only hangs with the root fs.
It must have to do with the kernel at least partially since everything
works fine with 2.4.x.
I would be happy to help with debugging, but I need some guidance
since I'm not familiar with the kernel internals.

3.6.6, the kernel Changes says that 3.6.3 is required at least, thus
it should be okay.
Thanks in advance and have a nice day!
