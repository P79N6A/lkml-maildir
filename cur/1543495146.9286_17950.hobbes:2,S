"Michael K. Johnson" <johnsonm@redhat.com> sez:
	".... please it's polite not to take
	 things over without making at least
	 some attempt to contact the original
	 author, EVEN IF YOU DON'T FEEL THAT
	 THEY ARE VERY ACTIVE. ... "
The thing between Andrea and Michael does bring out this question :
	Just what is "POLITE" and what is not?!
I am not siding with either Andrea or Michael on this matter, but my thinking is
that if someone wants to maintain something, someone at least _ought_ to be
active to do the job, or at least be known to still be _ALIVE_ and still willing
to carry on that function. Else he or she should reliquish their "maintainer"
status.
It is utmostly ridiculous to force people in doing a netwide trace for the
"ORIGINAL AUTHOR" for any given patch/util if the code hasn't been updated for
ages, and the so-called "maintainers" just aren't around anywhere.
So what should one do if one finds a bug or two in Linux util/patches?
	Should one look high and low for the [elusive] "maintainer"
	or should one just post out the bug-fixed patch?!
Should there be a centralized clearinghouse for all the maintainers, so to make
it easier for people to find the _UP-TO-DATE_ addresses of the maintainers?
	Note:	The _UP-TO-DATE_ addresses of the maintainers
			_is_ an important point because there exist
			several addresses of the "maintainers" which
			are no longer valid.
				*I am _not_ refering to Mr. Johnson, btw.
				 Michael's address _is_ valid.*
IMHO, it is too silly to insist that people must adhere to the "POLITE DOCTRINE"
if the maintainers did nothing to announce their presence.
To the maintainers:
	Please announce your presence, at least once-in-a-while,
	in appropriate fora.
	Please tell us which packages you are maintaining, and
	what you expect us to do when we change/fix the code
	of the packages you are maintaining.
Any comments?
Sincerely,
Pete
