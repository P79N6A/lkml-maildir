By "your way" you mean "the current way", right?  In which case, the future
option I described is OK, right?  Or am I still missing something?

I already did this a long time ago, and how the files are stored is completely
orthogonal.  I used the user level NFS server and you could do a 
	mount -o ro,rev=v.2.5.5 -tnfs /home/BK/repository/xxxx v2.5.5
and it worked just fine.  I personally hate this because there is no way that
I have ever seen to make filesystem semantics == SCM semantics.  It turns into
a hack for read/write.  If it made you happy to do this for read only, hey,
there's a nice newbie project.

Whoops, sorry, try it with -Ur, the -U says "user files only, skip the BK crud"
bk -Ur grep torvalds
