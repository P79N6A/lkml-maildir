We're having a similar problem here, but using samba as a server.
1 Linux box, running samba server for several dos boxen.  DOS boxen open
connection.  After a while, the connection goes "bad".  PID (on the server)
has changed.  DOS-side resetting fixes problem.
Note that grepping for "kill(" in the source turns up several hits.
Another problem we are seeing is that you can't kill a file on the server
side if it's been touched by the client.
