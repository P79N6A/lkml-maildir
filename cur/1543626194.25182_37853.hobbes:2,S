	It is possible that you are the one-in-a-million case that really needs 
this, but the vast majority of the time people ask for this, they don't 
really want it.
	Consider two very important points:
	First, by the time you get this information, it's obsolete. If more data 
becomes available in-between when you make this call and when you attempt to 
read, you'll take a double penalty. You'll need an extra 'read' later to get 
the rest and your next poll/select will break out immediately (which can be 
very expensive if you're dealing with a large number of fds).
	Second, this would double the number of system calls you need to read the 
data from the socket. There's almost no conceivable scenario in which it's 
worth the cost of doing this when you can either keep a buffer that's a bit 
too large around or copy it into a right-sized buffer and you can choose 
which option after you know how many bytes you got.
