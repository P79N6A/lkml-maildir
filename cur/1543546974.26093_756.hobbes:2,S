Unfortunately, you are incorrect.  DMR did receive a US Patent (Patent
#4135240) on the SUID bit.  There is at least on text on Unix security that
contains a copy of the patent in an appendix.
(see, among other sources, Peter Salus'
http://www.nluug.nl/events/sane98/aftermath/salus.html
)
You can view the actual patent in the IBM patent database, by the way:

Speaking of Salus, I believe it was Peter who coined "the difference between
theory and practice is always larger in practice."

Erm... That would be a nice way to bury one's mistake - patent it and
refuse to license ;-) Unfortunately, didn't happen...
