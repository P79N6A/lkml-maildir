Hi folks,
I make two kernel threads each with an endless loop. Base on my
understanding on timeslice, I thought scheduler will let another
thread to have CPU resource while one runs out its timeslice. However,
I observed only one kernel thread is running inside its endless loop.
Therefore, here is my question. Does timeslice have any effice on
kernel threads? and how?
Cheers,
