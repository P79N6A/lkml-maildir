I thought to another solution to that, i.e. use get_user_pages() and kmap() 
the resulting pages, like other kernel threads do when accessing userspace 
context.
However, by looking at the code (starting from aio_pread), maybe AIO reuses 
too much normal I/O code to do this.
Actually, the changes wouldn't maybe be so intrusive, they're limited to 
__generic_file_aio_read (conditionalize access_ok, and change the setup of 
read_descriptor_t) and file_read_actor, plus the write side, plus anything 
not using  pagecache - generic_file_aio_read.
Having a different actor for AIO would work. The real problem is adding a 
field to iovec to specify whether we're passing in a page array (given by 
get_user_pages) rather than a void __user *, or passing an iovec "wrapper" 
structure, which can carry either a normal iovec or the new kind of 
descriptor.
However, this does not sound like too much added complexity. Instead, allowing 
to move a kernel thread elsewhere on the host is a lot more difficult.
