Unfortunately not everything works.
E.g. I need to build usr/ with a different (newer) binutils, so when the build
fails on assembling usr/initramfs_data.o, I used to do the following, which no
longer works:
| tux$ PATH=/usr/bin/:$PATH make usr/
| make: `usr/' is up to date.
| tux$
I guess I need a catch-all .PHONY rule, but don't know how to implement it...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
