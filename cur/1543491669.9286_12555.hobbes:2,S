Any idea who/where that was ? 
I remember some speculation of a /proc/bios, is this what you're thinking
of ?  Did anything come of this ?

 What may be possible is to dig out the datasheets of the various EEPROMs,
and add detection/support for them. Some vendors have released encrypted
BIOSes which only their programmers will decode, but I've seen decoders
for quite a few of them (Some with source).
I've definatly seen an Ami BIOS decoder.
Is this a Vendor specific thing, or do all Ami BIOSes ship encrypted ?
