Subject: [PATCH] drivers/char/keyboard.c unsigned comparison
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

keycode is a checked for a value less than zero, but is defined as an unsigned int, and is only called in one place in the kernel, and passed a unsigned int, so this comparison is bogus.
Thanks to LinuxICC (
