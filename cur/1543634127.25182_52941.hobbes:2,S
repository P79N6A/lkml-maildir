Hi folks,
   Is lseek64(fd, (off64_t)0, SEEK_END) guaranteed to return the
number-of-bytes in a block device (bugs aside)?  Single-UNIX-spec says
yes.  So why do we need BLKGETSIZE64 ??  And why do so many of the
mkfs-like tools try to do a binary search to find the file size?

You are lost in a maze of BitKeeper repositories, all almost the same.
