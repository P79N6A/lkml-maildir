Yes, but the box is *completely* dead--no magic keys, no ping response, no
scrollback, no anything.
Here's an update.  One of the crashes yesterday actually put an Oops on the
screen.  Unfortunately, the console was already hosed, so I could only read
the top part of it:
kernel null dereference @ 0000001c
current -> tss.cr3 = 00101000,
	%cr3 = 00101000
*pde = 00000000
Oops:	0002
Cpu:	0
EIP:	0010:[<c0124e7a>]
EFLAGS:	00010246
c0124e7a, from System.map, appears to be c0124edc, which is find_buffer.
That could make sense, I guess, because the last message on the console
before that crash appears to be:
Attempt to refile free buffer
which is from fs/buffer.c....
Sorry I don't have a complete Oops that might actually let people do
something.  I'm leaving town tomorrow, but when I get back, if it's still
crashing, I'll hook up a printer to the serial console and see if that lets
me actually catch anything.
later,
chris
