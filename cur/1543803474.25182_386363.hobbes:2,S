What does this apply to ? Is it dependant on something else not
merged yet ? I get rejects when I apply it to 2.6.15-git10
I don't have time to fix it up by hand right now (I was going to set
a build going before I turned in for the night..)
I'll poke at it again tomorrow.
Another datapoint btw: I've another EM64T that works just fine.
The one that fails is the only one that isn't using onboard VGA,
this one has a PCIE Radeon.  Given it happens when X is starting up,
it could be that the X radeon driver does something special which
is why others aren't seeing this.
