Steven, 
For what I remember Stian oopses were happening in random places in the VM freeing 
routines. That makes me belive what he was seeing was some kind of hardware issue, 
because otherwise the oopses would be happening in the same place (in case it was 
a software bug). The codepaths which he saw trying to access invalid addresses are 
executed flawlessly by all 2.4.x mainline users. He was also seeing oopses with v2.6.
Assuming his HW is not faulty, I can think of some driver corrupting his memory. 
Do you have any traces of the oopses you are seeing?  
Stian, you told us switched servers now, I assume the problem is gone? 
Are you still running v2.4 on that server?
Thanks!
