Why is that case invalid?  I may have DRM=y so I get DRM on my
PCI graphichs card.  Then I might load an agp module in order
to use agp on *some other* agp card. 
I have no problem with DRM=y,AGP=m being invalid for the common
single-card setup, but there are multi-card setups too.  Not that
I need this special case personally - I have two cards but don't use 
modules.
