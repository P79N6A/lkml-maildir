Suspend is Shakespearean, "to sleep, perchance to dream." I don't know 
why people are still trying the fix suspend, it works perfectly on all 
my machines, I would like to see some work on wake-the-@-up at this point.
The sad part is that using apm and 2.4, all my laptops seem happy to 
sleep and wake when asked. One of the reasons I'm running 2.4 on the old 
ones, the new ones boot fast enought that I don't care.
