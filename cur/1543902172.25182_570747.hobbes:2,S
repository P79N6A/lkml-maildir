The console behavior stays exactly the same as the patch
changes tty_schedule_flip to use the 0 delay. The change
to tty_schedule_flip() to use 0 delay also is OK. I had
looked at this when James originally posted this patch and found:
I looked further back and in the 2.4 kernels this scheduling
was done with the timer task queue (process receive data on
next timer tick).
I guess the schedule_delayed_work() with a time delay of 1
was the best approximation of the previous behavior.
There is no logical reason to delay the first attempt at
processing receive data so schedule_delayed_work() in
tty_schedule_flip() should be changed to 0 (as was the
case for con_schedule_flip).
The schedule_delayed_work in flush_to_ldisc() will continue
to use a delay of 1 if the ldisc can't accept more data.
This allows the user app and ldisc to catch up.
Subsequent calls to tty_schedule_flip won't affect
this 'back off' delay because once the work is scheduled
(with a delay of 1) new scheduling calls are ignored for
the same work structure.
I've been testing the change to 0 in tty_schedule_flip()
under various loads and data rates with no ill effects.
