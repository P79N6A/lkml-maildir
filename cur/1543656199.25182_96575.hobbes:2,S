I'm not so sure.
To get the most benefit from two logical CPUs, don't I need the kernel to
operate as a 2-CPU SMP system?
Windows XP initializes the system as SMP with two CPUs; when I run an OpenMP
application under Windows, it reports two CPUs and a maximum of two threads.
Under Linux,
Linux SMP should initialize based on the number of logical CPUS, not the
physical number of ships; thus, I should be seeing two CPUs in
/proc/cpuinfo, not one.
