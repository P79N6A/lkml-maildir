 Yet again, I'm confused.  I thought you'd missed a word in what you
asked because the config for 2.6.24.4 doesn't show this.
ken@bluesbreaker ~ $zgrep GROUP /proc/config.gz 
# CONFIG_CGROUPS is not set
# CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED is not set
ken@bluesbreaker ~ $
 I _can_ see it in the 2.6.25 configs (except for rc1).  Will retry
rc8 with them both turned off.
