Now that all issues have been resolved and it has been tested, I feel 
that this patch is ready to be included in the official tree.  Thanks to 
Greg for pointing these issues out.  If one of you could please forward 
this to Linus, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Also could you please resend 
this with the patch inline because if I do netscape mail will remove all 
the tabs. :-)
Thanks,
Adam
