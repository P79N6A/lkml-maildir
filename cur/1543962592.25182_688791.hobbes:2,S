If it's in the kernel it will end in distribution kernels.
And people will then use it.
You might be right, they might not immediately use it in production. 
They might use the current version one year later in the then one year 
old kernel they will then be using. Or the one year old version plus 
some random set of vendor patches.

You want to put experimental code into stable kernels and then blame 
people using it that they shouldn't have used it?
