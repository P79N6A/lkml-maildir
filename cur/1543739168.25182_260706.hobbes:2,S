is that a solvable problem?
quoting some dragonfly thread (whose aim is to implement something which 
would solve that)
    [...] via VFS 'environments', causes any particular package to see only
    the dependancies that it depends on, and the proper version of said
    dependancies as well.  Multiple versions of third party apps that normally
    conflict with each other could be installed simultaniously.  The
    packaging-system-controlled VFS environment would also hide everything a
    package does not depend on, like other libraries in the system, in order
    to guarentee that the dependancies listed in the packaging system are in
    fact what the application depends on.  There's no point in having a
    packaging system that can't detect broken and incorrect dependancies or
    we wind up with the same mess that we have with ports.
