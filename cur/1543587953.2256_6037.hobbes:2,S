I don't know what you mean about policy but this reset "feature" is a shure way to get bad values. I have not seen one good reason to have a reset other than it easier to read and that is something that can be fixed in userspace.
Moreover, in a non-resettable-counter environment, any client of the counter can trivially achieve the effect of a reset by (locally) storing a snapshot and doing a subtract. Conversely, if the counter is truly reset, information is lost permanently.
