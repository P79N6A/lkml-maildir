af_unix (IE: CONFIG_UNIX) currently uses the symbol get_max_files.  It 
is the only module that uses that symbol, and that symbol probably should 
not be exported as it's kind of an internal API.  Therefore if we mandate 
that CONFIG_UNIX != m, then that symbol may be properly unexported and 
made private, because nothing modular would use it.  Does that clear 
things up?
