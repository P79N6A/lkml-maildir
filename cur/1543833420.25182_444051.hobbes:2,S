more tests with different kernels:
 * 2.6.8         (no cold, yes hot)
 * 2.6.12        (no cold, yes hot)
 * 2.6.13.5      (no cold, yes hot)
 * 2.6.14.4      (no cold, yes hot)
 * 2.6.14.7      (no cold, yes hot)
 * 2.6.15        (no cold, no hot)
 * 2.6.16        (no cold, no hot)
 * 2.6.18-rc1    (no cold, no hot)
where "no cold" means the card is not recognized at boot
and "yes hot" means the card is recognized if i remove/insert it
when the system is running.
I'll try to debug it more but i don't really know what to do.. anyone
can point me to the right direction?
Thanks
Luca
