Ehm, yes, I know. But I guess you don't use Glade, do you?
interface[.ch] are completely generated by Glade, all the
create_windowXXX() functions are dumped into these files
and created from scratch all the time you save/regenerate
the project's source. The project grew over time, it's
pretty large now.
