This is why tmpfs was written, but if you're using an SSD with large erase 
blocks, and want to avoid setting up a swap partition, you could put the 
filesystem on a loop device instead.  The sync calls would be absorbed as writes 
to the non-sync backing file.  It's slightly more complicated to set up, and 
slightly less flexible, but the next generation SSDs won't have problems with 
random write performance, so the convenience of implementing such an option 
would be rather short-lived.  It's not a fundamentally evil idea, but it just 
doesn't seem to be worth the effort, particularly to maintain it for the rest of 
eternity.
