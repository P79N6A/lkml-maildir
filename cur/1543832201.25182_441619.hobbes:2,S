Your patch increases the size of a key data structure -- task struct -- 
for all users on all platforms, even when there are _no_ users currently 
in the kernel.
It is thus wasted space, for all users on all platforms.
Linux development doesn't work like this.  We don't know the future, 
until it happens.
Thus, this patch is appropriate when there are real users in the kernel, 
and not before.
