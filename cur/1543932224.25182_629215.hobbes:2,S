You really need to grep the whole tree, never ever decrease the scope
of directories to search if you want to see if an interface is used.
It's used by some ipv6 address translation code as well as some
bits in SCTP:
include/net/addrconf.h:	eui[0] = (ipv4_is_zeronet(addr) || ipv4_is_private_10(addr) ||
net/sctp/protocol.c:	} else if (ipv4_is_private_10(addr->v4.sin_addr.s_addr) ||
So lazy...
