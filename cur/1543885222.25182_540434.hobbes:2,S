OK, moving the compatible structure declarations from the header
to the individual source files will fix all the header mess and
the odd compilation errors on i386 when using the compat.h header
inside of another header.
That declaration will need to be duplicated in each driver that
uses it (4 drivers in my case). In that sense (a structure declaration
used by multiple code modules) it does seem like an interface definition.
If that is what is needed, I will do it.
