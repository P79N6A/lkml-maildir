Yeah, libata did its own padding and needed to add draining.  Private
implementation was complex as hell and James suggested moving them to
block layer.  Are you suggesting moving them back to drivers?

So, if a driver has requested aligning and draining, the driver should
extend the sg entry before the last one by the alignment if draining was
used for the request and extent the last sg if the draining wasn't used.
 I'd rather just implement them in the drivers.
