Hello, kernel hackers
Last night(in my local time), I test 2.3.22 in my notebook. This is a
RedHat 6.0 with all necessary security fixes.
The first kernel I compile failed when apmd was run. Frozen like ice with
oops. see attachment .config.old
Then I compiled another kernel, with CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE unset. apmd was
run and screen is messed and reboot to lilo. See attachment .config. The
apm setting is the same as 2.2.12 in my notebook.
My 2.2.12 config looks like this and works fine
--snip--
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK is not set
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_MULTIPLE_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
--snip--
Then I disable apmd using chkconfig. And boot into 2.3.22 and oops (seems
to be) at pcmcia. 
chkconfig --del pcmcia and boot into 2.3.22, frozen at portmap, hard
lock, even caplock is useless.
chkconfig --del portmap and boot into 2.3.22, another thing oops but I
dunno what it is.
Any way, I could boot into 2.3.22 single mode and no oops.
It was too late and I go to bed.
If anyone knows or want to know the reason, feel free to ask me and
I can redo the test.
