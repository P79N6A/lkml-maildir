 But what to do when i convert then from unicode to 8-bit iocharset? This can lead to that several characters in Mac charset will be converted to the same character in Linux charset. This will lead to information loss and name will not be reverse-translatable.
 To describe the thing better: i have 8-bit Mac encoding and 8-bit target encoding (iocharset). I need to convert from (1) to (2) and be able to convert back. I tried to perform a one-way conversion like in other filesystems but this didn't work.
 Probably NLS tables can be used when iocharset is UTF8. If you wish i can try to implement it after some time.

 Many people say many software is not UTF8-ready yet. Anyway i had problems when tried to use it. Many russian ASCII documents use 8-bit encoding so i need to be able to deal with them. Many software assumes that 1 byte is 1 character.

 Ok. Sorry for violations.
