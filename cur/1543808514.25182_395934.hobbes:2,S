No. You're shifting the blame, and this won't work here. You claim b,t,l
were more stable than device node naming (which is untrue, as proven),
and if it isn't because the assumptions in libscg don't hold, it's
still someone else's fault. In doubt, everything that isn't Solaris or
SchilliX is badly designed, a bug, or whatever.
That's a pretty egocentric view.
