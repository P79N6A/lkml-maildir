As I reported when I tested this patch, it works, but I could see an 
abnormally high load averay while triggering the error message. anyway, it 
is better to have an high load averag three or four times higher than what 
you would expect then a crash/reboot. isn't it? :)

p.s.
will test the other definitive patch on montday on both 8 and 16 CPU 
system.
