Thanks for the reply.  I've tried both version 1.02b and v1.03.  v1.03
fails to properly detect my card, v1.02b looks like it's working great so
far.  Here's the messages from both at boot (using 2.2.12):

For some reason, also in 2.2.11 and above, I'm getting all these extra
via-rhine driver version messages after the card is detected.  I didn't
get these in 2.2.10.
