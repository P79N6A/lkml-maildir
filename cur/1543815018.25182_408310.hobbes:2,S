Not really, that was David :)
What started this thread was the fact that since 2.6.11 Linux
does not stretch ACKs anymore. RFC 2581 does mention that it might be OK to
stretch ACKs "after careful consideration", and we are seeing that it helps
IP over InfiniBand, so recent Linux kernels perform worse in that respect.
And since there does not seem to be a way to figure it out automagically when
doing this is a good idea, I proposed adding some kind of knob that will let the
user apply the consideration for us.
