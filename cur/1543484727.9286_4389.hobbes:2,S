Yes. I can understand that. But why number of inodes only grows up?!
Ain't when we need some memory we must shrink inode pool and give freed memory
to those who need it?
Here is the example: Let's imagine I ran inode hog and now I have
a lot of inodes in cache. After some time I run memory hog(s), and a lot
of inodes in cache is now unused. One can expect that memory form that pool
can be returned back to be used by programs and another part of kernel,
is not it? But I got this:
mordor:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
2058    1885    0       0       0       0       0
1885 inodes in freeable pool, but not freed. Is there reason for it?
And when we need more inodes, this number grows. For now it grows slowly,
but memory got eaten anyway => "NT syndrome", not as fast as with 2.2.[01],
but here it is.

For now we have quite opposite situation "Too many inodes, contact Linux" :-\
