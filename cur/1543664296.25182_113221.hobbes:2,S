I was thinking about this before I got up. If the code was a hybrid of
what we have now and my changes, there wouldn't need to be such a limit.
If I am thinking straight, the number of pages to be copied back using
suspend_asm.S will always be within this currently limit, because no
highmem pages will be needed during the suspend process, so they can all
be put in the second pageset. The only issue then is storage of the data
for those pageset 2 pages. We could just add another layer of
indirection(!), but that would result in quite inefficient memory usage
in the pagedir struct beyond the end of pageset 1. Still, the
alternative is more complicated code, and if you have that much memory
anyway... I'll put some more thought into this.

Mmm, but not all of us do. I'm using Evolution, Win4Lin...

All things are possible, but not everything is beneficial :> (Bible).
Actually, I'm not sure it's possible in this case. We can't restart
processes when most of their memory space, along with all of the page
cache and swap cache is still on disk and they think it's in RAM.
