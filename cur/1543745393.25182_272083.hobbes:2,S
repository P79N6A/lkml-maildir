No, we're not. This sounds like an excellent soloution. 
We'll resync all the patches with the latest snapshot and then re-submit
the lot.
Sorry about the tabs-to-spaces screwup. We forwarded the patches around
so many different people for comment before sending them to lkml that
somewhere along the line something bad happned.
