Thanks: I'd forgotten about this.  Even "big smp" machines often have
different memory latencies.
I need to allow archs to override the core allocation.

Yep, I imagine you'd explicitly call setup_per_cpu_areas() in
cpu_init.  (the later call will do nothing).

Yes.  In fact, you get a boot error not a link error in my
implementation.
My previous implementation used a linked-list of memory chunks, like
so:
	Core kernel percpu	First dynamic percpu     Second dynamic percpu
	+----+----+---...-+  -> +----+----+---...-+  -> +----+----+---...-+ ->
	 CPU0 CPU1 CPU2...
You can then use the same __per_cpu_offset[], as the spacing between
each cpu's variables in the dynamically allocated sections is the same
as in the core kernel.  You can __alloc_percpu any size up to the
initial inter-cpu spacing (which was equal to the initial amount of
static per-cpu data, or 4k, whatever is more).
But if the cpu's variables are not consecutive (ie your NUMA point),
this scheme breaks down: you'd need to allocate areas with the same
spacing between them, which won't happen.
So I think the current, simpler choice is preferable.

Yes, I spoke with Alan Modra about what he had to do on PPC64, and ran
screaming.  We can live with more constraints, in the kernel, I think,
especially when the result is so fast and simple.
Thanks,
Rusty.
