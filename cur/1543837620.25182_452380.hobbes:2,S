Mhmm, that would mean I'd had to split up the driver. That would mean
duplicate code to a certain degree and two separate mini drivers with
very connected features.

Hmm. As you might have noticed I already posted an updated driver a
few minutes ago which resides in drivers/misc. Is there any need to
move it once again?

Hmm. Better not. That "automatic brightness control" feature and its
behaviour are very specific to this laptop. I don't see any value in
abstracting that. That would be quite a lot of overdesigning in my
eyes. In fact the driver disables this feature on load by default,
assuming that it was probably loaded to do the control in
software.

My updated driver does this now. The attributes appear in
/sys/devices/platform/s270pf/.

Whoever works on that: please make sure to offer a generic EC access
function similar to my ec_transaction() patch! Thanks!
Is there any timeframe for this EC rework? Is there any chance to get
my patch merged in the meantime? (Hmm, I guess i am little unpatient...)

Oh, that's OK. I value a quick reply quite a lot. Thank you very much
for your quick review!
Thanks,
