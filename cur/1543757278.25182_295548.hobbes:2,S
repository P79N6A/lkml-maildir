I don't know, but if I keep on whacking 'v' in xawtv (Video (Capture) on/off),
I get this kind of crap sooner or later (and Oops a bit later).
Dec 25 16:27:37 safari kernel: bttv0: timeout: drop=18 irq=3151491/3151491, risc=0d85301c, bits: VSYNC HSYNC OFLOW
Dec 25 16:27:38 safari kernel: bttv0: reset, reinitialize
Dec 25 16:27:38 safari kernel: bttv0: PLL: 28636363 => 35468950 . ok
Dec 25 16:29:56 safari kernel: ReiserFS: warning: is_tree_node: node level 8 does not match to the expected one 1
Dec 25 16:29:56 safari kernel: ReiserFS: hda6: warning: vs-5150: search_by_key: invalid format found in block 1774456. Fsck?
so, can you reproduce the Oops without using bttv?
I believe there's unresolved memory corruption bug in bttv...
