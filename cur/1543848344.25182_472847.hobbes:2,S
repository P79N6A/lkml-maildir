That would probably mean that there is a need for single interface. Making 
all accelerometers
export to /sys/devices/platform/hdaps sounds wrong to me. It should be a 
neutral place then.
There aren't that many accelerometers right now as far as I could tell by 
googling.
There are hdaps, amc (something for MAC I think) and now mdps ;)
Only amc and mdps are 3D - hdaps is 2D, and also amc and mdps in theory 
support
a free-fall interrupt instead of polling - I just couldn't get the interrupt 
part to work yet.
I did make the interface as close as I could to hdaps - seem my later post 
with a new patch.
