I wish it would. Most of the research and stuff so far has either put
the file system into the disk firmware (upgrade hell). Having a disk
which talked entirely about
	read(handle,offset, length)
	write(handle, offset, length)
	alloc(handle, near_handle, length, otherhints...)
might well work out rather better. It also allows the disk to do fairly
major relayout of data as it learns usage.
