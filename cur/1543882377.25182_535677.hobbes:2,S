Well, I think that much of what Linus is saying indicates that he hasn't tried
to write any such thing himself. ;-)
Anyway, I'm tired of all this thing.  Really.  I've just been trying to make
things _work_ more-or-less reliably in a way that Pavel liked and I really
didn't know that much about the kernel when I started.  In fact, I started as a
user who needed certain functionality from the kernel and that was not there
at the time.  I've made some mistakes because of that (like the definitions of
the ioctl numbers in suspend.h - this was just a rookie mistake, and I'm
ashamed of it, but _nobody_ catched it, although I believe many people were
looking at the patch).
Now that I know much more than before, I can say I agree with Linus on his
opinion about the separation of s2ram form the snapshot/restore functionality
(I'll call it 'hibernation' for simplicity from now on).  It should be done,
because it would make things simpler and cleaner.  Still, it will be difficult
to do without screwing users en masse and that's my main concern here.
I don't agree that we don't need the tasks freezer for suspending and
hibernation.  We need it, because we need to be sure that the (other) tasks
will not get us in the way, and that also applies to kernel threads (and I
don't think the tasks freezer is 'screwing' them, BTW).
I agree that the userland interface for swsusp is not very nice and I'm going
to do my best to clean that up.  I hope that someone will help me, but if not,
then that's fine.  OTOH, it's difficult, if not impossible, to do a
userland-driven hibernation in a completely clean way.  I've tried that and I'm
not exactly satisfied with the result, although it works and some distros use
it.  I wouldn't have done it again, but then I'm going to support the existing
users, as I promised.
Now, I think that the hibernation should better be done completely in the
kernel, because that's just conceptually simpler, although some data exchange
with the user land may be acceptable for some optional fancy stuff.  I'm also
tierd of the endless "to merge or not to merge suspend2" discussions that just
lead to nowhere.  For these reasons I declare that I'm ready to cooperate with
Nigel on integrating as much of suspend2 as reasonably possible into the
existing infrastructure, under the following conditions:
- we don't remove the existing user-visible interfaces
- we work on one piece of code at a time
- we avoid code duplication, as much as possible
- we avoid using open-coded things, if possible
- if we don't agree on something, we ask someone wiser (volunteers welcome ;-))
If that's acceptable, we can start tomorrow.  In the process, we can try to
separate the hibernation code paths from the s2ram ones, but that will require
a lot of knowledge about things that neither me nor Nigel, AFAICT, are very
familiar with, like writing device drivers.
Greetings,
Rafael
