Thanks for the CC.  I've been looking into this problem.  I am not too
sure why we require protection from concurrency via preemption and not
via SMP.  In other words, why are we SMP-safe but not preempt-safe here.
I don't really have an answer.
The problem I saw on boot was the BUG being triggered on the last line.
If we are able to preempt here and cause some problem, what proof is
there that we don't have a race wrt SMP?
