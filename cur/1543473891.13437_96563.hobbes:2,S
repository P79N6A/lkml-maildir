With the latest patch, it seems that I have killed the unnecessary swapout
without losing performance... I' ll continue some test today though...

Hi,
Much better.  This performance of this patch in the '117 image' test is
as good as the other (119 sec).  Perhaps even slightly better the second
time I ran it.  The 'tar /root/linux-2.1.132.tar' test shows that this
patch eliminates the anoying swap activity during io bound tasks.  I'll
try priority = 9 and see how it does.
Feel free to forward or use any of these test results however you see
fit.
Thanks,
Steve
