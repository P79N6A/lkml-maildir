Hi Alan
Here's a little more on the problem.
I've restarted my system, and I could mount the CD fine - modprobe efs, and
the kernel recognises the filesystem without a helping hand.  I noticed I was
using ide-scsi.o for writing last night, so I modprobe'd in scsi_mod,
sr_mod, cdrom and ide-scsi, mounted the CD, and instant problem.
The problem isn't the freshly burnt CD, as I tried with the original SGI CD,
which shows the same problem using ide-scsi, but is fine when I access things
natively over IDE.
Hope the extra detail is of use.
Best wishes,
Peter.
