There are devices which lock up hard if PHY enters PS mode (only
physical power removal can reset it) and I wouldn't be surprised if some
devices aren't happy with PS being too aggressive.  Well, I actually
expect to see such devices.  It's ATA after all.  This is unknown
territory and that's why I was using 'seems ... to me'.

I don't think the end result will vary in any significant way.  My
biggest argument for sw implementation is it can be used for other
controllers.

Currently, ahci is the only one which has controller-side automatic PS
but some ATA devices (hdds) implement device initiated PS (DIPS).  The
sw implementation supports SW HIPS and DIPS.  We can add HW HIPS support
and hook ALPE/ASP support there but I don't think it would have benefits
over SW implementation.
I think it's a bit different from cpufreq.  ATA is cheaper and more
broken and much more diverse.
Thanks.
