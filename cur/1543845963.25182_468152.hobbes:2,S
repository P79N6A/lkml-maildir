Is this also needed if you use "platform" method? Also with suspend-to-RAM?

Although it generally is a good idea to add suspend and resume methods to
all ACPI drivers, it would be interesting to know if you still need this
when using the correct method (platform) instead of the incorrect default
method (shutdown).

echo "disk" > /sys/power/state
