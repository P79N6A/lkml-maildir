I'm not sure. Suspending the chip means you lose things like link beat 
detection, so it's not something you necessarily want to automatically 
tie to something like interface status. Some chips support more 
fine-grained power management, so we could do something more sensible in 
that case - but right now, there doesn't seem to be a lot of driver 
support for it.
