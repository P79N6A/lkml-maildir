Good day!
Sorry for intruding, but I'm seeing the same problem on my U10 with 
2.6.22-rc3 and Xorg-7.1+gentoo patches.

Xorg-7.2 (to be more precise, xorg-server-1.2.0) never worked for me, you 
can see my bug on gentoo bugzilla for more info:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167052
But Xorg-7.1 worked fine on kernels up and including 2.6.21

I sent David privately my .configs , Xorg.0.logs and strace logs for 2.6.21 
and 2.6.22-rc3. Hope it helps.
