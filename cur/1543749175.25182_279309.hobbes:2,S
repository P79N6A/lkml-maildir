[snipped Java efficiency questions]
Overall, the Linux kernel is sufficiently fast and good at scheduling 
IO that
unless you're using well optimized C or assembly, you'll never be able 
to get
better IO results than by just letting the kernel manage it for you.  
Java has
sufficiently many extra layers of indirection that any slowdowns due to 
the
fact that Java is a heavily interpreted language are orders of magnitude
bigger  than any slowdowns from improper IO scheduling.
