I want to do some bio IO on a block device (*no* filesystem involved).
First I need to get hold of the struct block_device. What is the current
recommended way to get from the name of a device (e.g. "/dev/sda1") to the
corresponding struct block_device ? What is the current canonical representation
of a device - dev_t ? Did kdev_t go away ?
Given the struct block_device, can I immediately use it in a bio, or do I need
to prepare the device first ?
I think I understand how to submit a bio, once I have the block_device ready.
I have read that the handling of block_devices is not as straightforward as it
could be... (

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Again, please CC: me on any replies.
