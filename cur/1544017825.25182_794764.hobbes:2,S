Should be Anatolij. ;-)
But I'm interested in this driver as well.
FWIW, the patch looks OK, except for the long lines in the commit log.
Also you'd better mention exact build error in the commit log.
Reviewed-by: Anton Vorontsov <avorontsov@ru.mvista.com>
(Btw, we'd better fix the build for sparc instead of adding another
"depends on". Could anybody point to some recent, working sparc cross
toolchain? Last time I googled for it I found only some prehistoric
versions that I didn't bother to try...)
