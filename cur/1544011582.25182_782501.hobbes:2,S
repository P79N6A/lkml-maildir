Subject: [PATCH 0/2 v5] SGI RTC: add clocksource/clockevent driver and generic timer vector

The following patches provide a driver for synchronized RTC clocksource and
clockevents for SGI systems, as well as a generic timer system interrupt.
With these patches, a module can be installed that registers the system-wide
synchronized RTC clocksource and timers as both a clocksource and clockevents
device running in high resolution mode.
