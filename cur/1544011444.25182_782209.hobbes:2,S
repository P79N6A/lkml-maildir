Liam, the pcf50633-regulator.c has depends on
include/linux/mfd/pcf50633/core.patch which is not here, but in
[PATCH 1/7] of the series. So, pcf50633-regulator.c it wouldn't
build.
I was expecting it to make it to -next via linux-mfd - I've asked
Samuel Ortiz about this in [0/7].
So, I was hoping you to ack this so that Samuel can take it into
linux-mfd.
I apologize for the confusion.
