I cant reprpoduce it at will, thats the thing. It likely happens with NFS
mounts. agruen@suse.de did some work recently. But I remember even with
these changes (for a 2.6.13), the busy inodes did not disappear.
Merging your patch into our cvs will give it more testing, I will do
that tomorrow if noone disagrees.
