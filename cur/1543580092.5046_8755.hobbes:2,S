In reading the PIRQ specs, and making it work for our board, I thought
about this.  PIRQ states that link is chipset-dependant.  No chipset that I
have seen specifies what link should be.  So, as this case demonstrates, it
may be 'A' - the value the chipset expects, or 1, the logical index.
Either one makes sense, assuming the PIRQ routing code knows what link
means.  Here we see two BIOS vendors/versions that apparently do it
differently for the same chipset.    Grrr.
