You've probably gotten a dozen responses in private, but in case you
haven't; Go buy Rubini's book "Linux Device Drivers" (O'Reilly &
Associates, Inc.)  An updated version is in the works, but the version
that is out will explain much more than just bottom halves.  Anyone
recommend other good resources on this?
