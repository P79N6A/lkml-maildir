OK, obviously I am still missing something here from when I got the
driver booting again.  Presumably something with current_nr_sectors,
vs nr_sectors, maybe?  I thought it was odd that all the transfers were
exactly 2 blocks. I'll go ahead and take this one.  I will also go ahead
and check to see how much data the hardware can transfer at once
as well, but I expect it is quite a bit.  I am still working on getting a
group of folks to test patch #5 to see if it works as well.  Anyone
with appropriate hardware willing to test can contact me.  All I have
access to is my thinkpad 700 PS/2, and a 50Z that is a 286.
Thanks,
