There is a specific reason that the numbers are _kernel_internal_!!!   
I set up
my udev so that my green CD burner is /dev/green_burner, and my blue  
CD burner
is /dev/blue_burner.  Please tell me again why exactly I can't just  
give the
option -dev=/dev/green_burner and have it use my green CD burner?   
That's a lot
easier than messing with random groups of 3 numbers and trying to  
remember in
which order I plugged in my burners, and which kernel I'm running, so  
I can
remember the enumeration order, etc.

The information is obscured because userspace shouldn't know or care

What exactly is false about the claim?

I burn CDs fine all the time as a user, and I _don't_ need to lock  
memory or
raise priority, because I have a good scheduler, plenty of RAM, and  
dual CPUs.
It would be nice if you could let me leave on the _hardware_ BurnProof
technology designed to prevent that sort of thing, but it doesn't  
appear to
fit with your ideals of 100% perfect CDs, does it?  Besides, by the  
time we
hit the point where BurnProof would turn on, the disk is either  
completely
dead and useless (no burnproof), or slightly scarred and still  
useable (with
burnproof).  Personally, I'd rather have the latter.

Did you try submitting a list of important SCSI commands and their  
functions?
I suspect that if you provide a clear, concise list of harmless  
commands,
they would be included in the available command set.

Uhh, but I don't run cdrecord as root.  My /dev/green_burner device  
is owned
by root, has group "media", and perms rw-rw-r--.  Since this is a  
somewhat public
machine with lots of users in the "media" group, I don't want anybody  
to be able
to turn my drives into bricks.

Why can't you just provide an option to leave it on?  My Mac and Windows
computers seem to do just fine with it.  In fact, all modern CD-ROM  
drives
were designed to be able to read such "degraded" media, even "degraded"
media that also has scratches and dents and dings and scars and all  
sorts
of other glitches in the CD surface.
