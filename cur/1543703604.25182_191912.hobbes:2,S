Ever since i upgraded to 2.6 my NFS performance has dropped.
I have a OpenBSD Server running nfsd. The other boxes on my lan
running windows and or the 2.4.x kernel have no performance problems.
Files transfer at normal speeds for a 100mbit connection. My main workstation
which is running 2.6.1-mm4 (i have also had 2.6.1 and 2.6.0 on it) has 
almost zero nfs performance. I get at the most 500K/s. Anyone have ideas?
I upgraded to -mm4 having seen some NFS fixes in the patch but none of them
seem to have applied to my situation. Thanks in advance.
