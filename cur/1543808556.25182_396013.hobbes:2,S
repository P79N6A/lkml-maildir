Where is my mind..?
Sure, why not. Guess I had my head too much in the smoke clouds of not
knowing why a dead-sure-to-work implementation still would not do the
right thing, I already thought I got the C representation of true and
false wrong. Even Tony's hint would be clearer than my code, but that
can in turn be condensed into something really obvious. It's just a
negation, after all. Silly me.
Changed patch below. Should be the final one now, right?
