Its not GPL compatibly licensed.

We don't want adapter teaming and fault tolerance in adapters. Thats the kind
of proprietary single vendor crap windows people suffer. You want to be able
to team and fail over mix vendor cards.
At most it will be useful for documenting how you access the rest of the
features on the management adapter which we dont currently handle.
I wish I knew why vendors were intent on duplicating working drivers.
