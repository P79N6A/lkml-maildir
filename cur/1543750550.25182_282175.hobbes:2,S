I've had this in my voyager tree for a while ... it contains two bug
fixes (double #include and a missing iounmap) and also the reboot rework
which affects VISWS as well.
The patch is available here:
bk://linux-voyager.bkbits.net/voyager-2.6
The short changelog is:
Adrian Bunk:
  o i386: reboot.c cleanups
  o i386 voyager_smp.c: remove a duplicate #include
James Bottomley:
  o dma_release_declared_memory needs iounmap
And the diffstat is:
 kernel/pci-dma.c             |    1 +
 kernel/reboot.c              |    2 +-
 mach-visws/reboot.c          |    3 ---
 mach-voyager/voyager_basic.c |    2 --
