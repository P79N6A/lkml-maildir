Why a mount option at all?
Why not just a switch for the mount utility?

I think it is acceptable to change this behaviour in a new version of
the mount utility. One could considder ignoring the restriction when
running with "-a" or when running as root - that would reduce or
eliminate the problems with the transition.
However, if this is implemented in mount itself, it is totally
orthogonal to the FUSE merge discussion.
