Changing the parameter name will break the configuration of anyone who was
using the existing parameter.  It also means everyone who has multiple
kernels installed and uses this parameter will need to have one
configuration for old kernels and a different configuration for new
kernels.
In the default really needs to be changed (what's so hard about setting
alloc_bufs_at_load in /etc/modprobe{.d,.config}?) then just change the
default of the existing parameter.  That avoids the whole problem with
different configration files for different module versions.
