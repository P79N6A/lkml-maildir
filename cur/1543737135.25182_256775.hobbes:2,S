Aha ... you finally got through my thick skull.  Congratulations ;).
If file "foo" goes away, and if the kernel only reports that inode
314159 was unlinked from a given directory, unless some user code
previously remembered that inode 314159 was accessible from the
directory entry named "foo", you can't tell the user that "foo"
disappeared.
Do you have the same problem with directories, if some cookie, not the
full pathname, is passed back after an 'rmdir(2)' event?  Or is it just
that it's less onerous to track all the directories, because there's
fewer of them?

That was the idea, yes.  Most of it anyway.  That and striving to keep
the API the kernel presents to the user minimal and orthogonal.

If there is a way, any way, for user code to get something from the
kernel, then I don't mind dragging my feet on providing other ways,
until I see a good reason.  It's always worth a bit of effort to keep
kernel API's minimal and orthogonal.
Your "delete and rename" point above seems now like a good reason.

No comment ;).
