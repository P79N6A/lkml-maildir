Then we have to agree to disagree.  Signed/unsigned mixups are just too
easy to get wrong in C, and a constant source of security bugs.

It is out of the x[1] array, *if* you consider it an object of its own
(whether this is the right viewpoint is the point of the issue).

I'd guess that the language experts on comp.std.c are more clueful about
the C standard than both you and me.
