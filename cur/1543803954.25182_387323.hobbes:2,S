The list is filtered due to my minimal resources and inability to have any 
formal spam filtering so only members or approved emails get through and 
everything else silently dropped. Sorry about any inconvenience. I've added

These errors do not occur with the full patch. Are you using any split patches 
or just the full patch? Separating out patches is not a trivial thing to do.
