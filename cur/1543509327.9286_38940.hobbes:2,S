I agree. I don't like the idea of adding kludges to the MTRR code. It
should provide a minimal interface, making no assumptions about PCI
regions or anything like that.
That said, if a more convenient facility would be generally useful
(not just in vesafb), then that could be added somewhere else, and
vesafb and similar drivers could make use of it. It probably makes
sense to put such a facility in the x86-specific PCI support code,
since we are assuming PCI region rules.
