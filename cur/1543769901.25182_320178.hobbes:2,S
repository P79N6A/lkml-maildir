I found several systems in which the host bridge was decoding 6+
resource ranges. In the pci_bus structure, I only have room for 4,
so I'm forced to drop some ranges that are in fact being passed
down. For such cases, if I enable this by default, I see boot time
failures for devices that attempted to claim these dropped resources.
These devices were otherwise properly configured by BIOS, and work
fine with today's (incorrect) assumption that all host bridges
decode all unclaimed resources. I didn't want the patch to break
existing systems, hence the boot parameter.
Another option I'd thought of but never really pursued was to
implement this as a late_initcall. I'll look into that some more.
In that case, we'd continue to think that all host bridges decode
all unclaimed resources at boot time and depend on BIOS to program
resources for boot time devices correctly. Later, we'd collect the
more accurate host bridge resource picture to make hotplug work
correctly. Kind of hackish, but I can't think of another way to
avoid the boot parameter.
