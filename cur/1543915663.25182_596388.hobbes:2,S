I don't know the detailed history, but my understanding is that
for some of these, mainline attempts were made in the past.
The patchkit gives a place for things to live while they are out
of mainline, and still have multiple people use and work on them.
Optimally the duration of being out-of-mainline would be short, but
my experience is that sometimes what an embedded developer considers
reasonable to hack off the kernel is not considered so reasonable by
other developers (even with config options).  Also, sometimes it
takes a while for a patch to mature to the point where it is
acceptable for general use, while still being usable for
special-purpose projects.
