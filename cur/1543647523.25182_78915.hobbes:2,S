Sorry, I wasn't specific enough.  What is the clock speed (MHz) of the
CPU and the RPM and/or results of hparm -t of the hard drive?

How fast?  If you have, for example, the 2.4.18 tree and apply the
2.4.19 patches, approximately how long does it take for citool to show
up, showing all modified files (less than a second? 10 seconds? a
minute?)
