I had a system once that looked very much like it had bad ram, but it turned 
out to have a bad hard drive controller, which showed up paging stuff into 
memory from disk (ala exec, sometimes), and in bringing stuff back in from 
swap.  (The kernel almost never went bye-bye, because it never swapped out, 
you see...)
Caused the weirdest problems in Myth II, among other things...

Check the raid controller.  Especially if you're swapping through the raid 
controller.  I found out what was wrong with the other system by copying big 
tarballs through the network and verifying them.
Try this:
1) Copy a tarball to the remote system and confirm that it came out OK just 
coming across the network.
  cat enormous.tgz | ssh othersystem "tar tvz"
2) Now copy the tarball to the remote machine's disk, and test that the copy 
on disk is good.
  cat enormous.tgz | ssh othersystem "cat > temp.tgz; tar tvzf temp.tgz"
Of course using a tarball that's bigger than your ram, so it actually does 
have to write it out to disk and read it back in again.  Using ssh provides a 
little bit of a CPU load, and of course the network is providing a competing 
source of interrupts.  (You could also run contest in the background or some 
such to really beat the system to death...)
