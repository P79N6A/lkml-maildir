I've fallen a little behind in the documentation. I wanted to see what got 
pulled in before updating ftrace.txt. But you are correct, I probably 
should add the documentation updates along with the patches.
But unfortunately, I'm a bit lazy. I like to wait and see what makes it to 
mainline, and then write a patch to update ftrace.txt to reflect that. It 
lets me do it in one sitting, instead of doing it for each change.
Honestly, I think I document it better that way. If I document right after 
writing the code, I do it with too much knowledge of the code, and my 
writing is confusing for others. If I wait to document, I forget what I 
did, and have to relearn what I wrote, and then I have a better 
perspective of what others will want to know.
Thanks,
