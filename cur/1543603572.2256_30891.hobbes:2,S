The alternative (NAPI) only works with Tulip and Intel NICs, it seems.
When the alternative works for every driver known (including 3rd party
ones, like the e100), then it will truly be an alternative.  Untill
then, it will be a great feature for those who can use it, and the
rest of the poor folks will need a big generic hammer.
