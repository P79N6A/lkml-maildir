I didn't switch to sysvsems because I was worried about them not working
in older kernels... whereas we've been using fcntl() for a long time. 
I actually did some (crude) timings before apache 1.3.x on linux 2.0.35 --
fcntl() versus flock() versus sysvsem().  I found flock() was the fastest,
by some small amount.  I bit the bullet and switched to using flock(),
because I figured mail clients had it tested well.  But then a few random
bug reports came in which were solved by the user switching back to
fcntl(), so for 1.3.6 I switched linux back to fcntl().  (Interested folks
can visit bugs.apache.org, search for flock.) 
SysVSem on other platforms have some annoying limitations, such as a small
max# of folks that can attach to a semaphore.  Plus sysvsems aren't
cleaned up on process exit... whereas a fcntl()-locked file can be
unlink()ed as long as everyone already has the fd.
In theory you can edit src/include/ap_config.h, search for LINUX, and
change the USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT to USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT
... rebuild, and try again. 
Ah, you might want this patch, the sysvsem code isn't as well tested as
the other code.
