Possibly hiding in the patchset someplace where I don't see it, but IBM's
VM hypervisor supported reflecting page faults back to a multitasking guest,
giving a signal that the guest supervisor could use.  The guest would then
look up which process owned that virtual page, and could elect to flag that
process as in page-wait and schedule another process to run while the hypervisor
was doing the I/O to bring the page in.  The guest would then get another
interrupt when the page became available, which it could use to flag the
suspended process as eligible for scheduling again.
Not sure how that would fit into all this though - it looks like the
"discard fault" does something similar, but only for pages marked volatile.
Would it be useful/helpful to also deliver a similar signal for stable pages?
