No, it might be, actually.  If you skip acpi_enter_sleep_state(), your machine
doesn't really suspend, so in fact you only confirm that your drivers implement
.suspend() and .resume() hooks correctly.
First, you can check if the patch
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.22-rc3/patches/20-ACPI-preserve-the-ebx-value-in-acpi_copy_wakeup_routine.patch
helps, by chance.
Second, you can use PM_TRACE (Documentation/power/s2ram.txt) to find the
place where it really fails.
Also, please read Documentation/power/basic-pm-debugging.txt .
Greetings,
Rafael
