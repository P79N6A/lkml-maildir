Yes, as part of the cleanups which accompanied the new 'make
headers_install' target for creating sanitised kernel headers, all of
the _syscallX() stuff was removed from user visibility.
Unfortunately, Linus subsequently applied a patch which was sent to him
privately without review on the mailing list, which reverted that fixup
and made _syscallX() visible in userspace again on a couple of
architectures. That regressions should hopefully be fixed again before
2.6.18 is finally released though -- and in fact we're probably going to
kill off _all_ use of _syscallX(), even in the kernel, before 2.6.19.
