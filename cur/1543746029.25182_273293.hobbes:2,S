Yes, I'd like to get rid of "too many continuous pages" problem
before. Small problem is that it needs to update x86-64 too, but I
guess that's okay. I'd like that version to go in *before* that
page-cache stuff (it actually fails a lot in wild).
Could you possibly put page-cache stuff into separate file? It would
be even nicer to have it configurable (run-time or compile-time) so
that if swsusp fails, I can tell people "try again with page-cache
stuff turned off"...
