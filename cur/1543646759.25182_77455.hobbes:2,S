NFSv4 does not specify that files need to be backed by local storage
the way AFS does if that is what you mean. However it does offer
AFS-like features (such as file delegation / leases) that make a
cachefs a much more feasible proposition.
I, for one, would be very interested in seeing a cachefs add-on for
NFSv4. I think that it would be of great use for GRID / distributed
computation applications, which is where my personal interest in NFSv4
lies.
Cheers,
