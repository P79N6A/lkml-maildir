hi
i am working on writing a serial - tty driver for a custom board
the uart in implemented in a fpga and has two very simple fifo's for rx/tx
and few bit on status of the fifo, masks for the interrupts. it is a
simple fixed baud rate bit blaster with three wire interface, i was looking
to see if there is an existing driver that i can use/modify, or example
driver to write a new one if need be.
any help is greatly appreciated
TIA
niraj gupta
