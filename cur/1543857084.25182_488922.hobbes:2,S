Doing a check at boot time is fine for me. Just I don't want the
"read pmtmr three times at runtime" code anywhere near x86-64
I don't think the boot time check needs DMI guarding
But BTW the check is not necessarily enough -- there is at least one
NF3 machine around where the PIT timer ticks at a wrong frequency.
Safer would be probably to calibrate against RTC which is afaik used
by Windows too (so it's likely to be ok)
