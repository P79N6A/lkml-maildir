Hi folks,
Well, I can say the mood here at supercomputing'07 is pretty somber  
in regards to the latest exchange of messages regarding the perfmon  
patches. Our community has been the largest user of both the PerfCtr  
and the Perfmon patches, the former being regularly installed by  
vendors and integrators on clusters at install time, and the latter  
now being adopted into vendor kernels by IBM, Cray, AMD, SiCortex and  
others. Of course, adoption by a vendor, does not a good kernel patch  
make. However, it should be viewed as a strong data point on demand  
for such functionality. We are a community focused on performance and  
we have long had a need for these tools.
A solution that does not provide 64 bit virtualized per-thread counts  
is not a solution at all. That would need to be ripped out by all of  
us using this functionality so we could get something that actually  
does what the community needs, not what the you folks think we need.  
Device level access and/or root access to the counters is not  
unacceptable for machines in production. If that was fine, oprofile  
would have satisfied everyone and we wouldn't be sucking up your  
bandwidth. Please understand that people outside of the your  
community are desperate for adoption of any form of 'per-thread' PMU  
functionality into the kernel. For those of you who are (still) not  
convinced of this, I can arrange your inbox to be spammed by 1000's  
of HPC geeks, managers, vendors, etc. My point is, let's start  
somewhere that the community finds useful. Otherwise we run the risk  
of developing an interface that everyone isn't comfortable with and  
no-one uses. Hardly a productive exercise.
So please, do consider a set of core functionality that provides for  
(at least) the following:
- per-CPU and per-thread 64 bit virtualized counts
- third person operation (attach/ptrace)
- dispatch of signal upon interrupt on overflow if requested
- 'buffered' interrupts into a buffer that can be mmap'd into user space
- support for a variety of the major processor platforms
Regards,
