Its luck on your part then. There is no provision in the system for handling
that race using interruptible_sleep_on, because you can construct multiple
correct solutions without having to hack the kernel up
Hints
1.	allocate a semaphore on the stack
	set up for irq
	do hardware stuff
	down_interruptible(&sem)
	if(interrupted by signal)
	{
		job->sem=NULL;
		clean up completely (including stopping an irq hitting sem)
		return failed)
	}
	Ok
	In the irq do an if(job->sem) up(job->sem);
The semaphores are counting so do the right thing if there is an ordering
race.
2. 	Use add/remove wait queue so that the race leaves the task woken 
	if it beats the sleep begin
3.	Use cli to lock around the contentious areas (ugly)
