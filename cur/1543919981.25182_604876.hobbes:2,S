Hi everybody,
I know it is a bit off-topic, but I am doing a research at uni
about online communities (like the Linux community itself),
and I need primary data, so if some of you would kind enough
to donate his time and take my survey at:
http://q.sierraforce.com/
Would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you all,
keep up the good work
Cheers
