Agreed - I spent a couple of hours today learning why it

Easier than that - have a work function that rearms only if there's
more work to do in the future. You only arm the timer when you
have work to do, and it only rearms if there's more work to
do in the future (e.g. rotating expiry lists).
i.e. while there's more work to do, you need to call
cancel_rearming_delayed_work() to stop it reliably, but if you race
with the work function not restarting itself, you hang.....
Cheers,
Dave.
