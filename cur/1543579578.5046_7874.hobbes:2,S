The `CONFIG_FB' entry in Documentation/Configure.help says:

XFree86 4.x is not fbdev-aware (yet), unless you specify some `UseFBDev' option
keyword (exact syntax may differ, I don't run 4.x yet).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
