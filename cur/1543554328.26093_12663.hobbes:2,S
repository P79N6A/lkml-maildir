Subject: sendfile(2) fails for devices?

sendfile(2) fails with -EINVAL every time I try to read from a device
file.
This sounds like a bug... is it?  (the man page doesn't mention such a
restriction)
I am using kernel 2.4.0-test11-pre2.  All other tests with sendfile(2)
succeed:  file->file, file->STDOUT, STDIN->file...
