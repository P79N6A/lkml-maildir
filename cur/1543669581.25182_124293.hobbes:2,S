Badari,
In 2.5 lets assume the /dev/sd[a-z][a-z][a-z]
device addressing is left as is (more or less). To
identify lots of disks the Vital Product Data page 0x83
(failing that, the disk serial number) should be used.
This information is available via sysfs (thanks to
Patrick Mansfield and Mike Anderson).
# cd /sys/bus/scsi/devices
# find . -follow -name 'name' -exec cat {} \; -print
SIBM     DNES-309170W            AJF98887
./1:0:4:0/name
SFUJITSU MAM3184MP       UKS0P2300CK0
./0:0:1:0/name
It is relatively easy to write user space tools to show
this information:
# lsscsi -n
[0:0:1:0]    disk    FUJITSU  MAM3184MP        0106  /dev/sda
   name: SFUJITSU MAM3184MP       UKS0P2300CK0
[1:0:4:0]    disk    IBM      DNES-309170W     SA30  /dev/sdb
   name: SIBM     DNES-309170W            AJF98887
Each pair of lines links the transient topological and device
node name ("0:0:1:0" and "dev/sda" respectively) with a
(hopefully) invariant "name" for that device.
So if that name was hashed there would be a reasonable mapping
from that name to the current Linux scsi disk device node name
(e.g. /dev/sda). So user space tools could work out the mapping
and provide the "memory" from one boot to the next (and across
the deletion and re-addition of HBA modules).
