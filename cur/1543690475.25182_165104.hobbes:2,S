I reported a problem to the lkml (see "PROBLEM: Powerquest Drive 
Image let the kernel panic" and "PROBLEM: kernel panic when accessing 
data via samba") describing a kernel panic when accessing a huge 
amount of data via samba. Unfortunately I didn't get any response 
yet.
I'm using a SuSE 8.2 distribution with kernel 2.4.20.

I'm getting similar errors:
kernel: hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
kernel: hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04Aborted Command 
I don't get any IRQ routing conflicts.
But in my configuration hdc is a cd-rom attached to the onboard IDE.

My onboard IDE is an Intel 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE. My two harddisks 
(each 120GB of size) are attached to a Promise Ultra 133TX2 
controller.
