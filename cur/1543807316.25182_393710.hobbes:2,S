The lock will only be taken in non-atomic context. In particular, if a 
mem1394 device is to be removed after cable unplug, the code will be run 
by knodemgrd.
What is more recommendable for mutual exclusion in non-atomic context 
(here also with very low probality of lock contention, given the current 
implementation of ieee1394) --- a mutex or a spinlock?
