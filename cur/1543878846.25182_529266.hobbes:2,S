On 32-bit platforms, *not* using _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 is already today
a stupid thing to do.  There are several places where things simply
break in today's world.
Once you do use 53-bit offsets (and we always do this for 64-bit
platforms) telldir returns a 64-bit cookie.  So, no problem.  The one
big issue is that there are no error values for telldir.  There was no
need so far.  But a) we can change this or b) we can really go
stronger in the direction to deprecate 32-bit ops and force people to
update their code.
