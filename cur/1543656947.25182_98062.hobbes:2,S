How about using logical destination mode when programming the IOAPIC?
Currently we do physical in io_apic.c (the reason why it breaks on NUMAQ)
This way we can get node affinity just by setting the Destination Field
for an IOREDTBL to APIC_BROADCAST_ID and also targetting single cpus on a
node becomes node generic.
