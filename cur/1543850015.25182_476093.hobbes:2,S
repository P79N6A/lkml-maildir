Atomic updates require either double-buffering the data (twice worse
than mere caching...) or locking away access during update (in which
case the order doesn't mater).
But yes, lack of atomicity in sysfs is a big issue. We don't seem to
have any ABI convention for providing atomic snapshots of those
dozen-small-atribute directories.

Yes, hwmon ignores merrily ignores this issue, as do all other
data-through-sysfs drivers I've looked at. Except for the patched
hdaps driver in the tp_smapi package, which has a (very) rudimentary
solution via caching and a configurable in-kernel polling timer.
