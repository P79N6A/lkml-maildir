I don't like the way, new features are introduced into or old things are 
removed from kernel, too. But i think, it makes no sense for me to complain 
about, as i'm not that linux-kernel-guru. I hope, the patch i posted or 
another one doing the same, will be accepted to allow users to burn again.
Some fine-tuning is still necessary.
