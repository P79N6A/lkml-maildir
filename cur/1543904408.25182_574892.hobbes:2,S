I hit something similar:
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o: In function `acpi_pci_choose_state':
drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c:253: undefined reference to `acpi_pm_device_sleep_state'
drivers/built-in.o: In function `pnpacpi_suspend':
drivers/pnp/pnpacpi/core.c:124: undefined reference to
`acpi_pm_device_sleep_state'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
I also have CONFIG_SMP=y and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n
Will try to investigate more...
