I'm not sure what the cause of this is, but this does indeed to be a 
common problem. This is the second e-mail today on lkml about this and 
i've seen it logged against a couple of distros. 
I've hit it on a test system as well, which runs 2.4.9, 2.4.21, without
problems, but hits the above error on 2.6.9, and the system becomes
completely unresponsive. Another note of interest is that i've seen the 
following message in the logs:
psmouse.c: Wheel Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization,

So indeed it seems like some sort of timing issue?
