I think I've seen the same problem on one of my (similar spec) laptops.
Serial console was useless. On resume, there's a short spew of garbage
(just like if the baud rate were misconfigured) over serial before it
locks up completely. Adjusting the speed on the other end of the cable 
made no difference, nothing but garbage comes out.
Maybe serial needs some suspend/resume hooks to reinitialise state ?

If it's the same problem I'm seeing, it's still there in rc5.
I'll continue to poke at it when I get time.
