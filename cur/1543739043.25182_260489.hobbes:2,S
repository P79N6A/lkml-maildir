You have to some of the ELF verification anyway, otherwise your suggested way
is just as pointless. You had included somde code in your example, but what
that did wasn't sufficient either - it can trivially be broken.
I think we should verify the ELF anyway upon module load; it doesn't take very
long, and the data cache works in our favour. This then means we can drop some
checks later on in the module loading because we can trust the ELF to a known
extent.
