WTF?  The only interpretation I can think of is about unions in struct
inode and struct superblock.  _If_ you add a filesystem that
	a) doesn't do separate allocation of fs-private parts of
inode/superblock (i.e. doesn't use ->u.gerneric_ip and ->u.generic_sbp) and
	b) hadn't been known at kernel compile time and
	c) has one of these fields (member in inode->u or sb->u) bigger than
all filesystems known at compile time
- yes, you've got a problem.
Solution: use ->u.generic_<...>.  Works fine.
Not to mention the fact that VFS per se doesn't give a damn for fs types.
All it needs is sizeof(struct inode) and sizeof(struct superblock).  And
any fs using ->generic_<...> (i.e. pointer to separately allocated private
objects) is OK, whether it was known at build time or not.
