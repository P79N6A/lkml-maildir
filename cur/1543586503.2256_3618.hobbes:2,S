Me three... I am much better at tech than flames although I seemed to have missed all the 
flambe.
BTW... why is this thread called Road Runner?

The converse is true as well.. Having only used the CFA devices as solid state IDE drives I 
was unaware that there were any that didn't do the True IDE mode.

Yes... Now that I am up on the docs I see exactly how this can happen.  Mishandled signals 
would cause device 0 to go 30 seconds before it gave up on Device 1.
Andre, do you think it's reasonable to assume that if most PC BIOS's will detect the CFA then 
it probally is handling the POR sequence and EXECUTE DEVICE DIAGNOSIC correctly?
If so then I feel pretty confident that it should work ok.. Over the 2 years we have been 
using CFAs as solid state HD's I have never seen a case where the BIOS didn't autodetect it 
properly as master or slave or have I had a problem with a long timeout.  I have plugged it 
up to all manner of machine old and new.. An the usual configuration was that the CFA was 
Device 0 and some random IDE drive we have laying around was device 1.
Now I am not saying it won't happen.. just that I haven't seen it.

Not to mention that the datasheet for the device indicates that this is possible and intended  
not just happenstance.  *grin*

Yes I think so... Although I haven't done a rigorous reading of the SanDisk datasheet I 
haven't found anything so far that would lead me to believe that operates any different than 
an ATA-2 device when operating in True IDE mode.
IIRC SanDisk was the original people to come out with IDE CFA and everyone else just copied 
them.  I have the SanDisk datasheets that I can send you if you need them to verify stuff.  I 
believe that if you verify it with the SanDisk then all the other MFG's should work as well.
