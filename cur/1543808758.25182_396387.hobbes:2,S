We're talking here about a system from 1999 where Windows 98
refuses to run in ACPI mode and instead runs in APM mode.
So I don't consider a regression on this box as "serious" --
I consider that it works in ACPI mode at all as "miraculous":-)
However, I do think the issue merits investigation in the event
that it has an effect on systems newer than 6 years old.
thanks,
