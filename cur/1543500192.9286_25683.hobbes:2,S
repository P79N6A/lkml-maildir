You've just described what podfuk does. Actually, it is bad idea to
use url style (just about every unix app knows // == /), and it is bad
idea to use / as component separator in url, because "what should cd
http:// do?". 
But yes I currently have open("/#url:http:||ssss.yyyyy.dd/~silly",
O_RDONLY) working. I also have chdir("/#ftp:host.name") working. And
this all in 300 lines of c code (+ midnight commander turned into
library). You want to see

name does not offend you... :-)]

PS: Podfuk is not multithreaded, and it should be. But it works
reliably for over 2 years (I think).
