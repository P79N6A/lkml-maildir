f_owner locking rules are per-filesystem: some of them have this lock 
irq-safe [because they use it in irq-context generated SIGIOs], some of 
them have it irq-unsafe [because they dont generate SIGIOs in irq 
context]. The lock validator meshes them together and produces a false 
positive. The workaround changed all uses of f_owner.lock to be 
irq-safe.

the real fix would be to correctly map the 'key' of the f_owner.lock to 
the filesystem. I.e. to embedd a "lockdep_type_key s_fown_key" in 
'struct file_system_type', and to use that key when initializing 
f_own.lock.
the practical problem is that the initialization site of f_owner.lock 
does not know about which filesystem this file will belong to.
there might be another way though: the only non-core user of f_own.lock 
is CIFS, and that use of f_own.lock seems unnecessary - it does not 
change any fowner state, and its justification for taking that lock 
seems rather vague as well:
 *  GlobalSMBSesLock protects:
 *      list operations on tcp and SMB session lists and tCon lists
 *  f_owner.lock protects certain per file struct operations
maybe CIFS or VFS people could comment?
that way you could remove the following patch from -mm:
   lock-validator-fown-locking-workaround.patch
and add the patch below. (the fcntl.c portion of the above patch is 
meanwhile moot)

Subject: CIFS: remove f_owner.lock use
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
CIFS takes/releases f_owner.lock - why? It does not change anything
in the fowner state. Remove this locking.
