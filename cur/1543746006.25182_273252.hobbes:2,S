Note that while I agree that it sounds sensible, it would be good to have 
somebody specify exactly what changes from the use of "-ffreestanding".
I _assume_ that all the things that gcc takes for granted are things that 
Linux already has its own definitions for, and that -ffreestanding doesn't 
actually change anything for at least the regular architectures. But if 
there is any object code changes, can you check those out and explain 
them?
