   I don't like a panic for a thing that we can recover gracefully and
   allowing the user to also see the message even if he was running under X 8).
Fine,so make it set a standard timeout and do a printk instead.  This is
a "never can happen" situation, right?
	if (!timeout) {
		timeout = tp->rto;
		if (!timeout) {
			printk("Bugcheck: tcp_send_delayed_ack ato and rto are 0");
			timeout = HZ/50;
	}
