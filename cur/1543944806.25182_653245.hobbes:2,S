So let's say, like my first example from the previous email, that you have 
MPOL_INTERLEAVE | MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES over nodes 3-4 and your cpuset's 
mems is only nodes 5-7.  This would interleave over no nodes.  Correct?
It seems like MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES is primarily designed to maintain a 
certain order among the nodes it effects the mempolicy over.  It comes 
with the premise that the task doesn't already know it's cpuset mems 
(otherwise, the current implementation without MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES would 
work fine for this) so it doesn't really care what nodes it allocates 
pages on, it just cares about the order.
This works for MPOL_PREFERRED and MPOL_BIND as well, right?
I don't understand the use case for this (at all), but if you have 
workloads that require this type of setting then I can implement this as 
part of my series.  I just want to confirm that there are real world cases 
backing this so that we don't have flags with highly highly specialized 
cornercases.
 [ If a user _does_ specify MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES | MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES
   as part of their syscall, then we'll simply return -EINVAL. ]

Well, there's advantages and disadvantages to either approach.
My preference (both mode and flags stored in the same member of struct 
mempolicy):
   Advantages:
	- completely consistent with the userspace API of passing modes
	  and flags together in a pointer to an int, and
	- does not require additional formals to be added to several
	  functions, including functions outside mm/mempolicy.c.
   Disadvantage:
	- use of mpol_mode() throughout mm/mempolicy.c code to mask
	  off optional mode flags for conditionals or switch statements.
Your preference (separate mode and flags members in struct mempolicy):
   Advantages:
	- clearer implementation when dealing with modes: all existing
	  statements involving pol->policy can remain unchanged.
   Disadvantages:
	- requires additional formals to be added to several functions,
	  including functions outside mm/mempolicy.c, and
	- takes additional space in struct mempolicy (two bytes) which
	  could eventually be used for something else.
In both cases the testing of mode flags is the same as before:
	if (pol->policy & MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES) {
		...
	}
