Gene, dont bother applying the patch to the cvs code -- It is obviously 
correct, so I have merged it into v4l-dvb cvs.
A simple cvs checkout will get you everything you need.
If you like, try to apply it against the kernel, without using cvs.
Anyhow, surely it will work.  Thank you Gene, Don and Perry for helping 
us to solve this bug......... Hopefully we'll be able to get the fix 
into 2.6.15.
Cheers,
