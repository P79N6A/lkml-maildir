All that buggy infrastructure talks together, yes.  Those dpm_*()
calls are in the same "will remove" task item.

This class of bug is also called a "design bug" or sometimes "mistake".

Odd how the relevant Suse developers didn't mention any issues with
those files going away, any of the times problems with them were
discussed on the PM list.  Also, I have a Suse system that doesn't
use those files for anything ... maybe only newer release use it.
I've got some Ubuntu going too, which hasn't (visibly) suffered from
any of these changes.
