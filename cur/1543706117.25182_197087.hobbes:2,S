I captured dmesg and /proc/ide/piix, but forgot to post them. They're at work
now. But I did the change, by commenting out the call to eighty_ninety_three()
in piix.c, and my disks came back to 54 MB/s each, and 64 MB/s cumulated.
dmesg showed UDMA33 before and now displays UDMA100 again. But I obviously
cannot let it like that because if I install this kernel in a 40-pin machine,
I will get some surprizes !

I'm certain that this one changed before and after the patch, but I cannot
tell you what the differences were.

I understand. But could you please post your ICH5 detection code so that I
can try it on this machine. I still can play with it for a few days before
it gets racked. And I can try with both 40 and 80-pin cables.

Now the only thing you can do is to count how many days elapse before you
get your first spam...
