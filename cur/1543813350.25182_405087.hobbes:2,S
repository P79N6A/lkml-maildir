Nope, just a bogon.

Grumble.  it's a fairly small struct, much less than a page in length,
and userspace needs an atomic view of it, instead of reading each of the
umpteen broken-out files that we also provide for humean-readable access
to each counter.
I didn't see any point to implementing the sysfs binary file interface
in order to do exactly what this 6-line function does.  Still don't, in
fact :-)
