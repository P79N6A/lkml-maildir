OK.
I haven't done kernel profiling before.  Did a little googling and this is
what I think I know (2.4.x)
In lilo.conf, do append="profile=2" (is 2 a good number?)
reboot
echo > /proc/profile
readprofile -m System.map-2.4.24 (or whatever)
Is that correct?
Of course, this problem happens fastest on productions machines, which I
hate to put out of commission...  I need to turn my attention to some
other stuff for a bit today, but tonight I'll see if I can't work
something up on a non-production machine to make it go bad.  Then do some
profiling.
