Yes exactly.  That's one reason why I posted the patch.  Different
sybsystems that need this type of functionality shouldn't have to
individually reinvent the wheel.  With a single implementation, code
is more compact and easier to understand and maintain.  I would argue
that code maintenance is of particular concern to code such as NMI
and machine check handlers because bugs in this type of code can be
hard to track down.
