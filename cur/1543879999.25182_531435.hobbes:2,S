 fixed the issue
I have the same system as Mattia, and when I applied this patch and turned
CPU_IDLE back on, I got a panic on boot. Unfortunately, the EIP scrolled off
screen, so I can't get a line number.
(I had the same STR breakage as him; STR did not work with CPU_IDLE turned
on, and it did work with CPU_IDLE turned off.)
I'm running +rc6+mm(April 11) on a Sony VAIO SZ.
