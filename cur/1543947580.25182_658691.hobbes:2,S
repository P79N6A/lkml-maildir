Having read those threads, it looks to me as though:
- the parts of Max's problem that would be solved by cpusets can be
mostly accomplished just via sched_setaffinity()
- Motohiro wants to add a new system-wide API that you would also like
to have available on a per-cpuset basis. (Why not just add two access
points for the same feature?)
I'm don't think that either of these would be enough to justify big
changes to cpusets or cgroups, although eliminating bloat is always a
good thing.

I'm not sure that either of these would make much difference to the
overall footprint.
A single layer of cpusets would allow you to simplify
validate_change() but not much else.
I don't see how a fixed upper limit on the number of cpusets makes the
locking sufficiently simpler to save much code.

If we wanted to go this way, I can imagine a cgroups config option
that forces just a single hierarchy, which would allow a bunch of
simplifications that would save plenty of text.

On x86_64 they're:
cgroup.o: 17348
cpuset.o: 8533
