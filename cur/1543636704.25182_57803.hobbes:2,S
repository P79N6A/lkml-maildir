The way the Linux community works is first you show that it works, then 
you ask others to follow you.  In 2.6 we will show that it works.  In 
2.7 we will ask others to consider adopting it.  In 5-15 years, some of 
them will.  Trust me that there is no queue of other FS authors seeking 
to take advantage of our code, and complaining that we are locking them 
out from our transactions API.  Shoot, some of them are still using 
linear search directories and not packing small files together into one 
block.;-)
So, we are not hiding it under a carpet in ioctl, we are doing something 
clean and powerful and general enough to be usable by any other storage 
layer that chooses to implement the required functions.
We need to compete with Microsoft's OFS.  We have a tight and busy 
schedule if we are to ship a filesystem offering superior semantics for 
semi-structured data queries with a clean and powerful code architecture 
behind it, and ship it before OFS ships.  Reiser4 gets the storage layer 
foundation in place, and reduces the amount of code required for the 
later stages several fold.  It also provides a framework for several 
serious approaches to security problems (like giving apps a transactions 
API), and has some features that are just plain nifty (e.g. inheritance).
All of this squabbling over filesystem (distro) competition within Linux 
is just a distraction from the important job of getting something ready 
for when OFS comes over that hill over yonder there.....  unless you 
want to hear from your friends in 2004+ about the superior namespace 
integration Longhorn offers in Windows compared to Linux, and how it 
makes everything simpler....
