That's the LIST_POISON stuff: 00100100 is the "bad list pointer". Somebody
tried to remove a page twice.
Doesn't mean a lot - if your "struct page" got corrupted, anything can
happen. Quite possibly it's a double free.

It might be more useful to leave it as RAID0, if you're willing to try out
patches to try to debug this. The slab-debugging thing I sent out earlier
is one such patch (but may well cause out-of-memory problems under load),
and possibly the atomic-decrement checker patch (appended). And maybe Jens
and Neil can come up with something..
