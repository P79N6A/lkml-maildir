Well, if all the UTF-8 diddling is eventually done by glibc, or some
other library, it might just be made to work.
The keep-it-in-UTF-8-all-the-time thing will still break down when a
user inputs a filename by copying the display of a badly encoded
filename using GPM, or in X, but that isn't a kernel issue.
I still don't really get what enforcing strictly standards compliant
UTF-8 has to do with backwards compatibility, though.
_But_ at least I'm about 5% more confident that filenames won't
suddenly blow up in my face, so I can sleep soundly tonight :-).
John.
