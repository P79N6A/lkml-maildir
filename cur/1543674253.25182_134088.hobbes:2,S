Not in my case :(, i'm using a not very recent intel ethernet card:
00:0c.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 08)

I was getting a lot more, look:
[huma@fargo] [~] % grep csum /var/log/messages|grep "May 19"| wc -l
    443
[huma@fargo] [~] % grep csum /var/log/messages|grep "May 18"| wc -l
    486
[huma@fargo] [~] % grep csum /var/log/messages|grep "May 17"| wc -l
    425
[huma@fargo] [~] % grep csum /var/log/messages|grep "May 16"| wc -l
    953
[huma@fargo] [~] % grep csum /var/log/messages|grep "May 15"| wc -l
   1023
[huma@fargo] [~] % grep csum /var/log/messages|grep "May 14"| wc -l
    911
I've been a long time without noticing this problem, but looking casually
for another reason at the logs get me to finding these checksum errors hell ;))
