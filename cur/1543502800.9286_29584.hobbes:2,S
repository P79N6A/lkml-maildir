0 wouldn't be acceptable for 2.3.x, as it CAN be a kernel address on a
number of machines. But as the problem doesn't exist in 2.3.x anyway I
guess that is a non-issue.
It's a singularly ugly fix, regardless. I would never let code like that
near any of my kernels, but Alan is the one who gets to decide in the
stable tree.
