I agree we should do the best thing possible without any prior
knowledge of what a process should do. I don't agree we should add
pointless complexity to the scheduler for dubious gains (getting rid
of the very short ramp up time). Of course, if you think it's useful,
feel free to implement it and let's resume the discussion when we have
some numbers.
