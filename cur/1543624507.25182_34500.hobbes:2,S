Someone "fixed" the 2.5 one by just frobbing randomly with the
io_request_lock without noticing its not always used per queue in the driver
(study the host list code - and dont think you can just clean that up by
 using SHIRQ - that wont help on some non x86 stuff). I fed Dave Jones
the 2.4 stuff where the locking is fixed (tho using io_request_lock) and
actually works SMP.
Dave then I suspect fed it to Linus
