We all know that.

This is completely incorrect.
Of *course* they're contiguous.  That's the whole point.
It's not exactly hard to lock four pages which are contiguous in pagecache,
contiguous in physical memory and are contiguous in the radix-tree.

That's just spin.

No it doesn't and please stop spinning.  x86 ptes map 4k pages and the core
MM needs changes to continue to work with this hack in place.
If x86 had larger pagesize we wouldn't be seeing any of this.  It is a workaround
for present-generation hardware.

Were any cleanups made which were not also applicable as standalone things

I see no cleanups which are not also applicable to mainline.

It pretends that pages are large than they actually are, forcing the
pte-management code to also play along with the pretence.
Pages *aren't* 16k.  They're 4k.

That's spin as well.
Please address my point: if in five years time x86 has larger or varible
pagesize, this code will be a permanent millstone around our necks which we
*should not have merged*.
And if in five years time x86 does not have larger pagesize support then
the manufacturers would have decided that 4k pages are not a performance
problem, so we again should not have merged this code.

You cannot say this.  I'm sitting here *watching* you refuse to seriously
consider alternatives.
And you've conspicuously failed to address my point regarding the
*permanent* additional maintenance cost.
Anyway.  Let's await those performance numbers.  If they're notably good,
and if we judge that this goodness will be realised on more than one
arguably-crippled present-day disk adapter then we can evaluate the
*various* options which we have for stuffing more data into that adapter.
