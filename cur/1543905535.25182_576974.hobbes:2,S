Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core fixes for 2.6.23-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/30/378

Here are some driver core fixes and documentation updates against your
2.6.23-rc1 git tree.
They fix the CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n build error and help provide a better hint
at what is going wrong when loading modules cause sysfs errors.  And
there are a bunch of documentation updates in here too, as well as a
driver model fix that causes some people problems with the input
subsystem.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
