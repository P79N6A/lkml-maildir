Actually, the major criticism was that a new architecture can't be wedged into 
the arch/i386 directory without changing an awful lot of critical files, which 
is true (and also undesirable from a QA standpoint).
I addressed that by doing the i386 subarchitecture rework (which allows me to 
slide all the voyager stuff in to the side). However, that still does a 
hatchet job on arch/i386.  There are also several other people working on 
related issues in arch/i386, so it has become a slow job.  The current status 
is
- PCI rework - In Linus Kernel
- setup/cpu rework - in DJ kernel
I get to wait until the setup/cpu rework makes it to the Linus kernel so I can 
slot in the arch subdivisions around it.
