It does steal timeslices from other processes to complete tcp_recvmsg()
task. But I do not think it will  take long. When processing backlog, the
processed packets will go to the receive buffer, the TCP flow control will
take effect to slow down the sender.
The data receiving process might be preempted by higher priority processes.
Only the data recieving process stays in the active array, the problem is
not that bad because the process might resume its execution soon. The worst
case is that it expires and is moved to the active array with packets within
the backlog queue.
