There is at least one, perhaps a few, policies that I'd like to see in
the current allocator as well.
In particular, I am working on preparing a patch proposal for a policy
that would kill a task rather than invoke the swapper.  In
mm/page_alloc.c __alloc_pages(), if one gets down to the point of being
about to kick the swapper, if this policy is enabled (and you're not
in_interrupt() and don't have flag PF_MEMALLOC set), then ask
oom_kill_task() to shoot us instead.  For some big HPC jobs that are
carefully sized to fit on the allowed memory nodes, swapping is a fate
worse than death.
The natural place (for me, anyway) to hang such policies is off the
cpuset.
I am hopeful that cpusets will soon hit Linus's tree.
Would it make sense to specify these buddy allocator fallback policies
per cpuset as well?
I'd be glad to investigate providing the cpuset part of the code,
exposing the appropriate boolean, enum, scalar or bitmap type(s) to user
land query and setting, as another file in each cpuset directory, if
that would facilitate this.
