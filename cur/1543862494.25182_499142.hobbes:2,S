I have a process who allocates as much as possible of RAM
in 4 G ram 32bit machine.  This buffer is never released.
Questions:
1. Is it better allocates with many 1MB buffers or allocate it in with
one a big valloc ?
2. I will be needing to make this memory allocation in many other
machines , some have 2 GRAM and some 3 GRAM. what is the preferrable
method  ?
3. In 64bit machines , is it possible to allocate huge buffers , such
as 30 GB of ram ?
Thank you
