We want to minimize the amount of code in the kernel and avoid having to update the driver each time a new system management command is added.

The libsmbios project is being updated to use this code.  
http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios/main/.
  Using the libsmbios code, you will be able to set all of the options in BIOS F2 screen from Linux userspace.  Also, libsmbios is looking at implementing a few other things like fan status.  Libsmbios is 100% open-source (OSL/GPL dual license).

The power cycle feature of the system powers off the system for a few seconds and then powers the system back on without user intervention.  shutdown() and reboot() don't provide that feature.

The method of generating a host control SMI is not exactly the same for each PowerEdge system listed in dcdbas.txt.  host_control_smi_type tells the driver how to generate the host control SMI for the system in use.  I'll update dcdbas.txt with the SMI type value associated with the systems listed in that file.

This driver is not needed by the RBU code.
