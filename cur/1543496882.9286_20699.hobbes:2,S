I ran into trouble with 2.2.9 + linux raid stuff (raid-1 mirror doesn't
finish synchronisation) using latest version of ingos 0145 alpha patches; 
I traced the problem as far as the changes to the scheduler which first
appeared 2.2.7-ac3.
Backing out these changes from 2.2.9 (or from 2.2.7-ac3) gives me working
raid again - perhaps this is responsible for other problems as well? These
2.2.8/9 changes were backed out:
arch/i386/kernel/process.c 
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S
include/asm-i386/system.h
include/linux/sched.h
kernel/sched.c
In the raid code, the problem seems to be that wait_on_buffer calls used in
md_do_sync lock after a few successfull calls (either reading the blocks to
be synched or writing them  - how soon and which one actually locks seems
to be pretty much random) when used with the new scheduler.
Bye, Martin
