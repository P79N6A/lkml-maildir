ok - but i think there should at least be an option to turn the
poll()-ing off. To showcase the best-possible wakeup latency offered by
the kernel :-)
poll() is quite complex and with a good number of locks in the path the
maximum latency increases accordingly.
btw., couldnt jackd use a separate input and output thread (of identical
priority), to be purely read()/write() based? This method should also
solve the priority problems of poll(): the thread woken up later will do
the work later. (hence the _earlier_ interrupt source will be handled
first.) With poll() how do you tell which fd needs attention first, if
both are set?
