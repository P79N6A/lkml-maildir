Subject: [RFC] Update/kill Documentation/sysctl/* docs?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/8/207

In 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6145
 you asked to update
the sysctl docs. I've updated them and added/deleted the neccesary
stuff (except the ones that I don't know what on earth are they doing
because they're not...documented). However it looks like there's
duplication - Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt seems to document all
that aswell (but in a single doc, which makes it a bit unreadable 
for such big document, IMO)
What should be the best step? Kill Documentation/sysctl/ and keep 
filesystems/proc.txt updated and maybe split it in several files
to make it more readable? Update it but maintain in sync with
filesystems/proc.txt? delete proc.txt and keep sysctl/ updated...?
