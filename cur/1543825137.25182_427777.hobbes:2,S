Thanks....
but more helpful than a spelling fix would be a chunk of elisp that I
could stick in my .emacs, which would automatically turn on flyspell
mode in Kconfig files, and inside comments in .c and .h files.
The first bit is probably trivial.  The second has got to be
possible...
Or maybe just keep posting patches like this in the hope of shaming
people like me into learning how to spell....
;-)
Thanks.
