I am getting this error
drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: dc00: host controller process error.
something bad happened
drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: dc00: host controller halted. very bad
usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 2
hub 1-0:0: debounce: port 1: delay 100ms stable 4 status 0x301
hub 1-0:0: new USB device on port 1, assigned address 3
input: USB HID v1.10 Mouse [Logitech USB Mouse] on usb-00:0d.0-1
What happens is that the mouse just turns off but it will work again if I
unplug it and plug it back in again. When I first start up 2.5.56 it will
often work for a few hours up to about 16 hours before usb will just start
having those error messages. However once that happens and I unplug the
mouse and plug it back in again the problem will happen every minute or
so.
It is a VIA kt333 chipset with a usb mouseman wheel logitech optical mouse
This issue does not happen under any 2.4.x kernel.
Also this board has both an UHCI and an EHCI controller and if I compile
support for the EHCI and UHCI controllers into a 2.5 series kernel when
the host controller halts like that unplugging the mouse and plugging it back in
again does not work. Under a 2.4 kernel both UHCI and EHCI controllers can
be enabled and working without these problems.
Thanks
