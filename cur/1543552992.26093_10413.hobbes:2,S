Umm... because the size of a ramdisk is fixed, but the size of a ramfs is
flexible?
I can certainly understand this problem... I might in fact do exactly
this in the next version of my SuperRescue disk.  There, the ramdisk
which is the real root is populated from a .tar.gz file; the initrd is
just there to unpack the .tar.gz file onto the "real" ramdisk; the initrd
is then jettisoned.
Why not just have the real root be the initrd, you ask?  It's too large:
since an initrd needs to exist in both compressed form and uncompressed
form in memory at the same time; it would mean SuperRescue would no
longer work on systems with 64 MB RAM.  If I went to ramfs it might
actually work on systems with 48 MB RAM, albeit you better not need to
much space in / (or conversely, it would suddenly let you put a whole lot
more stuff in /tmp if you have 512 MB.)
