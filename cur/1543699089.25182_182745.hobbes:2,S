Oh come on, google for "udev FAQ".  It's been posted here a number of
times...

udev is a user program, and it's documentation is not in the kernel
tree.  It's within the source of udev, and is quite extensive.

There is neither.  You always get sysfs in 2.6, and udev is a user
program.  No kernel options to enable (well, you do need CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled I guess...)
Please read the udev docs and FAQ, it is there for a reason.
