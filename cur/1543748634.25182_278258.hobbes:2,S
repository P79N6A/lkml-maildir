The interpreter idea is somewhat interesting, especially if the "language"
can be actually "compiled" into some threaded format or similar. I suspect 
that a number of special devices that you don't want to maintain a 
real kernel module for could be handled that way.
However, I also suspect that such a thing would eventually explode with 
special cases and support for new features people want, to the point 
where it gets quite complex, and a kernel module might be easier after all ;)
