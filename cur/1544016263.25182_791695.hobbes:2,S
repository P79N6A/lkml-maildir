It is not about the possibility to change the sources, but the way
interface is exported to the userspace. Right now it is not usable for
some cases. And forcing applications, which are actually cross-platform,
depending on the way linux controls its own oom-killer is noticebly more
hackish than selecting a system-wide process by its name.

It is not about who is protected, but who will be selected to be killed.
If you have a rogue application which happend to have the right name,
everything is ok, otherwise it should be tuned further. And even in that
case nothing harmless will happen, since another processes will be
killed first (since admin selected the name on purpose to kill
potentially damaging applications).

You believe that changing apache to control oom_adj is the right way to
deal with linux oom-killer? Do we already flight to the moon?
