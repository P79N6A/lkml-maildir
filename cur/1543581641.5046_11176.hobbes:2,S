Sorry, but it turns out that the bug is not completely
fixed by the change that acme made.  With the change,
ifup-ing and if-downing eth0 with the ipx module loaded
no longer reduces eth0's refcnt to an indefinitely low
(larger and larger negative) number.  However if the ipx
module is loaded first and ipx configured on eth0, and
then the network card inserted and "ifconfig eth0 up" done,
and then "ifconfig eth0 down" done, then once again the
refcnt is too low, so that when I try to "cardctl eject"
my ethernet card, "modprobe -r xirc2ps_cs" hangs up.
This whole business of refcnts needs to be thought 
through more carefully.
