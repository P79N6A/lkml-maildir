Subject: [PATCH] Fix missing parens in set_personality()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/9/78

If you call set_personality() with an expression such as:
	set_personality(foo ? PERS_FOO1 : PERS_FOO2);
then this evaluates to:
	((current->personality == foo ? PERS_FOO1 : PERS_FOO2) ? ...
which is obviously not the intended result.  Add the missing parents
to ensure this gets evaluated as expected:
	((current->personality == (foo ? PERS_FOO1 : PERS_FOO2)) ? ...
