Which seems rather unnatural to me.  All other merge architectures have
ARCH=<archdir> where archdir is the name under arch, e.g. mips, powerpc,
s390.  They then have a CONFIG_FOO_64 and set the utsname and -m32/-m64
respectively.  It would be nice if x86 could behave like all other
architectures in this respect.  Especially as the behaviour of the other
architectures is a lot more intuitive.
