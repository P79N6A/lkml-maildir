No.
For me, 2.5.63 was the best. Or perhaps it was .64 or .65?
What I know is that the best CPU scheduler was the one previous 
to the "interactivity changes" from Linus. I mean, if Linus' changes
went in .65, then it's .64, etc.
Perhaps for other people it's .69....probably it also depends a lot
on the hardware side. For me .63 was "good"
