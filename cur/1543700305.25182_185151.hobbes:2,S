teve Ratcliffe, Master Software Project Estimator, has most correctly
estimated the release of the Linux version 2.6 kernel. On January 6,
2001 (within 4 hours of when the 2.6 kernel pool was opened), he entered
a guess which was accurate within 15 hours. Check the results for some
interesting statistics and submit your guess for the 2.8 pool.
