Hmf... some of these seem to be outright omissions (pivot_root() and 
umount2() especially), and probably indicate bugs or that the stock 
kernel isn't up to date anymore.
I can see umount() being missing (as in "use umount2()").  time() I 
guess can be emulated with gettimeofday(), but select() being missing is 
rather odd (is this a "emulate using poll()" philosophy?  Barf...)
If the maintainers of the above ports could give me a pointer to how the 
above system calls are expected to be done I'd appreciate it.  I'll 
probably look through the glibc sources for hints in the meantime.
