That's odd... Has the CD drive ever given you any problems before?
And since you report it as a 2.3.43 problem, I assume that it worked
fine in 2.3.42?
Hmm. Any chance you can trace that a bit for me? There were no
ide-cd or ide changes in 2.3.43 that could possibly cause this.
Does isofs work with, say, a file mounted over the loop device?
