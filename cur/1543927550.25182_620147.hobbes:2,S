Something cleaner would be nice, yes.  I'll leave it to you to decide.

Back when I knew something about make, all commands ran with sh -ec.
Ah, progress.  Anyway, the one you cited does not have any commands that
aren't tested with && or if already.  set -e would have no effect.

Using this rule for the 64-bit vDSO is not in this patch.
Patch 18/18 defines VDSO_LDFLAGS_vdso.lds for this.

This line is not being changed in this patch, so that is really a separate
question.  Other places in other Makefiles use @mkdir too, so if you are
concerned you could do a patch covering all of those.
Thanks,
