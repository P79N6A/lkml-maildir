when my hawking tech 802.11b card gets heavily loaded (tar | bzip2 >
nfs_file) i see these errors repeated at a very high rate:

then it eventually, in this case after 40 minutes, turns to repeating
this at a slower rate:

once this is scrolling, the keyboard ceases to respond.  the mouse
works in x, and i can close things, but i can't type or switch vt's.
alt-sysrq does work though.
i've probably been seeing this behavior since the 2.5.5x kernels, but 
that's probably when i got the wireless card.
this report is from the 2.5.66 kernel, but it looks the same as
earlier kernels.  i'm using the orinoco_cs module on debian unstable
on my dell inspiron 3800.
i have not been able to reproduce the error with processes other than
my tar | bzip2 > (nfs-mounted-file).
thanks.
