Depends on how you count...
If all .h files followed the rule - they should be selfcontained. In
other words they should all include what they need this is correct.
The correct figure is much less.
I did a check with defconfig for i386.
There are 7 .o files where config.h is not included - all are correct.
lib/errno.c, arch/ia386/boot/bootsect.S + a few more.
That was out of 983 .o files.
There will be no slowdown introducing -iinclude (or -imacros) keeping
these figures in mind.
find -name '.*.o.cmd' | xargs grep __KERNEL__ to find number of .o files
build.
added grep -l 'include/linux/config.h' to find .o files build and where
config-h was included. Then a simple diff..
