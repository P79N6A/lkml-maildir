The pci_dma code on the x86_64 platform is broken for the case of PCI
devices with < 32bit DMA. Has been forever, this is a problem with
various devices, although most of the others are obsolete except for the
bcm43xx and b44 (the latter has hacks to work around the x86-64
brokenness).
At the very least the pci_set_dma_mask should error in this situation or
switch to using GFP_DMA (24bit) memory spaces. Having it error isn't the
whole solution as you still need some way to handle the "what do I do
next".
