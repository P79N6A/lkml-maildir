The check is there to catch situations where a function is marked
__init but referenced after a potential discard of the it sections.
So if there is no-one discarding the .plt section then we should be all
safe.
Browsing the um code I could not see how .plt was thought used so I
added it to the ignorelist in modpost.

As for .bss this is a much more generic section - so for now this is not
added. Can you explain why there is a reference to do_mount_root from
.bss or is this a bug in modpost pointing out something wrong?
With the above patch we are down to two section mismatch warnings for
a defconfig build on x86_64.
