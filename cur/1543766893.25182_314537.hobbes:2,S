It's automatically enforced, since the mount syscall itself will use
the same path lookup mechanism as any other filesystem operation.

Yes, because a later mount on a _same_ dentry will mask an earlier
mount.  But that does not mean, that the mount happened on the private
mount's root.
You can check where the mount ended up, by having a shell of 'x' cd to
the private mount.  Then do the overmount.  If the shell can still see
the private mount, then the overmount did not in fact mount over the
private root.

Yes it makes sense, but I think what you want is already the case.
Thanks,
