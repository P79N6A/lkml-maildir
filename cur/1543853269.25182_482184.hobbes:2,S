Are you sure? I thought that these bits will only affect the SATA
communication between the chipset on the motherboard and the chipset
on the drive and are not related to the drive's spinning at all.
Please note that the patch is incorrect because not all AHCI chipsets
support these PM features. It would probably be best to make it
optional: it might slow down drive access, but does certainly save the
environment a little.
