10 in a kernel compile exhibiting audio skips.
Anyway, the "Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = -263211549 ns)" line
in the dmesg I attached to the previous mail confirms IMHO that my
TSC is too unstable for scheduling purpose.
15 minutes after booting, including a kernel compile halted on the
first audio skip, I have this in
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/stats/trans_table
   From  :    To
         :   1995000   1596000   1330000   1064000    798000

Nothing alarming I presume.
Thanks.
