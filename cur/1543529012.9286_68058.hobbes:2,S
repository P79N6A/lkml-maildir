I've updated the user-mode kernel to 2.3.50.
Other developments include:
	eliminated the unexpected SIGIOs that the input thread was getting
	a much improved config and build process, thanks to Peter Moulder
	a readonly option on the block device driver, ditto
	fixed the network driver, which I broke a couple of releases ago during the 
responsiveness fixes
It's also checked into cvs ( 
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=429
 ).
The patch and kernel have been updated and are available from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=429
