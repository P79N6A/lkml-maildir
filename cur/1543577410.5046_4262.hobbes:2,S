You're right that it is more than just a preemptible kernel, but I don't
agree that it's all that huge.  But this is the third time I have worked
on enabling real-time behavior in unix-like OSes, so I may be biased ;-)

But as Roger pointed out, the number of extra context switches
introduced by having a preemptible kernel is actually very low.  If an
interrupt occurs while running in user mode, the context switch it may
cause will happen even in a non-preemptible kernel.  I think that
running a kernel compile for example, the number of context switches per
second caused by kernel preemption is probably between 1% and 10% of the
total context switches per second.  And it's certainly interesting to me
that I can listen to MP3s without interruption now, while doing a kernel
build!
