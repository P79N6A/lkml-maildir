grep Memory /var/log/kern.log
You've got your kernel itself loading into ram, reserved memory, etc.
I've got 48 meg in this test box of mine, and a free -m shows 46, a free shows
47356.  Divided by 1024, gives 46, when rounded off.  So yes, free -m is
correct.  That 251 meg is what's available to use, after your kernel loads,
etc.
