The patch only drops a sysrq that is about to cause a system deadlock. So
if you haven't had any deadlocks this patch shouldn't have a noticeable
affect.
If a caller wants to rely on handle_sysrq, then it should not be called
from interrupt context. handle_sysrq can not defer the work, since the
point of sysrq is to be able get information out when the system is
potentially unusable. How would you know when to defer the work and when
not to?
