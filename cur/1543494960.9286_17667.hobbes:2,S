This was something I wanted to ask about since all the 'mindcraft' stuff
floating around the last few weeks, and the birth of tunelinux.com
Why is it all these kernel constants are not changeable from within the make
proccess?  Why can't all these hard limits be defaulted to their current levels,
and have hard ranges for allowable values in the input fields.
The average admin, even if he/she is working on some heavy usage servers,
shouldn't need to delve into the source tree to tweeks settings for a system
just to compile a tuned kernel.
