The suspend is done from KDE by closing the lid, which runs a trivial 
script. The system seems to suspend normally (correct leds at the end).
When I open the lid again, the system seems to restart (fan starts, leds 
change), but the LCD only shows:
<cursor>      L
System cannot be reached over the net. After some time the fans speed up.
Exactly the same happens if I 'echo mem /sys/power/state' from console 
without X running.
BTW, that partial display is normal for me: I mostly see "Linu" until the 
switch to X.Org, but never a full sentence that makes sense.
*Is* that normal?
