Watch out for ide-ops.c:1262 when using ide-scsi.  ide-scsi does
NOT seem to work when I haven't previously loaded ide-floppy and/or
ide-cd to let me use my drives.  However, once I have done so, it
works for about 4 seconds.  Then it dies.  I can pull the stack trace
and register dump out of my syslog, but I can tell you the EIP is 0010,
the kernel is in interrupt, and it's not tainted.  Experienced with both a
standard 2.4.21 kernel and a 2.4.21-smt (supermount-ng.sf.net patch)
kernel.

	2.4.21
