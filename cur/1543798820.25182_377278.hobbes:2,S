There's a difference between "technically supported by the driver" and 
"officially supported for our costumers":
It's fine if you tell the costumers buying your hardware "anything else 
than 64bit x86_64 kernels is completely unsupported", but for getting 
your driver included into the kernel it should be 32bit clean [1] and 
should also work for people using 32bit kernels on an Opteron.

There's no doubt that this is important for your customers.
What surprises me is that -O3 turned out to be the fastest flag for you.
Can you send numbers comparing -Os/-O2/-O3 (without -g3, preferable with 
gcc 4.0) including a description what and how you are measuring?

[1] not long ago, it used to be the other way round that drivers weren't
    64bit clean...
