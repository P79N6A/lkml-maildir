Yes, but the various patches i've recieved seems to not solve it, it
simply changed the load at which CFS seemed to perform well.
On irc there has been wild speculation as to whether its the
sched_yield() stuff in most 3d drivers, but my tests with stubbing it
out, and altering behavior has not changed anything.

well, as far as my tests show, the only real difference between SD and
CFS in terms of performance, is 3d, where both will deliver basically
the same FPS in a given application, SD does it smooth, which is the
best way to explain it, what happens with CFS, as i experience it, is
that it seems to burstly allocate ressources.

I really think you should try read the SD and RSDL threads on lkml
again, the only place where con havent been extremely fourthcoming was
deep in the thread where Mike was unhappy with SD not giving X more
prioity than fairness dictates..
