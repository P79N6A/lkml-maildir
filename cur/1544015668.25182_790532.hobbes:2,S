Any effort to get m68knommu folded in to m68k proper? This might help
with some of your bitrot issues.. And likely less work to do in
supporting those m68knommu parts that ship with MMUs ;-)
m68knommu is the only one of the mmu/nommu variants left that ships in
its own architecture directory rather than being folded in to its parent.
It would be good to get rid of it one of these days.
