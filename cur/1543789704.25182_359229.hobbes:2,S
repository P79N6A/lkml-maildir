Hi,
I was wondering if someone knew what MADV_FREE is supposed
or intended to do ? I see it sparc* headers. I don't see any
code to implement it or for any other architecture.
./include/asm-sparc64/mman.h:#define MADV_FREE  0x5             
	/* (Solaris) contents can be freed  */
./include/asm-sparc/mman.h:#define MADV_FREE    0x5             
	/* (Solaris) contents can be freed  */
Is this carry over from old days ?
Thanks,
Badari
