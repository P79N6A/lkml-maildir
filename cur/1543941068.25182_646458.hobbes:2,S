Hmmm, I see two cases:
1. I have two mport to two controllers each connected to different
physical fabrics. This system can act as an application bridge between
the two fabrics.
2. I have two mports to two controllers each connected directly or
indirectly to the same fabric. I want to use the extra bandwidth and
load balance and/or have a fall back redundant connection via an
alternate physical connection to the fabric etc.
What should be the rules for allocating the initial IDs to the two
mports to allow system wide enumeration to work in both of the above
cases? 
What do you expect the semantics of higher level addressing to be:
 a pair <mport,id>, where <x,n> is a different device from <y,n>,
 a pair <mport,id>, where <x,n> is the same device as <y,n>,or
 a singleton n, where n is unique and identifies the first routing step
of which controller, x or y, to use.
I smell a can of worms.... :-)
