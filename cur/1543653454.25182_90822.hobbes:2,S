In fact, the problem with my Vaio happens due to the changes
_already_ in 2.4.20pre. I'm now backing them out to try and
isolate the exact changes that caused the problem.
This is exactly the sort of thing I meant. The ACPI stuff is
so fragile a few tiny changes makes a box unbootable.
Merging nearly 3MB of changes at this stage would be lunacy.
Save it for .20pre
