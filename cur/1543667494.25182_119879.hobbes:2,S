Hi,
I'm trying to compile 2.4.0 on an intel machine (850Mhz/400kb Ram/80 Gig 
HD) and am having problems. The error that I'm getting looks something like:
bbootsect.s: Assembler messages:
bbootsect.s: 908: Warning indirect lcall without '*'
ld -m elf_.386 -Ttext 0x0 -s -oformat binary bbootsect.o -o bbootsect
ld: Cannot open binary: No such file or directory
I've already got 2.1.1 up and running on this machine, but haven't been 
able to use the patch, so am recompiling the kernal from the beginning.
Any help would be appreciated.
tia
