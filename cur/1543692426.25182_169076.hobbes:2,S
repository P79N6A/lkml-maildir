Hi Linus.
I read your reply to a person worried about the future of linux. It was a
satisfactory reply; I hope to get a satisfactory reply for this one also.
Can't X be elemenated?
I mean to say kernel level support for graphics device drivers and special
routines for accessing it directly; rest will be done by user space widget
libraries (or say a kernel space light widget library which can be 
customized
by user space libraries).
Why am I asking this?
1st. X is bloat. Though it's good for server environments. For desktop pcs
it's too heavy. On my machine (PIII500 with 128MB RAM) I have to choose from
either to run X or compile 2.6.0-test6.
2nd. It's process based client/server architecture is a bottleneck. It's not
as interactive as is supposed to be.
3rd. Most important. I can't impress or convince my window(crash)(TM) user
friends, relatives (who saw X running on my pc) to use Linux.
4th. I want to see desktop being ruled by Linux.
"Present" is in our hands; we are ruling servers.
You said "Linux, world domination fast".
If my wish is fulfilled, I am sure, one day, You (Mr. Linus) and I will
be saying "Linux, world domination completed".

(Sorry for raising this question during feature freeze. But the
consequences in last few days have forced me to ask this question.)
