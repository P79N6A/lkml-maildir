We're less fortunate than you. We can't even insert the module: we get an
init_module: Device or resource busy.
In fact, our problem is here at qc_detect():
    ostat = stat = parport_read_status(qcam->pport);
    for (i=0; i<250; i++)
    {
        mdelay(1);
        stat = parport_read_status(qcam->pport);
        if (ostat != stat)
        {
            if (++count >= 3) return 1;
            ostat = stat;
        }
    }
it enters the loop, but every time it reads the port it gets the same value
as the previous read, which does not seem to be the expected behavior, so
it finally returns "error".
We're running a 2.2.10 kernel. Is there someone who gets it to run? Could 
you tell us the kernel version you're running?
Any idea, Philip?
Problem is clearly with color quickcam, not parport, etc: we had no problems 
running the BW quickcam.
Many thanks,
Elena & Juan-Mariano.
