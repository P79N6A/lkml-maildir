Grr...  My apologies - I shouldn't have posted before getting some coffee...
The short version of the story:
	* empty rootfs consists of 1 struct superblock, 1 struct dentry and
1 struct inode.  That's less than 1Kb.
	* work with the mount tree is much easier if you know that its root
is always there and always the same.
	* if we start playing with changing the absolute root of mount tree,
we will have to add rather unpleasant code in pivot_root() et.al. and that
extra code will definitely take more than 1Kb.
In other words, it's simply not worth the trouble.  Unlike the situation with
initrd, memory is reclaimed when you do unlink() or rmdir() on rootfs.  So
rm(1) will do nicely...
