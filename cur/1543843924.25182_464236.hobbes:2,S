It is for debug. System administrators and developers also do debug,
they may just use different tools. The percentage of schedule() calls
executed across every Linux box on the planet where debug is enabled is
so close to nil its noise. Even with traces that won't change.

There is an implementation which requires no penalty is paid. Create a
new elf section which contains something like
	[address to whack with int3]
	[or info for jprobes to make better use]
	[name for debug tools to find]
	[line number in source to parse the gcc debug data]
