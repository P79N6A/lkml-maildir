You may try to take the following out of linux/mm/slab.c.
If it helps then this would be a significant evidence that the
bug is sitting there....
        /*
         * Fragmentation resistance on low memory - only use bigger
         * page orders on machines with more than 32MB of memory.
         */
        if (num_physpages > (32 << 20) >> PAGE_SHIFT)
                slab_break_gfp_order = SLAB_BREAK_GFP_ORDER_HI;
        return start;
However this is the only place I'm aware whre the size of mem
matters....
