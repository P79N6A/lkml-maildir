I beieve that what you're trying to do is a little bit more complicated
then simply blocking a few system calls. There are security softwares
doing this but they do more then blindly blocking system calls. Parameters
of the system call do matter in this scenario. For example you don't want
to block every write(), since the application you're trying to control
must be able to write on its own installation dir for example. They do
this by running the given application and "learning" system calls and
params to create a per-application policy. Every behaviour that violates
the policy trigger an event to the user running it (with a
"human readable" description of what is happening) and the user can either
accept it (by trainig the policy) or reject it.
