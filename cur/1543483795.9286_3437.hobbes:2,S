I mean that when i'm using ppp2.2.0+kernel2.0.36, after establishing ppp
connection, command arp -anv  shows me string like that:
ppp.connected.machine   ether :00:34:(mac address of eth0)  MP eth0
But with kenel 2.2.1, in the same situation, arp -anv shows 
ppp.connected.machine  *   *    MP  eth0
so i need to manually add record to arp table.
