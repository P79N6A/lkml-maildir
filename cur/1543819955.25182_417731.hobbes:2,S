Hi folks,
Sometimes my PC dies at boot time:
:
usb 3-3: config 1 has 0 interfaces, different from the descriptor's value: 1
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 000000000000000d RIP:
<ffffffff8809493e>(:usbcore:usb_new_device+350)
:
:
Unfortunately it is not visible in any log file, so I took
a snapshot of the screen.
Surely it would be unacceptable to send huge attachments
to everybody on this list. Is somebody interested? Or is
there some upload area available, that I could use?
