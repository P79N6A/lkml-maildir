Sorry misunderstood your answer with respect to another question.

Ahhhh, in this context, now "I see the light" (actually its dark at the east 
coast).
So you envision this to go through some named "section" or do you
want to go through the futex_region() library call which identifies whether
the code page has been mapped. If not, the kernel then will provide the 
locking code in that page dependent on the architecture (UP or SMP).
Fair enough.

Agreed, my point was wrt providing the functionality only. Only difference 
between UP and SMP would be that a spinning version would default to the 
standard version (no spinning) under UP.

I am no expert in architecture, but if its done through the cache coherency 
mechanism, the overhead shouldn't be 12:1. You simply mark the cache line as 
part of you instruction to avoid a cache line transfer. How can that be 12 
times slower.  .. Ready to be educated....

Yipp, I buy that argument.
Overall, it just seems to me the user locking subsystem is becoming quickly 
again a complicated beast.
Anyway, time to go home and play with the kids :-)
