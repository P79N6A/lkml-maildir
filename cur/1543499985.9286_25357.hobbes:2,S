      a) If Microsoft ends up using Unix, but calling it their own special
	 name and badmouthing the other Unices at the same time, they'll
	 be doing what every other Unix vendor on the planet does.  Who
	 cares?  It still Unix.
      b) Microsoft has a very large programming staff, many of which are
	 fairly sane people.  The temptation to leak the beans and watch
	 the marketeers get pie in their faces may prove to be irresistable.

    On the contrary, it is neither;  the BSD code is released under a
    license that lets people squirrel it away in proprietary code.  It's
    not unethical to do something that you're permitted to do with free
    software, even if you're simply using it as a gun to shoot yourself
    in the foot with.
