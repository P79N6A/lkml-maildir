The problem is that we don't have the hardware that uses tasklets in
critical ways. My original patch series had a debug print in every
function (tasklet_schedule and friends).   I got a few scattered prints on
all my boxes but no flooding of prints. So I can't show that this will
hurt, because on my boxes it does not.

This is my fault to the patch series. I compelety forgot to up the prio.
My next series will include a change where the tasklet work queue will run
at something like prio FIFO 98 (or maybe 99?)
This is a bit embarrassing that I forgot to do this, since I'm a
real-time developer ;-)
