How do I pull a network connection and a terminal out of a hat ?
Where do I get the hat ?

how do I start chvt if I have a locked up console system ?

I didn't do it on purpose to lock up my system and risk FS corruption
durin unclean reboot. I was interested in the server output and " 2>&1 | less"
is the logical way to do that.
I could also "solve" this problem by not running linux. And I can "solve" all
gcc bugs by not using gcc. Those are not solutions. Not to me at least.

My own dumbness ? Did you also say that ping-of-death is not a problem ?
After all it is just the dumbness of people who send out broken ping packets,
no ? And if a computer crashes , businesses lose time and money, you pop up and
explain "no it is not really lost money/time, because it was caused by dumbness !".
