        su "$owner" -c /usr/lib/games/nethack/recover-helper 
The script has worked this way since at least version 3.3.0-7, which is
found in Debian 2.2 (potato).  Is there some other situation you found where
recover would be run as root, other than when explicitly started by root?
This is still a serious bug, of course, and allows gid games to be exploited
to gain the privileges of a user with a recoverable saved game, but not root
(at least not trivially).
