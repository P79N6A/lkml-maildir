Just because they couldn't do it doesn't mean it can't (or shouldn't) be
done.  I knew people who had binaries compiled on VMS V1.x that still ran
on V5 or V6.  We ran V4.4 through V6.0 here and I don't recall *ever*
having to recompile *anything* to keep it working.  I still miss that kind
of stability.

just one more silly change to cope with.
