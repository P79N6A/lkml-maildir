If suspend/resume changes the settings of the card, you need to deal with that
as a separate issue - otherwise resume isn't restoring things properly. Perhaps
you need to prevent module unloading. Just restoring the correct settings when
the driver is loaded is definitely too late.

Why is it too late? There is no need for the driver to set *any* volume levels
on load. When told to load the driver, just LOAD the DRIVER. Don't reset the
card, or make ANY changes.
