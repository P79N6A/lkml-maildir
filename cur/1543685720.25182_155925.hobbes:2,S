DVDs play fine in 2.4.21 but will not play in 2.6.0-test2-mm5 or 
2.6.0-test3. With ogle, this is what spits out:

I tried several DVDs and three gave the above error and one worked but I 
suspect the working one had no copy-protection encoding (low budget 
release unlike the two others: Jeeves & Wooster and Blackadder and Dirty 
Harry).
Unfortunately, I never tested DVD with the other 2.6.0 kernel releases.
