When this saga first started an `ls -l /net/bix' showed a corrupted dentry
for /net/bix/usr.  It was determined that this was SELinux-related.  Fixes were
made and that no longer occurs.
Now, treading on /net/bix/usr/src does not cause bix:/usr/src to be mounted
at /net/bix/usr/src.  Without git-nfs that mount does occur.
The present behaviour is unchanged if /selinux/enforce is set to 0.

Nope.
