Hi Stephen.

No idea re a robust 2.3 version, but I'm using the 2.2 version atm,
and that appears to be rock solid.
The website for it is....
	
http://opensource.captech.com/e2compr
...and, according to that, there is a maintainer, although said
maintainer is apparently not very active "due to university and paid
work". However, that's probably true to an extent of most of us.
I note on the "Current work" page, said maintainer states that the
"real work" is...
 1. Better e2compr support in e2fsck (will take some time, but is
    important).
 2. Maybe find a fix for that blasted Whoops kernel problem.
...but I also note that the said page hasn't been updated since May
9th 1999, so I'm not really sure.
I'd take the job on myself if I was sure I wouldn't be flattening
somebody else's toes...
Best wishes from Riley.
