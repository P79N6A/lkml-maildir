 No, it triggers the BUG_ON() which checks the gfp, not the one
which checks MASK_MIN_SIZE.
 On the other hand I'm not sure whether it does the right thing
(ie, pass size in bytes instead of order) it does:
"""
pg = get_order(size);
[...]
res = dma_alloc_coherent(dev, PAGE_SIZE << pg, dma, gfp_flags);
if (res != NULL)
	inc_snd_pages(pg);
"""
 Maybe it could be changed to:
"""
res = dma_alloc_coherent(dev, size, dma, gfp_flags);
if (res != NULL)
	inc_snd_pages(get_order(size));
"""
 But sound works (simple tests).

 Ok.

 That sounds cool.
