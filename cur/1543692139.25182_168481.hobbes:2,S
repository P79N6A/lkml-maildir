Hi Pete,
> Are you going to submit zfcp and zcrypt and if yes, when?
The zfcp rework is going well but isn't quite finished yet.
It's up to Heiko when he consideres the driver to be in state
for inclusion into 2.6. For the zcrypt driver the news aren't
so good. It very likely won't make it for 2.6.0.
blue skies,
   Martin
