Jack is essentially recommending -unchanging- the behaviour of
sched_getaffinity.  CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU changed it, as an unintended
side affect, and Jack is asking if we should revert that change.
Prior to CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, on (for example) an ia64 SN2, which is
compiled with 512 or 1024 NR_CPUS, the sched_getaffinity call returned
at most the number of CPUs set as were online.
For example, on an 8 CPU SN2 system (compiled NR_CPUS 512) that is at
hand to me right now, compiled without CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, the command:
	strace -etrace=sched_getaffinity taskset -p $$
produces the strace output:
	sched_getaffinity(13282, 128,  { ff, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }) = 128
and produces the taskset output:
	pid 13282's current affinity mask: ff
(why the particular taskset binary I am invoking is compiled
for just 128 CPUs beats me ;).
This is the sort of behaviour that apps might have become to
expect.  And it is not clear that apps would clearly distinguish
between CPUs online at the moment, and possibly online after
some future hotplug event.  Given the paucity of hotpluggable
CPUs, it is a safe bet most apps doing this have not clearly
distinguished these two cases.
Now when we introduce CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, as Jack reports, this
set_getaffinity call is returning with all bits set (Jack was
apparently using a sched_getaffinity call from an app compiled
for 1024 CPUs, on a 512 NR_CPUS kernel):
	(from strace on a 2 cpu system with NR_CPUS = 512)
	sched_getaffinity(0, 1024,  { ffffffffffffffff, ffffff ...
This will break code that thinks this return means that there are
actually available, right now, all those CPUs.
The addition of CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU has changed the apparent (what
-seems- to be happening) behaviour of sched_getaffinity.  Without
it, on a small system running a big NR_CPUS kernel, just a small
number of bits were set.  With it, all the bits are set.
We need to choose, with the advent of hotplug, whether the
sched_getaffinity means:
 1) at most, the CPUs online now, or
 2) at most, all possible online CPUs.
This choice did not exist before.  I recommend choosing the way that
will be the "least surprising" to existing code.  I believe that this
would be (1) the CPUs online now, as Jack's patch accomplishes.
We should not stumble blindly into changing the behaviour of a system
call in an effort to seem to avoid changing it.
