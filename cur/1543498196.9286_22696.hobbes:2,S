You would hand back the old device if it was an old device id and that is
what is on disk (and for most cases it is what should be on disk so you can
use older kernels too).
NFSv2 doesn't interpret major/minor pairs. NFSv3 allows you to ask about
the split. So NFSv2 will preserve the 32bit value given, NFSv3 will shift
it about.

That is another way of handling back compatibility for old 2.0/2.2 boxes.
