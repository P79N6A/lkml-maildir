I was afraid of this :/.
I did some quick tests, and I got non-significant results. I tried building a 
kernel with different make -j parameters, and there was like a few seconds of 
difference, and not always in favour of the same version.
I find it strange that you get such horrible results...
Maybe I was completely wrong with my assumption that one running process 
always has an impact of 1, which would have make the scheduler underestimate 
the load on one cpu and put too many processes on it, without moving them 
afterward.
