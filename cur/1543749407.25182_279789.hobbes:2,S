Rats, I'd hoped you'd have time to do a more thorough review.  Here's
some more comments:
Don't define your own names for standard PCI config space -- use the
ones in linux/pci.h instead.  This whole section should be deleted:
+/*
+ * PCI Configuration Space Register Address Map, use offset from IOC4 PCI
+ * configuration base such that this can be used for multiple IOC4s
+ */
+#define IOC4_PCI_SCR	   0x4	/* Status/Command */
+#define IOC4_PCI_REV	   0x8	/* Revision */
+#define IOC4_PCI_LAT	   0xC	/* Latency Timer */
+#define IOC4_PCI_BAR0	   0x10	/* IOC4 base address 0 */
+#define IOC4_PCI_SIDV	   0x2c	/* Subsys ID and vendor */
+#define IOC4_PCI_CAP	   0x34	/* Capability pointer */
+#define IOC4_PCI_LATGNTINT 0x3c	/* Max_lat, min_gnt, int_pin, int_line */
Calling a pci_dev a "pci_handle" is confusing; most code uses "pdev".
+	pci_read_config_dword(pci_handle, IOC4_PCI_SCR, &tmp);
+	pci_write_config_dword(pci_handle, IOC4_PCI_SCR,
+			       tmp | PCI_COMMAND_MASTER |
+			       PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY |
+			       PCI_COMMAND_PARITY | PCI_COMMAND_SERR);
You call pci_set_master() before this which takes care of PCI_COMMAND_MASTER.
You also call pci_enable_device() which calls pcibios_enable_device()
which ensures PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY is set if it needs to be.
So the code above should be:
	pci_read_config_dword(pdev, PCI_COMMAND, &cmd);
	pci_write_config_dword(pdev, PCI_COMMAND, cmd | \
			PCI_COMMAND_PARITY | PCI_COMMAND_SERR);
Personally, I believe we should be setting PCI_COMMAND_PARITY and
PCI_COMMAND_SERR on all devices by default in pcibios_enable_device,
if not in pci_enable_device().  But we don't, so it's fine to do it
in your driver for the moment.
You don't need the:
+	if (!ia64_platform_is("sn2"))
+		return -ENODEV;
since this code will only ever be called if someone has an ioc4 in
their system.  If it's not an sn2, something's very strange ;-)
+struct pci_driver ioc4_s_driver = {
+      name	:"IOC4 Serial",
+      id_table	:ioc4_s_id_table,
+      probe	:ioc4_attach,
+};
please use C99 initialisers instead
+    {PCI_VENDOR_ID_SGI, PCI_DEVICE_ID_SGI_IOC4, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0,0,0},
you don't need the trailing zeroes
I don't see why you need valid_icount_path().  Everywhere it's called,
you seem to have been handed an ioc4_port back by the kernel core.
Are you just checking for data corruption elsewhere, or is this masking
a bug elsewhere in the driver?

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
