But replacing the flawed KS list with one based on actual contributors,
from the git logs as I proposed last week, doesn't seem silly.
Right now it looks like we have a list of sane candidates up, which I
certainly would be willing to vote for. However, it would be a shame
that the credibility of the election is lost because of sticking to an
undemocratic voting procedure. A procedure which it in fact was stated
when the board was created last year, would be replaced this year.
So, yes, I support Willy's motion of having it moved away from KS. I am
less excited about SPI, but even that would be better than KS.
