Bnejamin hello.
My name is raz and i have encountered a problem with  io_submit.
The maximum duration of a single io_submit operation when
heavily stressing the system with large number of big (1MB) ios,
reaches several hundereds ms.
I have been profiling it and it seems that the problem is the
file->f_op->aio_read operation,
a call that is made in fs/aio.c when coming from:
 sys_io_submit -->
   io_submit_one -->
	  aio_run_iocb -->
   		 *retry
The test is initiating several hundered 1MB IOs over a single block device.
I understand that the assumption made was aio_read is asynchronous and no
delay will occure, but isn't possible to do it in the workqueue context ?
would appreciate your help.
thank you
raz
