That's true. I guess it could be abstracted in a library, but doing
it all in kernel is indeed nicer.
Ok in theory you could go fancy and put the library into the vDSO
which runs in ring 3. Then it would be tied to the kernel again.

I guess some other users would prefer higher performance, but yes
there are probably both types. I don't know what is more important.

With Out-of-order CPUs exact global metrics are pretty difficult.
At which point of the instruction execution would you measure? 
Anyways if RDTSC doesn't work the only global alternatives are much slower
(like southbridge timers) or very inaccurate (jiffies) 
I would just drop it since it'll likely always be somewhat misleading.
