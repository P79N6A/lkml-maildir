That doesn't mean the using OO in a stronger sense than what Linux
and BSD variants is bogus.

On the topic of File Systems, The BeOS (BFS) file system is highly underrated
and has per file attribute association, Journaling.
The BeOS will even bypass the buffer cache for streaming media applications
to prevent needlessly flushing buffer cache.
It would be cool to see these ideas in Linux.

Except when you do a classic Unix linear search of a file system in a directory
with buttloads of entries, then moving to a stronger algorthym like B-trees is
important. That requires a shift away from the quick and dirty stuff that
Unix is known for...
