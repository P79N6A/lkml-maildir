I have not seen this reported yet, so I thought I would point it out.  (I have 
not tested 2.2.5 yet, so I am not certain if it has been fixed.)
Compiling a monolithic kernel and saying "No" to NFS, it still asks if you 
want to emulate a Sun server.  (I guess it wants to know if your non-support 
of NFS will be done in a Sun-like manner I guess.)
Another thing to add to the list...
