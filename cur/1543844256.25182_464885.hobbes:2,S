Are there ever any issues with out-of-order writes from the posting
buffer on supported architectures?  I can (barely) imagine a device
that has the register with the start bit lower in the register address
space than the count/address registers.  Out-of-order writes from
the cache/non-fifo/posting buffer (maybe to assemble a burst) could
make the occasional mess.
Just wondering,
Bill
