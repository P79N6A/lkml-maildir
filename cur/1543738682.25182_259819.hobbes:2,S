Subject: [patch 1/1] uml: fix critical IP checksum corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Lars Ellenberg <Lars.Ellenberg@linbit.com>
Add a memory barrier to the assembly checksum code - the code was copied
straight from the i386 one, and the patch resyncs the code with the original.
I'll check if the original code can be included directly (i.e. "#include")
after 2.6.9.
Without this patch, every 2.6 UML release corrupts the checksum of every UDP
fragmented packet with size >= MTU (verified by various people, we all agree
on this issue; nobody reported "Works fine here"). The corrupted packets are
not accepted, thus blocking any kind of communication with large-sized UDP
packets.
In fact, I've even dissected the UML -> host traffic before and after this
patch with Ethereal - and it always reported an incorrect checksum for
fragmented UDP packets before and always correct after applying the patch.
