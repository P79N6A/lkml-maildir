(Actually it would be nice to say

Kconfig can do that. ("select statement"). If we have one such ifdef,
it is okay, but if it would be more of them.

Agreed about separate patch series.

Can you put big bold comment there?
Why is it needed? Freezer never freezes _current_ task.

That is no longer true after this patch... Ugly ifdef above makes sure
freezer is there for kprobes. I'm trying to say that #if above is
