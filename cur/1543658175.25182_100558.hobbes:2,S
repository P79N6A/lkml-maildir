i can tell you that you're mistaken in your belief.

you seem to miss the basic fact that iSCSI is a block-layer 
transport.  file system != block layer.
supporting any filesystem with iSCSI is trivial - its just the same as 
supporting any filesystem on any other block device.

we certainly don't care about any "certifications" you have for NetBSD or 
solaris.
if you wish to discuss the various merits of parts of the iSCSI protocol, 
there are forums for that kind of thing.
linux-kernel is not one of them.
