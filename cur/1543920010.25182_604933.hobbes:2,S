At first glance, your backport looks clean. I have one comment however,
about the author and version. Since it's a backport from an existing
driver and not one you wrote yourself (eventhough you did the backporting
work), the MODULE_AUTHOR should not be changed (but I think you can add
yourself to it after a comma). The version should reflect the version you
derived it from, at least for bug tracking purposes.
Also, while I understand you would be very glad to get your work merged
(we all once had our first piece of code), I'd like to mention that you
seem to be the only user of this hardware under 2.4 (since it is currently
not supported). I'm not sure it's very reasonable to merge a driver in 2.4
right now for just one user. Even more, I understand that you finally moved
to other hardware, so my feeling is that you did this work as an exercice
(which was cleanly performed, BTW), but that it will not get any real use
in 2.4.
Since 2.4 is moving very slowly, there should be no problem applying
this patch to any version if you really need to use it. Maybe it would
even work with your 2.4 enterprise kernel.
Note that I'm not radically opposed to merge support for new drivers.
If you provide us with really good arguments for a merge, maybe I'll
change my opinion, but I doubt about it, since the only users of this
device must currently be running 2.6.
Thanks,
Willy
