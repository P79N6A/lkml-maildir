Yes, I'll do those tests tonight.

And in case anyone is wondering, yes I did run memtest86 all night
on that machine with zero errors for all tests.
Question for the list.  Have the few folks out there still using dialup
ever seen the following problem with pppd and 2.6.x?
Occasionally, perhaps once every couple of hours of dialup connection 
time,
the data flow from pppd comes to a halt, and messages reporting
"too much work for irq10" appear in dmesg at that time.  Using the kppp 
2.4.2
GUI to exit leaves pppd still running.  Killing pppd works, and pppd 
can be
restarted normally. These failures never occurred with 2.4.x.
