I always liked bk, but will not upgrade to a commercial license.
So bk-kbuild and bk-kconfig will soon dismiss.

It will to some respect depend on the nature of the patches that one
want to have included. Working with a set a patches that change often
will call for a quilt based solution. Working with a fairly stable set
of patches will most likely call for a cogito/git solution.
I will await and see what Greg KH or others come up with.
