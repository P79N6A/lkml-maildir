   I've not seen the problem on unmodified 2.2.18. The 2.2.17/18 VM does have
   its problems but not these. 2.2.19pre3 and higher have the Andrea VM fixes which
   have worked wonders for everyone so far. 
Note that this only shows up when using mke2fs to create very large
filesystems, and you have relatively little memory.  In this particular
case, for example, we saw it with a system that had "only" 256 megs of
memory, and creating a 72 gigabyte filesystem using a 8x9gb RAID
configuration.
Some folks at IBM (in the Mylex controller group) have found this
problem with 2.2.16, 2.2.18, and with some 2.2.19pre patch (they didn't
say exactly which level of the 2.2.19pre patch they were dealing with).
Some folks claiming that the problem exists under 2.2.18, and we've seen
it with our kernel, which is a 2.2.18 plus some set of 2.2.19pre*
patches.
The problem is that mke2fs issues a *lot* of writes when it is writing
the inode table, and apparently the write throttling isn't completely
working write under those circumstances.  There is a workaround which
easily fixes the problem; if you set the MKE2FS_SYNC environment
variable to some value such as 5 or 10, then after writing every 5 or 10
block groups's worth of inode tables, mke2fs will call sync().  This
workaround did fix IBM's problem, which lends credence to the theory
that the problem is a VM bug related to a lack of sufficient write
throttling.  
I've in the past considered making MKE2FS_SYNC=10 be the default, but
Stephen has requested that I not do this, since it's the best way of
showing off this particular VM bug.
