First of all, permission to remove object have _NOTHING_ with permission
to modify it. On any UNIX. You are modifying directory, so you need the
write permissions on _it_. Object is garbage-collected once all links are
gone and nobody keeps it open anymore.

	No, it would not. chmod -w on a directory containing symlink will
do the thing. Again, files/symlinks/subdirectories are not contained in a
directory. They are referenced from there. unlink() removes a reference,
not an object. So write permissions on object are irrelevant - it's a
directory you are modifying.
