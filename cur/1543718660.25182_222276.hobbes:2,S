Ah ok, I see the confusion! ext3 does nothing clever with barriers, it
just uses it for data integrity. A journalled fs is normally not safe to
run on write back cached drives if they aren't battery backed. You could
try reiser instead, it's has a more intelligent use of barriers.

It just looks odd that eg reads vary as much as they do, and that -o
barrier=1 makes -W0 reads faster (and faster then -W1 even). remove
looks reasonable for -W1, but -W0 is still faster. That is _really_ odd.
