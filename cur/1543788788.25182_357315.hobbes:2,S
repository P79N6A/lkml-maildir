Maybe stopping gracefully, warn about what happened, and let the system
keep going. You may be right about your main filesystem, but in the case
I'm running, for example, my system in an ext3 filesystem, and have a
vfat from a usb key. Should my system really hang because I'm not able
to read/write to the device?
