Crap, I have interestingly enough never had reports of a mouse which
generates fast wheel movement in that manner, this makes things a bit
more, er, interesting.
Is this for exps2 or imps2?

We can deal with one half of this, by acting like the a4tech mice when
emulating the exps2 protocol, as far as when reading from them in PS/2
mode....
On the bright side, USB mice are fucked up in new and interesting ways!
(Have a patch for dealing with this A4Tech mouse's second wheel when it
is attached as a USB device, but until mousedev.c knows what to do with
information about the second wheel...)
