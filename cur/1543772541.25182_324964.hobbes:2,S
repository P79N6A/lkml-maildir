Herbert, I perfectly agree with this check and it's consistent with what I
observe. But as you know, there's a difference between resetting a session
and sending an RST to say that we refuse a segment. This check does not kill
the session, it sends an RST whose SEQ is equal to the SYN-ACK's ACK. It's
possible you though the "reset_and_undo" label was used to kill the session,
but it's not the case (although the naming is not clear). So if the remote
end was the one which sent the SYN-ACK, it will clear its session. If it has
been spoofed, it will ignore the RST because in turn, the SEQ will not be
within its window.
Try it by yourself if you don't believe me. I've done lots of tests with
hping2 and I've never managed to kill a session with both a SEQ and ACK
outside the windows.
Regards,
Willy
