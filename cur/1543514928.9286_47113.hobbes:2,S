Concur, all round. However, we've now had 'vfork() == fork()' being generally
advertised for some time. I know programmers, therefore (many of whom I'd not
care to share an office with, but that's another thing entirely) who
reflexively have used vfork() everywhere 'because it's the same as fork, but
might be better than fork one day'.
Post _big_ warnings. Some things will break. Things that should have been
written differently to begin with, mind you.
