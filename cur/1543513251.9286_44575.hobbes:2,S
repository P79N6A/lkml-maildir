Hmm, yes, that isnt currently supported.
On the other hand, this is very close to what add_partition
and del_partition currently do, so a resize_partition
would be easy enough (patch below, entirely untested of course).
If you want to be able to shrink a mounted partition then that
seems tricky - we have to collect from the rest of the kernel
how much is being used as swap, or how large the currently
mounted filesystem is. On the other hand, if you only want to
grow a partition, there is no problem.
