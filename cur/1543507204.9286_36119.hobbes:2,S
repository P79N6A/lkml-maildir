Yep. I've found it. You're probably hitting the second such test in
dcache.c:d_invalidate():
        /*
         * Somebody else still using it?
         *
         * If it's a directory, we can't drop it
         * for fear of somebody re-populating it
         * with children (even though dropping it
         * would make it unreachable from the root,
         * we might still populate it if it was a
         * working directory or similar).
         */
        if (dentry->d_count > 1) {
                if (dentry->d_inode && S_ISDIR(dentry->d_inode->i_mode))
                        return -EBUSY;
        }
This one's harder to get rid of...
Cheers,
