Exactly. Something that _never_ happens in real life.

No. Your scheduler dirties the cache much more than the standard one, so it
will blow out much more of the application (and get blown out of cache more
too). Most probably just one cache miss kills all your advantage (if there
is one at all, Larry has said that a 3% difference could be due just to
random factors).
Sure, pure swichting time is a nice number to quote, but it has no
significance for real life.
