What if do_SAK did something like this?
copy the tty struct to new_tty
NULL out the file list in new_tty
insert new_tty into the array tracking tty minors so that open will
find the new one
in old_tty stub out all of it's routines that do read/write/etc
Now start a kernel thread doing the HUP/INT/KILL sequence, it has a
reference to old_tty so it can find everything.
When everything is clean, delete old_tty
The processes and file handles attached to old_tty won't be able to do
anything, all of their IO calls have been stubbed out. The file list
can't be changed since there there is no way to get to it anymore.
When init respawns it picks up new_tty which is guaranteed clean of
processes and open handles because it was just created.
