Exactly, so it is wrong -- you can't implement that behaviour with
load + cmpxchg.

Not if cmpxchg sees the same value, it won't fail, regardless of how
many writes have hit that memory address.

This was not the big problem -- as I said, if this was the only problem
we could opt for a "watered down" version that doesn't actually load
locked [the ll/sc interface would be much cooler than cmpxchg, IMO :)]
The main problem is the restrictions between the ll and sc. This is why
I implemented atomic_cmpxchg rather than atomic_ll/sc. However I agree
that in critical code, a higher level API should be used instead (eg.
see atomic_add_unless, which can be implemented optimally on RISCs).
