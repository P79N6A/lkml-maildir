Thanks for the info. Yes, this is what I am seeing a lot on linux user 
lists... "Don't use kernel 2.6.8.1 - it is broken" and so forth. Which is why 
I was looking to gain some insight into the k3b problem so I feel I know a 
little about the subject when on the lists... And also like to do testing 
when I can to help... what little help it might be.
thanks,
tim
