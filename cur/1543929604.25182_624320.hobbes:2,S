It isn't the implementation that is flawed, it is the idea.  The entire 
point of a change control system is that you explicitly define change 
sets and add comments to the set.  The filesystem was designed to allow 
changes to be made willy-nilly.  If your goal is to perform change 
control only with filesystem semantics, then you have a non starter as 
their goals are opposing.  Requiring an explicit command command is 
hardly burdensome, and otherwise, a git tree is perfectly transparent to 
non git aware tools.

It isn't missing a client manager, it was explicitly designed to not 
have one, at least not as a distinct entity from a server, because it 
does not use a client/server architecture.  This is very much by design, 
not a work around.
What transparency are you requiring here?  You can transparently read 
your git tree with all non git aware tools, what other meaning of 
transparency is there?

Any talk of client or server makes no sense since git does not use a 
client/server model.  If you wish to use a centralized repository, then 
git can be set up to transparently push/pull to/from said repository if 
you wish via hooks or cron jobs.
