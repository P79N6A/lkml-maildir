Try the attached patch, as a workaround.
Not really sure what is happening, but it seems like win98se isn't
updating the filesize immediately (?).
After truncating the file to 0 bytes the server still returns the old size
(516) when asked (smb_proc_getattr). Somewhere that causes something to
keep the pages for the file (smb_revalidate?) or simply be confused on the
length of the file (508).
I don't understand how as vmtruncate should have thrown out the old stuff
already ... maybe the same page is reused and the last bytes (that
shouldn't be in the file) remain from the last write.
It works with NT4 and Samba, they both return the expected 0 bytes after
truncating to 0. refresh = 0 will not ask and instead run with the 0 byte
length that vmtruncate has set.
