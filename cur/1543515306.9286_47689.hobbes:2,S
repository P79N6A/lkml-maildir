Where should I go, or who should I ask in getting support
for the ATI Rage Fury video card? XF86Setup does not list
any compatible card in the Video Card section, and just
hangs if I try to select any other video card. The Rage Fury
is compatible with the XPert-128, but that card isn't listed, either.
ATI's website (www.atitech.com) only offers support for
Windows 9x and Windows NT - no Unix of any kind.

P.S. Support for the ATI TV-Wonder card would be great too!
