-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Hans Verkuil <hverkuil@xs4all.nl>
V4L: msp_attach must return 0 if no msp3400 was found.
Returning -1 causes the probe to stop, but it should just continue
instead. This patch fixes an annoying 'i2c_adapter i2c-7: Client
creation failed at 0x44 (-1)' kernel message that appeared in 2.6.20
(cherry picked from commit 3284b4e077cb2322754ea7455b8f8af7ce3777b8)
