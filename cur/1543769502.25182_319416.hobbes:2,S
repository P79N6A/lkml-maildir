Sorry, I must have missed it, I try to keep up on all mail associated to
Ingo's RT kernel. Including Ingo on the list is the right thing to do.

This is a check that we have to flag when a RT task calls yield.  This
in itself may not really be a bug, but it can be. There's places in the
kernel that call yield to wait for a bit to clear or a lock to become
unlock (doesn't grab it directly to prevent deadlocking).  This may be
OK with non RT tasks, since other tasks will get a chance to run. But
with RT tasks, a yield won't yield to any task with less priority than
the RT task. So if the RT task is yielding to let a lower priority task
do something it needs, it will in effect deadlock the system for all
tasks lower in priority than itself.

I'll take a look into it.
Ingo,
Did you get my patch to fix the kstop_machine yielding problem?
