Hey,
I know I have seen my kernel outputting "A renamed to B". Since you two 
however wanted that information in the first place, I grepped a bit 
around, and actually found, (drumroll), that the SUSE kernel has had a 
proper patch for [I can't remember how long] quite some time. (At least 
one distro which does the right thing.) I copied it below.

Subject: [PATCH] keep track of network interface renaming
From: Olaf Hering <olh@suse.de>
Keep track about which network interface names were renamed after the
network device driver printed its banner. Example insanity:
honeydew:~ # dmesg| grep -Ew '(eth[0-9]|rename|renamed)'
e1000: eth0: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
e1000: eth1: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
e1000: eth2: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
e1000: eth3: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth3' to 'eth0'
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth3' to 'ethxx3'
eth3 renamed to ethxx3
dev_change_name: about to rename 'ethxx3' to 'eth0'
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth0' to 'eth3'
eth0 renamed to eth3
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth1' to 'eth2'
dev_change_name: about to rename 'eth1' to 'ethxx1'

ethxx3 renamed to eth0
dev_change_name: about to rename 'ethxx1' to 'eth2'
ethxx1 renamed to eth2
