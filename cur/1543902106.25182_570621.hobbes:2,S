Of course. UML (and s390) doesn't have (a need for) I/O memory because it uses
paravirtualization for all drivers.
M68k uses I/O memory for all I/O (hence it sets CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM), but
many m68k machines don't have PCI or ISA (hence it doesn't set
CONFIG_PCI resp. CONFIG_ISA).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
