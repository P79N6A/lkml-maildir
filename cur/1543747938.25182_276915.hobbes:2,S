To me it seems more correct that a request to read the partition table
should fail if the partition table can't be read.  I had some code
that did care to know the difference, but if you really want to roll
it back I won't object.
fdisk, cfdisk and parted all just give a warning in this case.  You
can tell sfdisk to ignore the error with --no-reread.
