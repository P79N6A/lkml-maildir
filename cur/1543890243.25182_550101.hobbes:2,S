Subject: [PATCH] ISDN4Linux: fix maturity label (v4)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/28/219

Seeing that the discussion about this has ebbed out but the last version
of this patch has disappeared again from the -mm tree, permit me another
attempt to get this fixed:
From: Tilman Schmidt <tilman@imap.cc>
According to the definitions recently posted on LKML, the maturity label
for the ISDN4Linux subsystem is wrong. This patch corrects it and also
clarifies the accompanying help text a bit.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.
In practice, there is.
