Nope. Address doesn't work for me.

Yeah, I had thought about this. What I was thinking was that, on panic, the 
kernel could either kill the graphics mode entirely or do something like what 
the Amiga used to do - ie: scroll the screeen *down* and insert the error 
output at the top. (well, the opposite, really - scroll up and insert, just 
to keep the code simple and elegant)
Other than that, well... I figure that if the kernel is using DRM internally 
it can easily tell DRM to cancel out all extended rendering contexts - 
OpenGL, overlays and such - when the panic happens.
