The way round it I keep thinking of is to have generic scheme like
{read,write}{b,w,l}_resource(resource * res.int offset,
                             {byte,word,long} *data);
Then indirect through an appropriate function pointer found in the
resource struct. 
But this doesn't half slow down what was once a single memory access. So
I can't see us going this route given Linus' previous comments. 
Good and generic it is yes, but also nice and slow.
