I also suffer from this problem (I'm speaking about heavy InnoDB corruption
here), but with vanilla 2.6.0-test2. I can't blame MySQL/InnoDB because
there are a lot of MySQL boxes around of me with the same (in fact the box
wich failed is replication slave) or allmost the same database setup.
All other boxes (2.4 kernel) works fine up to now.
Sorry but I can't provide additional info. There was no messages in kernel log.
All I have is mysql error logs. But I'm afraid they are not very helpfull
for kernel developers.
