This is useless if you are submitting the patch, especially if you're

The subject notes 3 specific things that are being addressed, but you've
rolled this all in to one patch which makes it utterly impossible to
figure out what you're actually fixing. At the very least, split this in
to 3 different patches, each dealing with one of the things noted in the
subject. The fact that regressions is plural also suggests you may want
to split this down in to smaller patches that deal with specific
regressions if they are not directly related.

Do not invent new sign-off tags, see Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
Scripts do end up having to parse this stuff.
