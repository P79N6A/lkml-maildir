hei
the log at 
http://karlsbakk.net/uptime.log.gz
 is a log create with
while true
do
	uptime >> log
done
this shows the system load is somehow looping?!?
the system behaves well and is in production, but I don't really 
understand what the kernel is up to. same numbers are reported by top. 
sar and top etc reports no or little cpu and I/O load (<3%). The system 
is used as a general tools server doing some webserver, nagios and mrtg 
stuff. System is running 2.6.9-mm1.
please cc: to me as I'm not on the list
