Hi
I don't know if this helps, but I seem to have stumbled onto a
possible "fix" for this...
With 64GB high memory enabled in kernel 2.4.12-ac3, and mtrr turned
on, I was able to see all 8GB RAM on my machine by using the old
'append="mem=8000M"' command in my lilo.conf file... AND WITH NO LOSS
OF PERFORMANCE!
Does that help anyone with defining where this problem is coming from?
BCT
