Agreed, it should be fine.  The default rlimit of zero is just as
effective with the adjust by one semantics.

Yes, if the rlimit is permissive enough.  So, for example with default,
there's no chance for any negative increment.  With rlimit of 1 (or 2
with adjust-by-one) you could nice down to 19, then nice back up to a
max of 18.

Yes, this requires updated pam patch.  Otherwise,
ACK
