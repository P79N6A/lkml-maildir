I believe F90 has a couple of different ways of dynamically allocating
memory.  I'd expect in most implementations the FORTRAN runtime would
translate that into a malloc() call.  However, as I gather, many HPC
apps are written by people who are scientists first and programmers
second, and who still think in F77 where there is no dynamic memory
allocation.  Hence, gigantic arrays in the BSS are common FORTRAN
practice.
