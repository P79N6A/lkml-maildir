I'd like to use that for nic shutdown for natsemi:
    disable_irq();
    shutdown_nic();
    free_irq();
    enable_irq();
The irq handler touches registers that restart the nic. Right now I use 
a np->hands_off variable to avoid that.
But I don't know if all systems can support atomic request_irq/free_irq 
calls. request_irq creates /proc/irq/x/cpu_affinity, and I could imagine 
that on some archs it might have perform IPIs to reconfigure the irq 
controller of a remote node.
