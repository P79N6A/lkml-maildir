Oops, that should have read (n+1) 10ms, or +1 res. But you got the point
anyway ;)

Actually, I just ran your prog on a ia32 -rt kernel, with highres, and
using select, I get return times of less than 5ms. So this looks like a
bug.  On 2.6.17 vanilla, I also got under 5ms. But it might be ok for
select to return early. I'm not sure on this one.  But using nansleep
never returned early on either system.

So you got a big jitter using nanosleep???  If that's the case, could you
post the times you got. I'll also boot a kernel with the latest -rt patch,
without highres compiled, and see if I can reproduce the same on x86.
