I'm trying to make a pair of custom boot/root diskettes (for partimage).
The kernel I have compiled the kernel for bootdisk loads fine, reads the
rootdisk (gzipped image) to the end, and then, it says:
Kernel panic: no init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.
The root disk is good, because I have built a 2.4.9 in a similar
fashion, and it works with it.  The problem is I need NTFS support, and
that doesn't compile in 2.4.9.
