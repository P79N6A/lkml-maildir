This one compiles, boots fine, devmapper seems to be happy again.
But this one freezes after a while like 2.5.70-mm9. And as said,
2.5.70-mm4 is rockstable on this machine.
Yesterday I was clicking around in the konqueror window, when sound
began too loop for a second (not more than two), than there was a pause
of a second, then the desktop freezed, no ping.
MagicSysReq (Alt+Print+P) didn't do it either. So ATM I am trying to get
this serial console thing to work, may be that helps...
Furthermore my kernel is tainted, so I have to change my X config. Then
I am waiting for the next freeze :)
Has there something changed, which may be the nvidia kernel module won't
like after 2.5.70-mm8?
