The build of 2.6.10 vanilla just completed and I reran my tests with
SMP and with MAXCPUS=1 (UP w/ SMP kernel).
The vanilla 2.6.10 kernel has the non RT starvation problem as well
for both test runs. It looks like this is not something in -mm but a
change between 2.4 and 2.6.
I did notice the test results were a little inconsistent between the
two runs...
             2.6.10 SMP    2.6.10 UP (w/ SMP kernel)
disk write    starved          OK
disk copy        OK         starved
disk read     starved       starved
but in both cases, a non nice (non RT) disk application was
starved by a nice (non RT) cpu application for minutes.
I wonder who I should be talking to next (or submit a bug report?)
about this.
