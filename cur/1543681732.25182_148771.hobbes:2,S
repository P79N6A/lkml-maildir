Oh right, sorry.

It is, unfortunately it uses read/write on /dev/sg* directly so cannot
be used with "new path" that is so much faster. It's been a while since
I looked, I can check for a good cdda ripper that uses SG_IO tomorrow if
you don't find one first.
I'm about to cave in and add block emulation of that part, too. It's a
bit more code, though.
