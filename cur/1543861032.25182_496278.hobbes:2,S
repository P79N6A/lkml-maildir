seconded - i have tested the new MMU changes quite extensively and they 
are converging nicely. It brings down context-switch costs by a factor 
of 10 and more, even for microbenchmarks: instead of throwing away the 
full shadow pagetable hiearchy we have worked so hard to construct this 
patchset allows the intelligent caching of shadow pagetables. The effect 
is human-visible as well - the system got visibly snappier.
(I'd increase the shadow cache pool from the current 256 pages to at 
least 1024 pages, but that's a detail.)
