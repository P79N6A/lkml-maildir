Fair enough, I guess.

A few cosmetic and interface things:

hm, that's an unrelated bugfix.

Can we implement these as lower-case-named inline functions?  I don't think
there's any reason why they have to be macros?

That `not_critical_when_idle' is a real mouthful.  Could we just use
"deferrable"?  With a nice comment in a strategic spot which explains what
it's all about?

I'm not sure I really like the idea of modifying a timer's state when
installing it.  Plus mod_timer() is a superset of add_timer(), and people
might want to use mod_timer().
I think it would be better to specify the type of the timer when we're
initialising it, not when we're installing it.
So would it not be nicer to do:
	setup_deferrable_timer(timer, my_handler, my_data);
	add_timer(timer, whenever);
or
	mod_timer(timer, whenever);
?

OK.
