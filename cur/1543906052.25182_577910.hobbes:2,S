Oops, that was the wrong one.  Locking up one was HL-DT-STDVD-RAM
GSA-H30N and it correctly reports that it doesn't support IPM.  Here
are some test results.
Controller is ICH9.
00:1f.2 SATA controller [Class 0106]: Intel Corporation Unknown device [8086:2922] (rev 02)

The device doesn't respond till power is physically removed and
restored.  It seems something in ahci_disable_alpm() path upsets the
device.

And hotplug works fine after EH is done with itself.  Dunno why.

4. Harddisks
All the harddisks I have behave themselves.  Impressive.
====
In all cases, hotplug works well even after ALPM is configured.  Have
no idea why.  It might be that PARTIAL/SLUMBER mode didn't kick in or
ICH9 has some magic feature to detect PHY status changes even in PS
mode (wishful thinking).
Will repeat the test with ICH7 when I get some time.  Anyone up for
testing JMB and VIA?
With some massging to ahci_disable_alpm(), I think it can be fairly
safe on this chipset at least.
