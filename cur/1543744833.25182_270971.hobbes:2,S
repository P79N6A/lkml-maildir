Forced the event ;)

Ok i can do that, weak functions tend to get different reactions from 
different people, so i rarely use them in submitted code.

Hmm, i'm not sure, if the cpu trips the overheating condition the other 
components may not be running within specification either. I think let's 
be cautious and just set the taint bit.

It's not actually an NMI, it's delivered via FIXED delivery mode and is 
maskable. I thought you had some sort of aversion towards using printk 
within that context.

Ok, then i think we need to make the mce logging capable of storing 
extended information, is the code i did for i386 ok with you?
