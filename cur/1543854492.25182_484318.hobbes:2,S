Not found anything relevant, but I keep noticing these lines
in ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv(), ext3 and ext4 similar:
		} else if (grp_goal > 0 &&
				(my_rsv->rsv_end - grp_goal + 1) < *count)
			try_to_extend_reservation(my_rsv, sb,
					*count-my_rsv->rsv_end + grp_goal - 1);
They're wrong, a no-op in most groups, aren't they?  rsv_end is an
absolute block number, whereas grp_goal is group-relative, so the
calculation ought to bring in group_first_block?  Or I'm confused.
(Whereas in my hang the grp_goal to ext2_try_to_allocate was -1
when I looked, with group 0 and num 1.)
