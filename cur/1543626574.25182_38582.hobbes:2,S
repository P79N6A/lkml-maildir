Well Ingo added that ;)
We used to just set a flag in the preempt_count that marked the task as
preempted and made sure on its next trip into schedule it ran again.
Do you think it is better to deny preemption if state==TASK_ZOMBIE (note
this requires code in preempt_schedule and the interrupt return path,
since Ingo decoupled the two) or just disable preemption around critical
regions caused by setting state to TASK_ZOMBIE ?
I suspect this is the first occurrence of a problem of this kind ... and
the attached patch handles it.
