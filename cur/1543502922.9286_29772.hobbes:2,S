sorry to bother this list, but i haven't been able to find an answer
elsewhere.  here's my problem:  i have a linux/alpha box (164lx) with two
scsi adapters in it (NCR 53c875 based).  the AlphaBIOS recognizes the
cards in one order (i.e. #1=SCSI0 and #2=SCSI1) while the linux
kernel/milo recognize them in the oposite order.  why is this a problem?  
this machine is used for classified data processing, so a variety of disks
are/can be attached to it, and depending on whether any disks are hanging
off of one of the controllers, /dev/sda gets remapped, causing problems
booting.
now that i've done a cruddy job of explaining my problem, heres the real
question:  is there something i can pass the kernel to tell it which card
i want to be SCSI0 and which i want to be SCSI1?  or do i have to resort
to devfs to ensure my drives are properly named?
thanks,
-matt
