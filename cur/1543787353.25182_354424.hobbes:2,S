I don't know how things were when you started using linux but linux
has never been about that AFAIK. People usually buys windows
licenses for that ;)

Oh well. May be Christoph and James are behaving like 9-years-old
kids, but if that's true you're NOT BEING DIFFERENT than them if
you look a bit to your mails.
You can be pretty sure that at this stage everyone is looking you as a
9-years-old kid who is raving because his mother don't buy him a
candy. Maybe they're looking james and christoph int he same way
aswell, but that's their issue.
