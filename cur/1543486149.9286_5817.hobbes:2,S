The errors usually appear while mounting the filesystem.
The hard-disk seems to be OK, does anybody know if there is a bug in the
kernel which can corrupt the filesystem. On that harddisk I run a
Proxy-Server which manages many many (sure more than 1000) files and
directories. I tried more than one harddisk and the problem appears when
the Proxy-Cache grows.
Maybe this can be a hint to a hidden bug which doesn't appear often or
affects only large directory-trees.
