I agree that it would be useful to match the full path, but
the patch is broken, as are the owner match's pid-, sid- and
command-matching options. You can't grab files->file_lock
outside of process context. Besides, we want to consolidate
functionality, not add new matches that do basically the same
as existing ones.
