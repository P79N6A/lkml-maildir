Christoph Hellwig sent a patch for this to the linux-scsi
list. Both patches have the same minor problem. Sysfs
store() callbacks are supposed to return the count of
bytes consumed. It's a moot point in this case since there
is no sscanf() processing. To use this code I can get
to the appropriate sysfs directory and write:
   # echo "anything_I_like" > rescan
So are all bytes in that string consumed? If so the "ret = 0;"
line in your patch should be "ret = count;".
