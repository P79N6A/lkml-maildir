This file can definitely use some rewriting, so thanks for doing this
work.  I'm just picking on some things I notice while reading your patch:

If you're going to touch this at all, it should be rewritten so it
actually makes sense.  I would rewrite this sentence as either
    "...the ability to mask/unmask a single MSI while servicing its
     interrupt."
or
    "...the ability to mask/unmask a single MSI while running its
     interrupt service routine."

"device function" (which is PCI jargonese) should probably just be
"device."  Also, perhaps "...a device driver that..." would read
better than "...any existing device driver which...."

"...the conflict..." should probably be "...a conflict..."
