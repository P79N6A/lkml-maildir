I wouldn't have a problem with this, except that you've been deferring
the ACPI merge for over a year. We've been maintaining this patch
outside the mainline tree for EIGHTEEN MONTHS. Please stop leading me
along. Will you EVER merge it?
I am confident it will merge cleanly.
I am confident it will cause no problems when CONFIG_ACPI=off.
I am confident the total number of working machines will go up.
I am willing to bet $500 of MY OWN MONEY on this.
Talk to me, man. What would make you happy? A lot is riding on this.
Regards -- Andy
