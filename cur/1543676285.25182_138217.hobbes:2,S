See the suspend and resume target methods in my recent dev tree.
We'll have to delay the metadata reading for both the snapshots and
mirror to the first 'resume'.

I think removing a device that has deferred io against it should not
be possible, since it can only be in that state if the device is open.
We shouldn't start ripping devices out from under people.
The one place where we do want to do this is for the DM_REMOVE_ALL
ioctl cmd.  Which is really an emergency panic button.  I'll just
error any deferred io in this case.
