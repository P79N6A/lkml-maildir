When floating those ideas, was it clear that an implementation was being 
actively developed?  You could have said something when Greg posted 
version 0.1 of udev back in April.
If people had known that this was in the works, they might have chosen 
to concentrate on this rather than udev. As it is, there has been 
significant effort put into udev, and now there is duplicated 
functionality and more work will be required to figure out how to 
combine them (if that is the chosen path).
