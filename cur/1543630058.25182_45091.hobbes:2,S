I have this dream about how we *should* name things in the
kernel..... but I won't bore you with that just now.
The relevant bit relates to how to map from an open-file-descriptor on
a device (or on a file on a filesystem on a device) to information
about that device.
The only piece of information we can currently get is the device
number (either st_rdev or st_dev).
Using the principle that
   "All API extenstions should be done via special filesystems"
the answer has to be that there is filesystem-like-thing that maps
device numbers to their "True Identity".
e.g.
  /kernel/devno/3/1 ->  /kernel/device/pci/0/00:1f.4/ide/0/0/pc_partition/1
Actually, I would prefer something like:
  /kernel/devno/3/1 -> /kernel/disk/3/part/1
together with
  /kernel/disk/3/bus -> /kernel/ide/0
  /kernel/disk/3/disk   BLOCK:3:0
  /kernel/disk/3/part/1 BLOCK:3:1
  /kernel/disk/3/part/2 BLOCK:3:2
  /kernel/ide/0/disk -> /kernel/disk/3
  /kernel/ide/0/bus  -> /kernel/pci/0/00:1f.4
  /kernel/pci/0/00:1f.4/ide -> /kernel/ide/0
and they would be "devlinks", not "symlinks"... but I think I might be
beginning to bore you.
