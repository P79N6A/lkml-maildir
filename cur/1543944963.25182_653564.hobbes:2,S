Correct.

This is exactly what I suggested (or meant to) *except* that I want it to
only apply to the stable branch.  I intend that the stable branch of
linux-next will never be rebased and so is suitable for others to base
their trees off.  The master branch will be continually rebased as the
subsystem trees change over time.
Originally, I assumed the stable branch would be for our "usual" API
changes, but it appears we are not having any more of those. :-)  However,
I see an argument for attempting to stabilise possible conflicting
changes get Linus' review/ack and add them to the stable branch.
Linus suggested that such changes should go into an independent tree that
everyone could pull into their trees with the full confidence that that
tree would be merged into Linus' tree when the merge window opens.  I am
suggesting that that tree be the stable branch of linux-next.
I know I haven't thought through all the consequences of this, so
discussion is encouaged.
