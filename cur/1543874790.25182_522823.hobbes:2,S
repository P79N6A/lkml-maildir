Sorry for this mess up. you know, as
blackfin-arch-balance-parenthesis-in-macros.patch was posted, it was
applied to our SVN tree. And I just merged these weeks SVN change to
this update patch. So this patch includes
blackfin-arch-balance-parenthesis-in-macros.patch. 
Please hold on, after I fixed some issues according to Arnd and Paul's
latest review, a new update patch will be sent.
Sorry for send a all-in-one update patch. Arnd and Paul gave lots' of
good ideas about our last blackfin-arch.patch last time, and most of
their request are applied in this days. So if I split the all-in-one
update patch to small fix, there will be maybe 20 or 30 patches.
After this blackfin-arch-update.patch was merged to -mm, I will post
small fixed patches as Arnd's advise.
Thanks
