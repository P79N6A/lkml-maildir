Apology to Jeff,
I am sorry to here of this, but I know what you mean about microsoft.
My and co-worker's code for doing full taskfile access under linux was
rejected here but is being used in MicroSoft Whistler 2001.  They are
quick to grab the very best of Linux and adopt it for their own.
Yes when it gets down to it, life is the only thing of value.
Please enjoy yours, and I will offer the first hand to welcome you back
regardless.  I mean that too!!
As you know, I am one of the violently flamed and flaming person on the
list and as a developer.  I will fight at the drop of a hat or not,
regardless.  We had our differences, but that was then.
I am sure that there will be other developers like myself that will NDA
with you to get  "NDS Project/NTFS/M2FS" in to linux and will test with
you on the outside until.
Follow up offline.....
Respectfully,
