Thanks for adding it, just a note that this diff includes a version that
is different from the one I sent (that's no problem for me, you know
more about Voyager than I do).

I'm not sure whether the latter works. My original patch included a
config MCA
       bool
       depends on VOYAGER
instead. This makes it more clear that it is actually what was called
define_bool in the old kconfig (even if it works a "default" entry in a
define_bool sounds really strange).
