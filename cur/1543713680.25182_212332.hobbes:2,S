Recently I've had to change the multiplier in gkrellm to reduce it by 
a div/10 to get the correct reading.  I've no idea how to make 
sensors see the new, multiplied by 10 readings correctly, I cannot 
make it run with later 2.6 kernels.
For gkrellm-2.1.28, the .28 version is needed by later kernels anyway, 
use the default, it apparently already corrects for this with its 
1.000 multiplier.  2.1.24, when it worked, had to have a multiplier 
of 0.1000.
But join the 70C club, that AMD athlon keeps itself at a medium simmer 
full time.  Mine has been running 67-72C for 3 years now.  Strangly, 
shutting down setiathome doesn't cool it by more than a couple 
degrees C.  And, its got a $50 all copper Glaciator cooler on it, 
heavy heavy heavy.
