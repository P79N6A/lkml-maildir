The patch to add the PnP BIOS driver has been updated:
   
http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/pnpbios.html
The "nobiospnp" kernel parameter has been replaced by
"pnpbios=" with the following arguments:
   on           enable driver
   off          disable driver
   [no-]curr    [don't] give access to the "current" config
   [no-]res     [don't] reserve ioports used by system devices
Default is on,curr,res.
Patch is against 2.4.17-rc1, but it should apply to 2.4.16 and
2.4.17 too.
Please let me know right away if you have any problems.
