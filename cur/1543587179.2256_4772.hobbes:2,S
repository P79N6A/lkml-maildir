When this is rewritten, I would strongly suggest that we find a way to
make 'gettimeofday' nearly free.  Certain applications need to use this
frequently while still being portable.  One solution when you do have
clock ticks is a read-only mapped Int.  Another cheap solution is
library assembly that adds a cycle clock delta since last system call to
a 'gettimeofday' value set on every system call return.
