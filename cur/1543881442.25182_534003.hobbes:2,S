Except servers use IPC and need this access control as well. Without IPC 
and network restrictions you can't protect database servers, ldap 
servers, print servers, ssh agents, virus scanning servers, spam 
scanning servers, etc from attackers with knowledge of how to abuse the IPC.

Without a security interface in DBUS similar to SELinux' apparmor won't 
be able to control who can talk to who across DBUS, only who can connect 
to DBUS directly.
