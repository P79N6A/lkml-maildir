Linux today monitors this list.  Some public education may be the best
route.  How do we post a security advisory warning people that will get
posted?  I'm sure folks see the DANGEROUS comments, but they don't seem
to stick in their heads.  Then they get themselves into trouble, and
fortunately for them, I'm around.  I am just concerned about the scope
of the black eye that will just keep getting bigger and bigger for Linux
NTFS.
