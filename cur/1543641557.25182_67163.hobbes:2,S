There have been a couple of bugs fixed in ext3 that _might_ relate to
that, but no recent ones I can think of which are definitely
associated with that sort of sympton.

I'm not sure just what version of the code Mandrake are shipping,
though.  The latest ext3 is almost completely merged into Marcelo's bk

Without ksymoops output for the oops, there's not much else I can do
with this.
