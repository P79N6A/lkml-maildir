I accept this...

I'd agree, that drivers should be made to not screw up when an
unexpected condition arises, where that's possible.  Like, not
crashing the OS if a device returns an unexpected value.
This particular problem (what seems to be an unacknowledged interrupt,
but that could be a symptom of something else) is troublesome and
likely impossible for the driver to detect and handle sanely.  Because
PCI interrupts are shared, and a driver cannot assume that its device
was responsible for any particular interrupt.
I believe that the 2.6 kernel provides a general central mechanism for
detecting and throttling unacknowledged interrupts, if that really is
the problem.  That's where this particular fix belongs, not in the
driver (and every other driver).
