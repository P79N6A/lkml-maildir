I have strange messages in my kernel log (1-2 messages per day)
raid5: bug: stripe->bh_new[2], sector 477640 exists
raid5: bh 8ffd6da0, bh_new 8ffd63e0
raid5: bug: stripe->bh_new[2], sector 6677320 exists
raid5: bh aca1f060, bh_new aca1f720
raid5: bug: stripe->bh_new[1], sector 6854048 exists
raid5: bh b94c02c0, bh_new b94c0260
raid5: bug: stripe->bh_new[2], sector 6889584 exists
raid5: bh 833949c0, bh_new 83394d80
What does it mean? Can this cause data corruption? Can i fix this problem?
I use softvare RAID level 5, in kernel 2.2.16 with RH patches.
Or tell me, who mantain software raid code, and may help me solve this
problem.
Also I have second question. 
	How much stable software RAID in latset 2.4.0 test series?
