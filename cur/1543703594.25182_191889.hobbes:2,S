Long ago we had a thread here with approximately the above subject.
I see fragments of discussion like
- if (drive->media == ide_cdrom)
+ if (drive->media == ide_cdrom || drive->media == ide_optical)
                         (void) request_module("ide-cd");

and still today, by default ide_optical is sent to ide-cd.
I wonder whether that is meaningful.
By some coincidence I got hold of an MO drive today. Under 2.4.21
and 2.6.1 using ide-scsi all seems to work at first sight.
With ide-cd I get errors only.
Not surprising: ide-cd expects a CD so sends READ_TOC and
gets "illegal request / invalid command" back.
The appropriate command is READ CAPACITY.
Are there cases where ide-cd is useful?
Should we retarget ide_optical to ide-scsi?
