I had a sudden surge of inspiration and decided to follow up on this
one a bit:

I have now found a very hacky workaround that is slightly better than
disabling C3 altogether; making C3 exclusive to one core at a time. It
seems to kill the noise and the system now spends 50% in C3, instead of
0%.
I read somewhere that the Intel Duo:s have an extra low power mode that
is entered if both cores are suspended at the same time (disabling the
shared cache or something like that I guess). So perhaps that mode is
the culprit. I'm hoping there's a way to disable just that feature. Do
any of you know a way? Venkatesh perhaps?
Here's the patch I'm currently running at least:
