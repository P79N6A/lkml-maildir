In my personal opinion I'd say compiling the kernel with pgcc is rarely if
ever going to make it faster (for the reasons you state).
However I would be interested in comparisons for the kernel on the k6,
specially between a pgcc snapshot and pgcc-2.95.1.
pgcc-2.95.1 uses the k6 support that comes with gcc, the original amdk6
support in pgcc was thrown away.
Unfortunately, people claimed that this slowed everything down (with
-mk6), and it would be interesting to be able to measure this on the
kernel (maybe using lmbench).
