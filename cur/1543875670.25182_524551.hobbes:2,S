I don't think this is correct, at least in theory.
Suppose that
	tvec_base_t *prelock_base = timer->base;
	base = timer_get_base(timer);
are re-ordered (the second LOAD happens after the first one), and the timer
changes its base in between. Now, we lock the old base, and return it because
"prelock_base == timer->base" == true.
