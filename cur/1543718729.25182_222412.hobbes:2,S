The kernel RPMs I do (
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.6/
) pretty much
will have it always for 2.6. Not just for large memory configs, but
because several userspace applications (databases, java etc) really like
that extra Gb of virtual space too. 
As for the cost; 4:4 split seems to be hardly expensive at all, only in
some microbenchmarks.
