I announce the ext2 filesystem repairing utility, e2salvage.
e2salvage is a utility which tries to recover a data from damaged ext2
filesystems. Unlike e2fsck, it does not look for the data at particular
places and it don't tend to believe the data it finds; thus  it can handle
much more damaged filesystem. Moreover, fsck connects the found i-nodes to
lost+found directory. e2salvage instead tries to recover the directory
structure.
You can download the package at
