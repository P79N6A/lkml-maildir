You are building AGP as a module with DRM as a built-in ,the DRM
cannot use the AGP if it is not built in also, I think the latest DRM
bk tree should enforce this I'm not sure if -mm5 has  the patches in
it or not...
I'm going to add something in the DRM debug to state whether AGP is in
use or not ..
Dave.
