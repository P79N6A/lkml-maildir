But the userlevel tool needs fixed too.  Recompiling is fine, as long as
it is easy to configure, a config file might be nice also.
I know devfsd is nice and good, but I don't use it.  At this point I have
ALL my programs working without it.

How about releasing a new version of the userlevel tools.  Just list it as
the required version in the Changes file.  Have the new version check to
see if /dev/lvm is a directory or file.  It probally isn't the best idea
to assume too much based on that fact, but it could be used as a basis for
devfs vs. traditional /dev compatibility in one executable without needing
a recompile.

We just required a modutils upgrade.  No one really complained.  A few
people (not many at all) cried about things breaking.  But a quick pointer
to the Changes file set them straight.  So yes, do this now.
