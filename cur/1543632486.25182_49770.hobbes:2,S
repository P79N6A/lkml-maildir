Don't all those atomic volatile bitops slow down a hotpath for no real
gain?  I'm all for clearing all possible flag bits at that point, but
would prefer just one mask myself.  But given all the preceding tests,
and the ClearPageDirty, perhaps I'm foolish to question your additions.
And wasn't it originally clearing the referenced bit, now leaving it?
