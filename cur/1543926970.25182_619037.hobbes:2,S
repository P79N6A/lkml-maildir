Subject: [PATCH] Fix segfault when printing battery status

cat /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0A08:00/device:19/PNP0C0A:00/power_supply/BAT1/status
This leads to a stacktrace as acpi_battery_get_property() returns 0 for a 
case where it does not set val->intval. These value is used as an array 
index in drivers/power/power_supply_sysfs.c::power_supply_show_property(). 
I had a situation where the value was 4096 which caused a problem as the 
array only has 5 entries.
