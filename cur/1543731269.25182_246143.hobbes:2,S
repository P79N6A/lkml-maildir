  No, not really. This is a user decision and should be options in the
  backup  software.  I don't think it is up to the kernel, filesystem,
  or  the  OS  in  general to decide what information the user want to
  retain or not.

  The  archivers  should,  as  I  said,  allow  the user to choose. It
  shouldn't be automatic. Default, should IMO be to store everything.
