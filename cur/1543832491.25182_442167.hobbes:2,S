Bcm43xx has no helper application to upload the firmware. This is done 
in the driver. It's RAM based hardware without a Flash-ROM. The driver 
has to upload the firmware in the init phase after each reset.
The driver gets a firmware file from /lib/firmware/ without knowing 
which version this is. It's not possible to say enable this in the 
driver if you find a firmware x and disable that if it's only version 
y. That was my motivation to start thinking about firmware versioning.
But in the meantime I think it's a security issue, too. A driver 
should only accept firmware files with certified checksums. I guess it 
would be really difficult to enter a machine by firmware hijacking. So, 
I'm still in hope that this is only a paranoia on my side. But it's 
worth to think about it.
