Just an information for you to compare, now I am
running the kernel compile from mandrake 80; version
2.4.3-20mdk on a 
machine Intel celeron 400Mhz 128M RAM, i810 graphic
card (it will use some memory) ; runing together
Star Office 5.2, Netscape 4.77, Mozilla (shiped with
LM80), compiling alsa driver and you may guess how
much swap it used?
[sk@steve sk]$ free
             total       used       free     shared   
buffers     cached
Mem:        126108     124416       1692          0   
    604      51820
-/+ buffers/cache:      71992      54116
Swap:        72288          0      72288
Okay I dont have any other *bloated* software to run
and try to crash it :-)
The same situation when I ran 2.4.5-acx (try all with
13, 14, 15) swap usage is about 45Mb and it is
increasing by the time). After typing a while in
netscpae email form , netscape eats memory gradually
(or the kernel?) swap ran out and the machine went to
deadlock even without thrashing)
But now it is NOT increasing ( I am typing in yahoo
mail from netscape too) , the system is up for about 3
days.
