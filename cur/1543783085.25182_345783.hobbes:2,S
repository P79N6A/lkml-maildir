Hi,
You're right, it should be using simple_rmdir rather than
simple_unlink for removing directories.  Thanks for sending the patch,
which I've modified a bit to avoid splitting the rmdir/unlink cases
into separate functions, since they're almost the same except for what
they end up calling.  relayfs_remove_dir now doesn't do anything but
call relayfs_remove (it didn't do much more than that before anyway),
but it makes sense to me to keep it, as the counterpart to
relayfs_create_dir.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.
Thanks,
Tom
