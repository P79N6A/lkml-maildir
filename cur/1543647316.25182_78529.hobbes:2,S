Hallo all,
I am searching for any owner of USB cable or mainboard containing chip
GL620USB-A, which is _not connected_ to VIA USB hub on any side.
I have a request for a small test, which will help me to trace down
problem - whether found bug is problem of VIA USB driver or GL620USB-A
driver.
There is a test:
1) Verify, whether your USB hub (mainboard) is not VIA. If it is VIA (on
one or both sides), you cannot do this test.
If it is not VIA, you can continue:
2) Please do a few ping and flood ping tests (must be root) and let me
know results (percent of lost packets):
Normal ping tests:
ping -s 2952 second_machine
ping -s 2953 second_machine
(Needed to collect only few packets.)
Ad flood ping tests:
ping -c 1000 -f second_machine
ping -c 1000 -s 2952 -f second_machine
ping -c 1000 -s 2953 -f second_machine
If there is a packet loss, please try both USB hub drivers (UHCI and
alternate UHCI).
Thanks to all for support
