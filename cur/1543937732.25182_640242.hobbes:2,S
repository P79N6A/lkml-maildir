Many thanks for your feedback.
That's what I did first, but if  CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR=m,
arch/x86/kernel/pcspeaker.c gets compiled as a module. While compiling
doesn't fail, is this still a valid module? It defines no init and exit
functions, and it defines an initcall, which only makes sense at boot time.
We could make pcspeaker.c depend on another switch, like
CONFIG_PCSPEAKER on mips. We could offer the possibility to disable it
when CONFIG_EMBEDDED is set.
What do you think?
Michael.
