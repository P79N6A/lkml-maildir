I dare to disagree. It makes for more messy code in general and might
result in the obvious bugs to be replaced by subtle ones that are far
harder to debug.

No ;-) Only fcntl does.

It's also a waste of memory. There are many structures that have a lock
per instance and four extra bytes (for the owner) would be noticeable.
Not that memory is so precious resource, but cachelines may be.

It's not about weather it's easy. It's about weather it's useful.
