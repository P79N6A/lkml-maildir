I guess for stuff like fan_div, etc at least, is that not all the
chips are on spec, the sensors are located on different places,
and the why the manufacturer of the board did things could all
influence things.  Thus you need to be able to tweak fan_dev,
etc for each board individually to get the most precise reading.
For instance, what my bios say, and what the raw reading from 
/proc is, is two different things.  I also had to slightly adjust
things between some models of Asus boards I had.
