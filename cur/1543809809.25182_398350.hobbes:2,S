wow this is really great... but just for your information
on my ibm notebook the output is this:
        Disk parameter table(s) at vector 0x41
Disk0
    Cylinders = 1024
      Sectors = 63
        Heads = 240
Write precomp = 255
 Landing zone = 65296
        Reserved bit 0 set
        Reserved bit 1 set
        Reserved bit 2 set
        More than 8 heads
        Reserved bit 4 set
        Defect map present
        Disable retries
        Disable retries
Disk1
    Cylinders = 1024
      Sectors = 4
        Heads = 16
Write precomp = 0
 Landing zone = 0
        Disk parameter table(s) at vector 0x46
Disk0
    Cylinders = 34281
      Sectors = 240
        Heads = 230
Write precomp = 7950
 Landing zone = 61
        Reserved bit 2 set
        More than 8 heads
        Disable retries
Disk1
    Cylinders = 47631
      Sectors = 102
        Heads = 46
Write precomp = 3698
 Landing zone = 7952
        More than 8 heads
        Defect map present
        Disable retries
Just Note the "MAX" of 240 heads (very typical for IBM notebooks).
But anyway this tool is very useful for me. many, many thanks.
