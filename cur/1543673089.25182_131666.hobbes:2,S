I receive messages with about 40 lines of headers each, and most of them
have less than 30 lines of body, so on this point I must agree with Folkert.
Since we have long threads, most of the messages are small replies, like this
one I'm writing now. I'm fairly certain it will still have headers longer than
body.
Cheers,
Willy
