Yeah, that's not enforceable in NOMMU-mode situations.  I presume it differs
from munmap() also in that it can effectively be forced by one process upon
another.
In MMU-mode, how does this work with private mappings that have some private
copies of the pages that make up the mapping?  Are those still available to a
process that is using them?  Are they revoked when swapped out?  Or are they
forcibly evicted?

Okay.

That's a bit over the top, I think.  It sounds like revoke() is perfectly fine
- as long as there aren't any mappings on the target inode (or at least shared
mappings - dunno about private mappings).

That sounds feasible.  How about -ETXTBSY instead?

Hmmm... maybe.  That sounds a bit antisocial though, but is also workable.
Does the SIGBUS raised have its own si_code, btw?  Perhaps BUS_REVOKED?

Agreed.
