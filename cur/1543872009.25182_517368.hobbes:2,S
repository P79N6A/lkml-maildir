I guess that it is because 'paravirt_ops' was exported as GPL symbol, whereas
the vmware module doen't declare any license.
I tried to add the following line:
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
into vmmon.tar and vmnet.tar under /usr/lib/vmare/modules/source/,
then it works.
 (but maybe will tear the copyright by VMWare Inc.)
my kernel: 2.6.21-rc3 with CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y
