Oh crap, I'm an idiot.  I've even seen prototype patches for this one
that changed the write_lock() to write_lock_irq(). Duh.

I don't see an easy one: PPC 4xx has non-coherent cache, so we have to
mark consistent memory non-cacheable.  We want to make the normal
lowmem mapping use large page TLB entries, so we can't frob the
attribute bits on the pages in place.  That means we need to create a
new, non-cacheable mapping for the physical RAM we allocate, which in
turn means allocating a chunk of kernel virtual memory.
