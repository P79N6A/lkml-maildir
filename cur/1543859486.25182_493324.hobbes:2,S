As far as I'm aware the way in which scsi_do_req() was to insert at the 
head of the queue, leading to projects like SCST to come up with 
scsi_do_req_fifo() as queuing multiple commands using scsi_do_req() with 
constant head insertion might lead to out of order execution.
Just thought I'd throw some light on the history and what others have 
done in the past.
