Yep. Already done, from day one even: All file access checks for *root* are
userspace only, and we are talking about root-only stuff here.

Use another system then. Unix/Linux _is_ dangerous, it has little safety
net built in. And I like it exactly because of this, it allows me to boldly
go where no other system I've seen lets me go even near.
To get what you are asking for would give a kernel source of a gigabyte or
so (just add up all the funny things you might want to send to a random
IDE, SCSI, FireWire, USB, ... device, consider that downloadable firmware
is becomming the norm, and devices are proliferating like never before),
and _that_ doesn't scale at all.
