If these things become kernel options (so they can be left out if you,
for instance, don't have Ciscos in your network or don't need to talk IP
with Macs), why the argument? Whoever doesn't need it will have the
blazingly fast IP stack they want.
Speaking of kernel options (Linus and the rest of the inner circle
hear), shouldn't we have kernel options for things like, max number of
total/perprocess open files, inodes and the like?
I don't subscribe to Linux-Kernel, so reply to me please.
