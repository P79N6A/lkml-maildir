I think perhaps the true bug lies in the way we handle layered devices
like this.  pktcdvd holds the underlying device open, so its refcount
never drops to zero.  This is what causes the gendisk/block layer never
to update the sizes, and what lead to pktcdvd doing it instead.
However, what perhaps really needs to happen is that pktcdvd needs to
take over the media change events as well.  That way it could see the
disk change and invalidate and reread its own setting of the block size
(and possibly re set the size of the underlying device).
I agree, though, this isn't a regression.  It's probably obscure enough
in reproduction to warrant not holding up 2.6.24 --- especially as I
think the true fix will do small perturbations to a lot of subsystems.
If this were a product and I were the release manager, I'd be updating
the release notes with a note about having to break pktcdvd binding
across media changes to work around this bug and a promise to fix it in
the next release.
