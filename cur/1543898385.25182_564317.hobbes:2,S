I have a pile more for you here including finally nailing a nasty
corruptor on some chipsets. Guess what certain chips do given a PRD entry
of
            someaddress
            0x00000000
Not generating those seems to sort out the CS5530 and probably the SC1200.
I've also got the patches to print all the iomap addresses properly, get
the HPT343 working fully solidly in PIO (some DMA problems - anyone got
ancient HPT docs for the 343/345/363 anywhere). The ide/pci driver isn't
any use as a reference as that one doesn't work either.
