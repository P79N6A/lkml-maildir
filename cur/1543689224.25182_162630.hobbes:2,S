Well, I wouldn't put it that strongly.
It's more like, at least in my own case, the Debian people make a stink 
about the legality of non-GPL'd firmwares.  And certain people, and at 
certain times, have refused patches related to legality of firmwares. 
AND, on top of all that, as a programmer I hate seeing these ugly BLOBs 
embedded in C code, and would much rather see them removed from the C 
source code.
So, I "prefer" that firmware leaves the kernel, but that's just my 
personal opinion.  There has been no decision made AFAIK, and I don't 
recall Marcelo or Linus speaking definitively on the subject.

Agreed...
