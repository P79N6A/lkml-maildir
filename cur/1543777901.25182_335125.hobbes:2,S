I'm no VM guru but I have a 32 bit machine here with 8 GB of
memory and 8 GB of swap:
# mount -t tmpfs -o size=$((12*1024*1024*1024)) tmpfs /mnt
# df
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1             19228276   1200132  17051396   7% /
tmpfs                 12582912         0  12582912   0% /mnt
There you go, a 12 GB tmpfs. I haven't tried to create a 12 GB
file on it, though, since this is a production machine and it
needs the memory ..
So yes that appears to work just fine.
Mike.
