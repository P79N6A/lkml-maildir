Well, careful: depending on what "%" means, a 8-cpu machine has either
"100% max" or "800% max".
So are we talking about "we spend 40-60% of all CPU cycles in the
scheduler" or are we talking about "we spend 40-60% of the CPU power of
_one_ CPU out of 8 in the scheduler".
Yes, 40-60% sounds like a lot ("Wow! About half the time is spent in the
scheduler"), but I bet it's 40-60% of _one_ CPU, which really translates
to "The worst scheduler case I've ever seen under a real load spent 5-8%
of the machine CPU resources on scheduling".
And let's face it, 5-8% is bad, but we're not talking "half the CPU power"
here.
