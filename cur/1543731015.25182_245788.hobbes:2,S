Certainly possible.

That would likely be the _easiest_ approach for the kernel, and does solve 
the problem with some apps knowingly removing the trailing '/'.
Note that we could try this out with existing filesystems with very 
minimal changes:
 - make directory bind mounts work on top of files ("graft_tree()")
 - make open_namei() and friend _not_ do the mount-point following for the 
   last component if it's a non-directory.
 - probably some trivial fixups I haven't thought about. There might be 
   some places that use "S_ISDIR()" to check for whether something can be 
   looked up, but the main path walking already just checks whether there
   is a ".lookup" operation or not.
This would already allow people to "try out" how different applications 
would react to a file that can show up both as a directory and a file. The 
patch might end up being less than 25 lines or so, the difficulty is in 
finding all the right places.
Al, anything I missed?
(And yes, it's a quick hack, but it's a quick hack that would probably
mimic a good part of what we would have to do internally in the VFS layer
to support this notion anyway).
