could you make sched_setscheduler() also include a parameter for the
nice value, so that ->static_prio could be set at the same time too
(which would have relevance if SCHED_OTHER is used)? This would make it
a generic kernel-internal API to change all the priority parameters.
Looks good otherwise.
