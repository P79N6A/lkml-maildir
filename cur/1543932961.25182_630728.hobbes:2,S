Oh well, after seeing the move of cancel_dirty_page, I just went
backwards from __set_page_dirty using cscope + some smart guessing and
quickly ended up at ext3_invalidatepage, so it wasn't that hard :-)

Hm, you attributed more to my mail than there was actually in it. I
didn't even start to think of cleanups (because I don't know jack about
the whole ext3/jdb stuff, so I simply cannot come up with any cleanups
(yet?)).What I meant is that we only did a half-revert of that hackery.
When try_to_free_buffers started to check for PG_dirty, the
cancel_dirty_page call had to be called before do_invalidatepage, to
"fix" a _huge_ leak.  But that caused the accouting breakage we're now
seeing, because we never account for the pages that got redirtied during
do_invalidatepage.
Then the change to try_to_free_buffers got reverted, so we no longer
need to call cancel_dirty_page before do_invalidatepage, but still we
do. Thus the accounting bug remains. So what I meant to suggest was
simply to actually "finish" the revert we started.
Or expressed as a patch:

I'll be the last one to comment on whether or not that causes inaccurate
accouting, so I'll just watch you and Jan battle that out until someone
comes up with a post-.24 patch to provide a clean fix for the issue.
Krzysztof, could you give this patch a test run?
If that "fixes" the problem for now, I'll try to come up with some
usable commit message, or if somehow wants to beat me to it, you can
already have my

Yeah, you're right. It's symmetric with __set_page_dirty, which only
calls task_io_account_write when there's a mapping.
