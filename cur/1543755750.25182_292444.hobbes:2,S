I'm not happy about that one -- the PCI access.c guarantees the pointer
is non-NULL.  But I'm going to do a sweep to catch all of these, so I'll
just undo it then.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
