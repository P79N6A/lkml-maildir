It has to schedule for every syscall, that is the major overhead. Normally,
simple system calls should be nearly as fast as normal subroutine calls, but
such ucore program would definitely kill it.
On the other side, if some kind of corename patch makes it into the kernel
and administrator chooses to put all core files e.g to
/tmp/cores/core.<pid>, then some ucore program can poll on /tmp/cores and
once it notices a new file created there, just spawn a debugger or whatever
the user wants (not that I'd like to do it on my machines).
But such thing should be implemented in userland, why to bloat the kernel.
Cheers,
