Hi.
I have massive problems with linux-2.6.0-test2.
When some process writes something to disk, it's very hard
to go on working with the system.
Some test-szenario:
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=./test.file
While dd is running, xmms skips playing every now and then
and the mouse is near to be unusable. The Mouse-cursor
behaves some kind of very lazy and some times it jumps
from one point on the display to another.
When I stop disk-access, it works again quite fine.
Would be cool, if you could give me some point to start
for tracking this down.
Please CC me, as I'm not subscribed to linux-ide. Thanks.
