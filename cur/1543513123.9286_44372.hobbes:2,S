Well, considering that shm_swapout() currently looks like this:
	static int shm_swapout(struct vm_area_struct * vma, struct page * page)
	{ 
	        return 0;
	}
I don't think the SHM case is all that problematic: we could easily just
have a dummy vma->vm_file there. In fact, it probably should do so anyway:
the SHM code _really_ does not need the private member.
There are strong arguments for saying that if the thing you're mapping
actually _needs_ the vma in order to swap out, then the thing is broken.
SHM certainly used to be horribly broken in this area, but that's no
longer true.
