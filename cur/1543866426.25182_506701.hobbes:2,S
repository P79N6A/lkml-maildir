So you are saying that b and c are primary, and a is used to calculate
a safe value for d.   All of the above work is dont, just from a
different starting point?

Ok so its arbitray load count to max vs count and compare.   A critical
detail when computing the value to load, but the net result is the
same; the value for the count it hard to determine.

Oh, so the lfsr doesn't have to be recomputed, only the time
between unloads.

I was looking at the patch and the context was not very good.   You
might consider adding -p to your diff command, it provides the function
name after the @@.
However, in this case, I think I just need to see the final result.

[So you have not asked.]
<Kludge> If you want to overlaod the existing array, one
event could be the lfsr sample rate, and another event be
the collection time.  That would stay within the framework.
But that is a kludge. </Kludge>
[Me goes and reads kernel profile driver and skims powerpc code].
You are confusing the user interface (what the user specifies on the
command line) with the kernel API.
It is somewhat hidden by the PowerPC specific common code in
arch/powerpc/oprofile/common.c.  That is where the counter
array is exposd.
The user to kernel api is not fill out an array of counter
event names and sampling intervals.
The user to kernel interface is a file system that contains a
heirachy of files.  Each file consists of the hex ascii
represntation of a unsigned long.   The filesystem interfaces
to the kernel by provding an API to create directorys and files,
specifing the name of the directory or file.  Theere are helper
routines to connect a file to a ulong and read access to an atomic_t.
The common driver (in drivers/oprofile) creates the file system
and some common files that implement the control interface, which
interfaces to the architecture specific driver through the ops
array.
The powerpc common driver creates a heiarchy exposing the
values to be placed in the performance monitor registers,
and directory of counters with the event selection.
Since this architeture code does not seem to match the
capabilitys of the hardware, it would seem that this is
the area to change.   This driver does not seem to use
the actual PMU interrput or sprs.   Lets make it its
own directory with its own controls.
I don't see how exposing the sample collection to
rate and the computation of the LFSR create a userspace
api change;  I think its totally within the framework.

Why does the table have to be linear?  Compute samples at various
logrimathic staring points.   Determine how many significant bits
you want to keep, and have an array for each sample length.
ie for 3 bits of significance, you could have
F00000, E00000, ... 800000,   0F0000, ......
this would take (24-n) * 2^(n-1) slots, while maintaing user
control of the range.

When calling a user space program.   The events are converted to
a series of control register values that are communicated to the
kernel by writing to files in the file system.   The writes are
interpreted (converted from ascii hex to binary longs) and stored
until the control files are written, at which point callbacks
copy and interpret the controls and start the hardware collection.
Frankly, I would expect a lot more resistance to the event data
stream generation changes and duplicaton.
