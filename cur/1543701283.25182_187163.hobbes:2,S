Interrupts are _not_ disabled here, very much on purpose. If they were, 
then "jiffies" wouldn't update, and the timeouts wouldn't work.
This is what that _stupid_ "local_irq_set()" function does: it saves the 
old irq masking state, and then it enables it.
The whole concept doesn't make any sense. If you enable interrupts, there 
is little point in saving the callers irq mask, since it already got 
deflated.
