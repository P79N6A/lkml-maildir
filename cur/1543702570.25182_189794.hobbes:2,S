I had several such cases with 2.4.23 on two separate boxes. First is dual PIII 
1GHz Intel SRMK2 platform - 
http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/srmk2/
 with 1,5GB RAM, 
reiserfs as filesystem, scsi disks and Adaptec AIC-7899P U160/m controller.
Second was UP PIII 500MHz machine on some Intel BX mainboard, 256MB RAM, ext3 
as filesystem, software raid 5 on scsi disks using aic7xxx (Adaptec AIC-7892B 
U160/m).
First one was locking up few times per day (pretty big load), second one maybe 
once per day/two (lower load).
Both machines are working _fine_ with 2.4.21 kernel (one was also using 2.4.22 
for some time and no problems occured).
kernels on both machines were exactly the same (just copied) but using 
different modules - kernel was compiled using 2.95.4 (3+some parts from 2.95 
branch of gcc cvs)

Similar here - but sometimes even sysrq wasn't working (on second machine).

Exactly same here.
append=" console=tty0 console=ttyS0,9600n81 panic=60 nmi_watchdog=1"
I was thinking that maybe that's due to some problem in aic7xxx driver and 
updated it on one machine to latest available version (these in kernel are 
very old) but that didn't help.
