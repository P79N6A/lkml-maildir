You've so far only made ubacked claims in this thread.  Show the
numbers and tell us why your implementation is faster and show the
numbers and explain why this change should make your module slower.
If you can't benefit from using the page frame + offset the worst
thing you'd have to do is doing the kmap yourself instead of loop.c
doing it.  And no, kmap doesn't get magically slower when called from
a different module.
