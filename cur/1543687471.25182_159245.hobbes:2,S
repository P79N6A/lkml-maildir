Well, I've got a board with these problems, too... (Epox 8K9A)
It seems the ACPI IRQ override tables are buggy, so it cannot work... :-(
But with 'pci=noacpi' it should work as the Documentation states:
       noacpi                  [IA-32] Do not use ACPI for IRQ routing.
Unfortunately the ACPI IO-APIC setup is not overridden and without the 
attached patch, which corrects this issue, I had to use 'acpi=off'...
I think this will help people easily working around their APCI interrupt 
routing problems, as I think most of these are due to buggy ACPI IRQ override 
tables. Windows seems not to use them and so they are often badly 
tested... :-(
Best regards

BTW: Hunk 3 of this patch is only a simplification, because(acpi_lapic && 
acpi_ioapic) is always true here when that code is reached...
