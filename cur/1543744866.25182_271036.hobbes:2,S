   Why can't it absorb a wakeup and still return -EAGAIN when this happens?
   IOW why not apply this patch to the original code?
================================================================================
        return -EINTR;
 
  out_unqueue:
-       /* If we were woken (and unqueued), we succeeded, whatever. */
-       if (!unqueue_me(&q))
-               ret = 0;
+       unqueue_me(&q); /* ignore result from unqueue */
  out_release_sem:
        up_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
        return ret;

   ...and what is "Emergency Services", BTW?
