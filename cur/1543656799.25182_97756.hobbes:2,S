Probably there will be some benefits, at least for a while, if valgrind for UML
"knows" the kernel allocators like valgrind for applications "knows" malloc+free.
Implementors of allocators can have bugs in the valgrind declarations they add.
An "independent" check based on documented externally-visible behavior can help.
Nested allocators (inner allocator grabs a large region, outer allocator performs
sub-allocations of small pieces from the large region) can be troublesome.
Implementing a four-state status {-, W, RW, RO} might be much more work,
because some accounting schemes are oriented naturally towards only three states
{-, W, RW}.  Also, there are contenders for two additional states: watchpoints
for READ and WRITE, such as "any read of a back-pointer of this doubly-linked
list", etc.
