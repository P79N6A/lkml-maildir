I have my doubts that's really worth it, but ok.

Patch looks good for me too.  Thanks.
Unfortunately Andrew's point with the GFP_NOFS still applies :/
But I would consider any caller of this not handling NULL be broken.
Andrew do you have any stronger evidence it's a real problem?
Another way would be to force a default non strict policy with GFP_NOFS, but
that would be somewhat ugly again and impact the fast paths.
