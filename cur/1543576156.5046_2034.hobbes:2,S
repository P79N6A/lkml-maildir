Keith,
thanks for your hint. The problem seems that all modules (+ directory 
~/media) under /lib/modules/2.4.0-test13pre3/kernel/drivers/media/  are 
missing. Make modules_install does not build the directory ~/media and its 
contents. There were no modules built under /linux/drivers/media/video or 
~radio.
BTW: this time I used 2.4.0-test13pre3 + your minipatch ...
kind regards
Norbert
