Hi !
I want to use my soundcard in PC1 with applications from PC2 (has no
soundcard). PC1 and PC2 are connected by Fast-Ethernet (DEC 21140-
"tulip"-cards and X-over cable).
Is there a way to redirect the /dev/dsp, /dev/audio, /dev/mixer ...
over the network so that applications on PC2 "think", that there is a
local soundcard available?
Any HOW-TOs? Any hints?
Greetings
Raphael Becker
