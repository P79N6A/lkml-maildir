I've run a git bisect from 2.6.14 to 2.6.15 to find what broke the NFS
client.
It seems to be the GIT patch: 24aa1fe6779eaddb3e0b1b802585dcf6faf9cc44
that introduces the problem.
Trond, it took me a lot of tries with GIT to narrow this down, because
the problem does not show up consistently. Some times nfsbench would
complete very quickly, but then a second (or third or ...) run would run
slow.
Could I ask you to try: 
 for i in `seq 1 100`; do time ./nfsbench; done
or something like that?
I'm looking through the patch, but to be honest the NFS cache internals
isn't really something I understand... :)
