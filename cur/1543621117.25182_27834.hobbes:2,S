Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.4, add help texts to drivers/net/pcmcia/Config.help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/2/13/182

In drivers/net/pcmcia/Config.in, there are two options which currently do
not have help texts in drivers/net/pcmcia/Config.help.  Here are snippets
from the Config.in for these options:
dep_tristate '  broken NS8390-cards support' CONFIG_PCMCIA_AXNET $CONFIG_PCMCIA
if [ "$CONFIG_CARDBUS" = "y" ]; then
     tristate '  Xircom CardBus support (new driver)' CONFIG_PCMCIA_XIRCOM
     tristate '  Xircom Tulip-like CardBus support (old driver)' CONFIG_PCMCIA_XIRTULIP
fi
Here is a patch to drivers/net/pcmcia/Config.help to add these help texts.
