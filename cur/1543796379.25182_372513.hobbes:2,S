I already told you the result:

Aha. So it seems you withdraw the "remote" part, and say that
a local user can leave a process with an open filedescriptor
on a console, and that process can be used to access the console
later. True.
But there are many ways of using such a file descriptor.
This patch cripples the keymap changing but does not solve anything.
The basic problem is that some things are common for all virtual
consoles, while on the other hand vhangup() on one VC does not
influence the other VCs.
Probably those common parts should be split and made per-VC.
