Hi,
    I have problems about the system calls on Linux. Please do me a favor.
The problem is:
If operation 1 that renames A to B and operation 2 that renames B to C, and
the two operations run concurrently.
Is it possible  that operation 2 is invoked and operation 1 does not return
? How does Linux serialize the two operations?
Thanks in advance.
Warren
