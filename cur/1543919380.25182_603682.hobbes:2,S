Thanks for the reply
I have tested my program on PC and it works without any problem.
I have enabled auto negotiation.  The status register shows successful
completion of auto-negotiation.
And it shows using full duplex.
I did check whether the packets are getting dropped because of lack of
space.  But it is not the case.  I even created huge number of transmit
descriptors enough to fit 1.5 MBytes of data.  But still it slows down
after about 200 KB.  I even have used the setsockopt option available in
user program.  Nothing seems to increase the speed.
Any pointers on this would be greatly helpful
Thanking you
Jupe
