That is my guess regarding 2.2 (and earlier).  2.4 and
future it is explicitly tested in proc_fd_readlink() which
only applies to the links in /proc/$pid

And i can so no reason why either should be restricted.  There
is no confidential information therein and these symlinks do
not open any access that wouldn't already exist.

So what?  If the reason for your post was to suggest that
the maps file should be 400 then you should have said so.  I
don't think doing so would have any security value unless
you believe in security through obscurity.  The only
indiscretion i can think of would be to reveal the existence
of a file in a directory with --x perms (occasionally good for privacy,
always poor for security) in which case you would want maps
and all the /proc/$pid/* links restricted.

Proc mounted inside a chrooted or jailed namespace is a
completely different issue.  As would be the value of the
links where the observed is chrooted.
