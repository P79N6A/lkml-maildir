Baloney.  You can't swap out what is actively in use, and something
that's overmounted is actively used.  You're supposed to clean up the
contents before overmounting.  I discussed with viro a scheme (using
two ramfs's) which made that close to automatic, but I think he
thought it was needless complexity.
