	Hi!
 I think you are right that do_gettimeofday() is limited to microsec even
on boxes with TSC register. This function returns only seconds and
microseconds so you won't get better resolution with it. I don't know the
way how to do it, but I wonder about precision of such mechanism (if any
exists).
