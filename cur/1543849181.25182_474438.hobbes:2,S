I am now more certain - the above gives an example of serious breakage
with the current mechanism of connecting cpusets to sched domains via
the cpuset flag.
We should either fix it (perhaps with my patch to add sched_domain
flags to cpusets, plus a yet to be written patch to make sched domains
visible via /sys or some such place), or we should nuke it,
I am now 90% certain we should nuke the entire mechanism connecting
cpusets to sched domains via the cpu_exclusive flag.
The only useful thing to be done, which is much simpler, is to provide
someway to manipulate the cpu_isolated_map at runtime.
I have a pair of patches ready to ship out that do this.
Coming soon to a mailing list near you ...
