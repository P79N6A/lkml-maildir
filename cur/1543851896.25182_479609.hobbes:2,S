The BIOS check is a must, it checks bit #0 of MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL,
if it set this means that software cannot write to the MSR. If bit #2 is
clear too then when executing vmxon you'll get #GP.
So the check should better be there...

  I have some problems on Thinkpad z61t with Core Duo T2500.
/proc/cpuinfo shows "vmx" in flags, but module refuses to load:
[17462106.632000] kvm: disabled by bios
 I wandered around BIOS setup (latest version), but didn't found
anything about virtualization. Is BIOS check really necessary?
