Ah ha! I think I figured out what my problem was with the naming (I
*just* can't get my head around it). As we added the cpus_idle() hooks,
recover_time() and other non-per-interrupt-source related functionality,
I think it might be best to name this structure:
struct dyntick_control;
indicating it's dynamic tick basis, but that it's used to control the
subsystem.
I think that makes it clear, and keeps it clear why we have
non-"timer" stuff in there. It's also much clearer to me now why we
*don't* need it per-CPU, as we're relying on one set of callbacks for a
subsystem, and not for each CPU's hardware (works out to be the same,
but makes more sense to me that way).
Does that make more sense?
Thanks,
Nish
