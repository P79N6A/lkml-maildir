It's not actually a pathname we care about, but a vfsmount + dentry
combo.  That one means as much in nfsd as elsewhere.  We want nfsd
to obey r/o or noatime mount flags if /export/foo is exported with them
but /foo not.  Even better would be to change nfsd so it creates it's
own non-visible vfsmount for the filesystems it exports..

This doesn't matter.  hardlinks are per definition on the same vfsmount.

no, we won't.
