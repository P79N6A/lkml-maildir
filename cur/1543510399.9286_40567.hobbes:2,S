Normally you map kernel pages into user space for this. A simple example
is the dmaram driver in 2.3.18ac, or the sound drivers - which map a chunk
of kernel buffer into user space and give uses access to a buffer being used
for DMA.
2.3.x adds stuff for locking down page groups for direct I/O but that isn't
in standard 2.2 kernels
