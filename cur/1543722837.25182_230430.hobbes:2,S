With an older kernel I'd say he's losing 9% of his clock ticks.
In this case though, incompatible /proc/stat changes are
at fault. No longer does idle CPU time include IO-wait CPU time.
This shouldn't have changed; user tools can subtract as needed.
I'm sorry to say that the HZ-guessing code is now only
used for the 2.2.xx kernels. Over the years it has found
many clock problems. Had the 2.4.xx kernels used a 64-bit
jiffies counter, the HZ-guessing code would still be used.
You never did come up with an alternative to HZ-guessing
that would work on those old 1200-HZ Alpha boxes, the ARM
boxes that ran at 64 HZ and so on. I suppose you can blame
the arch maintainers, but user-space has to deal with it.
So HZ-guessing is a workaround for a kernel bug, especially
because you claim that HZ (USER_HZ now) is part of the ABI.
