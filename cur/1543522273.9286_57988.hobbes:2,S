Agreed, media change is a wonderful feature. 
It's just that as it stands now, it HAS to work. There used to be floppies
around that didn't do media change right, and they simple did not work at
all (well, you could force it by hand), and it was horrible. 
Media change should be a "politeness" and timeliness issue rather than a
correctness issue, and that's really all I'm saying. It's a quality of
implementation thing - you should be able to not care.
(The write-back handling will need some work at some point, we should be
more aggressive about writing things out in a timely manner to floppies in
particular. There's no reason to leave the drive idle but spinning and yet
have a ton of dirty blocks around that we're just waiting to write out.
That's independent of the media change, but would be another step into the
direction of not making it such a big deal - people should be able to
remove a floppy from a drive where the light is off without it being
necessarily catastrophic).
