Andrea, I don't agree with you on this.
If 2.6.16 succeeds, some people who currently cannot rely on 2.6 due
to its code changing too fast will be able to make the move. Also, those
who need a good reliability will be able to check in one year if they
consider it reliable enough for their use, based on other user's feedback.
Once those users depend on this kernel, they will probably send fixes
back when they'll find a bug. Right now, many people using 2.6 just
run it off the CD of their pet distro, and when something goes wrong,
they decide the distro is broken and they change to anything else
(which might have a different kernel version). Do not believe that
everyone has enough knowledge to send valuable bug reports and/or
fix bugs. Basically, you have them all reading this list on a somewhat
regular basis.

Well, you've been fighting over opinions. Both of you have been a bit
rude with the other one. Adrian has finally removed his mocking (and
IMHO childish) signature. Why don't you consider the problem solved
and keep your project online ?
