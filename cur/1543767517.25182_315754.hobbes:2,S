OK.  I ended up with an odd-looking arch/um/sys-x86_64/util/Makefile:
# Copyright 2003 - 2004 Pathscale, Inc
# Released under the GPL
hostprogs-y	:= mk_sc mk_thread
always		:= $(hostprogs-y)
HOSTCFLAGS_mk_thread.o := -I$(objtree)/arch/um
Is mk_sc still supposed to be in there?

I just "fixed" things.  I do it all the time.
