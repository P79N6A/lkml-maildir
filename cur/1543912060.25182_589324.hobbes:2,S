There must be something else wrong, cause the problem persists .. As I
said in past emails to Bjorn, I tested his commit in git, as well as the
latest git all with the same issue (as well as bisecting git)..
If the hardware is buggy then we need some way to determine that..
If this machine didn't support performance counters, what would happen
then?
