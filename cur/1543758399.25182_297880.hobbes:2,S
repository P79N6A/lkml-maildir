Hi,
Yesterday evening me an my friend had to shut down our most beloved 
server. It had run for 6 years, 2 months and 25 days non stop. Nothing 
could harm this little mailserver: y2k, electricity problems in the house 
and no hacker found it.
We had to shut it down because of renovation of the room.
486 DX 33Mhz
8   MB RAM 
32  MB SWAP
340 MB Connor Harddisk
Kernel 2.0.36
SuSE 5.3
4 uptime wrap arounds. 
Thanks a lot for this rock solid piece of software!
      Thomas and Bastian
