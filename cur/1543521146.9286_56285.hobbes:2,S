Which leads me wonder how difficult it would be if I wanted to change the
format of /proc/partitions from:
    "%4d  %4d %10d %s\n",
    p->major, n,
    p->sizes[n],
    disk_name(p, n, buf)
to:
    "%4d  %4d  %10d %s %02x\n",
    p->major, n,
    p->sizes[n],
    disk_name(p, n, buf),
    p->sys_ind
That is, to include the partition type.
It would eliminate the need to be able to parse six kinds of partition
table in a program I am modifying, but also potentially break many
programs that rely on the current format.  Are, could or should there be
rules for formats, that they can be extended while retaining backwards
compatibility?  (Creating a parallel "/proc/xpartitions", while easy to
do, does not appeal to me.)
Regards,
Mark.
