I beleive we should not confuse DMA-able and unached. DMA can be
perfectly fine on cachable memory on a non-coherent architecture if you
do the appropriate flush when needed. Making all DMA memory non-cachable
would have a huge performance hit on some platform.

I'll let more competent people handle this and keep my vmalloc stuff for
now ;-)
