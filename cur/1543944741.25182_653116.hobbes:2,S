Right. Sorry. I focused so much on getting the driver to work correctly
that I totally forgot about these things.
I'll fix it up before the next round (which I hope can be labeled
"PATCH" instead of "RFC".)
Btw, this isn't the latest version of the driver...but I'm afraid the
latest one suffers from these omissions too, except for the last one
which I did actually remove.
