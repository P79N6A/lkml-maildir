Three comments
1.	Use inlines not defines when you can - it means we get type
checking
2.	There is an RTC timer interface - could you use that interface
for some of this so its compatible and consistent ?
3.	Ditto for a watchdog use - although that would be a separate
driver using the kernel hooks anyway.
Kernel side looks fairly sane
