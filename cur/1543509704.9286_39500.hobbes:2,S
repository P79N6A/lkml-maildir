	Hmmm...  Have you upgraded your kernel.  I think the stock 2.2.5
kernel with RedHat 6.0 is vulnerable to a zero length fragment attack.
Current kernel version is 2.2.12.

	Probably smurf attacks...

	Your system administrator is on drugs.  The problem was a bug in
the kernel but was not a race condition.
	Are you running NIS on those Solaris boxes?  How about finger?  If
the answer is yes to both, tell your system administrator that anyone can
obliterate your entire network just with well timed finger requests.  The
Solaris boxes will flood the network with NIS requests and tear it to its
knees.  Sun has no fix.  Only options are to avoid NIS (including NIS+),
or avoid finger (good idea anyways), or use a "public domain" finger.  The
finger that comes with Linux is not vulnerable.
> Is there some way to reconfigure my system to make it less vulnerable?
	Keep it up to date.  Same thing can be said about Solaris, or
Windows, or any other operating system or distribution.  There are a pile
of update RPM's out there for RedHat 6.0 and a lot of them are security
related.  Get them installed.
