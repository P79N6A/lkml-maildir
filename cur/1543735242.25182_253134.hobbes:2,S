Not a bug, but a feature.

AFAIK all.  There are products which depend on this behavior.

IMHO you have to switch to 16bit stack, load upper bits of ESP 
with target value, and then execute IRET, while 16bit SS:SP points 
to same place where flat ESP pointed.  
This way IRET, as stack is 16bit, uses only SP instead of ESP, 
and so you can preload upper bits of ESP before executing IRET. 
And I do not think that linux NMI handler survives 16bit stack, so 
natural solution seems to be to create complete 16bit CPL1 
environment, return to it, load ESP as you want, and then do IRET 
to return to CPL2 or CPL3.  Fortunately V8086 mode is not affected, 
so there should be no problem with using CPL1 for this middle step.  
But of course it is not something you want to do on each return 
from interrupt handler...  Well, or maybe you want...

It is part of architecture now...
