This works fine for me, thanks.
Three questions if you do not mind:
1)  Is it possible to maintain naming of tarball/version ?  Meaning,
    say we forget about the 003 version, could the next be 0.4, or even
    0.3.1 or whatever ?  Just changing makes trying to keep packages
    sane a hassle.  Thanks :)
2)  Is the libsysfs included later than that in sysfsutils-0_2_0.tar.gz?
    If not, any idea if/when udev will start following official
    libsysfs?  Yes, not a biggie, but it would be nice to have
    sysfsutils its own package :)
3)  Any plans to have namedev support wildcarts ?  Like:
  dsp*:root:audio:0660
  audio*:root:audio:0660
  midi*:root:audio:0660
  mixer*:root:audio:0660
Thanks!
