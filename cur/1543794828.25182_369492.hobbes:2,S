As far as the kernel is concerned this hasn't been a problem in a while
(2.4.early). The iget4 operation that was introduced by reiserfs (now
iget5) pretty much makes it possible for a filesystem to use anything to
identify it's inodes. The 32-bit inode numbers are simply used as a hash
index.
The only thing that tends to break are userspace archiving tools like
tar, which assume that 2 objects with the same 32-bit st_ino value are
identical. I think that by now several actually double check that the
inode linkcount is larger than 1.
