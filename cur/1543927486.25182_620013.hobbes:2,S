I don't understand yet how lockdep behaves if the work struct gets
reused and the reused one finishes first.
I renamed the kcryptd functions today in an attempt to disentangle this
code a bit more.
  - io->pending reference counting looks correct (though used
inconsistently when comparing READ with WRITE)
  - But what happens if kcryptd_crypt_write_convert_loop() calls
INIT_WORK/queue_work twice?
