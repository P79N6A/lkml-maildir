Just for the lkml archives and google to have it - I have just committed 
to ipwireless_cs git tree a patch that makes the driver work also with V3 
cards.

    ipwireless_cs: make the V3 card ppp connections work

    not DIAL channel - when being sent on DIAL channel, the ppp framer
    on the card is not configured properly.
