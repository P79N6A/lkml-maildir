Shared pagetables, it's a non-root application.

That could be interesting... so if the server has a mmap()ed file and
forks a child when a connection comes in, the tables would get duplicated
even with the patch? That's not going to help me.

I have to go back and look at that code to be sure, you may be right.
There certainly are other things which are mmap()ed by all children (or
threads, depending on implementation) which might benefit since they're
moderately large and do have hundreds to thousands of copies.
