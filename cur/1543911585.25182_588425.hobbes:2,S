What architecture?
if x86_64 then perhaps something went wrong with the old x86_64 dynticks
leftovers which were in rc3-mm1.  I've just merged a shiny fresh new series
so perhaps things there got fixed.  Please retest next -mm.
Suitable cc's added.

Presumably related to the time problem.

Dunno, there're some significant-looking cpufreq changes in there, such as
cpufreq-allow-ondemand-and-conservative-cpufreq-governors-to-be-used-as-default.patch.
Maybe we went and chose a different governor for you?
Perhaps it would be helpful if you could do a 
	diff -u dmesg-2.6.23-rc3 dmesg-2.6.26-rc3-mm1
?

OK, thanks.
