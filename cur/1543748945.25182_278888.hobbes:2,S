i am aware that UDP is connectionless.  However in terms of a firewall
this is different.  It _must_ keep a state table of some sorts otherwise
high port outbound connections destined for a DNS server will never be
let back in b/c the firewall will just say "Why is this dns server
making a udp connection to port 32768 on this client?".  Keeping a state
table allows this behavior thru the firewall as it should.
My issue is that linux is not randomizing or incrementing the ports it
uses for udp connections to prevent this sort of issue since udp is
connectionless.  We dont have sequence numbers or the sorts like TCP to
sort this out, we only have source ip and port.
Other OS's seem  to do this and thus apps are not getting broken when
connections are made thru the firewall, which is why i originally posted
the question.  I was hoping that maybe there is some workaround or that
hopefully someone else encountered this issue.  I am not saying the
firewall is not totally to blame, but i can see why it is behaving the
way it is when seeing tons of connections from the same udp ip/port come
in.
thanks again
