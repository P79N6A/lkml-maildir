Aside from loading modules, it also performs the matching between devices 
and drivers - rather than drivers registering a list of the devices they're 
capable of driving, as with other bus types, cardmgr is required to 'bind' 
devices to drivers.
The whole lot wants rewriting. I've been looking at it but don't have 
anything that even compiles.
