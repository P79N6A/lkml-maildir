- Linus has merged ia32 NUMA discontigmem support
+ Added a little cleanup patch from various folks.
Threw in the kichen sink:
+writeback-control.patch
  Infrastructure for richer communication between the block layer
  and the VM.
+queue-congestion.patch
  Infrastructure for non-blocking writeout in the block layer.
+nonblocking-pdflush.patch
  Non-blocking background writeback
+nonblocking-vm.patch
  Non-blocking page reclaim.
This is all about reducing latency when the machine is performing heavy
writeback, which has been a significant performance problem for ever.
The code also happens to provide improved scalability in many-spindle
pagecache writeback.
The code is stable, but by no means complete.  Under some loads it will
chew tons of CPU in page reclaim.
But with mem=512m and four instances of `dbench 100' each against a
different disk the machine was 100% responsive and ran a `make -j6
bzImage' in three minutes.  Without these patches the kernel took over
five minutes just to unpack the kernel tarball.
