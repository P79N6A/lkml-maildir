So, to take a specific example (incidentally the one I am
personally interested in):
isdn4linux (CONFIG_ISDN_I4L), currently marked as "obsolete"
(which is undoubtedly incorrect), would not even qualify as
"deprecated" as long as its successor, the CAPI 2.0 subsystem
(CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI) doesn't support all the hardware currently
supported by old i4l.
Or did I misunderstand something there?
Thanks,
Tilman
