It's easy enough to change which order things get stopped/started in. What
matters more is the conceptual shift in responsibility for who
stops/starts the devices, or rather their interfaces.
It also requires a mapping from struct device -> struct class_device that
the drivers will have to initialize.

It's saved in dev->power.pm_resume, so drivers can check it.

The driver core calls it in device_power_down() (as was in the patch ;),
in physical topological order. The ordering of the calls is up the power
management core, but it just wouldn't make sense to power down a device
that wasn't stopped. Would be easy enough to add a check for it..
Note it would make sense to power down a device without stopping, if the
device had no device driver bound to it (e.g. unclaimed devices that are
in D0 unnecessarily; or unclaimed devices that need to be powered down
during a suspend transition).

Policy can come later; we have to have a working model first.
As far as partial trees go, it can be done using the posted patch.  Think
about why you want to suspend/resume a partial tree - to use a particular
leaf device. You know what device it is, and by virtue of the driver
model, you know each of its ancestors. So, you walk the tree up to the
root, and restart all the way down. Then, you re-stop it all the way back
up. Should be ~10 lines of code that is left as an exercise against the
posted patch. :)
