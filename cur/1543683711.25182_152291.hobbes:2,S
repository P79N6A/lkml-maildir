I think I've found the problem. It is due to us overwriting
req->rq_rcv_buf in call_encode() while the RPC request is still on the
list waiting for a reply from the server.
Actually, this *is* likely to be an issue on 2.4.x too, but as it is
also going to be very timing related, you are probably being lucky in
one case, and not the other.
I'll draw up a patch some time in the next 24 hours...
Cheers,
  Trond
