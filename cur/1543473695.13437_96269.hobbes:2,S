I have a character device driver.  I have a test program that opens the
driver twice, obtaining two file descriptors for the same file.  Under
2.0.36 I see the following counts in my open routine:
1st open:    f_count=1 i_count=1
2nd open:    f_count=1 i_count=2
Under 2.2.0 I see the following counts:
1st open:    f_count=1 i_count=1 d_count=1
2nd open:    f_count=1 i_count=1 d_count=2
Notice that in 2.2 the d_count in the dentry struct increases but the
i_count in the inode structure does not.
Is this intentional?  If my driver close routine pays attention to
i_count == 1 in 2.0.36 is it intended that it should use d_count == 1 in
2.2 instead?  Or is this just a bug?
Thanks,
Dave
