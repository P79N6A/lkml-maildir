   I'd like to eliminate lots of the magic weird cases in Config.in too - but
   by making the language express it. Something like
   
   tristate_orif "blah" CONFIG_FOO $CONFIG_SMALL
   
This doesn't solve the CRC32 case.  What if you want
CONFIG_SMALL, yet some net driver that needs the crc32
routines?
