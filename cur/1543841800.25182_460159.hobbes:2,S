I'm able to duplicate this now.
My mistake, my exports had the no_root_squash attribute set.
Without it I get the permission denied and no mount.
Looking through the git-nfs patch I can't see how this would have
changed, returning EPERM, perhaps before it gets to the EEXIST check.
Anyone else have any idea why this may has changed.
