And what contribution to achieving the goal of having a single namespace
does the above comment provide?
Look, this is what I'm complaining about.  There's lots of talk on this
issue.  There's been lots and lots of talk on this issue in the past as
well.  I've raised the technical issues in this thread several times and
so far been ignored every time.
If as much effort went into trying to resolve the technical problems as
has gone into whinging about it in this thread, maybe the goal would be
a little closer?
I'm sorry if you find this message offensive.  I find filling my mailbox
with 80ish messages of whinging utterly unproductive and equally offensive
especially given my past input on serial issues.
