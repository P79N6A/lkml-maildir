right now my first cautious estimation seems to be that we might be able 
to get rid of this whole child/parent timeslice sharing complexity and 
do all the scheduling setup without affecting the parent - hence 
avoiding all the reaper problems as well. People reported interactivity 
improvements with this removed from CFS. (It all still needs a ton of 
validation to make sure, but the trend seems to be this.)
(the only valid component of that complexity is 'child runs first' - but 
it's not really related to the timesplice splitting thing just 
intermixed with it.)
