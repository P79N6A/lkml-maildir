You never need to rebance the bigmem between 1g and 64g withing kswapd.
This because bh/irq handlers are not going to use it. So kswapd has to
care only about the memory below the bigmem boundary.
BTW I just noticed currently (2.3.40pre1) kswapd is completly
screwedup. kswapd should still do:
		while (nr_free_pages - nr_free_bigpages < freepages.high)
exactly like in our early 2.3.18 bigmem code because _nothing_ is changed
is the basic MM design since that time.
The fix against 2.3.40pre1 to re-activate kswapd is this:
