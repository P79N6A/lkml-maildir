I think, "Solved it" because I changed the source code.
LANDISK have two LED.
One is power-led. The other is status-led.
Power-led and status-led can respectively set "hard", and it operates normally.
'echo "hard" >  /sys/class/leds/power/triggers'
It works. Power-led behaves as always lights.
Power-led is controlled with hardware based on specific logic (CPLD) in LANDISK.
'echo "hard" >  /sys/class/leds/status/triggers'
It works too. Status-LED behaves as HDD-access-LED.
Status-led is controlled with hardware based on specific logic (CPLD) in LANDISK too.
