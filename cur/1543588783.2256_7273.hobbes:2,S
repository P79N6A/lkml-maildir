   You have already posted this very same message to
        linux-net@vger.kernel.org
   and:
        netdev@oss.sgi.com
   lists.  If you don't get reply from those (netdev mainly), the
   linux-kernel is not going to yield cheers either.
   People that know the networking code intimately are presently
   "somewhat" busy,   Be patient, repeat this topic at  netdev
   list after about a week.

        TCP Timestamps ?
        (Which Linux does use if the other end supports them too.)
        Of course, what is "rate" ?  Units of something per units
	of time ?  Packets ?  Payload bytes ?   How does the size
        of payload data in the packets affect the "rate" ?
