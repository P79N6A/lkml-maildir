I guess my problem (and not only mine it seems) is here:
md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.
md: autorun ...
md: ... autorun DONE.
md: Loading md_d0: /dev/hda
md: bind<hda>
md: bind<sda>
raid1: raid set md_d0 active with 2 out of 2 mirrors
 md_d0: unknown partition table
Why the unknown partition table? It does work fine once I complete booting.
This is with 2.6.7.
Don't pay attention to the hda,sda -- I was using vmware for the tests.
Sorry if I break the thread, but I had trouble finding the proper message to
reply to.
