Sorry Jeff, but that's crap.  Go look at the commits list.  Every single
patch which has gone into the tree for the past two weeks is a bugfix, I
think.
The most recent non-fix I see is
ChangeSet 1.2044, 2005/02/22 20:44:37-05:00, romieu@fr.zoreil.com
 	[PATCH] r8169: removal of unused #define
 	Removal of unused #define
 	Signed-off-by: Jon Mason <jdmason@us.ibm.com>
 	Signed-off-by: Francois Romieu <romieu@fr.zoreil.com>
 	Signed-off-by: Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com>
So pphhhfftt ;)
And the most recent non-trivial not-completely-a-bugfix patch I see
is "USB: Add ioctls to ub", from Feb 17.  And even that's an outlier.
