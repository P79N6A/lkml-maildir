A quick question here regarding the possibility of one logical change
for all of drivers/. Does that hold true for *any* logical change?
Intuitively, I would say no. My biggest concern with that is there are
many Maintainers listed for particular SCSI drivers, e.g., as well as
one for the SCSI subsystem. If those individual driver maintainers'
files are being modified, should they be CC'ed, or is the big patch
just sent to the SCSI maintainer (in this example)? I just want to
make sure the correct patch-chain is respected.
There is already a patch pending for the KJ FAQ from Domen Puncer
(
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/kernel-janitors/2005-July/004438.html
)
to note that the same logical change can be made for all of
drivers/net, e.g., in one patch, but it's still not quite clear how
the appropriate CCs should be respected. We should probably make that
as clear as possible now.
Thanks,
Nish
