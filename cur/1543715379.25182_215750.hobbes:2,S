Are you using ATI's proprietary drivers?  I have also experienced this 
sort of system hang when using their drivers.  When I would exit the X 
server, I would get a screen full of vertical lines and the system would 
be completely dead (could not ping).
The short-term solutions are either to use the XFree's native drivers or 
to use vesafb for the console.  The long term solution is for ATI to fix 
their drivers.
