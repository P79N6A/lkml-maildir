I just noticed yesterday that there is something wrong with acpi on this
board, which I had running. However it didnt list an irq for the serial
when acpi was enabled, and running with a serial console it hung when
acpi tunred on (with no messages to the serial console, unhelpfully). The
same is probably happening with the scsi card. Havent looked into why.
You can get temperatures with lm_sensors. I think the module is it87 if I
remember correctly.
