Hi all,
i wonder about the Kernel naming convention in the merge phase before
the -rc1 is officially tagged by Linus.
Won't it be more precisely to name the current snapshot
2.6.26-merge-git16 instead of 2.6.25-git16?
It is not that i would suggest to have a new git tag in this merge phase 
but only the Makefile should be changed at the beginning of this phase 
to identify the ongoing work for the 2.6.26:
------
diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index d3634cd..b8c85a4 100644
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile
@@ -1,8 +1,8 @@
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
-SUBLEVEL = 25
-EXTRAVERSION =
-NAME = Funky Weasel is Jiggy wit it
+SUBLEVEL = 26
+EXTRAVERSION = -merge
+NAME = unnamed
# *DOCUMENTATION*
# To see a list of typical targets execute "make help"
------
Introducing the new '-merge' version _that_ early helps to avoid the 
version confusion in /lib/modules and also allows people to work with 
kernel version depended stuff in a very early phase.
Regards,
Oliver
