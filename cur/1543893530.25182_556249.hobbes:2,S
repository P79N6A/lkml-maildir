We will do AHCI link PM -- presuming that I can be convinced that it 
does not repeatedly park the hard drive heads, or something similarly 
annoying on PATA<->SATA bridges and similar setups.
IF it works as advertised -- a big if considering all the AHCI silicon 
implementations out there -- we definitely want to use it.
