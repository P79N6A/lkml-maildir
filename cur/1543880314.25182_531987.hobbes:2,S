Subject: [PATCH 11/11] Char: cyclades, allow DEBUG_SHIRQ
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

cyclades, allow DEBUG_SHIRQ
Test if base addr is non-null in ISR to prove the card has been correctly
initialized. This is needed for DEBUG_SHIRQ for example.
