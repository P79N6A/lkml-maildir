Only that it doesn't work either today. Kernel stays at 2.6.14-rc1 as of
yesterday (latest were a few NTFS patches), everything up to date.
BTW, the cogito repository is hosed, cg-update can't get needed object
69ba00668be16e44cae699098694286f703ec61d. Fetching the contents by rsync
gives the same mess.
