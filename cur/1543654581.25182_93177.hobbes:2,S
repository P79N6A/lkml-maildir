I hadn't realised that was an AGP 3.0 chip. Its likely that we'll
need to change things to use different routines than the generic
ones if this is the case.  If it is the case, then it shouldn't be too
hard to figure out what to change, as long as VIA have the specs
available.. I'll dig around when I get back on Monday.
