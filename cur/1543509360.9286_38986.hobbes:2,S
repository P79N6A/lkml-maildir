hi,
 i am working on NFS version3 on linux . I am testing my client with a sun
machine
nfs server. I get an error 
  when i do an GETATTR call
	GETATTR call failed:: RPC: Authentication error; why = Client
credential too weak
Could anybody help me out? this should not happen -- i am using a generic
client call. 
thanks
harish
