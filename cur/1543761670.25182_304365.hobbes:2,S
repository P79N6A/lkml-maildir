That may be related to the new mix of USER_HZ. I can't really tell, 
just observed that there is such.

Yes, I know. Linus threw it out during 2.5 because it was deemed to buggy.
That did not affect me, because that busywaiting is only possible in 
!SCHED_OTHER, which I cannot use, because tiny delays are needed in a 
user-runnable userspace app, and I don't want it suid and stuff.
(I've developed an "overhead correction" for accurate(*) realtime replay of 
logfiles. (*) with respect to the total runtime. Works well.)
>You can spin on the gettimeofday() result in userspace.
How can I use it? / What does it help me? I just have the gettimeofday() in 
the example script to measure the total time of nanosleep(). Sometimes, 
nanosleep completes in the same tick, sometimes (95%), another task is 
scheduled before returning. I am calling nanosleep repetedly to find out the 
_average_ time for a 0us-nanosleep(), usually 100/1000 us.
