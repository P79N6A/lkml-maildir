I'm rather reluctant to advocate the broadcast scheme as i can see it 
breaking on a lot of systems, e.g. SMP systems which use i8259 (as you 
noted), IBM x440 and ES7000. If anything the default mode should be APIC 
timer and have a parameter to disable it. Regarding things like variable 
timer ticks, reprogramming the PIT is slow, and using it extensively for 
such sounds like a step in the wrong direction. Is this feature/bug going 
to proliferate amongst newer processor local APICs?
