Subject: [PATCH] - Move cpu_vm_mask to be closer to mmu_context_t in struct mm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The cpu_vm_mask use to be close to the mmu_context_t field
in the mm struct. Recently some large members were
added between "cpu_vm_mask" and "context". I suspect that
was an oversight. 
Here is a patch that puts the fields close together. This
makes it likely that both fields are in the same cache line. 
Since both fields are likely to be updated at the same 
time, this may improve performance.
