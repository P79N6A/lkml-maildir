The raid resync speed min and max are governed by the linux raid 
subsystem, I do not remember how to tweak them off hand and it's isn't in 
the software raid howto.

Generally the maximum throughput for a pci controller is a bit less than 
the theoretical limit. some if not most motherboard implementations these 
days have the south brdiges sata ports attached to something other than 
the pci bus... This will get even more important in the context of 
sataII. pci-x or pci express sata controllers help quite a bit as 
well for machines that need more ports. Even some of the lower-end promise 
cards will run in a 66mhz slot these days though it's sort of wasteful to 
toss a 32bit card in a pci-x slot.

Those are measuring the performance of the linux buffer cache without disk 
access. really this a benchmark of the processor and memory of the system 
not the disk. -t meuse speed through the buffer without caching, which 
might give you a ballpark indication of disk speed. Really you need to use 
something like iozone to get a sense of how fast a disk is.
on the laptop I'm sending the mail on...
[root@podocarpus-totara joelja]# hdparm -T /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
  Timing cached reads:   2480 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1240.19 MB/sec
[root@podocarpus-totara joelja]# hdparm -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
  Timing buffered disk reads:   90 MB in  3.04 seconds =  29.60 MB/sec
30MB/s is pretty fast for a laptop, but it is a 100GB 5400rpm drive so 
it's probablly a little faster than what I'm used to.
