You are pushing this down to the file system.  I'd venture too say that 
this will majorly stress the fs code, make its indexing slower and 
majorly fragment the file on disk (if it's later overwritten).  Sure - you 
have less work to do (less to code) - but the end effect might be 
painful, especially on often written files (if the file ain't written to 
then there are much better compression solutions).
Cheers,
MaZe.
