All of the volatile/atomic, C99, typedef, data format, return format,
u64/32/16/etc, are all addressed and fixed in the latest patches.  The
dump_bp() is removed for now, to be considered later if/when it makes
sense.
We'd want to keep the ioctl() interface, given the number of programs
using it across multiple platforms (and is being considered for
multiple OSes).  DUMP_MAJOR has changed to CRASH_DUMP_MAJOR and is
now standard in major.h.  Finally, the MAINTAINERS and Config.help
files are updated.
We're correcting a few more issues with the mem_map[], page_is_ram(),
etc., usage, but those shouldn't take long.
If anyone needs a preliminary patch this morning, let me know.

P.S.  Pete, we can go through the dump_bp() stuff on the mailing list.
