Yep!!!
Add the following:
o	Add a size variable for each of the tables.  It works best
	if the per-table state is stored with the table itself, for
	example:
	struct hashtbl {
		int size;
		int fvl;
		struct hash_param params;
		struct list_head buckets[0];
	};
o	When switching tables, allocate a new one of the desired size
	and free up the non-current one.  (But remember to wait at least
	one grace period after the last switch before starting this!!!)
o	Compute hash parameters suitable for the new table size.
o	Continue as before.
Note that you are not restricted to power-of-two expansion -- the
hash parameters should handle any desired difference, and in fact
handle contraction as well as expansion.
						Thanx, Paul
