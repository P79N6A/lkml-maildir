I am not happy with udev as it is currently; I am not happy with devfs crashing; I will continue to do what I can as time permits.
I do not neccessarily need devfs - but udev lacks two features I need and I do not see any way to add them without creatign the same sort of problems as devfs has.

no way. this requires far deeper devfs integration that is currently available. there was code that did it for removable media; it was removed during 2.5 series. fixing bugs in devfs is one thing; reintegrating it into kernel is another.
basically devfs in 2.6 is reduced to
mknod from within drivers
devfsd notification on lookup

I must admit I never used devfs names myself so it proved rather useless to me even in 2.4 times.
