Well, I tried 2.4.19-pre3 yesterday (Alpha with an IDE drive) and
my ext2 file system is indeed gone.  I do not want to claim that this
is certainly due to an IDE driver from 2.4.19-pre3, as this is
a machine with a number still open issues and very experimental
installation, but it survived a number of very rough attempts on
file systems in the past and now it died.  This _could be_ coincidental;
I did use various kernels from "ac" series on it in the past.
BTW  - e2fsck made an impression that it is running in circles.
After mounting a disk from another system I have leftovers and number
of files can be read and copied but, among other things, '/lib' is
not a directory anymore. :-)
