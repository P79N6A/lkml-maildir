Interesting.  There's been on-and-off discussion for some time
as to whether the default mkfs parameters should be changed,
this will add more fuel to that debate I expect.
I'm curious why you went to 2K inodes instead of 512 - I guess
because thats the largest inode size with a 4K blocksize?  If
the defaults were changed, I expect it would be to switch over
to 512 byte inodes - do you have numbers for that?

Ah great, thanks, I'll be keen to try that when its available.
cheers.
