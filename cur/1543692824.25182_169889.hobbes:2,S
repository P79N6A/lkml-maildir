How about just putting it in "gid16.c" and then adding a CONFIG_GID16
config variable. Then architectures that want it (pretty much all, no?)  
can then obviously just do the
	config GID16
		bool
		default y
in their Kconfig files and be happy. Add the obvious
	obj-$(CONFIG_GID16) += gid16.o
to the kernel makefile and you're done. Looks surgically clean, and 
follows existing practice wrt uid16.
Ok?
