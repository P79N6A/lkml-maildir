Yes. But now let us read the Large Disk HOWTO:
-------------------------------------------------------------
If the Linux kernel detects the presence of some disk manager
on an IDE disk, it will try to remap the disk in the same way
this disk manager would have done, so that Linux sees the same
disk partitioning as for example DOS with OnTrack or EZ-Drive.
However, NO remapping is done when a geometry was specified
on the command line
-------------------------------------------------------------
(The details are a bit dependent upon kernel version.
This was written for 2.0.*. If you are running 2.3.*
and have problems, come back and I can explain the 2.3.* details.)
