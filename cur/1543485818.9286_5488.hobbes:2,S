Correct.

Correct.  That would be dumb, so we don't do it.

Also correct.

Here I disagree.  You can serialize these quite effectively.  Have one
thread per filesystem (anything more will just make the disk heads thrash)
plus a request queue of a few inodes' worth on each of those threads.
When the last reference to a file is lost, send a message to the cleanup
thread and if there is still free space in that thread's queue, unblock
the unlink() call, otherwise block the unlink() call (you'd have to wait
anyway).
So it's obviously possible to get this in kernel space.  Now answer the
question "Why?".  I think everyone else who replied to this did that quite
effectively--it's kernel bloat that can't already be done in user space.
