Greg,
   to implement the AA approach useing SELinux you need to have a way that 
files that are renamed or created get tagged with the right label 
automaticaly with no possible race condition.
If this can be done then it _may_ be possible to do the job that AA is 
aimed at with SELinux, but the work nessasary to figure out what lables 
are needed on what file would still make it a non-trivial task.
as I understand it SELinux puts one label on each file, so if you have 
three files accessed by two programs such that
program A accesses files X Y
program B accesses files Y Z
then files X Y and Z all need seperate labels with the policy stateing 
that program A need to access labels X, Y and program B needs to access 
files Y Z
extended out this can come close to giving each file it's own label. AA 
essentially does this and calls the label the path and computes it at 
runtime instead of storing it somewhere.
