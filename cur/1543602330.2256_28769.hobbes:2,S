Not true.  ext2, ext3 in its "data=writeback" mode, and reiserfs can
all demonstrate this behaviour.  Reiserfs is being no worse than ext2
(the timings may make the race more or less likely in reiserfs, but
ext2 _is_ vulnerable.)
e2fsck only restores metadata consistency on ext2 after a crash: it
can't possibly guarantee that all the data blocks have been written.
ext3 will let you do full data journaling, but also has a third mode
(the default), which doesn't journal data, but which does make sure
that data is flushed to disk before the transaction which allocated
that data is allowed to commit.  That gives you most of the
performance of ext3's fast-and-loose writeback mode, but with an
absolute guarantee that you never see stale blocks in a file after a
crash.
Cheers,
 Stephen
