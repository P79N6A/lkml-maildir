The device ID you added (0x4351) is already claimed by the new sky2 driver.
Unless theres a mistake in sky2's device table, your laptop contains a 
Yukon-II adapter which is incompatible with the original Yukon chips (skge = 
Yukon, sky2 = Yukon-II).
On the other hand, I believe Stephen could do with some extra sky2 testing :)
You can find it in the latest -mm releases.
