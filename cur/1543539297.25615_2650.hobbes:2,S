Hi!
  I fixed a bug in the console system which uncovered a unknown bug in
the a few X servers :-( It appears these X servers don't bother to
reset the color palette correctly when VC switching to a text console. The
problem various with different video cards. For the NVIDIA X server it doesn't
reset the gamma ramp. Instead everytime you VT switch the screen gets
darker and darker. Just to make sure I have spent the day downloading the
XFree86 CVS [all 230 Megs :-(] and will go threw the code tonight to find
the problem. I also have several video cards and XFree86 3.3.6 so I will
be doing alot of testing with different combos with 2.4.0-test4. The
console fix is right and the X servers have the bug. 
Has anyone tried the NVIDIA 4.01 X server with the nvidia fbdev driver
and seen this same problem? 
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
