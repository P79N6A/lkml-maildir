           Summary: psmouse.c fails detecting Microsoft PS/2 wheel mice
    Kernel Version: 2.5.65
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: vojtech@suse.cz
         Submitter: idan@idanso.dyndns.org
Distribution: Debian unstable(sid)
Hardware Environment:  PIII I815e board, microsoft ps/2 whell mouse(IntelliMouse
1.1A)
Software Environment: GPM/XFree 4.2
Problem Description:
Mouse is not detected either built-in or as a module(No notice in dmesg or
whatsoever, XFree/GPM have no interaction with the mouse).
I did however managed to track where the problem comes from, appearently one of
the tests at psmouse_probe() fails for some reason:
/*
 * Then we reset and disable the mouse so that it doesn't generate events.
 */
      if (psmouse_command(psmouse, NULL, PSMOUSE_CMD_RESET_DIS))
              return -1;
Commenting it out solved the problem for me and the mouse is detected and
working flawlessly.
