I have repeatedly offered to fix the aic7xxx and aicasm makefiles but
you have refused to let me.  See the thread that ended in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=99353014629653&w=2
You have hit the precise problem that I raised in that thread, you
cannot rely on timestamps for files that are both generated and
shipped.  aic7xxx is not the only system that has this problems but
other maintainers accept that I know the kbuild system better than they
do.  I have fixed the problem in kbuild 2.5 for all generated files
_except_ for aic7xxx.  Until you accept that your makefiles are
incorrect and do not fit the Linux kernel build model, I have no
intention of doing any more work on aic7xxx.
