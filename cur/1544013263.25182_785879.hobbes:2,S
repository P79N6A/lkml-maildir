Hi Roel,
I'm not sure this is the right fix.
If you look at t_next, if there is no more page to look at,
iter_idx takes -1.
A 0 value would mean: we are in the first index on the page, which means
there is something to read and we don't want to return NULL.
I guess that would be better to turn idx into a signed int.
