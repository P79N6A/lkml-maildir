   Ok I got home and here are more details:
System: K6-233 , memory bus clocked at 66mhz.   
 Sym-810a controller, ide disk. 
 Problem: trying to read long files from cd-rw (Yamaha 4416s) fails:
ncr53c810a-0-<3,0>: extraneous data discarded.
ncr53c810a-0-<3,0>: COMMAND FAILED (89 0) @c0004020.
scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
ncr53c8xx_reset: pid=55445 reset_flags=1 serial_number=0
serial_number_at_timeout=0
scsi0: device driver called scsi_done() for a syncronous reset.
ncr53c810a-0: restart (scsi reset).
ncr53c810a-0-<3,*>: asynchronous.
sr0: CD-ROM not ready.  Make sure you have a disc in the drive.
CD-ROM I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 272580
Device not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.
This is on a fourth attempt to read 250Mb from a disk. Previous ones
produced different results in md5sum.
kernel 2.2.9, compiled with egcs-2.91.60.
The recording is going ok though.
I still suspect that the fact that scsi adapter does not have active
termination plays a role.

PS I know of the patch posted here earlier but it is for scsi disks and
this is cdrom.
