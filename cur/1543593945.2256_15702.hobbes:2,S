I know there's a driver for this floating around (I found mine through
search dell.com's pages), and I wondering if this is a driver that is in the
"testing phase" before it's going into the kernel, or if it's just a driver
provided by Dell?  The driver I found, was both pre-compiled as a module,
and given as source code. The only problem is that I can't get the
pre-compiled version to work on other things than std. redhat 7.x kernel
(ie. std. kernel when you install redhat, that is).  I can't get the source
code to compile either.
So, to sum up; 
* Are there anyone testing/maintaing this driver, trying to get it into the
  standard kernel source?
* If not, would it be rude for me to make it work with the latest kernels,
  and then submitt it? (I won't take credit for anything I haven't done, but
  since I haven't written the driver itself, I don't know what you guys think)
