Josh and others should take a look at Plan9's venti file storage method 
-- archival storage is a series of unordered blocks, all of which are 
indexed by the sha1 hash of their contents.  This magically coalesces 
all duplicate blocks by its very nature, including the loooooong runs of 
zeroes that you'll find in many filesystems.  I bet savings on "all 
bytes in this block are zero" are worth a bunch right there.
