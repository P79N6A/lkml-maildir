 IMHO, it would be better to coerce whatever bus to follow common
driver-model synchronization/attach/detach rules and be able to do
straight-forward implementation of features in the core driver-model.
If the current driver-model isn't enough, the core code should be
expanded rather than doing bus-specific dances in individual buses.
But I don't really know about any bus other than PCI, so maybe I'm
being too naive.

 I think above can be cleanly solved by enforcing that no device can
be attached to a driver unless all its ancestors are attached to a
driver.  The check can be made easiliy inside the driver-model, and,
if needed, making dummy drivers for internal node devices which
orignally didn't need one shouldn't be difficult.  We can just return
-EBUSY for any attempts to detach an internal device which has
driver-attached children.  This way, recursing and all other chores
can be dumped to user-space where they belong.
 And regarding the duplicate works, my work on manual-attach was
primarily to show how dynamic device-driver binding can work with
devparam; also, Dmitry seems to understand the problem better than me.
So, I think I should back off on manualattach.  Dmitry, what do you
think about integrating devparam with your work?
 Thanks.
