I think you're misunderstanding the workqueue code?  You can call 
schedule_work(&sdev->event_work) from anywhere, any time you like, as 
many times as you like.

Quite agreed that sdev_evt_notify() might be called from kernel daemons, 
but in general this is a fire-and-forget API that is -likely- to be 
called from interrupt or completion context of many drivers, just like 
scsi_done or other completion APIs.  It is a fundamentally parallel 
interface.
If thread-backed kernel daemons want to use this, it is trivial for them 
to schedule work, then sync.
