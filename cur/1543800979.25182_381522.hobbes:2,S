Subject: variable used before set
Hello there,
I just tried to compile the Linux Kernel version 2.6.11.12
with the most excellent Intel C compiler. It said
drivers/scsi/pcmcia/aha152x_stub.c(313): remark #592: variable "tmp" is used 
before its value is set
       tmp.device->host = info->host;
       ^
This is clearly broken code, since the field tmp.device has not been
initialised, and so isn't pointing to anything.
Suggest code rework.
