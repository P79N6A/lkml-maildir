    Hi Mark :)
>So what's the "right way" to do it?
    AFAIK, the for loop, with getdtablesize() instead of 'OPEN_MAX'.
I do it that way, but I don't really know if it is the 'right way'(tm).

    The array should be allocated by the kernel, or the syscall won't
work as expected ;) If you have 2000 fd open and the array whose
address you pass to the ioctl has an smaller size... Anyway, you can
call the ioctl a few times ;)
    Your proposal seems reasonable (unless there is any other way of
doing this portably), but portability will be an issue...
