No, the cs89x0 can be used on systems that don't have an ISA bus at
all. It just needs 16 data lines, a couple of address lines and some
selection lines, but that's all. It's very nice for embedded designs
because it's a single chip solution. Add a 20MHz crystal, a
transformer, and a connector and you're set.
OK, what about this patch. As far as I know, the cs89x0 is only used on
Intel SA11x0 and Cirrus PS7500FE platforms in the ARM world (Russell,
please correct me if I'm wrong). This patch make it dependent on
CONFIG_ISA, CONFIG_ARCH_SA1100, or CONFIG_ARCH_CLPS7500.
