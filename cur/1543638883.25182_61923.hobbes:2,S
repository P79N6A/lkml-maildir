You look from the IDE perspective, I look from the interface
perspective. There's is no "eat one request" semantic of request_fn(),
in fact there's just the opposite. If you quit after having just
consumed one request, you must make sure to invoke request_fn _yourself_
later on -- or use the recent blk_start/stop_queue helpers.
