This looks like an inetd configure problem. Make sure you use the
right combination of flags and wait mode. E.g. for pidentd you should
either have
ident   stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/identd identd -i
                        ^^^^^^                                 ^^^
or
ident   stream  tcp     wait    nobody  /usr/sbin/identd identd -w
                        ^^^^                                   ^^^
in /etc/inetd.conf. Also make sure you don't have both an ident line
in inetd.conf and a standalone identd running (e.g. /etc/init.d/identd).
