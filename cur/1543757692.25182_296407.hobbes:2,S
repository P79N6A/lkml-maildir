I am surprised too. Jens says "ub effectively disables merging by setting
max hw/phys segment limit of 1." But surely this ought not to be a problem
for reads within the same page.

Thank you for the tip. This works fine, 4KB I/O is restored for dd.
However, I still have this problem with people who use ub to read CF sticks
from their cameras, mounted as FAT or VFAT. I verified that the effect of
this ioctl disappears at mount time, just as you said.
I'll think what I can do about it.
