I'd have to check what callers expect from disable_local_APIC(), but
having it or a new function do a complete disable seems reasonable.
detect_init_APIC() needs to record whether it did a hard enable via
APIC_BASE or not, and the complete-disable code needs to check this
before accessing APIC_BASE. That + a cpu_has_apic check should do it.
I'll do a patch this evening if no-one else beats me to it.
