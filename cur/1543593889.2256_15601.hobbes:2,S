Hey, you don't have a pirq table, no wonder Linux cannot find the
information.
It's probably an ACPI-only system - rather uncommon, but I bet it will
become fairly common especially in laptops with WindowsME and higher only.
There's a ACPI dump utility in the ACPI tools, that might give people some
idea on what's up. Right now Linux ACPI only does irq routing on ia64, if
I remember correctly, so ACPI per se won't fix the problem, but it would
definitely be the next thing to look at.
Oh, well..
