We haven't heard from them.  I have written email to them a few
times (2 or 3), but they haven't replied.
The current PC-9800 implementation is only 1/2 done, and IDE
is very hackish, according to Bart.
And currently X86_PC9800 cannot be selected at all (it's not
there!), so people cannot attempt to build/fix it either
(without fixing that, which I have done, but I don't think it's
worth submitting that patch).
