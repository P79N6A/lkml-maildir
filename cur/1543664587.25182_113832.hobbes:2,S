While people would certainly use it, I can't help but think that a BK 
clone would damage other open source SCM efforts.  I call this the 
"SourceForge Syndrome":
	Q. I found a problem/bug/annoyance, how do I solve it?
	A. Clearly, a brand new sourceforge project is called for.
My counter-question is, why not improve an _existing_ open source SCM to 
read and write BitKeeper files?  Why do we need yet another brand new 
project?
AFAICS, a BK clone would just further divide resources and mindshare.  I 
personally _want_ an open source SCM that is as good as, or better, than 
BitKeeper.  The open source world needs that, and BitKeeper needs the 
competition.  A BK clone may work with BitKeeper files, but I don't see 
it ever being as good as BK, because it will always be playing catch-up.
