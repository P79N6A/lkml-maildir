Unfortunately, this is all quite platform specific and the ethernet
driver may be the only one to know what to do here... add to that
various special cases of the way the PHY is wired or controlled, I think
we can't completely avoid special casing...

The ethernet driver can instanciate the PHYs at it's childs, though the
case of several MACs sharing PHYs will be difficult to represent...

I would have them instanciated by the ethernet driver. Besides, the PHY
driver will need to be able to identify it's "parent" driver in some
ways to deal with special cases. It would be nice to have a library of
utility code to independently deal with link tracking (basically what
drivers like sungem do independently), with a callback to the ethernet
driver to inform it of actual changes (notifier ?). MACs often have
autopoll features and PHY often have interrupts, but from experience,
that's not very useful and a good old timer based polling tend to do a
better job most of the time.

I'd put all bcm5xxx in the same file ... they can be put together by
families...
