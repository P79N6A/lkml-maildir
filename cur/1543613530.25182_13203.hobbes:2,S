Thank you for this correction of my understanding of /var
I now am under the impression that it merely means that /var must be mounted 
rw. It is for variables, but not discardable data.
This still means that the concept of a tmpfs /var is _severely_ broken. DON'T 
DO IT.
I may be wrong about /tmp as well, but I have come to think that it is data 
that ought be discarded after logout, and have sometimes considered writing a 
script for it in the login/logout scripts.

   Once I swore I would die for you, but I never meant like this.
