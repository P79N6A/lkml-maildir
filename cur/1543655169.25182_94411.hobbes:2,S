Something must have gone wrong here.  rl2 cannot be worse than
2.4.20 in this test.
Umm, quick sanity check:
2.4.20-rl2      321.44  147%    96      24%
2.4.20          361.70  130%    108     24%
So only a 10% speedup, but certainly not a 50% slowdown.  (That is
on scsi).
Maybe a patch preparation problem?
