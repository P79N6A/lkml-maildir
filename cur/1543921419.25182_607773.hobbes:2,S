Subject: [PATCH 1/2] UUID: set multicast bit in pseudo-random MAC address
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/20/153

Fix a bug in the current random UUID generator:
Section 4.1.6 of RFC 4122 states regarding the "NodeID" of a UUID:
:  For systems with no IEEE address, a randomly or pseudo-randomly
:  generated value may be used; see Section 4.5.  The multicast bit must
:  be set in such addresses, in order that they will never conflict with
:  addresses obtained from network cards. 
So up to now it was just pure ("random") luck if this bit was set or not.
This tiny patch sets the bit explicitely.
