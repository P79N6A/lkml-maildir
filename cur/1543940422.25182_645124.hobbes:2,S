I just found this thread and it looks like it will fix my problem too.  I have an IDE cd-rw drive and 2 SCSI hard drives.  My ide cd-rw drive hasn't been showing up.  I looked at setting scsi cdrom support (CONFIG_BLOCK_DEV_SR) but it doesn't mention anything about ide drives using libata.
I know the drive is being detecting by looking at dmesg:
ata_piix 0000:00:07.1: version 2.12
scsi1 : ata_piix
scsi2 : ata_piix
ata1: PATA max UDMA/33 cmd 0x1f0 ctl 0x3f6 bmdma 0xffa0 irq 14
ata2: PATA max UDMA/33 cmd 0x170 ctl 0x376 bmdma 0xffa8 irq 15
ata1.00: ATAPI: Memorex 52MAXX 3252AJ1, 4WS2, max UDMA/33
ata1.00: configured for UDMA/33
ata2: port disabled. ignoring.
scsi 1:0:0:0: CD-ROM            Memorex  52MAXX 3252AJ1   4WS2 PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
if this works then it really needs to move and be renamed.  I am compiling with DEV_SR set.
Just my $0.02 but may be worth more or less,
Adam
