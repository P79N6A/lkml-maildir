yes, build with...
CONFIG_ACPI=y
CONFIG_ACPI_BUTTON=y
everything else =n
make oldconfig (which will turn on CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT, INTERPRETER) and
build...
For your system on the acpi=ht blacklist, you'll need acpi=force to
over-ride it.  Note that as ACPI has gotten better, some of the systems
on the blacklist have come off.  acpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net would
be a good place to bring up that issue for a particular platform.
