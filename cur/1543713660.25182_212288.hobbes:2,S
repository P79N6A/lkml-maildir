I tried your diff from codemonkey.org against 2.6.5. witch patch -p1 < 
your.diff in /usr/src/linux. It applied and compiled, but after the reboot, 
testgart failed:
bash-2.05b$ testgart
open: No such file or directory
I reinstalled the nvidia drivers, started X, looked 
into /proc/drivers/nvidia/agp/status: disabled.
Now I did, what I should have done at the first place, dmesg:
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected SiS 746 chipset
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: unable to determine aperture size.
agpgart: agp_backend_initialize() failed.
agpgart-sis: probe of 0000:00:00.0 failed with error -22
I am rebooting after the mail back to 2.6.5-rc3 with the 'old' patches from 
last week, because even 2D is real slow now...
Glück Auf,
Volker
