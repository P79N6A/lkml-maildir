In that case there is no more need for the random generator to be part of the
kernel; it much better live in userspace.  Checkup the literature about
pseudo random number generators (PRNGs).  There are many different ones
available providing different tradeoffs between quality (randomness,
distribution etc.) of the generated numbers, performance, implementation
cost (hardware!).  One of the fastest low quality solutions are for example
are shift registers, in their simplest incarnation they're so fast that a
kernel implementation would provide significant overhead.
