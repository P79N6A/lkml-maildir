Hello,
I'm trying to setup an HP E60 server to ship tommorow
afternoon to a customer.
I've done that at least 10 times, without a glitch.
I've try one time the normal way: no luck, hanging on
aic7xxx loading.
I've trying the 'expert' way, and I don't know why,
loading the aic7xxx  has been long, but successful,
the system has been setup.
But now, I can't boot the system anymore (neither reinstall):
the aic7xxx driver loads, finds the two onboard controllers,
detects the hard disk, and then hangs.
I've followed the kernel patches from 2.15 to 2.17-pre?
and Allan said problems with aic7xxx were solved. Was it
something like I'm experiencing ? Should I try the latest
2.17pre ? Any clue ?
Thanks a lot for your time,
François Désarménien
