Yes, the kernel is (supposed) to calculate the integral over time of
the memory sizes; user space divides these integrals by elapsed time
to get averages.
To calculate these you need a timestamp for last change, and a set of
counters.
Then code to update all the counters every time one of the sizes
change (otherwise you need a timestamp for each counter) by adding
current_size*(current_time - last_change_time) to each counter.

The fault counters are incorrect anyway --- faults satisfied from the
page cache are counted as major faults, whereas we expect only faults
that sleep for disk I/O to be counted as major faults.

It's unclear what `swaps' are in Linux.  Traditionally, this rusage
field was the number of complete swapouts --- I'm not sure what the
equivalent is when processes are not swapped out holus-bolus, but are
paged gradually.

It's on my list of things to do, if not soon, then I'm hoping for a
summer student to do some of this stuff.
