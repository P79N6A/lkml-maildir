Agreed. I'll see about doing this using a method similar to the X int10 model. 
I don't have access to the specs on anything other than x86, so if someone 
could provide some information to help with the non-x86 side of the code I'd 
be grateful.

Of course. But then there are people who do stupid things like telling the 
BIOS not to provide a shadow copy of the ROM. However that isn't a big 
problem and those people should have their hardware properly configured in 
the first place...

Okay. This is good - exactly what I was thinking would be done anyway.  What 
about cards like the Radeon's with two CRTC's that can run multi-headed off a 
single card?
Apparently the card is booted properly by the BIOS, but the second head 
(either the VGA port, the Composite/TV Out or the DVI) isn't setup properly 
by the BIOS because, apparently, the ROM can't detect the properties of the 
second head in some situations.
However, for situations like that it might be best to have the API open so 
that userspace tools can be used to set those secondary outputs.

Okay. This has me beat - any suggestions on how to manage it?

Yes - problem is that I have not been able to find any decent information on 
vm86/emu86 in order to capitalize on the system call. Might be better to have 
some people specifically working on the userspace stuff while others focuse 
on the in-kernel stuff.

Yes, please. I made the post I did - dumping my immediate thoughts on the 
subject into it - because I was interested in working on this and making some 
contribution to the kernel. I have a feeling I can get the DRM stuff working 
as the backend for the framebuffer drivers and export that API, or something 
slightly different, to userspace for the userspace tools to take advantage 
of.
In this case, I was thinking that the exo-kernel model used in ALSA would be 
the best solution. For that matter, it wouldn't be trivial, but your 
suggestion about modifying Mesa to be the main userspace interface to the 
kernel graphics system has a lot of merit.
One problem is that Mesa is strictly OpenGL, so this would mean there would 
have to be a second library for the 2D stuff. Potential contenders for this 
are abundant, including one windowing system that actually, IIRC, is 
distributed as a kernel patch/module. I would love to leave the 2D stuff 
completely up to userspace, but all modern video cards contain acceleration 
for 2D drawing, so it would probably be best to include that in any userspace 
side of the system.
