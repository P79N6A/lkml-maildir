Please stop the paranoia and have faith.  Where's guarantee you won't be hit 
by a bus today?
If BK migrates to proprietary format everybody will notice and you'll still
have the opportunity to rescue a not too old repository and carry on with
life using whatever alternate SCM you wish.  If such a thing happened Lary

I'm sure.
