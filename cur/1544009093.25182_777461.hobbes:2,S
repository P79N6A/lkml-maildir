I really don't like this one.
So just about every fh_to_dentry() returns NULL for some error case. 
Instead of considering that a problem, maybe it should tell us something.
There is _one_ single caller of that function afaik, why shouldn't we just 
teach the caller that dammit, lots of people want to just return NULL.
It's not like returning NULL doesn't make sense. Quite frankly, I think it 
makes a lot more sense than returning -ESTALE, which is a very unnatural 
error for most filesystems.
So quite frankly, I'd much rather just see the simpler patch. Have 
exportfs handle the case.
Are there other callers?
