Simply assure me that I don't have to scan every line of the CML2 files for
such changes, and that you'll make a reasonable effort to make the first set
of CML2 rules match the existing CML1 behaviour, without introducing any
controversial changes.
Submit the stuff you know is less popular, like hiding options without help 
text, later - and we can argue about them at the time.
