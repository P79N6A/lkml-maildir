For the bss that sounds correct.

Currently right after compression just before we jump to startup_32.
But if the usage of vmlinux continues to increase we should really
move it to just after startup_32.  Which is where we run into problems
with supporting virtual addresses at our normal kernel entry point.
The relocation doesn't live just after startup_32 now because it is
hard to put there.
The practical challenge is that we need to compute the delta between
where we are at and where we were compiled for, and with possibility of
virtual address and physical address I don't know how we would compute
where we are at, in a way we could compare to our compile time physical
or virtual addresses.
Xen when it comes it at a completely isolated entry point is fine
because there is no pretence of code reuse, and we don't have to auto-detect
how we were started.
