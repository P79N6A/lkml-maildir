Apparently this was solved by applying the specific kernel stuff from
linuxwacom-0.6.4 (
http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net

The curious thing is that the tablet is working flawlessly on 2.6.9-rc2
kernels since before -mm4 (either vanilla or VP).
Just to clear things out, for now.
Sorry for garbage :)
