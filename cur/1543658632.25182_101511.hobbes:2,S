Subject: 2.4.18-14 kernel stuck during ext3 umount with ping still responding

Hi,
I'm running a 2.4.18-14 kernel with a heavy IO profile using ext3 over RAID 
0+1 volumes.
From time to time I get a black screen stuck machine while trying to umount 
a volume during an IO workload (as part of a failback solution - but after 
killing all IO processes ), with ping still responding, but everything else 
mostly dead.
I tried using the forcedumount patch to solve this problem - to no avail. 
Also tried upgrading the qlogic drivers to the latest drivers from Qlogic.
After one of the occurences I managed to get some output using the sysrq 
keys.
This seems similar to what is described in 
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=77508
 but with a 
different call trace
What I have here is what I managed to copy down (for some reason pgup/pgdown 
didn't work so not all information is full...) together with a manual lookup 
of the call trace
from /proc/ksyms :
process umount
EIP c01190b8			(set_running_and_schedule)
call trace:
c01144c9	f25f9ec0	IO_APIC_get_PCI_irq_vector
c010a8b0	f25f9ed0	enable_irq
c014200c	f25f9ef0	fsync_buffers_list
c0155595	f25f9efc	clear_inode
c015553d	f25f9f2c	invalidate_inodes
c01461d8	f25f9f78	get_super
c014a629	f25f9f94	path_release
c0157c58	f25f9fc0	sys_umount
c0108cab			sys_sigaltstack
Any idea what can cause this ?
I'm hoping the ext3fix.patch will solve this problem... am trying that now.
Thanks,
Yuval
