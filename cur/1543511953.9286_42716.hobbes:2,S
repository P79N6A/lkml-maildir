It turns out that for this specific Compaq adapter, the tlan.o module
isn't what is needed. This adapter, as well as the IBM I asked about, are
both OEM's from Intel and use the eepro100.o mod. Fair warning - I tried
the eepro.o mod and the machine hung. Had to boot in single user mode to
fix the conf.modules file!
