Subject: user defined hotplug events?

Hello,
on my notebook, the built in wlan card uses the ipw2100 driver. On boot
time, the ipw2100 module is loaded and fires a hotplug "add" event.
The hotplug event configures the interface and starts wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli.
The ipw2100 chip can be enabled/disabled by a hardware switch, so i 
only enabled it if i need a connection.
Now: even if the wlan hardware is disabled by the switch, wpa_supplicant tries
to get a connection. That's not fine...
The ipw2100 driver exports a switch state file in sysfs, but polling this file is not
fine also.
I want that it works as follows:
A state change of the hardware switch should fire a hotplug event, so that the
wpa_* programs are started if the switch is put on, and killed if the switch is put
off.
The ipw2100 driver already logs a state change of the switch in klog, so adding
a kobject_uevent should not be the major problem. But which KOBJ_* event enum
should be used? KOBJ_ONLINE, KOBJ_OFFLINE ?
Or new, user defined, ones?
Comments? Suggestions?
