Dear All,
   Please give me some idea to play the extracted data from mp3 in real time 
application.
i. e. From the mp3 file i extracted the data to be played alone to my local 
buffer leaving the Frame information of 32 bits.
Then through ioctl() function i wrote the channel, bitrate and Format.
Then through write function i wrote the data captured in the local buffer to 
the dsp device /dev/dsp.
But i am getting only the irregular noise.
Is any uncompression should be done for data and written.
Is so how the uncompression should be done..
with thanks and regards
Senthil
