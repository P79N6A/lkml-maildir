Then anybody can prevent you from removing your obsolete directories
by creating links to them.  Existing hard link don't have
such problems.

This requires fs modifications.  I.e. a new fs

This is trivial but io intensive -  by searching the entire directory 
tree.  Doable in userspace, a nastry DOS opportunity if in the kernel.
Another option is to store pointers to all directory entries
in the inode, but that means much more complicated "mv", "rmdir"
and "mkdir".  Remember, it shouldn't merely "work" but also scale
well on io-intensive SMP machines.  Complicated operations tend
to need more locking in case several processes (on different
processors) try to modify the same directory simultaneously.

Anything is possible, but in this case - why bother?
Do you have a specific use in mind, or is it
just a "cool" thing?  People have thought about directory
links long before linux, tried it, and found other solutions
for their tasks.
