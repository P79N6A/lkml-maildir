After some thought today, I realized the +1 case is not specific to
milliseconds. It's just that it's only being done *correctly* in the
milliseconds case...I think ;)
So, consider the following:
We are requesting a 10 jiffy sleep via
	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule_timeout(10);
Keep in mind that jiffies is only incremented when the timer interrupt
occurs (the whole point being, again, we do not have any inter-tick
jiffy-value).
In schedule_timeout() we will add the 10 to jiffies' current value. But
what happens if we were calling schedule_timeout() immediately before
the next timer interrupt occurs? Then we will only sleep slightly more
than 9 jiffies, instead of the 10 requested. The basic issue is that we
are always taking the floor of the current position in jiffies in
schedule_timeout() by adding the relative offset to jiffies. To
guarantee the timeout requested passes, we must add the relative offset
to (jiffies+1) [See the attached patch, which I think fixes the
"problem" in 2.6.13-rc5]. Most callers are already rounding up or adding
one to their request, so it may not be a problem. And, often, these are
sleeping paths, so most callers don't care about precision. So, while
you are correct that there is a chance for "infinite" sleep in
msleep_interruptible() and schedule_timeout_{intr,unintr}_msecs(), there
technically *should* be such a possibility in the jiffies case too, but
the code wasn't correct up until now.
All in all, seems buggy, but my analysis may also be wrong -- and this
case may be damn well near impossible to actually create.

I don't think I want the schedule_timeout*() functions' return values'
meanings to be different depending on whether you use milliseconds or
jiffies. Your version makes the millisecond-case boolean in return,
which is differnent than schedule_timeout()'s remaining-jiffies return
value.
I have also been thinking about the need to use
while(time_after(timeout_jiffies, timeout)) vs.  while(timeout_msecs),
but I will respond to a different e-mail about that.
Thanks,
Nish

Description: Ensure that schedule_timeout() requests can not possibly
expire early in the timeout case, by adding the requested relative jiffy
value to the next value of jiffies. Currently, by adding to the current
value of jiffies, we might actually expire a jiffy too early (in a
corner case).
