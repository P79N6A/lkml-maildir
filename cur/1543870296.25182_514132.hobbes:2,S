numbers are crutial here - and given the epoll bugs in the evserver code 
that we found, do you have updated evserver benchmark results that 
compare epoll to kevent? I'm wondering why epoll has half the speed of 
kevent in those measurements - i suspect some possible benchmarking bug. 
The queueing model of epoll and kevent is roughly comparable, both do 
only a constant number of steps to serve one particular request, 
regardless of how many pending connections/requests there are. What is 
the CPU utilization of the server system during an epoll test, and what 
is the CPU utilization during a kevent test? 100% utilized in both 
cases?
