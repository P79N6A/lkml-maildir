     [PATCH] generic_file_buffered_write(): deadlock on vectored write
?
if not, do you have any description of the problem or a link to previous 
discussion[s] outlining the problem? To me it appears this is a kernel 
bug where we simply dropped the ball to fix it. I personally dont find 
it acceptable to have deadlocks in the kernel, where all that is needed 
to trigger it is "high i/o loads", no matter how hard it is to fix the 
deadlock.
