The machine is 8-way x86_64.  In one window it is running `make -j32
vmlinux'.
In another window I run the `fpatch' command.  fpatch is a scruffy
shell script from
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/stuff/patch-scripts.tar.gz
 which does a
few mv's, cp's, etc.
current mainline:
akpm2:/usr/src/25> time fpatch b kernel/sched.c
fpatch b kernel/sched.c  0.02s user 0.09s system 33% cpu 0.338 total
Jan 26 linux-next:
akpm2:/usr/src/25> time fpatch b kernel/sched.c
fpatch b kernel/sched.c  0.02s user 0.05s system 0% cpu 32.739 total
Machine basically unusable, user unhappy!
I'm assuming it's a scheduler problem - everything is in pagecache.
