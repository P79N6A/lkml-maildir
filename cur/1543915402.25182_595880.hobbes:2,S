the queue with your enhancements and simplifications applied looks good 
here, and it booted fine on two testboxes. I've updated the 
sched-devel.git tree:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched-devel.git
(below is the full shortlog over current upstream.)
(I have not tested the group scheduling bits but perhaps Srivatsa would 
like to do that?)
