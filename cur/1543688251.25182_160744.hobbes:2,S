But 'die on boot' is much better than 'silently currupt data', don't you
think? 
Still, a proper fix would work in all cases... 
What do you think about a check in __ide_do_rw_disk? calling
lba_28_rw_disk or chs_rw_disk when the block address doesn't fit in
28bit is surely wrong and should return an error. 
This will lead to read or write errors if LBA48 doesn't work, but
it will prevent silent data corruption.
