One of my business partners had this problem a couple of weeks ago, fixed by
changing the MTU on the gateway/masq box to  1500.  What was strange though,
and _really_ masked the problem was that it was only with certain web sites
(specifically, the web sites would return in response to a HEAD but not a GET,
I guessed that this was something to do with the difference in packet size), and
only the Linux and WinNT boxes inside the network had this problem - the OS/2
box worked fine.  I'll ask him for TCPdumps of his version of the problem, if
that would help.
