	[Just finished reading your paper, and hit the linux-mm.org site]
	Good overview of the Linux 2.4 VM. Although I do
have some questions...
	* When was the 'FREENIX' paper published? I could find
	  no date for it.
	* What workloads would you recommend for testing whether
	  a VM is 'well balanced' or not?
	* Would it be reasonable to have different 'default'
	  tunings for the kernel's VM based upon memory/swap
	  size/bandwidth? Personally, I feel that swap bandwidth
	  is an oft overlooked parameter in estimating VM performance.
