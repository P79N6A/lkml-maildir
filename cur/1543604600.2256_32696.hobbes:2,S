Yes. With maybe
	non_preempt()
	..
	preempt()
around it for the pre-emption patches.
However, you also need to make your free _free_ be aware of the count.
Which means that the current RCU patch is really unusable for this. You
need to have the "count" always in a generic place (put it with the hash),
and your schedule-time free needs to do
	if (atomic_read(&count))
		skip_this_do_it_next_time
which starts getting complicated (it means your RCU free now has to have a
notion of "next time" - just leaving the RCU active will slow down
scheduling for as long as any reader holds on to an entry). So your
unread() path probably has to be
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&count))
		free_it()
and the act of hashing should add a count and unhashing should delete a
count (so that the reader doesn't free it while it is hashed).
Do that, and the RCU patches may start looking usable for the real world.
