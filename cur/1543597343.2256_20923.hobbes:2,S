I take it the policy JG is referring to applies to including any 
kernel header files at all in userspace programs, and that __KERNEL__ 
removal is a mere consequence of that policy.
AC points out that syscall interfaces in glibc are a reasonable 
exception to that policy.
What about a header like ethtool.h? Isn't its whole reason for 
existing to provide a common ABI for ethtool.c and the various 
drivers that support it?
Likewise sockios.h, which ethtool (and no doubt many others) also 
#includes. Unless you're going to encapsulate all possible ioctl 
interfaces into libc, sockios.h (for example) provides a piece of the 
ABI that's needed by the user code, not just by libc. Why would it 
make sense to require retyping of this stuff?
If, on the other hand, the argument is that user-kernel ABI 
definitions should be isolated in their own headers, and not mixed up 
(hence __KERNEL__), that's a much more restricted argument. My 
impression is that this is *not* the argument though; is it?
