Subject: [PATCH 0/30] Remove unneeded casts of [kv][mzc]alloc() return values

Hi,
The [kv][mzc]alloc() functions return a void pointer, so when 
assigning to a pointer type variable there is no need to cast 
the return value.
This is something that is already commonly being cleaned up when 
people change nearby code and it's also something people are 
usually asked not to do when submitting new code. 
I took a look at how many such casts are currently left and didn't 
find that many, so I cleaned them up.
I've probably missed some, but this patch series should clean up 
the majority of the remaining ones at least.
The patches in this series are
