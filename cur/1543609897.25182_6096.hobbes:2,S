Are there any relatively new documents on how to optimize /proc system
variables?
Securing and Optimizing RedHat Linux had a few,
/usr/src/linux/Documentation has a few.
Are there any current papers/documents that encompass all of the
settings and options that you can set?
ie: for 1 GB of ram
echo "100 1200 128 512 15 5000 500 1884 2" > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
Would be used.
However, this was taken from either a 2.2.x kernel or early 2.4.
Anyone know if any docs currently exist which explain how to tweak each
setting and what each setting means?
