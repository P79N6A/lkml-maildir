I think it's generally disliked. Quoting Documentation/CodingStyle:
``Encoding the type of a function into the name (so-called Hungarian
notation) is brain damaged - the compiler knows the types anyway and can
check those, and it only confuses the programmer.  No wonder MicroSoft
makes buggy programs.''

You can implement a sysctl-setting to enable/disable the whole system
(which then would be runtime changeable).
