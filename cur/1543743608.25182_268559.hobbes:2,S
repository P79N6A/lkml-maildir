Hi all.
Tracking down SMP problems, I've found that if you boot with
nmi_watchdog=1 (IO_APIC), the watchdog continues to run while suspend is
doing sensitive things like restoring the original kernel. I don't know
enough to provide a patch to disable it so thought I'd ask if someone
could volunteer to fix this?
Regards,
Nigel
