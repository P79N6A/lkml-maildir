| First off, acpi should be working just fine now...should have been for

Is that "should have been working" as in "I believe it to be working" or
"dammit they said it was working?"

ATAPI works fine for programs which know about it and are
Linux-specific. Programs expecting SCSI devices, which work on Linux
2.4, Solaris, SCO, and even Windows (I'm told) want SCSI.

Your mail was truncated, I believe.

You missed the "binary only" in his post. That software is no more
available in source than Windows.
I think the real point is not that it doesn't work, but that it oops's
the system. I would regard anything which a user can do which causes an
oops as a critical problem.
