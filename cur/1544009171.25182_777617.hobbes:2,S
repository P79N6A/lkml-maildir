Hello.
The "man 5 nologin" says that:
  If the file /etc/nologin *exists*, login (1) will allow access only to root.
  Other users will be shown the contents of this file and their logins will be
  refused.
But this description becomes inaccurate when MAC (e.g. SELinux) is enabled.
MAC can deny open("/etc/nologin", O_RDONLY) by root user. Thus,
  # ln /etc/shadow /etc/nologin
will create /etc/nologin which is *not readable* by login(1).
As a result, non-root user's logins are permitted while /etc/nologin *exists*.
I guess pam_nologin is using a code like
  fp = fopen("/etc/nologin", "r");
  if (fp)
     /* print the contents of /etc/nologin and reject login request. */
So, I think either one of below modifications is needed.
(1) Change the description of manpage like
  If the file /etc/nologin *is readable*, login (1) will allow access only to
  root. Other users will be shown the contents of this file and their logins
  will be refused.
(2) Change the code of pam_nologin like
  fd = open("/etc/nologin", O_RDONLY);
  if (fd != EOF || errno != ENOENT)
     /* print the contents of /etc/nologin and reject login request. */
Which one is the better solution?
Regards.
