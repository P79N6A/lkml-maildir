The crap below is something that could solve your problem (assumes that "a"
is the address of the instruction to be replaced and 0x42 is the opcode of
the new instruction):
- generates an irq on all other cpus -> prefetched stuff on them discarded
- catches all cpus
- writes the new instruction
- the atomic_inc(&cap.done) is a compare and swap instruction -> serialization
At least this is something that could work... completely untested and might
have some problems that I didn't think of ;)
struct capture_data {
	atomic_t cpus;
	atomic_t done;
};
void capture_wait(void *data)
{ 
	struct capture_data *cap = data;
	atomic_inc(&cap->cpus);
	while(!atomic_read(&cap->done))
		cpu_relax();
	atomic_dec(&cap->cpus);
}
void replace_instr(int *a)
{
	struct capture_data cap;
	preempt_disable();
	atomic_set(&cap.cpus, 0);
	atomic_set(&cap.done, 0);
	smp_call_function(capture_wait, (void *)&cap, 0, 0);
	while (atomic_read(&cap.cpus) != num_online_cpus() - 1)
		cpu_relax();
	*a = 0x42;
	atomic_inc(&cap.done);
	while (atomic_read(&cap.cpus))
		cpu_relax();
	preempt_enable();
}
