Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Various AIO retry related fixes and enhancements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/5/6

The following patches are a collection of various (mostly 
retry infrastructure related) fixes, cleanups and enhancements
for AIO, that I have been maintaining for a while. I ran into
most of them while implementing support for default high
level retry methods (should also be helpful as a foundation
for some network AIO work). Now that we have in-tree use 
of the retry logic, it makes sense to merge these fixes 
upstream. They are mostly localised to AIO code.
Note: The latter two patches involve policy oriented 
optimizations to the AIO workqueue usage, so I chose 
to separate them out.
Please apply.
