Hi.
I realize this is off subject to the mailing list, however its not really
off subject to the thread. What is the suggested method for dealing with
this? i.e. catching sigint which sets a global variable and then having
select() inside the loop, i.e.
while (boolean < 1 ) {
   [...]
   select(...);
   [...]
}
regards,
jnf
