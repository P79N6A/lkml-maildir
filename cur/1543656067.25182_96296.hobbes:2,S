Well, 450 bytes is way below 4k (~7 times less if we'd take task struct
into account) ;)
I can replace that on-stack array with kmalloc, but that probably
would be a lot of overhead for no benefit.
What do you think is safe stack usage limit for a function?
(and btw you have not even seen reiser4 stack usage ;) )
