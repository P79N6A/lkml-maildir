I just did, and they said just what I'd expect from common sense.  A
compatibility claim is, in principle, just fine.
Specifically, any attempt to pass off something that didn't come from
Red Hat as an official Red Hat product was verboten; but 
        I would distinguish this from someone who is promoting their own
        product, let's call it BillyBob's Linux, and who makes a claim
        that it is "compatible with Red Hat Linux."  So long as the
        compatibility statement is not used prominently in the
        advertising of the product and so long as the statement is, in
        fact, true, this would likely constitute a fair use of our mark,
        roughly along the lines of comparative advertising.
Cheers,
 Stephen
