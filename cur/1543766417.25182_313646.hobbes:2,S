I haven't tried to reproduce it since it will cause me data loss :(
I am not sure it is possible to go to this extent in order to reproduce
the reboot but still... Here is what I was doing when the error occured -
I installed Ubuntu AMD64 5.04 release. Installed 2.6.12-rc3.
Installed and configured a chroot env for 32bit programs. (dchroot) 
Installed 32bit JRE from Sun - latest one. Tried to install 
Borland Together J Eclipse edition under the chrooted environment 
- Just before the install finished, machine rebooted. Machine was 
running for couple hours before the reboot.
