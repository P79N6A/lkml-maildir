Hello.
I'm trying to learn more about the kernel, but when I'm reading
articles it has terms that are unfamiliar by me. E.g:
               page tables
               physical pages of memory
               virtual pages
               pages
               etc..
These terms are hard to understand for a newbie like me, is there
some page where I might get clear information about what they do?
Could someone provide me explanation? Maybe it would be a good idea
to do basic term explanations in wiki?
Joe
