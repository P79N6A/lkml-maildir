That's also what I found when looking at it a while ago. This isn't
necessarily a bug of tasklet_kill, just some behaviour that needs
to be documented.
You can always introduce a flag that tells the tasklet if it should
reschedule itself, and clear that flag before calling tasklet_kill.
When I looked at it (I think this was in some 2.4 kernel), it also
seemed that tasklet_kill could loop forever if the tasklet is
scheduled but disabled.
