Anecdotal evidence that microwave ovens aren't exactly new, or 
computerized for all their life.
I have an old Norelco thats one of the originals, a year or so newer 
than an Amana Radarange.  All 100% mechanical pushbuttons and a 
genuine electric clock timer.  Works just fine yet, probably at least 
35, maybe 40 years old.  I've turned the nylon bearing around that 
the aluminum fan blades shaft runs in, turned slowly by another small 
clock motor to 'stir' the microwaves, once.  Next time the fan blade 
starts dragging I'll have to go to my lathe and make another bearing 
and cut another new shaft I suppose.
I'd replace it, but the last time I tried that the missus wiped the 
panel down with a wet rag about a month after the warranty expired & 
that was the end of that fancy computerized panel.  This one refuses 
to die.  No use fixing what ain't broke I guess.  But I did have to 
replace the light bulb just recently, I think that was the third 
time...
Sorry, couldn't resist correcting the impression that microwaves are 
all new enough to be computerized.  Tain't so, by 25 years or more.
