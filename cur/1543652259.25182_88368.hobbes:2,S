I take this opportunity to advertise for the quiet facility of kbuild:
Sample run:
$> make KBUILD_VERBOSE=0
  CC      kernel/rcupdate.o
  CC      kernel/dma.o
kernel/dma.c:102: warning: `proc_dma_show' defined but not used
  CC      kernel/uid16.o
  LD      kernel/built-in.o
Warnings really hurts the eye when using this.
And the filename supplied should be good enough for emacs and the like.
I have seen only a few persons actually using this and I wonder if people
feel they loose some information when presented with this condensed format?
Compared to "make -s" you are able to follow the progress.
