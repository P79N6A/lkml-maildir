I agree with clean. The main problem here is to catch all threads/processes, 
including the ones not (yet) in the mainstream kernel and those which people 
haven't even written yet. I don't want something that breaks every once in a
while in subtle ways for some silly and apparently unrelated reason.
Of course there's The One Right Way(tm) to do it:
 - rename _*kernel_thread to _*kernel_thread_with_fs
 - find all other possible paths leading to kernel_thread/clone and do 
   the same thing there
 - construct the dentry jail (may be a little tricky, e.g. I'm not sure
   if d_inode = NULL is safe, and there are a few other pointers I don't
   quite trust)
 - write a kernel_thread_without_fs that calls kernel_thread_with_fs
   and then puts the process into the dentry jail
 - change all 30+ calls to _*kernel_thread to 
   _*kernel_thread_without_fs (and repeat this for all the other paths 
   you've found above)
 - notify the authors, so they know what's happening to their code
This still has the following problems:
 - you've just broken a few externally maintained packages, e.g.
   probably PCMCIA
 - threads that start early but access the file system only later
   still cause problems
 - doesn't help a bit with processes that aren't kernel threads
Of course, the latter two are somewhat hypothetical at the moment.
