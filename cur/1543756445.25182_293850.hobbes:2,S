Please put { on new line.
Okay, as you can see, I could find very little wrong with this
patch. That hopefully means it is okay ;-). I should still check error
handling, but I guess I'll do it when it is applied because it is hard
to do on a diff. I guess it should go into -mm just after 2.6.11 is
released...
