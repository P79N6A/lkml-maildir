Paul's motivation for saving the passed nodemask to set_mempolicy() is so 
that the _intent_ of the application is never lost.  That's the biggest 
advantage that this method has and that I totally agree with.  So whenever 
the mems_allowed of a cpuset changes, the MPOL_INTERLEAVE nodemask of all 
attached tasks becomes their intent (pol->passed_nodemask) AND'd with the 
new mems_allowed.  That can be done on mpol_rebind_policy() and shouldn't 
be an extensive change.
So MPOL_INTERLEAVE, and possibly other, mempolicies will always try to 
accomodate the intent of the application but only as far as the task's 
cpuset restriction allows them.
