    [WATCHDOG] Revert "Stop looking for device as soon as one is found"
    
    This reverts commit 3ff6eb4a2fe5757cbe7c5d57c8eb60ab0775f2f0.
    
    the !found check in the for loop allready made sure that only one
    device was found.

 A more advanced driver could for example check that a HTTP server is
 still responding before doing the write call to ping the watchdog.
