Not to mention the name used causes (at least me) some confusion with
BSD's kqueue implementation. Skimming over the patches it actually
looks somewhat like kqueue with the more interesting features removed,
like the ability to pass the filter changes simultaneously with
polling.
Maybe this is a topic that will singe my fur, but what is wrong with
the kqueue API? Will I really have to implement support for yet
another event API in my program.
