Well, I've never changed a line of code in the kernel (or in any
GPL product by the way) but I strolled thru the code and it seems the
right place to hack this woud be the capable() function. I wonder if
I could borrow some concepts from the quota system too, for the per-user
limit handling. Am I making any sense at all?
