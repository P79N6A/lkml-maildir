So, will you open such a branch?  If so, what would be the mechanics of
having patches applied to it?  I assume people would have to suggest such
changes explicitly and have them reviewed (hopefully more thoroughly than
usual) in that light.  I guess one place these "infrastructure" changes
may be noticed would be when subsystem maintainers stray outside their
subsystem in what they submit to the linux-next tree (or break it).
Then I assume most people would start working on a merge of this "next"
branch and your "master" branch, right?  Consequently, each linux-next
would also be based on that merge.
I suppose I am stating the obvious (or asking the dumb questions), but I
always find it easier to have explicit answers to these sorts of things.
