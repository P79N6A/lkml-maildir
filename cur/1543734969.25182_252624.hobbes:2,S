But the low level driver (like a USB driver for example), has no way of
knowing when the "device discovery" process is over.  Actually the USB
core never knows this either, as devices come and go all the time.
That's why we had to move to the "probe" and "release" way of writing
drivers.  The bus cores notify the driver when they find something, as
the driver never knows when a device is found.
So the kernel can not know what or when to wait for something it doesn't
know is going to ever happen in the future.
Does that make more sense now?
Remember, this isn't your old "static device tree" unix-like kernel that
people grew up with, anymore. :)
