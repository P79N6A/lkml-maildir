As I mentioned before, this is where you expect an event to happen (I
want x to happen at some time).  The event being to take out the
cookies.

And this is where a time out is done when some event doesn't happen (I
want to know if x didn't happen by some time).  The event here is to
turn off the oven and the time out is to let you know that you didn't
and the house will soon burn down if you don't turn it off.

I started kernel programming with writing experimental network stacks.
So to me "timeout" is strongly engraved in my head as to let you know
when something didn't happen, and you need to do something to recover
for it.  If you send out a packet and you don't receive an ACK, you have
a timeout let you know that it probably didn't make it (or the ACK
didn't make it to you), and send another packet out.  But most likely,
(unless you are on a really unreliable network) you get your ACK and you
can remove the time out.
I know that timeouts are used tremendously in the networking code, so
separating them from precision timers would likely be a good thing.
