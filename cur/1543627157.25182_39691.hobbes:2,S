Hi!
everything is working fine with this kernel, but this
modprobe ide-scsi
hdd: ATAPI reset complete
ide-scsi: (IO,CoD) != (0,1) while issuing a packet command
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 221340, scsi1, channel 0, id
0, lun 0 Inquiry 00 00 00 ff 00
SCSI host 1 abort (pid 221340) timed out - resetting
SCSI bus is being reset for host 1 channel 0.
hdd: ATAPI reset complete
ide-scsi: (IO,CoD) != (0,1) while issuing a packet command
hdd: ATAPI reset complete
forever it does.
is it because of AC's stuff?
which version is recommended for daily use?
thanks
