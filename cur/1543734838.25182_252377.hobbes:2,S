Hi,
since I have recently updated to kernel 2.6 (Suse 2.6.5-7.108-default) my 
mouse is going crazy from time to time and I am seeing such messages in my 
logfile:
kernel: psmouse.c: Mouse at isa0060/serio2/input0 lost synchronization, 
throwing 2 bytes away.
How can this be avoided?
My notebook has a touchpad built in and I have additional connected an old 
Logitech 3 Button PS/2 mouse:
<6>input: PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio2
<6>serio: i8042 AUX2 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
<6>serio: i8042 AUX3 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
<6>Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
<6> Firmware: 5.6
<6> 180 degree mounted touchpad
<6> Sensor: 18
<6> new absolute packet format
<6> Touchpad has extended capability bits
<6> -> four buttons
<6> -> multifinger detection
<6> -> palm detection
<6>input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio4
I'd also like to get the old kernel 2.4 touchpad behaviour. With 2.4 the it 
had sent a Button1 event by simply touching it. Now I have to press the 
appropriate button.
I have seen the module parameter "proto" in the source. Is it worth to play 
with it?
Thanks,
Torsten
