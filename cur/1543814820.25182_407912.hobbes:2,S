I found that out the hard way.  I first tried AE_BAD_PARAMETER but the
kernel paniced on boot, which I don't understand.  So then I switched to
returning AE_OK, and it booted fine.  But it hung on the *second* sleep
cycle.  So the problem got worse, or the bug is slithering around and
shows up in odd places depending what we do.

Here first are the dmesgs from suspending with a vanilla 2.6.16-rc5.  I
did only one cycle so that it didn't hang and I could edit this email
without rebooting (but later suspends produce the same method calls, I'm
90% sure):
