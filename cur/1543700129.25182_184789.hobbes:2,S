Just want to add my voice to the chorus.  Fantastic work everybody. I'm just 
busting with pride at what this disparate, passionate, argumentative, 
arrogant, unassuming, pigheaded and exceptional bunch of people manages to 
achieve, again and again.
My wishlist for 2004
1) Drivers, drivers, drivers. Any of you who have influence, lobby h/w 
manufacturers for linux support. ([Grinds teeth] mutter....centrino...
mutter...). And _please_ nuture all the ones we do have. Talk to them, stroke 
them, polish the paintwork...
2) Amd-64 to become the default arch (Unless I get a centrino driver)
3) Andrew Mortons need/should-fix lists to be different in 2.8  ;)
4) Enroll for my Egg Sucking classes, and bring your granny :)
Merry Christmas, and thanks for the Mighty Gift!
