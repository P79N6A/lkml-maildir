You seem to forget that the main problems are:
-	These distributions do not talk with the original Authors which
	demonstrates that they do not like to benefit from OSS.
-	The modified versions of cdrtools found in distributions are _all_
	worse than the original. As some of the distributions (e.g. SuSE)
	even published versions known to be defective, they violate 
	the GPL (subsection 6 of the preamble).
