Fairly typical example of the type of error the additional check was
expected to find. Note also that the same thread should be using
complete_and_exit().
I suspect some of the instances of del_timer() should be
del_timer_sync() too. Particularly in msp_wake_thread() and
map_detach().
Is there something we can do to make del_timer() break when it should
have been del_timer_sync()... like waiting five seconds and then
deliberately calling it on another CPU? :)
