So you are saying that even though we have locking sequences
  A -> B  and B -> A,
that cannot - in this case - cause a deadlock as both sequences only
ever happen under a third exclusive lock C,
So when lockdep records a lock-dependency A -> B, it should also
record a list of locks that are *always* held when that dependency
occurs.
Then, when it finds a new dependency and does loop detection, it
should exclude from the path any dependency which is always under a
lock that some other dependency in the path is always under.
Also, loop checking as to happen both when a new dependency is found,
and when a lock is removed from the set of locks that protect the
dependency.
Recording stack traces might be interesting as you potentially need to
record a trace for ever minimal set of locks that the dependency is
created under.
So the ball is back in Ingo's court ?
Though it is odd that the warning doesn't trigger every time....

In that case,  I was never dreaming of blaming him, only letting him
know that there is a lock-dep warning in code that he might be seen as
responsible for - just in case anyone does blame him.
Yes.  That's what I was doing.  Definitely.
