Subject: [PATCH] Fix lazy mode vmalloc synchronization for paravirt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Found this looping Ubuntu installs with VMI.
If unlucky enough to hit a vmalloc sync fault during a lazy mode 
operation (from an IRQ handler for a module which was not yet populated 
in current page directory, or from inside copy_one_pte, which touches 
swap_map, and hit in an unused 4M region), the required PDE update would 
never get flushed, causing an infinite page fault loop.
This bug affects any paravirt-ops backend which uses lazy updates, I 
believe that makes it a bug in Xen, VMI and lguest.  It only happens on 
LOWMEM kernels.
Currently for 2.6.23, but we'll want to backport to -stable as well.

    Touching vmalloc memory in the middle of a lazy mode update can generate
    a kernel PDE update, which must be flushed immediately.  The fix is to
    leave lazy mode when doing a vmalloc sync.
