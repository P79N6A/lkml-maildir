Tried this.  Still crashed.  See oops #1 below.
A bit more info for 'ya.  I got two oops's last night.  I haven't been
able to build 2.2.13pre11 yet, but will do that this weekend.
This is still all with 2.2.12 w/IKD patch.
Below are my notes files and my traces.  #2 is a completely new oops
for me.  It oops'ed while fsck'ing at bootup, something I've never
seen before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1:
# cat oops.12.notes
1 - DISPLAY=localhost:0
    It died anyway (see oops).
2 - After the initial oops, I used gpm to cut the oops from one virtual
    console and paste into a file (cat > oops.12 {paste}^d).  I then
    tried to run ksymoops.  I typed
    'ksymoops < oops.12 > oops.12{tab}' (trying to let bash fill in the
    name oops.12.trace -- which didn't exist).  The console quit
    responding for some time.  I could switch consoles via alt-f-n, but
    that console was not responding.  I tried to login on another console:
    typed 'root{enter}', but did not get prompted for a password.  I switched
    back to the the ksymoops console and tried '^Q', etc to free it up,
    when the second oops was reported.  I was then able to run ksymoops
    as normal, and the system seems to be behaving normally (as it does
    after X/IKD oops's).  I have to reboot to run X again.  The X server
    process is dead, but it's still holding open the port, etc.
# cat oops.12.trace
Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.12/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)

              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.

#2:
# cat oops.13.notes
This oops occurred during a boot after #12.  #12 left the system in
a state such that the I was not able to sync/unmount the file systems
successfully.  The system was performing its fsck's.
The last message before the oops was that it was checking /dev/hda9.
After the oops, it appeared that the system finished all fsck's, but
then never continued after that.  The system was quite idle when I
found it -- I had been busy doing something else for a while.
The alt-sysreq keys were functioning, but other than that the system
was completely dead.  I used alt-sysreq-b to reboot.
Upon booting, it forced a check of /dev/hda11, which apparently hadn't
completed checking for some reason (certainly related to the oops).
Note also that I had to copy this oops by hand to paper and then type
it back in, so there might be a typeo or two, but I was pretty careful
and double-checked it all, too.
