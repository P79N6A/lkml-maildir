How do you get that?!
IPv6 addresses are 128 bit. 64 of those bits are "usually" determined by  
the MAC address (yes, 64, not 48), and the usual end organization  
assignment from that RFC is 16 bits more (that is, 80 bits total) for  
subnetting use - I'd expect ISP customers to not get those 16 bits.
