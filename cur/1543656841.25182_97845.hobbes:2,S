If so, then you are fortunate.  But in the abstract, and more importantly
in the mind of the maintainer of a lock-free SMP allocator who is trying
to allow simultaneous allocation and valgrind of the allocator, then such
atomicity problems are real.  The VALGRIND_* statements should allow
the conscientious and meticulous maintainer to express the correct
semantics, even though the current implementation of valgrind for UML
might not [have to] take advantage of all of the properties of such a
precise description.  If nothing else, then such a maintainer will invent
his own VALGRIND_* usage to express simultaneous {allocator, valgrind}
state transitions precisely.
