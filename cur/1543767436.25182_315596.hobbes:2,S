Umm, you are right, HALT is somewhere between FREEZE and SUSPEND.

Global system state transition should be clear from flags. Specific
device state is needed for selective suspend, elsewhere I'd go for
helper function.

I'd prefer not to have more callbacks (unless absolutely
neccessary). We used to have them, and people got it wrong....
