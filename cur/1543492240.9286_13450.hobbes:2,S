It's me again - I'm sure you're sick of hearing from me by now (grin).
I did get kernel 2.2.5 installed (correctly, this time), and everything 
updated.
Unfortunately, this didn't fix an ittermittent problem I've been noticing 
since I first installed Linux.
Occasionally (about 1 out of every 4 reboots), my CD-ROM drive will be 
detected as a 4X drive (and run as one), instead of a 40X ATAPI drive, as it 
should be.  This problem was actually happening with less frequency under 
2.0.0 than it currently has under 2.2.5.  The freaky thing is, it is totally 
unpredictable as to when it will be detected incorrectly.
It's not really a serious problem, more of an annoyance, but I fear it as a 
possible prelude or sign of worse.
Also, time before last that I recompiled the kernel, my /boot/config was not 
updated.  (I haven't checked yet this compile.)  Odd, eh?
One further thing, does anyone know whether there is currently support 
anywhere for the Elite PCI Audio card (a.k.a. CMI8338 with 3D audio)?
It is a 64-bit PCI card, which claims to be SB compatible, but it really 
requires a DOS TSR to be run to translate the port addresses (and even then 
it's not really compatible, as the Sierra Quest for Glory series for DOS can 
attest. My estimation is about 80-90%).
There was an earlier thread about it I found in the linux-kernel archives, but 
it disappeared without resolving the issue, or even answering the question (or 
not that I found, anyway).  The last posting I saw (by Alan Cox) said that the 
PCI-to-ISA layer should make it compatible with Linux, too.  Unfortunately, he 
was saying that on false information, as the owner of the other card believed 
the program run to make it SB compatible was not a TSR, he believed it merely 
fed information to the EPROM on the card, asking it to switch modes.  This 
isn't what is happening.
I would disassemble the TSR myself and try to port it (it's only a 2K .com 
file), but I'm afraid I don't know enough about driver development for Linux 
yet.  If anyone knows where I can find a driver for it in native mode, or is 
willing to help me port the TSR to translate it into Soundblaster mode, I 
would be more than grateful.
Thanks in advance for any assistance rendered.
