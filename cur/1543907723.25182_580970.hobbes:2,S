This is a BIOS bug as the BIOS should have programmed the MSR the same for 
both cores.  See section 10.2.4 of the Rev F BKDG [1] (10.2.4.1 talks about 
the SMI case but a newer version of the doc not yet release has similar 
wording about both cores needing to have the bit set for the chipset case).
