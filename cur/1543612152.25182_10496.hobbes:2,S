I tried sym-2 (2.4.17-pre2) and it didn't show up the problem, which is good!
More news from the old driver:
    1.5c            OK
    1.5d            OK
    1.5e            page fault in interrupt handler 0xa53c0c68
    1.5f            lock up
    1.5pre-g1       lock up
    1.5pre-g2       lock up
    1.5pre-g3       corruption
    1.5g            corruption
So it happened somewhere in between 1.5d and 1.5pre-g3. I'll see whether I can
get any of the intermediates to run...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
