Which brings up another VERY valid point.  Is Linux not
eventually heading in the direction of having the possibility of
having a system with *NO* root user?  If *NO* user can hit the
hardware, they *HAVE* to go through the kernel.
Please someone, counter this argument.  Is the capability system
there for a reason or no?  Once root is done away with, how will
"root" who might as well be "potato" do direct I/O?

Things that can potentially harm hardware should require manual
intervention by someone technically capable of doing
so.  Motherboards should have flash jumpers, hard disks too, as
should all hardware.  If your hardware has a flaw, and needs a
BIOS update or firmware update, and you are joe idiot, then you
PAY someone to do the update for you.  It is the hardware
manufacturers that are at fault here for designing insecure
hardware to begin with.
Hmm..  Good way to get free hardware though too.  Someone could
use the bad code to fry their hard disk 10 days before the
warranty expires, and get a new one, perhaps larger (after making
appropriate backups of course).  ;o)
