Even with fbdev... you are limited to 512 characters iirc. So.. who
has authority to say which subset of utf-8 is ok?
(Plus there is still lot of vga consoles out there -- all fedora users

He probably means serial terminals... like physical vt100. I used to
have one (vt302 compatible or something).  Most emulators still
emulate vt100, and yes, vt100 predates utf-8.
