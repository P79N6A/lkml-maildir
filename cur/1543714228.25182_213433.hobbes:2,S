Very odd.  i'm using plain 2.6.5 with your 2.6.3
APIC patches, and left all this io_apic_set_pci_routing()
stuff in.  And, for this first time in who knows
how long i seem to have a stable computer.  Actually
been up more than eight days.
This is an old overclocked MSI K7N2 with the first
revision of the nForce2 chipset, the one that's only
supposed to have UDMA100 (dunno if that's the chipset
or the MSI mboard: the 2.6.X kernels have always said
during bootup that it's running UDMA133).  i use an
old Tulip ethercard instead of the onboard LAN.
This machine is the beater box: an HTPC and a 24/7
file share client, compile and test stuff, play music
thru an Audigy sound card, burn DVD's, play video
files, many of these things at the same time.
Before this kernel i was lucky to have uptimes over
two days.
