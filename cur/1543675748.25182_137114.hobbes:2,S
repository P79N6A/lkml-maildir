Greetings all,
I've been converting the few files with old-style function prototypes to
ANSI C, and I would like to make sure the following is acceptable. 
Original form:
int
foo()
{
   	/* body here */
}	
Proposed conversion:
int foo(void)
{
   	/* body here */
}	
The above should be straightforward, but if there are any problems with
that, please holler.  I'll be sending patches through the maintainers
soon.
Steven
