After some fiddling with it, looks to me like it's just a combination of
EXPIRED_STARVING(rq) doing it's thing, which in turn causes (if you're
running kde at least) your terminal to not be able to keep up, which
makes it lose priority due to burning more cpu trying to catch up.
Try this.  Using virgin 2.6.16, disable EXPIRED_STARVING(rq), and start
your ping -A without any cpu hogs.  If you're running KDE, you'll notice
that the konsole priority where ping is running remains forever highly
interactive.  Enable EXPIRED_STARVING(rq) and repeat.  Just from the
scrolling, being bumped into the expired array will cause konsole to
lose priority because of increased cpu usage trying to catch up.
There is a price to be paid for starvation prevention.  You can choose
when it's paid, and in what sized installments, but pay you will :-/

The round-robin logic prevents this from being a problem.
