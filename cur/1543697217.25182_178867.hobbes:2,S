Very nice =)

I've walked that code and can't see anything wrong anywhere.

Well i have tried a number of heavyweight functions, so far none of them 
have had the effect that a printk has had. It's also worth noting that a 
printk lookalike function such as the following, does not fix things 
either.
asmlinkage int kooh_la_la(const char *fmt, ...)
{
	return strlen(fmt);
}
