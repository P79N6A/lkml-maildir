But there is space on the backing device.  Given two files on the same
file system, one should not be returning ENOSPC on write and the other
succeeding.

EPERM isn't even a valid SUSv3 return for write(2).  Permissions don't
apply to writes, only opens (and, thus, this is a valid return for
open(2)).
The answer has already been suggested: EACCESS or EIO.
