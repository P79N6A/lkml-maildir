Hi folks!
There are some bugs in the pcnet32 network driver. I fixed these bugs
and commented the code so that future hacking is somewhat
easier. Since I'm not sure what to do with the code I just post it to
this list. If there's more I can do to include the code in new
kernels, please let me know.
The source version that i've used is the following:
0636e57db60c0477948d93d02a984bc5  /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/pcnet32.c
Ciao,
Tobias
