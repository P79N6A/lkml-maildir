To contrast.  We have had the best success with Linux 2.4.7 with HIGHMEM 
support enabled.
I see several people having similar symptoms and everyone is point 
fingers at tmpfs or ramfs or xfs (I pointed my finger there 
originally).  It seems to me that it is something more fundamental and 
that particular usage patterns are triggering this.  I have around 20 
different dual processor machines that run 2.4.7-xfs, 2.4.2-xfs, or 
2.4.12-xfs and I can only replicate it when I put heavy filesystem 
activity on the machine.
Every time I replicate the problem, I become less certain of the actual 
cause!  I have kdb and SysReq enabled on all these boxes and it doesn't 
cause a console freeze, so if some extra info would be helpful, let me 
know and I will gather it during the next "glitch."
I am confident that the problem, on triggered, directly effects all 
filesystem code.  Once I have an "unkillable" process scheduled, it is 
CPU bound and all filesystem sync operations fail.  The sync command 
never returns, reboot won't work without (-n) and all my mailers (exim 
in this case) freeze on their fsync calls.
The _REALLY_ bad thing here (other than suspended disk I/O and the cruel 
reboot) is that all file blocks that are modified after this "glitch" 
are full of \000's upon reboot.  A good portion of my mail spool is 
corrupted as well as other files.  I don't know if this is specific to 
only journalled file systems as I cannot afford the downtime of 
replicating this problem on a non-journalled fs.
