Andrew,
Thanks for the review comments!

Ok. I will add a detailed comment here.

I think we should go ahead with current glibc implementation (which
Jakub poited at) of not allowing a negative 'len', since posix also
doesn't explicitly say anything about allowing negative 'len'.

True.

Ok. I will add a check here for wrap though zero.

Will add a check for negative 'len' and return -EINVAL. This will be
done where currently we check for negative offset (i.e. at the start of
the function).

Ok. Will remove it.

Will add a comment describing the role of these modes.

Ok. Will add the variable names here.
