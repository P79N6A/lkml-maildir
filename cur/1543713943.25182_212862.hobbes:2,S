It's a mix.  module_param(), MODULE_PARM_DESC(), MODULE_LICENSE(),
MODULE_AUTHOR(), MODULE_DESCRIPTION().
So the whole patch isn't bad, just the bit like:
-module_param()
+MODULE_PARM()

Sure, although some of these changes may not be accepted simply because
they create noise, patch conflicts etc at a time where stability is more
important.  So new code should use the new ones, old code may not all be
converted for some time.
