Oh, the original makes _tons_ of sense. It's just that it doesn't show the 
real dependency.
It's perfectly fine to say
	bool
	depends on USB_STORAGE && BLK_DEV_IDE
and the bool will be true whenever usb storage and blk-dev-ide both are 
enabled somehow. So far so fine. 
It's just that in this case, it simply wasn't enough. It didn't _just_ 
depend on BLK_DEV_IDE, it depended on it being available at link-time. So 
the original Kconfig rule made perfect sense, it just didn't match the 
real dependency.
