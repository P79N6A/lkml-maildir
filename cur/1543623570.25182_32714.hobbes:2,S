That's correct.  And the mm.h macros *are* respected.  That patch
ensures that they are.
It goes as far as to rename PG_locked and PG_dirty to PG_locked_dontuse
and PG_dirty_dontuse.
I'll be adding page_cache_size to the above struct, at least.
The "run summation" function is already there, btw: get_page_state().

Well it's all a part of a work to aggressively improve the efficiency
of regular file I/O.  I don't know if the big grand plan will be successful
yet.  At this time, it's thumbs up - way up.
Nor do I know if this is a direction in which Linus wishes to take
his kernel.
But this change, the readahead changes, the pdflush pool and a few other
pieces I have planned are probably appropriate for the base kernel
irrespective of the end outcome.
We'll see...
