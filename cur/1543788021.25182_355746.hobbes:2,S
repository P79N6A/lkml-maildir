You continue to misunderstand everyone else's opinion.  No one is 
claiming that LSI/MPT is the norm.
The claim is that the transport class is the method through which a 
transport layer is plugged into the SCSI stack.  Pluggable transport 
classes means that SAS transport layer details go into the SAS transport 
class (or a helper lib).  SPI (parallel/legacy SCSI) transport layer 
details should move to the SPI transport class.

You misunderstood that everybody, but you, has moved on to the "what do 
we do about this" phase.

Nothing is upside down.  Transport details plug into an obvious location 
-- the transport class, and associated helper libs (if any).
