Then you need a way to certify what is on your system, probably off-line: A
rescue-diskette style freestanding system that keeps the tools to check the
files on the system, and perhaps also a database of cryptographic hashes
for key system pieces.
The ideas you seem to advocate are called "security through obscurity" in
crypto circles, where they have been thoroughly discredited. What is needed
is publically scrutinized, easy to use and unintrusive systems that rely on
secure mechanisms (i.e., crypto keys, secure hashes) to verify integrity.
If the source is open, everybody will look it over, and flaws will be found
and fixed quickly. If the source is closed, flaws will be discovered a bit
slower by the wrong people, and never fixed.
Packages today are distributed with MD5 hashes, and signed with PGP/GPG, so
it is _very_ hard to troyan a package and getting away with it for any
amount of time.
