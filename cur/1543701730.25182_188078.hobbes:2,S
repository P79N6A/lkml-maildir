After starting tuxcard or the program "fracplanet" (creates a 3d model of
a planet) and possibly others, my screen looks exactly the same as you can
see on the screen shots of S Ait-Kassi. Beside this, random pixels still
appearing.
My Hardware:
CPU:		AMD 2800+
Graphic card:	Radeon 7000 (with 64 Mb RAM)
Motherboard:	MSI KT4V
Chipset:	KT400
PS: I got several tips already and they made it a little bit better, but
it's still not ok.
