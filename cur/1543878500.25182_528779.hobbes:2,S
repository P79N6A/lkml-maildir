When the filesystem is told to mount the disk read only, that means it 
should not write to it.  The fact that ext3 goes ahead and does anyway 
is a bug and should be fixed.  There is no need for a norecovery option, 
because read only is a sufficient directive to tell the filesystem not 
to write to the disk.
As someone else pointed out, this behavior causes havoc if you hibernate 
a system and then boot up another system which mounts the disk of the 
hibernated system.  Under all conditions it should be safe to mount a 
disk read only, but here it is not because the journal playback trashes 
the disk out from under the hibernated system.
