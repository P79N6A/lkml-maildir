With your help I realized today that vmware turned the abort flag on 
and didn't turn it off when the program exited. So now the problem is 
fixed in linux. Thanks a lot.
Indeed, it wasn't a kernel's version problem.
Printing under vmware still doesn't work, but it is a vmware issue,
so my kernel problem is now over.
Thanks for your time and help.
