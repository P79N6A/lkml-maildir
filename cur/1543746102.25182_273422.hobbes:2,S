that should be follwing:
Kconfig:
foo depends on ds9490r
obj-$() += foo.o
foo-objs := foo_1.o foo_2.o
It just happened that ds9490r does not need any other parts but
dscore.o.
That is why ds9490r.o have only dscore.o in it's dependency.

Why remove existing non disturbing set of exported functions?
Are they violate some unknown issues?
