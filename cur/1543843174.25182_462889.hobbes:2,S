I'm just posting this as a follow-up in case anyone runs across the same 
problem I experienced and couldn't find a solution.  My problem was the 
old Cisco IOS [Version 12.3(8)YI1] that came installed on my Cisco 1811 
router I purchased in March 2006.   I believe this is still the default 
shipping version for this router, so anyone who buys one really needs to 
get a Cisco support contract for it from a Cisco reseller so they can 
download a new/working IOS [Version 12.4(9)T1 was the most recent as of 
this email and was the one I used].
