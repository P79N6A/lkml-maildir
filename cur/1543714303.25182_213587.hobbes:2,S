the problem seems to be very simple: yenta can't get an interrupt 'cos another
driver has the same interrupt line exclusivley. it's the pc110pad driver.
deactivate it under
	Character devices  --->
		Mice  --->
			<n> PC110 digitizer pad support
and yenta get's it's interrupt back :)
it's a driver for the digitizer pad on the IBM PC110 palmtop. i don't think
you need it.
your cardbus firewire card will work too, since it shares the interrupt line with
the cardbus bridge.
