There is such a driver. I'm writing it. It allows all you've mentioned,
and more. Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress, though
it works well for most AT, PS/2 and USB mice and keyboards now.
No serial or bus mouse support at this moment, but that's just a question
of adding a couple modules.
There is no docs yet, that'll come soon. Just a kernel patch:
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/linux/input/2.3.3-input-34.gz
The patch currently includes not only the generic input code, but also
patches to the virtual console code to allow multihead, and clean up
and modularization patches to the USB code.
Try it; I hope you'll like it.
