We should be able to make the vast majority of those go away, btw.
We already have `-o data=writeback,nobh'.  That gives us writeback-mode
with no buffer_heads on the pagecache.
On top of that we can implement nobh ordered-mode by adding an inode walk
which calls do_sync_file_range() into the appropriate place in commit.
The tricky part is the inode walk - at present super_block.s_list is a
list_head and it's not trivial to walk that without missing some inodes.
Probably it could be done via a new fs-private dirty-inode list which we
hande carefully, or via a walk of an i_ino-ordered radix-tree, which
doesn't miss things.
I floated this a year or so ago, but no little fishies bit.
