  Please help my education... after looking at the code, I don't see why
the BUG_ON was removed rather than made dependent on SMP, assuming that
the BK comment and my hasty reading of code actually mean that it did work
for SMP.
  Is this a solid "can't happen" now and no test needed, or is a better
test in the works, or ???
  I didn't try to compile it, so there may be something I'm totally
missing.
