 We can do lseek to any position  with SEEK_CUR or SEEK_SET.
That position is byte position, not  map number or map address.
Changing byte position with lseek generates all the output upto the
desired point  inside the kernel using seq  traverse().  Moreover records
are not of fixed lengths.  But given the adress,   finding the page can be
short  circuited (find_vma()  finds it in O(log n) time).  There is no API
 from user.  Changing the semantics of lseek to  other  than byte position
does not look  right.

Yes, Proc files do not implement ioctl method.  I guess we can add
this feature as ioctl on  /proc/pid/maps file, if  everyone agrees  that is right.
One of the following methods.
ioctl (fd,  GET_MAP,  address,  buf)  -  Does not interfere with lseek
or read.  Find it and copy it.
   OR
ioctl (fd,   SET_FPOS,  address)  - Changes the file position to the
byte position of the map corresponding to address, and next read
returns the data from that position.  Once the adress is found,  this
needs generating all the data upto  that address similar to lseek. If
we convert maps to fixed length records,  it would be better, but
still  needs to find how many records were before this record.
Thanks,
Prasanna.
