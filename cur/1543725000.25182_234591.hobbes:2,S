Greetings;
I noticed tonight, while booted to 2.6.8-rc1, that my gkrellm display 
was a little short, all the temps and voltages were on the missing 
list.  So, based on the more eyeballs theory, I rebooted a few times 
testing recent kernels.
Backing up to 2.6.7-mm6, it all worked, so I grabbed Andrews rc1-mm1 
patch and installed that.
I'm happy to note that the sensors stuff is back among the living and 
being displayed properly with 2.6.8-rc1-mm1.
I've no idea which of the patches involving the i2c stuff wasn't right 
for my chipset (via686 & winbond 697hf IIRC), but something broke it 
just for 2.6.8-rc1.
