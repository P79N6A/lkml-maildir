Ack about signal.h, I forgot about the pwait code :(
Why syscalls.h? The eventpoll.c file expots syscalls, but it doesn't use 
anything declared in there.
What does eventpoll.c use *directly* from mm.h? If eventpoll.c uses, let's 
say sched.h, and sched.h needs mm.h, it is sched.h responsibility to 
include the mm.h file not eventpoll.c one.
