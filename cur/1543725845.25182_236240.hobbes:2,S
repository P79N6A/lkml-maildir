in -J3 i've added a cond_resched to the latency-generating point of
get_user_pages(). (The biggest latencies happen via
make_pages_present(), which gets triggered by mlockall()/MAP_LOCKED.)

this is the normal sys_exit()->exit_mmap()->unmap_vmas() path. It's
weird that it generated a 2ms latency. What are the values of
voluntary_preemption and kernel_preemption on your current kernel? With
a 2:0 setting we ought to have a reschedule point every 32 pages.  Do
you know which application triggers this latency and is it easy to
reproduce?

does this one trigger when you are using the VGA console? (or fbcon)?
it's not immediately obvious to me precisely where this latency comes
from, it would be nice to know how to reproduce it.
