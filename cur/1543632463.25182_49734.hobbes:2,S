The radeonfb from kernel-2.4.18 does not work with the radeon 7500 QW. I have
a digital flat screen connected to the dvi port and X works great. I just
see a blank screen when the system boots up. Is this a known issue? Is their
an more recent driver floating around? I got this card because I needed a
dvi connection, is their another card I should get.
Thanks, --Lou
