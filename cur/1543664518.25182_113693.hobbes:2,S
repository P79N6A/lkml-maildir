Yep, the instruction count used for inlining seems to be calculated too
early to be useful. Things like sigorsets look huge until all the
redundant cases get optimised away.
Also in gcc 3.2 -Winline was broken, I really hope that gets fixed. We
need it to tune -finline-limit and to catch all those stupidly large
inline functions.
