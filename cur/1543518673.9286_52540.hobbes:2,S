It's not only a problem of the chip companies (S3 in this case), but also
of the board manufacturer which selects different types of memories with
different timings and so on depending on current prices, phase of the
moon... This info is hidden somewhere in the ROM BIOS, perhaps even in
immediate constants in x86 instructions, since it is used only once on
startup.
