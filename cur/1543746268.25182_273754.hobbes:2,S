While we are at it: Is xfs known to be broken while preempt is on? (Esp 
using ck's preemp big kernel lock?) I got following using a raid0 setup 
with xfs. I thought it would be a driver issue, but reformatting to ext3 
the stripe array runs now w/o probs for a few days. (xfs crapped out 
after a few hours on heavy disk activity.)

If you need more infos (dmesg, .config, etc) let me know.
