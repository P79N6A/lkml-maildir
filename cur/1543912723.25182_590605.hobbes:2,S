agreed.  but i'm not proposing that *every* feature in the kernel be
investigated to see what category it falls into -- that's clearly an
unreasonable thing to do.
all this new construct is doing is implementing a new way to globally
select or de-select large sets of kernel features to display for user
selection, in exactly the way that EXPERIMENTAL does it now, that's
all.  these attributes would not *force* selection, they would simply
*filter* what to display, nothing more.
this whole attribute thing is not adding anything breathtaking new,
it's simply taking the example set by EXPERIMENTAL and generalizing
it and making it more convenient in the process.
and, as a start, the first thing to do is apply a patch that defines
an attribute and its possible values, and allows kernel features (via
Kconfig files) to be tagged with that attribute, without being able to
do anything with it yet.  one step at a time.
