Here is a URL for mail readers that make that more useful:

There is very little that is network-specific about the code.
It's certainly not "network centric".

Questions:
Does your approach handle hot-swap PCI and CardBus with a single driver?
What about ACPI and Wake-on-*?
Does allow backwards- and forward-compatible drivers?
   With the existing user-level PCMCIA implementation as well.
Do you have a driver to demonstrate CardBus suspend, eject and resume?
  Merely asserting that it will handle it isn't good enough -- it took me
  dozens over versions to get it right, and I've been writing Linux
  PCMCIA drivers since '93, PCI drivers since '94 and several years
I have converted (and tested) a dozen network and character drivers to my
scan code.  Four of those support both CardBus and PCI devices, and
presumably hot-swap PCI (I don't yet have test hardware).
Remember that any change in interface code triggers a massive amount of
work.  A change that takes only a few minutes to make may take me hours or
days for me to update and retest my drivers, and is a contining testing
workload over the next few years.  So you must the interface close to right
the first place, and that means private development and testing.

???  The PCI_COMMAND stuff isn't a whim.
It, like the latency correction and ACPI wake-up, is required for some systems.
