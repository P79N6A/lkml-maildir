Actually I don't mean by mentioning "SHIFT, MASK, SZIE macros are used
in creating Page Translation Table" that you will see them in
pgd_alloc() etc but they are used in many memory initialization
fucntions at the boot time ...... and for example look
http://lxr.linux.no/source/arch/i386/mm/init.c#L207
  !!!!!! These
Macros are might be there for the compatibility reasons tooo as you
can see the PAGE_SIZE can be changed but if you use PAGE_SIZE in every
module/place you won't be concerned about the actual size of the page
at that moment or in Architecture ...........
