Hi Tom.
Patch looks good. The last bit touching sumversion.c is not
needed in latest kernel - we already include limits.h.
I need you to sign off the patch as per instruction in
Documentation/SubmittingPatch.
Please do so and send me a new mail containing both
changlog entry (the introduction part of your mail) and
the patch itself.
	Sam
