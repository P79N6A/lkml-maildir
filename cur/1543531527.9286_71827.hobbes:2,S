Here is the DEAL.........
You name the kernel that you bet your LIFE on that is clean......
I will CUSS your NAME as I back port the entire ATA/IDE sub-system to that

linux-2.3.99-pre3-7 ata-code will be backwards carried to that kernel.

Pick your kernel WISELY..........I take the issue at hand very serious!
