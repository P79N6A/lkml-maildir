I thought of some things which could break it, which I want to try and deal
with before releasing a patch.  Specifically, I want to make freepages.min
sacrosanct, so that malloc() *never* tries to use it.  This should be
fairly easy to implement - simply subtract freepages.min from the freemem
part.  An even nicer way would be to subtract freepages.low (or some
similar value) instead of freepages.min for non-root or non-privileged
processes.
BTW, is the 'current' pointer always valid when vm_enough_memory() is
called?  If so, I can remove one redundant check.
My NetBSD friend appears to have found code in the BSD kernel which sets up
ulimit values sensibly by default - eg. it's not handled by the boot
scripts.  Presumably a root process is capable of changing the limits, but
I'm guessing that sensible defaults in the kernel have to be a Good Thing.
