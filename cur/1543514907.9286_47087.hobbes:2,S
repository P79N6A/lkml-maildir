Given the port numbers, these are some kind of chatting between the
various windows boxen on my network. However, I don't remember seeing
the errors before, and find it unlikely that there be so many checksum
errors and only on packets of that kind (I do quite a lot of UDP
traffic). Since I don't use the protocol in question I haven't noticed
any possible adverse effects.
This is on a cheap ISA NE2000 clone on a 10BASET switched network.
