If you burn data in DAO mode you will have the same behaviour. Have you
tried to toggle CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ? It helped me a lot. Also I
have to disable umaskirq, otherwise I have the same problems.
Unfortunately I can't use the latest ac series because of a mysterious
problem with ide-scsi.
One thing I still do not understand is:
IS DMA (theoretically) possible for stuff like c2scans, DAO writing,
audio grabbing? From what I read in the LKML archives and from what
Andre wrote me, I'd say no, but on the other hand I can do a c2scan at
5MB/s with almost no processor usage. Can't really be PIO.
