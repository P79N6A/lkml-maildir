This is really programming 101. This:
static int usb_stor_bulk_transfer_sglist(struct us_data *us, unsigned
int pipe,
		struct scatterlist *sg, int num_sg, unsigned int length,
		unsigned int *act_len)
{
	int result;
	/* don't submit s-g requests during abort/disconnect processing */
	if (us->flags & ABORTING_OR_DISCONNECTING)
		return USB_STOR_XFER_ERROR;
The return USB_STOR_XFER_ERROR; is called an error leg.  It returns
without updating *act_len thus leaving &partial uninitialised.
