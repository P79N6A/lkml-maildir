I found it in the readme file of the nvidia drivers:
<QUOTE>
There are several choices for configuring the NVIDIA kernel module's
use of AGP: you can choose to either use NVIDIA's AGP module (NVAGP),
or the AGP module that comes with the linux kernel (AGPGART).  This is
controlled through the "NvAGP" option in your XF86Config file:
         Option "NvAgp" "0"  ... disables AGP support
         Option "NvAgp" "1"  ... use NVAGP, if possible
         Option "NvAgp" "2"  ... use AGPGART, if possible
         Option "NvAGP" "3"  ... try AGPGART; if that fails, try NVAGP
The default is 3 (the default was 1 until after 1.0-1251).
</QUOTE>
In other words, you use linux's agp drivers.
So it's probably not the agp driver that causes "hangs".
