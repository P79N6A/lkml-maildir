If you are pushing linux-release to Linus/Andrew rapidly, quick fixes 
will land in linux-2.6 rapidly, and more invasive stuff will land only 
in linux-2.6 when the invasive stuff is ready to go.  It even takes the 
pressure off pushing invasive stuff ASAP.
Have you pushed linux-2.6.11.1 upstream yet?  :)
