Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Fix this sparse warnings:
  drivers/net/wireless/ipw2x00/ipw2100.c:5271:6: warning: symbol 'ipw2100_queues_initialize' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/net/wireless/ipw2x00/ipw2100.c:5278:6: warning: symbol 'ipw2100_queues_free' was not declared. Should it be static?
  drivers/net/wireless/ipw2x00/ipw2100.c:5285:5: warning: symbol 'ipw2100_queues_allocate' was not declared. Should it be static?
