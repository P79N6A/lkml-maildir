What tree did you use? The patch I submitted had 
     if (direct_gbpages == GBP_ON) { 
here. And the actual direct gbpages patch does not even have to made
it to Linus' tree yet, just all the other gbpages patches
But yes if it really was if (direct_gbpages) { here then your change
is correct of course.
