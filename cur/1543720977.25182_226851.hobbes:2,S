I stuck some strategic printks in the kernel. The example code's bogus
asm is generating an FPU fault in frstor in its signal handler, that's
bumping us into math_error -> force_sig_info ->
specific_send_sig_info. Then we hit:
        if (LEGACY_QUEUE(&t->pending, sig))
which decides we don't need to send the signal after all and we bail
all the way back out and recurse.
