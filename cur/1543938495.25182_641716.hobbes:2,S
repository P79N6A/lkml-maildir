unfortunately you have not replied to my (rather clear) question. Let me 
repeat the question (which can be clearly seen in the quoted sections 
above). Andi made this assertion:
|  You seem to be under the illusion that iBCS2 support works currently 
|  in mainline and that only this patch would break it.
And you claimed that what Andi says is false:
||  I cannot imagine what brings you to that conclusion.  Suffice to say 
||  you are entirely and inexplicably wrong.
All i did was to ask your proof for why you claim that Andi is wrong - 
i.e. why you think that: "iBCS2 support works currently in mainline" is 
not an illusion. Please give me that proof or retract your statement, if 
it was done in error. v2.6.23 is the current mainline kernel.
