Well, I did consider a similar API, but not for long.
It falls victim to the 95/5 rule---when you engineer an API, if 95% of
the complexity is dealing with the 5% of special cases, you're over
engineering.
So the original proposal is the remaining 5% that covers 95% of the use
cases (and will do better even on the remaining 5%).
