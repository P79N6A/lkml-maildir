   So nobody should better use THIS_MODULE?!
No, it is exactly what they should use.
They should avoid using SET_MODULE_OWNER.
   For ME and many other driver developers SET_MODULE_OWNER does not belong to 
   netdevice, it belongs to the module infrastructure!
   
Then by changing SET_MODULE_OWNER you will break source backwards
compatability for every single network device driver out there,
something I was explicitly trying to avoid.
SET_MODULE_OWNER() is a bogus interface because it is typeless.
Therefore I suggest that you create macros specific to your individual
structures, and use these to achieve 2.4.x/2.5.x build compatability
in setting the ->owner field of such structs.
