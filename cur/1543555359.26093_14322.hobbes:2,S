I think he was mistaken on both counts.
The present 2.4.0test11 only contains the first of his patches.
The 1-line patch below undoes that (and reintroduces some ugliness).

Concerning the case above: a RE entry denotes a relocated
directory, something we do not want to see here, so we
should return a "nothing" value.
The ugly code we used to have made get_rock_ridge_filename()
as called in dir.c return -1, and the code
		map = 1;
		if (we_have_rockridge) {
                        len = get_rock_ridge_filename(de, tmpname, inode);
                        if (len != 0) {
                                p = tmpname;
                                map = 0;
                        }
                }
                if (map) {
			...
		}
		if (len > 0) {
			...
		}
		filp->f_pos += de_len;
		continue;
	}
would make sure that nothing was done with this filename
and f_pos incremented, entirely as desired.
What 2.4.0test11 does is return 0, but now map is still 1,
and the code invents a real filename there, and then
comes with annoying console messages
	Attempt to read inode for relocated directory
So, the old situation was ugly but correct, the new situation wrong.
(I describe this in so much detail because I can readily imagine
that you would like to polish things a bit more.
This get_rock_ridge_filename is also called in namei.c, and
the -1 return value leads to obscure nonsense,
that happens to work today.)
