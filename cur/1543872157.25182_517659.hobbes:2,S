So, what's the state of this?  Is the reduced "allowed to ptrace" check 
good enough for inclusion?  What is needed for some form of this patch 
to be included?  I'm happy to try new approaches if I can get some 
further input.
Another suggestion was to make this an ELF header toggle, and I'm 
generally against that idea.  If a toggle is needed, I'd rather it be a 
system-wide one.
