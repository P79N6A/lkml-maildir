I don't think this will fix the problem, at least not portably.
sleep 1 > filename
will truncate filename before sleep starts, modifying its timestamp at
that point, and leave it unchanged afterwards.  Some systems might
update the timestamp again when the file truncated&opened for writing
is closed, but I don't think this is required.  Worse yet: some
systems don't support empty files, and will error out because sleep 1
produced no output.  Also, since some filesystems don't have 1-second
granularity, you should probably use `sleep 2' instead.
A more portable way to spell it would be:
STAMP = sleep 2; echo timestamp >
or, in order to make $(STAMP) usable in the middle of &&/|| sequences:
STAMP = { sleep 2; echo timestamp; } >
