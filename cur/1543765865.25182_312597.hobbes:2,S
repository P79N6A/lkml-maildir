are you serious?  how is live patching of .text easier than some of
the other suggestions which all are more or less sane and things like
gdb, oprofile, etc. will deal with w/o problems?
patching code in a running process is way complicated and messy,  if
you think this is the easier solution i guess i have little more to
say

that would also be a problem for live patching too, if you have bad
state, you have bad state --- live patching doesn't change that

hand the fd off to another process

no, i can mmap state or similar, hand fd's off and switch to another
process in a context switch... hot patching i bet is going to be
slower
how about you show up some code that needs this?

i honestly doubt in most cases you can hand live patch faster and more
easily than having the application sensibly written and passing it off
please, prove me wrong, show us some code

this is like saying live patching is a complicated in-kernel solution
for badly written userspace isn't it?
