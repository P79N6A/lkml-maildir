Looks like it should work on sane PPC systems as well. :)
# define pfn_to_page(pfn)			(mem_map + (pfn))
is also needed.
After some more thinking, the way to go for deciding whether or not to
use the new code probably isn't by checking the version but by using
some Makefile trickery as there is already for do_munmap and
remap_page_range. Once that is in place, it looks like I can finally
commit it. :)
