So you write a library routine for it. Now that is hard. Its a non kernel
issue.

Incorrect. On an overflow you get a signal without rt information that tells
you there was a queue overlfow

You get a real time signal when there is now data to read, indicating the
file handle.

Which you can do with another thread.
