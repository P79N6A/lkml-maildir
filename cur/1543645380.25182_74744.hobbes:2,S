growing is guaranteed to be false - loop is not necessary.
Actually growing can be removed completely, it's never necessary, 
neither with nor without kmem_cache_reap().
Ed, there are far more cleanups possible in slab.c than just going from 
3 to 2 lists, but IMHO it's far to early to make the design decision for 
2 lists.
Or wait: You want 2 lists? Ok, agreed.
free and partial ;-)
The full list is unnecessary, it's possible to replace it with a 
counter. It also saves several cacheline accesses for the list_del() and 
list_add() into the full list...
