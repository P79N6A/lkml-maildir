Subject: [RFC] support for sysfs string based properties for SCSI (1/3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/3/73

This first patch is of general interest (the other two are going to the
SCSI list only).
The problem this seeks to solve is that we have a bunch of properties in
SCSI that we'd like to expose through the sysfs interface.  The
mid-layer can get their values, but setting them requires co-operation
from the host drivers, thus we'd like to expose a show/store interface
to all the SCSI drivers.
The current one call back per sysfs file is a bit unwieldy for
encapsulating in an interface like this.  what this patch does is to
allow a fallback show/store method of the bus type (if the device type
doesn't exist).  However, the bus_type show/store passes in the
attribute so a comparison may be done against the name of the attribute.
For details of how all this gets used, see the following SCSI patches.
