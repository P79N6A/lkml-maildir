Subject: Large slab cache in 2.6.1

Actually 2.6.1-bk2-nfsd-stalefh-nfsd-lofft (two nfsd patches that 
already made it into 2.6.2 and 2.6.3)

I have 1.5 GB of ram in this system that will be a Linux Terminal Server 
  (but using Debian & VNC).  There's 600MB+ anonymous memory, 600MB+ 
slab cache, and 100MB page cache.  That's after turning off swap (it was 
400MB into swap at the time).
Turning off the swap only shrank my page cache, and my slab didn't 
shrink one bit.
I'm sending this email because this is a production server, and I'd like 
to know if any patches after 2.6.1 would help this problem.
Thanks,
Mike
