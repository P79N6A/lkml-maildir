dump in 2.4 also gets uncoherent view of the data which make things even
worse than in 2.2 (to change that we should hash in the buffer hashtable
all the bh overlapped in the pagecache and no I'm not suggesting that
relax). The only reason it has a chance to work with ext2 is because
ext2 is very dumb and it misses an inode map and in turn inodes are at a
predictable location on disk so it cannot run totally out of control.
