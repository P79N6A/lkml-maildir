OK. We might do very neat and tidy scheme *if* we wouldn't have all kinds
of old binaries kicking around. IMO the very neat one would be simply
open2(fd, name) (+ 2 more variants) that would take an fd and name in
hierarchical namespace and return another fd. Such that read() and write()
there would cover the stuff currently done by fcntl(), ioctl(),
{set,get}sockopt(), chmod(), stat(), utimes(), etc. But it would make
sense if we could drop the old syscalls. That could be done in the very
beginning, but not now. Binary compatibility. I like that idea, since it
seriously reduces the API width and has the right sound (everything is
a file), but we can't do it now. David will kill you if you'll try to pull
that trick ;-) Probably it could be done over 5-6 years, though...
	The main problem with that would be to keep the namespace clean -
otherwise we'ld simply move clutter there.

Look - in that case it's purely HFS business, right? OK, my apologies for
tone (ahem) - 'twas YABDayFH. Sorry.
If this stuff is reasonably small - fine, it's can be done.

Look downthread. new_stat() was tossed.
