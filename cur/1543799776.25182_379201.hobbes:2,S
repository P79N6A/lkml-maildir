It is compiling \o/
The function ptep_mkdirty doesn't exist at all!
A quick grep -r verifies that.
I re-downloaded the kernel tarball and now it is working.
For some reasons the tarball I was using (dwloaded from kernel.org) got
corrupted, but since I was getting an error on ptep_mkdirty(), I didn't notice
it. I thought of ptep_mkdirty as ptep_make_dirty. Damn, the tarball was dirty! 
This is one more reason to begin to learn all the kernel source code.
Well, time to reboot.
