I've told you that it *does* spin and always has. Even with 2.4
kernels. In fact, it is *specified* to spin, anything else would
be a bug.
Caveat: it also yields the CPU, but only if there is another
runnable task with a higher priority (which is meaningless
between SCHED_OTHER tasks, though we try to do something sane
there too).
Secondly, Brian actually pinpointed the source of the
regression and it is not sched_yield(), nor has sched_yield
changed since the regression. So wouldn't this just be a wild
goose chase.
