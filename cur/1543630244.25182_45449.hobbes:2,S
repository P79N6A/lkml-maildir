Generally the defense that "no one else is saying anything" is not a
good one - especially b/c it opens up a huge space for others to agree
with the original argument.  And yes, they are illegible.  
In fact, I believe that when things originally moved to BK, there was
some discussion that although it was a step in the right direction, it
needed to be cleaned up a little bit.
