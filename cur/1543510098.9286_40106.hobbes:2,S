Just a data point here. I can use my 100 MB ZIP drive just fine with
2.3.18-ac7. However, my ZIP disk is USB. It looks like SCSI drive /dev/sda
to Linux because of the usbscsi modules. I'm using the OHCI USB driver.
I have no SCSI controller besides the usbsci module.
I mount /dev/sda4, the partition on my ZIP disk, to /misc/zip just fine
using autofs. I can list directories and copy files just fine.
