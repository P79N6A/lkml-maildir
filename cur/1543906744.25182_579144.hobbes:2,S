is there a method for setting custom baud rates that doesnt cause a
"deprecated" message from showing up ?  for example:
# setserial -a /dev/ttyBF0 divisor 9 spd_cust
setserial sets custom speed on ttyBF0. This is deprecated.
my reading of the serial core code is that the only way to specify a
baud rate that does not appear in the B* define list is by setting
your baud to B38400 and utilizing UPF_SPD_CUST.  this ends up in the
deprecated warning code though in uart_set_info().
if it's deprecated in favor of something nicer, that's fine, but i
cant find out what that "nicer" thing is ...
