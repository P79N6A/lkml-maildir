It is allready mounted noatime:
/dev/mapper/fx1200_vg-fx1200_lv on /z/fx1200 type ext3 (rw,noatime)

Hardware is an Sun Fire X4600 (8xdual-core AMD64 processors). The
problem seem to be tied to this filesystem. (I cannot havent been able
to reproduce it on the /-mounted disk of the same system. So if a cpu
problem.. then it shouldn't be tied to a specific filesystem?
This is the only activity on the system .. so a load of 1 / 16cpus.
The system are generally rock-solid.
