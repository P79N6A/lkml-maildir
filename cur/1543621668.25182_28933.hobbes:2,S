Do you want it just in a post or in-line?
Here's the posted brief version:
Numbers have "integer parts" and "fractional parts", for instance, if
you have a number such as 10 1/2 (ten and one half) the integer part
is 10 and the fractional part is 1/2. The fractional part of a number
x is written {x}.
Now, there is something called the "spectrum" of a number, which for
a number x is the set of all the numbers of the form n * x, where n
is an integer. So we have {1*x}, {2*x}, {3*x}, and so on.
If we want to measure how well a number distributes things we can try
to see how uniform the spectrum is as a distribution. There is a
theorem which states the "most uniform" distribution results from the
number phi = (sqrt(5)-1)/2, which is related to Fibonacci numbers.
The continued fraction of phi is
0 + 1
   -----
   1 + 1
      -----
      1 + 1
         -----
         1 + 1
            -----
            1 + 1
                ...
where it's 1's all the way down. Some additional study also revealed
that how close the continued fraction of a number is to phi is related
to how uniform the spectrum is. For brevity, I write continued fractions
in-line, for instance, 0,1,1,1,1,... for phi, or 0,1,2,3,4,... for
0 + 1
   -----
   1 + 2
      -----
      1 + 3
         -----
         1 + 4
            ....
One way to evaluate these is to "chop off" the fraction at some point
(for instance, where I put ...) and then reduce it like an ordinary
fraction expression.
Fibonacci hashing considers the number p/2^n where n is BITS_PER_LONG
and p is a prime number, and this is supposed to have a relationship
to how evenly-distributed all the n-bit numbers multiplied by p in
n-bit arithmetic are. Which is where the hash functions come in, since
you want hash functions to evenly distribute things. There are reasons
why primes are better, too.
And I think that covers most of what you had in mind.
In my own opinion, this stuff borders on numerology, but it seems to be
a convenient supply of hash functions that pass chi^2 tests on the
bucket distributions, so I sort of tolerate it. If I'm not using a strict
enough test then I'm all ears...
Cheers,
Bill
