I've sought an answer to this problem for a while now, with no luck. It
may be kernel related - I am no longer sure.
I'm having difficulty with my NFS server. All of the other network
machines periodically complain in the following manner:
Jun 14 14:20:57 gene6 kernel: nfs: server gene0 not responding, still
trying         
Jun 14 14:20:57 gene6 kernel: nfs: server gene0 OK            
Jun 14 14:30:53 gene6 kernel: NFS: cache locked for 00:02/553803777
Jun 14 14:35:15 gene6 kernel: nfs: server gene0 not responding, still
trying     
Jun 14 14:35:15 gene6 kernel: nfs: server gene0 OK   
Jun 14 14:35:48 gene6 kernel: nfs: task 63674 can't get a request slot
Jun 14 14:35:51 gene6 kernel: nfs: task 63613 can't get a request slot   
Jun 14 14:35:53 gene6 kernel: nfs: task 63627 can't get a request slot 
Jun 14 14:35:56 gene6 kernel: nfs: task 63659 can't get a request slot
Jun 14 14:36:06 gene6 kernel: nfs: server gene0 OK 
and so on and so on. This happens from every machine on the network. 
gene0 is serving a hardware RAID-5 array (using a SmartRAID IV DPT card).
All systems are running the latest nfs software (2.2beta40). Gene0 is a
dual P2-500. Gene6, used for the example, is a dual P3-500. 
The /etc/fstab in gene6 that mounts gene0's resources is:
gene0:/nfs/disk1 /nfs/disk1 nfs
rsize=8192,wsize=4096,timeo=1000,nosuid,hard,intr,nolock 0 0
Clients are running 2.0.36/2.2.6/7 kernels some with SMP. 
Server (gene0) causes grief with ANY kernel variation, SMP or not
(2.0.36/2.2.5).
