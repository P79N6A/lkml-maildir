Of course there's also the possibility that suspending might abort due
to, say, being unable to freeze all the processes or having no swap
available.
In a situation like that, I wouldn't walk away until I saw it power
down. Besides, we're only talking about waiting 10 or 20 seconds in most
cases (depending on the system's configuration). If you care that much
about the security of your system, you'll be willing to wait.

Nigel
