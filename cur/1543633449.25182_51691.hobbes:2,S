Maybe QoS (Quality of Service) is the answer. It does a lot of things for you, i.e. enabling a scheduler for your network, that shares your traffic correctly. But please don't ask me how it exactly works. I haven't enough time yet to get this nice piece working. You need iproute2-utils for this. (They should be shipped with your distri, "which tc" tells you.)
There're several HOWTOs about this topic. A good address is netfilter.kernelnotes.org where you can find the "Advanced Routing HOWTO" or the Unreliable Guides from Rusty.
Hope this helps.
