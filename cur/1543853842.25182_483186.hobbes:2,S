I see, thanks you. I will take care of that.

Yep, indeed it would be better to have both generic place and sysfs
device to put all these generic displays, however, I think they
shouldn't be at video/* (maybe video/something/* or outside). I mean,
we can do something like:
1. First, we move auxiliary-special displays (including cfag12864b,
[*]"Arc Monochrome LCD board" and stuff like that: they aren't really
primary video displays) to another folder outside video/, maybe
"drivers/display/" ("drivers/auxdisplay/"...).
2. Then we create a sysfs device, called "display" ("auxdisplay"...)
for all of them, which must be generic as you suggested, not just lcds
or "front panels".
So finally we will have usual-primary fbdevs and video drivers at
"drivers/video/*", and all the other stuff at "drivers/display/*" or
some similar place.
Is that a good suggestion?
[*] I saw fbdevs like "Arc Monochorme LCD board support" that can be
put there the same way like auxdisplay/cfag12864b, as they look pretty
similar.
