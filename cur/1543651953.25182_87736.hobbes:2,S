The card id represents a group of logical devices (device ids). It's good
to know how are devices connected, especially for soundcards where are
several logical devices working together (codec, synth, midi uart).
Addressing these devices separately (as the OSS sound driver does for
example) causes a lot of confusion for users when more cards are in one
system.
