Hi.
Current(I'm testing 2008-12-16-15-50 with some patches, though) memcg have
MEM_CGROUP_ZSTAT underflow problem.
How to reproduce:
- make a directory, set mem.limit.
- run some programs exceeding mem.limit.
- make another directory, and all the tasks in old directory to new one.
- New directory's "inactive_anon" in memory.stat underflows.
From my investigation:
- This problem seems to happen only when swapping anonymous pages. It seems
  not to happen about shmem.
- After removing memcg-fix-swap-accounting-leak-v3.patch(and of course
  memcg-fix-swap-accounting-leak-doc-fix.patch), this problem doesn't happen.
Thoughts?
Thanks,
Daisuke Nishimura.
