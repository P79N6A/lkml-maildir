How about doing a LTP run too with some difference file for new FAILs/BROKs ?
That's not strictly a benchmark, but would help catching regressions
quickly.
I notice your benchmark mix is very IO heavy, it would be nice to test other
aspects of the system too. Perhaps lmbench and reaim compute workload?
It would be nice if we had a new linux-testresults list where such
updates could be posted regularly. I don't think it belong on l-k
because it would be too noisy. Perhaps such a list could be added to 
vger. David, what do you think?
