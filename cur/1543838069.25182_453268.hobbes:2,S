With 2.6.18-rc4-mm1, now jiffies and wall_jiffies are always synced.
So we can kill wall_jiffies completely.
Looking how wall_jiffies is used now, I found a potential problem on
arch/ppc and arch/xtensa:
 		if (ntp_synced() &&
 		    xtime.tv_sec - last_rtc_update >= 659 &&
		    abs((xtime.tv_nsec/1000)-(1000000-1000000/HZ))<5000000/HZ &&
		    jiffies - wall_jiffies == 1) {
 
 			if (platform_set_rtc_time(xtime.tv_sec+1) == 0)
 				last_rtc_update = xtime.tv_sec+1;
The condition "jiffies - wall_jiffies == 1" might be correct for
kernel 2.4, but useless now.  So this RTC updating never work.
Though the "11 min RTC update" might be disappeared from the kernel in
the future (any real plan?), it is better to fix this condition
anyway, isn't it?
