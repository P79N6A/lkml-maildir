Hi,
Thank you for your comments.

I agree that the default dirty_ratio is too large.
What I have observed is that write(2) to a disk only with light load is
blocked in balance_dirty_pages() due to heavy write to *another* disk,
and doesn't seem to be the same issue as you say. But decreasing
dirty_ratio shortens the blocking time also in our experiments.

I appreciate for your information.
Would you know about any progress in this issue?
