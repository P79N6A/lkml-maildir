   Its to ensure the pointer is aligned, it also ensures that if it wasnt
   then the kfree of the ring will crash the machine 8)
   Defining a minimum alignment for kmalloc at 16 bytes would be a big help
First, kmalloc is not used here.  pci_alloc_consistent() is.
Secondly, it is freed via the "vp" pointer, so it should be ok.
Thirdly, yes pretty much we need to guarentee some sane minimal
alignment for pci_alloc_consistent() and this ugly line of code
can be removed.
