Are you sure about that?
Check this out:

Also, here are three articles that give a brief mention to 2.2:
PC Week: IT execs express discontent with Windows

PC Week: Databases give Linux an 'in'
http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,383862,00.html
I would say that the mainstream press would be more than "mildly
interested" in this new kernel.
