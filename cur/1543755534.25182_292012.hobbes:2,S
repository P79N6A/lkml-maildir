/proc/iomem or possibly /proc/cpumem.  At least until someone
actually implements hot plug memory support.

For people developing code outside of the kernel I can see where
this is a problem.  Given the insane auditing requirements necessary
to get a reliable code path I don't see how not putting the implementation
in the kernel is sane.  Anything that needs to be touched at that point
is core kernel functionality GPL_ONLY if it is exported at all.
Touching anything from a module at that point is not sane.
Basically the code path setup with crash_kexec is little more
than a jump instruction.  And it should be audited and reduced
as much as possible.  I don't see how you get simpler or what
piece of functionality could possibly improve by having multiple
implementations in kernel modules.
