Technically this is correct.  A bit more back-story though.  802.11s is
still in draft form.  It'll be there for a while yet.  Stuff like
authentication and encryption are in heavy flux.  Previously, the mesh
stuff was using the 4th value in the 802.11 frame type.  But it turns
out that a lot of fullmac parts can't handle that because they drop
those frames in silicon.  So the standard is moving towards using WDS
frames without changing the frame type, which is what the Marvell
implementation is _already_ using.  I repeat, the standard is moving
towards the Marvell mesh implementation.  Furthermore, the CozyBit guys
who wrote the Marvell mesh implementation are heavily involved in the
802.11s standards groups anyway.

Definitely;

Plus the set_region call that can be replaced by whatever the regulatory

I think it's all dependent on the firmware; do you know what version of
the CF firmware you have?  The ledgpio function is apparently from an
older version of the firmware but is still in our 8388 5.x branch.
There's apparently a new command for this sort of thing.

Well, can't the ioctl stuff just return -EOPNOTSUPP or something if mesh
isn't available?
