Second look into sis5513.c and another problem turns out - patch breaks 
support for IDE controllers integrated into 961 and 961B South Bridges
(ATA_133 is used instead of ATA_100 and ATA133a).
For unknown Host Bridges driver checks for presence of 961/961B/962/963
South Bridges by checking true device ID (please see sis5513.c for details) 
and assigns 'chipset_family' accordingly (ATA_100/ATA_133a or ATA_133).
You have 965L South Bridge so probably it has newer true device ID 
and  may also require different programming sequence.
