That is because the sticky bit is "old fashioned". It used to be used
on often-used binaries that it might be better to cache the
code-segment of this binary than to discard it on exit. As this consumes
precious core (*) memory, that operation is considered privileged. 
On modern operating systems (like Linux), the system already does its
best to cache code segments of exiting programs. The sticky bit no
longer has a function. 
On directories, a second meaning was assigned for this bit. This is
not privileged. 
				Roger.
(*) Note the oldfashioned term: This dates back into the time when
Unix ran on machines with 256k core.
