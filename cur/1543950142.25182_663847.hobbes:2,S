please send a patch that changes the help text. For this to happen 
people have to change the default consciously.

i have no strong opinion either way, but i think distributions that ship 
new userspace can legitimately disable this option.
That way once all new distributions have updated userspace we can flip 
the default around and can mark it 'default n'. This at least gives us a 
theoretical path towards getting rid of unwanted legacies. (I suspect 
this was the plan all along, it's just that the clock got restarted now 
with the different legacy/breakage property.)
longer term we could also put in a WARN_ON_ONCE() which kerneloops.org 
would automatically track. That would give an objective metric about 
when to change the default. (and when to get rid of the legacy 
altogether)
