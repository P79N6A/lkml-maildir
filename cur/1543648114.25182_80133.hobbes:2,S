We've had reports of problems with that linear search before - for
a single-threaded application which was mapping a lot of little windows
into a huge file.

This will have no effect on current kernel behaviour other than speeding
it up.  Looks good.

Yup.  We'd need to be able to perform a search based on "size of hole"
rather than virtual address.  That really needs a whole new data structure
and supporting search code, I think...  It also may have side effects
to do with fragmentation of the virtual address space.
