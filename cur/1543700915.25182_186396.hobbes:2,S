I disagree. It's at least not obvious.

I agree that those two cases should be the same. And in fact, those two
cases _will_ be the same by my suggested change ("break out of
'page_referenced()' early")
However, you ignore the third case: a page that is frequently used by 100 
processes.
Such a page behaves differently with the 'break early' behaviour, by 
pinnong the page more tightly. 
And I think that's the right behaviour. At least that's not "obviously 
wrong".
It's not something to do in 2.6.x, but I disagree that it's clear-cut.
