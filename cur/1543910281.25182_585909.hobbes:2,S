Wow, now that's a nice "disclaimer". By your (poor) standards of writing
documentation, one can as well write any factually incorrect stuff that
one wants in a document once you've got such a blurb in place :-)

Oh, really? Considering how much is (left out of being) documented, often
one would reasonably have to experimentally see (with testcases) how the
compiler behaves for some given code. Well, at least _I_ do it often
(several others on this list do as well), and I think there's everything
smart about it rather than having to read gcc sources -- I'd be surprised
(unless you have infinite free time on your hands, which does look like
teh case actually) if someone actually prefers reading gcc sources first
to know what/how gcc does something for some given code, rather than
simply write it out, compile and look the generated code (saves time for
those who don't have an infinite amount of it).

Try _reading_ what I said there, for a change, dude. I'd originally only
said "unless GCC's docs is yet again wrong" ... then _you_ asked me what,
after which this discussion began and I wrote the above [which I fully
agree with -- so what if I used hyperbole in my sentence (yup, that was
intended, and obviously, exaggeration), am I not even allowed to do that?
Man, you're a Nazi or what ...] I didn't go whining about on my own as
you'd had earlier suggested, until _you_ asked me.

What crap. It is _perfectly reasonable_ to expect (current) documentation
to keep up with (current) code behaviour. In fact trying to justify such
a state is completely bogus and nonsensical.
