I've finally got it to work!
I followed the advice from 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/1685
 in
removing the _ke_amd_adv_spec_cache_feature though I'm not sure this was
necessarry
I removed the highmem patch from the make.sh (Also not sure if this is
100% necessary)
I then popped the following lines in my modules.conf:
alias   char-major-226-0 fglrx
alias   char-major-10-175 agpgart
above agpgart via-agp
above fglrx agpgart
and generated a new modprobe.conf file.
You can then setup the graphics card using fglrxsetup
Any way I'm not putting the flags out :D
