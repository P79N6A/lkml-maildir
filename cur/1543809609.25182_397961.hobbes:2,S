You don't bother to mention HOW it is wrong, so it appears it is you who 
fail to learn.  I will attempt once more to explain.  When you call int 
13 and ask it for C = 3, H = 4, S = 5, exactly which sector you get 
depends very much on what the bios thinks the geometry of the disk is, 
because the bios will translate 3/4/5 into a completely different value 
before sending it to the drive.  That translation is dependent entirely 
on which fake geometry the bios chooses to report the disk has.
I illustrated this translation and you simply say it is wrong.  If that 
is the case then show how.
