Hello everyone,
I've been searching through the mailing-list archive but
haven't seen a similar problem report yet, so I'm asking
this here.
We have two G4 dual 1GHz xserves here, they are running 2.4.25-ben1
and working fine, including USB. In the process of upgrading
to 2.6 I had to realize the USB KeyLargo hardware isn't detected.

looks to me like a pci problem as the device obviously isn't even
enumerated. I tried several 2.6 versions, none of them fixed this.
Has anyone had similar problems or even a solution to this?
Any help is welcome.
