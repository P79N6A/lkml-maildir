Being a proud new owner of a DEC Alpha Multia, I've read some comments on
the list about pre9 not working so hot with this box. I did a default
RedHat 5.2 install on my new machine and am itching to use 2.2.0 like
I am on my other boxes around here..
Is 2.2.0p9 safe or should I try the vger CVS tree once the anon. access
is restored?
Thanks!
