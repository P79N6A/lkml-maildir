Depends on what systems you're talking about.  Forcing unused
code into the kernel is not free, especially if that's made into
a design policy and applied repeatedly to many subsystems.

Or if reverse dependencies can't be made to work sanely, then
have those Ethernet-adapter minidrivers depend on NET_ETHERNET
and then select MII.  (To make the relationships be simple
enough that current Kconfig can handle them.)
I have a fair number of usbnet devices.  Not one of them needs
MII or NET_ETHERNET.
