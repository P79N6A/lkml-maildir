To counter clarify:
You are saying two things:
1. The policy always ensures a safe label.
2. Files can be relabeled in a reasonable and timely manner.
I have no questions about 2. It's a hack, but you've already
acknowledged that and it will work, allowing for some potential
cases where someone is overeager about getting a file-in-transition.
Regarding 1: This is a founding premise of the arguement, that
the "policy" is written correctly such that there is no case
where a file gets created with an unsafe label. Given the external
nature of the policy, and the number of attributes used within
the policy, and the overall sophistication of the policy mechanism,
how does one ...
    a. know that a label is "safe"
    b. know that a file will get a "safe" label
    c. know that the policy is "correctly" written as required
The question is not if fixxerupperd can set things right.
The question is about the properly written policy that is
required to make the mechanism worth discussing.

De-nial.

If you already have an in-kernel labeling scheme that you
trust to make the world safe until you get around to doing
the labeling externally you can argue that it's good enough.
But, to quote Cinderella's Stepmother, "I said "if"".
