Why do the CRC in user space, that requires modifying every one of 7000+ applications (if I understand you correctly, which is far from a sure thing;-) )?
Write a reiser4 CRC file plugin.  It would take a weekend, and most of the work would be cut and pasting from the default file plugin..  
I understand why you do it in BK, but for user space as a whole user space is the wrong place.
