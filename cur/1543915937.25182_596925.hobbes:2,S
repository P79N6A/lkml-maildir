The real thing also calls device_power_down(PMSG_FREEZE), which is a
counterpart of sysdev_shutdown(), more or less, and I think that's what goes
belly up.
You can use the patch below (on top of -rc6-mm1), which just disables the image
creation (that should be irrelevant anyway) and see what happens.
Greetings,
