Hi,
I'd like to register a blkdev region, much like
	blk_register_region(MKDEV(major, first_minor), number_minors, 
		            xmodule, xprobe, xlock, xdata);
number_minors is known, but how do I decide what first_minor to use?
Module owns the full major number, so I thought I could use an idr map,
but there does not seem to be a function that marks a range used.
(Something along idr_get_new_range(&my_idr, ptr, &new_id, range_len)
would have been cool.)
Ideas on how to proceed?
Thanks,
Jan
