As someone from LinuxPPC Inc. said in a post to linuxppc-user, LinuxPPC
will always work with Open Firmware. However, BootX will be the oficial
and suppoted method of booting.
I just realized in a state of shock why kernels from 2.1.127 have not been
working for me: I have been doing it the "old way" (quik). All recent
kernels fail to boot becuase they can not read the mac partition map. Of
course, I have mac partition map support compiled in. I finally realized
that this all works fine when booting from BootX. AARRGGG!!! Not only is
this a problem for people who prefer to use quik, but it is a _MAJOR_
problem for people who have machines that don't run MacOS, such as PReP
and CHRP. (Perhaps these kernels work fine on non-pmac machines with Open
Firmware, I don't have the resources to find out.)
So, currently Linux doesn't even work without BootX? I thought that
"future versions of LinuxPPC would work with Open Firmware...".
I would consider the partition map problem a bug, so it might as well be
reported...
Now my choice is between 2.1.125, 2.1.24, and MacOS, until/if Linux
ever works again from Open Firware rather than MacOS... 
I also saw a patch today which added credit to the author of BootX among
many other things? Uhhh.... since when is BootX part of the kernel? I
could go out and write a crappy bootloader for X86 and not get credited
for it. Are the authors of BootMagic, System Commader, quik, and NT's
Bootloader credited for their work just because their bootloader happens
to be able to load linux? The point is that people can use whatever
compatible bootloader they want to load Linux, and these bootloaders are
not a part of Linux, therefore people should not be given credit for
writting bootloaders in the Linux credits. The appropriate place for
credits on a bootloader would be in the bootloader's credits file!
(Imagine that Microsoft gave credits in its credits screens to every
single company that made a PC capable of running Windows....)
