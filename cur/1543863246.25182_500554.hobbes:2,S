Hi!
The update of the IDE layer was in 2.6.19. I don't think it is a 
hardware bug cause all these 5 machines runs fine since a few years with 
2.6.16.X and before. We switch to 2.6.18.6 on monday last week and all 
machines began to crash periodically. On friday last week we downgraded 
them all to 2.6.16.37 and all 5 machines runs fine again. So i don't 
believe it is a hardware problem. Do you really think that could be?
Stefan
