It sounds like your constraining your driver based on terminology.
Watchdogs on most embedded platforms support either a 'reset' mode or
otherwise act as periodic timers, trying to push both of these
functionalities in to a watchdog driver is rather pointless.
CONFIG_WATCHDOG implies 'reset' mode by definition.
If you wish to use your watchdog timer as a periodic timer, simply have a
clocksource/clockevents established for it, leave the watchdog driver as
a reset-only thing, and let the user decide which one they want either
via Kconfig or the kernel command line. (The watchdog driver can just
-ENODEV or -EBUSY if the clocksource is active).
