Hi Ingo
Above patch does solve __ soft_irq_pending __ problem. I am running this patch 
with kernel 2.6.21.1 since last day doing all kinda things but haven't 
encountered any __ NOHZ: local_softirq_pending __. But network lag that I am 
seeing since 2.6.22-rc1 is still there even with this patch applied. If you 
need any more information please do ask. Meanwhile I will do gitbisect as 
suggested by linus to find out the specific commit that introduced this 
problem and will inform once I find it. Its good to see system running 
without any __ local_softirq_problem __ :)
Regards
Ananitya
