I just had an oops with kernel 2.3.5. I had to write down everything
that was on the screen, so I hope I didn't screw up to much.
I think it has to do with with the cache and swapper. I was playing
mp3's, and the more I play, to more get's cached, and he sometimes even
swaps for it. I had an "Sound error: Couldn't allocate DMA buffer", a
minute before it.
Hope this helps
btw: I didn't get any mail from the list for a few days now, again ...
