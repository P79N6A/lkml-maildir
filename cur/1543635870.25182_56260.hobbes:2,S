Commands:
0xf5 - n/a - Keyboard
  Reset and disable keyboard. The keyboard performs a reset to a power
on state (without affecting the LEDs) and stops generating events.
0xff - 1*R - Keyboard / Mouse
  Reset and perform the Basic Assurance Test (BAT). Device returns a
BAT completion code 0xaa. If it's a keyboard, then switches to scancode
set 2. If it's a mouse, it also sends 0x00, 0x03 or 0x04 after 0xaa.
Since BAT is also triggered on power-on, a device will send 0xaa
immediately after being plugged in.
Responses:
0xfe
  Resend. Keyboard will send this if it didn't receive the last command
correctly.
Unfortunately, 0xfe also happens when you send a command to a keyboard
that's not plugged, or when the keyboard doesn't understand the command.
Resending in those cases (which are the most common) would cause an
infinite loop ...
