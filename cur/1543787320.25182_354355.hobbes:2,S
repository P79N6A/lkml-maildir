I like this one much more than the other patch aswell, because suspsending
is an ULDD operation, not an LLDD one, and this fits the layering model
much better.  The only complaints here are cosmetics:
 - generic_scsi_suspend/generic_scsi_resume are misnamed, they should
   probably be scsi_device_suspend/resume.
 - while we're at it they could probably move to scsi_sysfs.c to keep
   them static in one file - they're just a tiny bit of glue anyway.
 - get rid of all the CONFIG_PM ifdefs - it just clutters thing up far
   too much.
