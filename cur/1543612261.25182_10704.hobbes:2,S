see, their might be either API provided by DLL (ethernet, ATM, FR etc) to
network layer (IP, IPX etc) to sent packets over a physical device. Now, the
Network protocol field can be passed through the API to be filled in by
DLL header by DLL. Another case may be, DLL can easily know what's the ifIndex
the packet is coming from. Network layer might have registration policy by
ifIndex to DLL, which can be used now to infer Network layer protocol id.

I didn't understand what did you mean by "ethernet device doesn't add any
header but change the output device"? May be after you explain a bit more I
can suggest something more.
