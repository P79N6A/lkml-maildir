Subject: HPA patch doesn't  work on my SATA, kernel-2.6.18

Hi,
.
I want to remove HPA in SATA, I was recommended to
follow this linux-ide site.
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-lde@vger.kernel.org/msg05215.html
I want to remove HPA area under Kernel-2.6.18.
But after patching ,I couldn't see anything like HPA
in dmesg and fdisk information.
There is no difference between before and after patch.
Now I am using SATA 250GB includes HPA, 11GB.
And I installed HDPARM7.3,which support SATA, to get
some information.
But there's nothing related to my SATA 250GB, HPA.
In the output of "HDPARM -I /dev/sda" there is a
device size, 239GB, but that doesn't include HPA area.
Could you please tell me which kernel patch, program
or commands to use in order to remove HPA area under
Linux ?
