Linus,
The proper way of fixing this is to add #ifdef MODULE around the init
functions or going back to init/exit_module. 
I know it looks ugly, but because of the structure of the 
scsi subsytem this is the only way out besides doing a nasty hack
to scsi.c. And even with the hack, the initialisation functions
will get called twice which is wrong.
I guess the scsi subsystem is in need of an overhaul for 2.5.
Patches have already been sent to you for sd (me) and sr (Jens Axboe).
