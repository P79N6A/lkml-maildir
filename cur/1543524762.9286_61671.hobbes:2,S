Hmmmm.  You could split out the three files that could be duplicated
(wd33c93.o, 53c7xx.o, NCR53C9x.o) from everything else...
  -obj_$(CONFIG_SCSI_SGIWD93) += sgiwd93.o wd33c93.o
  +obj_$(CONFIG_SCSI_SGIWD93) += sgiwd93.o
  +auxobj_$(CONFIG_SCSI_SGIWD93) += wd33c93.o
  -obj_$(CONFIG_SCSI_MCA_53C9X) += NCR53C9x.o mca_53c9x.o
  +obj_$(CONFIG_SCSI_MCA_53C9X) += mca_53c9x.o
  +auxobj_$(CONFIG_SCSI_MCA_53C9X) += NCR53C9x.o
Then you can optimize auxobj_y and auxobj_m without touching obj_y.
A hack?  Yes, horrible.  But I would still like it better than the
current makefile.
