Somebody *please* tell me I hallucinated the posting that said AppArmor
restricts the use of chroot by confined processes...
In any case, the incredibly brittle behavior of this policy in the face
of chroot() failure (from the people who should *know* how to write AppArmor
policy, no less) is just proof of why making it simple for non-experts to
write policy is a Bad Idea....
