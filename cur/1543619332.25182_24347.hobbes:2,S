Well, this is what tags are for.  The ambiguity in changesets is OK,
since it's possible anyhow with multiple people (and with some creative
work maybe, 'c' would be before 'd', but at the same level, so 'c'
wouldn't get 'd', but this might break the new behavior so..)  But if
you do:
a b (tag v1) c e (tag v2)
             d
	     f (added after the v2 tag)
it should be possible to have the 'v2' tag say what changsets it had, or
even what rev of each file it was made to.
Larry, how does BK handle this now?  Ive been thinking about this for a
bit and am kind of curious now..
