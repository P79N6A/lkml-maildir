Hum, its not quite 10 right now (and hopefully won't be again soon) It did

This machine is ftp.debian.org - two days ago it sent out a more than 180G
of traffic (145G via FTP, rest HTTP/rsync) over a 1 day period. Which is
what, 1/7th the size of cdrom.com? We run Apache and wu-ftpd (though we
switched to proftpd two days ago..) Machine is PII-350, 256Meg ram and a
3x9G RAID5 on a ICP Vortex RAID controller 
The biggest load generator is really rsync, followed by proftpd, both when
they do ls -LR's :< I don't get a feeling that schedualing is a big
concern here.
Enjoy,
Jason
