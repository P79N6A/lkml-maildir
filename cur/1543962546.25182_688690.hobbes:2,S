By the way, are you worried that there is something wrong with this
trace?  Your write went out in a single PCIe packet, so it looks perfect
to me.  Does the "Mem MWr(32)" worry you?  I can't see why it would be a
problem -- the PCIe TLP only has one type of memory write transaction
(well, except for 32-bit or 64-bit addressing, but you don't care about
that), and memory write transactions are sent as a string of 32-bit
chunks, so there's no other way a 64-bit write could be sent.
