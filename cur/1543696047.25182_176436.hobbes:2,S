Hello!
I am using 2.6.0test9 and I have an empty /proc/acpi/battery dir:
scice:/usr/src/linux# ls /proc/acpi/battery/
scice:/usr/src/linux#
What can I do to debug this and to read the battery states?
My computer does not have an apm bios anymore, so I can't access it
this way.
It's the egs elitebook a530.
Any ideas? Any more information you need?
Nico
