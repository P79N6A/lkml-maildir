That's not the problem, I think.
2.4.0 was appropriate for the time. The problem with _any_ big release is
that the people you _really_ want to test it won't test it until it is
stable, and you cannot make it stable before you have lots of testers. A
basic chicken-and-egg problem, in short.
You find the same thing (to a smaller degree) with the pre-patches, where
a lot more people end up testing the non-pre-patches, and inevitably there
are more percieved problems with the "real" version than with the
pre-patch. Just statistically you should realize that that is not actually
true ;)

I'd love to do that, but it doesn't really work very well. Simply because
whenever the "stable" fork happens, there are going to be issues that the
bleeding-edge guard didn't notice, or didn't realize how they bite people
in the real world.
So I could throw a 2.6 directly over the fence, and start a 2.7 series,
but that would have two really killer problems
 (a) I really don't like giving something bad to whoever gets to be
     maintainer of the stable kernel. It just doesn't work that way:
     whoever would be willing to maintain such a stable kernel would be a
     real sucker and a glutton for punishment.
 (b) Even if I found a glutton for punishment that was intelligent enough
     in other ways to be a good maintainer, the _development_ tree too
     needs to start off from a "known reasonably good" point. It doesn't
     have to be perfect, but it needs to be _known_.
For good of for bad, we actually have that now with 2.4.x - the system
does look fairly stable, with just some silly problems that have known
solutions and aren't a major pain to handle. So the 2.5.x release is off
to a good start, which it simply wouldn't have had if I had just cut over
from 2.4.0.
The _real_ solution is to make fewer fundamental changes between stable
kernels, and that's a real solution that I expect to become more and more
realistic as the kernel stabilizes. I already expect 2.5 to have a _lot_
less fundamental changes than the 2.3.x tree ever had - the SMP
scaliability efforts and page-cachification between 2.2.x and 2.4.x is
really quite a big change.
But you also have to realize that "fewer fundamental changes" is a mark of
a system that isn't evolving as quickly, and that is reaching middle age.
We are probably not quite there yet ;)
