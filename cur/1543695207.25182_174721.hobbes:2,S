Uh Oh...
Is this a fix for the problems I reported back in June
to LKML and to Pam Delaney?
On June, 12th, I sent a mail to Pam reporting system freezes
I had on an ASUS AP 1700-S5 server with onboard 53C1030
controller. In this mail I speculated about the possibility
of a mixed device configuration beeing the source of the problem:
[...]
Another idea: is it possible that the SCSI controller
has problems with U160 and U320 SCSI disks mixed together
on the same bus? As far as I know there shouldn't be a
problem with this combination, but who knows?
I always tested with a mix of the following SCSI disks:
IBM DDYS-T18350M (18GB U160 SCA)
IBM IC35L036UCDY10-0 (36GB U320 SCA)
I'm currently running 2.4.20 with 4 U320 disks and no
U160 disk in the how swap cage. The system is now up for
about 6 hours and no SCSI timeout occured so far (this
doesn't say anything. Sometimes it takes 24 hours before
a SCSI timeout or even a freeze occurs)
[...]
I haven't got an answer to this report, but with a
all-U320 configuration I never had system freezes since.
Does the new driver now work in a U160/U320 mixed
configuration, too?
