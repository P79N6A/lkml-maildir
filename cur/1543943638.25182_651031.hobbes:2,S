Subject: [PATCH] make KVM selectable again
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Current git for me (b1d0e4f535e10775cffde922208b49629169aeaa) doesn't
let me build KVM.  In fact, I don't seem to have *ANY* kvm-related
symbols in my .config at all.
I've verified that arch/x86/kvm/Kconfig was getting run by putting some
comments in it.  It seems to me like just putting:
	config HAVE_KVM
	       bool
isn't letting anything come into my .config at all.  I'm not sure why we
do that, and then have:
	select HAVE_KVM
in arch/x86/Kconfig.
This patch just defines HAVE_KVM in the x86 Kconfig and is done with it.
Seems to work for me.
Was there some reason that it was done this way?  Was it ever tested?
