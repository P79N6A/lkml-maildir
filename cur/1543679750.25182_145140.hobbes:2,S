I have a T20 and a NE2k network card and have been experiencing a similar 
hang when I start cardmgr. I did some playing around with it and found 
some inconsistencies. 
At first, I had it in Slot 1, and it hung when probing the first range of 
addresses. I moved it to Slot 0, and it was able to probe and bring the 
interface up (though it did complain heavily about dropping packets). 
After a few reboots, it started hanging during the address probe (in Slot 
0). I tried disabling various memory regions to probe in 
/etc/pcmcia/config.opts, and had luck initially, but it now has decided to 
not work at all. 
I also have a Cisco/Aironet 340 802.11b card that is having problems. When 
in Slot 0, cardmgr can idenitfy the card, and the driver initalizes the 
card properly, but I cannot obtain an IP address (but does not hang). In 
Slot 1, the system hangs while trying to obtain an IP address. 
Any ideas?
