Unless you have redefined EFAULT in some strange and hideous way, it is 
not "called" and doesn't free the spinlock.  EFAULT is defined as a 
literal integer, so you're just returning a number without freeing the 
spinlock. 
If you have redefined EFAULT to a macro function call or whatever, then 
don't do that, it's REALLY horrible coding practice.
