David, 
I've must install Linux on AMD386 DX40, HD Maxtor 160MB, 8MB RAM for 
this task i used kernel 2.0.39. 
When I compiled kernel 2.0.39, I noticed some `warnings` which I
corrected as mentioned previously.
Then I inspected the VM subsystem code, where found any stuff 
that could be cleanup and improved, such as: 
+#define clear_page(page)       memset((void *)(page), 0, PAGE_SIZE) 
+#define copy_page(to,from)     memcpy((void *)(to), (void *)(from),
PAGE_SIZE)

LOL!
The main reason this patch is cleanup and better code standartize. 
I think thats code cleanup is good reason too!
