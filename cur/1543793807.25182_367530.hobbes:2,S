Ok.  This was a ploy to avoid lots of code churn which has bitten us.
The separation here is to indicate that pfn_to_nid isn't necessarily
safe until after the memory model is init'd.  When the code was
initially implmented we only used pfn_to_nid in init code so it wasn't
an issue.  What we need to do here is break this link and make sure each
user is using the right version.
I'll go and put together something now.
