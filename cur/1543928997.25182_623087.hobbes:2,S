In a tight loop there is a way to do a single symbolic lookup and  
just call directly through a function pointer, but typically it isn't  
necessary for GUI programs and the like.  The flexibility of being  
able to dynamically add new methods to an existing class (at least  
for desktop user interfaces) significantly outweighs the performance  
cost.  Any performance-sensitive code is typically written in  
straight C anyways.
