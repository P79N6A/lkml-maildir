Calling sync() is a Bad Thing as far as performance goes. It holds the
global kernel lock for quite a long time. On a production server, that
_would_ cause things to grind to a halt for the duration of the flush. On a
workstation, it'll not do too much harm. The kernel thread kflushd does (or
should do) what bdflush does anyway.
