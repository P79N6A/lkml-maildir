GPIB is terribly device-specific. What board do you intend to use?
National Instruments has a so-called driver for their TNT4882 on
their web-site. I was never able to get it to even compile, much
less work.
I have a driver written for that chip. It's not GPLed, but it
could be if there is enough interest. In any event, I could send
you the source to try out. Just don't publish it yet. Let me
know because I could use additional input for testing. In other
words, if asked, I would just say that you are helping to test
a driver...
Cheers,
