	Personally I'd like to see a Linux system *not* dependant on DOS for
such things.  The idea of a vendor-specific key to enable writing to the
flash makes alot of sense to me.  So does a jumper, but a jumper requires
more manual intervention and probably taking down the machine, which is
something I don't like doing. :)
