I don't think that is needed anyways.  It would seem to 
be overkill to me to make a relatively fast path slower
just for the profiler interrupt.
I think the idea was that the spinlock functions should be small 
enough that they don't have any stack local variables. In this case 
for the standard non FP build you can just use *regs->rsp. The only problem
was with CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER, because then the compiler puts
an additional word onto the stack. I think the right way 
is to just correct for this word and still use rsp.
Here's an untested patch to implement this. Does this fix the problem for 
you?
