OK, I just re-read your initial posting, and see you have a 70GB RAID,
so 1GB free is about 1.4% free, which makes for bad performance no
matter what filesystem you have.  In general, ext2 will have this 1%
free space spread evenly across all of the disk, so while 1GB is still
a lot of space, it is still a nearly full filesystem.
Cheers, Andreas
