ok. Meanwhile i found another counter-argument: the average committed 
file size is 36K, which with gzip -9 would compress down to roughly 8K, 
with the commit message being another block. That's 2+1 blocks used per 
commit, while with deltas one could at most cut this down to 1+1+1 
blocks - just as much space! So we would be almost even with the more 
complex delta approach, just by increasing the default compression ratio 
from 6 to 9. (but even with the default we are not that bad.)
case closed i guess. (The network bandwith issue can/could indeed be 
solved independently, without any impact to the fundamentals, as you 
suggested.)
