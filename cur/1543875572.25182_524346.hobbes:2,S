I'm worried about some broken controllers I know of that might indeed
swallow the interrupt if it occurs, we ack it, then disable it, and
later on re-enable it...
I think the main case I have in mind (pmac-pic) has the necessary
retrigger all over the place but there is definitely a change in the
flow of disabling/enabling here.
Anyway, I'll run some tests tomorrow and make noise if I find something
broken, though I can't test the various embedded thingies in
arch/powerpc.
Ben.
