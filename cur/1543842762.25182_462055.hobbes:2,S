Actually with xchg I can use a reference counted struct pid lockless.
In the general case you have more then one variable you want to keep
in sync and you need the lock for that.
rcu is definitely not the solution in these cases as the struct pid
is stored for a long time so we need the reference count.
It might make sense to have some helper code makes that wraps
the following line so it is obvious you can do this.
put_pid(xchg(&vc->vt_pid, get_pid(task_pid(current))));
Perhaps:
void update_pid(struct pid **ref, struct pid *new)
{
        struct pid *old;
        get_pid(new);
        old = xchg(ref, new);
        put_pid(old);
}
But since I can write it as a moderately clear one liner in the
case that matters I don't much care.
