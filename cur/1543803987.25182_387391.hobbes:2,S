Hi,
I'm working on superpages, targeted at Itanium, and I just updated
the WiKi page to explain a bit more where I'm at.

We're also looking at other things, like completely abstracting out
the 3 level page table to allow us to experiment with VM schemes more
appropriate for large, sparse address spaces and superpages.
This is far from realistic migrate into the kernel stuff (so not
really for here), but if sufficient (say 5 or 10) people drop me a
reply email to say they're interested I can start a low-traffic list
where we can discuss long term (far-fetched?) VM implementation ideas,
share patches, etc.

Yes, I'll look at putting something in there too.
