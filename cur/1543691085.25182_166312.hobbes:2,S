Subject: exporting register_chrdev_region and friends?

I've been playing with the registration of char devices in the brave, new,
big dev_t world, and that means looking at register_chrdev_region() and the
cdev_ functions.  But, it seems, these functions are not exported to
modules.  That's easily fixed, but I was wondering: is this omission
deliberate?  Should modules be able to use those functions to access larger
device numbers, or is there some other interface envisioned that modules
should be using?
Thanks,
jon
