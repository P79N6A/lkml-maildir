BTW, 6.4ms schedule latency sounds insanely long for a RR task, are you
running a PREEMPT=n kernel or something?
How would you characterize the log tasks behaviour?
 - does it run long/short (any quantization)
 - does it sleep long/short - how does it compare to its runtime?
 - does it wake others?
   - if so, always the one who woke it, or multiple others?
