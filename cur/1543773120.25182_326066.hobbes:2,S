Currently tmpfs reuses the simple_dir_operations from libfs.c.
Would it make sense to add the empty fsync() function there, and have 
all other users pick it up as well?  Is this likely to break stuff?
Currently the following code uses simple_dir_operations:
./kernel/cpuset.c
./security/selinux/selinuxfs.c
./ipc/mqueue.c
./include/linux/fs.h
./fs/relayfs/inode.c
./fs/debugfs/inode.c
./fs/ocfs2/dlm/dlmfs.c
./fs/autofs/inode.c
./fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c
./fs/libfs.c
./fs/ramfs/inode.c
./fs/devpts/inode.c
./net/sunrpc/rpc_pipe.c
./mm/shmem.c
./drivers/misc/ibmasm/ibmasmfs.c
./drivers/oprofile/oprofilefs.c
./drivers/isdn/capi/capifs.c
./drivers/usb/core/inode.c
./drivers/usb/gadget/inode.c
