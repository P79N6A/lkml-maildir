Subject: [PATCH] fix warning in tdfxfb.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/6/16/43

This patch is obviously correct.  It doesn't appear that tdfxfb has a
maintainer, so I'm sending this patch to the list.  Nothing
earth-shattering, it just removes a warning during build.
