The tipps from vmware support at

seem to help, didn't get a "lost some interrupts" warning during the 
last 2 days. But, I got one "many lost ticks" warning:
Apr 23 23:06:51 baum kernel: warning: many lost ticks.
Apr 23 23:06:51 baum kernel: Your time source seems to be instable or 
some driver is hogging interupts
Apr 23 23:06:51 baum kernel: rip __do_softirq+0x4f/0xd0
What I did was
- setup VM host OS to 1000HZ, preemptible kernel
- VM clients use 100HZ, and kernel options "clock=pit nosmp noapic 
nolapic"
- VM client kernels are all non-SMP compiled now.
Still, some kind of documentation in the Linux source tree would be 
nice, explaining what that message means and how to fix it.
