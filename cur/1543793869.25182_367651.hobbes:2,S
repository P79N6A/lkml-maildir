I still don't get it.
Once nfs_writepage() has been called, the page is conceptually "under
writeback", yes?  In that, at some point in the future, it will be written
to backing store.
Hence it's perfectly appropriate to run set_page_writepage() within
nfs_writepage().  It's a matter of finding the right place for the
end_page_writeback().
