That will fix it.

Nah, it's __block_fsync().  That function has to write buffers against
a particular device.  So it searches the global buffer LRU for 32 buffers
against the nominated device, drops the lock, writes the buffers, then
searches again.
So the search complexity is O(n*n/32).  Which means that when you have a
lot of dirty buffers against different devices on the queue the CPU cost
simply explodes.
One workaround is to use sync rather than fsync - because sync uses NODEV
and doesn't have to search past buffers from uninteresting devices. 
Another is to do what you've done.
Probably, just syncing the buffers at i_dirty_data_buffers would suffice.
That would fix it.
