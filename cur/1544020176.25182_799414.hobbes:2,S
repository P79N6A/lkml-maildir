Although not all SSDs identify themselves, including the one on my
eeepc. So to get the benefit you have to tell the kernel manually. The
ability to do this was merged into mainline yesterday. (/me resolves to
test it).
http://git.kernel.org/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=1308835ffffe6d61ad1f48c5c381c9cc47f683ec
Anecdotally it was worth switching from CFQ to NOOP. CFQ caused
seconds-long hangs (with the SSD light solidly on); with NOOP this
happens far less often. I don't know or care if it halved throughput,
but I can't bear to use a system that hangs for seconds on end :-).
