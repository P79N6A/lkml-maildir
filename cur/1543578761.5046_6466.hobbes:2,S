I got the following error while building 2.4.0-ac9:
shmem.c:971: `shmem_readlink' undeclared here (not in a function)
shmem.c:971: initializer element is not constant
shmem.c:971: (near initialization for 
`shmem_symlink_inode_operations.readlink')
shmem.c:972: `shmem_follow_link' undeclared here (not in a function)

make[2]: *** [shmem.o] Error 1
It looks like changes were recently made to linux/mm/shmem.c.
