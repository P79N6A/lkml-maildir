Any thoughts on what kind of allocation patterns do we have for those
critical callers? The worst case is of course that for just one 32
byte critical allocation we steal away a complete page from the
reserves which doesn't sound like a good idea under extreme VM
pressure. For a general solution, I don't think it's enough that you
simply flag an allocation GFP_CRITICAL and let the page allocator do
the allocation.
As as side note, we already have __GFP_NOFAIL. How is it different
from GFP_CRITICAL and why aren't we improving that?
