btw., would be nice to somehow untangle consciously-exported interface 
definitions from kernel side bits, and standardize these 
feature/capability flags like __KVM_HAVE_IOAPIC, etc.
Right now we have this body of 75,000 lines of code spread out in 600+ 
header files that are so-called 'exported' to user-space, but 95% of that 
interface definition code is never being relied on by any user-space bit! 
They are exported due to cargo-cult mentality or due to dependencies.
It would be far better to have an explicit place for such bits, 
include/syscall-ABI/ or so - and not export _any_ other kernel headers. 
But that's a much larger project.
