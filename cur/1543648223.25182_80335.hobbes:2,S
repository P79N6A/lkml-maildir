Ok, everything applied.
I only have one more comment - my Intel contacts tell me that the people
working on vtune are trying to make it play together somewhat with
oprofile, and that they are already talking to you.
Quite frankly, as long as the vtune user-level tools are all proprietary,
I don't really care all that much about vtune compatibility, but if it
turns out to be easy and convenient we might as well try to be polite
about it (and apparently they've sorted out all the issues with their
kernel-level code, and are happy to do that stuff all GPL'd, but since
it's pretty useless without the tools..).
Thanks,
		Linus
