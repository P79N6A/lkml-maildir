silentoldconfig gives you exactly the same information. Both conf and 
oldconfig will change invisible options without telling you, so it's not 
exact at all.
If you can't trust a silent oldconfig, a more verbose oldconfig can't tell 
you anything else, if it would it's a bug.

This is enough reason to simply hijack conf and use it for your own 
purpose without even asking the maintainer about the intended bahaviour?

It _was_ working like that, you're breaking it.

So simply use silentoldconfig.
