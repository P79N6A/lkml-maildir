   Can't it go the other way? Instead of mass-promotion of the setup 
   functions, can't we demote the ones that are causing the problems? 
   
There's this middle area between core and subsys, why not
just be explicit about it's existence?
Short of making the true dependencies describable, I think my
postcore_initcall solution is fine.
