General caution.
It is generally harder the change mistakes in the kernel than it is to
change mistakes in userspace, and similarly it is easer to add
functionality and configurability in userspace.  A design that puts
the control in userspace is therefore preferred.  A design that ties
you to working through a narrow user-kernel interface is disliked.
A design that gives easy control to user-space, and allows the kernel
to do simple things simply is probably best.
I'm not particularly concerned with code size and code duplication.  A
clean, expressive design is paramount.

If the kernel and userspace both need to know about metadata, then the
design must make clear how they communicate.

Primarily the latter.  But also that the act of enumerating them may
cause an update to an underlying devices (e.g. metadata update or
resync).  That is what I am particularly uncomfortable about.

Maybe if arrays were auto-assembled in a read-only mode that guaranteed
not to write to the devices *at*all* and did not bd_claim them.
When they are needed (either though some explicit set-writable command
or through an implicit first-write) then the underlying components are
bd_claimed.  If that succeeds, the array becomes "live".  If it fails,
it stays read-only.

Choice is good.  Competition is good.  I would not try to interfere
with you creating a new "emd" driver that didn't interfere with "md". 
What Linus would think of it I really don't know.  It is certainly not
impossible that he would accept it.
However I'm not sure that having three separate device-array systems
(dm, md, emd) is actually a good idea.  It would probably be really
good to unite md and dm somehow, but no-one seems really keen on
actually doing the work.
I seriously think the best long-term approach for your emd work is to
get it integrated into md.  I do listen to reason and I am not
completely head-strong, but I do have opinions, and you would need to
put in the effort to convincing me.
