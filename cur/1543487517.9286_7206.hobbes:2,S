Perhaps I am missing something, but I believe this is dealt with on
Sparc already in a more clever and efficient way (the idea is actually
by Van Jacobson to the best of my knowledge, his is the earliest
implementation of this "trick" that I am aware of)).  The algorithm,
in pseudo assembly, is:
retry: ldd	 [xtime], %reg1		/* load all 8 bytes of xtime */
       ld	 [timer_reg], %reg2	/* snapshot timer counter */
       ldd	 [xtime], %reg3		/* load second copy of xtime */
       cmp	 %reg1, %reg3		/* Did it change in between? */
       bne	 retry			/* Yep, try once more */
        nop
No locks, no interrupt disabling, etc.  I suppose using this technique
would be extremely troublesome if the architecture in question has no
method to load an aligned doublet of time_t's at once.  But I believe
ix86 actually can.
Perhaps this solves a different problem than the one you are
tackling...
