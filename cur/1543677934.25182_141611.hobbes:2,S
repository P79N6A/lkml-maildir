It looks fine to me, although I do not think this is as critical an
issue as it was for 2.5, because the per-processor bloat is not nearly
as bad in 2.4 as 2.5. Nonetheless, this does not actually break
anything.
Except, I notice in some places (namely, 64-bit architectures), you set
the default NR_CPUS value to 64. While this ought to work if
sizeof(unsigned long)==8, it might not and is probably not a change we
want in a stable series. The default should be 32 all around.
