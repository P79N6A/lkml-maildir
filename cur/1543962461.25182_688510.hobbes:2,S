I read an article not long ago about a guy running an AMD renderfarm.
He was working on power management techniques, including suspending
systems that weren't in use.  It made a huge difference in power costs,
apparently.
I believe suspend is also used in some virtual server farms where
physical systems are resumed and virtuals are migrated to satisfy higher
CPU demands.
I could also see using it combined with a load balancer or proxy to
bring up backup web or database servers.
Compared to using networked/USB power bars or management controllers to
bring systems up and down, suspend/resume provides a faster response.
