64-bit clean, big-endian clean and uses (read|write)[bwl] are basically
the three things some drivers don't get.

serial ports, RTC aso are implemented on the SH4 chip itself iirc.

It does (The SH3 and SH3e do too). What might be more of a problem for
the sh3 port is that chip does not have an FPU.
