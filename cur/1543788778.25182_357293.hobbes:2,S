Unfortunately I didn't think I'd be back this fast. I built the new
kernel and rebooted. The boot starts, gets down to the point where it
tells me that the preempt debug stuff is on, and then jumps to an
endlessly repeating error message:
init[1]: segfault at ffffffff8010fce0 rip ffffffff8010fce0 rsp
00007fffffcb09b8 error 15
This error repeasts endlessly until I reboot.
Good thing I had another kernel I could boot back into! ;-)
So, something isn't happy. Is this a -rt thing or a kernel issue?
Cheers,
Mark
