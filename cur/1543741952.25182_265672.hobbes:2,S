As far as nmeter can tell, this a rough cpu usage pattern between RT-U3
and RT-V0.4.3, during my jackd + 6*fluidsynth "benchmark" tests:
  cpu usage                    RT-U3.0    RT-V0.4.3
  ---------------------------- ---------- ---------
  system (kernel)              <10%        10%
  user                          30%        60%
  ---------------------------- ---------- ---------
  total                        <40%        70%
The following table compares the state between my RT-U3 and RT-V0.4.3
configurations, regarding only the mentioned options:
  option                       RT-U3.0    RT-V0.4.3
  ---------------------------- ---------- ---------
  CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB              n          n
  CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT           y          y
  CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP    n          -
  CONFIG_PREEMPT_TIMING          n          n
  CONFIG_RWSEM_DEADLOCK_DETECT   -          y
  CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER           y          y
  CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW     y          y
  CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE       n          n
  CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC         n          n
(dash "-" means that the option is not available in the config).
As you can see, it can only be CONFIG_RWSEM_DEADLOCK_DETECT, being new in
RT-V0.4.3, that is probably affecting on RT-V0.4.3. I'll try to rebuild
and test all over without it, and see if it gets any better.
