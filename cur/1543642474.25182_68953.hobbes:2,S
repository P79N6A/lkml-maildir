Subject: [patch] Version 2 of the Linux IPMI driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've cleaned a few things up and fixed some minor bugs.  The only big 
change is renaming the "unused" address to the "system interface" 
address (which makes a heck of a lot more sense).  I'm working on 
userland tools that will tie in to this and to LAN/ICMB stuff, and there 
I saw the need for the name.  I still haven't tested interrupt-driven 
operation, but that's really a rather minor concern since almost no 
boards support it and the driver will work without it.
You can get the patch on my web page at 
http://home.attbi.com/~minyard,
 
relative to 2.5.33 or 2.4.19.  The patch is fairly self-contained, so it 
should be easy to port to other kernel versions.
The lanana guy is not available for a while, so I'm not getting a device 
number in the near future, but I think it's ready for the 2.5 release. 
 Does this need more time, or is it ready for inclusion?
