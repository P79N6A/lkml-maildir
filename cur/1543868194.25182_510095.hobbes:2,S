I think you are reading Lexmark wrong. First off, Lexmark ruled that
scenes a faire applied to the toner-level calculation, not "make a
toner cartridge that works with a particular Lexmark printer." It was
the toner-calculation algorithm that could't be done any other sane
way, which made the TLP unprotectable via copyright. The opinion says,
"Both prongs of the infringement test, in other words, consider
'copyrightability,' which at its heart turns on the principle that
copyright protection extends to expression, not to ideas."
You're saying that there's no other way to interface device drivers to
an operating system than the current Linux driver model? That's
strange, since it's a different driver model than Linux had
previously, and it's also different from the BeOS driver interface,
etc. If the Linux driver interface is protectable, it doesn't seem
like scenes a faire applies.
