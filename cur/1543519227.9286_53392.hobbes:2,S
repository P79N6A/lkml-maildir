I've been following the kernel patches and realized that the Version Number in
'include/linux/version.h' hasn't been updated since 2.3.26. This might break
some drivers that have #ifdefs that rely on kernel versions > 2.3.26.
I've been updating the version number locally on the past few downloads, but,
is it just me or is anyone else seeing this?
