NFS has the concept of unstable storage, that is a state where it is
agreed the page has been transferred to the remote server, but has not
yet been written to disk.

see: /proc/sys/fs/nfs/nfs_congestion_kb
That is the limit for when the nfs BDI is marked congested, so
nfs_writeout + nfs_unstable <= nfs_congestion_kb
The nfs_dirty always being 0 just means that pages very quickly start
their writeout cycle.
