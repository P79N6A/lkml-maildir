Good question, I need some advice. The Xen hcall headers get soft-linked into every paravirtualized OS tree: linux, bsd, solaris, etc. In linux right now the xen version.h shows up as  /include/asm-xen/version.h.
This file uses typedefs for every important parameter. For example, typedef char [1024] xen_capabilities_info_t;. 
But as Greg says TYPEDEFS ARE EVIL. 
Last resort would be to use the funky gcc #include_next to override the xen hcall headers with a linux-specific hcall headers. But I don't know if that would be cool with lkml either. 
So, advice would be welcome :). 
thanks, 
Mike
