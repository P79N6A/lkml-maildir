I remember I once had to add an empty default case in a switch/case in one of
my programs to stop gcc from complaining. I think it is the same here and the
'default' does not harm anyway.
And please remember, as a rule of thumb, if it does not change semantics nor
the code produced, please try to avoid moving parts of the stable kernel.
There are many people who have to apply other patches on top of a vanilla
kernel and who don't like it very much when they get rejects just because
of a recent code "beautification".

Willy
