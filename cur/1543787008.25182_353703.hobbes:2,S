Note detected is too strong a word.
Watchdog driver generally can't detect that
the appropriate watchdog hardware is present.

I notice you are loading multiple watchdog drivers
which will probably clash with each other.
You need to identify the watchdog on the motherboard
and only load the appropriate module. Google suggests
the driver could be i8xx-tco or w83627hf?
I wrote the w83627hf driver and did a recent change
to fix immediate reboot on module loading on certain systems.
The cause was when the BIOS starts the watchdog with
a timeout of X minutes, the hardware is in "minute mode".
However when the watchdog loads in changes it to "seconds mode",
causing a reboot within 4 seconds in your case.
The good news is if the machine is rebooting within 4 seconds
of loading the w83627hf module then you know that it is
the appropriate module to load, and a fix is available.
Other watchdog drivers may have the same issue.
