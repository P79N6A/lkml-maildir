I don't mind doing it this way, it's just that from what I saw all 
current applications use the sys interface, so I figured that people
would like to be able to use those.

This is not the impression that I got - I got quite a few responses from 
people that were using my driver with the hdaps applications that use sys.
I just saw gentoo have a package for it and they are using the sys 
version for the most important feature of this device: HD protection. I 
got hdapsd to work a while
back, so if in-tree hdaps did not change the interface, it should still 
work with mdps as well.
Debian/Ubuntu also have some stuff for hdaps in their repositories. So 
it seems to me that people are using the sys interface.

I agree that the sys interface is probably not the best choice, but the 
accelerometer data should provide not only position, but also generate 
an event when it detects
that it's falling. From what I understood hdaps does not have that info, 
but mdps and ams do. I am open to suggestions regarding the proper 
interface assuming it exposes the free-fall events as well,
since if you can get an interrupt from the device it's a hell lot better 
than polling it and doing some heuristics to detect that it's falling. 
This is especially true for mdps, since each read is rather expensive
CPU-wise. I will think about the interface more when I get some more 
free time.
