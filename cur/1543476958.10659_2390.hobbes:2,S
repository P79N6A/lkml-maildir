Since C++ has no support for modular programming (shame for modern language)
aven genious compiler could not do anything with this sample. Since compiler
is NOT aware about lack of this usage in foofunc while compiling foo1.C and
thus could not remove it's usage there and thus could not remove it's usage
in foo2.C as well even if foofunc is not virtual ... Programmer should do this
by hand by declaring foofunc as static :-) So instead of writing some things
in program (like C case) with C++ programmer must always think about compiler
and what compiler will do with all definitions :-(( So stated goal: free
programmer mind from implementation details for other things is not accessed...
