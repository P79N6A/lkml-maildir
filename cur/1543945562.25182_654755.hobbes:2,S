Fedora 8 / x86, Dell D610, ipw2200
testcase:
1. boot into runlevel 3
2. log on as root on tty1
3. start wpa_supplicant
2.6.25-rc1-git4 is okay
2.6.25-rc2 BUGs dumping stack on console, but nothing gets in /var/log/messages
2.6.25-rc2-git1 BUGs dumping stack on console, ONLY this in /var/log/messages:
Feb 16 16:51:49 sandman kernel: BUG: rwlock recursion on CPU#0,
wpa_supplicant/2342, c0440220
Will now look for changes between -rc1-git4 and -rc2... .config files
 are the same for the two kernels, and available if needed.
I might be able to provide full stack via netconsole, but there's some work
 to do to set it up.
thanks,
