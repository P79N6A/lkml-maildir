Subject: [patch 104/104] jbd: ordered data integrity fix

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Hidehiro Kawai <hidehiro.kawai.ez@hitachi.com>
commit 960a22ae60c8a723bd17da3b929fe0bcea6d007e upstream.
In ordered mode, if a file data buffer being dirtied exists in the
committing transaction, we write the buffer to the disk, move it from the
committing transaction to the running transaction, then dirty it.  But we
don't have to remove the buffer from the committing transaction when the
buffer couldn't be written out, otherwise it would miss the error and the
committing transaction would not abort.
This patch adds an error check before removing the buffer from the
committing transaction.
