The reason I needed that patch is that I was not using 2.4.5aa1 but a
corrupted tree (I'm been fooled by an hardlink during developement), it
was just two lines away from the real one.
So this is the fix for all 2.4.5 based trees (ac1 and aa1 included) to
get generic and dp264 compililations right:
