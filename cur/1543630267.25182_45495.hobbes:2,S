Sorting might help a tiny bit...
I thought about this, when I saw the 2.4.x changelogs.  Typical GNU 
projects seem to have a pretty decent system going -- there is a 
detailed ChangeLog, and an abbreviated high level summary NEWS, for each 
release.
So IMO a good solution would not be to change the format of the BK 
changelogs, but to supplement them with the type of summary that looks 
like the "old Linus" changelogs, i.e. a summary generated by a human:
    Martin Dalecki - IDE updates
    Al Viro - VFS updates
    Andi Kleen - x86-64 update
    ...
The central complaint about BK changelogs seems to be that they are too 
verbose for a quick scan of what a new kernel version contains.  (while 
at the same time lauding the additional information BK provides over the 
old changelogs)
Marcelo gave it a good shot, by (it appears) generating a summary by 
taking the first line of each cset.  The better solution would be a 
human-generated NEWS file.
