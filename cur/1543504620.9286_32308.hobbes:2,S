Actually, I've been looking for a way to lock down chunks of user memory from
within the driver I'm writing without the permission check in mlock.  Is there a
clean, exported interface to this?  Or perhaps it would be enough to set some
bit in the page tables (other than the dreaded reserved bit -- that would
probably trash the user program anyway).  The kernel code to do this did not
seem to make much sense, but I'm no expert in the memory subsystem.  Thanks!
