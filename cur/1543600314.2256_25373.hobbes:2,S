It doesn't work on BSD either. The manpage says:
(
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getpeereid&sektion=2&apropos=0&mnpath=OpenBSD
+Current)
     getpeereid() returns the effective user ID and group ID of the peer con-
     nected to the UNIX domain socket s.
     One common use is for UNIX domain servers to determine the credentials of
     clients that have connected to it.
It is not possible to get a creditential from TCP connections yet. That
requires an extension to IPSec to even be able to carry credentials. There
is no reliable communication path (even for identd) to be able to pass
credentials.
