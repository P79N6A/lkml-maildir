Subject: [PATCH 22/39] NLKD - core
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The core NLKD additions.
With other debugging code living scattered across the (official or
external) tree(s), this tries to atb once establish a common place
for debugging code in a new debug/ directory.
Note that this depends on the i386 cmpxchg adjustments patch, which
isn't in 2.6.14, but has supposedly been merged already into 2.6.15.
