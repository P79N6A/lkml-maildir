Moves a bit too fast for me to be able to keep up, but I'll try to hang
out there more than I have been  :)

As I later mentioned, this won't necessary give honest picture of
performance implications, since some namespaces might need to be
frequently referenced, in which case the extra indirection from
task_struct->container->nsstruct may give a big hit.
But perhaps I can use the utsname ns on top of the experimental
container patch to test that aspect.
