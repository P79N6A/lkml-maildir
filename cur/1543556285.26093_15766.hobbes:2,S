This sync_buffers corruption is fixed by Jens' patch, which is present
in test12-pre3.
However it is possible that the original list_head-based corruption which
I reported will not be fixed by this patch. This is because none of the
structure offsets match up with what I observed, and because Lawrence's
sytem is "SCSI-only" - no SCSI drivers are headactive.
Lawrence, did you see this problem with test12-pre3?
