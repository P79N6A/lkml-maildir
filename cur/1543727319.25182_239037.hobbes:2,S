So, I'm confused. David, James, and Brian all have GPL code, and Jari
has distributed his code with other GPL code (1) and labled his own
code as GPL (2) even though hes complaining about it (3) being in the
kernel without his permission, right?
1) Doesn't this make his code GPL as well?
2) If #1 doesn't, doesn't this?
3) If #1 or #2 make his code GPL, then he isn't allowed to revoke our
right to use GPL code written by him, right?
If I've missed something, please tell me. Im also confused why anyone
_wouldn't_ want their code in the kernel; I consider it a great honor
to have a patch accepted with my code in it, etc.
