hi,
the subject says it all, basically.
I've been using kernels 2.0.35,36 and 2.2.0pre6 and 2.2.0ac2 and 2.2.1
on axp built for a 164LX and a Ruffian(164UX) board (compiled with
various compiler versions including 2.7.2.3 and egcs-1.1.1).
The rtc-driver seems to work nicely as long as you only look at the
values in /proc/rtc. But as soon as you try to use hwclock, this program
will wait forever.
The way I understand it, things work like this:
 hwclock starts, sends an ioctl to /dev/rtc to set update_irq to
 yes (and I can see this in /proc/rtc) but ususally (i.e. on ix86)
 you should get an interupt as soon as the next second starts.
Same is true for the test-program in linux/Documentation/rtc.c.
BTW: the homepage link for p.gortmaker in linux/MAINTAINERS seems
to be outdated.
with kind regards (mit freundlichen Gruessen),
                                     Ruediger Oertel (ro@suse.de)
