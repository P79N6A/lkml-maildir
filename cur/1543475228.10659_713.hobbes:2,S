I have compiled 2.2.0-pre4 for my smp system and run across some minor
problems. First of all the DMA-Support seems to be broken. In 2.2.0-pre1
it worked just fine, but in 2.2.0-pre4 it says, that dma is broken for my
first IDE drive. As hardware hasn't changed it must be a problem with the
IDE driver. Second problem is a minor one. Just a wrong detection on the
SCSI bus. I have a Yamaha CDRW writer attached to an Adaptec 2940 AU
controller. At initiliasation it detects it as a 6x/6x writer, which is
definitly wrong. It's an 6x reader, 4x CD-R and 2x CD-RW writer. Seems as
if both writing speeds were summed up instead of counted indepently.
Greetx!
