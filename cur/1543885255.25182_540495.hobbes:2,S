I just want to solve the current issue, and decide the proper way for Trent's fixes. 
I consider you a very skilled programmer. Unfortunately, it seems that
you're not interested anymore on submitting kernel patches, since your
last contribution, as an author, were back on Aug, 8, 2006:
        commit bbdd11fa957913d6648cabbca59be1da479180ed

            V4L/DVB (4432): Fix Circular dependencies

It would be a pleasure to have you contributing again. However, we need to fix the pointed issues.
Also, considering that:
1) the Trent patches addressing the issues exists since august, 2006;
2) nobody pointed any troubles at the current approach;
3) the patch does provide a proper fix for module removal, working well on both hardwares with and without DST;
4) I'm responsible for reviewing and forwarding patches for /drivers/media stuff;
I think there's no reason for me to not forward the proper fixes to mainstream.
