It shouldn't do much besides printing the file content.
An strace -ftt might help to find what it's wasting it time with.

I had to change this, it's now "make prepare".
Putting it at the end of *config was an unfortunate choice, as it was 
updated independent of whether the config step left a valid config or not 
and with the fixed dependencies it even may have triggered a unexpected 
call to silentoldconfig (e.g. just by quitting xconfig/menuconfig).
bye, Roman
