If an application is single threaded then it cannot be doing both at
the same time - so all we need to do is flush and invalidate mappings
at the start of I/O. This is really only needed for the range covered by
the direct read/write.
If an application is multithreaded and is doing mmap and direct I/O
from different threads without doing its own synchronization, then it
is broken, there is no ordering guarantee provided by the kernel as
to what happens first.
