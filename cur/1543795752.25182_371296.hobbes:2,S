Having played a few months with a machine installed with advfs, I
can say that I *loved* this FS. It could be hot-resized, mounted
into several places at once (a bit like we can do now with --bind),
and best of all, it was by far the fastest FS I had ever seen. I
think that the 512 MB cache for the metadata helped a lot ;-)
