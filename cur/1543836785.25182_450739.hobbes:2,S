(sorry for the delay, too much travel/conferences)
I agree with your ordering.  Linus wrote about the current
ARCH_HAS* (and HAVE_ARCH* I suppose):
  "WE SHOULD GET RID OF ARCH_HAS_XYZZY. It's a disease."
I have patches for some of these that I will post soon (prob.
Monday), converting several ARCH_HAS* to CONFIG_ namespace.
