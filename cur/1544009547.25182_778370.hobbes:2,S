What is the best way to check if there is a memory leak?
If I start a ping running on my system using the rtl8187 driver, and nothing
else active on my system, I see an increase in the "slab" value in /proc/meminfo
of about 65 kB/minute. Is this indicative of a memory leak? When I run the same
test with p54usb, the increase is only 20 kB/min.
Thanks,
Larry
