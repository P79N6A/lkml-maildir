Bill, it's not like Opersys is VC-funded or anything of that type.
We're a self-sufficient operation and as such we cannot afford to
waste any time. So when I dedicate close to 6 weeks of man time
to a given project, you bet I'm going to take it seriously.
I have no objection to let things cool off, but it's a lot to
ask that I do not take seriously attacks on our ability to
produce objective results.
We can leave it at that if you want.
