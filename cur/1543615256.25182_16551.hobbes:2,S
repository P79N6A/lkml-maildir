Nope - I'd much prefer aeb's small partx for the same job :)
In fact it can be cut down even more than the current version. which is
30k dynamically linked against glibc.  In fact a striped down version
wouldn't need a libc so this would be about the size.
It supports dos, solaris, unixware and bsd partitions so far.
