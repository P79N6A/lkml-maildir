For example, for the sake of argument, if the VMI ABI consisted only of 
a single call:
  #define VMI_CALL_NOP           1
then obviously it would be very hard for VMI to adopt to changes in the 
kernel - no matter how many smarts you put into paravirt_ops :-)
agreed? That is the center of my argument. Does the VMI ABI limit the 
Linux kernel or not?
As we increase the complexity of a hypercall ABI, more and more things 
can be implemented via it. So _obviously_ there is a 'minimum level of 
capability' for every hypercall ABI that is /required/ to keep the Linux 
kernel 100% flexible. If in some tricky corner the ABI has some stupid 
limit or assumption, it might stiffle future changes in Linux.
i am worried whether /any/ future change to the upstream kernel's design 
can be adopted via paravirt_ops, via the current VMI ABI. And by /any/ i 
mean truly any. And whether that can be done is not a function of the 
flexibility of paravirt_ops, it's a function of the flexibility of the 
VMI ABI.
