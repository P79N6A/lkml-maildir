It's not hard to do read-side, right?  Take the list of sysctl's, and
create a program which reads it via the binary interface and the /proc
interface, and verify they are the same.  
Testing write-side, where we have to worry about permission tests,
making sure the correctr value is set, locking issues, etc., is
admittedly more difficult.  My guess though many programs/libraries
are reading from the sysctl interface than writing to it.
