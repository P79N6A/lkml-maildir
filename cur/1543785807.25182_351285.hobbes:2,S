Did you compile the program under a x86_64 kernel, distro? I ask because
it doesn't compile for me. On my machine asm-i386/user.h and
asm-x86_64/user.h both do not contain a user_regs_struct definition with
x86 registers.
Another thing I noticed was that with the patch %eax was zero for the
failing program although I didn't see how the patch affects %eax.
