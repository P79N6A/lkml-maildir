well, those poor folks who do not have ethernet
devices for networking :)
seriously, what I think Eric meant was that it
might be nice (especially for migration purposes)
to keep the device namespace completely virtualized
and not just isolated ...
I'm fine with that, as long as it does not add
overhead or complicate handling, and as far as I
can tell, it should not do that ...
