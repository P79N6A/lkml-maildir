Hi!
I had a temporary disk failure (played with acpi too much). What
happened was that disk was not able to do anything for five minutes
or so. When disk recovered, linux happily overwrote all inodes it
could not read while disk was down with zeros -> massive disk
corruption.
Solution is not to write bad inodes back to disk.
