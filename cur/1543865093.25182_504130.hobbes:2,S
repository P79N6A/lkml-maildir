No at the time I don't think I powered it off, and I suspect that is
probably what went wrong.  The windows driver probably didn't like the
state of the chip after linux had poked it.

Well it must have just been the state of some registers then.

I suspect I can't.  I still can't make it connect successfully to
anything yet, but that could just be a configuration problem, or it not
liking WPA encryption yet.

I have just mainly seen messages about devicescape from the ralink
driver.

Sometimes I might be.  At least on the days I have to deal with problems
in Windows (it's not even my machine, so I don't get to pick what it
runs all the time. :)  I haven't had particularly much luck getting a
stable wireless going on linux yet, although I haven't put much effort
into it yet either.  I figure in a couple of years there will be so many
wifi devices around that wireless won't work anymore anyhow so it isn't
a high priority.  I like simple trustworthy wires.
