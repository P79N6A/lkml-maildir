I'm moving towards swapping over networked storage. Admittedly a new
feature.
Like with pretty much all other swap solutions; there is the fundamental
vm deadlock: freeing memory requires memory. Current block devices get
around that by using mempools. This works well.
However with network traffic mempools are not easily usable; the network
stack uses kmalloc. By using reserve based allocation we can keep
operating in a similar matter.
