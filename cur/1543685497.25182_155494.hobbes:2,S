Well, it might be easy to separate user mode blocking in filesystem
operations as opposed to usermode sleeping on file descriptors on a file
system type base. 
But maybe we do not need to differentiate anyway, perhaps we can somehow
detect blocking reads which stress the hardware, vs. blocking reads which
actually lowers the load. Perhaps we need a fd flag for that, where FDs
pointing to fifo, socket and pipes will be free, and FDs pointing to some
devices (e.g. not tty) and files will be tainted and get penalty on
blocking.
Another optimisation would be to only penalt a blocking process if there is
more than one, to avoid renicing processes on otherwise unloaded but slow
systems.
