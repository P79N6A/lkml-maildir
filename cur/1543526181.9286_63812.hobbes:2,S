Subject: Status of (SMP?) fs corruption bug in 2.3.x?

Late January, I posted a bug report in the thread "Corruption w/
2.3.41-pre2", where the major theme seemed to be that people with SMP
systems occassionally got filesystem corruption (symptom:
"Input/output error" when accessing newly created files).  I
experienced the problem several times with 2.3.3x and 2.3.4x kernels
after using Debian apt to upgrade my system.  Yesterday with 2.3.45 I
unpacked 2.3.30 and patched up to 2.3.45, and afterwards several files
in the source tree were similarly corrupted.
I haven't seen any resolution to the problem on l-k.  Is the problem
on AC's ToDo list ("Truncate races (Debian apt shows it nicely)") the
cause of these problems?  If so, is there anything a non-novice but
non-kernel hacker like myself can do to help track it down?
Apologies if this has already been resolved, but I'd really like to
help squash this one (aside from this problem, late 2.3's have been
dramatically more responsive on my SMP system so I'm loathe to go back
to 2.2...).
