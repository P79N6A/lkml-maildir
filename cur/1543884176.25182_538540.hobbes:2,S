/sbin/hwclock freezes the whole box for me turion x2 with nvidia mcp51 
(HP Pavillion dv9210us), but only when syncing hwclock to system time.  
I suspect it could be a hwclock IOPL bug, but I will have to check 
source to be sure.  But I see this with 2.6.20 Gentoo kernel, not just 
2.6.21, so I think it is a different bug.
