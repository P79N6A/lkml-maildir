Subject: [PATCH 00/13] spufs fixes and cleanups

In a review almost a month ago, Al Viro found numerous
problems in the current spufs code. I now finally found
some time to go through those and attempt to fix them.
There are also a few other changes in this series that
should also help, in particular improved interrupt
sending and an abstraction for priviledged register
access (as suggested by  Masato Noguchi and Geoff Levand).
Please apply to powerpc.git before sending spufs upstream.
Al, could you have a look over this to see if it addresses
all the concerns you had and if I broke it in new ways?
