Not if you actively disable detection!
Why would you want to be able to disable detection?  Well, your BIOS

That is because 2.6.20.11 incorrectly disabled EDID detection when a
non-VESA mode was chosen as the initial mode.  This is a bug.

You're complaining that we didn't query EDID when you *explicitly* asked
us not to.  This is not a bug!
