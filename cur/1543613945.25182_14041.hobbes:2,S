So? That's never been an essential ingredient of bazaar-style development  
(though it can, of course, be rather useful).
And it's been long known that forums for successful projects, like l-k,  
tend to grow until key developers look for another forum because they just  
don't have the time to follow. It's unfortunate, but not everyone is Alan  
Cox.
But, once a project *has* grown like that, there is usually another venue  
(or several) available for those key developers. And remember, this being  
open source, everyone who has the necessary basic expertise and enough  
time can *become* one of them.
