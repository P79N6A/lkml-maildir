     Thanks, but the amount of data a 3.5 floppy stores really doesn't make
that very workable except for very low resolution images.
     At this point, CoolPix 950 is at the top of my list, since a number of
list members were so kind as to point me to the existance of gphoto
(www.gphoto.org) which does support that camera, and I received mail from
several saying that they were using it with that camera and that it worked
well, I feel comfortable going that route. 
     Also, I'm told the format used on the memory cards is just a DOS file
system, so I ought to be able to get a SCSI card drive and just mount it on a
Linux box as a DOS file system. 
     I can't say how thrilled I am to have found out there is a way to do this
without having to go to a Mickeysoft box...  Now if these stability problems
on 2.2.x under Sparc SMP systems can be solved...
     With the patches various people sent applied, now the machine lasted five
days before a crash which is just about a record for 2.2.x on this box, this is
on an SS-10 with quad hypersparc CPU's.  I'll post further details when I find
them, someone rebooted while I was asleep so I don't know if it was the usual
crash or something different yet.
