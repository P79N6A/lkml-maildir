"s" as in "sync"?  But its not sync.

The real problem I guess is that "aio" isn't clear enough, as there
are different types of async io.  Maybe generic_posix_aio_* versus
generic_file_aio_* - *shrug*, thats probably not much better really.
Pretty much anything would be better than do_sync_write (describing
buffered not-sync writes) though. :)

Heh - yes, thats the one (you have a contradiction in terms there -
if its the former, its not the latter ;)

Well, yeah - maybe - getting a bit long winded, but thats possibly the
best option so far.

Hmm.  I imagine the author of the fs code would quickly find out they'd
made that mistake though, and it'd fail in a fairly easily debuggable
way, so perhaps not really a big issue in practice.
cheers.
