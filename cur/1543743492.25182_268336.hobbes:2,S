What about connecting? I am pretty ignorant of USB inner workings
but when I took a glance there seems to be a lot of preparations
before device is ready to be probed...

Never say never ;) That was the first thing I did after playing with
PCI devices when I tried doing what Tejun did.
If kernel advertises an userspace interface it will be used. I can see
myself wanting to disconnect my hub and all its devices so my wireless
explorer does not use batteries and I do not want to figure out what
port it is connected to... Someone else will find another reason,
I don't know.
I also think that even PCI should kill children devices behind a bridge
if bridge driver is disconnected to manage resources in more strict way.
But I think that would require notion of generic/specialized driver and
require automatic rebinding of specialized driver over generic one so
every PCI device has a driver attached to it.
