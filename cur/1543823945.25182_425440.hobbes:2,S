Yeah, this is nice-looking stuff, thanks.
Beware that the code which you've borrowed from ext2 has had several really
subtle problems over the past few years.  Stress-testing of this new code
(especially on small-blocksize filesystems and under memory pressure) might
reveal defects.  Still, it could hardly be worse than the present situation.
Does anyone know of a good way of creating UFS filesytems under Linux?  I
had a go at porting BSD ufsutils a few years ago and nearly died.  There's
http://ufs-linux.sourceforge.net/,
 but that hasn't been touched in a couple
of years..
