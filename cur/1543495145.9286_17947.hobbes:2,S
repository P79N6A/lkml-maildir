This seems to be a common problem with VP3/MVP3 systems when mixing
transfers between UDMA and non-UDMA devices. E.g. I get it when
transferring from my non-UDMA AOpen-40x cdrom to a UDMA Maxtor.
For now the solution is to disable UDMA on the Maxtor when doing transfers
to it from the cdrom. Other device transfers work fine with it in UDMA
mode, but not the CDROM.
