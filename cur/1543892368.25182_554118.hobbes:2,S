I agree that's the right place for real user processes, but I note
that there are drivers that have kernel threads that do basically
this:
	if (signal_pending(current))
		dequeue_signal(current, ...);
for example, drivers/block/nbd.c, and obviously they don't want to
still see signal_pending(current) after they have dequeued all the
pending signals.
