Sorry guys, I should have written a followup yesterday. I did solved
Ralf's problem for him. It was due to some paths not agreeing on when to
use clustering for a request and when not to -- for some historical
reason, MO drives have clustering disabled. The easy (and correct
solution, IMO) is to just allow clustering if the host permits it. So
the patch to solve the problem is as follows, also sent to Marcelo
yesterday.
