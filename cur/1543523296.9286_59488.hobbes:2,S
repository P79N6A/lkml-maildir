Dave, meet /dev/sdq. /dev/sdq, meet Dave. Dave, pay attention to /dev/sdq

Umm... Will /proc/drivers/block/<driver>/ranges make you happy? I.e.
$ cat /proc/drivers/block/ide/ranges
0300(80)
1600(80)
2100(80)
2200(80)
$ cat /proc/drivers/block/ide/hdb/range
0340(40)
(and yes, it's _range_ - keeping device numbers for partitions in
non-contiguous area is the way to madness).
