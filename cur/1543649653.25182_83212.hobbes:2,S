But the code you sent has all of the ACPI stuff not enabled, right?
As an example from your patch:
+enum php_ctlr_type phphpc_get_ctlr_type()
+{
+       return PCI;
+}
It never returns any other type, so the ACPI or ISA sections of the
driver will never get called.  Or am I missing something?

So this overloads the current Compaq driver?  It looks like this "new"
driver will also handle all of the same controllers the current Compaq
driver does, right?  If not, it sure looks like you are accepting all of
the same PCI ID values :)

Thank you for making this change, I appreciate it.

Thanks.

And replaced with the odd BEFORE_2_5 check :)
Please just rip these out and send a version that is only for the 2.5
kernel.
Some of your #ifdef CONFIG_IA64 should be moved to header files only
(and probably documented why you really need to sleep extra amounts for
ia64 machines only.
What's the #ifdef WORK_QUEUE for?

The code looks _very_ similar.  In fact, at first glance it looks like
almost a straight copy of the existing Compaq code.  Why not just submit
a patch against that driver that adds the extra functionality that you
need for your hardware?  That would be much smaller, and decrease the
amount of duplicated code in the kernel tree.
Also, why doesn't the ACPI PCI hotplug driver work for your machines?
I've seen it work on a very wide range of processors (i386 and ia64),
and manufacturers, and any specific issues with your hardware would
probably be better addressed with patches to the existing ACPI driver.

Great, I do too.  Please, make a proposal about what to merge into the
core.  I do NOT want to see another driver have to duplicate the PCI
resource management code again without a very good reason for doing it.

There's no rush, let's work together to get this done properly.
thanks,
