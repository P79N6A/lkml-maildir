I've just had a look at the Documentation/devices.txt file included
with kernel 2.2.9, and the obvious solution based on that file would
be to swap the definitions of majors 0 and 42 over. For reference,
here are the relevant definitions therein:
 Q>  0	Unnamed devices (e.g. non-device mounts)
 Q>	   0 = reserved as null device number
 Q> 42	Demo/sample use
 Q>	This number is intended for use in sample code, as well
 Q>	as a general "example" device number. It should never be
 Q>	used for a device driver that is being distributed; either
 Q>	obtain an official number or use the local/experimental
 Q>	range. The sudden addition or removal of a driver with
 Q>	this number should not cause ill effects to the system
 Q>	(bugs excepted.)
 Q>
 Q>	IN PARTICULAR, ANY DISTRIBUTION WHICH CONTAINS A DEVICE
 Q>	DRIVER USING MAJOR NUMBER 42 IS NONCOMPLIANT.
The basic problem is to determine what sort of effect this particular
change would have on driver development, as it's the sort of change
that could easily be implemented.
Whilst I'm talking about devices.txt, can I confirm the status of the
so-called alternate serial devices? If, as I've been told, they have
now been discontinued, would I be right in assuming that the following
char major numbers are all now obsolete:
	5, 18, 20, 23, 25, 33, 44, 47, 49, 72, 76 and 79.
Also, block major 40 is apparently obsolete. Is that correct ???
Finally, I note that major 28 is listed as having two conflicting
definitions both as a character major and as a block major. Is this
correct?
Personally, I'd like to see the system completely redone in 2.3, and
would propose something along the lines of the following (assuming 32
bit node numbers):
 1. Split the node number into three subfields as follows:
     a. The most significant byte specifies the Category.
     b. The next two bytes specifies the Major.
     c. The least significant byte specify the Minor.
    This allows for 256 categories, each with 65,536 majors in them,
    and each major can have 256 minors in it.
 2. Define nodes with Category 0, Major 0 as "Compatibility nodes",
    and arrange for the kernel to convert each to the equivalent new
    node number, as appropriate.
 3. Define nodes with Category 0, Major >0 as "Development nodes".
 4. Define other categories as follows (this list for block devices):
	Category	Major	Definition
	~~~~~~~~	~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~
	    1		 All	Experimental
	    2		  0	Floppy discs
			  1	EIDE primary channel, master drive
			  2	EIDE primary channel, slave drive
			 3-4	EIDE secondary channel
			 5-6	EIDE tertiary channel
			 7-8	EIDE quaternary channel
			 9-10	EIDE fifth channel
			11-12	EIDE sixth channel
			13-14	EIDE seventh channel
			15-16	EIDE eighth channel
			17-32	EIDE 9th-16th channels
			 33+	Other non-SCSI discs
	    3		 All	SCSI hard discs
    Other categories are defined as required.
 5. Specify that all hard disc categories shall use the minor to
    select the appropriate partition on the device, with minor 0
    specifying the entire device and minors 1 through 255 specifying
    partitions 1 through 255 on the device in question. This allows
    far more partitions per device than are currently available, and
    also does not differentiate between device types when allocating
    these limits.
Also, one fairly simple means to ensure that compatibility nodes were
used as little as possible would be to arrange for the kernel's mknod
service to translate any request to create a compatibility node into
one to create the equivalent new node.
Comments?
