At first sight jiffies and wall_jiffies increase monotonically, and
wall_jiffies always has a value jiffies had a moment earlier, so the
difference jiffies - wall_jiffies ought to be nonnegative.
On the other hand, do_gettimeoffset() is a much more obscure function,
and the jumps are also explained if that can return a negative value.
Depending on CONFIG_X86_TSC it does do_slow_gettimeoffset or
do_fast_gettimeoffset. Both offer plenty of opportunities to
return a negative value. Things depend on hardware details.
So, instead of adding a test inside { } I would propose to catch
problems after the {}, e.g. by
	if (usec < 0)
		usec = 0;
There should be a clue in the fact that the jump happens at the
start of a new second. I don't know what it is.
