somehow i doubt you're quoting Xeon numbers w/2MB of cache above.  in
fact, here's a 701 specint with only 512KB of cache @ 2GHz:
http://www.spec.org/osg/cpu2000/results/res2002q1/cpu2000-20020128-01232.html
my point was that if you had comparable die sizes the 15% "advantage"
would disappear.  there's a hell of a lot which could be done with the
approximately double die size that the itanium 2 has compared to any of
the commodity x86 parts.  but then the cost per part would be
correspondingly higher... which is exactly what is shown in the intel cost
numbers.
a more fair comparison would be your itanium 2 number with this:
http://www.spec.org/osg/cpu2000/results/res2002q4/cpu2000-20021021-01742.html
2MB L2 Xeon @ 2GHz, scores 842.
is this the itanium 2 number you're quoting us?
http://www.spec.org/osg/cpu2000/results/res2002q3/cpu2000-20020711-01469.html
'cause that's with 3MB L3.
