Mmm, thats pretty close, Bill.  Maybe its something I just noted the 
last time I tried to burn a disk under ide-scsi, but I caught it 
turning the write speed down to 8x from the 12x setting.  It may have 
been doing that previously without advising me or??  The old times 
were usually just short of 10 minutes.
