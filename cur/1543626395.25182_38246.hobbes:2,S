        Hi Linus,
	Do I need to say more ? A new batch of IrDA patches that have
been waiting on my web page and tested intensively with 2.5.7-SMP
(Marcelo will have to wait for his turn).
	This mostly include some race conditions in LAP and discovery,
correcting my previous IrNET fix and final fixing of the USB driver.
	Not included in this batch is the LSAP scheduler and my
partial rewrite of IrTTP, that will have to wait. Martin also promised
me a new version of the vlsi driver.
        Have fun...
        Jean
