No. Every new kernel changes the constraints so every new kernel you have
to reconfigure from scratch. That also makes it very hard to be sure you got
the results right.
oldconfig has a simple algorithm that works well for current cases
Start at the top of the symbols in file order. If a symbol is new ask the
user. If a symbol is now violating a constraint it gets set according to 
existing constraints if not it gets set to its old value.
