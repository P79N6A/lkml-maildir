why? Please be specific.

Have you looked at the output Peter's patch produces? It prints out 
precise symbols:
 dcache_lock: 3000 0 [618] [<ffffffff8033badd>] _atomic_dec_and_lock+0x39/0x58
which can easily be turned into line numbers using debuginfo packages or 
using gdb. (But normally one only needs the symbol name, and we 
certainly do not want to burden the kernel source with tracking 
__FILE__/__LINE__ metadata, if the same is already available via 
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO.)
anything else?

what do you mean, specifically?

i really need specifics. Currently i have the choice between your stuff:
   17 files changed, 1425 insertions(+), 80 deletions(-)
and Peter's patch:
    6 files changed,  266 insertions(+), 18 deletions(-)
and Peter's patch (if it works out fine in testing - and it seemed fine 
so far on my testbox), is smaller, more maintainable, better integrated 
and thus the clear candidate for merging into -rt and merging upstream 
as well. It's far cleaner than i hoped this whole lock-stats thing could 
be done based on lockdep, so i'm pretty happy with Peter's current patch 
already.
