I don't consider the memory allocation that [new] and constructor/destructor
operations perform to be "hidden".  In fact, anyone who thinks that [new]
doesn't allocate memory is a moron.  [new] is nothing more than a malloc
followed by an indirect function call with a single pointer parameter passed.
There's nothing hidden or secret about that.
However, I do agree that for many kernel operations, C++ doesn't help any.
However, that doesn't mean that people writing device drivers should be
excluded from using C++.  Having known C++ keywords in header files, and
refusing to change them because you don't want other people using C++, is
selfish and narrow-minded and not something that a Linux programmer should be
proud of.
