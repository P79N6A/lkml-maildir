This forces to overflows in fixed sized memory mapped buffer.
If we remove memory mapped buffer or will allow to have overflows (and
thus skipped entries) keven can easily scale to that limits (tested with
xx.xxx events though).

And what happens when there are 3 empty at the beginning and \we need to
put there 4 ready events?

The problem is in that xxx pages - how many can we eat per kevent
descriptor? It is pinned memory and thus it is possible to have a DoS.
If xxx above is not enough to store all events, we will have
yet-another-broken behaviour like rt-signal queue overflow.
