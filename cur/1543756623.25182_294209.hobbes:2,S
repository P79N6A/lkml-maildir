Why should I pass the first thing of size X as scatterlist, and the
second thing of size X as linear buffer? 
I could do that. It would be reasonable, because tweaks are more likely
to be generated than transmitted, read or whatever. But what for shall I
narrow the interface? I could also pass a linear mapped buffer as
scatterlist. This doesn't cause any overhead.
And switching to a more specific interface would just delay a solution
of the inherent limitations of kmap's. I guess it will take another half
year until the next guy stumbles across this (totally undocumented!)
problem. Why are you pushing to ignore this problem?
