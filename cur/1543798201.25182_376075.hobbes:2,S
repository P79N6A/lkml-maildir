The EFI page size is smaller than the Linux page size, but firmware
typically coalesces adjacent ranges with the same attributes.

We could, but I don't think it's worth it at this point.  We've
been using the same simple-minded scheme for validating /dev/mem
read & write requests for quite a while with no problems, and I
don't want to over-engineer this.
If hot-plug memory is ever finished, the checker may have to
be extended to comprehend regions described by ACPI as well as
those described in the boot-time EFI memory map.  I think that
would be the right time to make it smarter about spanning
descriptors.
