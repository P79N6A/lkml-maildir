   I have one concerns surrounding the three drivers mentioned above.
   Currently, they blindly use uart_get_baud_rate() without limiting the
   maximum baud rate.  Since the baud rate will be limited (by the
   hardware), we must limit the resulting baud rate must be reflected
   back into the termios c_cflag member.
Hmmm, maybe it's a better idea to store the min/max in the UART port
structure and have the upper layer do the limiting before we call
down into the driver?
