Subject: [2.3.41] Possible memory corruption

Under 2.3.41, 2 hours ago, I wasn't able to load netscape up in X-Windows. I
gdb'd the core file and it reported a crash due to Illegal Instruction. I ran
netscape from under gdb and it booted up fine. Then 2 hours later, after
closing down netscape, a 'telnet' session that I had open for 11 hours from
the night prior just crashed with a segfault after a minute of typing.
I switched back to 2.3.40 just now to see if the problem persists, but I
haven't seen anything like this since some of the old 2.1 kernels. It doesn't
look to be swap related since I've always had 0 bytes used in swap space
throughout the problematic period.
Running Cyrix 6x86 120MHz, 96MB ram.
