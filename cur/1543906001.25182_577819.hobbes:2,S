Thanks for the patch!
Looks like it fixed the problem Matt was having...

The newly patched atl1 driver seems to be working fine.  I tried it
also in rt21.3 (that's the latest src.rpm in
http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/all/linux/SRPMS/
), and it
also worked fine -- I need kernel-rt-devel because I do use apps that
need nvidia drivers, and those are working fine in rt21.3 as well.  I
can keep you up to date if anything negative happens.
Thanks again,
Matt
