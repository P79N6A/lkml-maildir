Now you're talking my language... nope, they aren't used on any of my
machines... hmm...  Anyone want to lend me their Thinkpad? ;-P
On a related note, I found it kind of depressing when I went to RE a
Windows driver, I got millions of hits on how to crack copy protection
on games, and only one guide to RE for Linux driver development:
http://dxr3.sourceforge.net/re.html
I'd really like to create a HOWTO, as there are some tricky aspects
(like getting your IDA Pro symbols loaded into SoftICE), and it's much
easier to find the register write routines than the document indicates.
Just grep for "inb", "outb" and friends, most likely they each appear
exactly once.
Of course, with IO breakpoints, you don't even have to do that, but the
register read/write routines are a good place to work backwards from...
