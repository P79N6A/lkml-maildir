Yes, that ~works.  I couldn't starve root to death as a SCHED_SOFTRR user, 
but the system was very sluggish, with keystrokes taking uncomfortably 
long.  I also had some sound skips due to inheritance.  If I activate 
xmms's gl visualization under load, it inherits SCHED_SOFTRR, says "oink" 
in a very deep voice, and other xmms threads expire.  Maybe tasks shouldn't 
inherit SCHED_SOFTRR?
While testing, I spotted something pretty strange.  It's not specific to 
SCHED_SOFTRR, SCHED_RR causes it too.  If I fire up xmms's gl visualization 
with either policy, X stops getting enough sleep credit to stay at a usable 
priority even when cpu usage is low.  Fully repeatable weirdness.  See 
attached top snapshots.
