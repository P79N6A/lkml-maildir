The snippet you posted doesn't describe what ClusterThingy exactly wants
to do with ARPs. 
Arpfilter was designed for multiple interfaces, to direct ARP replies
to specific interfaces based on the routing table. If you have only a 
single interface and no other way to policy route the packet I think you can 
only try to use policy routing hacks (not tested). e.g. tag all outgoing 
packets with a specific fwmark that redirects them to a specific routing
table which does the real routing, and put no routes into the normal 
one used by arpfilter so that it doesnt' reply.
Admittedly it's quite a hack. Perhaps Alexey can suggest a better solution,
he's the routing/arp guru. I guess it would be easier if arpfilter was
able to select a special own routing table, but I was too chicken to implement
that.
