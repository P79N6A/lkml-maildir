If you were suggesting this to be run on an SMP system, I would agree
with you.  I, too, would very much like to see these results run on a
2-CPU or 4-CPU system, although I am most certainly -not- asking Kristian
and Karim to do this work -- it is very much someone else's turn in the
barrel, I would say!
However, on a UP system, I have to agree with Kristian's choice of
configuration.  An embedded system developer running on a UP system would
naturally use a UP Linux kernel build, so it makes sense to benchmark
a UP kernel on a UP system.
						Thanx, Paul
