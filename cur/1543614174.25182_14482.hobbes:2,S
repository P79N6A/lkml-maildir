IMHO you have an overdeveloped faith in technology 8)
Things to check
1.	Does tcpdump show anything if you ping the box from another machine
2.	Is the link light on
3.	Does the irq count in /proc/interrupts for the card rise
	appropriately ?
4.	What does the 3c5x9 diagnostic tool say (
http://www.scyld.com
)
The reason I ask is that Linux 2.2 and on some platforms 2.4 will be relying
on BIOS IRQ routing where Windows 9x will do the work itself. So I've seen
precisely these symptoms before
