Only in so far as they provide a data transport.  With pipes/socketpairs
you have to have a destination to connect to.  Not so for Message Queues.
It provides a means of sending anonymous data out to a spool where anyone
may pull it at their convenience (ie: the received doesn't have to be
active when the sender is).  The typing attribute gives the programmer a
way of discrete message designation.  There are many uses for this.

Oh, please.  Not more of "It's the 'Net, Stupid".  That rates right up
there with people thinking the Web *is* the 'Net (which is balogne).  If
the facility had been intended to be distributed, it would have been
designed as such.

Now, here I happen to agree.  AIX implemented them as a convenient way of
waiting on FDs and msgqueues (which in AIX were distributed).  That being
said, I only recall one program actually using that feature (one I wrote).

As long as the interface doesn't change and it's at least as fast and
stable as the kernel version, it'd be OK with me.  But, that's shared
memory, not message queues ;-)
