Why don't you just pull the PCI and USB module information out of the
drivers themselves?  All the information you need it in the
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro.  You don't get a pretty vendor string for
most all of the USB devices that use a USB class spec, but that isn't
necessary.
All you are caring about is what device is supported by what module,
right?  That can be easily determined by the info in the modules.usbmap
and modules.pcimap files in the /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/
directory.
Keeping tables like these will be a tough thing to do, that's why the
linux-hotplug project relies on the drivers themselves to do the work.
