  Most likely that is what I did mean.
Things in IETF do on occasion change names, or I don't always
remember all characters in (E)TLA-acronyms I use rarely...

At least I didn't expect that, don't know of others.
It all depends on application coders, if users will be able
to use arbitrary network protocols -- say any SOCK_STREAM
protocol supported now, and in future by system kernel.
Ever heard of "TLI" ?

Yes, but sufficiently important to occasionally.
Doing things like this mapping might make limited sense
via routing table lookups.
