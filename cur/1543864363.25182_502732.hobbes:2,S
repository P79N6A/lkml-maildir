I was (am) quite unsure why this was, given that the patch did not touch 
x86_64 at all and moreover continued to apply cleanly to mm...
Did you just mean you also wanted the x86_64 version of it? In the next 
two messages I'll resubmit the i386 version, and submit the x86_64 version.
i386 has been compiled and tested, x86_64 has been crosscompiled only, 
due to lack of hardware. It's completely the same as the i386 version 
though...
Rene.
