Have think about your own tag line mate. C is pure. A kernel should be
as pure as possible. Leave it alone folks - haven't we all been down
this road before? Why does everyone want to move higher and higher up
the ladder when it comes to languages? Does no one still love to code in
pure ASM any more or am I just stuck in the past? Leave complexity for
application programmers. System programmers should dream in binary and
talk ASM. :-)

FWIW, userspace is moving away from C as unproductive and unsafe. KDE is
of course C++, mozilla, openoffice are C++, and gnome is moving towards 
(of all things) C#.
GCC considered adopting a C++ subset. My impressions of the discussion 
was that (a) a majority of the developers would like that (b) RMS would 
never allow it (c) there were concerns about bootstrap on platforms 
where a C++ compiler was not available.
Kernels of other operating systems (Windows, AIX (?)) allow C++. And 
don't start about Windows crashing whenever you sneeze at it - it's so
1998.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick
to panic.
