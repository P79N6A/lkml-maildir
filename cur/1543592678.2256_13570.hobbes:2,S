	"M-x describe-copying" just displays the file
/usr/share/emacs/<version>/etc/COPYING.   The emacs binaries do not
contain the text of GPL.
	By the way, if one wanted to #include the text of the GPL,
then, in the specific case of the GPL, one could argue that the
restrictions on modifying the GPL are part of the GPL and, therefore
not further restrictions.  (Even though those restrictions occur before
the "preamble", they're just as binding and removing them would be a
change to the GPL, so they are an existing restriction of the GPL rather
than a further restriction.)
	That said, I have long advocated that authors use
GPL-compatible copying conditions for everything, including plain text,
to facilitate free software effects on platforms that comingle code
and documentation, such as many web pages and some other interactive
media.
