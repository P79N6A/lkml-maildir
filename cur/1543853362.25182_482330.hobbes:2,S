It was very carefully code reviewed at least the first time,
and the code was put in sync with code that was tested.
But things happens so the lack of testing was noted.

PGE is never required.  Especially on a temporary page table.
PGE is an optimization, to make context switches faster.

Read the code.  Given your scorn and the state of that mess when I
started I'm not certain a productive conversation can be had.
Do you understand the code as it is currently written?
