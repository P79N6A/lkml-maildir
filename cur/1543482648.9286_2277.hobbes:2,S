I encounter some of the similar problems. With the same card, running
the 2.2.0 kernel, I use tar to backup alot of files from nfs mounted
disks to a SCSI mounted DAT. The disks belong to various OS's.
However, I do not experience any rebooting, all systems remain normal,
except my own. After some time (seems to vary, perhaps around 40
minutes), my network dies. I can't reach anything. If I restart the
network interface configuration (on Red Hat 5.1:
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart) and ypbind, everything is back to
normal, and tar continues as if nothing happened.
I ran this backup procedure twice today (it takes about 4 hours), and
the same thing happend. The second time, I used cron to run a script
every minute, that checks if the network is down, if it is, restart
network interface configuration and ypbind. Allthough ugly, the backup
procedure finished succesfully, with about 4-8 network "downs".
From a previous post, it seems that this may be caused by the SMC card 
itself. Anyone with more information on this?
Kind regards,
~ Hav.
