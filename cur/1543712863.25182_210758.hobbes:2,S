Hello,
I did try to find an answer is SuSE's support database, not in SAP's support 
database, and also did search Google, but could not find an answer:
We run SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 8 (SLES8) on a HP rx4640 Itanium2 server 
with 2 CPUs (family: Itanium 2, model: 1, revision: 5, archrev: 0).
In syslog is do see periodic kernel messages (with no implicit priority) that 
read:
dw.sapC11_DVS02(14393): floating-point assist fault at ip 400000000062ada1, 
isr 0000020000000008
("dw.sapC11_DVS02" is a SAP R/3 work process (46D_EXT, patch 1754, for those 
who care)
Can anybody explain what this message means? Is it an application problem, or 
is it a kernel problem?
Regards,
Ulrich
