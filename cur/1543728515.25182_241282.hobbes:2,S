I think you're thinking of the scripts engine?  on pre 53c875 chips,
yes, this is true.  The on-board processor is executing instructions
from host memory.  However, this is read only in quiescent (waiting for
host connect or target reconnect) mode, so shouldn't be a problem for
suspend.  On the 875 and later, we host the scripts in on-chip memory so
they shouldn't be troubling main memory when idling.

Why?  We don't do a bus reset on boot, why should we need to do one on
resume?  For FC, the equivalent, a LIP Reset can be rather nasty on a
SAN and should be avoided.
The slight problem is probably going to be knowing that we may need to
spin up devices (for internal ones) before resuming operation.
