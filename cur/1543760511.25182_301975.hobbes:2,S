Hi all,
I tried to disable fastpath code in tcp_rcv_established() (i suppose i need this for some debugging purposes)
by commenting out corresponding lines 4110-4252 in net/ipv4/tcp_input.c (kernel ver 2.4.28)
after recompiling kernel doesn't want to transmit tcp packets properly and even segmenatation faults from time to time...
where am i wrong?
thanks,
Serge Goodenko,
