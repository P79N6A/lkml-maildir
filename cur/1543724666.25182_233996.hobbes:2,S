it's not just about the stack! It's a "is the value of the PROT_EXEC bit
just an embelishment of /proc output or is it taken seriously" thing. My
change enforces the X bit for _all_ applications and gives the X bit to
almost all mappings created by legacy applications:

this way you get what you see. An X mapping is executable, a !X one isnt.  
No magic "this applications' mappings means this, that application's
mappings mean that". This also streamlines the kernel side of any NX
solution added to an arch where applications had executability
expectations: you can just add the capability because the mappings done
lie anymore and compatibility is done by following that old expectation
for old binaries. No hackery with personalities, split decisions in the
pte handling paths, etc.
So as you can see in the above maps file, the change impacts the default
mappings for the stack, heap and mmap()s. The only narrow exeception is
that if legacy userspace asks for !PROT_EXEC via mprotect() explicitly and
then expects executability _that_ will be denied (fortunately we havent
met such a case yet) - but all the other cases will result in executable
mappings, to preserve compatibility. E.g. there are only two
non-executable mappings in the above layout, both were created by glibc
via mprotect() and are fully expected to be non-executable.
the process stack's executability itself is controlled via the value of
PT_GNU_STACK - either X or !X. (subsequently any newly loaded shared
library might also change the process' stack. So if you link against an
older library without PT_GNU_STACK then the presumption will be the
compatible one: to have an executable stack. This is not an issue in new
distros, but might help with using third party libraries.)
all of this is needed to have a smooth sailing into the NX world.
