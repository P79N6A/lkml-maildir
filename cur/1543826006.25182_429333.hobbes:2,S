That's contrary to common use (outside of the kernel). I'm opposed to this. Detecting an initial bad EIP isn't a
problem, and the old code can be used easily in that case.

RIP/EIP corruption, as said above, can be easily handled. RSP/ESP corruption, as I understand it, isn't being handled
in the old code, and so I can't see what improvements the new code could do here (given that instruction and stack
pointers serve as the anchors for kicking off an unwind).

Again, you miss the point that the very last unwind operation must always be expected to move the stack pointer outside
the stack boundaries, which would mean triggering the fallback path in all cases. With this, we could as well leave out
the entire unwind code and keep everyone of us manually do the separation of good and bad entries in the trace shown.
