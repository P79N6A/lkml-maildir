The same thing here (I reported this a while ago in another context, but nooen
seemed to notice). My combination of things is a UP Pentium/II with SMP
2.3.99-preX and 2.4.0-testX kernels, a (crappy) Nvidia Riva128 running with
XF86-3.3.6. The obvious similarities are:
- recent kernels,
- lockups "related to" DPMS (at work, I have a system with a Voodoo3
  (sometimes a  G400) that doesn't lock up -- X doesn't try to DPMS the
  monitor AFAIK)
- SVGA X-Server (G400, Voodoo3, Riva128)
So I guess we can blame it on the combination recent kernel/XF86_SVGA/DPMS.
Too find out the real culprit is a totally different story, though.
