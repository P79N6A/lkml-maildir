Right, nikita once talked me though all that when we talked about
clustered writeout.
IIRC filesystems were supposed to keep mempools big enough to do this
for a single writepage at a time. Not sure its actually done though.
One advantage here is that swap writeout is very simple, so for
swap_writepage() the overhead is minimal, and we can free up space to
make progress with the fs writeout. And if there is little anonymous in
the system it must have a lot clean because of the dirty limit.
But yeah, there are some nasty details left here.

My idea is to extend kswapd, run cpus_per_node instances of kswapd per
node for each of GFP_KERNEL, GFP_NOFS, GFP_NOIO. (basically 3 kswapds
per cpu)
whenever we would hit direct reclaim, add ourselves to a special
waitqueue corresponding to the type of GFP and kick all the
corresponding kswapds.
Now Linus' big objection is that all these processes would hit a wall
and not progress until the watermarks are high again.
Here is were the 'special' part of the waitqueue comes into order.
Instead of freeing pages to the page allocator, these kswapds would hand
out pages to the waiting processes in a round robin fashion. Only if
there are no more waiting processes left, would the page go to the buddy
system.

Yeah, just need to look at the locking an batching, and ensure it has
enough preload to survive one batch, once all the locks are dropped it
can breathe again :-)

Ah, interesting notion.

One could get quite far, however the scenario of shutting down the
remote swap server while other network traffic is present will surely
still deadlock.

Right, I was speaking of a kernel with my patches applied. Sorry for the
confusion.
