Seems like a good plan - the abstraction will make it easier to change the
underlying mechanism. I'm not desperately keen on the new naming, but
given the current code state it makes sense, I guess. Once Andy has got
sparsemem merged up, and we change struct pgdat to be called struct node
or something more sensible, we can revisit it then.
