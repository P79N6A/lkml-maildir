The system was otherwise completely idle.  The only active task was  
starting the X server.
The failure is 100% reproducible on my test system.
We have not run a lot of different kernels per se.  We ran 2.6.9, and  
it was fine.  When we ran RHEL 5, it came with 2.6.18.  All we really  
did was rebuild 2.6.18 with that chunk of code removed, and the  
problem went away.  Mind you, when that chunk of code was removed,  
there were a ton of errors about multiply freed audit blocks.  But at  
least the X server EDID transfer was successful.
As far as enabling/disabling the audit functionality:  I'm clueless  
about it. I think RHEL turned it on by default, but I don't know how  
to turn it on or off myself.
I will also note that the small stand-alone utility read_edid never  
failed.  It was only when vm86 was called from inside of the X  
server.  So perhaps there's a race condition with memory not being  
where it's expected to be when a large app calls out to real mode?
