Competition has its own benefits.

Supposing both device-mapper and (the kernel part of) EVMS get into the tree, 
there's nothing stopping you from submitting a patch to make EVMS use 
device-mapper.  If there's already equivalent code in EVMS, that just makes 
the job easier.
I'm firmly in the 'we need both' camp.
EVMS is a full-bloated^W blown enterprise solution, ready to go with every
imaginable bell and whistle.  Device-mapper represents the classic Linux 
minimalist approach.  Hopefully, with the two side-by-side in the tree, both 
will evolve more rapidly.
