You'd have to add special treatment to quite a number of programs (all
the different *getty programs, for example), for what benefit? A
slightly cleaner /dev?

While we in theory could have hotplug events for pty creation, this is
not a working approach, since it tries to work from the wrong side.
A pty is created when ptmx is opened (by libc). You need to pass a
tty/pty device node to syslog/getty/whatever, and not ptmx.
The daemon would be in the same situation the kernel is now - it would
have to divine when an application will be trying to open a non-existent
device node and create it juste before that.

No. You don't need all that for a user space console. Xterm works today.
Just specify in a config file for the userspace console which pty VT's
should it create and which programs to pass them to.

True. It's a tradeoff.
