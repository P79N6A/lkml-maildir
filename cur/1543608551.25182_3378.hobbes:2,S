Yeah, that's mostly wrong.

This can be minimized.  What the original poster asked for is a one-application
jail.  So, you boot up a filesystem that runs only that app, perhaps even
as the init process.  No system daemons, nothing but the app and whatever it 
runs.

Nope.  Duplicate block caching can be eliminated by making the root filesystem
a COW device (
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/shared_fs.html
) and 
mounting it sychronously.  COWing it will allow it to be shared among all VMs, 
with any changes being stored in the private COW file.  Mounting it synchronous
will disable caching in the VM.  So, for a number of virtual machines, there
will be, in total, slightly more than one copy of their data in the host's
memory.
Another possibility is hostfs.  You can directly mount a host directory
inside UML.  That can obviously be shared between UMLs, so you again 
eliminate all the duplication.

This is a problem for a COWed block device, but it's trivial for a shared
hostfs directory.  Just dump the new bits in.
