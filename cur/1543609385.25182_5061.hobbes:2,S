Guys,
drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c deadlocks immediately on SMP, because
io_request_lock is not held over its call to scsi_old_done().
I don't know why scsi_old_done() actually requires io_request_lock;
perhaps Jens could comment on whether I've taken the lock in the
appropriate place?
With the appended patch I can confirm that the driver happily runs
`dbench 40' for half an hour on dual x86.   Even when you kick the
disk onto the floor (sorry, HJ).
The games which scsi_old_done() plays with spinlocks and interrupt
enabling are really foul.  If someone calls it with interrupts disabled
(sbp2 does this) then scsi_old_done() will enable interrupts for you.
If, for example, you call scsi_old_done() under spin_lock_irqsave(), 
the reenabling of interrupts will expose you to deadlocks.  Perhaps
scsi_old_done() should just use spin_unlock()/spin_lock()?
I tried enabling SBP2_USE_REAL_SPINLOCKS in sbp2.c and that appears to
work just fine, although I haven't left that change in place here.
You don't actually _need_ SMP hardware to test SMP code, BTW.  You
can just build an SMP kernel and run that on a uniprocessor box.
This will still catch a wide range of bugs - it certainly detects
the lockup which was occurring because of the scsi_old_done() thing.
Incidentally, it would be nice to be able to get this driver working
properly when linked into the kernel - it makes debugging much easier :)
