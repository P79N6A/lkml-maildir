Makes sense because the crash may (in your case does) happen later 
in the switching sequence at which time the "new" log already made 
it to disk - I'll use your variant from now on ;)
The qestion now is whether this is kernel or X related.
Have you had this problem with an earlier 2.6 or 2.4 kernel?
If it is specific to -test5, post (as tar.bz2)
- lspci -v  
- /var/log/dmesg
- X version and driver info from /var/log/XFree86.log 
- .config
Regards
Michael
