Which reminds me: Too bad the kernel says "Busy" without really
thinking aboutit. 
Assume that I have a 
	<hda1> swap 1G    (*)
	<hda2> root 19G   (active)
        <free space> 
disk, and want to add an extra partition. Maybe I have a 20G image
which I want to copy onto 20, 40, 60, 80, 120 and 200Gb disks. I can
then add the third partition as a /data or a /tmp partition. However
as the active root is on that disk I have to reboot. But in fact I
don't intend to change the active partition. 
So, there should be objections if I want the new partitioning scheme
to be: 
	<hda1> swap 1.5G 
	<hda2> root 19G   (active)
        <free space> 
then there is a problem and I can understand "Busy".  But if the new
scheme is: 
	<hda1> swap 1G  
	<hda2> root 19G   (active)
        <hda3> data 20G   <unformatted>
then I don't understand the reason for refusing the rereadpt request.
Anybody want to code this up?
	Roger. 
(*) usually active as well, but easily deactivated. So lets pretend
it's inactive for this discussion.
