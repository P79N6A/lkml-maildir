Adam (and the rest of the parallel crowd),
Just a passing thought (and nothing more)...
How does this behave with PCMCIA initialisation with a Cardbus card
inserted?
This is one scenario which needs checking before any of this parallel
probe code goes anywhere near mainline, since it's possible for the
Cardbus (PCI) device to be added and therefore probed while the Yenta
probe (PCI) is still running.
