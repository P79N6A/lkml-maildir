I did your correction and I got a kernel panic(attempting to kill init)
on boot. It didn't flushed to disk, so it isn't attached, but it panics
at effective_prio+0xcc/0xe0.
With objdump I could see it traps a division by 0: 
cc:       f7 fb                   idiv   %ebx
I remember cleary %ebx being 0 on the panic report.
And I tracked down and the code is on this else in effective_prio:
----------- sched.c 341-----------------
else {
	sleep_period = (sleep_period *
		17 * sleep_period / ((17 * sleep_period / (5 * tau + 2)) * 5 * tau));
	if (!sleep_period)
		return p->static_prio;
	}
--------------------------------------
I don't have the time now to track this further today, but what happens
if sleep_period is too small and tau is too big?
 Could this (17 * sleep_period / (5 * tau + 2) give 0 and so a division
by 0?
