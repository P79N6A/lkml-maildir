Hello!
I have exactly the same problem with this harddrive and the kernel of 
SUSE 8.0 (2.4.18 with their patches). When I apply the patch of JunHyeok 
Heo the harddrive is detected an I can install SuSE. When this patch is 
not the correct solution, what else to do?
Thank you for your  help.
Joachim
