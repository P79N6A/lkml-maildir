Why not just have the filesystem create a parallel directory structure for
streams at the mount point. e.g.   /mnt/fs and /mnt/streamfs .  This way
namespace is preserved and existing tools will still work. The streamsfs
will contains a similar directory structure as the original but instead of
files, will contain all streams.  If there was a file /mnt/fs/WinNT/file
there could also be a stream /mnt/streamfs/WinNT/file.
