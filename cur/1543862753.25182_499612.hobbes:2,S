I agree that it is a worthy objective to be able to constrain a cpuset's
dirty memory levels.  But as a performance optimisation and NOT as a
correctness fix.
Consider: non-exclusive cpuset A consists of mems 0-15, non-exclusive
cpuset B consists of mems 0-3.  A task running in cpuset A can freely dirty
all of cpuset B's memory.  A task running in cpuset B gets oomkilled.
Consider: a 32-node machine has nodes 0-3 full of dirty memory.  I create a
cpuset containing nodes 0-2 and start using it.  I get oomkilled.
There may be other scenarios.
IOW, we have a correctness problem, and we have a probable,
not-yet-demonstrated-and-quantified performance problem.  Fixing the latter
(in the proposed fashion) will *not* fix the former.
So what I suggest we do is to fix the NFS bug, then move on to considering
the performance problems.
On reflection, I agree that your proposed changes are sensible-looking for
addressing the probable, not-yet-demonstrated-and-quantified performance
problem.  The per-inode (should be per-address_space, maybe it is?) node
map is unfortunate.  Need to think about that a bit more.  For a start, it
should be dynamically allocated (from a new, purpose-created slab cache):
most in-core inodes don't have any dirty pages and don't need this
additional storage.
Also, I worry about the worst-case performance of that linear search across
the inodes.
But this is unrelated to the NFS bug ;)
