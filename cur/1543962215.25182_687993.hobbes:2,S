But is it smarter to discourage people from doing code review, by saying
that they won't be doing it anyway,
or actively and publicly encourage people to do so, even on the chance
that it might not lead to everyone doing it?
It's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy that way.
Trying to force it through the process is another matter entirely.
Cheers,
