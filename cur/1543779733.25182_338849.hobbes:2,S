Think about a threaded process that gets time on multiple processors 
and then compares the times. This means that the time value obtained later 
on one thread may indicate a time earlier than that obtained on another 
thread. An essential requirement for time values is that they are 
monotonically increasing. You are changing that basic nature.

I assure you it is not going to be trivial. IA64 asm instructions bundling 
and cycle optimization will have to be changed.
