I can only produce patches against the official kernels. To do
anything else is a maintenance nightmare. What is needed is someone
with the time and interest to produce patches against the current RAID
patch. Anyone willing to do that should contact me so we can
co-ordinate. I'm also willing to carry devfs patches for
official-kernel+raid patches on my ftp site, so there can be a
centralised repository. Or I can add a URL on my WWW page. Whatever.
