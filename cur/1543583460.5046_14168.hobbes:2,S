More importantly, the mainstream raw io code only writes in 64KB chunks
that are unpipelined, which can lead to writes not hitting the drive
before the sector passes under the rw head.  You can work around this to
some extent by issuing multiple writes (via threads, or the aio work I've
done) at the expense of atomicity.  Also, before we allow locking of
arbitrary larger ios in main memory, we need bean counting to prevent the
obvious DoSes.
