Subject: [PATCH] make sure init_mm is included
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

mm/sparse-vmemmap.c uses init_mm in some places. However, it
is not present in any of the headers currently included in the file.
init_mm is defined as extern in sched.h, so we add it to the headers list
Up to now, this problem was masked by the fact that functions like
set_pte_at() and pmd_populate_kernel() are usually macros that expand
to simpler variants that does not use the first parameter at all.
