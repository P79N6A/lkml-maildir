I wouldn't call it any fast when I think about the idea that 31 of my CPUs 
on Hawkeye shall be stopped because I unload a module. Sometimes at high 
noon my server (Hawkeye) can hardly keep up all the traffic. Just imagine 
a module would be unloaded then! That's the problem I'm having with it.
What should make a lock for parts of the kernel slower than a lock for 
the _whole_ kernel?
