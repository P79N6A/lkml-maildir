Oddly enough, that's really what we are trying to acheive.  There is
definitely some tension between the VMI model which is modeled very
directly on hardware and something like the Xen model which prefers
higher level interfaces.
I don't really agree with your metrics w.r.t hooks.  My point is you
take callsites == hooks to arrive at 1463 hook, but then above say 100
hooks is sufficient.  But we have on the order of 100 hooks (I believe
it's ~75 in Linus' tree).  Put it another way.  Do you believe that
something like irq_{en,dis}able() is appropriate to hook (as that's >
1400 callsites already)?

It would be imminently helpful if you helped with some specific ideas
on where the paravirt_ops interface needs to be adjusted.

How would you propose doing that?  Typically that's done with code
review and patches.
