OK, it's a proposal rather than a statement.  Apologies in that case.
Let me be clear that I am unwilling to support changes to the DRM that break 
it's usability on other operating systems on principle.
Maybe it's time to consider a fork of the DRM to allow a major experimentation 
of the form Jon envisages to proceed without worrying about boring constraints 
like keeping BSD working, backwards compatibility, etc.  And the current DRM 
architecture, which is pretty much stabilized, can continue to do those boring 
tasks, and accumulate new drivers, until GNULonghorn is finished...
