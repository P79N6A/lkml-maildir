Ok, thanks.... might you also merge a good fix (either your complete, and 
possibly compilation one, or the one I sent you) about sys/ptrace.h? I've 
seen the complete patch into your tree, however it is not that easy to apply 
- and might maybe (I dunno) give some problems to users with strange 
configurations.
