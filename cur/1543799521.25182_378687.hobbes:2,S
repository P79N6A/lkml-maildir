BTW, I strongly believe the semaphore implementation could go with the 
same model the mutex model I hope is heading for.
I.e., the only thing each architecture really have to implement is 
__sem_fast_down and __sem_fast _up, and incidentally they would have the 
exact same definition as your atomic_*_call_if_* functions (while a bit 
too restrictive for mutex semantics, they really are the minimum 
required for semaphores).  Then all the current per architecture 
semaphore code could be consolidated.
