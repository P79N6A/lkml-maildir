Since upgrading to version 2.2.x of the kernel I have noticed the
messages "can't locate module ppp-compress-21,26 and 24" in the system
logs whenever I start up my ppp link with my ISP. I assume that I am
missing some alias statements in conf.modules. Could someone please tell
me what these should be aliased to. I am using a 56K modem for my PPP
link if that makes any difference.
Thank you,
Marc Glade
P.S. Please respond to me directly as this is most likely off topic.
