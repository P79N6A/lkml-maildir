Hi Manfred,
I'm running your patches [1] with sucess for a while now.
Did you get any feedback about problems regarding these patches?
They seem to work for me, but there seems to be a memleak in
2.4.x (x: 0-2), which I'm chasing down.
The problem is, it only shows up after about 3-4 days of uptime.
So there is no quick test and I'm even not sure about the
kernel version where this exactly occurs, because I run sometimes
2.4.0 for working and sometimes the latest one, to see whether
the problem still persists.
Regards
Ingo Oeser
