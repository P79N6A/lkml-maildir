I found your oneliner very useful, but still have to say that the most
tedious part is not modifying files, but writing down all reported
inode numbers (from fsck pass). If you have lots of disk space, fsck
can take some time, and you're spending that time watching the screen,
writing inode numers in a hurry, so you can check later if any major
corruption happened.
When in fact, fsck should tell you to go and get some coffee in a
local pub, if it starts running on any FS bigger than GB or two. :)
