Not really.  The arch/ppc/boot version (and arch/mips/boot'ish too, when
it gets merged) are slightly different from the in-kernel ones by ~1
line, so that they allow things to be decompressed to 0x0.  My plan for
2.5 is to get the PPC version using the lib/zlib_deflate stuff (by dummy
files doing #include too), maybe.  But either way it's a non-issue (if
you can't trust the 'zImage' binary, you've got bigger problems than
someone trying to expliot a bug before Linux is running).
