Also, pkts could be dropped even for TCP sockets.  TCP will cause the pkt to
be retransmitted, but while that is occuring, the read that was prompted by
the select will still block.
So, any app that does not use O_NONBLOCK is broken, if they assume that a
successful select will indicate a nonblocking read/recvmsg.
