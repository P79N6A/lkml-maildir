Linux is utterly riddled with broken APIs. It's possible to see that as 
a downside of the "Release early, release often" model, but the 
advantage is that we get the opportunity to determine how these 
interfaces are broken. Based on that, we can either improve the existing 
interface or decide that it's broken beyond repair and design a new one.
What we don't do is decide that an interface is broken, deprecate it 
and in the same release break it even for the cases where it 
previously worked. That's just insane.

I could, and in the long run I intend to. On the other hand, I don't 
expect to have enough time to fix every single in-tree network driver 
before 2.6.20, so...

How about something like this? Entirely untested, but I think it shows 
the basic idea.
