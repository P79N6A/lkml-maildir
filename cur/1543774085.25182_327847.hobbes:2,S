Well that's quite a problem.  We're certainly causing people such as
yourself to take on quite a lot of work.  But on the other hand we do want
the kernel to progress sanely, and that sometimes involves taking things
out.
I don't have enough info to know whether the world would be a better place
if we keep devfs, remove devfs or remove devfs even later on.  I don't
think anyone knows, which is why we're taking this little
disable-it-and-see-who-shouts approach.
