Subject: What happened to lookup_dentry?

I'm porting a driver from 2.2 to 2.4, and this driver calls lookup_dentry,
which doesn't exist in 2.4.  I've read through the source code and searched the
web and newsgroups, and I can't find any explanation as to why lookup_dentry no
longer exists or how I'm supposed to change code that uses it.  Can anyone help
me?
