I recently jumped from linux-2.2.9-27mdk to 2.3.29 and later 2.3.30 but I have
never been able to connect to the Internet since the upgrade.  Do I need a new
pppd, and if so, which version and how do I install it and where do I get it
from?
Also, when I boot up my scanner is detected and identified correctly followed
by the designation "unsupported/untested."  What programs or utilities do I
need to use to scan with 2.3.30 so that I can test my scanner and maybe even
help develope support for it.
