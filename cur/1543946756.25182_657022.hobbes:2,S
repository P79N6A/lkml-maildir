Not really. But you have some things confused. What it checks is if the mmc bus handler (not a proper driver model, just a way of separating the MMC, SD and SDIO stuff) has a resume function. And if it doesn't, it removes the card (since it cannot revive it at resume).
So the only thing I can think of is to delay the removal until the resume routine, if that is safer.
