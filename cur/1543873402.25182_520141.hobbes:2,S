Subject: [PATCH] fix cyclades.h for x86_64 (and probably others)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
at least on x86_64 the present cyclades.h is broken due to the wrong size
of uclong. This affects, of course, both the kernel and the user-level
utilities. The symptom is that cyzload refuses to load the firmware.
I also managed to freeze the machine when unloading the module.
The patch below fixes this in an architecture-independent way.
I have tested it with 2.6.19 and the driver works fine again with a
Cyclades-Z on an Athlon 64 X2.
Please CC to me personally, as I am not subscribed to the list.
Thanks, Klaus
