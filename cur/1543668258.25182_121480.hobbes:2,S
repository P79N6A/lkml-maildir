Nothing can help you if you're getting input at the rate you
can write it.  You need ability to write at least somewhat faster
no matter how buffering is done.

If you need to sync more often than once per minute, consider
this shellscript:
for ((;;)) ; do sleep 1 ; sync ; done

_Every_ time you write a file in chunks not perfectly aligned
on block boundaries.

Only if that 30-second wait makes linux buffer more than it can handle.
That may indeed be a problem, but buffering up _some_ data
before writing is still a good idea.
