Bzzt.
SURE we do.
We absolutely do want to drop dirty data in the writeout path.
How do you think dirty data ever _becomes_ clean data?
In other words, yes, we _do_ want to test-and-clear all the pgtable bits 
_and_ the PG_dirty bit. We want to do it for:
 - writeout
 - truncate
 - possibly a "drop" event (which could be a case for a journal entry that 
   becomes stale due to being replaced or something - kind of "truncate" 
   on metadata)
because both of those events _literally_ turn dirty state into clean 
state.
In no other circumstance do we ever want to clear a dirty bit, as far as I 
can tell.
