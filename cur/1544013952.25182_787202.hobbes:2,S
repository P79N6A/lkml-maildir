On m68k, you get

So gcc (version 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21) in my case) is
smart and turns the strncat into a strlen() (without obeying our override of
strlen() in <{linux,asm}/string.h>) followed by an _unconditional_ store.
And I think that's the real bug: `strncat(buf, "\n", DM_NAME_LEN);' copies at
most DM_NAME_LEN characters from source "\n", which has the known size 2,
which is always smaller than DM_NAME_LEN. Hence the check is optimized away,
and the "\n" is _always_ appended!
Probably the intention was to limit the string in _buf_ (not the source string
"\n") to DM_NAME_LEN? If yes, this may cause a buffer overflow.
The same bug is present in dm_attr_uuid_show().
Fixing it will probably get rid of the undefined reference, too (I hope :-)
