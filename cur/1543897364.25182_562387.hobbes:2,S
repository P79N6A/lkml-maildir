Sorry for the hassle, but this patch should come first and then your
current first patch becomes much simpler and does not touch proto.h
needlessly.
Also, I still think an iommu_ops is a better approach. I'll put
something together when I add the Calgary shutdown bits next week
after OLS.
Cheers,
Muli
