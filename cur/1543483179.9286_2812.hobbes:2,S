Yes, this is an SMP kernel. But I've had problems with UP as well.

I don't think I've ever had reliable backups out of ide-tape. The closest
I came was with IDE-SCSI + SCSI tape. 
I'll try and eliminate SMP by compiling a UP version of the latest kernel,
and seeing if it replicates with that.
The latest I/O error:
ide-tape: ht0: DSC timeout
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
ide-tape: Block location is unknown to the tape
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  1, key =  2, asc =  4, ascq =  1
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  a, key =  2, asc =  4, ascq =  1
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  a, key =  2, asc =  4, ascq =  1
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  a, key =  2, asc =  4, ascq =  1
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  a, key =  2, asc =  4, ascq =  1
BTW, can the driver tell if the cartridge has write protect enabled? I
seem to recall trying to overwrite a write-protected tape once, and I got
one of the pc = X, key = Y, ... I/O errors. Not particularly
user-friendly, if that's the case.
