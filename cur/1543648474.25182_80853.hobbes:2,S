hello people,
I came across a rather annoying problem in the VIA82C686 southbridge audio driver. It will work ok, and then out of warning, go insane and completly lock the system up. It does seem to be rather random, theres no sound breakups or abnormalness, as if it was working perfectly.

Its happened about 3 times since i started using this board, only while the sound is in use of course. Actually to be more precise, when it becomes idle after use, or sudden use. Any ideas?
