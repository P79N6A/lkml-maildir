Q5. What is the chipset of the embedded (integrated) SCSI on the
    PL4500 and is there a Linux driver for it? 
A5. The chipset for the embedded SCSI controller on the PL4500 is the
    NCR53C825. The NCR53C8XX chipset in the PL4500 IS ON THE
    EISA BUS. Two drivers exist for the PCI version of this chipset:
    NCR53C8xx and SYM53c8xx; however, these drivers ONLY work with
    the PCI bus and WILL NOT WORK with the EISA bus. So the answer
    is: No, there is no Linux driver for the embedded SCSI controller
    on the PL4500.
