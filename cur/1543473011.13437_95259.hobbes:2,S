Yo!  We've extended the deadline.  Send papers.  
LinuxExpo is extending the call for papers.
The details are at
        
http://www.bitmover.com/linuxexpo
but the summary is that you have until January 14,
1999 to get us an abstract for a published paper;
and until March 1, 1999 to get us an abstract for
a talk without a paper.
Also, the restriction to groff only has long since
bitten the dust, only Rich Stevens and I know how
to tyoe in groff, apparently.  So we'll take LaTeX
with extra brownie points for groff submissions.
Thanks!
