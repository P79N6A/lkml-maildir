On 700MHz x86 running Cerberus we can do 50 microseconds average
and 1300 microseconds worst-case today.  
Below 1000 uSec, the required changes get exponentially larger
and more complex.  I doubt that it's sane to try to go below
a millisecond on a desktop-class machine with desktop-class
workload, disk, memory and swap capacities.
On a more constrained system, which is what I expect you're
referring to, 250 microseconds should be achievable.  Whether
or not that is achieved via preemptability is pretty irrelevant.
