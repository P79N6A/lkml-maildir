Which chinese version of Linux uses chinese device names? AFAIK most
(all?) distributions use the "standard" names, which is basically the same
as if it had been kernel policy anyway. Change device names at your own
peril -- many programs are hardcoded to fixed device names. (The kernel,
and init come to mind).
