[1.] kernel freezes without message when extracting ATAPI CD audio into FAT32
and consuming CPU
[2.] While extracting audio data from a CD into a FAT32 partition using
cdda2wav which is included in cdrecord 1.8a19 from
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/alpha/,
 and running bladeenc (an MP3
encoder) at the same time upon different files in the same partition, the
kernel appears to freeze.
  The X windows mouse stops responding to mouse events, the windows of
running programs stop updating, console-switching keys fail to work (C-A-F1),
the three-finger salute has no effect.  The only way out is to press the
reset button or power-cycle.  
 The FAT32 partition lives on /dev/hda5.  The ATAPI CDROM is /dev/hdc . 
After reboot you have to go to Win95 and repair the FAT32 partition (The file
that cdda2wav was recording has to be truncated or deleted).  Failure to do
so will wedge Linux later on when it encounters to bogus file entry.
  It is possible that the problem is not this specific, but I haven't made
extensive experiments.
