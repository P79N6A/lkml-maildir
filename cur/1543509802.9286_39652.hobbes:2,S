With a recent stable kernel, XMMS runs well on UP, but not SMP.
With a 56k stream, it usually has two processes which consume only a
small percent of CPU on a UP kernel.  But with a SMP kernel, the two
processes take up to 20% each.
Is this cache thrashing?  Are there any patches to deal with this?
