The SIGALRM loop happens here as well, only thing I noticed it _seems_ to
 happen when one of the windows attempts a TCP connection to a site which
 [don't kill me, I have no knowledge of a TCP connection handshaking phase]
 isn't quite fast in responding and netstat -tn shows the state as SYN_SENT.
Other data comes in for other windows, Recv-Q's build up, but if that TCP
 connection stays in SYN_SENT there is nothing to do except kill -SEGV the
 Netscape PID. Kill -TERM can at times make all windows go away but the
 process stays there, so a further SEGV is needed to complete the job :(
