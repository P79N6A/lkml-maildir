hm... We have: 
#define AUDIT_FIRST_USER_MSG    1100    /* Userspace messages mostly uninteresting to kernel */
#define AUDIT_USER_AVC          1107    /* We filter this differently */
#define AUDIT_LAST_USER_MSG     1199
and CPP turns that into
 case 1100 ...1199:
 case 2100 ...2999:
and it does the same when the comments are stripped from the #defines.
So we were saved by the trailing space which cpp added to the expanded
macro.  I wonder why cpp did that, and to what extent one can rely cpp
doing that.
Oh well.  I guess we should apply the patch.
