Nice work. I'd really like to see support for relocatable kernels in
mainline (and kexec-tools!).
Eric, could you please list the advantages of your run-time relocation
code over my incomplete relocate-in-userspace prototype posted to
fastboot a few weeks ago?
One thing I know for sure is that your implementation supports bzImage
while my only supports relocation of vmlinux files. Are there any
other uses for relocatable bzImage except kdump?
Thanks!
