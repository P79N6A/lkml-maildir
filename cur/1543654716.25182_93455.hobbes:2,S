Perhaps it would be a better idea to have the syscall vectors for the old
module functions do something other than simply return as not implemented.
Something along the lines of "(foo) attempted to use old module interface"
instead of simply deleting the functions entirely.
Otherwise, there are going to be 10 million people asking why modules don't
work anymore.  There is exactly ZERO indication that things have changed.
(The changes to the keyboard and pc speaker "beep" will have people confused
 as well.)
