Nvidia is a smart company, otherwise they wouldn't be in
business today.  I'm sure they'll switch to the GPL only
once it will be in their advantage to do so and no sooner.
When would it be an advantage for them ?
The moment there is a GPL graphics library (at the right
system level, of course) that's so good Nvidia won't be
able to resist using that library could be such a moment.
A new project for Hell.Surfers ? ;)

Rik
