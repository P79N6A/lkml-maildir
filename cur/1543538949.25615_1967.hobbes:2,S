Why don't you take a few item from the 2.5 todo list and start 2.5 
already 'feature-freezed'?  Being the list of changes short and 
*known in advance*, it should be easy to port later 2.4.x stability 
fixes to the new 2.5. So 2.6 release can be quite close in time.
Short todo list:
- BKL changes + drivers update&test;
- long-term VM changes (the kind of stuff you don't think to include in 2.4);
- ReiserFS integration: to cut l-k traffic by half B-)
- you know better that me what else...
Do you think the above can be done in, say, 6 months after 2.4.0?
