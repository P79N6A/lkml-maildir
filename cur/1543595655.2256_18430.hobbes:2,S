Yes, noflushd works with 2.4.x. I'm running it on an ibook with 
debian-unstable.
And as a word of warning: while running noflushd, make sure you 'sync' a 
few times after an 'apt-get dist-upgrade' that upgrades damn near 
everything before doing something that crashes the kernel. This WILL eat 
your ext2fs for breakfast.
