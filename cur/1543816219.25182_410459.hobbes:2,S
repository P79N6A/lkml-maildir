select and default don't really mix very well, a default is only active if 
nothing else enables the symbol, but select already enables here AGP, so 
the AGP default isn't needed/used anymore.
It's somewhat related to the other default behaviour, without changing 
that I don't see a clean and simple way to change this right now.
The easiest solution is to simply remove the default and let GART_IOMMU 
select AGP too.
bye, Roman
The AGP default doesn't work well with other selects, so use a select for 
GART_IOMMU as well. Remove a redundant default for SWIOTLB as well.
