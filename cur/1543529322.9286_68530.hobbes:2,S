Hi Linus,
just tried 2.3.50 and again my Xircom Ethernet/Modem/ISDN cardbus combo 
is a no-go. This time the other way round: it fails to allocate resource
0 for the Ethernet part and succeeds in allocation the the resources for
the serial part. Here are the relevant kernel messages:
  kernel: Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11
  kernel:   options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
  kernel: Adding cardbus controller 0: Texas Instruments PCI1225
  kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0698, PCI irq0
  kernel: Socket status: 30000020
  kernel: Adding cardbus controller 1: Texas Instruments PCI1225 (#2)
  kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0698, PCI irq0
  kernel: Socket status: 30000006
  ...
  kernel: cs: socket 0 timed out during reset
  kernel: cs: IO port probe 0x0c00-0x0cff: excluding 0xcf8-0xcff
  kernel: cs: IO port probe 0x0800-0x08ff: clean.
  kernel: cs: IO port probe 0x0100-0x04ff: excluding 0x158-0x15f 0x4d0-0x4d7
  kernel: cs: IO port probe 0x0a00-0x0aff: clean.
  kernel: keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is definitely a weird one: if i have the card inserted at boot time,
the system locks up when gpm is started (or at least it looses its keyboard
and mouse, no way to check the lockup without either serial or networked
terminal)
  kernel: cs: cb_alloc(bus 2): vendor 0x115d, device 0x0003
  kernel: PCI: Enabling device 02:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
  kernel: PCI: Failed to allocate resource 0 for PCI device 115d:0103
  kernel: PCI: Enabling device 02:00.1 (0000 -> 0003)
Btw. it seems as if drivers/pci/pci.ids and include/linux/pci_ids.h are
out of sync: the former knows the vendor and device id of my card just fine
while the latter doesn't...
In an unreleated matter: i noticed that the IDE driver for the PIIX4 had
allocated the i/o areas 0x170-0x17f and 0x1f0-0x1f7 in 14 1-byte regions.
What's the idea behind this?
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
