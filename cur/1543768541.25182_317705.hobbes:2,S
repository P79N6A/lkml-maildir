Waking it up at fork or exec time might be doable, and having a busy CPU 
wake up other CPUs wouldn't add too much complexity, would it?

The latest patches seem to do tick skipping rather than wholesale 
ticklessness.  Admittedly, the latter is a more invasive change, but one 
that may end up being simpler in the long run.  But maybe George did a 
design like that in the past and rejected it?
