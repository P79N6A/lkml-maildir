 What you are talking about isn't the kernel or such, but plugins that
 could extend the filesystem. Plugins could store information about
 contents, encodings, formatting, filesystems, etc, as meta-info. If
 you have a plugin that would allow you to traverse files as disk
 images then it could read those meta-data. But before those plugins
 exist then there is no such standard for info stored as meta-data and
 the kernel wouldn't know anything about this to begin with.
