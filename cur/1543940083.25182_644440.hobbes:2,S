and after a session of bisection, the winner patch is:
  Subject: x86: unify PAE/non-PAE pgd_ctor
which is a tad unexpected, given the relatively harmless nature of the 
patch. (but then again, nothing is really harmless in PAE land.)
btw., this is not fair i think: your patch was apparently caught by the 
new debugging helper that tells about itself here:
> [   29.389872] debug: unmapping init memory c0b03000..c0b6f000
note the close proximity of c0b6f000 and ebx = c0b6fc08. [ I regularly 
come up with such nasty tricks and debugging helpers like that to catch 
bad patches off-guard. You have been warned! ;-) ]
