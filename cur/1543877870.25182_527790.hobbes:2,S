I think you misunderstood the suggestion.  The idea is that you leave
the patches basically as-is (modulo any small tweaks required by
reordering), but rather than one 90-patch series, you divide the
patches up into independent subsets.  Maybe something like
 - basic OMAP fixes for bugs in core support
 - Palm platform stuff
 - ...other platform stuff
 - new features
etc.  then it's easier for people to review the stuff they're
interested in, and it's easier for at least some of the subsets to get
applied (which reduces your backlog).
