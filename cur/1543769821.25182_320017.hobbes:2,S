there was more stabilization activity during the past couple of weeks -

went MIA. I've also applied Mingming's ext3 reservation latency 
reductions.
Changes:

 - x86_64 fixes - it builds & boots now (Joe King)
 - ext3 reservations latency reductions (Mingming Cao)
 - kstopmachine yield() fixes (Steven Rostedt)
