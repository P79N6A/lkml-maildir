Windows 2000 doesn't even get this right 100% of the time either:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q281672
(I've seen this bug corrupt data in real life -- it's not just
theoretical. The really unfortunate part is that Win2K also forces the
write cache on, even if you try to turn it off, due to another bug.)
AFAIK a fix for this is planned for Win2K Service Pack 3, and WinXP works
properly (in this regard anyway) out-of-the-box.
