Looking at e.g. the fuction declarations in fs/namespace.c shows very well
that there seams to be no 'preferred in the kernel source' for this
question.
I presonally prefer indenting the continuation of a line with TWO
additional tabs so it is good to distinguish from a normally indented
command block. E.g.:
static int function_with_long_name(int and_many_arguments,
		int not_fitting_in_a_signle_line_anymore)
{
	if (and_many_arguments > not_fitting_in_a_signle_line_anymore &&
			not_fitting_in_a_signle_line_anymore > 0)
		and_many_arguments += not_fitting_in_a_signle_line_anymore;
	else
		not_fitting_in_a_signle_line_anymore *=
				not_fitting_in_a_signle_line_anymore;
	return and_many_arguments ^ not_fitting_in_a_signle_line_anymore;
}
maybe this won't win a design contest but it is a simple and non-ambiguous
coding style and afaics does not conflict with the CodingStyle document.
