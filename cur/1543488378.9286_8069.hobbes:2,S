   I don't understand why you even want to poll. My approach was to clean
   up at safe-delete time: I just do a stat(2) to see if there is enough
   space left. If not, I start purging. And in your ~/.logout you can
   call the command to empty the wastebasket.
   If you want to get more fancy, set up a cron job or add something to
   the boot scripts to clean up.
Someone deletes a large number of files on the system.  Sometime later,
some other user starts unpacking a kernel tree, and needs space.  It
would be nice for a daemon to notice that free space was getting
critical, and for it to start really deleted files that were in the
"trashcan" in order to make space.   After all, when the user deleted
the files, they're effectively stating that they don't want them
anymore, and the undelete option is just as a saving throw.  If they
then logout for three months, if the space is needed for something more
worthy, there should be a way for that space to be reclaimed
automatically.
