Wouldn't this only break existing applications that do incorrect
things (passing invalid values) ?
If that's the case I'd say breaking them is OK and we should change to
follow the spec.
I don't like potential userspace breakage any more than the next guy,
but if the breakage only affects buggy applications then I think it's
more acceptable.
