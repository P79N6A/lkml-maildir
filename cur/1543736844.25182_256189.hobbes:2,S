In principle, yes. The problem is that integrating two
unrelated uses of the perfmon HW will require major
changes in perfctr's ppc32 driver. And the kernel would
also have to be patched to redirect all DEC accesses to
the emulation code.
I have more pressing API issues to resolve, so I won't
do anything about this broken HW workaround for now.
