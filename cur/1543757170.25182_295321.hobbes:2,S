This is true but it does provide the mechanism to fix such devices. It
also fails safe because a driver that fails to disable leaves the device
always enabled.
With the ability to mark the specific awkward cases as "enabled on boot"
we can remove some of the horrible special case issues like IDE
controllers using BARs of the northbridge.
