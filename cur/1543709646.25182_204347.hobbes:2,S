No, there is no such requirement. Glibc doesn't need to duplicate kernel
defs either.
Do you really want duplicated code (definitions etc)?

That's bad, for sure.

So the kernel headers are buggy (and should be fixed) and the glibc
headers contain unneeded code (and they should be fixed as well).

The C library alone obviously provide some functionality such as string.h
functions and such API should be defined in glibc headers.
However, a part of the glibc (or any libc) functionality is provided by
the kernel itself. It is still correct to say that those are provided
by libc, and that this is libc providing the headers. It doesn't mean
the syscalls can't go straight to the kernel and that the libc
headers can't just include/be the kernel ones.

Because glibc has to rely on underlying kernel services while the user
space programs are executed.
You know, Linux can be run on different architectures. Do you want to
keep different sets of header files for each arch? Yes, the APIs differs.
BTW: the user space programs don't necessarily need glibc. They may need
the kernel API headers, of course.
You may even want to use another C library. Would you copy the headers
in such case again?

Because?

No, it isn't. It's supposed to have a backward-compatible ABI.
You don't want to block progress, do you?
However, this isn't only about progress. A functionality can be removed,
too.

I'd go with the above, then.
