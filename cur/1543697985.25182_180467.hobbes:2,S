Hi!
On critical overheat (or perceived critical overheat -- acpi bioses on
some notebooks apparently report bogus values from time to time),
kernel itself calls /sbin/halt *without telling anything*. User can
not see anything, his machine just shuts down cleanly. Bad.
We should at least tell the user what is going on...
