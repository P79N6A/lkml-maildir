I personally am a _huge_ believer in small code. 
The sequence
	popl %eax
	popl %ecx
	popl %edx
	popl %eax
is four bytes. In contrast, the three moves and an add is 15 bytes. That's 
almost 4 times as big.
And size _does_ matter. The extra 11 bytes means that if you have six of
these sequences in your program, you are pretty much _guaranteed_ one more
icache miss from memory. That's a few hundred cycles these days.  
Considering that you _maybe_ won a cycle or two each time it was executed,
it's not at all clear that it's a win, except in benchmarks that have huge
repeat-rates. Real life doesn't usually have that. In many real-life
schenarios, repeat rates are in the tens of hundreds for most code...
And that's ignoring things like disk load times etc.
Sadly, the situation is often one where when you actually do all the 
performance testing, you artificially increase the repeat-rates hugely: 
you run the same program a thousand times in order to get a good profile, 
and you keep in the the cache all the time. So performance analysis often 
doesn't actually _see_ the downsides.
