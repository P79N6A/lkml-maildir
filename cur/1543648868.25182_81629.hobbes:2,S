Subject: Recovering data from a damaged ext2 partition?

I have a somewhat broken disk with some data I'd like to get back. I've 
run badblocks and according to it, most of the partition is ok, but 
apparently inode 2 and hence the root dir is unreadabe and so debugfs 
   can't seem to be able to do much.
Is there anything else I can do in this situation?
