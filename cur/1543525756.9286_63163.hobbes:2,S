Sorry that I'm coming into the middle of this thread, so I don't know
everything, but I would argue that multiple NICs on the same wire/hub would
be moderately useful in a few cases:
o Traffic accounting
You have a box hosting two sites, put one on one NIC and one on the other,
wouldn't that make it easier to sort out who/what is doing traffic to where?
Yeah, I know, aliases.
o Redundancy
I had a kernel panic tied to the NIC card driver once upon a time.  If I
would have had another NIC with different driver I coulda saved the trip to
reboot the box.
o Performance testing
On the grounds that transferring from one NIC to another in the same box
might be halfway useful, or throwing a LAN analyzer in there might help
debug stuff.
Then again, I am not a coder or hacker or major network guy, so I defer to
the judgement of the senior gurus.
