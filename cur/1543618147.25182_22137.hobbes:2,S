   It is said that the crashes cease when the `nopentium' option
   is used, so it does appear that something is up.
   
   I does seem that the nVidia driver is usually involved.
I think this is all "just so happens" personally, and all the that
turning off the large pages really does is change the timings so that
whatever bug is really present simply becomes a heisenbug.
