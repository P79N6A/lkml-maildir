The person copying the software (read: the poor user) - of course with
no doubt.
Is the manufacturer of a knife or rifle or car or brick responsible if I

And to solve the above "legal" problem, (at least in .at) it is
explicitly legal (and stated in the local law) to "copy" software for
personal use as long as you don't pass it on to others. And this
includes (of course) e.g. backup copies on DVDs (and remember, you are
not allowed to give them away, just store them in your desk).
