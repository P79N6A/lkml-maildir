I take great exception to arseholes like Colin Tenwick, vice president and
general manager European operations for Red Hat announcing that release
2.4 of Kernel would be formally released at the same time as Windows 2000. 
Who is he to come out with crap like this when it is obvious to everyone
that only Linus can make the decision in his own good time.
This did not make my day. 
Cheers, 
Alex
