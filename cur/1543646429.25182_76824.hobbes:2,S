Good point... Although I think it would be unfair, for example, to
be able to use BitKeeper to develop a _commercial_ product that
would compete with BitKeeper.
So, _maybe_ the license should be :
"
Notwithstanding any other terms in this License, this License is not
available to You if  You  and/or  your employer  develop,  produce,
sell,  and/or  resell a closed source (GPL, like CVS) product which
contains substantially similar capabilities  of  the BitKeeper Software,
or, in the reasonable opinion of BitMover, competes with the BitKeeper
Software.
"
But of course, who am I to decide... Larry ? ;-)
