This was also reported as
Suspected bug - System slowdown under unexplained excessive disk I/O - 2.4.13
with huge delays during compiles (sasha Pachev) or mysql-benchmarks (me).
But today I do not find this reiser-specific, this also seems to happen
with ext3.
But as you wrote, not with ext2. I see that there is more disk-activity
due to journaling in both cases, but waiting 30 seconds for simple tasks
or waking from screen-apm seems not to be right.
