Hi,
i am using mm3 now.
i think i know what my problem really is, i have 128MB of ram and about
160MB of swap space. Should not i have 2.5 times more that RAM?  Like
320MB. That could lead to enormous swapping. But still the lockups are
curious - even with ram outages and little swap space i should be getting
lots of continuos hdd load, which i do, but why would the system lockup
for 10 seconds with no disk activity?
I tried turning /proc/sys/vm/swappines to 0, and other values between 0
and 60. Also tried /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio 15 like you suggested, with
the same effects.
I will try to get more swap space, or maybe ram too and see if it helps.
Regards,
Maciej
