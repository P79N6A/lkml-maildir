I understand that 2.4 no longer maps all physical memory as 2.2
and earlier used to do.
Is there any documentation on this change and how it affects
arch-specific code?
Specifically, we've been basing the VAX port on 2.2 while waiting
for 2.4 to stabilize.  Now we're looking at moving to 2.4.
Thanks,
Kenn
