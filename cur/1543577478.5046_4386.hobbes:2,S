I'll be trying to move to 2.4.0 again soon.  First 2.4.0-test* I tried was
one that ate filesystems (reinstall, not pretty).  Second 2.4.0-test* I
tried, I tried to get UDMA working (ALi 1533) ate my filesystems
again.  Third 2.4.0-test*, I finally decided to give up on UDMA on my
hardware when I trashed my filesystems once again.  Tried changing the
80-conductor cable a couple times, and tried different hdparm options, but
no luck.  Sucks having two 7200RPM/2MB buffer/UDMA33 drives and only
getting 7.7Mbyte/sec off of them.  At least my system at work
(Athlon/Irongate) gets 24MB/sec without tweaking on one of those Maxtor
60MB/5400RPM drives.
Oh well, I'm just rambling now...I'll probably fire up 2.4.0 this weekend
on my main machine, so unless this error is capable of corruption, I'll
likely wait until then and just skip the 2.2.19 series.
Thanks,
