OK, noted.

I have yet to see a SMP system using different processors. Have you?

*What* kernel bloat?  Old kernel is 534902 bytes, this kernel is 535098
bytes. Hardly bloat. And I bet I could improve on that.
SunOS implements something very similar for its kernel. I do not like the
/proc system. I would rather see it binned and syscalls used instead.
