Can you post the output of lspci -vvv somewhere as well after trying 2.6.28?  
It may be that we want the "don't allocate resources for transparent bridges" 
patch after all:
diff --git a/drivers/pci/setup-bus.c b/drivers/pci/setup-bus.c

Since in your case it looks like it's incorrectly causing some of your other 
resources to be disabled:
pnp 00:02: io resource (0x22-0x22) overlaps 0000:00:04.0 BAR 7 (0x0-0xfff), 
disabling
pnp 00:02: io resource (0x92-0x92) overlaps 0000:00:04.0 BAR 7 (0x0-0xfff), 
disabling
pnp 00:02: io resource (0xb2-0xb3) overlaps 0000:00:04.0 BAR 7 (0x0-0xfff), 
disabling
pnp 00:0a: io resource (0x2e-0x2f) overlaps 0000:00:04.0 BAR 7 (0x0-0xfff), 
disabling
Sorry but you might have to build a few kernels to help us fix this one. :)
