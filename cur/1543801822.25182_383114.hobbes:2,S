Yes, it's a known problem to be fixed.  But, it's no excuse to do
_everything_ in the kernel (which OSS requires).

I stated above because I know it will be a discussion without a clear
end.  From the convenence viewpoint, doing everthing in the kernel
including the software mixing is fine.  But, do you want to it -- to
do EVERTHING in the kernel with a great risk of system down and the
programming restrictions (no FP, etc)?

And if the application doesn't support, who and where converts it?
With OSS API, it's a job of the kernel.

Could you tell me how do you handle the floating point in the kernel
code?

Don't get me wrong.  I, as ALSA developer, don't believe that OSS API
would disappear.  The API will remain.  But the implementation may
change.  That's all what is happening -- Adrian has asked to drop the
codes which are implemented differently (on ALSA).  No one requested
to drop the API support.
