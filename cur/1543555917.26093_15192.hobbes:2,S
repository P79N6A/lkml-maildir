Last night I was browsing the web and I came across a page with
LOTS of images.  There were so many that it drove my swap space
to ZERO.  I still had 3 Meg of memory, but the system became
virtually unusable and SLOW. (there were over 150 x 30k+ images
on one page). 
Is this something that the OOM would fix or is this another
issue altogether?
The machine has 
64Meg of swap space, 128 Meg of RAM, Dual 233MMX, Itis running
2.2.17 and Rh 6.2.
Any ideas?  thanks Joe
