No. This is what many UNIXes have done, and it sucks raw eggs through a
straw.
The problem is threads. Many of the above things are thread-specific, and
you MUST NOT have different pages mapped in different threads, because
that messes up the whole idea of threads (suddenly you cannot share
the same page tables in an SMP environment etc)

gettimeofday() is a great example of global state that really =is=
timing-critical. But very little else is (nobody _really_ cares whether it
takes 50 cycles or 2 microseconds to get the hostname)
