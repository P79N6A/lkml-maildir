Hmmm.. Your vmstat output looked a lot like our mail server when we
recently tried switching it to ext3.  We also saw large load spikes, but
I did not investigate it very closely.  Have you tried mounting as ext2
to see if journalling is responsible?
If it's a mail server, does it use dotlocking (creation and deletion of
lots of small/empty files)?  I haven't had any time recently to look at
this any further, but at the time I had guessed that this had something
to do with the constant write-out...
