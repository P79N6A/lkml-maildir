Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86_64 ptrace vs -ENOSYS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/17/5

When we're stopped at syscall entry tracing, ptrace can change the %rax
value from -ENOSYS to something else.  If no system call is actually made
because the syscall number (now in orig_rax) is bad, then we now always
reset %rax to -ENOSYS again.
This changes it to leave the return value alone after entry tracing.
That way, the %rax value set by ptrace is there to be seen in user mode
(or in syscall exit tracing).  This is consistent with what the 32-bit
kernel does.
