Hehe, it's a tiny function, and calls no further sub-routines
except debugging ones.   Still not necessary?

Just meant to be a little more compact ;)
+       unsigned long pos = file->f_pos;
+       unsigned long pgrahit = file->f_ra.cache_hits;
+       unsigned long pgaccess = 1 + pos / PAGE_CACHE_SIZE;
+       unsigned long pgcached = mapping->nrpages;
+
+       if (!pos)                               /* pread */
+               return;
+
+       if (pgcached > bdi->ra_pages0)          /* excessive reads */
+               return;
Here the f_pos will almost definitely has small values.
+
+       if (pgaccess >= pgcached) {
Fixed by adding a comment to clarify it:
+       unsigned long pos = file->f_pos;  /* supposed to be small */
