I looked at the get_dirty_limits() code and for the test cases I was running,
we have mapped > 90% of memory.  So what will happen is that dirty_ratio will 
be thresholded at 5%, and background_ratio will be 1%.  Changing values in 
/proc won't modify this at all (well, you could force background_ratio to 0%.)
It seems to me that the 5% number in there is more or less arbitrary.  If we 
are on a big memory Altix (4 TB), 5% of memory would be 200 GB. That is a lot 
of page cache.
It seems get_dirty_limits() would be a lot simpler (and automatically scale as 
memory is mapped) if the limits were interpreted as being in terms of the 
amount of unmapped memory.  A patch that implements this idea is attached.
(Andrew -- if it comes to that I can submit this patch inline -- this is just 
for talking at the moment).
I'll run a few of the tests with this modified kernel and see if they are any 
different.

Yep.  I can probably live with those minor differences though.  I would be 
happier if the system didn't swap anything at all for low values of 
swappiness, though.
