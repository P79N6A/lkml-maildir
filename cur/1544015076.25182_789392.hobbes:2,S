Subject: post 2.6.28 regression: device_initialize() now sleeps, and may fail without recovery strategy

From commit 2831fe6f9cc4e16c103504ee09a47a084297c0f3, "driver core:
create a private portion of struct device":
 void device_initialize(struct device *dev)
 {
+	dev->p = kzalloc(sizeof(*dev->p), GFP_KERNEL);
+	if (!dev->p) {
+		WARN_ON(1);
+		return;
+	}
+	dev->p->device = dev;
 	dev->kobj.kset = devices_kset;
 	kobject_init(&dev->kobj, &device_ktype);
First of all, this prevents initialization of struct device in atomic
contexts, such as drivers/firewire/fw-device.c::fw_node_event.
This is a bug in current mainline.
We can fix the bug by changing firewire-core, but
  a) it'd be more than a one-liner,
  b) who knows which other subsystems are affected.
Next, the above code is bogus.  In 2.6.28, device_initialize() could
never fail and was thus safe to use as a void-valued function.
How does driver core handle dev->p == NULL in subsequent usages of dev now?
