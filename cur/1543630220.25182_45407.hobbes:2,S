The more people, the merrier, but I am afraid that may subvert
the BOF. The problem is that nobody showed any convincing
proof that TOE actually works with benchmarks, let alone
in the real life. It was all a pretty groundless speculation so far.
I was on a conf call a week ago, where a guy said: "We implemented
TOE in the NT stack and achieved 100% speed-up", and I was like
"huh? and it tells me what? That NT stack was crap to begin with?"
I would like to keep the BOF on practical topics of Infiniband
implementation in Linux by any means necessary. TOE people
are welcome to come back when they have something working,
and when we know how fast the regular IP over Infiniband can go.
