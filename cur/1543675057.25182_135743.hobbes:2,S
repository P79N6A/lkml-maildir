Allow me to clarify... I don't mind drivers not working.  I *do* mind
drivers emitting hundreds of warnings and errors because dozens of things
were changed and no one cared to update everything they broke.  In some
cases, fixing things may be simple (eg. someone removed or renamed a field
in a struct somewhere) and in others years of work my be required (eg.
the new module interface.)
In my opinion (as it was in the long long ago), everything in a "stable"
release should at least compile cleanly -- "working" comes later after
users have been conned into using it.
