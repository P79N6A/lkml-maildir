The cli() is doing a lock across all processors. The local_irqsave won't
protect other processors against the modifications. The ISA side of the
OSS audio world is midbogglingly ugly for this and for lock_kernel
horrors but the PCI side isnt too bad.
The DMA pointers in ISA OSS are also touched by interrupt handling code
- which again cli() locked across all processors and lock_irq* doesn't.
Rusty submitted a much better patch for this - deleting all the old OSS
ISA drivers, so that people can just fix and use the ALSA code instead.
I'm not saying don't analyse the locks and interrupt paths and fix the
OSS audio for ISA stuff, just that it might not be the best use of time
even if you do get it sorted out.
