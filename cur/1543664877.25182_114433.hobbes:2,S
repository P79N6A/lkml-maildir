This can be true for older cards, but post-1998 hardware must follow
the spec.
PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture Specification, Rev 1.1, Dec 18, 1998,
pp 113-114:
 "... The interrupt binding defined in this table is mandatory for
  expansion boards utilizing a bridge.
  [table skipped]
  Device 0 on a secondary bus will have its INTA# line connected to
  the INTA# line of the connector. Device 1 will have its INTA# line
  connected to INTB# of the connector. This sequence continues and
  then wraps around once INTD# has been assigned."
I know for a fact that at least D-Link card mentioned in some reports
utilizes all four INT# lines, because I have one.
