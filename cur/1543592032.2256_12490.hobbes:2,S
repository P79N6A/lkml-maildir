I'm trying to call ioremap fairly early on in kernel init (and it
doesn't work ;-) )
What setup functions have to run before ioremap() will work?
I can debug exactly what it's doing now if I have to, but I
don't suspect it'll tell me much ... I'm calling from aroung
console_init in start_kernel.
Thanks,
Martin.
