Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/2] Use freezeable workqueues to avoid suspend-related XFS corruptions

Hi,
The following two patches introduce a mechanism that should allow us to
avoid suspend-related corruptions of XFS without the freezing of bdevs which
Pavel considers as too invasive (apart from this, the freezing of bdevs may
lead to some undesirable interactions with dm and for now it seems to be
supported for real by XFS only).
Greetings,
Rafael
