This indeed is possible, and has been implemented in the past.  Some
segmented architectures use different segments for different data types,
and a segment tag is part of the appropriate null pointer.  Also,
obviously, some pointer types are different widths on some
architectures.
The C languages was defined in such a way that it works fine on such an
architecture.  int *p = 0;  will always result in the appropriate null
pointer for integers.
The one exception is if you have a variadic function, in which case you
have to cast the null pointer to the right type, eg. 
printf("%s\n", (char*)0);
What's not allowed in conformant portable C is clearing pointers to null
using memset.  That just results in a zero bit pattern.
Eg.,
struct foo {
	int *bar;
} x;
memset(&x, 0, sizeof(x));
However, implicit initializers are valid, and will fill in pointer types
with the appropriate null value, eg:
struct foo {
	int *bar;
} x = {};
In addition, defining NULL as (void*)0 is completely broken.  A void*
null pointer is not valid as a null pointer for some other type - void*
is a transitional type, it simply holds the bit values of other pointers
so you can cast them back later.
