The average American computer illiterate instantly associates
"legacy" with "vast inherited wealth".  And majority of readers
of press release, not to mention reporters, will be computer 
illiterate. I know it (legacy) has become a part of the lexicon, 
but why not buck the trend and use a phrase which brings association 
of being tarnished with age?
Perhaps "rusty old", or "dusty-deck"?
