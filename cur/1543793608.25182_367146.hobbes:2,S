This is likely to be due to the PageReserved changes, as were other bttv
problems reported.  We're still working on the right patch for that,
or might even revert.  In the meanwhile you could try removing the
" | VM_RESERVED" from mm/memory.c get_user_pages(), to see if that
really does correct it (though it's not the whole of the right answer).
The OOPSes Duncan saw, I don't know about those: I wouldn't expect
them to be due to this cause, but could be wrong.
