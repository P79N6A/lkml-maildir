 Just for what the comment says: to map our IRQ number to an apic:pin
entity in O(1).  It has to be fast!  You would have to parse the MP table
otherwise -- see pin_2_irq().

 That's secondary, AFAIK.

 Possibly yes -- I haven't seen such a system.

 That's why it has to be fast.

 It appears it happens so for all systems checked so far.  The MPS does
not seem to enforce this configuration, so we might relax this dependency
for flexibility.  Note that not only find_isa_irq_pin() hardcodes this
assumption -- setup_ExtINT_IRQ0_pin() does as well, for example.
