Yeah, we've been talking about --gc-sections for years. It'd be nice
if we could work the build system in that direction with this
profiling concept.
(I suspect something silly happened in your test like dropping the
fixup table, btw.)

I'm still not sure about in-source annotations for popularity. My
suspicion is that it's just too workload-dependent, and a given
author's workload will likely be biased towards their code.
