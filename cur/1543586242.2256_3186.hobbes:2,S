A group of us from the handhelds.org site think that we have found a memory 
leak in the ramfs file system. After a long period of create and deleting 
small files in a mounted ramfs partition we have substantially less freemem.  
The problem has been confirmed on 2.4.2 on an i386 and StormARM ports.
The problem was found by a developer running an application on an iPAQ that 
quickly writes a 4K file to the ramfs, does some editing of the file and it 
then deleted. The application will quickly eat up all free memory and cause 
the platform to fail within 5 minutes.
Test case: from a shell, run this short script for a long period of time (over 
1 hour):
   i=0 ; while : ; do echo 1 >$i ; rm $i ; i=`expr $i + 1` ; done
This test was run  on an Compaq iPAQ 3650 using the 2.4.2-rmk1-np3 kernel from 
the CVS repository on cvs.handhelds.org.
The following two data points are the output from /proc/meminfo.  The first  
'cat' was done about 1 minute after the loop has been running. The second 
'cat' was done 10 minutes after the script loop had been killed.
