you are right, i forgot about kernel threads. If they are nice -10 on
Jack's system too then they are within striking range indeed, especially
since they are typically idle and if then they are active for short
bursts of time and get the maximum boost. Jack, could you renice these
to -5, to make sure they dont interfere?
btw., why are these at nice -10? workqueue.c sets nice value to -5
normally.
