your patch looks good to me - as long as we want to keep those 2 TLS
entries and nothing more. (which i believe we want.) If even more TLS
entries are to be made possible then a cleaner TLS enumeration interface
has to be used like Christoph mentioned - although i dont think we really
want that, 3 or more entries would be a stretch i think.
