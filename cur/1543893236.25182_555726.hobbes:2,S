So it will still work better than trying to do a "getsockname()" or 
something. If the file descriptor really _has_ been changed, it might give 
a false negative (somebody replaced it with *another* socket), but on the 
other hand, that's much better than a false positive. And if somebody 
replaced the socket with a real file descriptor, it will catch it..
