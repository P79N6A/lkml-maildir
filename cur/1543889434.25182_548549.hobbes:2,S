The file operations from filemap_xip are only effective if the struct 
file_operations vector refers to them (see ext2_xip_file_operations in 
fs/ext2/file.c as example). In oder to function proper, the 
corresponding address_space_operations vector needs to provide an 
implementation of get_xip_page (see ext2_get_xip_page in 
fs/ext2/xip.c). Both vectors are per inode, one can chose to have XIP 
for individual files in a file system.
so long,
Carsten
