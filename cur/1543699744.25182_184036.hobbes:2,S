Yes, the patch is only a simple workaround, nothing clever there!

I didn't know about the other breaks. I very much doubt that 2.96 is
still maintained.

Ok. This particular case is a simple compile error (which is caught
easily), not a hard to debug runtime bug in code generation.

True, although in this particular case the code can be argued to be very
ugly already. ;-)

Yes this is pretty old. But if it allows people to compile and therefore
test a kernel on older systems in setups equivalent to running
production systems this also has its value. Admit that gcc 3.x is about
twice as slow as gcc 2.9x. Not everyone is a developer with multiple
testsystems and a fast compilation machine that (cross)compiles for all
of them.

Yes of course, but often installing a new or dual gcc forces people
to install newer g++ and binutils which very much may break compiling
existing userspace applications.
I wholeheartedly agree that the latest compilers are a lot better, and
use them myself, but keeping on board willing testers is also *very*
valuable.
Submitting a patch for Documentation/Changes indicating that gcc 3.x is
now required might be appropriate, but I strongly think that is one of
the first actions for 2.7, not yet for 2.6.
