I'm not that motivated.  I did these to reduce some warning noise
a while back.  I just wanted to toss this out there before I dropped
it on the floor.  If it gets applied, great, if not, I'm not going to
be too bothered.
In many cases, there are lots of other inlines in those drivers too,
so it's a bigger job than the obvious fix that I did.
