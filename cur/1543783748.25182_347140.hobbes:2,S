I can't spot the problem, could you give me a hint?

  		case BPF_LD|BPF_W|BPF_ABS:
  			k = fentry->k;
   load_w:
-			ptr = load_pointer(skb, k, 4, &tmp);
+			if (k >= 0)
+				ptr = skb_header_pointer(skb, k, 4, &tmp);
+			else if (k < SKF_AD_OFF)
+				ptr = load_pointer(skb, k);
+			else
+				break;
The old value of ptr will be used in this case, it should
be explicitly set to NULL to abort.
