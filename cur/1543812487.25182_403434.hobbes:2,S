john> Atsushi: Your thoughts?
I agree.  I missed i386 lost tick case and it seems more complex than
x86_64 case.  Your patchset looks to make this cleanup very easy.
Then, here is an updated barrier fix patch.
Add an optimization barrier to prevent prefetching jiffies before
incrementing jiffies_64.
