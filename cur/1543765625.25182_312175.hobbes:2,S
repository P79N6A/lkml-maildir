This one probably should be a raw_spinlock. 
This lock is only held to protect access to the queues.
Since the queues are already priority ordered, there is
little benefit to ordering -the order of insertion-
in case of contention on a queue, compared with the complexity.
Just what you want to say to a guy who says he is tired  ;)
