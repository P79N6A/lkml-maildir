One major difference between bcm43xx-SoftMAC and b43-mac80211 is that the former always used a fixed
rate; whereas mac80211 tries to adjust the bit rate according to the transmission conditions.
Perhaps it isn't working quite right in your case because of some peculiarity of your AP. IIRC, you
have an 802.11b AP. If so, you will get the same bit speed behavior for mac80211 as for bcdm43xx by
issuing a 'sudo iwconfig eth1 rate 11M' command.
