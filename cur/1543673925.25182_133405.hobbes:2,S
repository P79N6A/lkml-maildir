they all can be smp_ things indeed

no, the spin_lock only acts as a barrier in one way, not both ways, so
an smp_something is still needed.
But yes, I think it can be a smp_rmb, so I can use the seqlock code.
> Why do you feel you need the mb()?
just because there are both reads and writes in the critical section,
but what matters is what we read not what we wrote. we must make sure
that we have read a real pagecache page outside the page_table_lock,
doesn't matter anything else, doesn't matter when our writes are
excuted (the code is just robust against not-oopsing), so s/mb/smp_rmb/
should do fine here and we can use the seqlock framework.

Well, that was a quick patch I was more focused on the design than the
implementation, so yes, now that we cleared the mb thing we can convert
it to the seqlock. As said my tree is still using the old names and
implementation of the seqlock, I don't think it's very important to
upgrade it, but maybe I should, comments? (I've a few patches that can
make a difference in my queue, so it will probably happen later if
something)

speed doesn't matter.
thanks for the help!
