Subject: 2.6.4 & new e100 driver: module load parameters

I think I'm missing something obvious, but the new e100 driver seems to 
have lost all the module load parameters (still) referenced in 
Documentation/networking/e100.txt, e.g. e100_speed_duplex.
Does the new driver support module-load-time configuration of these 
settings, or do I now need a startup script that hacks around with ethtool?
[and perhaps the e100.txt file needs to be updated?]
please forgive my ignorance... :(
cheers,
c.
