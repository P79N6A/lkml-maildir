I remember Zach was thinking about it when he was thinking of making vmi
a kernel module, but I don't think we discussed it with respect to the
current patching mechanism.  Though he did discover that at one point
alternative_instructions() was being run with interrupts enabled, which
caused surprisingly few problems...
But, yeah, it seems like it could be a problem.

Are misaligned/cross-cache-line updates atomic?
