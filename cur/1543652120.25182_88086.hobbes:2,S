Yes, see my emails from 23th Oct, 25th Oct (2.5.44: Strange oopses from 
userspace), from Nov 6th + Nov 7th: Preempt count check when leaving
IRQ.
But while yesterday I had no idea, today I have one (it looks like that
nobody else is going to fix it for me :-( ) :
seq subsystem can call arp_seq_start/next/stop several times, but
state->is_pneigh is set to 0 only once, by memset in arp_seq_open :-(
I think that arp_seq_start should do
  {
+   struct arp_iter_state* state = seq->private;
+   seq->is_pneigh = 0;
+   seq->bucket = 0;
    read_lock_bh(&arp_tbl.lock);
    return *pos ? arp_get_bucket(seq, pos) : (void *)1;
  }
and we can drop memset from arp_seq_open. I'll try it, and if it will
survive my tests, I'll send real patch.
