Sort of. Why not? Especially if the driver is GPL.

It evolves to promote standards. If both can use the same driver, then each
(if they both contribute) will reduce the development cost of the driver
by 1/n, where n is the number of manufacturs of similar boards.

Yes. One project that tries to do this for graphics is the GGI. They try to
separate the display control registers, timing registers, and data interfacing
to allow a mix-n-match the various drivers to come up with a unique 
combination that would work for a variety of boards.

This is a combined result. Usually the first one is a specific driver for
each device. If the drivers are GPL, somebody else may combine them, or the
second manufacturer may take the first driver, make some changes, and release
(under GPL) the modified driver. Then both manufacturers (or their engineers)
may collaborate to come up with a single driver.
Yes. The multiple mice implementations are an example. So are IDE drivers.

Yup. Everybody contributing. Everybody benifiting.
