It's amazing how much shiny new code turns up during the merge window
and screws things up.

    UBIFS: fix file-system synchronization
    Argh. The ->sync_fs call is called _before_ all inodes are flushed.
    This means we first sync write buffers and commit, then all
    inodes are synced, and we end up with unflushed write buffers!
    Fix this by forcing synching all indoes from 'ubifs_sync_fs()'.

WB_SYNC_HOLD got removed by
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/fs-remove-wb_sync_hold.patch
I think I'll just switch that to WB_SYNC_NONE.  The `wait==0' mode is
just an advisory thing to help the fs shove lots of data into the
queues.  If some gets missed then it'll be picked up on the second
->sync_fs call, with wait==1.
