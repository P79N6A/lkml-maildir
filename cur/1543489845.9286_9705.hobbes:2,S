Looks cool,  A couple of comment, though:
1. I'd like to see the sprintf() become and snprintf().  It'll save
   your life one day :)
2. s/S_IRUGO/S_IRUSR/, please.  It's not particularly dangerous
   information to leak, but it's currently not available to other
   processes, and don't really see the need to open it up.
Matthew.
