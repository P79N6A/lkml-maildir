I'm experimenting with a kind of central tendency with tasks that have not yet 
declared themselves high or low credit by weighting down the cpu run time 
when their credit is neither high nor low. Hopefully this can speed up 
application startup under load without too much general slowdown by current 
cpu hogs.
