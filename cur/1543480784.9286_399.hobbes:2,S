Hi,
I just noticed one thing: I can't get my BIOS brand and revision without
having to reboot the system !!
I thought this was impossible for the kernel to provide, but ... Windows
NT does the trick (NT Diagnostics). Thus ... my question is: is there,
currently, a way to get this info from the kernel w/o rebooting the
system? If not, don't you guys think it's a useful implementation ??
I've found several problems related to BIOS versions and such, and having
access to this information w/o having to reboot is really helpful.
Later,
Ivan Passos
