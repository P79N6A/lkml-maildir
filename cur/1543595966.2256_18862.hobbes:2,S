Hmm, I am shocked ;-)

Actually on some architectures you'd prefer the conditional branch
over the subroutine call when you can do predication like on the ia64.

But it's going to cost for the ones who do not support this.

One good example I can think off is when you update a dma descriptor
in PCI shared memory space (__raw_writel()). In that case you want to
be able to use posted writes so all writes is done in one PCI write
transaction instead of individual ones.
