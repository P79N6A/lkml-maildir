Subject: [PATCH 06/10] uml: run mconsole "sysrq" in process context

Things are breaking horribly with sysrq called in interrupt context. I want to
try to fix it, but probably this is simpler. To tell the truth, sysrq is
normally run in interrupt context, so there shouldn't be any problem.
There's also a warning from the fault handler because it's run in atomic
context (I have a patch for that, only I deferred it). This is why I'm doing
this.
