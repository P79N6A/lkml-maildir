	For 2.4.xx series it is enough to append this:
video=radeon:1024X768-8@100
	to get frame buffer console set to 1024x768, this does not work with 
2.6.0-testX. Radeon frame buffer is compiled in kernel. All I get is 80x30 
chars console with 60Hz refresh rate, and when penguin is displayed I get 
random coloured random chars on the right side of logo...
	I've asked this a while ago (during 2.5.5X phase) and did not get any answer, 
at least none that does the job.
	Beside this annoyance, 2.6.0 series work excellent for me...
