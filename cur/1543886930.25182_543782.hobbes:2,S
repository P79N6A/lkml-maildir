Hmmm ... that thread had some really neat and simple kernel-compliant
code, but it wanted to bring in a different compression algo :-) LZF, LZO,
LZW are all different.

Yeah, I hope the discussion here shifts (after the copyright issues
are resolved,
of course) to the submitted code itself. It's a compression library
also linked to
cryptoapi, so would definitely find users for itself -- this was later
submitted as
a patchset containing the JFFS2 glue code too.
But what I'm not sure about is the suitability of _this_ implementation to be
merged AS IS (~2500 lines of non-kernel-style, and even pointless, code is
no small thing) without a proper conversion / port to the kernel.
The upsides of a proper port would be nice: I suspect ~500 LOC in those
two headers would vanish, and perhaps an equal number in lzo.c (it even
re-invents memset, memcpy, etc for itself!).
The downside, as Richard said, would be that the kernel's LZO is no longer
diff-able with minilzo (the userspace library) which means someone who
takes on maintainership of this will have more work to do. (but how much
more would it be anyway?)
