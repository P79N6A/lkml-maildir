Don't shoot at me, please :) 
Well,  
 1) It worked with Pentium 150 on 75Hz bus
 2) it works on Win95, WinNT even on Cyrix MII (225, 3*75)
 3) it works on Linux, but only with no-hlt, or when CPU is not idle
 4) it works even without no-hlt kernel parameter with my Maxtor hard drive
 5) and I'm 75 % sure it didn't work at 233 (3.5x66) either. (CPU is not
overclocked) I'll double check it and apologize if I lied :)
So IMHO there's nothing wrong with my IDE interface.
I just thought linux-kernel people DO like bugreports.
