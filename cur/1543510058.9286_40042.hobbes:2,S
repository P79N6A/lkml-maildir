Hi Alan,
  something is wrong :-( I did not try versions before 2.3.18ac6,
but tulip driver in ac6 works, but in ac7 my ethernet card is not
recognized... It does not look like that driver has been changed
between ac6 and ac7.
  And another strange thing, ac6 is not able to correctly checksum
incoming tcp/udp frames (TCPv4 bad checksum .., UDP:
bad checksum, 100% fails or I missed someone correctly checksummed)
Checksums of transmitted frames are computed correctly. And ac7 does
not have this problem.
  But there is strange thing: tulip.o from ac6 is same as one from ac7,
tcp_ipv4.o is same too, also checksum.o & old-checksum.o from arch/i386/lib
do not differ, so I do not know, who is offender. And I did not find
anything relevant in ac patches :-(
    Box is dual PIII/450, 256MB RAM, 18GB IDE.
    Tools are gcc-2.95.2 19990906 (prerelease), binutils-2.9.1.0.25...
    Config is SMP, 686, 1GB...
  I suspected gcc, but because of object files are same, I'm not so sure.
Box did never oopsed due to bad hardware. Currently ac7 with de4x5 driver
works correctly, so you can mark it low priority :-) If I find, why it
is happenning, I tell you. But maybe that you have some simmillar reports
which could help me.
  If anybody is interested, I put my kernel binaries + config at
ftp://vana.vc.cvut.cz/private/kernels/ac
{6,7}{,.tar.gz}. If machine does
not respond, it has some troubles checksumming frames and/or driving
ethernet card :-(
                                            Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
