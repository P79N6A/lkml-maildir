Apart from questions of optimization, compiling the same code with two
different compilers is a very good way to find bugs, both in the code
and in the compilers.
Besides, the kernel is, for now, dependent on many gcc features; but
it might be worth thinking about writing code a bit more "standard",
just in case another free C compiler emerges on some specific arch. Then
again, aiming at compiling with several compilers is one way to achieve
portability.
(yet I do not believe it will happen anyday soon)
