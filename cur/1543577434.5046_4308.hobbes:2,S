As suggested, I added:
apm=power-off
to the kernel line of my grub menu.lst file and now I can power off. I almost
jumped when the machine snapped off - my bloody monitor doesn't go dark when it
loses signal it lights up with an RGB test pattern (TTX - don't buy one).
I think the real reason it wasn't working was that, although I'm using a
one-processor machine with a motherboard that only allows for one processor, I
had enabled SMP in the kernel, and this disables APM.
In my own work I mostly do multithreaded software development and I just sort of
felt like it would be good karma to enable it even if my machine didn't support
it.  Go figure.  So this was mostly a user error, although I guess I've been
helpful in discovering the current interaction of ACPI and APM.
I'll read up a bit more on ACPI and see what I can do with that later on.
Thanks for the help.  If you're in the neighborhood, stop by:
