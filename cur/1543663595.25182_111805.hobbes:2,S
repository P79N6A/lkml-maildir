NFS from the Shell (2.5.59) to the web/mail server as a client (2.5.61) 
works -if- i have --no-nfs-version 3 running.  However that immediately 
broke my 2.5.61 desktop (client of web/mail) which required I reboot it.
Again, not having --no-nfs-version 3 on the shell server cause it's 
client, the web/mail server, to get root handle errors.
