But I got the impression your patch enables mod15-quirk for all LBA48 
drives, is that correct? If so, if I have to update kernels here, I 
think I'll reverse that one if it affects all LBA48, as I'd rather 
not suffer the performance hit (its slow enough already because of 
slow CPU/chipset/contended PCI bus thank you very much ;) ) - until 
such time as a better fix is known.
