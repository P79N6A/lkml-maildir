   Most of the time that cast isn't needed and rather an indicator that
   something else is wrong, right now we don't even have a chance to detect
   such a situation.
Wrong.  This is legal:
int test(unsigned long a, int b)
{
	return min(a, b);
}
And the compiler will warn about it with your typeof version.
That is dumb and unacceptable.
