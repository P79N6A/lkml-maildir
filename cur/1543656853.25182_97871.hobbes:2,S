Try "make help"
That will teach you about:
make defconfig		<= Linus's own configuration (well more or less)
make allnoconfig	<= Minimal config, but often it does not compile
The reason "allnoconfig" often fails, is that for example some part of
the kernel may assume networking to be enabled. And in general
only few people try "allnoconfig", because the resulting kernel is
seldom of any use.
