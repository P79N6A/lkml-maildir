 Silicon Valley startup Google.com says its search engine is based on a
 patent-pending technology that "performs an objective measurement of
 the importance of Web pages and is calculated by solving an equation
 of 500 million variables and more than 2 billion terms."  How, then, to
 explain this:  A reader's search for the phrase "more evil than Satan
 himself" returned Microsoft's home page as the first result.
