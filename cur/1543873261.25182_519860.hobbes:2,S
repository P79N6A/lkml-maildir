I looked at the logs and the pointer isn't freed indeed. It is just a
false negative in kmemleak and it would appear as a leak at some
point. But the previous patch (do_tty_hangup) seems to fix one of the
leaks.
For the 2nd leak, proc_set_tty is called and, for symmetry, I added
put_pid in proc_clear_tty (but without any deep thought). I also
haven't checked any lockdep issues with adding put_pid when
p->sighand->siglock is held.
