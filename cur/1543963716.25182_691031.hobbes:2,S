The problem is that the interface for client drivers to query the
adapters capabilities is rather limited. There's just one bit for I2C
block read, so if an adapter has limitations in the size of requests it
can accept (beyond the traditional 32-byte limit that comes from SMBus)
it can't express it. This means that client drivers should expect
transaction requests to fail even if they checked that the transaction
type in question was supported. Most client drivers don't actually
expect that.
My advice would be to only bother implementing restricted support for a
transaction type if there's a big benefit in doing so. And then, double
check that all the client drivers that are likely to be used with the
adapter in question, are robust enough to deal with the restrictions
gracefully.
