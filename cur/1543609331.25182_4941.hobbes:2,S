Probably alignment restrictions do not allow anything interesting

I thought that would be the right thing to do when kdev_t is changed.
Currently, I do not know how to change it. Guy Streeter told me
that someone floated an insanely ugly patch that special-cased
shorts into do_proc_dointvec(), and I did not like that approach
too much. Once the structure of new kdev_t is known, the
do_proc_kdev_t may be defined, but I think it makes no sense
to jump the gun now.

Who knows if we are going to have majors and minors at all.
Suppose Gooch and Viro give us a decent devfs, or something.
An alternative may be to redo the initrd interface, for instance
have /proc/real-root-path instead of real-root-dev (and no sysctl),
I did not have time to explore all implications of that way.
