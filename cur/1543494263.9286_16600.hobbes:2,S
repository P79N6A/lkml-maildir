The TCP state transition diagram (the one I have) shows the
CLOSE_WAIT state as being entered upon receiving a FIN from
the other side.  We ACK that FIN - now we are in CLOSE_WAIT.
However, getting out of CLOSE_WAIT is up to **us** - we do a
close to the application and send a FIN back to the other side.
We now are in LAST_ACK which is where we are waiting for the
ACK to come back in response to our FIN.  This is where I would
anticipate being stuck by a DOS attack.  It should be handled
in the same way getting stuck in FIN_WAIT_2 is - quoting from
Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated vol2 p827: 
"Terminating an idle connection after more than 10 minutes in 
the FIN_WAIT_2 state violates the protocol specification, but
is practical. [...snip...] If the other process never closes its
end of the connection, our end can remain in the FIN_WAIT_2
forever.  A counter should be maintained for the number of 
connections terminated for this reason, to see how often this
occurs."
