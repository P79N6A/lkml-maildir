ext3 is different here, and uses the old-style buffer cache rather than
page cache. It has the equivalent case for a hole and/or IO error, and 
like ext2, it just continues with the next block.
I _think_ that case should be updated to do the same thing you did for 
ext2, but I'll leave it up to Andrew, since he is the ext3 master anyway.
Andrew?
