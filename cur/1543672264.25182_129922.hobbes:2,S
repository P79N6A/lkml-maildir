I found this problem in ppc64 and noticed that's it's in the other 64 bit
archs as well.  All except ia64 don't have the totalhigh, freehigh, and
mem_unit fields.  ia64 has the mem_unit field, but will give incorrect info
if totalram is greater than 4GB.  The 2.2 compatibility fix in sys_sysinfo
needs to be undone in these situations.
