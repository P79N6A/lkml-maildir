I've had such a behaviour with an HTTP reverse proxy I wrote, until I
realized that when you have thousands of connections, the select() call
slows down a bit, and the accept() was not called often enough to catch
all the new connections. I simply solved the problem by calling as many
accept() as possible each time the listen socket wakes up. I'm pretty
sure you are in such a situation.
Cheers,
