Subject: [0/48] Suspend2 2.1.9.8 for 2.6.12
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As requested, here are the patches that form Suspend2, for review.
I've tried to split it up into byte size chunks, but please don't expect
that these will be patches that can mutate swsusp into Suspend2. That
would roughly equivalent to asking for patches that patch Reiser3 into
Reiser4 - it's a redesign.
There are a few extra patches not included here, all of which are not
core to Suspend2. Since I'm not expecting this code to get merged as is,
I haven't worried about including them. If that's a problem, let me know.
Regards,
Nigel
