I would disagree.  I think its better to push (and get merged) patches
to move the files first; then add microblaze on top of that.  You can
start getting stuff merged piecemeal that way instead of relying on
getting your entire patch series merged at once.
However, that's just my opinion, others may look at it differently.
Cheers,
