Which is inaccurate, but a natural step in language usage.  I think it
is reasonable to call software distributions that use the Linux kernel
`Linux distributions' since the creation of this kernel was the
trigger for the creation of those distributions.  It may seem unfair
that GNU doesn't get credited for providing many of the tools that
made those distributions possible, but that's just tough.  GNU isn't
the only project that goes uncredited when people refer to a complete
system using the Linux kernel as `Linux', but it's the only one that
has whiners that complain about this.
We're only talking about software here, not a group of real people
being given some sort of an insulting name.
