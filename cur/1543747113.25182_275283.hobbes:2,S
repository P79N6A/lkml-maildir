These functions are part of an overall interface between the AVC and the
security server designed to support dynamic security policy
requirements, based on prior studies including some formal analysis. 
While the example security server does not presently use anything other
than avc_ss_reset, I'd be hesitant to completely remove the rest of the
interface, as that will leave a far less functional interface for future
security servers and may lead to further "optimization" of the AVC that
will preclude support for dynamic policy requirements (or at least make
it much harder to restore such support).

There are patches under development for SELinux that make use of this
function, including exporting the interface to userspace via selinuxfs
and using it in-kernel for polyinstantiation.
