Sure. I'm having a problem inside kset_find_obj() when actually using 
it though, and I'm not sure if it's my fault or not. It seems there are 
kobjects present for which kobject_name() returns NULL.
kset_find_obj:
	list_for_each(entry,&kset->list) {
		struct kobject * k = to_kobj(entry);
		if (!strcmp(kobject_name(k),name)) {
			ret = k;
			break;
		}
	}
where "kset" above is "&my_bus_type.devices". strcmp doesn't like NULL 
and panics. I've registered 11 devices in my_bus_type, and all of them 
have names (device_add() makes sure of that).
Does this sound like my fault?
