I've grown to dislike Seagate over the last year.  You are probably not
wrong.
I assume this means a bad sector:
Aug 31 11:24:49 hoppa kernel: hda: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Aug 31 11:25:20 hoppa kernel: ide0: reset timed-out, status=0x80
Aug 31 11:25:20 hoppa kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
Aug 31 11:25:20 hoppa kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Aug 31 11:25:55 hoppa kernel: ide0: reset timed-out, status=0x80
Aug 31 11:25:55 hoppa kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
Aug 31 11:25:55 hoppa kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:05 (hda), sector 524327
Aug 31 11:25:55 hoppa kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
on a disk which is less than a month old.  Although this corruption
could be a result of the previous crashes.
Oh, well time to hassle my supplier.
Thanks for the assistance,
Nicholas
