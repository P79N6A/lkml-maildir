It also happens when a symbol is undefined, so this patch is a bad idea.
To do this properly you would change strong_try_module_get to return -EBUSY 
and -ENOENT, then change use_module(), then finally resolve_symbol(), then 
only print a warning when it returns something other than -EBUSY.
Better might be to put in a waitqueue and wake it up whenever a module is 
deleted or changes status.  Then use_module() can wait if 
strong_try_module_get() returns -EBUSY (up to 30 seconds, then print a 
warning and fail).
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
