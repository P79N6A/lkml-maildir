Hi Greg,
Some times ago, you fixed an oops in i2c-core when debugging is enabled:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107585749612115&w=2
Looks like you missed that second one:

Reported by Emil Svensson on IRC. Sensors-detect would trigger the oops
(through i2c-dev), I could reproduce it easily. Works OK after applying
the patch above.
Please apply,
Thanks.
