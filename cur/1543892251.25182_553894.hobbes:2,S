It seems strange that a new C source file (mlguest.c) appears in the top dir of the 
kernel source. There are some problems with it.
First, I used `make mlguest.o` to compile that file, but I got tons of warnings and errors.
(Too many to put here.) What's wrong with it? Or I didn't compile/configure it correctly?
Second, mlguest.c #includes a head file named "../../include/linux/lguest_launcher.h".
Since mlguest.c is in the top dir, so where is ../../include/linux/lguest_launcher.h?
