Yes, 2.6.12..2.6.13-rc1 was pretty big, However, the IDE driver changes 
aren't that big.
None of your bug-reports seem to say even what driver you're using, 
though, so it's a bit hard to make any judgement at all.
We at a minimum need to know what driver, and see boot messages (both
working and nonworking), and preferably things like "hdparm -I" output 
(again, both working and nonworking) too. Often "lspci -vvx" is useful 
too.
