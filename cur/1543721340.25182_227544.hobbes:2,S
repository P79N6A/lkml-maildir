How does auditing work in the event of a process failure ? There would
be
no system call triggered in that case.  Also, my initial thoughts are 
that the non-invasive Kmonitor is lesser performance impact when
compared
to auditing. I would spend some time developing sample code to confirm
it.
I have not looked at the task ornament patch. If you could send me a
link.
Thanks,
