The kernel doesn't know whether you got into the system using a
kerberized rsh, ssh, telnet, or by a buffer-overflow.
The 'authenticated' user in fact already got his kerberos tokens on the
system he is logging in from. The kerberized rshd simply adds the token
used as authentication to the new session, if it is a TGT it can be used
to obtain AFS and other credentials either from within the daemon or
through commands in a .login script (using afslog or aklog or something).

Which actually seems logical to me.

You could have the kerberized rshd remember the tokens it obtained
during a previous login or were forwarded by the client and associate
them with the new PAG. No need to join an existing PAG.
What you propose has completely different behaviour depending on whether
the user happens to have a secondary permanent connection to the target
host or not. If there is no permanent session there will be no PAG to
join and each rsh invocation will have to reauthenticate anyways.
