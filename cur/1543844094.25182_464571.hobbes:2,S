Then we would have to determine what the scenarios are. The problem is to cover
all interesting instrumentation mixes efficiently.
I think it could be a good enough list :
Fprobes only
Dynamic + Fprobes (supports dynamic probes and uses fprobes for non probable
                   code)
Dynamic only
Printk only
Which would be expressed in the following menu :
choice Marker behavior
  * Inactive
  * Dynamic probes
  * Function probes (Fprobes)
  * Dynamic probes complemented with Fprobes
  * Printk
if selected "Dynamic probes" or "Dynamic probes complemented with Fprobes"
  choice2 Dynamic probes behavior
    * Kprobes
    * Jprobes
Any thoughts ?
Mathieu
