You keep "quoting" a particular version of lint as the official rules.
Can you back up that this version of lint is 100% correct WRT to the
ANSI C standard?
According to K&R2, a selection statement is of the form (where I've put
_word_, the book uses italics):
 if ( _expression_ ) _statement_
 if ( _expression_ ) _statement_ else _statement_
 switch ( _expression_ ) _statement_
_expression_:
 _assignment-expression_
 _expression_ , _assignment-expression_
_assignment-expression_:
 _conditional-expression_
 _unary-expression_ _assignment-operator_ _assignment-expression_
_assignment-operator_:
 = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=
And the text says "The type of an assignment expression is that of its
left operand, and the value is the value stored in the left operand
after the assignment has taken place."
So, if you write
if (i = fork()) { /* do something */ } else { /* do something else */ }
the "i = fork()" is an assignment expression.  Its value is the value of
"i" after it gets the return value from fork().  According to the text
for selection statements, the expression is evaluated and "if it
compares unequal to 0, the first substatement is executed."
This is perfectly valid C.  Doing this can be confusing and is usually
in error where someone meant '==' instead of '=', so most compilers (and
apparently your version of lint) warn about it.

Do you have a C++ lint instead of a C lint?  This is warning about
something not being a boolean type, which does not exist in C.
Basically, either your lint is trying to be helpful and give you
warnings about possibly unintended things, your lint is broken and is
giving errors about valid things, or you are trolling by complaining
about problems with gcc that are really in your head.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
