 Can't it be?

 Do you need to pass NMIs to VM at all?  NMIs as defined by the PC/AT
architecture are delivered as a result of memory parity errors or ISA
IOCHK errors.  Is that functionality really needed in VM?

 It depends on the application -- you may avoid problems by careful coding
and a nested NMI will never happen -- the CPU masks the NMI line
internally, from accepting an NMI till a subsequent iret.
