Subject: 2.2.6 problems for SX164
I can't send you the error message, but basically, I can't log into my
Alpha SX164 with kernel 2.2.6.  It dumps an oops message and the login
prompt pops right back up.  After several attempts to log in, the computer
finally locks up.

Here's an update.  I can boot into single user mode, but when I try to login
in init 3, I get the following:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address fffffe000002d8e8
init(1): Oops 0
followed by the oops info.
