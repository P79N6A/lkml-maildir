BTW. Please do:
bk rm include/asm-ppc64/offsets.h
This file is generated, it's plain wrong to distribute one and
could explain all sorts of strange things :)
(It contains the offsets into some kernel data structures to be
used by the asm code)
Andrew: If you have such a file in your tree, remove it from the
distribution too. I'll check if it's part of the make distclean
process, I'm afraid it may not...
