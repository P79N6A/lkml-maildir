Ok, thanks for the pointer. it's a completely differnt sort of race you're
talking about ;)
I'll have to look at the -mm tree and how the locking is different
there before commenting further.

Ok. i didn't think it necessary given it's use in several other places
and the comment at the head of __put_super_and_need_restart() explain
exactly what it does and when to use it. Comment added anyway.

I thought you were referring to shrink_dcache_parent(). At least, I
was, and the hunk of diff that your comment followed after was from
select_parent(). Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we're
agreeing that it's doing the right thing in select_parent().
The modified shrink_dcache_sb() doesn't do do any list moving at all,
it simply frees all the dentries on the superblock in a single pass.....
Cheers,
Dave.
