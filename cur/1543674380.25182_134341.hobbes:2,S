"don't touch memory that doesn't exist" is a bad idea unless there is *some*
sort of API that allows the program to intuit what does/doesn't exist.  If
the program can't find out what is legal without hitting an oops or worse,
nobody will use /proc/kcore, and then why bother implementing it?
(Note that I'd consider "look *here* for a pointer to known-existing memory,
then look 24 bytes into there for a pointer to a linked list of memory
block address/size pairs" sufficient, no need for a fancy /proc interface.
Of course, that's just my opinion - those who don't have memories of
pointer chasing in S/360 assembler under OS/MVT may have other opinions ;)
