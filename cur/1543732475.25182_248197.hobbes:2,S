I expect it's because:
  fill_kobj_path(struct kset *kset, struct kobject *kobj, char *path, int length)
  get_kobj_path_length(struct kset *kset, struct kobject *kobj)
and therefore the exported:
  kobject_get_path(struct kset *kset, struct kobject *kobj, int gfp_mask)
are all passing the kset. If they all are not needed, they can go too?

Hmm, in most cases this will work. But in mandates the creation of an
attribute instead of the lazy signal string. Yes, it would be nicer in
the long run and closer to the idea, that the whole event data should be
available through sysfs, but it may be hard to reach this in some subsystems.

What should we do in the hotplug case? We may send a NULL attr for
the kset creation. But how can we distinguish between "add" and "remove"?
Just by looking if we find the sysfs dir? I'm not sure in this case.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Kay
