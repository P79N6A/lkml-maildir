Yes, it is necessary to distinguish these situations. I think the
EFI_LOADER_SIG defined above can be used for that. For example the
following signature can be defined:
32-bit EFI	EL32
64-bit EFI	EL64
All other values will be treated as no EFI present.
If struct setup_data proposed by H. Peter Anvin is used for EFI
information passed from bootloader, two "type" can be defined for 32-bit
EFI and 64-bit EFI, such as SETUP_DATA_TYPE_EFI_32 and
SETUP_DATA_TYPE_EFI64. If either type is not presented in "linked list
of struct setup_data", it is considered that EFI is not present.
