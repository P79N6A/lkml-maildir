So what do you recommend when  the  requirement  specification  lists
features as
- Web interface (interface to electronic program guide database)
- network interface (up- / download to normal PC over ethernet)
- IEEE1384 interface (for digital cameras)
- USB interface (for keyboard, printer)
...
Would you start from scratch, or buy component by component, or  just
use Linux?

Please let me keep my mouth shut about WinCE.
But yes, there are situations where "the various RT/unix knock-off's"
are the optimal solution (fastest time to market, lowest  cost,  most
features, highest reliability).

Maybe. As application. So what?  That  does  not  mean  that  the  OS
kernel, device drivers etc. may not be available under GPL.

I see. Yes, there are problems of that class. But that's not what I'm
talking about.

??? What are you talking about?

Definitely. I learn a lot each day.
