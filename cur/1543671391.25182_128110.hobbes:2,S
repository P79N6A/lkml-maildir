If you just take the current script, there is little point in a
translation. But if you could merge it sanely with
scripts/checkincludes.pl, that might be nice.
Now, how does one check all c files for all implicitly included
symbols without writing a complete c parser or generating tons of
false positives? Maybe you can play some trick with "gcc -C -E".
