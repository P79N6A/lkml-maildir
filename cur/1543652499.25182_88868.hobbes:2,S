Hi,
sorry for the intrusion. I noticed iostats didn't display statistics for
devices on Mylex RAID constrollers. Det statistics are completely
missing in /proc/stat. The reason seems to be an assumption that disks
have major numbers which are below 16
(
http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/kernel_stat.h#L15
) which is
used by 
http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/proc/proc_misc.c#L344.
Devices on Mylex-controllers have major number 48. Would it break
anything if DK_MAX_MAJOR if set higher (e.g. 64)?
AFAIK this goes for both 2.4 and the 2.5 series.
