These need to go, I believe:
input-core-implement-class-hierachy.patch
input-core-implement-class-hierachy-hdaps-fixes.patch
input-core-remove-custom-made-hotplug-handler.patch
input-convert-input-handlers-to-class-interfaces.patch
input-convert-to-seq_file.patch
Or you can take your chances with
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/2.6.14-rc1-mm1.5.gz
 which
is kinda rc1-mm1 without those 28 patches.
