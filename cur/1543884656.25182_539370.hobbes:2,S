Subject: [PATCH] Invalid return value of execve() resulting in oopses
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Alexey Kuznetsov <alexey@openvz.org>
When elf loader fails to map executable (due to memory shortage or
because binary is malformed), it can return 0. Normally, this is 
invisible because process is killed with SIGKILL and it never returns
to user space.
But if exec() is called from kernel thread (hotplug, whatever)
consequences are more interesting and vary depending on architecture.
i386.   Nothing especially interesting, execve() just returns 
        with "success"  :-)
x86_64. Fake zero frame is used on way to caller, RSP/RIP are loaded
        with zeros, ergo... double fault.
ia64.   Similar to i386, but r32...r95 are corrupted. Sometimes it 
        oopses due to return to zero PC, sometimes it sees NaT in 
        rXX and oopses due to NaT consumption.
