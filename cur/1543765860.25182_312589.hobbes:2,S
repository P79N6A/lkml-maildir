I don't think so, because ACT process must stop service logic to
takeover, if the service use network listen port.(ACT process need to
stop service and close socket to take over.)

For me, is seems very dangerous to estimate the primary copy is not

I think your assumption works on some type of process, but not for all
the process.
Some process use critical resources such as fixed network listen port
can not speed up so.
More importantly, the only process who prepare to use this mechanism
only allows to use quick process takeover. This cause software
development difficult.
The live patching does not require to implement such special techniques
on applications.
