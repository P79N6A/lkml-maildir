So turn off fscks, and add "nocheck" to your fstab. If you're testing
fragile stuff, you don't want your life-critical files near it anyway.
Concerning the lack of continuous availability of features: it's quite
normal that things get broken in development kernels. As a distribution
maker, you should have a fallback strategy for this, e.g.  to use
multiple kernels to develop different parts of your distribution.
