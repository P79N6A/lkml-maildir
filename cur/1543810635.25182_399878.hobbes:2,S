Actually, distros started to do swsusp-resume-from-initrd long before
uswsusp -- because of scsi modules. So that complexity exists
already...
Anyway somehow simplifying/kernelizing initrd would be nice. Right now
I'm using read-only ext2 as poor-mans initrd (because it is easier to
set up that way).
