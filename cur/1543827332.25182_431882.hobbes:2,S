It just means that we suck at producing stable kernel interfaces.
Moving everything into the kernel doesn't magically solve problem, it only 
shifts the problem.
You still had to define the boundaries - how does it interface with the 
rest of the system. This is the part I'm currently trying to figure out 
regarding klibc.

Well, it's common practice. If we start making exceptions, everyone wants 
one, so it IMO would need a very, very good reason to merge this as is.
