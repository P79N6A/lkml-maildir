Jan did mention this in the previous thread, but as Jens said,
these problems would occur only the _first_ time someone
transitions from the old .config's to the new scheme. But those
"default y"s for all the various "configmenu"s (let's please call
them that) that got introduced in the Kconfig files would cause
unnecessary annoyance to users of make oldconfig _for ever_.
