Right, but hopefully you can tell it's a SuSE machine via other means, and
then apply a suitable workaround.
Or are you claiming that SuSE is *so* weird that you can't even apply a
test like:
if [ -test $SuSE ]; then
	echo Smells like a SuSE box - which of the following best describes your box?
	i=1
	for foo in ($likely_dirs) do;
		echo ${i}: $foo
		i=`expr $i + 1`
	done;
	read flavor
	echo You chose $flavor...
	ln -s /usr/src/linux/$flavor my_build
