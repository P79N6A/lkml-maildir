Hmm, I only wish...

You named your X32 "amd"?  How ... confusing ... (assuming it, like all
other Thinkpad X series I know, has a Pentium M.)

That's quite a bit better than mine, and I am pretty sure I am the same
vintage or newer (purchased this summer), but I'm getting barely half
that speed:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   58 MB in  3.10 seconds =  18.70 MB/sec
How can I find out what disk is in this beast and try to track down some
of my missing performance?  It looks like I have the right DMA settings
and whatnot looking at hdparm(1).
