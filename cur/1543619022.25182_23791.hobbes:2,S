I think this is a big part of the problem.  What's needed, and what Alan
used to provide, is a maintainer for the miscellaneous parts of the kernel
that aren't covered by the various subsystem maintainers.  We need someone
who can accept that one or two line fix, get it tested, and make sure Linus
sees it.
I gather Dave Jones is taking on that role to some extent.  If so, perhaps
he should be officially listed in the MAINTAINERS file.  Whether it's Dave
or someone else, I think this is a critical need.
