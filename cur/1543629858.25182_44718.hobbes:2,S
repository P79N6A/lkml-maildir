I am curious what the definition of memory barriers is for IA64, Sparc,
and x86-64.  
From what I can tell, sparc and x86-64 are like alpha and map directly
to the existing mb, wmb, and rmb semantics, incluing ordering between
system memory and I/O space.  Is that an accurate assesment?
IA64 has both the mf and mf.a instructions, one for system memory the
other for I/O space.  What is required for ordering of references
between the spaces?  That is not clear to me looking at the ia64
headers.
Thanks for any input -
Dave.
