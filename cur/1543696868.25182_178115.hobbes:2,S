A week or so ago I asked if cryptoloop was support in 2.4 now that it has 
crypto. I was told yes, I tried util-linux-2.12 with 2.4.22-ac4 and it 
didn't work. So I rebuilt everything, and this time built the util-linux 
under 2.4 instead of 2.6.0-test9, and it still doesn't work.
If I misunderstood that I no longer need to add an external crypto code, 
sorry I didn't make the question clear. If this is now supposed to work, 
here is a zip with the config and the log file from my attempts.
file created with "dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024k count=10 of=/tmp/test.cld"
I tried using -E and some numbers, and -e and some defined types, without 
success, other than the insecure -E 1 (xor) mount. Since I would like to 
share filesystems between 2.4 and 2.6 it would be nice if this worked, and 
if it doesn't... so be it.
