Ugh.  Why new ioctls?  Can't most of these be done other ways?  Like
sysfs or open/write/read/close?
Adding new ioctls is generally frowned apon greatly.

Woah, you are creating your own pci_dev?  No.  Only the pci core can do
that.  Lots of bad things happen if you are doing this.  I'm amazed that
your code even works this way, please fix it.

Use dev_dbg() and friends instead of pr_debug().  Also, use dev_err()
and dev_warn() for your other calls to printk().

Can't these two calls be done by lookin in the existing /proc/iomem
file?  Or, if not that one, some other /proc/*mem file?  Not sure
exactly what you are doing with this read/write stuff...

Why use down_interruptible() everywhere?  Can this stuff be called from
an interrupt somehow?

So, any user can do any of these ioctl calls?  Isn't that a little bit
insecure?
Also, please run this through sparse and fix the warnings it give you.
