But can more be done? Andi's not pointed anything out in particular (unless I 
am mistaken), but could more of ALSA be configurable, even if it is at the 
expense of userspace API features?
As has already been pointed out, individual ALSA drivers with comparable 
features tend themselves to be smaller than the original OSS ones. It's the 
ALSA infrastructure that comes at a cost, and surely not all if it is 
mandatory.
