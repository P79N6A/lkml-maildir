Yes, otherwise apps that do
if (S_ISDIR()) {
	..
} else if (S_ISREG()) {
	..
}
would behave differently from apps that check the file in
different order, and they would probably break because in
a regular fs that order is not important. The goal is to
keep the semantic changes as hidden as possible for apps
that don't know about the new features.
