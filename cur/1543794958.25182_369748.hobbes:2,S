That may be the right thing, but looking at compat-ioctl.c I don't see 
anything that really depends on ext3, it just wants to have the data 
structure definitions in _case_ ext3 migth be enabled. Or did I miss 
anything?
In general, I don't like code that depends on a module having been marked 
as a module. What if you compile the kernel and then decide later that you 
need the jbd/ext3 modules, so you compile and install those on an already 
running kernel? 
So almost all "#ifdef CONFIG_xyzzy_MODULE" usages tend to be fundamentally 
buggy: they expect all modules to come pre-configured, which may be ok for 
a distro kernel, but it's a bit against the whole point of being a module, 
isn't it?
