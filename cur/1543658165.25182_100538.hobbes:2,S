glad to know I'm not the only one.
someone pointed out to me in a private e-mail, that the corruption may be
related to my VIA KT133 chipset. (they had a similar problem).

sorry about the thinko in my mail. I meant 2.4.21-pre1. Glad to know I'm not
crazy, but hopefully confirmation means it'll get fixed before 2.4.21-final.

maybe I just missed the arguments since I wasn't reading LKML at the time;
but *why* is IDE being revamped in the middle of a "stable" kernel series?
however better it may be, I don't regard the existing situation as being bad
enough to justify the risk.
