Nope. My personal experience with these orbses is: f*ck them.         
A good lot of them are _not_ contacting blacklisted ISPs. But on the  
other hand, some at least allow fast _unlisting_.                     
I give you the simple and well-thought hint _not_ to use a mail       
configuration relying on _external_ databases whatsoever. I mean why  
do you trust somebody you have never met or seen or maybe even talked 
to to _filter_ your email traffic. This is obviously most ridiculous  
and has _nothing_ to do with security.                                
I mean just sit down and think it over for a minute...
