I think the point is it can be made to work in userland, not that a
particular shell isn't able to do that.  In fact, I'm a bit dissapointed
that shells such as zsh and bash seem to lack an easy way to do that. But
really, this is theoretical, I think nobody is really advocating getting rid
of /dev/null and /dev/zero.

The way I see it piping is independent from shells just because it can be
accomplished in userland using the present linux system calls.

Why is that? I see nothing bizarre in that.

Again, I think it can be done in userland. Some shells even give you
convenient syntax for that. This works in zsh:
head -2 <(yes) <(uname)
==> /proc/self/fd/11 <==
y
y
==> /proc/self/fd/12 <==
Linux
So you can pipe arbitrary program output as a filename argument.
I guess you example could be written as
ebcdic2ascii < /dev/ttyS1 | tr A-Z a-z | bindiff <(zerofill) /dev/stdin
 
but I'm not sure since I have no idea your example does ;) ;).
