Eric,
Ask Leroy in Longmont how it should behave.
6-10 seconds is a nice idea, the reality as we both know it is up to 30
seconds to return because of OOB seeks to write on reallocations.
FLUSH CACHE/FLUSH CACHE EXT ...
If you have a drive that is not larger than 28-bit in geometry regardless
if it supports the 48-bit feature set, if it fails to comply with 28-bit
flush cache it is a "BAD DEVICE", period.  You will not be allowed to push
off the 48-bit feature set rules.  Regardless if the new smart data is
set the the GPL and not Smart Logs.
If you are suggesting a pole for completion on the FLUSH, say so.
Otherwise, standard non-data INTQ completion is default.
Cheers,
