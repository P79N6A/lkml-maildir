Doug,
After upgrading a dual PII 333 ASUS motherboard to PIII 500s, I find
myself plagued with SCSI timeouts.  The controller is an on-board
AIC-7890/1 Ultra2.  One disk attached, an IBM 9LZ U2W LVD.  Cable is
proper LVD w/ terminator (supplied by board mfgr).
With the slower processors, the system ran flawlessly for ~3 months.  I
may have seen one or two SCSI timeouts in that entire period.  Now, they
are frequent and annoying.  There seems to be little correlation with
load.  Kernel options are:
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_TCQ_ON_BY_DEFAULT=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE=24
# CONFIG_AIC7XXX_PROC_STATS is not set
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY=5
Here is a sample of the log entries:
Sep 27 20:58:43 pii kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid
    8108, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 0x28 00 00 64 e5 75 00 00 28 00 
Sep 28 04:02:31 pii kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid
    15014, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 0x28 00 00 27 7a 13 00 00 02 00
Do you have any suggestions for parameter tweaking?  Is the IBM 9LZ noted
for firmware problems?
Thanks in advance for any input.
Steve
