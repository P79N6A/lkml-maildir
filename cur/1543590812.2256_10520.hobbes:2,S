He did 53c710+. The 700 and 700/66 are much less capable devices.
According to 
http://www.murphy.nl/~ard/systems/pws/pws/node18.html
the NCR 53c700/66 is mapped at 0xCC0-0xCFF.
The system board id looks interesting too. I wonder if its related to
the mac address.. Sadly my box is dead so I cant poke
