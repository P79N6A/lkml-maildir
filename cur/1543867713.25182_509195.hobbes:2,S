this issue, and these holes keep comeing up in discussions, why can't these 
holes be closed? I seem to remember seeing patches that would remove /dev/kmem 
being sent to the list, but they weren't accepted into the kernel (and I seem to 
remember people being against the concept of removeing them, not against 
techincal details of the patches. but this was many years ago)
at one point I remember hearing that X required raw /dev/kmem, but for servers 
you don't need/want X anyway, so this is a useful option even if X doesn't get 
fixed.
