It's a bug in compiler-gcc3.h, and I already sent the patch below in 
this thread.
I'm currently sending fixes for compile errors this causes with gcc 3.4 
(I've forgotten the exact number, but there were compile errors in at 
about 30 files in a full i386 compile).
<--  snip  -->
[patch] #define inline as __attribute__((always_inline)) also for gcc >= 3.4
Rationale:
- if gcc 3.4 can't inline a function marked as "inline" that's a
  strong hint that further investigation is required
- I strongly prefer a compile error over a potential runtime problem
