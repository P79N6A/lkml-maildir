>I'd be happy to write a new routine in assembly
I sincerely hope you're joking.
It's the algorithm that needs fixing, not the implementation of that
algorithm.  Writing in assembler?  Hope you're proficient at writing in
x86, PPC, 68k, MIPS (several varieties), ARM, SPARC, and whatever other
architectures we support these days.  And you darn well better hope every
other kernel hacker is as proficient as that, to be able to read it.
IOW, no chance.
