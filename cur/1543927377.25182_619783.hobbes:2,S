Again I don't see the point of this change. A routine for cleaning up
resource tables expects logically to be passed a resource table to clean
up not some device it may be attached to.
Perhaps if you could explain where you are trying to end up, it would
help understand what you are trying to do.
I don't see why pnp_dma() and pnp_irq() should change either. It just
causes noise and breaks driver code. I don't see where it needs to change
to make internal pnp changes work ?
