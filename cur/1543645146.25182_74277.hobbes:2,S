Please redesign this structure.
   +struct addrselect_attrs {
   +	struct inet6_ifaddr *ifp;
   +	int	match;
   +	int	deprecated;
   +	int	home;
   +	int	temporary;
   +	int	device;
   +	int	scope;
   +	int	label;
   +	int	matchlen;
   +};
This is much larger than it needs to be.  Please replace these "int"
binary states with single "u32 flags;" and appropriate bit
definitions.
This structure sits on the stack, so it is important to be
as small as we can easily make it.
Otherwise I have no problems with the patch, Alexey?
