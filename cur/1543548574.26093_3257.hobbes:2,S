Take 2.2.15, set a buffer of 128mbyte (of course assume your mp3 is larger
than 128mbyte :) and then run in background `cp /dev/zero .` in the same
fs where your mp3 file out of cache is living. Then you'll see why a large
buffer is useless if there's none kind of I/O fair scheduling into the
elevator. Repeat the same test in 2.2.16 then.
The I/O latency Hans was taking about for the mp3 player, is the time it
takes for the buffer to become empty.

That's historic cruft, it's unrelated to controlling the elevator
algorithm per-task/per-file basis IMHO.
