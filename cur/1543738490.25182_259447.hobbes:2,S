Maybe this is useful too?
Started make on that test Makefile, and
% strace -p 31810
Process 31810 attached - interrupt to quit
wait4(-1073750280, NULL, 0, NULL)       = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
it then immediately proceeded to give the old 'no child processes.
Stop.' thing.
Strangely, the bug is experienced only sporadically when using make -j2
on a kbuild. Maybe that's just a coincidence.
