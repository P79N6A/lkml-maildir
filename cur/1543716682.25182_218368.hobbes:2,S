Hi Andrew
I will resend patch 6 and 7 for IA64 cpu hotplug. the cpu_present fix reworked to remove the
ARCH dependencies apparently didnt fit the smp boot sequence for i386. I must have moved the 
cpu_present_map fix to just before smp_init, but I added to sched_init which wasnt the right place
anyway, and the cpu_possible was not set for all cpu's at that time as it was too early for i386.
I will be resending just those 2 patches right after this mail, once my system can boot this time.
sorry for the trouble.
Cheers,
ashok
