Subject: obsolete modparam change busted.

Circa 2.6.10, the module loader started barfing if
modprobe.conf contained obsolete parameters.
However this change was broken, and if the modprobe.conf
has trailing whitespace, modules fail to load with the
following helpful message..
snd_intel8x0: Unknown parameter `'
This ends up screwing over people who upgrade from previously
working configurations, so we've been backing out that change
in Fedora for a while with the patch below.
It doesn't look like the right thing to do, but it has got
things working again at least. Probably we should just check
explicity for whitespace and ignore it somewhere else in
the module loader.  Rusty?
