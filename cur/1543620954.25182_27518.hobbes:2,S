I have already written code that sends a link state notification via
netlink socket, but still have to create the patches for 2.5, maybe
2.4ac and later 2.4. Just give me some more days, if you're working as a
software developer in your daily job, you are not always motivated to
run straight to your private computer afterworks, at least I am not ;-)
