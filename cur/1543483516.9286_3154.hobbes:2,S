No.
> 
> [2.] I use a Eicon.Diehl Diva 2.01 ISDN card. It's a ISA PnP card.
> In kernel 2.0.36 everything works fine. I put the io address at 0x260 and
> the IRQ at 11 with isapnp. That goes without problems.
> In the 2.2.x kernels (both 0 and 1 the same) I have the following problem:
Diva 2.01 is not supported in HiSax 2.8, which is in 2.2.X in the moment.
(In 2.0.36 is HiSax 3.1)
Please use the latest HiSax CVS snapshoot for 2.1 from
ftp.suse.com/pub/isdn4linux/v2.1/isdn-tar.gz
Read ftp.suse.com/pub/isdn4linux/README first.
You can use the same i4k-utils like under 2.0.36, but have to recompile it.
