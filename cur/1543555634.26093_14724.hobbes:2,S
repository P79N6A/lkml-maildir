I don't think so.  I cannot reproduce this oops on 2.4.0-test11 with
modutils 2.3.21, ppp 2.4.0.  modutils 2.3.19 should be compatible with
kernel 2.4.0-test11, the incompatibility is between modutils <= 2.3.15
and kernel 2.4.0-test11.
It was difficult to find the right area of code, my compile with
egcs-2.91.66 and -march=i686 gives quite different Assembler, so take
this analysis with a pinch of salt.  Is there any chance that you are
using the wrong compiler and/or compiler options?
The oops looks to be on line 102 of kmod.c
	for (i = 0; i < current->files->max_fds; i++ ) {
current->files is NULL.  That has nothing to do with modutils, rather
it points to an invalid or incomplete current context.
