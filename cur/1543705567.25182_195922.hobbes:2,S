$SUBJECT. The driver seems to be present in alsa-driver but not the
in-kernel version. Is it very new? Does it need to be converted? Is it 
deprecated in 2.6 in favor of a better driver? May I help out?
I've just recently found an Aureal Vortex 2 gathering dust and I'm
hoping to get around my onboard sound problem with it for the time
being.
For those on alsa-user replying, either reply back to linux-kernel or
me. 
Thanks,
