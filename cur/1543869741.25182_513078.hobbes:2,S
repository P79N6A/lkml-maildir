Some more results, using a larger number of processes and io depths. A
repeat of the tests from friday, with added depth 20000 for syslet and
libaio:
Engine          Depth   Processes       Bw (MiB/sec)
----------------------------------------------------
libaio            1         1            602
syslet            1         1            759
sync              1         1            776
libaio           32         1            832
syslet           32         1            898
libaio        20000         1            581
syslet        20000         1            609
syslet still on top. Measuring O_DIRECT reads (of 4kb size) on ramfs
with 100 processes each with a depth of 200, reading a per-process
private file of 10mb (need to fit in my ram...) 10 times each. IOW,
doing 10,000MiB of IO in total:
Engine          Depth   Processes       Bw (MiB/sec)
----------------------------------------------------
libaio           200       100            1488
syslet           200       100            1714
Results are stable to within approx +/- 10MiB/sec. The syslet case
completes a whole second faster than libaio (~6 vs ~7 seconds). Testing
was done with fio HEAD eb7c8ae27bc301b77490b3586dd5ccab7c95880a, and it
uses the v4 patch series.
Engine          Depth   Processes       Bw (MiB/sec)
----------------------------------------------------
libaio            200       100            1488
syslet            200       100            1714
sync              200       100            1843
