Well, this was just the example we used in the discussion I mentioned.
In this case you are right. But what about
#!/usr/bin/awk --posix -f
to enable expressions like [0-9]{1,2}. There are really usefull
parameters for awk, shells, ... you can't use easily in scripts (IIRC,
perl has to parse the shebang line on its own because of this - although
this is really not the job of an interpreter.)
The "\" part: Yes, there are not many examples, where you really need
this, because it's not that likely to have filenames or parameters
containing spaces. That's why I said, this part could get some
"#ifdef CONFIG_SHEBANG_ESCAPE" or could even be deleted from the patch.
Here, I'd like to know what people consider more important:
compatibility for old scripts with shebang lines containing backslashes
or the possibility to have file names or paramaters containing white
space characters.
