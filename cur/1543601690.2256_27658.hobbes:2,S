That is the only way we can get information.  We can twiddle this bit and
run memory performance tests on machines that aren't affected and
other stress tests on machines that are affected and see if we can see
if stability is impacted.
Additionaly the motherboards could be instrumented, and we could see
if there are any timing differences.
Of course VIA looking at what they have done and what that bit is
supposed to be is easiest as they have the schemantics of those
chips.  But there is not reason to be limited to just that approach.
