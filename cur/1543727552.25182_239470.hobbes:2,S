So the user interfaces should be adapted before? I think this is
simple and then the elimination of /dev/cpusets in favor of /rcfs is
just deletion of code plus a simbolic link. The classes and cpusets
are both directories. The files in cpusets are: 
 - cpus: list of CPUs in that cpuset
 - mems: list of Memory Nodes in that cpuset
 - cpu_exclusive flag: is cpu placement exclusive?
 - mem_exclusive flag: is memory placement exclusive?
 - tasks: list of tasks (by pid) attached to that cpuset
The files in a CKRM class directory:
 - stats   : statistics (not needed for cpusets)
 - shares  : could contain cpus, mems, cpu_exclusive, mem_exclusive
 - members : same as reading /dev/cpusets/.../tasks
 - target  : same as writing /dev/cpusets/.../tasks
Changing the "shares" would mean something like
  echo "cpus +6-10" > .../shares
Just an idea...

Erich
