	Hi, everyone.
	In 2.4.22 ACPI detects my bios as buggy, and because of that ALSA modules 
refuse to load. This was not the issue with 2.4.21. Everytheng else is 
working excellent and about 30-40% faster. I even get 10% frame rate 
improvemet for glxgears (in 2.4.21 about 1400 FPS, in 2.4.22 1560 FPS)
	When boot with acpi=off, everything works fine.
	My machine is:
MB:		GA-7VAXPUltra
CPU:	AMD AthlonXP 1700+
Video:	ATI Radeon 9000
	
	boot.msg, dmesg, lspci and config are attached. If anything else is needed, I 
will be more than glad to provide it.
