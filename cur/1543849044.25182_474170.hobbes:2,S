I am not very familiar with the powerpc code and what I got here is 
conjecture from various messages. It would help to get some clarification 
on what is going on with node 0 memory. Is there really no memory 
available from node 0 on bootup? Why is this? 
If this is the case then you already have had issues for long time with 
per node memory lists being contaminated on bootup.
Why would you attempt to boot linux on a memory node without 
memory?
