Hi Helge,
A. I do neither have enough skills to take up a maintainers role
B. Linus and Andrew are high-leveled informed about the whole structural problem, but they close their eyes, they simply do not want to see the necessity of a replacement.
That is at least my impression.

Neither nor: I do not livbe with persons like Chehab and others, no matter what the consequence is. To be truthful I would strategically prefare a vacuum at the price that the work isn't even done for months.
ONLY IF there is a personnel vacuum the necessity for others to volunteer will arise.
So if you want a real change you gotta first kick the reactionary dumb bastards off from their seats without any return ticket - without that there won't be any changes at all!
But the practice now is the typical "Sit out and do not react at all" behaviour as far as Chehab himself is concerned - Germans remember that reactionary gesture from the time when Hellmut Kohl was chancellor for 16 horrible years.....
So there will be no "soft" or "polite" solution at all, but only a harsh and rude one:
"Kick out the Jams!"
