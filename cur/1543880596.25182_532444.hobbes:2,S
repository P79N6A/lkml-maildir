You can certainly script it with -geometry. But it is the wrong application
for this matter, because you benchmark X more than glxgears itself. What would
be better is something like a line rotating 360 degrees and doing some short
stuff between each degree, so that X is not much sollicitated, but the CPU
would be spent more on the processes themselves.
Benchmarking interactions between X and multiple clients is a completely
different test IMHO. Glxgears is between those two, making it inappropriate
for scheduler tuning.

Willy
