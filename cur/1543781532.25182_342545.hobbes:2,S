This one in particular is non-optimal looking from C because the 
compiler misses the potential for rotation.  But, composing into 
temporaries and then issuing two writes to memory instead of multiple 
writes within the same word could actually get you a better cycle count, 
and that is something GCC just might be able to do :)
