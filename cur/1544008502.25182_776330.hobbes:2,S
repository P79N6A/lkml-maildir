There are already pgin/pgout value.

There are 2 reasons to put this under DEBUG
 1. This is not exported as this value under /proc by global VM management.
 2. Few people can explain what this really means. No documentation in
    Docunemtation/ directory. I can't add precise explanation by myself.
    As Kosaki wrote, this is for his debug, IMHO.
If you want to show this, please add above two first.
