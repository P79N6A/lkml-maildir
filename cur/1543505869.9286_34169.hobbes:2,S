I would like to suggest that the "pre" patches being issued for the
kernel be identified in the EXTRAVERSION field.  This will make it
easier for those who use them to keep their versions straight.  i.e.
EXTRAVERSION = pre4
in the top-level Makefile.
I know the argument that pre-patches are supposedly being proposed as
the next version, the assumption being that, barring the problems which
are always found, the pre-version will be released as is.  But that
never seems to happen, and as there are sometimes several iterations of
this, IMHO identifying them would be convenient.
