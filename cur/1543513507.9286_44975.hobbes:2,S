many experienced Linux users do get the cards if they here there
is an alpha driver for it or a WIP for it, cause they know they 
will be able to get it to work. hell I've done that

I am not talking a ratiung of this stinks or this is good, I am
talking more of this works this has mixed results.. a better
rating would be this card has problems here here and here, or
this card is known to work with many systems and blah blah. 
Like I bought an S3Virage video card a while back only because I
had heard that X had support for it, (a while back) and only
after a long tormenting search.. I did learn a little about
video cards, but it was more than I realy wanted to know...

Don't take this wrong, but I build it myself.. I don't know
about you... I bought my first computer and felt like I got
screwed royally. I actually expected one thing and when I got
it, it did not have what I wanted in it. Ever since I have built
my own. I'd rather buy off the web from certain shops. I am more
likely to buy from someplace that is willing to list or link
info about the product too, especially if they describe some of
the specs. There is one place that I know of that is good with
linking to the MB manufacturer site, there tech support is good,
and there email support is also good. They are even willing to
help a little with Linux, or atleast they helped me since I
bought some parts form them.

I have Solaris7.. last I checked they had some info on one of
there cdroms or something like that that did not say much. It
was basically a list.  The Linux hardware howto was more
informative, but it was last updated in March or May of this
year. Alot has changed since then, in terms of available and
usable hardware. Unfortuantely documentation is one of the
hardest thing to keep updated..
