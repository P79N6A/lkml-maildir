I have rebuilt gdb-6.6 on x86_64. Ok.
Also, it fix building directfb on ARM. ;)

It's bad idea. Taken from directfb:
#if HAVE_ASM_PAGE_H
#include <asm/page.h>
#else
#define PAGE_SIZE   sysconf( _SC_PAGESIZE )
#endif
Other application can use something like this. I think we should drop
empty headers.
