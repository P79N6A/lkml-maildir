2.6.0-test9, swsusp (the kernel one, not the 2.0alpha patch).
works very fine. as usual video playback with mplayer&co
had a problem, but starting another XFree86 and quiting it
solved that.
I was using pcmcia, a wireless lan card with hostap driver
(0.1.0, kernel patched for that), and did not stop anything
or remove any module. still everything works very fine.
also I was using X, did not switch to console before suspending,
and it worked fine. great!
For reference: it's a dell latitude c600 notebook.
If you have one of these, swsusp should work fine for you, too.
Regards, Andreas
