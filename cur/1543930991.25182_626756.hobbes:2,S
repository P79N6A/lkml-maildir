In that case, even arch/*/{mm,kernel}/kvm.c would work fine, as long as you
only want to support one hypervisor, or a small set of small files, there
is no need to have even have a virt directory.
However, if you want to have symmetry across the architectures, I think
arch/*/kvm/ works out best, along the lines of 
arch/*/{perfmon,crypto,xen,power}. Neither of these is particularly large,
but arch/* is typically not that crowded either.
