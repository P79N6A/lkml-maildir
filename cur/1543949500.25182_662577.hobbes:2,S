Do we really need to take the spin lock in the common case where
conf->pending_bio_list.head is NULL? If not, the above could be
optimized to the slightly faster and better readable
	struct bio *bio;
	if (!conf->pending_bio_list.head)
		return 0;
	spin_lock_irq(&conf->device_lock);
	bio = bio_list_get(&conf->pending_bio_list);
	...
	spin_unlock_irq(&conf->device_lock);
	return 1;

Any chance to avoid this code duplication?
