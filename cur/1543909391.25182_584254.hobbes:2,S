  I gave it a spin, and got quite a few troubles that appears related to
 the lpfc driver.  I don't know if these problems happened due to the
 recent update as the latest kernel I ran before was 2.6.20 (where I
 never saw problems like these).  First I see that something failed when
 the volumes on the SAN (on a Sun StorageTek 6140 / Engenio 3994) is
 registered, causing two errors errors such as:

  This apparantly resulted in dm-multipath missing four paths it's
 supposed to see (two paths to the standby controller x two volumes), so 
 I unmounted, flushed multipath maps, and removed the lpfc module.  Then
 I modprobed it again, which immediately resulted in the modprobe
 process getting killed and the following showing up in the dmesg:

  At this point I saw no paths and the module was supposedly in use, so
 I rebooted to recover - this time all paths came up correctly.  So I
 don't know if I can reproduce this reliably, but I'll be happy to try
 to help out further if necessary.
  I've attached the complete dmesg output gathered after the last crash.
 An interesting thing to note is the complete lack of I/O errors,
 usually the kernel log is flooded with these because the block devices
 representing paths to the passive controller fails most I/O commands,
 including things like the initial partition table read.  So even though
 there's only two of those -EEXIST messages, it was a total of four
 paths that I think the block layer never saw.
  Oh, and this is Ubuntu 6.06 (x86_64) running on an IBM xSeries HS21
 blade.
