But why is it interesting to have this information at boot time?  As a
user, I certainly don't care.  As a developer, I don't find it interesting
information.  Maybe the maintainer of this particular piece of code finds
it useful (Do you, Jens?), but does it need to be reported at boot time?
Perhaps it would be more useful to add some kind of reporting to
mm/mempool.c along the same lines as /proc/slabinfo so we can get the
dynamic information about pools at runtime rather than knowing their
initial state at boot time.
