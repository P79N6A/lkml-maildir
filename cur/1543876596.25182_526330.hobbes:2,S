Ahh, thank you very much.  But I have 7.0, supposedly fixed, sigh...  That 
did fix it, the dvd is burning as I type, again thanks.
???? Can I put this into rc.local so its global?  I guess I will just for 
effects.  Or is there an option in a make xconfig to reset this to a 
usable sized limit?, because I can see cups also having problems since I 
have its render cache set for 127 megs, which should also trigger this.
Seems like a 'what were they thinking moment' to me. :)
