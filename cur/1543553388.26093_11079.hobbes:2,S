Why does this improve the code?  It gets slower and uglier and more
difficult to maintain.
Why does this make the code more portable?  gcc is already highly
portable, and so it the kernel.  This too gains us nothing.
Removing gcc-isms without a pragmatic reason -- and no, ISO C compliancy
is not a pragmatic reason -- is silly, extra work for little or no
value.
