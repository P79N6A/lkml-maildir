Because a single read not only goes to just one disk, it is sent to
the disk with the lowest expected seek time for that request.  This
cuts average read time in half, on average.
(See drivers/md/raid1.c::read_balance().)

You didn't post any benchmarks showing results for single write to a
single disk.
