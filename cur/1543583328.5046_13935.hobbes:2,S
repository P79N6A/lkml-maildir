I don't know how to make my 3c575Ct works with Mandrake 7.2
When i start linux the network seems to be ok (ifconfig)
But the pc doesn't speak with the network.
I have the erreor message:
interrupt posted but not delivered -- IRQ blocked by another device ?
I change the irq with no result.
I try to start linux with "noapic" and no result.
This ethernet card works with Windows 95 on the same pc.
Do you have an idea ?
Thaks a lot
