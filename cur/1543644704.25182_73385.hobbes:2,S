Jeff, 
You know that every hardware vendor will clam it works well under
MicroSoft, so why does it fail under Linux.  This is the classic one-liner
we all have gotten.  The reality is closed software is used to hide all
the flaws and failures of made by the ASIC people.  I would love to shove
the brain dead asic designer of the original PIIX4 AB/EB off a cliff on
fire for being absolutely "stupid".  Sorry this is as nice an clean as I
can say this and not dust off the flame thrower.

Worse is getting a spec that says, "no work around".
When the reality is the OEM hardware vendor will not take ownership of 
their errors and disclose a good proper work-around.
