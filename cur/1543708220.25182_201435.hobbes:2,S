Actually, it's not.
1) The presence/absence of the read permission on a directory determines
	whether the user will be able to list the directory's contents.
2) The fs permission model is enforced by the kernel.  Trying to impose
	additional restrictions in userspace is fragile, futile and
	an incredibly stupid idea.
