These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity. 
It is configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.
Apply to 2.6.13

Split patches available.
Changes:
Added:
 +vm-swap_prefetch-2.patch
As mentioned many times already, this code prefetches ram that has been 
swapped out during idle periods. This is the latest version of the patch and 
is a config option.
 +sched-staircase12_tweak.patch
The interactivity tweak which was isolated to the developmental 2.6.13-ck1+ 
patch seemed not to bring problems with the changes bringing staircase up to 
v12 so it has been incorporated.
Cheers,
Con
