The C99ification is really ugly, because the tables end up more or less 
unreadable unlike the previous version.  I don't think it's a good 
idea to use values from the ROM unchecked (like you did with the length
for the checksum). In fact this checksum change looks quite dangerous on i386
because there is very likely a machine out somewhere with bogus
length bytes which explodes when you do an access after the video ROM.
Chipsets sometimes have interesting errata in these areas.
[that's probably more an issue on i386 than on x86-64, but it's better
to be safe than sorry]
The other changes look ok. If you send me a patch just for these 
I will apply it.
