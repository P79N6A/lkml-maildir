i have stuck your original patch into testing and nothing blew up so 
far. Due to the mm/ bits this is not for the scope of x86.git, but 
obviously it all looks good and is .26-worthy to me:

Venki, could you please send a full patch against -git that has 
everything from Hugh included, with an updated changelog, for 
Linus/Andrew to ack/apply?
