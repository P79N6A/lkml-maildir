Strangely enough, it seems to be one single, persistent page.

That might be it.  For now, I just change the GFP masks for vmalloc() so
that I don't have to deal with it, yet.  But, I certainly can see that
how this is a new user of highmem.
I did go around killing processes like mad to see if any of them still
had a hold of the pipe, but the shotgun approach didn't seem to help.

I'll put the warnings in, and see if anything comes up.
