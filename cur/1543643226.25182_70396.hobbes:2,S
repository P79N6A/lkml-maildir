It's not just directories as I understand it, it's also any file that's
locked or unlocked.
If we make userspace do it, we need an interface.  Is there

That's nice, so may be no need for a new flavor of invalidate_inode_pages
to write, but what I was really talking about is what should be done
after discovering it failed.
Another thing: we only care about pages that were in the mapping at the
time of the original invalidate attempt.  Coming back and invalidating
a bunch of pages that were already properly re-read from the server,
just to get those few we missed on the first attempt would be, in a 
word, horrible.
This one is harder than it first seems.  It's worth putting in the
effort to do the job correctly though.  The current arrangement is,
err, unreliable.
