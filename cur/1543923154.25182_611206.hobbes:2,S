If we need a new config for it.  CONFIG_IMMATURE is the closest I
can think of.
Horrible ABI damage like reassigning magic numbers won't happen.
Argument passing won't change (unless it is simply impossible).
However there are little details which might change.  Things like
error codes or the behavior in unlikely circumstances.  Bugs are
expected to exist and so we bug compatibility isn't expect to be
maintained.
The bottom line is that when things are new they are immature and
very rarely do they come out of the gate perfect.  That is something
we need to recognize and deal with.  We need to communicate this
to our users (distros and other developers) and we need to work
quickly to get the kinks out so that the code really is mature.
I'm not looking for excuses to mess up or do the wrong thing.
I just know that as an engineer getting it perfect out of the
gate isn't going to happen.  So I'm doing what I can to ask
people to ease into using something new.
