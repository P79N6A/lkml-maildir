My old code does something like this:
	major = (dev >> 32);
	minor = (dev & 0xffffffff);
	if (!major) {
		major = (dev >> 16);
		minor = (dev & 0xffff);
		if (!major) {
			major = (dev >> 8);
			minor = (dev & 0xff);
		}
	}
In other words: If the whole thing is 16-bit, there is an 8-8
split.  If the whole thing is 32-bit, there is a 16-16 split.
Etc.
This allows all the old device numbers to stay.
The present isofs code uses a similar algorithm.
In principle of course a device number is a structureless number,
but mknod needs it in two components, and ls lists it in two
components. Otherwise the partition does not play a role.
