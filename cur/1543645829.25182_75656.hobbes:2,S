I use the neofb on my laptop, using the following audio/graphics chip:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Neomagic Corporation [MagicMedia 256AV] 
(rev 12) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
        Subsystem: Dell Computer Corporation: Unknown device 0088
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
        Memory at f9000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=16M]
        Memory at fdc00000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4M]
        Memory at fdb00000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1M]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 1
When I shut down my system, it is the last message I get. It happens after 
everything has been unmounted. 
After this message the system is locked solid.
