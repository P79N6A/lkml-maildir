Patch below attempts to address these concerns.

Please stop your political agenda of subverting the open source nature of
Linux.   The average user SHOULD find it a scary to run modules
that don't conform to her choice of  OPEN SOURCE OPERATING SYSTEM.    
If the average user wanted to run closed source code she would have picked 
a closed source operating system right?  Lets not let closed source code sneak 
in without putting up big red flags for the user.   Lets make sure that the
USER IS NOT CONFUSED about the nature of the module they're loading.
