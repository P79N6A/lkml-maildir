I understand. Still, 2.6.15 has 1.0.10rc3 and current alsa "stable" does
not work out of the box with it (at least for some of the cards and in
my tests - hmmm, maybe this only happens when running with the -rt
patches?). 
There's one additional tiny patch needed in alsa 1.0.10 if you want
snd-rtctimer to be detected by configure and subsequently built under
2.6.15+:
