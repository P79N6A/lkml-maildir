First off:
There are many other users that poke direct in the kernel source also.
Secondly and more importantly:
Introducing kabi/ you will have a half solution where several users will
have to find their stuff in two places for a longer period.
kabi/ does not allow you to do it incrementally - it requires you to
move everything over from a start.
You may argue that you can just move over a little bit mroe than needed
but then we ruin the incremental approach.
