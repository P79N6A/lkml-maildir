I think you need multicast routing for that to work the way you want it 
to. Flooding multicast traffic between network segments is normally the 
task for multicast routers since you need a routing protocol to prevent 
loops etc. If you send the data on both packets a multicast router 
connected to the two networks would forward a copy each way resulting in 
two packets on both segments.
