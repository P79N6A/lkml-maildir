I unpacked and patched the pcHDTV-2.0 driver kit, but the make bails 
out with this:
/usr/src/pcHDTV-2.0/cx88-cards.c: In function `hauppauge_eeprom_dvb':
/usr/src/pcHDTV-2.0/cx88-cards.c:772: warning: control reaches end of 
non-void function
[...]
That one I may be able to fix, probably a braces error.
Then 10 lines or so later:

Header file error?
I'll go try the 1.6 patch now.
