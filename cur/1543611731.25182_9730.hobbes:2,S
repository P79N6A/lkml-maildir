Hi
what happenned with thread from 2.2 to 2.4?
I have some problems with threaded programs, working under 2.2 and no more 
under 2.4
The test program is short:
----
#include <stdlib.h>
void main() {
  char *t="1.0";
  double d=0;
  d=strtod(t,(char **)NULL);
}
---
this program compiled with "gcc -g -lpthread test.c" has strange behaviour. 
The problem only appear using gdb to see the value of d
In most case, the value returned by strtod under a 2.4 kernel is nan.
I say most, because some 2.4 kernels don't fail other this line.
I have done some test with differents distributions, and so differents 
version of kernel, gcc, gdb and libc.

When it was possible, for the computer with the bug, under an 2.4 kernel, 
I've recompiled a 2.2.20, and the bug has disappeared!
Does someone have an idea about that ?
