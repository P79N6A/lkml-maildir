You did not provide the exact command you are using..
The attached log of the output looks OK. And I did not find the
offending error.
I suspect that the syntax you use to divert output to a file is wrong,
because the above error happens when you execute:
make 2
Try to doublecheck how you invoke make, and check any relevant environment
variables.
