I wasn't going to reply to this since it's your call and I've had my 
say, but since several others have, let me throw out one more idea on 
the off chance you like it:
Stop doing the pre's on the next version! After 2.6.10 comes 2.6.10.1 
etc, which everyone can see are incremental changes to 2.6.10, and when 
you really mean it, then put out 2.6.11-rc1.
Did that strike a nerve?
