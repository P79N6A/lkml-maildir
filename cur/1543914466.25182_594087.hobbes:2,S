Its different since it becomes a privileged player that can suck all 
the available memory out of the page allocator.

How are dirty file backed pages different? They may also be written out 
by the VM during reclaim.

But it seems that you have unbounded allocations with PF_MEMALLOC now for 
the networking case? So networking can exhaust all reserves?

That sounds good.
