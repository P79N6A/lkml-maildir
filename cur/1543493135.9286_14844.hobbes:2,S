OK.  Most of the important points have been covered already.  Especially
the tuning of the apache server itself is one of the most significant
issues.

No advice right now: these should be OK out of the box.
However, having said that, there is a group of people working quite hard
to optimise the kernel fairly aggressively for large server loads like
this.  It's not necessarily something you want to get involved with if
you just want to take a fair benchmark of the existing kernels, but if
you really want to get the best out of a large memory machine then it
may be worthwhile looking up the scalability work being done at

In particular we've been working on bottlenecks in the page, buffer and
dentry hashing mechanisms and have found fairly impressive performance
gains to be had by tuning that.  Updates will be posted as we come up
with tested patches.
Cheers,
 Stephen.
