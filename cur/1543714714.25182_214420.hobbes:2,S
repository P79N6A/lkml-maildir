David,
Is there a big user demand for copy-on-write support for hugetlb pages?
I can understand the rationale for making hugetlb pages behave more like user 
pages, and fixing the problem that hugetlb pages are shared across fork via 
MAP_SHARE semantics regardless of whether the user requests MAP_PRIVATE or 
not, but it just doesn't strike me as something that anyone who uses hugetlb 
pages would actually want.
Of course, YRMV (your requirements may vary).  :-)
