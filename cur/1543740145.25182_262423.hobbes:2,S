DMA doesn't need the kernel's help except for when you want to manage
security - DRI is quite special in that way. A driver to provide
mmapable DMA memory is trivial. IRQ's are *much* harder because you have
to clear the IRQ source in the IRQ handler, but people have code that
does this and then sends signals.
