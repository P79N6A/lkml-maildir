Hi Christoph,
I cannot make something to be, something that it is not.
That is, the SAS LLDD is not a "scsi host" and it will never be,
because it is just not a "scsi host".
What it is, is an access point to the transport, this is its
sole function and existance.  E.g. it doesn't know about max_luns,
etc, which are purely SCSI Core-into-scsi_host concepts.
It does know about Execute Command SCSI RPC and TMFs.
The "scsi_host" template is a SCSI Core concept, which
mixes a software component (what it is) and a hardware component
(what you're talking about).
Now, see the layering infrastructure: SATA support:
The sas_sata_host.c file would also declare a scsi_host, where
it will define its own queuecommand(), eh_timed_out(),
eh_strategy_handler(), etc. and do the _protocol_ part,
whereby the SAS LLDD does the transport part.
