Well, apart from the installation case, simply using such kernel is easy
enough, if you use an initrd. The mkinitrd script only has to be aware of
this, and include the needed firmware in the initrd, as it does for the
modules. Initial installation will have to either have the possibility to
build custom initrds with the firmware blobs in it, or a way to easily get
those firmware blobs (from CD, floppy, net, ...), or have support for a second
initrd which would contain the firmware. I don't believe there is already
support for a second ramdisk in todays kernel.
