Subject: Writing as init without /dev/console?

Hello!
Currently I do not open /dev/console in cinit, but currently
I do see very strange behaviour:
If the first printf() in the following code (from serv/cinit.c) is
enabled, the socket communication will later fail:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
#ifdef DEBUG
//   printf("ARGC=%d\n",argc);
#endif
   set_signals(ACT_SERV);  /* set signal handlers */
#ifdef DEBUG
   printf("ARGC=%d\n",argc);
#endif
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know what could be the relation between this printf and the
behaviour that cinit-0.1 later hangs in comm/do_result when reading
the resulting byte from a socket.
If you want to see the full code, it can be found at [0].
This code contains serv/cinit.c, which is the same as found
in cinit-0.0.8 [1] and serv/cinit.c-cinit0.1, which is the one
with a bit more debugging and the printf() before set_signals,
which makes cinit hang in comm/do_result at the position when
fpoint() is called.
Perhaps this is an issue with not opening /dev/console? It's just
a guess, because I don't have any idea what could cause this behaviour.
If someone has _any_ idea, I would be very thankful.
Nico
