Hello everyone,
Whenever I meet intractable troubles, I will come here.and now the questions is follow:
I connect to linux box with ttyS0.
Sometimes,such as press Ctrl+C constantly, my linux console can't display output exactly.if using commond such as "ls",the linux box can't display output continuously,unless you press enter key.I think this mayby relate with "agetty,login,/dev/console" etc. 
How to resolve this trouble?
THANKS
:)
