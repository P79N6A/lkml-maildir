If Linus made // special in the kernel we'd have to make it unspecial again
in glibc 8(. It also breaks the flexibility of mounting we have now. Why
is it //ipc - what does //ipc have to do with ipc in other languages, why
can't I mount it where I want it ?
We have a nice unix VFS abstraction. Not using it is just ugly. Things like
mounting /ipc can be handled in startup space quite easily.
