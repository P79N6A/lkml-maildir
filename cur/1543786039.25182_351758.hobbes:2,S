I think we need something more like this ...
include/linux/notifier.h:
+static inline int notifier_call_chain(struct notifier_block **n,
+					unsigned long val, void *v)
+{
+	if (n)
+		return __notifier_call_chain(n, val, v);
+	return NOTIFY_DONE;
+}
kernel/sys.c:
-int notifier_call_chain(struct notifier_block **n, unsigned long val, void *v)
+int __notifier_call_chain(struct notifier_block **n, unsigned long val, void *v)
-EXPORT_SYMBOL(notifier_call_chain);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(__notifier_call_chain);
That way everyone gets both the quick test and the global size reduction.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
