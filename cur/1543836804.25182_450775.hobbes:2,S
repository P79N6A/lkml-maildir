Just as mentioned before - we shouldn't add endless special cases to the code that interprets the unwind
information, but rather fix the unwind information so that it properly reflect the actual state. Like in the
other case, the piece of code should be properly annotated, which would require it to be moved into
an assembly file (it escapes me why code like that was ever placed in a C file).
