One thing to be aware of on 2.2.X is that the off_t parameter passed to
the underlying file systems in the VFS is an 'signed long' so that even
with this patch, if you attempt to copy the file onto some of the
filesystems in linux, they will still enforce this 2GB limit (since
read() and write() in the VFS have it defined this way -- may be
implementation specific only to certain file system drivers on Linux.)
