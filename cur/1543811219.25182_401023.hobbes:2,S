I guess you mean undefined.

It's still totally unclear how you can write portable write combining code.
I think the basic idea is weird. You're basically writing something
that doesn't follow the normal MMIO rules of Linux drivers and you're 
trying to do this portable, which won't work anyways because 
there is no portable way to do this.
Before we can add such a macro I suspect you would first 
need to provide some spec how that "portable write combining"
is supposed to work and get feedback from the other architectures.
Or keep it in architecture specific code, then the generic macro
isn't needed.
