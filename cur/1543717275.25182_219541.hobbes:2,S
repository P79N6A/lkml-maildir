This should be fine. Earlier d_bucket check was done before "continue" as the 
lookup used to loop infinetly. The reason for infinite looping was that lookup 
going to a different hash bucket due to concurrent d_move and not finding
the list head from where it started.
After introduction of hlist, there is less chance of lookup looping
infinitely even if it is moved to a different hash bucket as hlist ends with 
NULL.
But I still see theoritical possibilty of increased looping. Double rename can 
keep putting lookup back at the head of hash chain and hlist end is never seen.
