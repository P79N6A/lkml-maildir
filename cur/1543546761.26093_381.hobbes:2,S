I am trying to use the linux-2.4.0-test7 kernel
I have an eepro100 network card and when configuring it the system
freezes:
This is when doing:
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.5 broadcast 192.168.1.255 netmask
255.255.255.0
It did work with earlier beta kernels ( I do not recall which was the
last one but  I am quite certain that at least test1 did)
(It works ok with 2.2.16 on which this is being written)

Here is the setup:
gcc -version
gcc sv Reading specs from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.95.2/specs gcc version 2.95.2

/sbin/tune2fs --version

insmod -V  2>&1 |grep version
insmod version 2.3.15
pppd --version
pppd version 2.4.0b4
I also tried installing  net-tools-1.57  (which did not change the
situation )
This is the output of lspci -v
