No.  BIND was has been busted between 2.4 and 2.6.  Not to mention the 
whole libc -> glib switchover.
It's hilarious that BSD had to create a Linux app compat lib, and the 
RedHat shipped compat libs for 3 releases
as well.   Not even close.  Windows has won.  M$ has won.  Linux lost 
the desktop wars and will soon loose
the server wars as well.   The reason - infighting and lack of backwards 
compatibility.  Binary only module
breakage kernel to kernel will continue.
