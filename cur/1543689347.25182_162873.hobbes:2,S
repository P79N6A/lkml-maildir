I talked to Jeff and Andrea about this at KS & OLS this year ... the feeling
was that UML was too much overhead, but there were various ways to reduce
that, especially if the underlying OS had UML support (doesn't require it
right now).
I'd really like to see the performance proved to be better before basing
a design on UML, though that was my first instinct of how to do it ...
