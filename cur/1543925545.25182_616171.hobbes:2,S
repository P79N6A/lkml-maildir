They are such magic registers, though of various grades.
Some are part of the CPU core and affect things like CPU core itself, CPU
caches, MMU/TLB and exceptions/interrupts.  Others are on-silicon devices such
as the serial ports, the bus controller, the SDRAM controller.

Using memory barriers ought to be good enough for the ring buffer.  There
aren't actually any atomic ops available other than bit-set and bit-clear.
