Well, there is a problem in the code which is clearly visible just by
inspection: that it is touching a pci device without having called
pci_enable_device on it.  That is well known to cause problems on many
platforms, and it is not guaranteed to work on any platform.
With a clearly visible bug like that in there, it doesn't matter what
platform(s) the problem is reported on.
Paul.
