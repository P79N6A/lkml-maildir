Agreed.

I don't think this is true. Loading the firmware on the first
"ifconfig up" is problematic. Often, people want to rename the
device from ethX/wlanX/... to something stable. This is usually
based on the adapter's MAC address, which is not visible until
the firmware is loaded.
Prism54 does it this way and it really sucks. You need to bring
the adapter up to load the firmware, then bring it back down,
rename it, and bring it up again.
Denis: any plans for this to be fixed?
I agree that drivers should initialize the adapter in the OFF
state, but the firmware needs to be loaded earlier than the
first ifconfig up.
How about loading the firmware when the first ioctl touches the
device? This way, it would get loaded just before the MAC address
is retrieved.
