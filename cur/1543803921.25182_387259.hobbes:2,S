Absolutely not.  The more spindles the more chances of a double failure. 
Simple statistics will mean that unless you have mirrors the more drives 
you add the more chance of two of them (really) failing at once and choking 
the whole system.
That said, there very well could be (are?) cases where md needs to do a 
better job of handling the world unravelling.
