Doh, of course the above is what it actually does.

I did a bit of visual grep for counterinstances of c) in core code but
nothing jumped out at me. I'm pretty sure the former is more common

of cast operators. Thing is, indent feels obliged to force it one way
or the other, so I think it should err on the no space side.
