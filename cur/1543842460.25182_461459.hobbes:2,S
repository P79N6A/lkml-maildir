Perhaps, but it should not be up to the versionning system to decide to
change the contents of the patches which get merged. Otherwise, we will
not be able to trust it as much as today.

perhaps for this case, but then what will prevent us from trying to
implement dirtier features such as line un-wrapping ?

except if the text version is mangled in order not to be detected as
a patch. I suspect that inserting a space in front of "---" is enough
for patch not to find it. Don't get me wrong, I know this is dirty.
But as long as some people will use broken mailers, we'll get broken
patches. Some people occasionnaly switch to attachments stating they
have broken mailers, and others even post links to their patches,
which is annoying for potential reviewers. If we could give them
strict rules on how to proceed when they have such problems, it would
make the job easier for others.
