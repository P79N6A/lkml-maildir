| 
| Running this the first time would always segfault and trying
| a second time would consistently panic the system.
| 
| We traced the segfault to sg_ioctl trying to do something.
| After finding a vague hint with google I tried to boot with
| mem=512M (The machine has 2GB of memory) and voila:
| The update worked without any crashes.
| We don't know yet if the firmware update fixed the original problem,
| but the conclusion is:
| 
| sg_ioctl seems to address illegal parts of memory when used with
| kernels where highmem is enabled.
| 
| Any sg-driver maintainers out there?
