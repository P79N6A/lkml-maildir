I agree that a loop is needed.  And yes someone didn't do a very
good job of designing this interface.
I posted a piece of code that gets a usable upper bound on cpumask_t
size, suitable for application code to size mask buffers to be used
in these system calls.
See the lkml article:

Or search in google groups for "cpumasksz".

    [PATCH] cpumask 5/10 rewrite cpumask.h - single bitmap based implementation
Feel free to steal it, or to ignore it, if you find it easier to
write your version than to read mine.
