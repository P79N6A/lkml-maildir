 Hmm, I recall I implemented and explicitly verified switching the
/proc/cpuinfo "tsc" flag (as well as the userland access to the TSC) off
when I wrote the code to handle the "notsc" option.  Has it changed since
then?  I recall you modified the code a bit -- I looked at the changes
then but I was pretty confident the semantics was preserved.
 There is no possibility to have TSC and non-TSC chips mixed in a single
SMP system (due to existing hardware, even though it's possible in
theory), so there is no problem with such an assymetry.  Either all chips
have the "tsc" flag in /proc/cpuinfo on or off.
