Greetings Alexander,
I am not sure if you have seen the recent discussion on linux-kernel about
Ooopses in kmem_cache_alloc() which may suggest that there are users of
getname() before names_cachep is created (due to module_init nature of
namecache_init()). 
Have you given this some thought? I may be missing something obvious
(e.g. you may have proved a theorem that _no_ getname() user is possible
in principle before do_initcalls() is invoked?).
Regards,
Tigran
