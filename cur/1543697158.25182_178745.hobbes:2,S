Finally got it working again.  Disabling preempt didn't seem to fix anything, 
but I've left it off for now anyway.  Module unload support also wasn't 
selected, and that could have been causing problems too.  (It certainly 
confused cardbus and my shutdown scripts...)
The actual save part was slow because DMA was off (I had generic dma on, but 
on a laptop with an ALI M5229 IDE controller you need to enable ALI M15x9 
DMA.  Right.)  Writing out pages is AMAZINGLY slow in PIO mode, by the way.  
5 minutes vs 5 seconds kind of slow...
It then saved happily but didn't resume because I hadn't told it the default 
resume partition was /dev/hda2.  (I don't have to specify which partition to 
save to, why do I have to specify which one to resume from?  Oh well...)
And lo, I hath once again resumed!  (My copy of the suspend code still has a 
large number of printk statements in it, but at the moment I consider that a 
GOOD thing.)
On another note, here's a panic I managed to save when one of the suspend 
attempts decided to go "boing", yet dumped me back to a console that sort of 
worked for a bit until I tried to shutdown, where it hung shutting down 
pcmcia.  (Amazingly, it didn't seem to eat my filesystem when I sent dmesg to 
a file.  Go figure.)
I don't believe this has anything to do with the prink statements or config 
tweaks I was doing, this is one of those intermittent panics I mentioned 
earlier where it tries to save and bits wind up on the floor.  This is from a 
system that, right after it booted, I immediately logged in (text console 1) 
and ran my suspend script, which got as far as "sync; echo -n disk > 
/sys/power/state" and panicked trying to stop all the tasks.  X had not run.
Let me know if there's something more recent I should try...
