I am running 2.6.11-rc2+ fix for the pipe related leak by Linus. I am 
currently running a QT+KDE compile with distcc on two machines.  I am 
running these machines for around 11 hours now and  swap seems to be 
growing steadily on the -rc2 box - it went to ~260kb after 10hrs, after 
which I ran swapoff.  Now after couple hours it is at 40kb. The other 
machine is Knoppix 2.4.26 kernel with lesser memory and it hasn't run 
into swap at all.
On the -rc2 machine, however, I don't feel anything is sluggish yet. But 
I think if I leave it running long enough it might run out of memory.
I don't know if this is perfectly normal given the differences between 
2.4.x and 2.6.x VM. I will  keep it running and under load for a while 
and report any interesting stuff.
Here is /proc/meminfo on the rc2 box as of now -
