That will certainly be the case in some scenarios.  It seems
useful for the mutex user to have a means to advice of the
anticipated usage (hold time).
The other [perhaps additional] means of adaptation would be
Solaris-style where a failed mutex acquisition attempt would
spin rather than block the caller if the mutex owner is
currently running on some other cpu.  The rationale being the
spin wait time is less overhead compared with two context
switches.  Though I'd expect this ideal has been batted around
here before.
