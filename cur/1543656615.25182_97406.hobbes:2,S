Could be.  The default timeslice was around 50ms in 2.4.  The default in
2.5 with a min of 10 and a max of 300 is about 100ms.
It could be that without the priority boost, 100ms is too long and
capable of starving tasks (which, without the priority boost, are all at
the same level and thus scheduled round-robin).
