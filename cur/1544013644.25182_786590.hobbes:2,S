This is all very nice, but messages like this are not going to help 
anything. If those guys want to get code into the mainline kernel then 
the path for that is the same as for anybody else: concrete, 
step-by-step improvements (i.e. patches) that do not duplicate 
functionality that is already present in the kernel, actually belong in 
the kernel as opposed to userspace, and do not create an undue 
maintenance burden. If such patches were submitted they would 
potentially be accepted. Question is why the grsecurity guys haven't 
done this well before now, as opposed to now when they seem to be in 
crisis mode.
Saying to the kernel developers "here, throw this huge blob of code into 
your kernel because otherwise we're taking our ball and going home" is 
not how it works.
