i had this happen too with pre9. I was grep'ing (more file | grep string)
a 200 meg file on the console, then my tech started reading the same file
over nfs and all the mores and greps froze 'D'. I too was forced to
alt-sysrq-b. Can anyone tell me why I saw like 6 mores and greps (apiece)
in the 'ps' listing? when i only ran the command once
