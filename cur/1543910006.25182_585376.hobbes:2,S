Beats the crap out of me.
Drop this patch - it looks like it might just be papering over
symptoms rather than fixing the real problem - see below.
What I do know is that current UML doesn't run when built on a SuSE
host, the UML commit which caused it to break is
c35e584c087381aaa5f1ed40a28b978535c18fb2 
	
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=c35e584c087381aaa5f1ed40a28b978535c18fb2;hp=a5bd1786fb30abe663b904f6d79bba413e9ba883
and the difference between a working UML binary and a broken one is
this:
+  1 .note.ABI-tag 00000020  0000000060000254  0000000060000254  00000254  2**2
+                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, DATA
+  2 .note.SuSE    00000018  0000000060000274  0000000060000274  00000274  2**2
+                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, DATA
and the .note.SuSE section makes the difference.
Looking into it a bit further, the contents of the section are:
	objdump --section=.note.SuSE -s uml8796-linux-good
	uml8796-linux-good:     file format elf64-x86-64
	Contents of section .note.SuSE:
	 60000274 05000000 04000000 53755345 53755345  ........SuSESuSE
	 60000284 00000000 01000a02                    ........        
which seems kind of pointless, but also harmless.
The crash is in this section:
  __uml_setup_start = .;
  .uml.setup.init : { *(.uml.setup.init) }
  __uml_setup_end = .;
with &__uml_setup_start being 8 bytes before the start of the first
16-byte structure in .uml.setup.init, so the structures are misaligned
wrt the start symbol.
I don't see any connection between the presence of a section at the
start of the binary and this misalignment, so the patch is probably wrong.
