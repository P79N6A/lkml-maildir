Absolutely and utterly impossible - with over 100 different machine
types I don't have anything approaching the necessary knowledge to
_special_ _case_ those platforms which _might_ be able to survive
without the DMA zone.  And that's what it'll be - a set of special
cases in the initialisation path.
As I've tried to explain, from day 1 of the multi-zone Linux MM, it's
always made more sense to put everything into zone DMA and (eventually)
hope that the normal and highmem zones eventually go away.
Who cares what happens to __GFP_DMA - it's irrelevant, since both
__GFP_DMA and non-_GFP_DMA allocations will come from the DMA zone
when the normal zone is empty.  Where the normal zone is _never_
populated with any memory, defining __GFP_DMA to zero will have no
effect.
So, let me repeat: it makes much much much more sense to get rid of
__GFP_DMA _and_ the normal and highmem zones than it does to get rid
of the DMA zone.
