I personally don't consider that maintainers have a right to demand
CC's. Sure it's polite and good to CC them, but that's not the same as
having the right to demand this.
However I do think that the "top level" mailinglists deserve one. Eg if
you're unsure, linux-kernel. if you know it's ide, linux-ide etc etc.
