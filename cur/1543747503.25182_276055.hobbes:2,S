Ok, I rebuilt 2.6.9 with CONFIG_PREEMPT=n and telnet failed
the one time I tried it.
Then I built with CONFIG_PREEMPT=n and CONFIG=SMP=n and
the first telnet attempt succeeded.  I then tried six
more telnet attempts, two of those failed and the rest
succeeded.
Since my earlier testing usually was of only 1 (sometimes
2) telnet attempts per boot, they too may have had some
ratio of success/failure other than 100% or 0%.
