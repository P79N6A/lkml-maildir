Me thinks, fat is pretty robust, and with the small window it improves,
because most users will wait until the operation finished and unplug then.
Which is enough delay for scheduled sync, but not for delayed flushed blocks.

Hmm... Actually a "better" solution which involves a journalling filesystem
is not an option for most fat users becaue they need the interoperability.
So the only real solutions you have (beside educating the user to wait for
sync) is to make the corruption window smaller and perhaps do some
reordering on meta data changed to lower the dangers of corruptions.

You mean, to build sync writes at the right places in the fatfs? I guess yes
that would be even better, so you have kind of soft updates for fat :)
However dont know how reliable the flash controllers are with reordering (if
they are somewhat smart)
How about having configurable sync intervalls per fs/device and default them
to 0 for removeable media?
