Yes, I know. I'm not arguing about the right location for lvm. But lvm has
been moved from drivers/block/Makefile to drivers/md/Makefile, so lvm.c
has to follow. (Or Makefile has to be changed again)
If lvm is in drivers/md or in drivers/lvm is a matter of taste. drivers/lvm
is more logical, but having another directory for only two source files? 
Putting it in the same directory as md is not too bad, because both do similar
things: They take existing block devices and somehow combine them to a bigger 
one. 
Put it wherever you want. I just don't care. But make it work. ;-)
