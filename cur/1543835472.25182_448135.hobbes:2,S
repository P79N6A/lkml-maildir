Yes, it will definitely be submitted once stable. We're still tweaking
some stuff, such as whitelisting (see "[PATCH] DMI: Decode and save
OEM String information").
BTW, I'll rename the modules to "thinkpad_ec" for basic EC functions
(also used by the patched hdaps), and probably "thinkpad_battery" or
"thinkpad_hwmon" for the rest. Not sure about the latter: we happen to
be doing only battery stuff at the moment but this is likely to change
in the future.
Is "hwmon" suitable for something that *contols* battery charging too,
and might have extra attributes tacked on as we unravel additional
ThinkPad firmware capabilities?
