Found something interesting. Having Wakeup latency timing turned on
makes a HUGE difference. I turned it off and recompiled and now I am
seeing numbers back in line with what I expected from 2.6.16-rt4. Sorry,
but I had no idea it would make that much difference. I don't have a
complete run yet, but I have seen enough to know that I am not seeing
tons of missed interrupts and the highest reported latency thus far is
61 usec.
