Before LZO code is sent to Linus, its selection in Kconfig should be  
made orthogonal to the current zlib selection code.
This means:
1) Options in lib/Kconfig hidden (selectable by drivers as required)
2) Decompression and Compression support separated, as read-only  
filesystems only need to build in decompression support.
Thanks,
Michael-Luke
