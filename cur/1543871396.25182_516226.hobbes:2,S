Yes I saw this. I should write more words next time :)
Full explanation:
----------------------
If your tunable is named "accurate_timestamps" then a 0 value would mean :
Use a low precision timestamp (based on xtime for example) instead of a full 
resolution...
This is not what your patch does (while it could do that, but beware that 
net-2.6.22 includes now a ktime_t timestamping)
So :
------
It would be better to name the tunable "disable_timestamps", default 0 of 
course.... 
It would better describe what your patch is actually doing : Even if a tcpdump 
is running (so asking for timestamps), it wont have them because the sysctl 
disabled them.
Thank you
