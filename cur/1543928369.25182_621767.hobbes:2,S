Uniformity for the sake of code size reduction and easier maintenance. 
Yes I think it would be great to have this feature on all arches if 
possible. If someone could work with the gcc /linker folks to get this 
done that would be great.
But the feature has been removed from gcc and so its not usable for IA64 
with a current compiler anymore. This is basically removing useless code.
