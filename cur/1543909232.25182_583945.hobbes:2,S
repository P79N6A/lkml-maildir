To be totally fair, there shouldn't be a problem with spurrious
re-sends, I'm not sure what problems some chipsets are having there,
though it may be related to the method used for re-sending. On ppc, we
use the soft method I think everywhere anyway.
I use re-sending on cell with fasteoi for the on-die top-level PIC
because while it does have a HW priority handling, it also doesn't have
a HW mask. Thus I just "drop" IRQs that are masked and resend (it's edge
messages).
