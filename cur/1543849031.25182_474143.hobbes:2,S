The full set of feature enhancements for Linux was to also provide "inode 
numnbers" in vanilla ISO-9660 mode and to add a fingerprint into the image so 
that the kernel is able to detect this.
Implementing support for the new inode features is supporting this mkisofs 
fingerprint as well as full testing and modifying the inode cache and NFS 
export code. For Solaris I am ready now and the code will appear soon in an 
official OpenSolaris source......
