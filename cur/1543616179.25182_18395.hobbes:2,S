If they did I suspect it would be minimal.  Andrew's point on complexity
and overhead in this manner is exact -- such thinks are just not an
issue.
I see two valid arguments against kernel preemption, and I'll be the
first to admit them:
- we introduce new problems with kernel programming.  specifically, the
issue with implicitly locked per-CPU data.  honestly, this isn't a huge
deal.  I've been working on preempt-kernel for awhile now and the
problems we have found and fixed are minimal.  admittedly, however,
especially wrt the future, preempt-kernel may introduce new concerns.  I
say let's rise to meet them.
- we don't do enough for the worst-case latency.  this is where future
work is useful and where preempt-kernel provides the framework for a
better kernel.
I want a better kernel.  Hell, I want the best kernel.  In my opinion,
one factor of that is having a preemptible kernel.
