Hmmm.  looks like raid0_mergeable_bvec is simply wrong,
(in my defense, I re-wrote it before having seen the caller...)
Below is a patch that might fix it (key part is removing addition
of biovec->bv_len, rest is changing 'K' to more sensible 'sectors'.
Jens:  It looks like the biovec arg to  ->merge_bvec_fn is
un-necessary.  Is that right or am I missing something?
