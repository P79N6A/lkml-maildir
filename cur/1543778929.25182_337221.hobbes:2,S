() parentheses (short form: parens)
[] square brackets
{} braces
<> dunno their name :p

Why this? if(a) {} is not any worse than if (a). I would make this an option.

No unnecessary parentheses:
   return (3 + 7) * 5;
   return 1;
instead of
   return ((3 + 7) * 5);
   return (1);

Would it be reasonable to say that the first column can be a space?
Some editors (e.g. joe) list the function in some status bar and do that based 
on the fact that all C code in a function is indented, and only the function 
header is non-indented. Putting a label statement fools the algorithm.
joe-bug or option for freedom?

switch(foo) {
default: {
	int somevar = dosomething;
	break;
}
}
What now? You've got two }} after another.
