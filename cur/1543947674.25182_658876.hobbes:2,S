All right.  You'll need to enlarge your big reversal patch by reverting 
commit 4145ed6dc597a9bea5f6ae8c574653b2de10620f.

On further checking the answer turns out to be sched_show_task().  
That's the routine which gets called for each process when you type 
Alt-SysRq-t.

The fact remains that it is unsafe to register a device during a sleep 
transition, although if the device's driver doesn't have a suspend or 
resume method you can probably get away with it.

It happened in a workqueue.  There could be lots of similar cases: Some 
interrupt-driven event causes a hotplug action.  Since the action can't 
be carried out in interrupt context, the driver has no choice but to 
defer it to a workqueue or kernel thread.  Blocking that workqueue or 
kernel thread won't cause a problem _unless_ the driver's 
suspend/resume methods try to synchronize with it.  That's the 
difficult case.

Exactly.

At this point the driver core owns the device semaphore, so the 
unregistration task will block until the sleep is over.  If the 
driver's resume method has to synchronize with the unregistration task 
then it will deadlock.  I agree, it would be a design issue.  In fact, 
it's the same design issue described earlier in this email.

That warning was just for debugging purposes.  A timer in the resume
path could do the same thing with fewer false alarms, just like the 
timer in the suspend path.  I have added it to the new patch.

Yes, you're right.  It's fixed in the new version.

Okay.
You know, with this new patch we probably don't need 
device_pm_schedule_removal() any more.  However I have left it in for 
now.

Certainly!
Here's the new version.  Zdenek, could you try it out with none of 
Rafael's patches installed?
