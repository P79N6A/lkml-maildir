Anyone else seeing this?  With kernel version 2.5.1, I get several
instances of 
	sr: unaligned transfer
followed by
	Unable to identify CD-ROM format.
whenever I try to mount a CD-ROM.  This is something new with 2.5.1
(probably the new bio code), as all prior kernel versions (non-pre)
work fine.  SCSI driver is aic7xxx.
