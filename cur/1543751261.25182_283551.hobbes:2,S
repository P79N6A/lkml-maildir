Hello,
             I have two machines with RedHat linux 9
with serially connected to each other. While doing
some kernel programming i am getting frequently Oops
messages. I am learning network stack. How can i
capture those oops message and which utility can help
me to solve oops problem. I heard about lkcd which is
on lkcd.sourceforge.net. Can it be suitable utility to
check kernel crash dump. I have yet not used it and
require advice from kernel developers.
Please kindly help me.
Thanks in advance.
regards,
cranium
