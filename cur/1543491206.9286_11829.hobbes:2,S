Hello,
I have set up a new tree that will host ncr/sym53c8xx driver patches.
Basically, in a couple of weeks, I will only support this driver bundle
against 2.0.36, latest 2.0.37-pre and latest 2.2.x, even if this bundle
will not be yet included into current kernel trees. 
The fact that this bundle is not or not yet included into current kernel
trees is not my choice, but the one of kernel maintainers that I respect
obviously.
I invite people, that have currently problems they think may be due to the
driver, to upgrade to the latest drivers version prior to report me their
problem. For problem that occurs under 2.2.X kernel, checking if the
problem also occurs under 2.0.36/37 or not, when it is possible, is very
important for having some first idea about the real cause of the problem.
I donnot mean that I will state as 'not driver related' un problem that
does not occur under 2.0.36/37, but just that it is _very_ _helpful_ for
me to know how behaves 2.0.36/37 when 2.2.X fails using same or very
similar driver version. 
You will help me by looking into the new tree and let me know if something
is wrong, not clear enough or just missing.
The new tree is currently under construction and I apologize in advance if 
something is still wrong or unclear. I will test it myself, as a user, as
soon as I will have time for, and complete the README files that, for now, 
are very minimal.
