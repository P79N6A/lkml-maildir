I'm doing a fair bit of raw network programming and
I find it very annoying to have to do all the testing
as root. Now, I figure I could give my user 
CAP_NET_RAW and CAP_NET_ADMIN but this is tricky.
For starters, any call to set*id() will clear the
bits if you're not root. This can be disabled
but then (i guess) login won't drop all the caps.
Then I figured CAP_SETPCAP to set it afterwards,
but it seems that not even init has this cap set.
How is this going to work?
Any ideas?
