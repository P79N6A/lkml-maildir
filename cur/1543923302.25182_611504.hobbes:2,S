Think about about the values being exported by these sysfs attributes: 
they indicate whether or not that feature is supported.
Thus, using the presence/absence of an attribute to communicate the same 
thing would be redundant.
This suggestion adds a whole lot of complexity -- mirroring every change 
to sdev->supported_events by dynamically adding or removing attributes.
The current nice, simple, elegant bitops-based interface is suddenly a 
lot more cumbersome if forced to deal with attribute creation and disposal.
Finally, this additional complexity of dynamic attribute management also 
eliminates some key information:  userland can test the existence of the 
attribute to determine if that support is present in the kernel.
