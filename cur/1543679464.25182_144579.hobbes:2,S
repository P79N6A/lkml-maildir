Subject: [RFC] device-mapper v4 ioctl interface implementation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following on from the header file for the v4 ioctl interface that I
posted a couple of weeks ago, here is the first cut at the
implementation (3 patches posted as a follow up to this mail).  I hope
the v1 interface can be retired before 2.6.  Tools are not yet
available to drive this, but should be later this week.
Thoughts ?
