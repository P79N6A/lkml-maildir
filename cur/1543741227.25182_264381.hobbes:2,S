Umm, yeah, but it's *one* big patch (or, if you use my -mm import tree
from bk://smurf.bkbits.net/linux-2.6.X-rcY-mmZ, one BK pull which has
that as a subtree).
Paolo wants to see two distinct ones.
Andrew also does things like
bk-netdev.patch
e1000-module_param-fix.patch
ne2k-pci-pci-build-fix.patch
r8169-module_param-fix.patch
which my mind translates as "there's something stupid, incomplete or
outdated in the bk-netdev tree", or "that tree's maintainer should apply
these patches. Now." (Ideally, of course, my import script should do the
same thing.)
