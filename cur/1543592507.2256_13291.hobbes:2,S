Hi,
Hope this is enough info :P
Unmounting file systems: journal_begin called without kernel lock held
kernel BUG at journal.c:423!
423: invalid operand: 0000
CPU: 0
EIP: 0010: [<c016d740>]
EFLAGS: 00010286
eax: 0000001d ebx: c42edf38 ecx: 00000001 edx:00000001
esi: c12dc800 edi: c42edf38 ebp: 0000000a esp: c42eded0
that's all I wrote down. There was more, please reply to reply-to if
you need more info and anything else I can do to provide more
information. Running Via apollo pro-a on smp MSI694D pro/2x366
reiserfs on /dev/hde8 (/usr) <promise ata100 controller> which seems
to be the cause of the segfault. I can reproduce this everytime with
2.4.5, doesn't happen with earlier versions.
best regards,
Gavin
