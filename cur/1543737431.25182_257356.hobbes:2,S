I am glad to see such enthusiasm :)
The code I have only does it on ATI cards (all radeons, all rage128, some 
mach64). The radeon code is the one that is known to work well.
My personal interest is that Framebuffer -> System Ram transfer is needed
if one wants to use Radeon GPUs for numerical computation. Thus, if there 
is an agreement on what needs to be done and what modifications are 
acceptable I can make this a priority.
What kind of interface would different projects want ? Should I wait for 
Jon's modifications to complete ? What people should we include on CC list ?
Also here is a short description of current km design:
     * km.[c,h] - this provides module registration and DMA queue
       virtualization (note: this is GUI_DMA queue, different from what
       DRM uses)
     * radeon.c, rage128.c, mach64.c - these are hardware specific
       functions
     * km_memory.[c,h] - this is v4l code for reverse mapping, I guess
       it is obsolete in 2.6.x kernels
     * km_api.[c,h] km_api_data.[c,h] - this is a new interface for
       video (and similar devices), an experiment to implement features
       not present in v4l or v4l2.
       ** I am not suggesting this be included. **
     * km_v4l.c - this is a client of km_api that provides v4l
       interface.
The first two pieces can be ported with ease - there are few modifications 
to be made, just cut the code that registers the driver.
The km_api piece will need to be replaced with interface everyone agrees 
on.
Please let me know your comments !
                         best
