Linda, I've got a dual port Intel eepro100 card in this machine. I've had 
it close to a year, with nothing but excellent performance and stability. 
I can't say the same thing for other cards i've tried in here, namingly 
the 3com adapters everyone seems to think are so great. I won't even touch 
a 3com adapter anymore, but i digress...  These dual eepro100 cards can be 
had used for relatively cheap; i think I purchased this one for $45USD 
when i bought it...
