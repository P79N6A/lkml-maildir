Ugh.  That will cause problems when you try to integrate runtime 
suspend.  In fact this whole approach is unsuitable for runtime PM and 
it obscures the similarities between runtime PM and STR.

You don't have to restrict yourself to character devices driving real 
hardware.  The same issues apply to USB and other buses.
