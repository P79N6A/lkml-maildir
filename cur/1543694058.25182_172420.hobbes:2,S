Whoa there.  I am not saying that the other filesystems
are wrong.  All i am saying as i can see no reason why, as
defined, the ctime of a file should be updated when nothing
else in the inode structure as been updated.
Of course if i had designed it in the first place with the
filesystem semantics that we have now there might be no
rename system call.  Renames would be done by link(oldpath,
newpath); unlink(oldpath);  A sequence that would cause
ctime to change as a result of nlink changes.  A sequence
that might be appropriate in some cases even inside the
filesystem code.
If you read my first posting on this thread you will see
that i do see some, albeit questionable, value to the ctime
update as a means of spotting the fact something relating to
the inode has changed.  While not technically required it is
not necessarily wrong to update ctime.  SUSv3 even allows
for it and for some filesystems it would positively be the
right thing to do.
PS.  The name is J.W. or JW and has never been John.
