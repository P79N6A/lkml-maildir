I can guarantee that this is not the case, as I tried on a single-cable
network (crossover cable) with a hot ARP cache on the sending machine with
no joy.  However, I did find the cause of the problem; booting with 'nopnp'
solves my problems completely (at the expense of sound, of course).  Now to
read a pile of docs and figure out how to PnP-configure the sound card but
not the Ethernet card....
