 It wasn't tested back then in July 1999, but later it actually was and
proved correct -- see the note in arch/i386/kernel/apic.c (I can dig
through my archive for patches and mails involved).  A few other problems
were resolved as a result as well, e.g. the logical destination mode
turned out not to work with the i82489DX unless the DFR is set to
0xffffffff explicitly as stated in the manuals (we used to set it to 0xf
earlier, based on documentation on the integrated APICs, and yes, the
i82489DX does support a flat 32-bit logical destination selection), a race
when using INIT IPIs to wake up APs, etc.

 There were actually two documents, sort of complementing each other, also
available as discrete hardcopies. ;-)  If there's interest in the
documents I can think on how to make them available.

 Well, I think the systems are rare enough we'd better keep their
configuration as much similar to the more common ones as possible.  This
way chances are any bug that would hit the formers, will trigger for the
latters as well.  And in this case it's just a few bytes of code as Mikael 
has already proposed.
