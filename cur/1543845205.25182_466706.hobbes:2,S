That involves new conventions beyond printf.  Why not "%p %p %u %u"
for two blobs ... or why implicitly dereference the given pointers.  A
probe handler unaware of a specific marker's semantics would not know
whether or not this is implied.

I understand what you're using them for.  To me, they just don't look
like a good fit.

Inflexible and ugly in what way?  Remember, the macro definitions can
be automatically generated.  At the macro call site, there needs to be
little difference.

Do I understand you correctly that the probe handlers would be given
va_list values, and would have to call va_arg to yank out individual
actual arguments?  So again type safety is a matter of explicit coding
(equivalent to correctly casting each type)?
