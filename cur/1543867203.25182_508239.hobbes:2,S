It may be that the TCP/IP-Stack has to copy the data around. But someone that knows the inner workings would have to answer this.
That may also depend on the used NIC.
Also the data doesn't appear 'en bloc', but arrives over a period of time, so you have more or less big "gaps" in the processing.
Especially the "gaps" can considerably lower total achievable bandwidth.
A little naive fallacy (According to dict.leo.org a translation for: Milchmädchenrechnung):
You get a package of work every (say) 1ms and you (say) need .2ms for processing, shoveling and writing to disc.
Then there is no way you can saturate more than 1/5 of total theoretical bandwidth, because 80% of the time you are waiting for more work to come.
