Subject: 2.6.24-rc1 - Regularly getting processes stuck in D state on startup

I've been testing rc1 for a week or so, and about 25% of the time I'm
seeing Firefox and Thunderbird getting stuck in 'D' state as they startup.
I've attached the output of Sysrq-T to this mail... system is a
dual-core AMD64, and files are on a RAID-1 root partition connected two
SATA disks on the on-board NVidia controller. I've had no problems
before .24 rc1
Cheers
David
