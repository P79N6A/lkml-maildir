Strange. I've watched DVD's etc. Maybe it's not the Xv code, but your
camera code?

There's something wrong with your setup. I watch full-screen DVD's on my
VAIO. It's not really fast enough with just the YUV conversion done in
hardware (it's plenty fast enough if MC and iDCT would be done in HW
too, but ATI doesn't release docs without strict NDA's). But there's no
way DVD's are watchable with sw YUV conversion and scaling.

That one I have no clue about at all.
