These 2 kernel options are turned on by default in my kernel. Here's
snip from .config
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y
# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y
CONFIG_NUMA=y
CONFIG_K8_NUMA=y

So far I have run the test with patched kernel for 6 rounds, and
didn't see the soft lockup. I think this patch should fix the problem.
But what still confused me is that why do we need to invoke
cond_resched() voluntarily since CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY and
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL are both turned on? From my understanding these 2
options should make schedule happen even if CPU is under heavy
load......
Thanks,
