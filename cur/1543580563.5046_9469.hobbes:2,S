Ugh. What chips your KA7 has? As far as I know the KX133 chip (vt8731)
can't do asynchronous PCI, allowing for 2x, 3x and 4x FSB/PCI divisors
only. So I don't a way to have your FSB at 114 and your PCI at 34 with
this chip.

Ok. So do you still have a working 2.2 setup and a non-working 2.4
setup? Would you be able to send me the usual (lspci -vvxxx, dmesg,
hdparm -t /dev/hd*, hdparm -i /dev/hd*, cat /proc/ide/via) data for both
so that I can compare them?
If I find any differences, I'll know what the bug is.
