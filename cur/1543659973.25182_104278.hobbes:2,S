Subject: Minor header bug? MIPS (32-bit) nlink_t sign

Linux/MIPS32 is unusual in that its type of nlink_t is signed.  In the
header <asm-mips64/posix_types.h>, the 32-bit compatibility type for
nlink_t is defined as unsigned.  Perhaps this is because the MIPS
64-bit nlink_t is always unsigned.
Which header is correct - and which should be changed for consistency -
<asm-mips/posix_types.h> or <asm-mips64/posix_types.h>?
Stephen, I guess you have already figured this out with your recent
32-bit compatibility cleanup?
cheers,
