Hello,
Lines 189 and 190 of linux/Documentation/initrd.txt (of 2.2.12) seem to
indicate the pseudofiles /proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-{name,addrs} should be
analogous to the nfs_root_name= and nfs_root_addrs= kernel options in the
same way /proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev is to the root= kernel option.
However, I can't find any actual mention of these procfs files in the
source to either 2.2.12 or 2.3.21, and with a 2.2.12 kernel with
CONFIG_NFS and CONFIG_NFS_ROOT, these files definitely don't show up in
/proc.
I'd like to go ahead and add in support for that, but first I'd like to
know if there is a reason it's not in there already.
Additionally, I'd like to know if there are any objections to making
CONFIG_NFS_ROOT possible with the NFS filesystem driver built as a
module, since I'd like to make that work as well at some point.
Cheers,
J. Rodd
