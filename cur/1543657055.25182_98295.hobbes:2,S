Oh and by the way, this is a dell poweredge 2450, dual 866 p3 cpus, 2gigs
ram, and using a PERC 3/D.  I have a 2.4.1 system running on _identical_
hardware with no problems, and this system that is MCE'ing is a 2.4.16.
So ... not sure if that raises any red flags as far as false/spurious MCEs
are concerned, but either way comments are appreciated.
I will try the nomce option just in case, but I suspect I have bad
hardware.  Again, any comments / war stories appreciated.
thanks!
