I got:
<7>Dead loop on netdevice eth0, fix it urgently!
When using netconsole and printing out some information from kernel to
console.
The box uses:
netconsole=4444@192.168.1.12/eth0,7002@192.168.1.1/
0000:00:0f.0 Ethernet controller: Linksys NC100 Network Everywhere Fast
Ethernet 10/100 (rev 11)
Relevant config:
CONFIG_NET_TULIP=y
# CONFIG_DE2104X is not set
CONFIG_TULIP=y
CONFIG_TULIP_MWI=y
# CONFIG_TULIP_MMIO is not set
CONFIG_TULIP_NAPI=y
Matt, on another box I got some irq off hangs that went away when removing
netconsole from the .config on a box with 3c59x. Is this known? The
problem is getting backtraces when netconsole is active, but the last
thing I see before the box goes is that some carrier is up...
