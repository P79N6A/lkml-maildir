I would define !m as m, e.g. it would allow
dep_tristate "" CONFIG_OLD !$CONFIG_NEW
dep_tristate "" CONFIG_NEW !$CONFIG_OLD
This means only a single driver could be build into the kernel, but both
could be compiled as module.
If we had real expression there, your semantics could easily be described
as $CONFIG!=n, but it wouldn't be possible to describe my semantics.
bye, Roman
