Hi,
The NFS crossmnt/nohide feature has been working beautifully
in 2.6.23. NFS in general has been really good in 2.6.23. Thanks!
However, starting in  2.6.24-rc3-git4, I immediately get 'NFS Stale
file handle' messages for any accesses to the NFS crossmnt'ed
volumes. Regular NFS mounts are fine but the crossmnt'ed
subdirs return only that error message.
2.6.24-rc3-git1 is last known good kernel. The problem also exists
with the latest snap 2.6.24-rc4-git4. NFS server is 2.6.23-rc9 and
is unchanged.
It is easily reproducible here, hopefully for the person who
knows how to debug it too :)
Shane
