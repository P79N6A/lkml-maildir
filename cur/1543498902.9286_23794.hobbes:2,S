Hi,
Swapping on RAID-5 should be 100% safe over the last two years. All the
required resources are pre-allocated to ensure that deadlocks are avoided;
the basic RAID-5 structure, the raid stripe, contains all the buffer
heads and actual buffers required for the completion of that RAID stripe,
and the stripe structures are being recycled during actual use.
We planned to do the same for RAID-1, but never actually implemented it,
so there we have the deadlock potential (although to a much lesser
extent than the very first version of the RAID-5 code -- RAID-1 allocates
only the smaller buffer head structures, rather than actual buffer space).
