This is UP, and not preemptible. And the backtrace may be corrupt, because
when the page fault happens, it will actually page fault _again_ as part
of trying to print out the oops, so the whole thing scrolls largely off
the screen..
I only see this on one of my laptops, and even there it seems to be
timing-dependent or something (I think it only happens when I press a key,
and because the backtrace isn't trustworthy ..)
