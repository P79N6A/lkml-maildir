Second problem seems to be that the extras/ dir missed the executable
bit..
Here's some patches for you:
http://verein.lst.de/~hch/qla/QLA1-kconfig-b7
	use select for CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX, shorten the name
	of the failover option, sanitize kconfig texts.
http://verein.lst.de/~hch/qla/QLA2-noioctl-b7
	make ioctl code optional.  this is a bit ugly because
	sometimes we use defines from exioct.h in non-ioctl
	related code.  Btw, is it just me or is the ioctl code
	never called actually?
http://verein.lst.de/~hch/qla/QLA3-down_timeout-b7
	use a common and simpler variant of the down with timeout
	scheme.  We should probably try to get a proper down_timeout
	as this one still is quite suboptimal..
http://verein.lst.de/~hch/qla/QLA4-module_param-b7
	use new-style module_param() everywhere (works also for
	the compiled-in case).  The paramter naming is quite
	inconsistant and you have global variables like Bind
	that might cause quite some trouble in the non-modular
	case.  You should probably switch to module_param_named
	to always use nice lower_case, descriptive names
	(without the ql2x prefix) and map them to variables with
	a driver-prefix.
http://verein.lst.de/~hch/qla/QLA5-dbg-b7
	Move some debug defines from qla_def.h to qla_dbg.h
http://verein.lst.de/~hch/qla/QLA6-kmem_zalloc-b7
	Use kmalloc directly instead of qla2xxx_kmem_zalloc and
	associated wrappers.
http://verein.lst.de/~hch/qla/QLA7-misc-b7
	Misc changes that don't affect generated code.
