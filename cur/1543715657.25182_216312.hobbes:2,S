BTW I think there is a common misunderstanding about libata:
    it will not replace IDE drivers any time soon.
I want to rewrite+merge current IDE code with libata during 2.7
(and yes, legacy naming and ordering will be preserved!).
I hope nobody starts rewriting existing IDE drivers for libata and pushing
them upstream -> it will mean maintenance problems much bigger than OSS+ALSA.
However writing _new_ libata driver for 'exotic' PATA hardware is OK.
Cheers,
Bartlomiej
