First off: sorry for my late answer.

I hope I got everything right. Here's what I understood so far:
The ACPI Subsystem in the kernel is derived from intel sources. I searched
the web for information about that and finally found
http://www.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
Is that the right one? So what I would have to do in order to
"make the ARRAY_SIZE patch work in both the Linux ACPI CA
and the generic Intel one" is to modify those sources aswell,
send a patch to Intel and another one back to the
lkml.
Is that right? Or am I totally wrong?
	Cheers,
		Andi
