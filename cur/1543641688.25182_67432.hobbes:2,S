These kind of implementation of BUG() is not very useful. Callers
of BUG() and BUG_ON() assume, that the thread is aborted and do
nothing to fixup after BUG(). 
That makes sense, because that way BUG reduces code size and
simplifies actual code by omitting the error handling for errors
which are in the in kernel caller.
So please consider using panic() instead of printk() here to
encourage fixing of BUGs.
Maybe we should even officially define, whether BUG() is an
execution barrier or not. 
I would vote for YES, because of code size reductions under this
assumption.
Thanks & Regards
Ingo Oeser
