Really? Your right. My mistake, how about we let 15,000 other people
know that Securify.com is a bunch of spammers?
Hello everyone, as most of you know that Have used Packet Storm Security
for a source for security programs and a lot of Linux and unix addons..
You will be happy to know they are spammers now. And they respond with
things like below. At least Matt@securify was nice and apologized for the
spam. 
Nobody likes spam, and you can't run a business that spams people. So, go
to hell.
