Can you please produce a metadump data for us?
use debugreiserfs -p /dev/yourdevice | gzip -9c >metadata.gz
then tell us where we can get that file.
Also please use recent reiserfsprogs for that operation
(e.g. version 3.6.4 available from us: 
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserprogs
 )

Let's see if we can reproduce it locally after you give us the metadata.
Thank you.
