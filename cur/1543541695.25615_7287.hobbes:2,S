I think we can simply "pretend" they are - they WILL be on some filing
systems (ext2), but not others (NTFS). Making this as consistent as
possible means making the files as distinct as possible.

The same problem comes up if you treat the files as directories. Or
mountpoints.
I know what we'll do in the ext2 case; ideally, NTFS should do the same.

Under NTFS, no. Under ext2, yes.

We'll have to split them in plenty of cases anyway. Better to regard them
as distinct from the outset wherever possible.
