ah, now i see what you're getting at here:
$ grep EMBEDDED $(find . -name Kconfig\*)
./drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig:       select CARDBUS if !EMBEDDED
./drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig:       bool "Special initialization for O2Micro bridges" if EMBEDDED
./drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig:       bool "Special initialization for Ricoh bridges" if EMBEDDED
./drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig:       bool "Special initialization for TI and EnE bridges" if EMBEDDED
./drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig:       bool "Auto-tune EnE bridges for CB cards" if EMBEDDED
./drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig:       bool "Special initialization for Toshiba ToPIC bridges" if EMBEDDED
./drivers/ata/Kconfig:  depends on EMBEDDED || ARCH_RPC
./drivers/acpi/Kconfig: bool "Power Management Timer Support" if EMBEDDED
./drivers/ide/Kconfig:  depends on ALPHA || SUPERH || IA64 || EMBEDDED
... snip ...
  in my opinion, the config option "EMBEDDED" is just plain silly.  as
i mentioned earlier, there may be other reasons that people want to
de-activate normally selected features rather than just for strictly
embedded systems.
  here's an example:
drivers/input/keyboard/Kconfig:
...
menuconfig INPUT_KEYBOARD
        bool "Keyboards" if EMBEDDED || !X86
        default y
...
  so i should only be allowed to de-activate keyboard support if i
claim i'm working on an "embedded" system?  that's absurd.  maybe it's
a 64-CPU monster server that just happens to be running headless and
needs no keyboard.  making that selection dependent on EMBEDDED is
just silly in that case.
  anyway, must pack up and dash off for a few hours, but i'm hoping
you can see my point.  i don't disagree that there should be a way to
de-select normally selected features.  i just think the way it's being
done now is hideously misnamed.
