This patch converts ioctl call to unlocked_ioctl form. It's possible
due to rtl_lock spinlock protection.

The patch is *not* tested but the patch does not bring _much_ changes
so it wouldn't break the compilation procedure.
If there is problem with attachment - i could send it as inline
form today evening.
Andi, Jiri, Alexey the only thing I do complain about -
is time set/read from several user threads that uses same
(duplicated) file descriptor. Could there be useless thread
spins instead of sleep (in case if this unlocked_ioctl were
protected by mutex)?
