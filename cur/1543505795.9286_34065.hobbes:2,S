Subject: merging knfsd patches with mainstream kernel

Will this ever occur (ie, are there at least distant plans), or has it
basically been decided that knfsd will remain outside of the mainstream
kernel tree forever?
If there are plans to include it eventually, what are the prerequisites
for this to occur?
