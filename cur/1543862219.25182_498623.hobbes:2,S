...as Roland mentions, we're not completely free to change the filehandle
usage,
it's shared by ~5 drivers now.
I'd say lets investigate the direction of an own filesystem unless
there's no other clean solution.
We can polish the current version a bit, but that won't change the "magic
offsets".
Roland, could you take this patchset into your tree?
We hope it adresses the major security concern and vm_insert_page.
We're preparing the next patch for the yield deadlock topic with this
patchset as prereq.
