Subject: Digest services anywhere and Re: LKML on Majordomo2 ?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/8/24/148

Just another question ...
The LKML FAQ does not point out any site providing decent digest
services ... (by decent I mean it would be easier to split up the
digest using formail) The yahoogroups/egroups archive has this
horrible way of digesting mails ... Any pointers would be welcome ...
I checked the archives. There seems to a long discussion last year on
making a move to either Majordomo2 or Mailman. Mailman has improved a
lot over all this time. Is it still worth a go?
