I definitely ACK this patch, it's needed for the same reasons we need
pselect and ppoll.

This part I'd clean up a bit, though.  Move the if (sigmask) test to the
top and have the EINTR test decide what to do.  As is the code would be
a bit irritating if it wouldn't be so trivial.  The important thing is
that you only do something special if sigmask != NULL.
