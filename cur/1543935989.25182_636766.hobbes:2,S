I have a few outstanding things but just go ahead; if you get there first I'll
resolve conflicts, if I get there first.. you'll have to ;-) It's not a big deal,
I'm trying to keep my changes to these areas really self contained small steps
because of the fragility (and because it's just a good idea in general), so any
clashes should also be easy to resolve either way
