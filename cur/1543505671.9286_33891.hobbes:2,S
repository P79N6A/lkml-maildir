it might also help trond's nfsv3 work if there was a per-file cluster size
that was initialized to a system default (64k, or 8k, or get_maxreadahead)
and then varied as necessary.
i think you'd need to maintain some kind of data structure for each
cluster in a file, like a bitmap or histogram, to watch how many pages
were faulted in each cluster.
