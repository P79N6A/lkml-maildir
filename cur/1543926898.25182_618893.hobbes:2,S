Part of the building the alternative design requires aggreeing to
build sections common.
Like the netlabels.  We need this for other parts like filesystems.

Bigger problem Containers are processor neutral Xen and lot of the
other solutions are not.  There are advantages for people who don't
need full blown.  There needs to be two levels.  Ie VM for the heavy.
 Containers for where the security is needed but no to the point of
needing two different kernels.  Now restricting what can be in a
Container due to some poor reason that has not been attempted to be
worked around is not a valid reason.   In theory using Containers you
should be able to run every Linux distro on earth under one kernel as
long as it supports that series kernel.  Ie 2.6 2.4...  Now that is
only the base level of Containers.  More advanced Zones like solaris
will see other platforms running in a container under the same kernel.
 Current designing around containers is not dealing with what I can
do.  It more how will we hack it to work.  Not make sure it will
support where Container design can go.

This is the problem for containers File access controls need to be
like netlabels common between LSM's.
Yes this is going to get up noses.

This is the problem it is a conflict of requirements.

Containers doing them will just require some parts becoming default no
matter the LSM.  I am not exactly happy with LSM is due to the
conflict.  Because there are features Containers will require no
matter the LSM loaded.  At moment only LSM's provide them in different
ways.  So running Containers becomes a lot harder than it should be to
imposable to get what containers truly offers.
Basic idea of containers and cgroups.  Is that everyone can use them
directly.  Of course each layer should only be able to give less
access than the layer above it.
I hope segmenting LSM would allow focus and reduce code base size.
Less mine is better than yours arguments comparing LSM to each other
as a whole is basically imposable to come to a single solution due too
many differences to fight over at one time.  So instead of selinux and
apparmor and other LSM fighting over there complete system.  It would
better to do it segment by segment.  This could allow common
agreements for parts to be formed less code to look after.   Some
answers will have to be both.  Current design of LSM has no chance of
creating a single LSM that does everyones need effectively.  Instead
current design of LSM allows duplication.  Its a design failure.
cgroups provide things like memory usage limits, memory allocation
preferences(What application gets to keep itself in ram), cpu access
limits and so on as well .  Fully functional containers need to be
able to contain whatever distro happens to be in there from the rest
of the system.  Also it has to Independent to the LSM being used.  Too
far independent means doubling of code.  What is needed is shared
modules.  Modules used by LSM and Containers to do security.   The
segments LSM makers fight over how to do become both container
features and shared code.
Its a hard thing to come to grips with is that containers is a
security model in its own right.   If you can isolate something inside
containers system it should be out of reach of the rest of the system
if person using containers wish this.   Now if person uses containers
might only want to  control one of memory, cpu, disk or device access
this is perfectly acceptable too.
Applications controlling containers in theory could model most
security models.  Usermode testing of a security mode or even
applications doing there own internal security models independent of
distros.  PAM the login system can also use containers to limit user
memory usage or cpu access now.  Could have pam forbid users from
being able to switch to root at all or even put users in there own
virtual space..   Security features no longer stop at the LSM.  PAM
could be allocating them based on ldap or other user locations no
matter the LSM in use.  Windows 2000 XP and Vista in a network can be
secured from the ADS.  Same trick login system apply security.
The major differences is flexibility, maintainability and standardisation.
Other major issue with LSM how would you make it for Distro neutral
programs like LSB programs be correctly secured on every Distro.
Since system admins threw to users can be using containers
applications can use them as well like firefox could use it to contain
it scripts and the like from being able to do user harm without user
consent.
As everyone knows every person likes there own distro.  Making a user
operate a distro they don't like will reduce there effectiveness.
Current LSM does not address a completely secured network with mixed
Distros.
Basically LSM was designed pre Containers, pre Linux on a desktop and
pre Linux applications needing to run and operate across distros and
stay secure.  Its showing its age and soon its going to start being a
bugger to operate with.  Its basically reached a redesign point for
future need containers offer part of the solution.  LSM still have a
place after Containers.  Just a different one to now.  Construction of
the LSM needs to change.   Staying with status quo is just trouble.
My ideas maybe not be the complete solution.  Outside of demons may
stay the role of LSM alone..  The internals of applications and pam
system on the common core of Containers.  In the process as much code
as able shared.
