It looks like the latest XFS changes haven't been pulled yet, so
it's not new code that is triggering this....

Hmmm - that is bizarre. What is the output of xfs_bmap -vvp <filename>
on each of those files?
what happens to these files after then are downloaded? Does it only
happen to append-only files or are other files affected as well?
BTW, what's the 'xfs_info <mntpt>' output for this filesystem?

I'd be surprised if it was a link count problem - that would cause
all sorts of other problems as well....

Yes, it means everythign is ok. You only have to worry when xfs_check
says something - it only brings bad news ;)
