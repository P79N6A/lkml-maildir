Yes, and for heavens sake don't use it, because the reiserfs merge got
some dirty inode logic wrong. pre7 fixes just that one line and should
be ok again.

Yes. It's really nice for some stuff, but a bit too aggressive for
normal use, I think.
If you want to play with tuning, I'd suggest something like
 - make SWAP_SHIFT bigger (try with 7 instead of 5)
 - do the "self-swap-out" only for __GFP_VM allocations, and add the
   __GFP_VM flag to all page fault allocations (ie __GPF_VM would be a
   flag that says "this allocation will grow my RSS"). 
The latter is kind of debatable - some allocations can't easily be put
in one category or the other (ie page cache growing - do we do it
because of the page cache or because we want to map the page?)
