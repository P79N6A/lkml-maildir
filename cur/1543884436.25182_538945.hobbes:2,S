If you start up at zero (like you did once too - see above and ask Johannes if you do not remember at all) it is no good start at all if your humble effort is being thrown off after the first or second reject. That's highly discouraging, and if it happens very often the bad experience remains in one's own subjective perception filter.
i did really start very small during those early stages. Johannes did
help me a lot in many areas, he gave me a lot of valuable information,
for which i am thankful to him. The same goes to Ralph Metzler and many
others who gave me a big hand to bootup. Can't forget Andrew, Marcel et
all in this regard (I did try to pass on such information to some
people, they thought i was trying to sabotage their project etc. I
stopped responding publicly as you might have seen. At one point i did
throw away all DVB development, i did write the same on the #linuxtv IRC
channel, did send a mail to Johannes too on that) It was just one user
who got me back again on it, a North American DVB user
In many cases it would be very nerving to work on hardware that is
extremely undocumented. Sometimes you will have to wait for weeks for a
certain person (persons who worked on the chips etc. On top of this
people who worked on the devices will move away to newer organizations.
Currently facing the same with another chip) to be free to provide an
answer for the question. In short requires a lot of patience. On top of
this when someone flames you in the little time one has.. well, many a
times i lost my temper, yes.
Sorry, if i was real bad.

I did my best to help, but in the end I nothing but wasted time - and after all, I do not remember where the repository resides, after thaddatil.net has been down for months now... What a pity!
No, the cx878 project never died. thadathil.net was hosted at my office.
When the office moved a bit and some other complications, thadathil.net
went offline. on top of that, at work i was given additional
responsibilities for which i was struggling real hard. work with regards
to DVB i just do it in my spare time, but i try to steal away some time
from office work as well.
Christoph usually used to review all my code as well as some others.
With the upcoming KDE4, he was working more with kaffeine and had little
time, himself.
And as you might be aware i was working with a new delivery system
DVB-S2. When one works with a new delivery system, the existing API
proved too restrictive. Then working on which i trampled onto many
issues (not even referring to the new delivery system, or the issues
with the demodulator, mind you S2 is a bit complex and can really
confuse people.) with DVB-CORE itself, which led to another API update
other than multiproto, the Adapter API extensions. while on this again
stumbled where advanced operations where performed at the in kernel
demuxer, not forgetting an additional DSS demuxer is also needed in
kernel for DSS support.
With all these and struggling hard with 4 hours sleep, well i couldn't
take all those flames (More than what you see on the ML's many people
tend to send private mails for some reason or the other for help.
Normally i don't reject anyone's request), you can say i was kind of
worn out. Above all these some developers were very "unfriendly", some
did mischief (politics) too, which led to a larger rift.
So i chose to remain silent. That's all.
During this period, Julian was kind enough to provide me hosting for my
requirements. I will try to get thadathil.net up soon (many people used
to have firmware downloads from there, also some people had access there
for hosting test repo's and so on)
Well, that was a long rant
