Hi, 
adb driver in 2.6.7-rc1 fails to create /dev/adb (noticed because
pbbuttonsd complains and doesn't work).
I looked at the differences with 2.6.6's driver, and saw that the
devfs bit was removed. Was there a reason for that, apart the fact that
devfs is obsolete ?
Here's a patch that restores previous behaviour. (I bothered because I
noticed lots of other drivers still using devfs_mk_cdev() and I think
it should stay here for a bit more).
hth,
