Subject: forcedeth as a module only?

hi,
are there any known issues with the forcedeth driver when statically
compiled in? i have an onboard GbE ethernet controller (see below) and
forcedeth seems to work pretty fine for this controller. it's 100Mbps
only, but i don't care because my switch is 100Mbps too.
i've noticed that the driver just does not work, when it's compiled with
CONFIG_FORCEDETH=y
eth0: forcedeth.c: subsystem: 01462:0250 bound to 0000:00:05.0
eth0: no link during initialization
recompiling the same kernel (2.6.12-rc6-mm1, x86_64) with
CONFIG_FORCEDETH=m and loading the module without any parameters get the
NIC up. mii-tool does not work in both cases, CONFIG_MII is set to "y".
any hints?
thank you,
Christian.
