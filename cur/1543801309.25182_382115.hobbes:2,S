I don't know how much of a pain this would be, but maybe you could 
arrange the links on the Kernel.org front page to visually cue people 
that the 2.6.15 Linus release is a base for all of the patches. Say, 
put the 2.6.15 in double-size text and put the other branches 
underneath in smaller text and leaders, like a family tree.
