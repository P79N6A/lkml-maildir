Loopback with encryption is not the same as a crypto filesystem.
Loopback encryption works transparently with any (non-)crypto fs.
A potential attacker can use this to look for the ext2 superblock,
which gives him the same data both encrypted an unencrypted. A real
cryptofs would go through great pains to take such advantages away.
