I'd prefer not to.  Once a patch has been in -mm for this long I really
prefer to not see wholesale replacements.  When people do this to me I
usually turn their replacements into incremental patches so we can see what
changed.  Which is useful.
Your first patch was identical to what I already have, so I dropped that.
Your second patch made these changes:

The first hunk is surely wrong - pre_preempt_count is a local unsigned
integer, not a function.
And I'm not sure about the second hunk either - surely an `eip' should
point at an instruction, not be assigned the value of an instruction?
So I'll drop both patches.  If you have bugfixes, please make them relative
to already-merged things.  Against most-recent -mm is best, as I do fix
patches up, and other people send fixes which you might not have merged
locally.  And please ensure that the changes compile and run with and
without CONFIG_PREEMPT!
