That's correct. But how do you derive that the sh command line must
behave the same? The sh command is not the sh special built-in.
However, it would be reasonable if a /bin/sh set $1 to be "-- xyzzy" if
a file "foo" with
#! /bin/sh -- xyzzy
was executed (as path = [/bin/sh] argv = [./foo] [-- xyzzy]);
and although I didn't check, I wonder how shells without the "--" long
options parse that line.
