 Hmm, you state the watchdog works from time to time and the log you

What chipset do you use (check with lspci)?
 In any case the code should not hang there in any case -- it the watchdog
appears stuck, it reports it and goes on.  A hang almost surely means
hardware locked up.

 No need to worry.  The code finds an unknown bit set in the version
register (well, the bit is unknown to the code -- the bit is documented
and we should mark it as such in the code soon, probably as a part of P4
support).

 Various reports seem to indicate XFree86 cannot cope with 2.4 SMP as it
should.  It's possible they do not handle synchronization well.
