No, it's a never before seen event.  That said, I have had a couple of
dead box after resume events with other kernels in the last few months,
so I may have had corruption of a more deadly variety.  Unfortunately,
when I'm resuming, my serial console box is almost guaranteed to be off.
Rebuilding this particular kernel with slab debugging would probably be
a waste of time since stable kernels get very little runtime here, but
I'll re-add it to my config for test kernels just in case a survivable
event should happen.
