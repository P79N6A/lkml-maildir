Well, I'm obviously not Larry, so here are my 2ct:
Subversion is superior to CVS in all respects, but that is not an 
overly strong statement. The main problem is that it is centralized in 
a way that hinders the parallel existence of development branches 
because it does not properly support the shuffling of changes back and 
forth between trees. It all works fine until you want to _partially_ 
synchronize two trees and keep the ability to continue development on 
both of them. (Been there, done that, it was a major PITA even in a 
rather small project. Works fine for my PhD thesis, though ;-) )
That said, it would of course be possible to improve the internal 
workflow of our emperor penguin if he used subversion, but the 
collaboration with others could not benefit the way it does with a 
changeset-based approach.

Linux kernel development is hard _and_ sexy :-)
