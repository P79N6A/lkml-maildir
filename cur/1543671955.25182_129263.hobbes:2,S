I don't think so. Please read a few lines below:

If one tries to read an '0xabc' or even '0732' entry in the data buffer,
sscanf returns '-1'. The problem seems to be that 'sscanf' claims for
'base=10' every time, and this prevents 'simple_strtoul' (and the other
conversion routines) from extracting the desired base out of the input
string (format string declarations works fine, as you stated!).

As I can see, 'base=10' is used for all conversions except for '%x' and
'%o'. If '%i' or '%u' are given, base should be really set to 0, what is
not the case (it is fixed to 10 instead!).
