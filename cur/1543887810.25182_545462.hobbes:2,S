Andrew,
This is the standalone on-demand readahead patchset that applies to
linux-2.6.22-rc1-mm1. It _replaces_ the current readahead algorithm with
the on-demand readahead algorithm that was first introduced in mail
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/25/182.
patchset:
[PATCH 1/9] readahead: introduce PG_readahead
[PATCH 2/9] readahead: add look-ahead support to __do_page_cache_readahead()
[PATCH 3/9] readahead: MIN_RA_PAGES/MAX_RA_PAGES macros
[PATCH 4/9] readahead: data structure and routines
[PATCH 5/9] readahead: on-demand readahead logic
[PATCH 6/9] readahead: convert filemap invocations
[PATCH 7/9] readahead: convert splice invocations
[PATCH 8/9] readahead: convert ext3/ext4 invocations
[PATCH 9/9] readahead: remove the old algorithm
