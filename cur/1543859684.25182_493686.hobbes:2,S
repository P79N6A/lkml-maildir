So Microsoft is right, the legal status of Linux software _is_ unclear. 
You just gave them every reason to continue their campaign against 
Linux. <Don't use Linux, its legal status is unclear, you may get sued>.
The problem is, nobody wants to decide what to do with closed source 
software in Linux. I don't care how you decide, for or against binary 
drivers (well, actually I do but my opinion doesn't matter), just decide 
already!
