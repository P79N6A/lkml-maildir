If you have a problem, email me with your IP address, I have a tcpdump
running.

The remote is in fact zeus-pub.kernel.org. I assume it does not have a
broken firewall, and I sure haven't, and it sends out to me:
00:46:31.936667 192.168.1.4.34018 > 204.152.189.116.80: S 2786942165:2786942165(0) win 5840

	<nop,nop,timestamp 26909481 3563902477> (DF)
So I would rule out 1), as this is a network that does not have the problem.

This looks more likely, on the outgoing SYN. We'll know tomorrow evening
(CEST) or earlier if somebody with the problem volunteers.
