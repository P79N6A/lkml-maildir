How does the kernel get more than five parameters?
Currently...
	eax	= function code
	ebx	= first parameter
	ecx	= second parameter
	edx	= third parameter
	esi	= fourth parameter
	edi	= fifth parameter
Some functions like mmap() take 6 parameters!
Does anybody know how these parameters get passed?
I have an "ultra-light" 'C' runtime library I have
been working on and, so-far, I've got everything up
to mmap()  (in syscall.h) (89 functions) working.
I thought, maybe ebp was being used, but it doesn't
seem to be the case.
Maybe after 5 functions, there is a parameter list
passed by pointer???? I don't have a clue and I
can figure out the code, it's really obscure...
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
