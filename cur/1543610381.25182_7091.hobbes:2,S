Quite frankly, right now I'm in "handle only bugs that can crash the
system mode". Anything that takes 497 days to see is fairly low on my
priority list. My highest priority, in fact, is to get 2.4.15 out without
any embarrassment.
Because it's not as if time stops when Marcelo takes over. I've suggested
to him that he wait for a while just to see what the real problem spots
are, but he'll have a full-time job integrating patches.
Note that I'll probably do the same thing: when I release 2.4.15, I'll at
the same time release a 2.5.0 that is identical except for version number
(that makes synchronization easier later on). And I'll probably _not_
start accepting all the big waiting patches immediately, I'd rather wait
for at least a week or two to see that there aren't any other issues.
It's much easier doing some of the IO patches in particular knowing that
the base you start out from is stable.
