The below code works for us.  Note that I did not implement the
node-interleaving parts of the AMD algorithm.  If that matters, it should
be simple enough to do.  The BKDG has good pseudo-code.  The only thing it
gets absolutely wrong is the IO hole.
Let me know if you see any problems here.  This is a userspace tool, but
should be trivial to adapt.
