Yes, if we entered S5 in the last step of the hibernation sequence, the right
thing to do would be to make the resumed kernel reinitialize ACPI from
scratch.

Usually it goes like that.  Still, you can pass "acpi=off" to the boot kernel,
in which case it won't reinitialize ACPI.

Well, this is not the case on any systems that I have access to, including
two quite modern notebooks.  Apparently, everything works without ACPI on
these machines.
Besides, in theory, it's possible to use an "intelligent" boot loader to read
the hibernation image and that doesn't need ACPI for anything.

It is possible, but I haven't seen that yet.

I think it's even more complicated.  The ACPI state of the resumed kernel
has to match whatever is preserved by the platform.
Well, my impression is that our current ACPI resume code actually expects
the platform to preserve something and if that's missing the devices in
question are not handled properly.  If that really is the case, there is the
question whether we can do something about it in a reasonable way and I can't
answer it right now.
Besides, I really think that we should use the ACPI S4 state, because machines
generally support that.
