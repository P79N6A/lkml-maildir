The patches look reasonable to me - mergeable after updating them for
today's batch of review commentlets.
I have two high-level problems though.
a) I don't yet have a sense of whether this implementation
   is appropriate/sufficient for the various other
   applications which people are working on.
   If the general shape is OK and we think this
   implementation can be grown into one which everyone can
   use then fine.

We need to go over this work before we can commit to the BC
core.  Last time I looked at the VM accounting patch it
seemed rather unpleasing from a maintainability POV.
And, if I understand it correctly, the only response to a job
going over its VM limits is to kill it, rather than trimming
it.  Which sounds like a big problem?
