Argh, wrong one, it's supposed to be:
        print_modules();
        printk("CPU:    %d\nEIP:    %04x:[<%08lx>]    %s VLI\nEFLAGS: %08lx"
                        "   (%s) \n",
                smp_processor_id(), 0xffff & regs->xcs, regs->eip,
                print_tainted(), regs->eflags, system_utsname.release);
        print_symbol("EIP is at %s\n", regs->eip);
but the result is the same.  Also note that the modules line is also
missing from the posted oops.
(Why does x86 duplicate the register dumping between process.c and
traps.c ?)
