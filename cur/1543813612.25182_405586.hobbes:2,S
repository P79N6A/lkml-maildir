    No, it's not on the same level. It's on the same level as giving
your thesis draft to a comrade so he can study and pass his exams,
and in turn he publish the thesis as his and charge money for that.
    I don't want my work used by a corporation without giving any
modification under the same conditions under I published my work.
Binary driver can and will do harm if allowed.
