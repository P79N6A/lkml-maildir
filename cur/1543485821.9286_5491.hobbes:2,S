I don't think it is reasonable. If you want your application to only bind
to some addresses (like the "limited INADDR_ANY" you propose) you should 
change the application to bind to all addresses it is interested in. 
Also adding special cases for single or multiple IP systems is a bad kludge,
because it violates the principle of least astonishment. Allowing other
applications to steal packets is not acceptable, no matter how many IPs
anyways.

Don't change the meaning of INADDR_ANY. If an application does not want
INADDR_ANY it should not use it (but bind explicitely to the IP addresses
it wants instead). But if it asked for INADDR_ANY it should get it, without
any trapdoors.
