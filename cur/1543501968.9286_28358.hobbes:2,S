Hello,
We are seeing these messages in the log file quite frequently on our
SMP RH 6.0 with 2.2.5-22SMP kernel :
Jul  6 18:32:03 strichnine kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 51 to 2 
Jul  6 18:33:04 strichnine kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 51 to 3 
Jul  6 18:34:05 strichnine kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 51 to 4 
Jul  6 18:35:06 strichnine kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 51 to 5 
The strange thing (may be not related) is that when we are running
a CPU intensive task (like povray), both CPU are now reported by xosview
to use 100%. Yesterday evening, only one CPU was to 100%, the other
one was still 0% or so (which is what we expected to be, in fact).
Another thing is that we have to many :
Jul  6 14:19:49 strichnine kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_
blocks: bit already cleared for block 4227708 
Jul  6 14:19:49 strichnine last message repeated 5 times
Jul  6 14:19:49 strichnine kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_
inode: bit already cleared for inode 1056805 
Jul  6 14:19:49 strichnine kernel: lookup_by_inode: ino 1056805 not found in h 
Jul  6 14:19:49 strichnine kernel: find_fh_dentry: 08:11/1056805 dir/1056778 not
 found! 
messages in the log files as well.
I can not switch to 2.2.10-ac8 as I'd like to do, because a remote cpio
(used by our backup procedures) is silently failing in the middle of
nowhere.
A+,
