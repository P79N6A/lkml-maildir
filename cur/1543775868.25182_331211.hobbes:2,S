    Andrew> What's the thinking behind the VM_DONTCOPY there?
As I said before, I don't think the thinking behind VM_DONTCOPY was
correct thinking.  Let's take it out.
I've now answered all your questions on this patchset (or at least
written something in response to all your questions ;).  What's your
feeling on merging?  If more info is required, just let me know.  I'll
also be at the kernel summit in a couple of weeks if you want to go
over it in person.
 - R.
There's no need to set VM_DONTCOPY when mmap()ing the hardware
doorbell page into userspace.
