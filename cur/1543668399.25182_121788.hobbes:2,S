The default size of a tmpfs filesystem is 50% of RAM.  That can be
overridden by setting the size explicitly, CaT is offering percent
instead.  Which is nice, and neatly done.
But I do agree with you that it seems a bit strange, not to take
swap into account at all.  That's one reason I never bothered to
add the feature CaT proposes before.  Just imagine you keep swap
at some % of your RAM, then it'll all scale together.
