It's not that simple - remember that you must be able to open a tty
in non-blocking mode while someone else is opening the same tty in
blocking mode, _and_ succeed.  (iow, the getty waiting for call-in
and you want to dial out case.)
If we go for merely replacing BKL with some other lock, each tty
driver has to be able to drop that lock when it decides to sleep due
to no carrier in its open method... which is kind'a yuck.
