It is independent of PIDs being guessable or not. With really random
PIDs you can still create link(s) in /tmp and after some number of tries
you can win the race (especially when you can execute the suid program
in question yourself).
32 bits would be some help here, but that doesn't fixes the problem,
only makes you wait longer.
