Why are we changing the enable code?
If you are not a registered device in the list and you do not report with
a storage class of 0x0101, then you do not get enabled, period.
This is going to break a whole bunch of cards and systems.
So undo this nonsense and stop dorking up the cards.
Sheesh the chipset folks are making ATA hosts that report as
SCSI	0x0100
EIDE	0x0101
RAID	0x0104
MASS	0x0180
Do not mess with ID clas signatures! Please!
