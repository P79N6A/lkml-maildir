This is true if the cacheline were not present already at
the time of the non-temporal store.
I know what you're trying to say, I'm just clarifying.
The real question is if a large enough ratio of those
cachelines in the page get similarly accessed.  I happen
to think the answer to that for any real example is yes.
Yet, I have no way to prove this.
It would be cool to do some hacks under Xen or user-mode
Linux to get some real statistics about this.  Actually,
this could be done also with hacks to valgrind or other
similar tools.  QEMU could also be used.
