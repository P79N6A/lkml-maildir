Indeed.
By the way, flush_cache_page() is defined as a do-while(0) on x86.
Would it better to define fix_riprel() as a do-while(0) on x86-32?
I think this obviously indicates that function has no effect.

OK, I agree about that fix_riprel() which is ifdef'd twice is too much ifdef'd.
Reducing ifdef is good to me.
