The clock algorithm works _only_ if the page/buffer cache are equally
distributed on the MM.
I just fixed the swap issue. I think Linus will accpet my code into 2.3.x
then after some bit of 2.3.x testing we can backport _only_ the
interesting bits to 2.2.x by using a bit longer 2.2.x-pre-patch stage (to
give it a larger 2.2.x testing). I can handle this backport task fine when
the time will came.
