I didn't complain about the complexity but about the requirement of an
additional tool. However, I think it will be configurable.

I don't see why an additional tool would be needed here. kexec already
modifies symbols, so why not adding the functionality into kexec? The
advantage would be that there's no on-disk modification necessary.
Another issue: Some parameters of makedumpfile (currently the page
size) are read from the running system. If you build the configuration
file while building the kernel, you always have the .config which
contains the page size. So it would be possible to extend the
makedumpfile utility to read that parts from a .config, and that would
remove a dependency that page size of the running kernel matches the
page size of the building kernel. On IA64, that's not always the case.

Aggreed. Your suggestion? :)
Thanks,
