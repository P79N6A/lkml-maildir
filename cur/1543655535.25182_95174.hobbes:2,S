I have also stopped using 2.4.20-ac1 on my ThinkPad.
It performs much worse than 2.4.20-pre8-ac1 when running
large applications such as OpenOffice.  (It never crashed
on me, though.)  Having read the recent thread on changes
to the scheduler and yield(), I suspect that the problem
is related to that, since the 2.4-ac series has the O(1)
scheduler.
If my suspicion is correct, then I concur with the opinion
that O(1) should not be backported to mainline 2.4.
