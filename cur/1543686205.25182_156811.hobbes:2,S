i have managed to resolder that pin, the kernel detects a clock speed of
75mhz again. The 2.4 kernels still don't work though. I've tried using
both a modular build and one with everything tailored to the system.
I don't have the oops message on hand, but i can get it if required. As
always, i can't check it on the hardware itself.
Thanks in advance,
    Matthew
