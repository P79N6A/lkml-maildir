Upgraded my kernel from 2.6.23-rc2 to 2.6.23-rc5.
 System hangs (caps lock and scroll lock leds are both
flashing).
 It *randomly* happens but most of the time during
after login to KDE.
 I have not investigated it yet because I have not
tried doing it
 before.
 Also the system is really not responding so I can't
do much.. Just
 hope it blue screen so I can send the error code
easily :)
Just CC me bec I'm not subscribed.
 Regards,
