I think it's better to split because the first patch (renumbering) seems
to be a good thing even if the second patch were not to be applied.
Experience proves that individual patches that do just one thing are
more likely to be accepted quickly than big ones, thus my advice.

That won't be needed. If you have good reasons for your choice, it's
fine with me. I was just wanting to avoid a policy change without a
reason. Since you know why you changed, it's OK (with me at least).
