There were enough changes in my last round of cleaning up
proc I had to break up the patch series into smaller chunks,
and my last chunk never got resent.
This patchset gives proc dynamic inode numbers (the static inode
numbers were a pain to maintain and prevent all kinds of things), and
removes the horrible switch statements that had to be kept in sync
with everything else.  Being fully table driver takes us 90% of the
way of being able to register new process specific attributes in proc.
Before I start on the next set of changes to proc I want to get
this set out of my hair.
