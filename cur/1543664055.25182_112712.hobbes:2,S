This is what the "anonymous rework" is about. There is already a fix
extant for the file-backed case, which I presumed you knew of already,
and so were were speaking of issues with the anonymous case.
My impression thus far is that the anonymous case has not been pressing
with respect to space consumption or cpu time once the file-backed code
is in place, though if it resurfaces as a serious concern the anonymous
rework can be pursued (along with other things).
