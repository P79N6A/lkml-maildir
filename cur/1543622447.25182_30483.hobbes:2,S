No.  Java doesn't have pointers or explicit memory management.
This means it cannot do some of the things that real OSes tend
to do all the time, in all pieces of real OS source code.
While a course using Java might be able to tell you about the
principles of OSes, it won't help you understand the worst
magic going on in the source code of real OSes...
