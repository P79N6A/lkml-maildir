Though not with this chipset this lockup did already appear a few times on the
list. Im my case it happened on a i815 based system. It seems that something is
going wrong during (apm?) screen blanking when there is interrupt activity.
Unfortunately the system is frozen solid so there's no chance for any debug
trace. It would be nice if someone with detail knowledge of the blanking code
could have a look.
