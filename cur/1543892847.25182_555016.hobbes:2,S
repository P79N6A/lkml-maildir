Depends on whether the cpus are allocated to a customer or to a job.
For the most part I would expect any job to be restart either on a
different machine, or at a different time, but of course it doesn't have
to be that way.

I'm not sure that clones of self will happen often enough to make a
special case for them :)
Anyway the patch I sent is simple enough, and if users end up demanding
the ability to better deal with exclusive cpusets, the patch will be
simple enough to extend by changing cpuset_auto_setup(), so let's
stick with that patch since it's your preference (IIUC).
