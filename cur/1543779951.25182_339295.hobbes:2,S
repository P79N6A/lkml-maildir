That is a surprising statement given what we just discussed. Things 
are not lean and fast but weirdly screwed up. The policy layer is

deliver (see BIND).

Address space migration? That is something new in this discussion. So 
could you explain what you mean by that? I have looked at page migration 
in a variety of contexts and could not see much difference.
