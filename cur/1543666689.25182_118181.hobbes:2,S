Hi,
I have following situation:
PC1    ---------   PC2    --------- PC3
eth0               eth0           eth1
                   eth1
on PC2 ip_forward = 0. 
If I now try to ping from PC3 to PC2 eth0 I can ping
it, also the most dangerous I can telnet to eth0 even
if ip_forward is 0. Am I missing something or what is
wrong here ???
Thanks for the answer, Frenk
