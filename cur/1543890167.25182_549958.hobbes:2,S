New testbed based on minilzo complete.
Results from run using 1000 runs to generate averages:
1000 run averages:
'Tiny LZO':
        Combined: 55.196 usec
        Compression: 37.132 usec
        Decompression: 18.064 usec
'miniLZO':
        Combined: 55.785 usec
        Compression: 40.862 usec
        Decompression: 14.923 usec
(using (tiny/full)/100 for percentages:
'Tiny' is 0.9% faster on average
Same for the Compression
'safe' decompressor from tiny is 1.2% slower than unsafe from minilzo)
Newer version attached - same TODO items as the previous.
