OK, they merged OK.  We're accumulating rather a lot of cgroups work.
I have a question mark over these:
cgroups-make-root_list-contains-active-hierarchies-only.patch
cgroups-add-inactive-subsystems-to-rootnodesubsys_list.patch
cgroups-add-inactive-subsystems-to-rootnodesubsys_list-fix.patch
cgroups-introduce-link_css_set-to-remove-duplicate-code.patch
cgroups-introduce-link_css_set-to-remove-duplicate-code-fix.patch
it wasn't clear to me whether you still had issues with them, or
whether updates were expected?
