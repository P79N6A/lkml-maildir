The scope here was just the case that Eric seemed to be 
trying to address, the way I understood it, and hence a much 
simpler subset of the problem at hand, since it is not really
tackling the rouge/buggy cases. There is no restriction on 
where DMA can happen, just a block of memory area set aside 
for the dormant kernel to use when it is instantiated. 
So this is an area that the current kernel will not use or 
touch and not specify as a DMA target during "regular" 
operation.

Not really, this isn't about matching DMA target areas. Its
about the new kernel ignoring memory that the old kernel was 
using and only using the reserved area of memory which the
old kernel was expected to have left alone in normal operation.
This is not the entire spectrum of situations where any physical
address could be a potential DMA target, due to a buggy kernel
which could have passed any address to the device concerned.
For that case, of course, quiescing the devices seems like the 
best way out so far.
So whether such reservation would solve the case you see
would depend on whether the old DMA operation is targetted at
a valid buffer in the old kernel, or if it is indeed a buggy
scenario where DMA is happening into an address it shouldn't
really be overwriting.

Yes, this is indeed what we need eventually.	
What would it take to get there ? The main difficulty is making
sure all device drivers do this ..
