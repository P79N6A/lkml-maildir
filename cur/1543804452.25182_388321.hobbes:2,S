This code operates on the assumption that offset is always 0 for the
pages == BITS_PER_LONG case. It's calculated in this order:
        unsigned int pages = 1 << order;
        int i;
        int span = (pages + (BITS_PER_LONG - 1)) / BITS_PER_LONG;
        if (pages > BITS_PER_LONG)
                pages = BITS_PER_LONG;
...
        for (i = 0; i < bits; i += pages) {
                int index = i/BITS_PER_LONG;
                int offset = i - (index * BITS_PER_LONG);
...
So in the case of pages >= BITS_PER_LONG the mask will be 0xffffffff, and
offset will be 0, and the span will define how many adjacent words we
need to set. Unless I'm missing something, I don't see how your case
would happen. I did test this quite a bit mixing both tiny and large
orders.
