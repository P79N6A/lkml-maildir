And C specifies that a pointer to foo, will point to a real object of type foo, so gcc can't be blamed for the unsafe typecasts. I have tested this the hard way, so this is not just speculation.

I get the sensation we're violently in agreement here, just misunderstanding each other. :)
_My_ point was that the documentation should mention that normal, unpacked C objects have alignments that influence the code generated by __builtin_memcpy(). As such, one should always make sure to have either src or dst be char*/void* when alignment cannot be guaranteed. The example in the documentation has this, but it isn't explicit that this is required.
