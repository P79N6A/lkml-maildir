Any code that uses select() on the same file-descriptor
for several threads is broken. You can't explain away
a select() problem with a bad-coding example. Somebody
else responded that a bad checksum could do the same
thing --not. Select must return correct information.
The user-code doesn't know about, doesn't care, and
in many cases can't find out about, the inner workings
of an operating system.
When a function call like select() says there are data
available, there must be data available, period. If
not, it's broken and needs to be fixed. Requiring
one to set sockets to non-blocking is a poor work-
around for an otherwise fatal flaw.
