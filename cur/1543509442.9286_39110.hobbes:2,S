Hi! This probably has been mentioned before, but what the heck.
Users of GnuPG often are baffled of why does its executable have to be
suid root or else it gives ominous warnings about "insecure memory". The
reason is the memory it allocates for sensitive data (like a user's
passphrase) might be copied to the swap partition and thus be vulnerable
to a moderately sophisticated attack. To make a region of memory
un-swappable, one uses the mlock(2) call, which only root has the right
to use. Hence the suid.
Couldn't there be a kernel option (maybe tunable by /proc/something)
through wich the kernel could grant a limited amount of mlock-able
memory for each non-root process? This could default to 0 but be
increased when sensitive software is being used.
