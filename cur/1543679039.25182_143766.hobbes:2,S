Subject: [BUG]Kernel 2.4.21: EHCI does not repeat keys

Hello World,
My PS/2 keyboard is connected to my ladptop via a PS/2 to USB converter
(My laptop has no PS/2 port and there is no USB variant of my keyboard).
I have USB2.0, so I tried the EHCI. Unfortunately, the keys are not
repeated when I keep my finger on a key. This works perfectly with the
UHCI module.
Kernel 2.4.21 Debian GNU/Linux unstable
Best regards
	Andreas
