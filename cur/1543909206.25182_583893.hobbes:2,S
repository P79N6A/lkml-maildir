Christoph,
Can we revert git commit 3cdc0ed0cea50ea08dd146c1bbc82b1bcc2e1b80 ?
This is introducing a performance regression and nullifies the previous
commit.

    [PATCH] x86-64: skip cache_free_alien() on non NUMA
    Set use_alien_caches to 0 on non NUMA platforms.  And avoid calling the
    cache_free_alien() when use_alien_caches is not set.  This will avoid the
    cache miss that happens while dereferencing slabp to get nodeid.
Looking at the 3cdc0ed0cea50ea08dd146c1bbc82b1bcc2e1b80 changelog, I can't find
enough info of why cache_free_alien() must be called regardless if we use alien
caches or not.
Appended patch fixes the performance regression. Please  comment the need
for 3cdc0ed0cea50ea08dd146c1bbc82b1bcc2e1b80, if I miss something.
thanks,
suresh

Skip calling cache_free_alien() when alien caches are not used.
This will avoid cache misses that happen while accessing slabp (which
is per page memory  reference) to get nodeid. Instead use a global
variable to skip the call, which is mostly likely to be present in the
cache.
This gives a 0.8% performance boost with the database oltp workload
on a quad-core SMP platform and by any means the number is not small :)
