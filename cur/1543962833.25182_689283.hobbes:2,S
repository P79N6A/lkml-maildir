I assume you have the .o file build somewhere as part of the
normal kernel build.
Then you in
arch/powerpc/Makefile adds the following assignment:
LDFLAGS_MODULE += arch/powerpc/lib/my_magic_file.o
kbuild will then during the modpost stage link this
file on all modules.
To add the same file to the kernel just include it
in a obj-y += my_magic_file.o
One trap is that my_magic_file.o needs to be built
for a modules build too.
I think you need to assign it to always:
   always := my_magic_file.o
to accomplish this.
So in the end we will have:
arch/powerpc/Makefile:
LDFLAGS_MODULE += arch/powerpc/lib/my_magic_file.o
arch/powerpc/lib/Makefile:
always := my_magic_file.o
obj-y += my_magic_file.o
Let me know if this does address your question.
