I like the chroot idea too.
Are we going to chroot from the kernel level (eg. the atomic snapshot
ioctl()) or from within the suspending utility?
I think the kernel level would protect some people from bugs in their own
suspending utilities, but then we'd have to mount the tmpfs from the kernel
level as well.
Greetings,
