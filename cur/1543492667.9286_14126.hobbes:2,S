Hi!

People/old programs do not realize that sticky bit means elevated
privileges. Which is bad from backwards-compatibility point of
view. I.e. I go to my sysadmin and ask him to set sticky on one of my
executables. He'll do so.

You do not want this kind of support in kernel. Believe me. Better use
setuid0 as marker (those are already immutable) and userspace suid
program which implements your CAP_SETFCAP.
