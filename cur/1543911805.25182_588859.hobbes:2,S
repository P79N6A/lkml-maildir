Subject: [patch 00/28] Add cmpxchg64_local and cmpxchg_local to each architecture

Hi Andrew,
Here is the patch series for 2.6.23-rc3-mm1 that adds cmpxchg_local, and now
also cmpxchg64_local, to each architecture.
When the architecture supports it, it also defines cmpxchg64, but is is not
defined for architecture that does not support atomic 64 bits updates.
Following performance testing of the slub allocator with cmpxchg_local, these
patches should prove themselves useful in a near future.
Mathieu
