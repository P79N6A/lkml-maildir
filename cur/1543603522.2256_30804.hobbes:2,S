I dont think youve followed the discussions too well and normally i
wouldnt respond but you addressed me. Ingos netdevice polling is not the
right approach, please look at NAPI and read the paper. NAPI does
all what youve been suggesting. We are not even discussing that at this
point. We are discussing the sledgehammer effect and how you could break a
finger or two trying to kill that fly with it. The example above
illustrates it.
