The standard says that select should return when the operation against the 
fd would not block *or* would return an error different from 
would-have-blocked. The following operation on a closed fd would be an 
EBADF, that fits the standard description. OTOH, MT is messy. Consider a 
thread that closes the fd and immediately after open another one having 
the same fd#. Bottom line is, don't do it.
