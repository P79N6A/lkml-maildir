Hi all, 
I wanted to test 2.5 kernels, but i have to say that i have no clue
about the current status of the drivers that use.
I checked dmesg to see what info it gave me and it just pushes loads of
error messages as seen below.... The only thing i have on that scsi
interface is two cdroms (one of which is a cd writer).
Is this known? Any information you guys want/need?
lspci:
00:0b.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AHA-7850 (rev 03)
driver:
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX=y
driver options:
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE=8
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY_MS=15000
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_ENABLE=y (shouldn't print all this data if it
				wasn't important imho.)
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_MASK=0
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT=y
dmesg is filled with:
scsi0: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr = 0x7
scsi0: Data Parity Error Detected during address or write data phase
scsi0: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr = 0x9
scsi0: Data Parity Error Detected during address or write data phase
CC since i don't think i could handle subscribing to this ml =)
