Hello,
I tried Linux 2.2.0-pre8 (prepatch .../testing/pre-8.gz ) a had
a kind of lock up of the system.
There were big processes around, an X server that had grown to 32MB
due to my previous use of many TrueType fonts, a gimp of about 24MB
and some others. And I had a backup with tar running, that 
would continuously transfer from disk to tape. The backup was running
in an iconified window. The disk and tape are on the same SCSI-bus,
and the tape is slow (300K/sec).
After some time all the X applications running would no longer respond,
but I could still move the mouse and switch to a textmode-console.
So at least the X-server was not locked. I then tried to login
at text-console. I could enter user and password but could not
progress to a shell-prompt. The backup (tar) was running fine
all this time. Since I did not want to interrupt the backup
with a reboot I waited for the backup to complete hoping that
all would return to normal. Some time later (20-30 minutes)
the tape stopped, but otherwise nothing changed. I pressed
Alt-Sysreq-s to sync, and that said something like
'Syncing device 08:04' and stuck there.
Normally it prints:
Syncing device 08:04 ... OK
Syncing device 08:01 ... OK
Syncing device 08:03 ... OK
So rebooted 'Alt-Sysreq-r' and had a few minor repairs in the
filesystem.
The system is based on Dual-PentiumII, 233MHz,
Gigabyte GA-686LX2 motherboard. The kernel is compiled with
gcc version egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release).
