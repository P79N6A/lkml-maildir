Huh?  We still need something like sysfs_get_dentry to find the dentries
for the rename or move operation.  So we can call d_move.  
Further we should be talking about sysfs_move_dir not sysfs_rename_dir
as only the networking code calls sysfs_rename_dir.  Not that it is
significantly different.
I think I saw a change in lock ordering recently to help distributed
filesystems, and maybe that will simplify some of this.
Anyway I figure if I am to understand this I better go look and see if
I can find the start of this thread.  I don't have a clue
where we are blowing up.
