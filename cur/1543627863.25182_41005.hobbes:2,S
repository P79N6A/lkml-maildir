Why's that?  Don't they compliment each other, or is mdadm a replacement?
If it's not a replacement, combining it with raidtools2 would probably get
it into distributions faster and people have already been taught with
countless how-tos that you need the raidtools package...
Hmm, checking now debian has already packaged mdadm for debian 3.0 (woody),
so raidtools just may become obsoleted so my argument is probably moot...
ehh, what's one more message on lkml anyway? ;)
