Subject: Commit "[PATCH] USB: Always do usb-handoff" breaks my   powerbook
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

My G4 powerbook gets a machine check on boot as a result of commit
478a3bab8c87a9ba4a4ba338314e32bb0c378e62.  Putting a return at the
start of quirk_usb_early_handoff fixes it.
The code in quirk_usb_handoff_ohci looks rather bogus in that it
doesn't do pci_enable_device before trying to access the device.
Paul.
