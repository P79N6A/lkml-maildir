OK..
We used to have
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_ANY_ID, quirk_via_irq);
and we now have
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C586_0, quirk_via_irq);
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C586_1, quirk_via_irq);
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C586_2, quirk_via_irq);
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C586_3, quirk_via_irq);
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C686, quirk_via_irq);
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C686_4, quirk_via_irq);
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C686_5, quirk_via_irq);
which is rather a step backwards, because we need to keep that list updated
now, and we'll fail to catch new devices.
What happens if we just revert 75cf7456dd87335f574dcd53c4ae616a2ad71a11?
It says
    Alan Cox pointed out that the VIA 'IRQ fixup' was erroneously running
    on my system which has no VIA southbridge (but I do have a VIA IEEE
    1394 device).
but so what?  Did anything actually go wrong?  Is it likely to go wrong in
the future?
Is there was a problem, is there something we can do at runtime in
quirk_via_irq() to avoid the problem, rather than expanding out the fixup
list in this manner?
