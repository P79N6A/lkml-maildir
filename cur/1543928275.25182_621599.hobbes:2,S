thanks, it looks good - but the fact that we are at v4 of the patchset 
underlines the point that this is more of a v2.6.25 patchset than a 
v2.6.24 one. Group fairness certainly works fine enough in most setups 
and we are late into the v2.6.24 -rc stage. We'll merge this patchset 
(or any later versions of it) into v2.6.25 for sure, so distros that 
happen to base things off v2.6.24 can pick up your patches just fine.
