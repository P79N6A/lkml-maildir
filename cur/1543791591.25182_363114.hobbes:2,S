Hi Roman,
Thank you for all of your feedback.  It is much appreciated.  Also, I
apologize for not getting back to you sooner; I got held up on a lot
of stuff at work.

Here is an updated patch for the updated 2.6.14 kernel.  Please note,
however, that I have not done any cleanup because I wanted to know
your opinion, first.  Would you rather I try to format my changes
the same as the *original* lxdialog style, or include the styling changes
in a separate patch and leave my formatting the way it is?  I realize
that it's usually against common curtesy to modify the style, so I'll
take whatever advise you can give me on this.
