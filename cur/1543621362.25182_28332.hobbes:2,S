Hi Damien
The current stack size is obtainable from /proc/pid/status (VmStk). 
If you need the VM addresses you need to make a hack, but you can start
by looking at the code for generation the status:
fs/proc/array.c:task_mem()
Note that with in C (gcc) you can get a hold of a bit of info:
see info gcc
	-> C extentions -> return address -> Getting the Return or Frame
Address of a Function
You can also use asm statement in C to inspect the stack, but you need
to do assembly....
 
The latter you get from /proc/.../maps and /status, and /statm (see man
proc)
also: ps -u -p pid 
VSZ is the virtual memory size, RSS is what is resident in phys memory. 
THreads is a bit trickier.
