you are right, a spin_trylock_irqsave() call would be much cleaner.
i think i should explain why you are seeing such hacks in the PREEMPT_RT 
patch: generally we are trying to achieve near-100% driver API 
compatibility (that of course is also one of the requirements for any of 
this to hit mainline), so i'm marking any deviations with _nort or _rt 
postfixes (depending on where the change in semantics is needed). I 
consider them temporary hacks, so i'm usually trying to keep the 
original form of the code, so that i can go back later and fix it.
I had these hacks in tg3.c for some time, and i thought i could drop 
them now that local_irq_*() uses the soft IRQ-flag - but i was wrong.  
One example of the _rt/_nort marking process is e.g. the earlier RCU API 
related grossness, which went away with Paul's PREEMPT_RCU aproach and 
now PREEMPT_RT is fully compatible with the RCU API. Fortunately, 
assymetric local_irq_* + spin_lock_* uses (which are perfectly legal!)  
are relatively rare. Extending the spinlock APIs and converting all 
upstream code would be a good approach to solve this problem, as it's 
also a cleanup. (It would probably also make static lock analysis 
easier.)
