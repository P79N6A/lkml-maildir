i believe libgpio uses the existing usb/iee1394/serial/parallel
interfaces to provide a limited userspace driver capability.  gphoto2
uses this to support a LOT of digital cameras entirely in userspace...
obviously this concept isn't covering everything but it sure covers a
lot of bases.  also depends on what you understand a "driver" to be...
from a "common user"'s perspective it just means "it makes my WinWidget
work!"
it's similar to what you describe above in that there's a kernel
interface, but it's more specific than /dev/irq5.  this is good in that
you don't want a different usb driver for every userspace usb device
driver...
