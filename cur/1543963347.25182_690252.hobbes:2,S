For old CPUs it is actually ok (after all they worked for years without
PAT), I just don't like it for new CPUs. It's a bad idea there and
in the x86 world it is a reasonable expectation that CPU features
generally work.
That said I am not aware of that many PAT erratas even on old CPUs.
There are a few, but they are known and well understood and could
well be black listed.
