Yes, but for IPv4/6 it's not an issue.  Some implementations might
handle all-zeros and the spec _currently_ calls for it.  In this case an
alignment would be good.
I guess I'll just go ahead and file a problem report with the spec.
Maybe the Unix vendors will test their implementations in provide feedback.
