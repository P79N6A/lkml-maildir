've posted to this group before about how my Redhat 6.0 system
goes down every few days with dire error messages (like "Aiee !  system
panic...).
I ran diagnostics on my machine and it passed all tests. At the same
time,
our departmental Sun systems (Ultrasparc servers) slow down to a crawl
--- and it
turned out that some hackers are attacking our systems with pings and
telnets (a packet sniffer disclosed that our high-speed network is
completely saturated by pings, ftp's and telnets from a few sources.
The question is: how do I prevent these attacks from crashing my Linux
system?
(Disconnecting from the network is not an option...). They slow down
Solaris
systems (during the attack itself) but don't kill them off. Our system
adminstrator
said that the Linux kernel is full of race conditions that cause it to
crash under these circumstances...
Is there some way to reconfigure my system to make it less vulnerable?
