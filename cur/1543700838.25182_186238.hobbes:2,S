I've a long standing problem with 2.5/2.6 kernel series. My
mouse sometimes moving weird under X. In the syslog I found
related kernel message:
Dec 25 23:31:04 yavin4 kernel: psmouse.c: Mouse at
isa0060/serio4/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes
away.
It seems the problem related gkrellm+apm. If the gkrellm
running the mouse weird moving oftener.
My machine an IBM Thinkpad R32. The problem continously
exist from 2.5.70 -> 2.6.0-mm1.
Any idea? 
Thanks for your attention. 
Max.
