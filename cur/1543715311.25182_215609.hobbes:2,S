Subject: [PATCH] psmouse: fix mouse hotplugging
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/22/41

Note to myself: make small patches not big confusing ones.
This patch fixes hotplugging of PS/2 devices on hardware which don't
support hotplugging of PS/2 devices. In other words, most desktop machines.
Applies to at least 2.6.5, 2.6.6, 2.6.6-rc2 and 2.6.6-rc2-mm1.
