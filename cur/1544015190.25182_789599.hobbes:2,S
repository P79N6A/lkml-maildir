Subject: [PATCH 0/5] [trivial] Fix dubious bitwise and/or usage.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello.
Sorry to bother the lkml with such trivial stuff, but
I could not get any response from either Jiri Kosina
ot trivial@ when I sent the patches directly to them.
Maybe a linux-trivial@ mailing list would be a good idea..
These patches fix a number of cases where &/| were by
mistake used instead of &&/||. In every single case the
semantics stays the same, so none is a real bug.
