Hi Linus,
Andrea sent another patch to correct a problem with i/o bound processes,
which he also posted to linux-kernel.  The performance in this test is
unchanged.
Here are the results:
2.1.131-ac11                                    172 sec  
2.2.0-pre1 + Arcangeli's 1st patch              400 sec
test1-pre  + Arcangeli's 2nd patch              119 sec 
test1-pre  + Arcangeli's 3rd patch              119 sec
test1-pre  + Arcangeli's 3rd patch              117 sec 
(changed to priority = 9 in mm/vmscan.c)
2.2.0-pre3                                      175 sec
2.2.0-pre3 + Linus's patch                      129 sec
RH5.2 Stock (2.0.36-0.7)                        280 sec
I noticed that in watching the 'vmstat 1' during the test that
'2.2.0+Linus patch' was not *quite* as smooth as the Archangeli patches,
in that there were periods of 2 or 3 seconds in which the swap out rate
would fall to ~800k/sec and then jump back up to 1.8-2.5MB/sec.  I have
only run your patch once though.  I'll check it further tomorrow to
confirm that that is really the case.  Note how much better 2.2 is doing
compared to 2.0.36-0.7 in this situation.
I should be available for a good part of this weekend for further
testing; Just let me know.
As a reference:
AMD K6-2 300
128MB ram
2GB seagate scsi2 dedicated to swap
Data drive is 6.5GB UDMA
