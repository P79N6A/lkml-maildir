And that effort is still going on.  Daniel and Pavel have been trying
to find a good algorithm for detecting and fixing misconfigured TI
interrupt routing, and this effort is still on-going.
What would be useful is if Silla could test some of Daniel's patches
and provide feedback.
The latest 2.6 patch from Daniel is at:
	
http://ritz.dnsalias.org/linux/pcmcia-ti-routing-9.patch
and I'll ask that feedback is sent to linux-pcmcia and not as a reply
to this message (I'm just monitoring what's going on at present.)
Essentially, this patch needs to be well tested before it goes into
mainline.
