Subject: ntfs dies on grep w/ 2.2.10

Sometimes I should not try to trick with neat
things found on lkml. I mounted an ntfs partition
and cd'd to winnt. The command line
grep -i copyright *|strings
resulted in an instant reboot.
Later I tried running a little different
cmd line, this time the cwd being on an ext2
partition. I ran
grep -i copyright /mnt/t/WINNT/*.dll|strings
and the machine locked. Ok, I know that I'm
doing something stupid here but I don't know
exactly what that might be, modulo the idea
of messing with ntfs anyway. Oh, there weren't
any log entries, so it died pretty quickly.
Mystical, sez me.
