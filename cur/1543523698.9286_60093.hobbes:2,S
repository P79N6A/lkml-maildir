Hi,
linux-2.3.40 has a problem fscking. It results in a lot of short reads, leading
to fs corruption if left alone. Interrestingly the first inode it happened on
was always the same. IMHO this is a potential serious problem.
This happened on a IDE disk, via chipset, K6 processor, UP.
2.3.37 worked flawlessly.
	Regards
