It does not matter what the UID contain and how it is generated. The focus 
now should be to verify that different UIDs do not see other UIDs pages. 
Once that is verified to be true, and if SeLinux actually wants to use 
it, we'll find a way so that the other 99% of Linux users won't pay the 
price of the abstraction needed to accomplish what they need for this to 
work for them. Ok?
