the question is not about which one consumes more in "real life".
The question is "which of the resources are allocated on user demand
and should be limited for the environment to be secure and isolated".

I also claim that reclaiming some of kernel pages is almost undoable :)
Look, the page can be used by slab objects from 2 different containers.
Why one container should suffer from the second one which needs to be reclaimed?
What to do? separate allocators per container? And if you want to reclaim
say a page with vma you need to replaces tons of pointers all over the objects
in SMP safe manner.
 That might generally be true, but I have one example that's

because you suggest the same limit for pagetables and user memory.
Thats why we have separate kmemsize limit for kernel objects and privvmpages for
user memory.
privvmpages limit hit will result in -ENOMEM on mmap() system call,
which is memory friendly.
