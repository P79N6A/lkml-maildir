I am not running udftools. In fact it isn't even installed (not part of
Slackware 10.1).  I'm trying to burn an iso9660 on a CDR using cdrecord.
There seems to be issues with CD burning under 2.6.11. I make an iso, and I
burn it to CDR with 2.6.11 and again with 2.4.28 on the same laptop/same DVD
+RW drive. The disk burnt under 2.4 is fine, md5sums all ok, can be read
under both kernels. The disk burnt under 2.6.11 burns without error from
cdrecord/k3b/etc, but afterwards is not readable under 2.6.11. It is readable
under 2.4.28, but the md5sums are not 100% correct, basically making 2.6.11
useless for making backups to CDR.
