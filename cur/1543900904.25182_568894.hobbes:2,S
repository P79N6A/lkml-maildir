Gidday,
I recently released man-pages-2.62.
This release is now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
and soon at:
    
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages
This release consists solely of formatting fixes; there are no changes to
content.
Cheers,
Michael
