You are missing the point.
You have one totally made-up example of something that may happen as a 
result of a default I didn't even advocate (but you didn't read my email). 
And you use that as an argument against another case that wasn't even made 
up, but a real issue where suspend simply didn't work, because the /home 
partition no longer worked afterwards.
There really was nothing theoretical in my issue. On a certain class of 
hardware, you absolutely _have_ to make your /home or / partition be 
behind a USB thing, because nothing else has enough space on it.
And your made-up example wouldn't even trigger if we just made a per-mount 
decision to mark devices persistent.
So why are you arguing?
