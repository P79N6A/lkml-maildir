This is due to a bug in kernel/sys.c in the function
notifier_chain_unregister().
where the 'notifier_lock' can't be acquired while reboot is running.
I suspect any other drivers that call this function on shutdown from 
unregister_reboot_notifier() (in the case where the root filesystem is
mounted 
through the driver will also have this problem), i.e. DAC960.c (Mylex) and
gdth.c (ICP).
The fix for now is to modify kernel/sys.c, the function
"notifier_chain_unregister",
and remove the write_lock(&notifier_lock), and write_unlock(&notifier_lock)
calls
from this function and recompile your kernel.

Subject: Bug in 3w-xxxx.c
Hi,
i have discovered a problem with a 3ware 5400 controller inside my SMP
system (Dual PIII800, kernel 2.4.0-test7, 3w-xxxx.c version 1.02.00.002). 
Problem: 
	System will not reboot or halt. Last message on console comes form
	within 3w-xxxx.c.
Solution: 
	remove call to function unregister_reboot_notifier() in function
        tw_halt() solves the problem.
Regards,
Frank Koeck
