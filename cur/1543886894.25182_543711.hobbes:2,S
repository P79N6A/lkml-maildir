Ah, I see.  We spawn a kernel thread from a code path that belongs to a
user space task and we need to call deamonize() to make it become a
'real' kernel thread.
Still, this means that is_user_space() may return 'true' for this thread
before it calls daemonize() and then the scenario described by me in the
previous message may occur.  It seems.

Well, I have no (better) idea ...

I think we can avoid the above scenario (in which a kernel thread that has
called daemonize() "too late" ends up with TIF_FREEZE set and goes to
refrigerator() while we're freezing the user space).

It's in freezer-fix-pf_nofreeze-vs-freezeable-race.patch (appended for
convenience, white space may be broken).
Greetings,
