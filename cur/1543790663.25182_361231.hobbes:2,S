Is the compiler really that smart as it searches back into the parent-function and try all the combinations? Otherwise, Arnd is correct.
And on an philosophical plane, can/should we put that responsibility onto the compiler? Is it not "easier" to make the functions take care
of its own duties (like the *nix-way) and make the bvec_alloc_bs initialize idx (even if it has to be an error-value)?
I'm thinking something like this. Seems alright?
