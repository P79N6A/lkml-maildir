I have a Megaherz card as well. It has been working fine ever since
Linus fixed some issues with the ToPIC97 Cardbus controller. It reports
a 16550A on my machine.
I have been using the card to connect to my ISP day-in and day-out with
no problems.
If you want me to run some specific test on this box let me know.

PS: I have everything compiled into the kernel.
