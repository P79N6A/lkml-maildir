Hi Linus,
3 patches for s390, just minor stuff. Arnd is working on the compat ioctls
which are broken for s390 right now, and we have started working on the 3270
driver which is in a bad shape.
Short descriptions:
1) Various s390 bug fixes. 
2) Optimze s390 inline assemblies.
3) Remove remaining MOD_INC_USE_COUNT/MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT pairs from s390 code.
blue skies,
  Martin.
