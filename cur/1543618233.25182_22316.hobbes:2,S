hi
I have this driver (intel e1000) that I need into kernel. I cannot use
initrd here, as the computer is supposed to boot up on the network,
something that doesn't work very well without having one.
Is there a nice way of putting this driver into kernel? Intel only ships
it as a module.
Thanks for any help.
