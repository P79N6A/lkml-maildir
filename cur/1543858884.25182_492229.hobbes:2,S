Enable CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G or CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G.

Yes 'fixes' it.
But such a change seems bogus to me. You are 
using VMALLOC_END, hence you should include the .h file which contains 
VMALLOC_END, and nothing more. Of course there are exceptions to this 
(like getting at elevator.h's stuff by means of inclusion of blkdev.h)
