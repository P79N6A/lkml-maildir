I've never advocated that you should put such data into a single
file. I've said that before and I'll say it again. The example you
raise is just one in a large space.
All I am saying is that for some kinds of data (such as a single,
large growing component and any number of small maybe growing
components), storing it in a special file is fine. It's been done and
it works well. I have already said that this case does not apply in
general.

Yes.

No, I didn't suggest that. Again, I favour optional extensions to new
and existing tools, so that you can view albods as either atomic or as
conventional directories. Make the default behaviour configurable on a
per-user basis (~/.resource-file) and allow that default to be
overridden on a per-execution basis.

That doesn't matter. If GUI developers can't agree to use a common
library, it does not follow that the functionality should be pushed
into the kernel/libc.

No they won't. Each user can edit ~/.albodrc. Generic luser has:
CMD_LINE_MODE=cooked
GUI_MODE=cooked
but power users are free to do:
CMD_LINE_MODE=raw
GUI_MODE=cooked
Everybody gets all 4 possibilities. Or you can just make it a single
option that applies to the command-line and to GUIs. Doesn't matter.
The point is everybody can be catered to with this scheme. Hacking the
kernel/libc *prevents* a *legitimate* mode of operation. That is
simply unacceptable.

I don't work the way you do. I want raw mode at the command
line. Always. I should not be prevented from doing that.

NO! I want *all* my existing tools to be unaffected. I don't want the
semantics changed. But I'm quite happy for another user on the machine
to use cooked mode.

I'm afraid of having different semantics shoved down my throat.
Actually, I'm not afraid, I'll just rip such nastiness out of my
system, and if necessary maintain and distribute a kernel patch if
that's what it takes.
The difference between devfs and kernel space albods is that with
devfs I provide choice. There are a range of operating modes that
users are free to use (and I note that some devfs detractors are
effectively trying to prevent me (i.e. any user who just wants to
download a kernel from Linus and not patch it) from having the full
range of choice).
With kernel space albods, I don't get the choice of having all my
tools work in raw mode. This is why I'm fundamentally opposed to
them. The key point is that I support the availability of new
semantics but I oppose the restriction of existing ones.

That's not true. They may have gif files, for example. And the headers
are somewhere in the albod directory.

I have a range of tools I can use to create text. The simplest is
<cat>. I don't need a special API to write text.

??? I'm talking about system utilities, ls, sed, awk, perl, tr plus a
whole bunch of my own custom utilities.
