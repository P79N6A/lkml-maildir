dentry_cache drops a little bit, but the vast majority stays.
sock_inode_cache I didn't notice drop.  If I don't reboot every
15/20mins the machine suddenly starts thrashing like mad and then
effectively locks up :-(
Last night I tried reverting the dvb-core ringbuffer part of -mm1 and
that didn't seem to help at all.  
I've just tried 2.6.16 with just the origin.patch from -mm1 and that
has the same leak in it.   So it looks like I should have spotted this
earlier before it was pushed into 2.6.16+  Just double checked and
in 2.5.16 sock_inode_cache isn't even on the slabtop screen.
I suppose that leads to a new question - what's the easiest way to
start to break down origin.patch and do you know of any likely
culprits?  I see Andi Kleen has seen dentry_cache leaking on x86_64
(this machine is x86(_32) uni processor. 
Thanks for your help,
Adrian
