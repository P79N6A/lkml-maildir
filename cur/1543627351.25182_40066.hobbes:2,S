I did not have a /dev/hdg.  I searched and found your emails to
linux-kernel regarding your findings on quirks with the PDC20265
controller and moved /dev/hdh to /dev/hdg 
I've not had a single DMA error since, regardless of how much I've tried
to break things.  Previously I was able to fail things within a few
minutes.
Thank you!
At this point I am racking these issues against hardware quirks of my
A7V's onboard controller... I cannot say that there is anything amiss in
the kernel (or with reiserfs) in the light these findings.
