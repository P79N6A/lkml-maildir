The nfsd threads called cache_clean() from nfsd() in nfsd/nfssvc.c,
whenever they didn't have anything else to do, but this wasn't really
often enough.  You could probably get them to do it after every
request as cache_clean() does virtually nothing unless there is
evidence that something needs doing.
