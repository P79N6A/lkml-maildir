I've simply identified that MPOL_BIND mempolicy interactions with a task's 
changing mems_allowed as a result of a cpuset move or mems change is also 
an issue that can be addressed at the same time as the interleave problem.  
And it can be done with the addition of a single MPOL_F_* flag.

The issues of mempolicies working over memoryless nodes and supporting 
changing cpusets are very closely related and can be addressed in the same 
way.  It would be disappointing to see a lot of work done to fix the 
memoryless node issue or the changing cpuset mems issue and then realize 
both could have been fixed quite simply with a relatively small set of 
changes.
