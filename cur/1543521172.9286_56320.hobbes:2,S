Development work on token ring only started up again last spring and we have managed to provide drivers for several new cards,  implement multicast, preliminary IPv6 support and rewritten the source routing code to make token ring more efficient. Work is continuing on more drivers and updating the main token ring code to handle the latest standards.
ATTENTION ALL KERNEL DEVELOPERS INTRESTED IN TOKEN RING:
I have ~20 4/16mbit ISA IBM token ring cards available at zero cost to
anyone sincerly intrested in token ring development. (No MAUs though). 
I'll provide model numbers opon request. Just drop me an email if some of
these would be of use.
