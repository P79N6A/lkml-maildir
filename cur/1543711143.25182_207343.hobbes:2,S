Hi Andrew,
This patch adds a comment to "Documentation/SubmittingDrivers"
about the importance of adding a Copyright notice in submitted code.
The parisc-linux port has neglected this in the past and I've
been slowly trying to correct that (along with proper GPL header).
While I make it sound like GPL is the "only" acceptable license,
I'll leave it up to lawyers to determine what other appropriate
license could be used for a new driver.
thanks,
grant
