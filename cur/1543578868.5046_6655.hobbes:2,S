Sorry , can't get it until saturday :-(
fdisk reports the disk geometry as 3xxxxx/xx/xx which probably LARGE.
I don't remember the start/stop cylinders of partitions.
Is there a way to change the geometry from fdisk ?
I tried expert mode and 'set sectors' and 'set heads',
but after I exit fdisk with 'w' , it is unchanged.
