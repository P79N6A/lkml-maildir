No, it wasn't *necessary*:  you made a choice that not confusing your
customers was more important to you than not increasing the support
burden on kernel developers by releasing a silently tainted module
into the wild.
That might make sense from your business perspective, but you must
accept its consequences: anger from those you've inconvenienced for
your benefit.  There's no reason they should give a fuck if your
customers are confused or not.

No, it's only clear if someone looks at the module's source (what's
available of it), in which case the license would presumably be clear
from comments or documentation anyway.  The main purpose of the
MODULE_LICENSE() macro is to label the *module binary* with the
license.  To the standard tools that look at it there, it says "GPL"
which is clearly misleading.
