David,
	Please consider pulling from my git tree:
	git-pull git://lost.foo-projects.org/~ppwaskie/git/net-2.6.22
multiqueue
This is a branch named 'multiqueue' of a recent pull from your tree with
an updated implementation of the multiqueue implementation we've been
working on.  Included in this is:
1) A simplified API where all drivers will allocate a queue struct for
each queue on the NIC.
2) A transparent stack change for both non-mq and mq devices to use the
same codepath.
3) Remove the per-queue locking model, and just use the per-queue
netif_{start|stop|wake}_subqueue() functions for multiqueue management.
4) Updated multiqueue documentation in Documentation/networking
describing the implementation and base driver requirements to implement
multiqueue support.
Cheers,
