First I wish to thank very much those who wrote the 'Per partition statistics in
/proc/partitions' patch, now available in 2.4.20. It is a very useful feature IMHO.
I am using it to write a new module for the modular monotoring software moodss
(
http://jfontain.free.fr/moodss/
).
Now, from /proc/partitions, I can find the number of blocks per partition or
disk, but what I also need is the size of each disk, or the block size of each
disk, so that I could display the size in bytes for each disk, which would be
more user friendly.
Is there a way to find that information within the /proc filesystem or by any
other mean (that has to work for any disk type (IDE, SCSI, USB, ...)).
Many thanks in advance and sorry for posting here, but I really need expert
advice...
Happy New Year,
Jean-Luc (jfontain@free.fr)
