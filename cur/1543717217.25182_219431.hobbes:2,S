which results in the same as if we set NULL for the private pointer when
we claim the second interface. If this really happens then we have more
problems in the driver itself, because this case won't be handled in
either way. However I don't think that this will happen, because for
Bluetooth devices interface 0 and 1 can be seen as a unit. The only
reason that this was split over two interfaces, was that you don't have
to stop the bulk transfers when you change the altsetting on the second
interface.

Marcel
