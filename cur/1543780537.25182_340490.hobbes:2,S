Well, refcounting _might_ be useful for some usage of these, but we
simply must make sure that those pages are never returned back to the
pool when refcount reach 0, that's it.

Well, a refcounting bug would let them be freed and kaboom ... That's
why a "PG_not_your_ram_dammit" bit would be useful. It could at least
BUG_ON when refcount reaches 0 :)

Yes.

It is a different topic indeed. Wli proposal would be useful for us
here, but in the meantime, We can just create struct pages and rely on
sparsemem to have a not-too-horrible mem_map :)
