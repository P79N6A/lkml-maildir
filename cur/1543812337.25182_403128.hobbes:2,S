Ok, if I understand you correctly now, there is a function defined in
another part of the kernel, which is _called_ by AF_UNIX, and it is for
this function that the other part of the kernel must export a symbol?
But you only need to do this so that modules can use the function,
because if, instead, the driver is built in, then the function is
directly in scope, and can be called explicitly?
