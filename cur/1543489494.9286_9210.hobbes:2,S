Hello,
I'm trying to figure out what the differences is in the way IRQ's are
handled between
2.2.0 and 2.2.2... I haven't tried 2.2.1 or 2.2.3 so I don't know how they
fit in to the
picture, but when I call request_irq() it says it succeeds in 2.2.2 but then
the handler
is never called when that IRQ is generated by the hardware.  With everything
exactly the same, it works under 2.2.0.  Both were compiled with all the
default config options.  It
only occurs on certain systems.  What changed in the kernel?
