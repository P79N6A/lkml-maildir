Well, it seems I made my intention not very clear: I do not want You to
fix something in the driver, I just wanted from You to leave the old
ncr-driver in the kernel, just for the situation of a first install. I
think no newbie with little knowledge will be able to install Linux (or,
maybe, FreeBSD), when he happens to own such an controller. First, he
won't be able to read very much on the screen, for the loop runs much too
fast and second, he will not understand when he reads something about a
sym53c8xx. Exactly for this case I think the old driver should be left in.
If You want, You can tell him "Attention! Use of this driver deprecated.
Contact Your support." or whatever seems appropriate. It is just about the
first step to linuxland :-)
Hope I managed to make myself clear tris time
