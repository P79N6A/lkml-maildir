It's not about the number of the lines. For example, X86_64 and IA64
have to use the following ugly code:
+static struct swiotlb_phys_addr swiotlb_bus_to_phys_addr(char *dma_addr)
+{
+	int index = (dma_addr - io_tlb_start) >> IO_TLB_SHIFT;
+	struct swiotlb_phys_addr buffer = io_tlb_orig_addr[index];
+	buffer.offset += (long)dma_addr & ((1 << IO_TLB_SHIFT) - 1);
+	buffer.page += buffer.offset >> PAGE_SHIFT;
+	buffer.offset &= PAGE_SIZE - 1;
+	return buffer;
+}
Why do they suffers such code even if they don't need it at all?

I don't think so. Yes, modern 64-bit platforms tend to have hw IOMMUs
but I think that the majority don't use it. The modern I/O devices
(such as HBA) are capable of 64bit address DMA. So if you don't use
virtualization, you don't want IOMMU overheads (software and
hardware). So I think that 32-bit Xen is a fringe user of swiotlb.

If you read the patch (such as the above code), it unnecessarily adds
huge complicity to X86_64 and IA64. It just hurts stability,
readability and maintainability. There is no plus.
If multiple architectures need highmem in swiotlb, adding it to
lib/swiotlb.c makes sense. But what Xen people insist is, we should be
prepare for unlikely events, such as 'x86_64 would want to support
highmem' and they have no idea about who but we should be prepare for
someone who could use it.
I believe that adding ugly complicity to the generic code for unlikely
events is a bad idea.
I don't insist that Xen people need to duplicate all the swiotlb
code. It's fine to make it usable for x86. But I'm against adding the
code that only x86 uses to lib/swiotlb.c. That's should be in
arch/x86/pci-swiotlb_32.c. We already have
arch/x86/pci-swiotlb_64.c. If you add the code that only x86_32 use to
the generic library code (lib/swiotlb.c), why do we have
arch/x86/pci-swiotlb_64.c?
I know that you will merge the patchset anyway but I'm strongly
against the highmem patch.
