No - I want to run a test set with an M/O drive before and after the change
and see what it shows in real life. I suspect nothing much.

I don't think that should be required actually. The killer on M/O disks
is seek time, and to an extent rotational latency (its 3 trips round a 
cheaper M/O disk to rewrite a sector). If anything clustering writes to
the same track should be a big win.
