current 2.4 has no ssleep() nor jiffies_to_usecs() nor jiffies_to_msecs()
users. so no namespace conflicts on them.
i found a strange unsupported "msleep" syscall in
./arch/parisc/hpux/sys_hpux.c
left this one appart, i resend the msleep patch + 5 cleanup patches.
they remove duplicate msleep() or msecs_to_jiffies() definitions.
they are all compile tested, but the one touching drivers/char/shwdt.c
please show me if i forgot something.
