I won't be able to get at __cache_alloc() at least until Pekka Enberg
layers his "slab: consolidate allocation paths" patches on top of this
cpuset memory spread patchset.  Indeed, it might be Pekka who does more
for __cache_alloc() than me ... that has yet to play out.
The entangled, ifdef'd piece of code in mm/slab.c is more convoluted
than I can get my head around on this attempt, except for narrowly
focused changes.  Perhaps Pekka's work and another week will be enough.
