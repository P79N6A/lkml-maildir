I see the same problem with an IBM Thinkpad G40, and only when there is 
1Gb of memory or more in the machine.
The problem was reported the first time (to my knowledge), here:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0306.3/0956.html
by a Thinkpad T40 user.
So the problem seems to affect at least three different Thinkpad models.
The workaround I've seen so far have either been to disable 
pci_fixup_transparent_bridge (as mentioned in this thread) or to raise 
the value of pci_mem_start.
