Hi!
I recently updated two (old) hosts to 2.6.18-rc1, and started noticing
weird things with the nfs mounted /home s.
I frequently face EACCESs where a few minutes ago there wasn't any
problem, and after a retry everything does work again.
An example that easily trips it is keeping mutt open
on a single mailbox file (strace -tt| grep stat):
20:04:08.393815 stat64("mailbox", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=401000, ...}) = 0
20:08:41.859168 stat64("mailbox", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=401000, ...}) = 0
20:09:30.975876 stat64("mailbox", 0xbfe8966c) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
This results in a bit scary "Mailbox was corrupted!" message, but
otherwise harmless.  Reopening the mailbox succeeds immediately.
A sample session with an rsync session updating files on the nfs mounted
/home/:

I also think this is related in the dmesg.  Think, because there's no
other trace of any "read error" on the disks, and the comments in
mm/filemap.c (but the message is not that much help to be sure of this).

The relevant part of the /proc/mounts file:
-----
automount(pid1831) /home autofs rw 0 0
HOST:/export/PATH /home/path nfs rw,vers=3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,nolock,proto=udp,timeo=7,retrans=3,sec=sys,addr=HOST 0 0

How can I help with tracing this?  git bisecting on these machines takes
at least an hour per step, (and no reasonable connectivity either to
compile elsewhere much quicker).
