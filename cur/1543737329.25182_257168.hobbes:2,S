If you look at the motivation you'd then have to ask yourself why they
would want to do that given that a) They from the start said publically
"its using Linux" and b) Are dropping custom (well probably bought in
mostly) apps onto a generic reference platform.
Not only they seem to be behaving but I can see no obvious game
advantages for them to cheat.
One thing that certainly would be interesting as a thought experiment
for the legal bods (the real ones) would be what occurs if the license
on a couple of essential bits of the kernel was to say
	GPL v 2 blah bla 
	or you may choose to distribute the software without source
	code for $100,000 per product you ship it in.
This would then also give both a Judge and the thief a clear crystalised
value for damages....
