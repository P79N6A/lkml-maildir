Yes, you _potentially_ improve the unpredictability of /dev/urandom
without throwing out the guarantees of /dev/random. There is exactly
one difference between urandom and random - guaranteed entropy (ignore
for the moment that it's currently completely buggered, I'm fixing
that.). If you need guaranteed entropy, then you _need_ an
unobservable entropy source. Period. Pretending network interrupts are
unpredictable is just pretending.

If that's really true, then /dev/urandom is okay too, _by
definition_. Use it.
