Sounds right.  Well, actually, you need a shebang, as this would be
called from kernel space.
Speaking of which, how much speed is lost by starting up a process?
The idea of caching is that running
cat *; cat *; cat *; cat *; cat *
is probably slower than
cat * > baz; cat baz; cat baz; cat baz; cat baz; cat baz
The kernel is the right place to do such caching.  It is not the right
place to implement almost any kind of "cool new kind of file" that Hans
wants us to develop.

With two kernel reiser4 plugins -- one for files and one for
directories.  Others could come later, but I don't see this being so
important for things like symlinks.
Then, I'd let reiser4 cache things (in RAM and in free space on the
filesystem) which are generated through these plugins.
Directory plugins allow inheritence, too -- just have the plugin install
itself on all of its children.
Compression, encryption, etc. could all be done through the same mechanism.
