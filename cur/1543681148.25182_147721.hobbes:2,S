The bad assumption here is that this belongs in the OS.
Let me ask you this, how many modern scsi drivers have to speak every
piece of the SCSI bus protocol.  Or fibre channel?  All of it is
done on the cards, and that is what I think the iSCSI people should
be doing instead of putting garbage into the OS.
And I've presented a solution to the problem at the OS level that
doesn't require broken things like TOE and RDMA yet arrives at
the same solution.

You don't need to offload TCP, it's the segmentation and checksuming
that has the high cost not the actual TCP logic in the operating
system.
RDMA and TOE both add unnecessary complications.  My solution requires
no protocol changes, just smart hardware which needs to be designed
for any of the presented ideas anyways.
