Nope. Notice that "warned" dentries are not killed, but they are returned
to the list. If we meet them again - they are goners.
More formally, on each iteration you either decrement count or you
decrement the number of dentries that have DCACHE_REFERENCED. count
can't grow at all.  Number of dentries with DCACHE_REFERENCED can't grow
unless you release dcache_lock, which happens only in the branch that
decrements count. I.e. loop does terminate.

"referenced" as in "had been found by d_lookup, don't shoot me at sight".
When prune_dcache() picks it up it moves the thing on the other end of list
and removes the mark. Caught twice - too bad, it will be freed.
