Is there any known problem with running kernel 2.4.12 on a P54/P55 CPU?  I'm
unable to get a 2.4.12 kernel to boot on a pentium class machine, regardless
of what I choose for the "Processor Family" support in the config.
A similar (if not identical) config of kernel 2.4.5 works just fine, even if
compiled for 686/Celeron processor family.
The machine reboots during the "loading kernel...." phase and before the 
"Uncompressing kernel" boot message.
Any ideas?
