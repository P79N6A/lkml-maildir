I think that most companies do it themselves (or pay to have
it done) for Windows drivers, if their devices don't fit into
some well-known interface.
For Linux drivers, it means finding the right group/project,
if it exists...  Could be hard to find at times.

I hear this way too much, for 2 reasons.
(a) You are right, we want to get to that model in Linux.
(b) The thing that bugs me (I guess) and that people seem to
overlook again and again is that Linux developers are not
provided the same access to hardware interface specs that other
driver developers have.  That leaves reverse engineering or
trial-and-error (mostly error).  That's an awful way to write
a driver IMO.  So to me it's just a specs issue, and many
companies won't or cannot provide product specs (often because
they don't own the IP inside the product, sometimes because
they _assume_ that it might aid their competition).
