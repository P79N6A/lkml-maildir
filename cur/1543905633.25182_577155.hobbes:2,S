Subject: [patch 03/26] rt-mutex: Fix stale return value
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Alexey Kuznetsov found some problems in the pi-futex code. 
The major problem is a stale return value in rt_mutex_slowlock():
When the pi chain walk returns -EDEADLK, but the waiter was woken up 
during the phases where the locks were dropped, the rtmutex could be
acquired, but due to the stale return value -EDEADLK returned to the
caller.
Reset the return value in the woken up path.
