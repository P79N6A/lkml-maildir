Yes, this is a bios feature.  Some motherboards also have a jumper that
you can (un)set to deturmine the state after power restore.  Usually
choices are, always on, always off, or restore previous state (the one I
use when available).
If these options are not provided (and a BIOS update doesn't add them).  I
saw a hardware hack mentioned on slashdot a while back that involved
connecting two pins of the ATX power connector together to provide an
always on setting.  Sorry I don't remember which two pins.
