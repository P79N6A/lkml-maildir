I _really_ prefer
	x != 0
over 
	!!x
since double negation is not only a bad habit in natural languages, it's a 
bad habit in computer languages too, for exactly the same reason. It's 
confusing.
Ask a hundred random C programmers what "!!x" means, versus what "x != 0"
means, and time their replies.
I will bet you $5 USD that even if they all give the right answer (and I
suspect you'll get a few wrogn answers in there too for the !! case),
they'll take a _lot_ longer answering the "!!x" version than they will the 
"x != 0" question.
And guess what? That means that the "!!x" version is worse. It means that
people don't "see" what it means - they have to think about it. And you
shouldn't have to think about something like that, you should write it in 
the obvious way in the first place.
