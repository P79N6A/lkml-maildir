At 
ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/people/miquels/software/cistron-m2n-1.36.tar.gz
you'll find some gatewaying software that is unidirectional, yet
bidirectional ;)
It works by marking the groups as moderated. A posting to the group
will be sent by mail to the moderator, which is a script that
checks and rewrites the news message, and sends it to the list.
That way it's almost impossible for loops to get created.
Mike.
