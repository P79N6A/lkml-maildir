What makes you think its gcc 2.96 ?
If the person concerned can clarify what they built with (2.96-69 or
egcs-1.1.2 (kgcc)), that would be useful.
I've certainly done the Reiserfs testing I did with gcc 2.96-69 with no
problems at all. Reiserfsck was having _bad_ problems but I saw those with
egcs-1.1.2 too and I understand there is a new reiserfsck about to appear
or just out which is much better.
[I've been simulating the effect of bad blocks on file systems]
Worse behaviour so far is minixfs. If an inode rewrite fails leaving what
is now a directory as a file the minix fsck prunes the entire subtree. Very
nasty
