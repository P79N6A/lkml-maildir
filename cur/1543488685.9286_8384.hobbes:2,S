 As I have said before, DIPC is a config time option. You can decide if 
you want it in your compiled kernel. What you say is like claiming it is 
not a good idea to have all those driver sources in the Linux kernel just 
because you won't be using most of them. Please think about this.

 Yeah, but that works backwards: Creating a message passing layer on top of 
a shared memory architecture. Shared memory is more fundamental. IMO an
appropriate "abstraction" should go the other way.

 I'm repeating myself: Not everybody cares!

 I don't think continuing this discussion will convince any of us. Good 
luck with your work.
