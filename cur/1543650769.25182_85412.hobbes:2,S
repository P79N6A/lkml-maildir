I guess my experience with playing with groups is lacking.  I had tried
this, but I guess I always tried with groups I wasn't a member of.  I
still believe this is bad form, but probably has historical and valid
reasons for it.

I see your point here too.  I usually see things from a perspective of
companies not needing this.   I mean "a house divided..." and all that. 
But I guess companies would rather force unity than let the one person
screw them over.  Point to you on the debate for sure.  I know there
have been MAC implementations for Linux... is one in 2.5?

Sounds very good.  I would think for those who know they are united,
that MAC or ACL should not auto-define the other.  Having both, on
option, is nice though.

Hardware is getting more powerful, why segment it through such physical

Understood.  You had many good points.  I still don't see it as a user
space problem though.  These are all things that go in the kernel...
Yes, policy doesn't belong in the kernel, but the ability to create
policy and enforce it does (where user-space may not be the right place,
such as here).
I guess I agree with you, but I still think ACLs are necessary and
wanted, even if there needs to be additional functionality for those who
are totally paranoid (some corps, governments, etc.)

P.S.  I removed Linus from direct in the email because he has said he is
going to add it already.
