i'd suggest to reuse the irq-stacks for this. Right now on 64-bit we've 
got the following stack layout: 8K process stacks, a 16K IRQ stack on each 
CPU, shared by all IRQs. Then we have the IST stacks with weird sizes: 
debug:8K, the others: 4K.
Then all the unnecessary IST complications can be removed. If nesting ever 
becomes an issue, the IRQ stack size can be doubled to 32K.
This way we save some small amount of RAM too (right now the IST stacks 
take up 28K of RAM per CPU), and reduce complexity and fragility quite 
visibly. And help KVM ;-)
