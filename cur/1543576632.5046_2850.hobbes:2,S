Since the 16-color logo was broken a while ago, we need a new one for 2.4.0.
The main limitation is that we no longer can choose the palette, but have to
use the standard VGA 16-color palette.
I quantized the 256-color logo to the VGA palette using ppmquant and used my
rudimentary artistical skills with the GIMP to remove the background pattern.
The results are attached (yes, they are small):
  - new_logo16.png: plain quantized 256-color logo
  - new_logo16_fs.png: quantized 256-color logo using Floyd-Steinberg dithering
  - new_logo16_2.png: new_logo16.png with the background pattern removed
So either some artistic soul creates a new non-offensive politically-correct[*]
logo using the standard VGA 16-color palette, or I'll submit new_logo16_2.png
for inclusion in 2.4.0.
Any comments?
