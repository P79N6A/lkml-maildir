OK. It seems to me the two main hypotheses are: (i) problem with timers,
(ii) problem with keyboard.
In other words: could you (and/or anybody else who can reproduce this
at will) change the #undef DEBUG in i8042.c to #define DEBUG, recreate
the problem, and post or mail the resulting file with keystrokes?
[of course: cut away parts corresponding to login sequences etc.]
This will probably allow us to decide whether the missing key release
was never sent by the keyboard, or was lost by the kernel.
