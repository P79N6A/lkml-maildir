In a lot of cases like the USB stuff they are both the same thing. The
stuff filtering back is bug fixes found in the development tree and tested
by the lunatic fringe. The 2.4 -ac tree doesn't quite obey the rules but
the fun stuff like the O(1) scheduler code is stuff I don't intend to
push to Marcelo.
