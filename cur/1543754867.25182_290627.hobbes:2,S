no, the patch does not break POSIX. POSIX compliance means that there is
an environment that meets POSIX. Any default install of Linux 'breaks'
POSIX in a dozen ways, you have to take a number of steps to get a
strict, pristine POSIX environment. The only thing that changes is that
now you have to add "set RT_CPU ulimit to 0 or 100" to that (long) list
of things.
