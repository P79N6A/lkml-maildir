Well I don't know that much about the ever changing PCI/ACPI support
in kernel - the only thing I could imagine
would be that we sanitize the handling of it at the generic
"chipset quirk handling" there. Right during the "bios table
scan" time... (I mean drivers/pci/quirks.c)
The following function there looks like the right tool for this
purpose:
static void __init quirk_io_region(struct pci_dev *dev, unsigned region, 
unsigned size, int nr)
Well after looking closer I'm convinced that this is
the right place... will you have a look at this plase...
I'm more then busy enbough with other things right now.
