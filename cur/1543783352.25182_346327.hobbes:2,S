I am working with an IBM X31 laptop running Redhat FC5 with 2.6.13
kernel.  I need to get wake-on-lan working for mobile systems power
management experiments that we are performing in my lab.
The kernel is configured to use ACPI (pertinent kernel configuration
excerpt follows message).
When I put the laptop into "mem" suspend state (exact procedure follows
message), and then wake it up with a magic packet to it's NIC, I get an
infinite number of error messages and a frozen computer.
The error message is: "evgpe-0700: *** Error: acpi_ev_gpe_dispatch: No
handler or method for GPE[ B], disabling event" which repeats forever in
an infinite loop.  I have googled extensively for a solution,
unfortunately all published answers that I have found simply say "use
APM instead of ACPI".  When we use APM, we find that power is cut to the
NIC when in mem suspend state, thus preventing the possibility of
wake-on-lan.
Any suggestions greatly appreciated.  Several people in my lab have
tried to get this working, and all have failed.
