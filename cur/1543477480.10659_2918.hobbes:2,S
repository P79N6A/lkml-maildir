I hope to reintroduce the lazy copying fork optimization for big file tables
once the big NROPEN mess is sorted out. For that constructors are needed.
[To be honest I'm still pissed that that nice optimization was thrown out,
without finishing the work - supporting sparse fd arrays fully. It would be
best to either revert fork.c:copy_files to 2.1.5x state or finish the sparse
array implementation]

I don't think it is a good idea to throw out useful infrastructure.
