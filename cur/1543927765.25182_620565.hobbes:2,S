Out of curiosity, how many wakeups/interrupts are involved with the
sound going into polling mode?  Is it going to make a difference as
far as battery life is concerned?
I'm seeing the message:
hda_intel: azx_get_response timeout, switching to polling mode: last cmd=0x005f000c
on my X61s laptop as well, where the last_cmd varies quite a bit.
Over the past two weeks, I've seen last cmd be:
0x003f000c, 0x004f000c, 0x005f000c, 0x006f000c, 0x00db8000,
0x011b8000, 0x011ba000, 0x012ba000, 0x012f000c, 0x013f000c,
0x014f000d, 0x019f000c, 0x020b0001, 0x020b0003, 0x020b2000,
0x020b2001, 0x020b2002, 0x025f0012
Interestingly, when I was using a post 2.6.24-rc1 and -rc2 kernel, I
was getting a lot of these "switching polling to mode messages",
usually within a minute of the machine booting.  Now that I have
switched to a recent rc3 kernel, they seem to have largely gone away.
Looking at my kernel, it looks like the patch you suggested to Roland
was *not* applied, and "git log sound/pci/hda" shows that the only
change to that directory was a patch from Ingo Molnar that I had
cherry picked from LKML.  Given that we were doing a
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible for a full second, that certainly
seems to be a likely candidate for why we were getting the response
timeout message!  Does this analysis make sense to you?

    snd hda suspend latency: shorten codec read
    not sleeping for every codec read/write but doing a short udelay and
    a conditional reschedule has cut suspend+resume latency by about 1
    second on my T60.
