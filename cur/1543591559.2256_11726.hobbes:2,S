I don't know if this'll make sense, but I think this has to
be a ~fuzzy suggestion to the kernel.  There are so many
variables that you can't predict what the kernel will run
into.  For example, with my favorite test, sometimes tasks
do something nasty, like all deciding to do the same things
at once and thereby jerking a _knot_ in the vm's tail.
