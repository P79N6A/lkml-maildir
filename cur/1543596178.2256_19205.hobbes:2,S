Yes, but doing that require 2 annoying things:
 - Parsing of this cookie on each inx/outx access, which can
take a bit of time (typically looking up the host bridge)
 - On machines with PIO mapped in CPU mem space and several
(or large) IO regions, they must all be mapped all the time,
which is a waste of kernel virtual space.
Why not, at least for 2.5, define a kind of pioremap that
would be the equivalent of ioremap for PIO ?
In fact, I'd rather have all this abstracted in a
ioremap_resource(struct resource *, int flags)
iounmap_resource(struct resource *)
("flags" is just an idea that could be used to pass things
like specific caching attributes, or whatever makes sense to
a given arch).
The distinction between inx/oux & readx/writex would still
make sense at least for x86.
Ben.
