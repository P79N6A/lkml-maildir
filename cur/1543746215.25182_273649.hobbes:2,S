What hardware are you using? 349kpps is _low_ performance at 64byte
packets.
Here you can see Roberts (pktgen author) results when testing diffrent
e1000 nics at diffrent bus speeds. He also tested 2port and 4port e1000
cards, the 4port nics have an pci-x bridge...

I get a lot higher than 349kpps with an e1000 desktop adapter running at
32bit/66MHz.
