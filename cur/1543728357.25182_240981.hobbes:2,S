I'd like to switch things over to drivers/Kconfig and/or
drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig. If the drivers are bust I'll just sweep them
when someone complains about the build being bust. One could
proactively find these with make allmodconfig and/or allyesconfig, but
I suspect that may be too large a set of drivers to digest all at once.
Or maybe not -- akpm does scale, after all.
