sh looks like the only one there that would be broken (and that's only
because they don't have a cpu_relax there, but it should be added anyway).
Sure, if we removed volatile from other architectures, it would be wise
to audit arch code because arch maintainers do sometimes make assumptions
about their implementation details... however we can assume most generic
code is safe without volatile.
