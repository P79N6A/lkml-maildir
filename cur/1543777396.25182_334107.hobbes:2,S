Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I would like to get some feedback on this patch for the kernel.  It's sole purpose is to help in reducing boot time by not waiting to synchronize the clock edge with the hardware clock. This when combined with other boot reduction patched can bring the kernel boot time to well under 10 seconds, in most cases two or three seconds.  In a desktop system this patch is probably insignificant, howerver several patches like this in a set top box or cell phone will be signicant.
 I understand that there may be some concerns with patches like these so I would like to start a discussion so that I can better understand what the issues are. The members of the CELinux Forum have quite a bit we would like to contribute.
Looking at the archives I see that a an intel patch was submitted back in October but I am unable to determine what the resolution was.
This patch included is for PPC but other architecutres are available on the patch web site below.
Detailed information on the patch can be found here:

In addition, other patches for boot time reduction can be found here:
