Feel free to implement it. IOW, it's going to be choke-full of races. I
don't envy anybody who will try to do it. Modifications of said file upon
rename()... <shudder> Besides, you'll have to do search in that file.
Definitely not my idea of fun. There are simpler ways to implement a
decent filesystem at *that* cost - after all, since you are going to keep
a lot of metadata in-core you may as well try to write vfat<->ext2
convertor ;-)
