It seems that pci_dma_sync_*() transfers ownership in either direction. In the
example from DMA-mapping.txt, it is used to transfer ownership from the PCI
device to the host CPU. Additionally, the presence of the host write buffer
flush indicates that it can also be used to transfer ownership from the host CPU
to the PCI device.
Am I missing something?
If I'm right, would you accept a patch to clarify the issue in DMA-mapping.txt?
