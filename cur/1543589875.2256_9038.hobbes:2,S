Andrea, 
Do you think I should  install exactly the same version 2.4.4aa3 instead
of 2.4.4.ac3 with the TCP patch ? 
What else can I try to find where my bug is ?
I have DE600 boards too but from the last stress tests I did a few days ago
it was
freezing my system but I suspect this was another story, I then switched to
3com950b
because this is a very well known board and I was suspecting it could help a
lot
to standardize my system. 
I also used DE504 with the de4x5 driver and it was again crashing my system.
I did not used the tulip driver though ( :( ) 
Again, thanks a lot for any help
