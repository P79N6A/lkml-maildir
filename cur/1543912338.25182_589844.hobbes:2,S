In case they'll be of help for such porting, the relevant hdaps
patches from my tp_smapi patch series are attached.

You can do the latter via another (4th) input device.

Is any of the accelerometer drivers currently capable of computing the
physical acceleration? Also, is there an issue of linear vs. angular
acceleration?

Before or after axis inversion/swapping? The tp_smapi hdaps driver
(losslessly) inverts the raw data too, to avoid duplication of
model-specific orientation logic.

The term "free-fall" is dangerously misleading, for the reasons
explained in the IBM APS whitepaper.

hdaps: Add ID fields to the hdaps joystick-emulation input device
Minor ABI break: the input dev name changes from "hdaps" to a more
meaningful "ThinkPad HDAPS joystick emulation", following
Documentation/input/input-programming.txt. The
bus/vendor/product/version have been coordinated with the maintainer
of thinkpad_acpi (the other user of this bus/vendor namespace).

hdaps: Add a 2nd input device for raw accelerometer data
The current interface used for reading the HDAPS accelerometer
requires userspace daemons to poll a sysfs attribute. This causes
interrupts on tickless kernels, and introduces a phase difference
between the userspace->kernel polling and kernel->hardware polling.
To solve this, this patch introduces an input dev interface to the
accelerometer data. It differs from the existing hdaps input dev in
that it produces raw measurements, without fuzzing or calibration (but
with axis reversal, this the model-specific knowledge is already
encoded in the driver).
