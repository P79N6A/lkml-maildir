Not that I know how to fix it. But have you tried running chkdsk on a
device deleted files in windows. Just that I know, that windows would
silently ignore fat errors and will only report them in chkdsk.
Deleting files in windows works fine. There is no problems with it and
windows updates everything. I do that all the time.
(I would even theorize that if you delete files on the device and than farther
delete more files on windows, than windows will fix the problem on the fly)
So it is "bug compatible" with the device, and error recovery
compatible with windows.
