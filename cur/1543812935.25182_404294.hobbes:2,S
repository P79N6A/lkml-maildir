 That's debatable.  Once the spinlock is available, jumping back to
try and get it becomes fastpath code, even though the spinloop itself
is not.  Any delay seen here means lost cycles that could be doing work.
 My only real question is how long 'cli' takes if interrupts are already
disabled.

 __raw_spin_lock_flags is inlined, but only one place, in
_spin_lock_irqsave(), which is no longer an inline.  So there's no real
need to out-of-line the spin code anymore.  This adds nine bytes, which
should be acceptable in an out-of-line function. (Only the unlock functions
are inlined, and even then only if !CONFIG_PREEMPT).
