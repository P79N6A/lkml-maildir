I dont believe this is an application problem. Applications allocating
memory can end up doing page outs for other people. Its really important
they dont get stuck doing a huge amount of pageout work for someone else.
Thats one thing I seem to be seeing with the 10pre11 VM.
Sound cards have a lot of buffering, we are talking 64-128Kbytes + on card
buffers. Thats 0.25-0.5 seconds at 48Khz 16bit stereo
