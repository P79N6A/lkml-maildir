Agreed. If I were a sysadmin where I had users I didn't trust, then
I'd be worried. Actually, I'd simply not enable module autoloading.
In fact, I don't run autoloading because I don't like it personally.
And I'm lucky that I have users on my network that I feel I can
trust. Besides, I know where they live, or at least where they store
their data/theses :-)
