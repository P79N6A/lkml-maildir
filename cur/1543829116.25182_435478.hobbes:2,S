I also had stability issues with 2.6.14+RT+MIPS.
The only point I found it to be stable was under 2.6.13
where it successfully passed a standard battery of QA
tests.  To my knowledge no one has updated MIPS RT
since that time so I'd assume it is either in the
same state as then (best case) or worse (likely) due to
languishing.
Note the MIPS patch under discussion also required a
patch from linux-mips to produce a functional kernel
on the malta 4Kc which was the only MIPS target known
to be supported by that combination.

Well, not for MIPS.  There isn't any easy/painless method of
backtracing the stack so the MIPS version of dump_stack()
doesn't even try.  Instead it scans the entirety of the
stack and prints out anything and everything which smells
like a valid kernel text address, hence the screwy output.

Deselection of RWSEM_GENERIC_SPINLOCK in arch/mips/Kconfig is
a bug.   Unfortunately I don't have an available mips target
ATM and few if any spare cycles, but I'd sure like to get MIPS
through this nagging impasse.
That said, keep in mind due to limitations in the MIPS ABI
which carry over to gcc, latency instrumentation as it
currently exists (or may ever exist) is effectively
unsupportable.  IMHO this is a serious stumbling block for
realistic support of the RT work on this architecture.
