In thinking about truncate more (and at least 'cp' overwrite if not
more), IMHO this is an unavoidable delete and should not be implemented
in undelete.  It would create too much overhead both in disk I/O and
coding (be it in the kernel or user space).  Moving files to a directory
to be deleted later which should have just been truncated in the first
case is too kludgey and backward.
However, for unlink there wouldn't be a big I/O problem in getting the
items into .undelete-- we are just changing links.  It should be
relatively easy to implement, not very intrusive, should be useful in
the general case (rm and gui apps) and won't cause the disk to fill up.
