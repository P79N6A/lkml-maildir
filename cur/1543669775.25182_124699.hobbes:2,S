Some benchmarks on the site. Seems to have a negative effect on kernel
compiles atleast, on machines with lots of memory... Looks like my 24 meg
gateway might just be on the border to benefit from it, unless its 133Mhz
overdrive processor (33Mhz isa bus.. wee) makes compression too
expensive to be beneficial...
