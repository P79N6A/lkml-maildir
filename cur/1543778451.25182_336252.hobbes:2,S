Yeah, the CONFIG_ISA thing makes a lot of sense to me ... however, would
be even better if we can work out (easily) what the disk is attatched to.
Pah, ISA is so shit. Generically, might be useful if we had a 
__GFP_DMA_IF_ISA or something defined in the header files, rather than
just shoving ifdef's all over the place.
OTOH, Jim is right ... the OOM killer is being somewhat psycopathic. Seems
we need 2 fixes ;-)
M.
PS. Warning, this is wholly untested, and generally a bit shit.
PPS. jejb ... your mail bounces.
