Hi,
Could you be more specific about what you mean, please?

That's good advice and I'm likely to adhere to it - if you can show that 
having no spaces between the name of the function and its arguments really is 
the accepted practice.  I've seen both styles on my various travels though 
the kernel, and I prefer the one with the space.  Much as I prefer to put 
spaces around '+' (but not around '.', go figure).
In general, I allow myself the indulgence of cleaning up the odd line here 
and there to be more pleasing to my eyes, so long as it's in the vicinity of 
a substantive change and doesn't introduce a new patch hunk.  You could think 
of it as a perk that takes some of the sting out of doing the grunt work.
