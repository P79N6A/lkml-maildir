You do not need to do anything:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=1668b19f75cb949f930814a23b74201ad6f76a53
As far as I have checked before forwarding Pedro Alejandro's patch, the
out-of-tree IP100 driver exhibited no significant difference with the
sundance driver.
