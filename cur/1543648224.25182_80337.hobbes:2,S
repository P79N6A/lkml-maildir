Hello,
I'm designing a solution for high speed data acquisition. The solution will
be based on a Pentium class processor running Linux 2.4.x
The data will be acquired over ISA bus using DMA at the rate of 52Mbit per
second and then sent over TCP/IP on Ethernet 100MB connecttion to host
computer.
I wonder how to design a driver for the data acquistion bord that will
minimize data copying.
I have 2 ideas:
1) the application will open the driver and use a sendfile(devicefd,
socketfd, ....) call
2) To have the driver DMA data into the kernel buffer and then calling
sock_sendpage directly from the driver.
Do i need to implement some special functionality in the driver to realize
1) or a sendfile will work with an fd to any character device as source?
Maybe somebody already implement something similar?
Please CC me the responce
Thanks
Vadim
