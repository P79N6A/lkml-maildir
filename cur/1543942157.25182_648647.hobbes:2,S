I applied these to 2.6.24, making a few fixups to do so.
If you haven't already done this, I can send them to you.
Here is the list of stuff I found.
mcount-add-basic-support-for-gcc-profiler-instrum.patch:
   fix for changes in patch context in lib/Kconfig.debug
mcount-trace-latency-trace-preempt-off.patch:
   fix for missing #include hrtimer.h in kernel/sched.c
tracer-add-event-markers.patch:Changelog:
   Had to adjust patch for change in kernel/hrtimer.c:hrtimer_interrupt()
   I'm not sure if I did this right.
Thanks for the patch set.  I plan to give it a test today.
