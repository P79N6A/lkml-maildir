One thing I did discover with my dynticks was that APIC on UP i386 was nigh on 
broken for the most part. Virtually all BIOSs disable it and even if you 
force enable it you may have to play with enable_timer_pin to get it to work 
(sometimes 1, sometimes 0) and there was no pattern to when it would be 
required since the BIOS manufacturer cared not. This is why for UP I disabled 
APIC when dynticks was enabled, and would test for one online cpu on SMP and 
do the same. This obviously isn't a solution when cpu hotplug is enabled and 
only one cpu is online.
