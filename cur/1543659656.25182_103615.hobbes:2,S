Hello Larry!

An admirable proof of your respect for freedom and democracy: you don't
agree with him, so you ask him to go away.

Speak for yourself.

Every time  I read  a message from  Richard, I  read a message  from a
reasonable  person, who  believe in  higher things  that just  his own
private interests, and  who tries to promote freedom  in a world where
profit and buisness is more and  more the only law. For that, I'm glad
to read him, and I'll never be able to thank him enough.
I never saw Richard using insults, personals attacks, or such attitude
that you, defenders  of non-free software tends to  use. I always seen
rationals, reasons,  facts and his  own personal convictions.  I don't
always agree with  him, but even if I don't agree  with him, I'm happy
to read what he has to say.
Sure, I  agree with most  of his goals,  and I'm fervent  supporter of
Free Software  and of  the Free Software  Foundation. But this  has no
direct link  with what I think  of Richard. Even if  you disagree with
him,  you should at  least admit  that he's  an honest  and reasonable
person, trying  to defend his  views without falling back  to personal
attack or insults, and that his  goal is to defend _us_, all of people
who use computers. So, please stop your personnal attacks against him,
and fight his arguments with other rational arguments if you disagree.
This is the way democracy works.  This is the way free and responsible
people behave together.

At least for  me, it's by hearing to Richard's  talk that I understood
how  important Free Software  his, and  that GNU/Linux  is not  just a
cheap technical toy.
