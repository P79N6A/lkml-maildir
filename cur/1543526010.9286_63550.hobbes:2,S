I always thought the DSL devices were ethernet bridges (in effect) - and
didn't really speak much IP. Mine here certainly acts like it, I see
ethernet broadcasts from all over (even IPX stuff). The real router sits
at the other end. My cable modem used to do that too, but they upgraded
the firmware and now filter all that junk out..
