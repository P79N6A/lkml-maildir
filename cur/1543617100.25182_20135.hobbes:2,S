Ok. So what do we do about it? I mean there are possibly some more people out
there with such a problem, or - to my prediction - there will be more in the
future. I see to possibilities:
1) simply increase it overall. I have not the slightest idea what the drawbacks
are. 2) make it configurable (looks like general setup to me).
I could provide a patch for either. Do we want that?
Regards,
Stephan
