Only the kernel adds '-nostdinc -withprefix include'.

Which makes it a local gcc build problem.  I run 3.3.3 and it handles
-nostdinc -iwithprefix include correctly.  Compile init/do_mounts.c
with gcc -v to get the list of include paths for your version of gcc,
stdarg.h will not be on those paths.  Rebuild your version of gcc with
the correct paths.
