There's a been a lot of back and forth on this from a number of different
people:
1/18/06   depends on SYSFS
4/25/06 - depends on SYSFS
2/05/07 + select SYSFS
2/05/07 - select SYSFS
        + depends on SYSFS
5/01/07 - depends on SYSFS
It looks like the last removal was in error and it should be added back.
