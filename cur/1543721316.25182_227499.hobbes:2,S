Correct, however the document is for 2.4 as well so in the interests of
not making things more complex than they have to be, it's easier to
tell people to use the old way.

If you don't supply INITRD= then the makefile will prompt you for
it.  Ok, the message can be improved, but it does still tell you
what you did wrong.  I also pointed out that this target is legacy
and probably going away soon, so it can't be used to justify a
point.

You seem to have missed my point again, concentrating on uImage only.
Also, I think you got PPC and ARM confused - PPC is simple, but ARM
depends on the kernel configuration.
