I would like to be able to devide 64bit numbers in a kernel module,
but I get unresolved symbols when trying to insmod.
Does anyone have any ideas how to get around this little issue
(without the obvious of casting the hell out of all my __u64s
when doing division and throwing away precision.)?
Thanks,
Ben
