Ah yes.  Glad to see the problem has been fixed.

Right, I didn't notice that.
It's unfortunate that initialization of various parts of a kobject or
driver-model object is so order-sensitive.  Worse yet is the fact that
these dependencies are not mentioned in Documentation/kobject.txt,
Documentation/driver-model, include/linux/kobject.h, or
include/linux/device.h.  Wouldn't it be a good idea to add, for example to
Documentation/kobject.txt, a description of which members of struct
kobject must be initialized before calling kobject_init() and which must
be initialized before calling kobject_add()?  And of course to do the same
for all the other important structures as well.
