Agreed. The example program you posted does a very good job. I intuitively
thought that it would show best results where CPU clock >>> system clock,
but even with a faster clock (gettimeofday()) and a few tricks, it provides
an excellent whitened output even at high speed. In fact, it has the advantage
of automatically adjusting its speed to the source clock resolution, which
ensures we don't return long runs of zeroes or ones. Here's my slightly
modified version to extract large amounts of data from gettimeofday(),
followed by test results :
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
int get_clock()
{
        struct timeval tv;
        unsigned i;
        gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
        i = tv.tv_usec ^ tv.tv_sec;
        i = (i ^ (i >> 16)) & 0xffff;
        i = (i ^ (i >> 8)) & 0xff;
        i = (i ^ (i >> 4)) & 0xf;
        i = (i ^ (i >> 2)) & 0x3;
        i = (i ^ (i >> 1)) & 0x1;
        return i;
}
int get_raw_timing_bit(void)
{
        int parity = 0;
        int start = get_clock();
        while(start == get_clock()) {
                parity++;
        }
        return parity & 1;
}
int get_whitened_timing_bit(void) {
        int a, b;
        while (1) {
                // ensure we restart without the time offset from the
		// failed tests.
                get_raw_timing_bit();
                a = get_raw_timing_bit();
                b = get_raw_timing_bit();
                if (a > b)
                        return 1;
                if (b > a)
                        return 0;
        }
}
int main(void)
{
        int i;
        while (1) {
                for (i = 0; i < 64; i++) {
                        int j, k;
                        // variable-length eating 2N values per bit, looking
                        // for changing values.
                        do {
                                j = get_whitened_timing_bit();
                                k = get_whitened_timing_bit();
                        } while (j == k);
                        printf("%d", j);
                }
                printf("\n");
        }
}
On my athlon 1.5 GHz with HZ=250, it produces about 40 kb/second. On an
IXP420 at 266 MHz with HZ=100, it produces about 6 kb/s. On a VAX VLC4000
at around 60 MHz under openbsd, it produces about 6 bits/s. In all cases,
the output data looks well distributed :
willy@pcw:~$ for i in entropy.out.*; do echo $i :;z=$(tr -cd '0' <$i|wc -c); o=$(tr -cd '1' <$i|wc -c); echo $z zeroes, $o ones;done
entropy.out.k7 :
159811 zeroes, 166861 ones
entropy.out.nslu2 :
23786 zeroes, 24610 ones
entropy.out.vax :
687 zeroes, 657 ones
And there are very few long runs, the data is not compressible :
willy@pcw:~$ for i in entropy.out.*; do echo -n "$i : ";u=$(tr -d '01' -c <$i|wc -c); c=$(tr -d '01' -c <$i | gzip -c9|wc -c); echo $(echo $u/$c|bc -l) digits/gzip byte;done
entropy.out.k7 : 6.67672246407913830809 digits/gzip byte
entropy.out.nslu2 : 6.27460132244262932711 digits/gzip byte
entropy.out.vax : 4.74911660777385159010 digits/gzip byte
Here are the 4 first output lines of the k7 version :
0100011111001100111011100100100011011101010011110111100011111000
1111101101010110101011101000011010001011010001101101000101011011
1100111100100101000011000011010011101010010101101100011000011000
0100001100101001101000100100101110001001001011000110100111000000
I found no unique line out of 10000. I think the fact that the
clock source used by gettimeofday() is not completely coupled
with the TSC makes this possible. If we had used rdtsc() instead
of gettimeofday(), we might have gotten really strange patterns.
It's possible that peeking around out-of-cache memory data would
add random bus latency to the numbers in such a case, but it's
hard to know what memory size to map to ensure staying out of the
cache.
