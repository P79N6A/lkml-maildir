Still a work-in-progress. It's a monstrous amount of data and it
basically requires a GUI to really get a handle on. Here's a couple
apps I've been tinkering with (aka My First GTK Apps):
http://selenic.com/Screenshot-pagemap.png
That's a snapshot of a live-updating image of memory usage for a
running process (Galeon). Each pixel is a page. Each 32x32 block is
4MB. Mappings are dark red. Pages that are actually faulted in are
bright red. You can poke around in the memory map with the mouse and
highlight mappings (blue). And pages that get faulted in flash green
(hard to capture in a screenshot).
http://selenic.com/Screenshot-kpagemap.png
And that's a live-updating image of system-wide memory usage. Bright
red are pages with a count of 1, dark red are pages with higher
counts. Next is to visualize slab/page cache/buddy/active/lru data as
well as highlight changing pages.
This isn't terribly interesting yet. It can tell you things about page
cache usage and fragmentation and readahead and so on.
But correlating across the two sources, we'll be able to show
information like "what pages in a process are actually
shared/active/lru/etc." You can take it even further by correlating
the above data with symbol info from nm, /proc/pid/clear_refs, etc.
Also, something I immediately noticed on looking at the raw data
(cat /proc/`pidof`/pagemap | hexdump -C | less):

Most of the consecutive page frames are allocated in descending order
(6d 6c 6b 6a ...). That's pessimal for physical merging of block I/O.
Given that we theoretically fixed this long-standing problem in 2.6
but it's obviously still happening, it's clear that a little more
visibility into the VM would be useful.
