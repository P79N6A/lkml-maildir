Subject: [PATCH] USB: force root hub resume after power loss
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch(as785) forces the PM core to resume a root hub after a
power loss during system sleep.  If the root hub had been suspended
before the system sleep then normally the PM core would not resume it
afterward.  Without this resume, various sorts of wakeup events (like
port change events) can get lost.
