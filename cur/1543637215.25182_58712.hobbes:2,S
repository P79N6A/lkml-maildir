It seems to finally work both between two Linux machines and
between Linux and other OSes! Thank you all for your help!
I attach the working source to whoever that cares...

Now, I think I understand what the problem is.
Can we make msync call with MS_INVALIDATE flag temporarily unmap the 
file, invalidate the cache and remap the file again? It sounds like 
a hell of an overhead, but users don't expect msync call to be a 
light one.
Anyway, this would be better than the current behavior, which in fact does 
nothing for the mapped files. Also, the documentation for msync call is 
extremely vague, which only adds to the confusion.
Best,
Giga
