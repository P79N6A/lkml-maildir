So I installed Fedora 8 64b, compiled a 64bit 2.6.24.2,
and XFS mounts without a word of objection :-)
even with my 32bit user-space on that old CD :-)
Interestingly, XFS even survives looped+parallel 
Bonnie++2 - only when I let it run overnight,
in the morning the box was stuck with a 
Machine Check Exception.
This is a dual Xeon Irwindale at 3 GHz, so far it's always
been rock-solid under 32bit operating systems.
Difficult for me to say if the CPU's indeed have a problem
or if this is some sorta compatibility bug...
Anyway it's unlikely to be a XFS-related issue.
I've checked the thermocouple paste on my heatsinks and I'll try 
again tonight with "nomce"...
