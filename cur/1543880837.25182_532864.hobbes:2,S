Subject: [PATCH] Make new setting of panic_on_oom
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/20/146

The current panic_on_oom may not work if there is a process using 
cpusets/mempolicy, because other nodes' memory may still free.
But some people want failover by panic ASAP even if they are used.
This patch makes new setting for its request.
This is not tested yet. But it would work.
Please apply.

+1 and 2 are for failover of clustering. Please select either
