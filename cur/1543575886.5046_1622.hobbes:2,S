Every major g++ release had incompatible libstdc++, even g++ 2.95.2 if
bootstrapped under glibc 2.1.x is binary incompatible with g++ 2.95.2
bootstrapped under glibc 2.2.x (libstdc++ uses different soname then;
even if we used g++ 2.95.2 we would not have C++ binary compatible with
other distributions).
This will change once 3.0 is out, but it will still take some time.

Can you point to things in X which were actually miscompiled because of bugs
in gcc 2.96? So far I was aware about X bugs (already fixed in X CVS) which
were triggered with -fstrict-aliasing which is now the default while
gcc 2.95.2 had -fstrict-aliasing disabled by default.
That is not to say there were not bugs in the gcc we shipped, but the bugs
which were reported against it have been fixed already.
