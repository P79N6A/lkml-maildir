Jon, this works on my machine too.  Greg, if it looks ok can you pull it in?  
And can you add:
 * (C) Copyright 2004 Silicon Graphics, Inc.
 *       Jesse Barnes <jbarnes@sgi.com>
to pci-sysfs.c if you do?
Greg was a little worried that your comment
	/* .size is set individually for each device, sysfs copies it into dentry */
might not be correct.  If not, you can reuse the code from my 
pci-sysfs-rom-7.patch if you want, otherwise it's probably fine aside from a 
bunch of trailing whitespace in the file.  I added the following to my .emacs 
to make it obvious so that I could kill it when I saw it:
(defun linux-c-mode ()
  "C mode with Linux kernel defaults"
  (interactive)
  (c-mode)
  (c-set-style "K&R")
  (setq c-basic-offset 8)
  (setq indent-tabs-mode t)
  (setq show-trailing-whitespace t))
Thanks,
Jesse
