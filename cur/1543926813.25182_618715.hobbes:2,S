Ah ok. I think a generalization of this idea is that when we must mix
indirect blocks and data blocks, at least start the search for a free
block for them from different parts of the block group. Of course, an
added benefit of your suggestion is that the non-metaclustered
indirect blocks will likely be close to the metacluster.
I think this approach will help fsck but from a design point of view it
may not be good for IO performance. E.g., the reason sequential
read performance with metaclustering is same as regular is
because we prefetch co-located indirect blocks (I have verified this by
turning off prefetching). When allocating indirect
blocks outside the metacluster using the above scheme, co-location of
indirect blocks is still likely but less so. OTOH, by falling back to the
old-style allocation routines, we at least make sure that the indirect
block is close to its data block which is good for performance. I think
both approaches are pretty close. One thumb rule we've followed during
metaclustering design is: "when in doubt, favor IO performance over
fsck performance" so I tend to lean towards the latter approach.

Thanks for this nice visualization :-)
I agree with your and Andreas' concern about fragmentation due to the
current scheme of putting metacluster in the middle of the block group.
Here are some stats concerning different metacluster locations:
- Placing metacluster at the end of the block group results in 2%
degradation in sequential reads from large files. Putting it at the
beginning improves sequential read performance by 0.5%.
- For random reads the beginning and ending configurations have
idential performance which is almost the same as regular ext3 performance
but 1% worse than the middle configuration.
- I haven't compared the different metacluster locations for sequential
reads from small files, but in general I've found the behavior to be
very similar to random reads from a large file.
So I think putting metacluster levels at the beginning of the block group
is an obvious choice.
