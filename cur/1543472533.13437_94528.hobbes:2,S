I began thinking about patents a while ago and that was the same conclusion
I came to. Although patents are not ideal, they do at least allow
for people to share their discoveries (encouraged to do so by
license fee earnings) so that the state of the art may be advanced. In
short, the *principle* of patents is sound, IMvHO.
However, this does not excuse those who are allowed to patent ridiculously
simple ideas (using XOR to move screen objects around, f'rinstance) or the
fact that a patent has a fixed life, regardless of the speed at which an
industry moves. Patents in the computing industry should have much shorter
lives and should should not become 75-year (or whatever) cash cows for large
multinationals.
Best Regards,
Alex.
