Subject: [PATCH] Remove 'volatile' from spinlock_types
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi.
This is a resubmission of patches originally created by Ingo Molnar.
The link below is the initial (?) posting of the patch.
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115217423929806&w=2
Remove 'volatile' from spinlock_types as it causes GCC to generate
bad code (see link) and locking should be used on kernel data.
