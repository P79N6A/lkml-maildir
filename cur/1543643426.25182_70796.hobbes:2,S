Michal,
	I don't have an answer for why this happens, but you can compile
ip_conntrack into your kernel as a possible work around.  I did this to
prevent this version issue.

Hi
I'm using plain 2.4.19 on small router with masquerade. Every time I try
to remove ip_conntrack from memory process hangs. It can't be kill -9.
Please let me know what kind of information can be useful to trace this
problem.
I've found in archives that person reporting similar problem some time
ago was asked to show result of ps lax. So here it is:

rmmod ip_co
