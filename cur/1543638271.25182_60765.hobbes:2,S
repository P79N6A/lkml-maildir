none, as in the already existing other implementation. But at least, I'd
prefer an infinite loop instead of some random code being executed without
noticing it.
Do you know a better way of doing that ? The other implementation
used a fake thread which also did a schedule(). I wonder if this
is to make the scheduler work a bit more so that we get more
chances to swap the CPU.
Cheers,
