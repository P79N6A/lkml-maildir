Ok, so something is fishy in 2.6.22 wrt. SMART.
First, booting back to 2.6.20.5 I confirmed that SMART works without any
problems for all 4 disks, so all the following is a regression in
2.6.22.
I have 4 disks: two Maxtors (hdparm -I output below): sda/sdb, and two
Samsung (hdparm -I output is in my previous mail): sdc/sdd.

Selective self-test flags (0x0):
  After scanning selected spans, do NOT read-scan remainder of disk.
If Selective self-test is pending on power-up, resume after 0 minute delay.
<==================== cut ====================>
The output for the other disk is nearly identical, the differences in
the reported values are insignificant.
SMART shows the same behavior regardless if ADMA is enabled or not, but
when booting with ADMA-enabled I got a SATA exception for sdc in about
10 minutes in single-user mode so basically no I/O load. I never got a
SATA exception with ADMA turned off even during heavy I/O load.
