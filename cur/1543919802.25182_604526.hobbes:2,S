It is when the value of a "choice" kconfig object is changed, for example
this .config excerpt:
CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE is not set
CONFIG_REEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y

/What/ works, the patch, or the tree without the patch? (Note I was
testing that on 2.6.23.1, not the git head, so if someone silently
merged things behind me, I might have missed it. Then again, that
would have probably caused an offset, fuzz or reject, which was not
the case.)
