Aehm, if you argument with what we allow in the filesystem, then
I could argue, that everything except '\0' and '/' is allowed
to build paths.
Interesting is what the C-Standard says about naming conventions
for files.
The rest is merely taste and limitations of the build system.
I like ',' as much as ' ' and quotes in file names. But sh*t
happens and we usally have to cope with it :-/
