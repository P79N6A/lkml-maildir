get_hash_table oopses are almost always caused by bad memory.  For
some reason, the buffer cache hashes are peculiarly sensitive to
corruptions.

It's not enough to be conclusive, but the other common footprint of
random memory corruption is register dumps containing a value which is
all-zeroes except for one flipped bit, like your 0x00000002 value in
%ecx.
Let me know if you can reproduce this, but in the absense of any other
pattern, bad memory is the most likely cause for now.
