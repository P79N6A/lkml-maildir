I've kinda lost track of the status of all these patches.  I _think_ Ken
has identified a remaining problem even after his
writeback-fix-periodic-superblock-dirty-inode-flushing.patch, but maybe I
misremember.
Ken, can you remind us of the status there, please?

Bah.

There were heaps of problems in there and it is surprising how few people
were hitting them.  Ordered-mode journalling filesystems will fix it all up
behind the scenes, of course.
I just have a bad feeling about that code - list_heads are the wrong data
structure and it all needs to be ripped and redone using some indexable
data structure.  There has been desultory discussion, but nothing's
happening and nothing will happen in the medium term, so we need to keep
on whapping bandainds on it.
