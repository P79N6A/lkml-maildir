Subject: [patch] fix smp_processor_id() use in the cache-hot autodetector
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

this patch fixes the DEBUG_PREEMPT warnings reported by Paul Jackson.  
The reason why raw_smp_processor_id() is fine here is that we dont care 
about the _precise_ CPU ID the boot process happens on, only about the 
quad. (the reason for this whole code is that NUMAQ doesnt like being 
migrated to a non-boot quad.) So we mark whatever CPU ID we happen to be 
on, and migrate back to it once calibration has finished.
