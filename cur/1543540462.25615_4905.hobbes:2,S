  Event counters are light, and should perform well on a chain which
doesn't have a very high frequency of updates.
  Their worse case is much heavier than inserting/removing cookies into a
chain when the chain is long, but that maybe offset by the cases they do
catch (and long chains should be considered a design bug anyway, and
fixed by increasing the size of the hash-table or the hashing algorithm).
  As you mentioned, the only objection is the extra (constantly wired
down) memory they consume.
  Depending on what events are of interest, the counter may only need to
be updated on an insert (and not on a delete).
