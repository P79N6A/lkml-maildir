This is also what I want to report to Linus, since the 2.4.0 kernel. Some
of the kernel modules (drivers) are not compatible to the kernel API. Such
as a SCSI controller driver PCI2000 PCI2220i and one of the V4L driver
modules, these modules not even get through the compiler, and how come no
one reporting this and fix them up from version to version? Since we are
now up to release 2.4.9, I think these compilation error will directly
effecting the image of Linux. I hope the module maintainer who heard this
message should take some action to fix them up. Or you might able to fix
them up by porting the old code to use the changed APIs, they are probably
using different function names or macros, I don't think there will be a
serious or big change. Just be patient and go through the compilation
error messages from gcc and get through them all. For your case it might
be the include files at your compile time is different from your running
version. Check them.
regards,
David Chow
