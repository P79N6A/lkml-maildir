This is yet another problem for the method above. =(

Allocations will enter this path if free memory is below the minimum
page thresholds, since the allocation will be sort of artificially
failed. Basically, with this in place it's more likely to livelock than
to go on killing sprees. There's a small amount of empirical evidence
suggesting this avoids livelocking in some common scenarios, though
that really isn't good enough for this kind of affair.

I'm not particularly attached to the method, only the result, so I'm game.
