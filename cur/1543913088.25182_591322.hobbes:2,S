It has no direct effect on the correctness of the mathematical model, the 
time is initialized before the time is added to the model.
What you're after is the effect on the behaviour, which wasn't my focus, 
so sorry, I didn't mention it.

Every task gets a little more bonus, but it grows quite slowly, every task 
gets time_slice/task_cnt more than the previous one (assuming all tasks 
are started at the same time), so the 10th gets 2.82*time_slice, the 100th 
gets 5.18*time_slice, the 1000th gets 7.48*time_slice...
I thought about it already and I didn't consider it a serious problem, 
however it's solvable if needed by keeping the bonus separate:
	avg = avg_exec_runtime(cfs_rq);
	se->time_norm = kclock_max(avg - time_slice, se->time_norm);
	se->bonus = avg - se->time_norm;
	cfs_rq->time_sum += avg;
But the bonus also had to be undone when unqueueing the task:
	cfs_rq->time_sum -= se->time_norm + bonus;

You should substract the desired bonus here from the average as above and 
evtl. also store the given bonus separately.
