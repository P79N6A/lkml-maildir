   "Yes, we know that there is no directory hashing in ext2/3.  You'll have to find another solution to the problem, I'm afraid.  Why not ease the burden on the filesystem by breaking up the task for it, and giving it to it in small pieces.  That way it's much less likely to choke."

Sure, you could set up hierarchical mail spools.  But it sure stinks of a temporary solution for a long-term problem.  What about the next application that grows to massive proportions?
Hey, while I've got your attention, how do you go about debugging your kernel?  I'm trying to add fair scheduling to the new O(1) scheduler, something of a token bucket filter counting jiffies used by a process/user/s_context (in scheduler_tick()) and tweaking their priority accordingly (in effective_prio()).  It'd be really nice if I could run it under UML or something like that so I can trace through it with gdb, but I couldn't get the UML patch to apply to your tree.  Any hints?
