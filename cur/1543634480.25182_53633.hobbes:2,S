But finding is limited to get a list of manufacturer/model names and their
current CBTU location. You can't make up a device node from that. Only with
a lot of code you arrive at semi-reliable information.

Actually, with the important exception of IDE disks, most devices are SCSI
in some way, meaning that they understand the SCSI command set. ATAPI
devices are, USB-storage is, IEEE1394 devices are ... so it is not as
restricted as it may seem.
So our consolidated driver structure will IMHO look like this
    0        1              2            3
  disk -->  IDE-disk --> IDE mid(?)--> IDE-low
       \-> SCSI-disk --> SCSI-mid  --> SCSI-low
                     |             \-> FC-low
                     \-> USB-mid   --> USB-low
		     \-> FW-mid    --> FW-low
		     \-> pport-mid --> pport-low
		      ....
  cdrom -> SCSI-cd   --> SCSI-mid  --> SCSI-low
                     \-> IDE-mid   --> IDE-low
		      ....
 
   
The drivers at column 0 would implement the interface to userspace vie the
device nodes. column 1 would generate the commands. column 2 would more or
less be some helper/transport layer whereas 3 would talk to the hardware.
And probably there will be some generalized "linux" command set being used
between 0 and 1, which would further down the chain be converted to the real
low-level commands. (We actually already have such a thing for block devs.)
So at level 1 there would be a more general "linux cmd set to XXX cmd set
converter".
Now, userspace should really not care what sort of device is hiding behind a
"disk" device, except that we 
(1) want to be able to identify and find back a device
   (a) by a path to it                  and/or
   (b) by a unique hardware identifier  and/or
   (c) by its content (a label on it)
(2) may want to be able to send low-level (SCSI mostly) commands for
    configuration  to inquire speical information, or to do things where no
    kernel driver support exists, such as scanning or writing CDs.
    For SCSI-like devices, we always want to use sg for this, IMHO,
    as open() on a sg device is without side-effects and works reliably.
For the above, we only have partial solutions, currently.
(1a) The /driverfs path is exposing how a device is connected
     (Similar to the CBTU tuple, but more general and more reliable.)
     Unfortunately, this is 2.5 only.
(1b) We would need to get some WWN or serial number from the device.
     Unfortunately, not all devices have such a thing; currently
     we need userspace tools (see (2)) to collect such info or
     rely on the low-level driver
(1c) UUID and LVM make use of this, but that's a disk-only thing.
(2)  We currently have no relation between e.g. a disk and a sg device, so
     we lost. We can try to collect this info in userspace programs, but
     it's tedious, error prone and not reliable at this moment.
I hope we will have good solutions for all of these in future.
The reason why we want at least (1a) and one of (1b)/(1c) is that we can
have a device connected to a computer more than once (multipathing).
Some devices offer more than one interface; if a kernel-driver for writing
CDs would exist, we would have both a writer and cdrom driver attached to it.
The fact that it's the same piece of hardware also would need to be reflected
in some way. 
For now, lots of devices hook into the the SCSI subsystem, and what I'm
trying to get is a solution for (2) which also enable userspace solutions
for (1b).

They use SCSI commands, so you will want to offer an interface for
applications to send SCSI commands, unless you want somebody to write a
kernel driver to support CD writing.
This would in my "SCSI-centric world-view" also be a SCSI interface, though
maybe not based on nowadays SCSI mid-layer code.

I imagine that we will continue to allow userspace to send raw commands to
devices, as we won't be able nor willing to support every device type fully
by kernel drivers.
These raw commands will be SCSI commands for most devices.
I imagined, that we register all those devices within some subsystem
which would be a revised, generalized and probably thinner SCSI subsystem.

Which makes we wonder whether we'll present devices by their attachment path
or by their type or both ....
But yes, it would be nice.

See, I would both call SCSI devices. Just because you use a 40/80 pin IDE
cable and a somewhat different low-level protocol, it still understands
SCSI commands.

I would have imagined driver unification as making all devices that
understand SCSI commands to hook into some generalized and cleaned SCSI
subsystem.
Obviously your vision (or only naming?) is different.
How does it look like in your plans?

Please consider applying the attached patch which adds this line.

That would be the /dev/disks/0 ... N, /dev/cd/0 ... M, ... interface, if I
get you correctly. Instead of 0 ... N one might hope to have unique IDs.
But we would still need to find some way to allow extra information, like
the path there, sending low-level commands, ... as we'll never be able
(nor wanting) to push all into the kernel behind the "disk" interface, I
think ...
