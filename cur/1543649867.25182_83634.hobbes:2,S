This is my current understanding of some different ways to schedule:
(1) Yield to a higher priority task (if there is one):
	cond_resched();
(2) Yield to the next task (if there is another one):
	set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
	schedule();
(3) Yield to all tasks:
	yield();
Notes:
(1) Also yields if the current task's time quantum has expired.
(3) Only guaranteed to yield to all tasks on the active list.
Corrections?
Duncan.
