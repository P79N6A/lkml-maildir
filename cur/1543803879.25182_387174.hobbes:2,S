BTW, when you get this message via the list (because I refuse to  
touch challenge-response email systems), shut off your damn email  
challenge-response system before posting to this list again.  Such  
systems are exceptionally poor ettiquite on a public mailing list,  
and more than likely most posters will flag your "challenge" as junk- 
mail (as I did, and will continue doing).
Cheers,
