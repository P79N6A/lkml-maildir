Very strange trace indeed. I'll take a look at this. At least since it
came from Qemu I should be able to "build" a suitable PC to match yours.
Original Intel PIIX devices are handled by "OLDPIIX" (0x8086, 0x1230).
The later ones by ata_piix. The only oddity I see is that you have no
PCI bus mastering address base assigned (bmdma)
