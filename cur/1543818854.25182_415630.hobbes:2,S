A newer Kernel (vanilla 2.6.16.5) doens't solve the problem (hash-shift
is still 25bit and with the default 12bit (0xfff) in NODEMAPSIZE there
is still one bit missing to adress the whole memory).
Anyway, increasing NODEMAPSIZE solves the problem. I wanted to ask you
before doing this because I'm not familar with the code and can't imagin
if this has any sideeffects.
