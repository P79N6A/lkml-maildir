Well I did the change we where talking about .waiting_for_dma -> xxx_bit(IDE_DMA.
And I was asking about it's possible interactions with TCQ.
And now we see that it is indeed apparently really interacting with
the TCQ code in bad ways. But if I look down from the above code (Just below in 
ide.c)
	if (blk_queue_plugged(&drive->queue)) {
			BUG_ON(!drive->using_tcq);
			break;
		}
It seems like the check which is catching reality right now
is bogous in itself. Becouse having DMA running would be
only problematic if the queue was still plugged. (Right?)
So please just disable the check.
This time it's no new damage - just detecting weak code
from the past...
