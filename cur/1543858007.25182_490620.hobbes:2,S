The TCP case is because the protocol limits the size of
the timestamp we can store in the TCP Timestamp option.
Otherwise we would use the full 64-bit jiffies timestamp,
in order to have a larger window of values which would not
overflow.
Since there is no protocol limitation involved in cases
such as dst_entry, I think we should keep it at 64-bits
on 64-bit platforms to make the wrap-around window as
large as possible.
I really don't see any reason to make these changes.  Yes,
you'd save some space, but one of the chief advantages of
64-bit is that we get larger jiffies value windows.  If
that has zero value, as your intended changes imply, then
we shouldn't need the default 64-bit jiffies either, by
implication.
