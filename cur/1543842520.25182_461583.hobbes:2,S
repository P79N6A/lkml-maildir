hi,
there are 2 more patches:
* ext4_remove_relative_block_numbers:
  use 48bit absolute block numbers instead of mixed relative/absolute block
  numbers. This is simpler and seems to fix issues with large file systems.
* ext4_allow_larger_descriptor_size:
  allow larger block group descriptors: this patch will allow to add new
  features that need more space in the block descriptor.
here is the complete patch set:
http://www.bullopensource.org/ext4/20060908/ext4-linux-2.6.18-rc6.tar.gz
there's also a patch set for the latest e2fsprogs that is in sync with the
kernel patches:
http://www.bullopensource.org/ext4/20060908/ext4-e2fsprogs-1.39.tar.gz
cheers,
