That's where KFREE(ptr) comes in so that the code doesn't look ugly and still the purpose is
achieved.
"I still do not know of a single good reason as to why we should not do this."
And if all programmers did the right thing always then why do we have all the debugging options in
the first place.

Really? Then why do we have all the debugging options to catch re-use of the memory that has been
freed. So many debugging options has been implemented, so much effort has gone into them, partly
because programmers sometimes miss correct programming.

I do not know what you are talking about here. You are saying that a function does not need three
different arrays with different names. How can you say that? How do you know what is the
requirement?
