On process teardown pages are freed via the tlb mechanism. That mechanism 
guarantees that TLBs for pages are flushed before they can be reused. We 
tie into that and put pages on quicklists. The quicklists are trimmed
after the TLB flush.
If a shrinker would indepedently free pages from the quicklists then this 
mechanism would no longer work and pages that still have a valid TLB for 
one process may be reused by other processes.
