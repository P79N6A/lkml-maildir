Well are we sure that the `flags' and `count' fields will always fall into
the same 256-byte range?  Wouldn't it subtly break if sizeof(struct page)
became not a multiple of eight?  Will the compiler pad it out anyway?

They can be 8k, rarely.  Usually 4k.  But ext2_set_bit() and friends are
nonatomic - the filesystem does the locking.
We just added the new ext2_set/clear_bit_atomic() functions which _are_
supposed to be atomic.  The architecture is passed a spinlock which it can
use for that, but only big-endian architectures are likely to need it.
