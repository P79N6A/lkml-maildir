sleep_on_timeout() uses a one-shot timer internally.
but for 2.4, the changing of the timer interface is out of question. My
main goal was to achieve good SMP scalability with the existing interface.
i do not agree with passing the timer address instead of the ->data field.
It's one more dereference to use, for no particular reason. If you want to
get at the timer structure you can still do it by embedding it into a
structure:
	struct foo {
		...
		timer_t timer;
		...
	}
and ->data will point to &foo.
with the timerlist lock being per-CPU, basically all lock contention has
been eliminated. So it's not a problem anymore to drop/reaquire the lock,
it's not more than a nicely cached, CPU-local variable.
