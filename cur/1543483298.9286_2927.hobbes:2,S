Ah, excuse me, I misunderstood, I thought you mean you wanted to protect
the region with the spinlock.

The point is that to get delayed for 210 usec you must mark the bh with in
a window of time that is near zero (the faster the CPU the smaller the
window).

Hmm, I trust that start_bh_atomic() is SMP safe (if it isn't we should
have noticed that because start_bh_atomic() is mainly used to close the
window for SMP races ;). But can you show me the window you seen with a
simple scheme?
