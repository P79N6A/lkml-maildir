Modester:
Dual Xeon, 2.20GHz with hyper threading.
512M of ram, but with CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y.
I am running
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/namesys-utils/nfs_fh_stale.c
with 
./nfs -p 41 -i 100000000 -B -L 22000000 -F sync=0 -s 0 -f 1000000000 -M 1000000000
on reiser4. Its on-disk working set stabilizes somewhere around 14G, and
it produces large amounts of ->writepage() traffic.
