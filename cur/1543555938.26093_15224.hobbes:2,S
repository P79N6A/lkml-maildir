I can replicate this message any day you want.  It seems that this card is
perhaps a bit too sensitive to high interrupt latencies or something to
that effect.  Dan Hollis worked on my box for several days and we found
that the problem tends to trigger (in my case) when nfs is in use.  But I
still haven't had time to explore further.  :(
Dan tells me the chip in question is a Centaur so I presume eventually
kernels will identify it correctly once somebody adds it to the list.  :)
