Yes. The mechanism that I proposed allows one to provide the info at each
call of set_pte_mm(). set_pte() would only be used for the arch specific
stuff and would become a legacy thing.

Would not the generic code if done the way I suggested make the updating
of each platforms code unnecessary?
I have the similar issues with the page scalability patch. Should I not do
the legacy thing for platforms that do not have atomic pte operations?
