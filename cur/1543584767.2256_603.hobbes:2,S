agreed. Also, touch_nmi_watchdog() is stateless and is thus much less
prone to locking bugs.
i've attached nmi-watchdog-2.4.2-A1 that implements touch_nmi_watchdog(),
ontop of 2.4.2-ac18, and changes show_state() to use this interface. (the
patch also takes the NMI counters out of the obscure in-function place
they used to be.)
the patch compiles & boots just fine on 2.4.2-ac18 in both SMP and
APIC-less-UP mode. The NMI watchdog is functional, and SysRq-T does not
cause a lockup if used with a slow serial console that takes more than 5
seconds to output the tasklist.
