This has to be considered a bug.  The spec certainly implies that a limit
of zero should be honoured and, probably more importantly, that's how it
works in 2.4.
Problem is, the code in there all assumes that an it_prof_expires of zero
means "it was never set", and changing that (add a yes-it-has flag?) would
be less than trivial.
So I think the path of least resistance here is to just convert the
caller's zero seconds into one second.  That in fact gives the same
behaviour as 2.4: you get whacked after one second or more CPU time.
(This is not a final patch - that revolting expression in sys_setrlimit()
needs help first).
