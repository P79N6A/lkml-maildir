Hello all,
I'm experiencing problems in having the vt8237 S-ATA controller working 
properly on my board (MSI KT6-Delta).
I'm running 2.6.0-test11-bk10 (distro: Debian 'testing').
After browsing the list archive, I found something about this problem 
(threads: "SATA and 2.6.0-test9"and "Linux 2.6.0-test9"), but no solution...
I then surfed the net and it seems that there is a patch for 2.4.22 
kernels (I don't know wether it works or not).
So my questions are:
1) is this issue to be resolved shortly in 2.6.0-testX ?
2) Which SATA PCI controller is known to work properly under 2.6.0-test11 ?
The machine is currently under testing, so I can try experimental 
patches if it can help the process.
Thanks in advance for any reply.
