I agree, pcihpfs should go away, and you should use sysfs instead.  It's
on my list of things to do, but pretty low on it right now :(
Any patches to do this would be greatly appreciated.
One nice side affect of a conversion to sysfs, would be that different
pci hotplug drivers would be able to create their own files for
different attributes very easily (I know the author of the IBM PCI
Hotplug driver would really like to do this.)
Good luck,
