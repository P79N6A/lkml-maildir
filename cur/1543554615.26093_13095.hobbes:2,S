I haven't seen anybody point at this URL
	
http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/hist.html
where you can read about early Unix story from the horse's mouth 
himself.  The paper is 20 years old, but still full of very tasty 
tidbits.  Browse around and you'll find many more interesting goodies.
In particular, if you want to know the story of how C came to be, as 
told by its creator, try this URL

Take it from somebody who has been hacking all sorts of Unix and 
Unix-like kernels for the last 25 years: Those who don't know Unix 
history are doomed to reimplement it badly.
