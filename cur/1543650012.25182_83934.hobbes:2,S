I'll just continue to point people to mochel@osdl.org when they ask

Like I touched on in IRC, there is room for both sysfs and per-driver 
filesystems.
I think just about everyone agrees that ioctls are a bad idea and a huge 
maintenance annoyance.  So, what is the alternate solution?  IMO your 
choices are presenting a device node for control via read(2), write(2), 
and poll(2), or exporting a bunch of ASCII-controlled interfaces.  While 
I certainly agree with the overall strategy of sysfs, I can't see it as 
being the best interface for wholesale replacement of groups of ioctls. 
 So that leaves per-driver filesystems, which have a bunch of benefits...
* allows for implementation of true character devices (chardevs), 
something which sysfs was never intended to do
* solves module unloading problem, because filesystems must be mounted 
before accessing and umounted before removal, which implies that there 
will be no races at the open(2) level
* we all admit that sysfs doesn't attempt to solve similar problems as 
devfs.  so if one wants to do a sane device filesystem, a custom fs is 
needed
* mount options are the current best solution for providing decent 
default file permissions for dynamically instantiated file nodes.  It 
keeps policy in userspace while still providing dynamic file nodes in 
the kernel.  per-driver filesystems give you the granularity needed to 
accomplish this.
* as fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c and libfs.c shows, you don't have to worry about 
code bloat, so the only real overhead is the structures that are 
involved in superblock/vfsmount operations
There were a couple other benefits I have forgotten by now :)
