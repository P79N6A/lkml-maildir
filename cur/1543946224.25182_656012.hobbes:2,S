Subject: [mm][PATCH 0/4] Add soft limits to the memory controller v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset implements the basic changes required to implement soft limits
in the memory controller. A soft limit is a variation of the currently
supported hard limit feature. A memory cgroup can exceed it's soft limit
provided there is no contention for memory.
These patches were tested on a PowerPC box, by running a programs in parallel,
and checking their behaviour for various soft limit values.
These patches were developed on top of 2.6.25-rc2-mm1. Comments, suggestions,
criticism are all welcome!
TODOs:
1. Currently there is no ordering of memory cgroups over their limit.
   We use a simple linked list to maintain a list of groups over their
   limit. In the future, we might want to create a heap of objects ordered
   by the amount by which they exceed soft limit.
2. Distribute the excessive (non-contended) resources between groups
   in the ratio of their soft limits
3. Merge with KAMEZAWA's and YAMAMOTO's water mark and background reclaim
   patches in the long-term
series
