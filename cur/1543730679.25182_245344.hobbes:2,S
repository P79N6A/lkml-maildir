Nope.
SIGKILL _already_ doesn't actually wake up a ptraced task. It just informs 
the tracer, last I looked.
So a new state should be pretty simple, and I really think it would be the
right way to go. That said, I might just be completely wrong - maybe there
are practical problems to that approach that I don't see right now.
