well what about the info from /proc/
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/info
processor id:            0
acpi id:                 0
bus mastering control:   no
power management:        yes
throttling control:      yes
limit interface:         yes
and:
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling
state count:             2
active state:            T0
states:
   *T0:                  00%
    T1:                  50%
and:
[root@joker ~]# cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
active state:            C2
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     d18324c9
states:
    C1:                  type[C1] promotion[C2] demotion[--] 
latency[000] usage[01340140]
   *C2:                  type[C2] promotion[--] demotion[C1] 
latency[090] usage[02980043]
