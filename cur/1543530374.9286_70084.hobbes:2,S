   Yes, of course, but first of all I'd like to know what exactly the
problems are.  I dislike creating yet another architecture specific function
-- I'd prefer to keep the function generic, but allow the architecture
to set the right constants (either by macros in pci.h [which can be defined
to call functions if needed, of course] or by adding a new entry in struct
pci_dev).
				Have a nice fortnight
