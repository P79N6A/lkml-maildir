   IGNPAR    INPCK         ACTION:
     0         0           Deliver all data to the user-level, as is.
     0         1           Deliver nulls in place of erroneous bytes
     1         0           Discard erroneous bytes, deliver the rest
     1         1           Discard erroneous bytes, deliver the rest 
IGNPAR gets processed before INPCK: 
(from drivers/char/n_tty.c:488)
static inline void n_tty_receive_parity_error(struct tty_struct *tty,
                                              unsigned char c)
{
        if (I_IGNPAR(tty)) {
                return;          /* discard data */
        }
        if (I_PARMRK(tty)) {
                put_tty_queue('\377', tty);
                put_tty_queue('\0', tty);
                put_tty_queue(c, tty);
        } else  if (I_INPCK(tty))
                put_tty_queue('\0', tty);     /* deliver null */
        else
                put_tty_queue(c, tty);        /* deliver data */
        wake_up_interruptible(&tty->read_wait);

Yes. I call that part a "line discipline". n_tty is the TTY line 
discipline that implements termio(s) and some legacy functionality.
And yes, for received data with parity errors, the line discipline 
handles IGNPAR, as well INPCK and PARMRK. See snippet of n_tty.c above.
