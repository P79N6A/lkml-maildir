I should also point out the above *udma2 is interesting because:
hdparm /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Invalid argument
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
This *thinks* that dma is off yet querying hdc says it's in udma2 mode and the 
actual performance very much suggests to me that dma is enabled as it doesn't 
have those awful lags that dma off dvd access usually has.
Even though it apparently works fine I do get these instead though:
hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xec
hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xec
blah...
