Lots of code looks totally reasonable to a kernel coder, except it doesn't
actually work when run, or doesn't actually build for a common architecture.
Let's face it - if I hit a bug on my Dell Latitude in a -mm kernel, our
current depth of testers means that I'm probably the only person who's
likely to test the fix before it goes uptream to Linus as a "probably works".
