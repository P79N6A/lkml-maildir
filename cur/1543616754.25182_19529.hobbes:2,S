looks dirty, the size of the kernel direct mapping is mainly in function
of #defines that can be changed freely, they're not constant in function
of CONFIG_1G etc.. and it changes also in function of smp/up/4G/64G
options.  The 3GB/2GB/1GB/3.5GB visible into the menuconfig are exact
instead.  So I wouldn't mention inprecise stuff that can changed under
us (and the exact size of the kernel direct mapping doesn't matter to
the user anyways I think [and if it matters I think it means he's
skilled enough to know about vmalloc space ;) ]).
