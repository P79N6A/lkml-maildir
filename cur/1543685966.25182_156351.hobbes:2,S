Uh, forgive my ignorance. "journal" means metadata+data journaling. If I have
large data movement, how can that be even faster? Ok, I see the facts around
sync'ing the fs. But anyway the data size written should be nearly doubled
compared to data=ordered. Reiserfs journaling has to be real incredible in
comparison to ext3(ordered). I have the impression that large files are hit
most.
