I'm running 2.6.14-rc4-rt6 and trying the skge driver instead of the
sk98lin and I'm getting these warnings in my logs (this is probably not
related to the rt patch):
  network driver disabled interrupts: skge_xmit_frame+0x0/0x320 [skge]
No other relevant messages around that I can see. Is this a bug? Any
information I could supply to help debug it?
