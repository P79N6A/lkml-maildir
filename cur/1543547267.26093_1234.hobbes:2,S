I doubt this is obviously correct. The last time this issue
came up, it was discovered that Windows 9x does not use the
same generation rules as Windows NT.
Consider that Microsoft has been trying to kill Windows 9x
for the last half dozen years, one might prefer the NT method.
With config.sys and autoexec.bat being ignored by the Windows
Millennium Edition, the transition seems to be making progress.
