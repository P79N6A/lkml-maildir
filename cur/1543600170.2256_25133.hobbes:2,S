Some persons are reporting problems with Q3 (which mmap's /dev/dsp)
and the latest emu10k1 driver. Others (like me) don't see any problems.
Under investigation.
What Q3 version are you using?
Can you send me a strace of the Q3 startup?

The driver definetely follows the OSS specification. If a problem was
found at Loki then it would be nice to have a detailed bug report...
