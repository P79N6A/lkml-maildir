I've not looking closely into the code, but why do you use "PNP0A05"
for container device?
"PNP0A05" is defined as "Generic ISA devie" in the ACPI spec.
I think "module device (ACPI0004)"  sounds more suitable for the
purpose, though I don't know whether your hardware will support it
or not.
Also, assuming devices that have _PXM are nodes sounds a bit too
aggressive for me.  For example, something like below is possible.
Device(\_SB) {
  Processor(CPU0...) {
     Name(_PXM, 0)
  }
  Processor(CPU1...) {
     Name(_PXM, 1)
  }
  Device(PCI0) {
     Name(_PXM, 0)
  }
  Device(PCI1) {
     Name(_PXM,1)
  }
}
(I don't know if such an implementation exists, but from the spec,
it is possible)
In this case, OS has to group devices by same number.
Please don't assume specific ACPI AML implementatin as a generic
rule.
