If you haven't already, I'd drop linux-bugs@nvidia.com an email to see if they 
have any insight. Not that this can't be a kernel bug, just that it's a bit 
difficult for kernel developers to debug when you're using a driver for which 
we don't have the sources.
As for changing the IRQ assignments, I don't have any immediate suggestions. I 
notice that this laptop has a dual core processor, so I'm guessing disabling 
APIC isn't an option. Have you tried that anyway, just to see if the IRQ 
assignment differs?
