Also Glibc 2.0.110, system hung while booting trying to load lpd. lp
stuff as module. Also failed to load vfat and ps mouse.
I tried going to glibc 2.0.111, but linuxthreads-2.0.111 would not
compile.
pre8 boots fine.
Backing out the change to entry.S works here.
Does vfork count as a brown paper bag?
