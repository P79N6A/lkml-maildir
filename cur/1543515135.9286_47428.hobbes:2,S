	The documentation for hdparm -i says:
       -i     Display the identification info that  was  obtained
              from the drive at boot time, if available.  This is
              a feature of modern IDE drives, and may not be sup-
              ported  by older devices.  The data returned may or
              may not be current,  depending  on  activity  since
              booting  the system.  However, the current multiple
              sector mode count is  always  shown.   For  a  more
              detailed interpretation of the identification info,
              refer to AT Attachment Interface  for  Disk  Drives
              (ANSI  ASC X3T9.2 working draft, revision 4a, April
              19/93).
