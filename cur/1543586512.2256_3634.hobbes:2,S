I think that should be split in two, one thing is building and install a kernel
and one other is add the entry in your bootloader config ('update-bootloader',
for example, that looks into /boot and adds missing entries).

I usually think about /proc like the way to do a 'cat' instead of a 'syscall',
in this case to ask kernel for various md5 sigs,
but of course you can always write a user app that queries kernel and prints
result for your scripting pleasure...
