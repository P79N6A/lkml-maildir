It matters more than just barely - if you care about non-overcommit,
or if you care about non-wrapping Committed_AS in your /proc/meminfo.
Ignoring VM_ACCOUNT when merging is very much the wrong thing to do,
because it lets an unaccounted area be treated thereafter as accounted,
or vice versa - even forgetting the MAP_NORESERVE special case.
I have by now recalled why I chose to play those VM_ACCOUNT games:
	/* We set VM_ACCOUNT in a shared mapping's vm_flags, to inform
	 * shmem_zero_setup (perhaps called through /dev/zero's ->mmap)
	 * that memory reservation must be checked; but that reservation
	 * belongs to shared memory object, not to vma: so now clear it.
We need a way to communicate not-MAP_NORESERVE to shmem.c, and we don't
just need it in the explicit shmem_zero_setup() case, we also need it
for the (probably rare nowadays) case when mmap() is working on file
/dev/zero (drivers/char/mem.c mmap_zero()), rather than using MAP_ANON.
Still haven't decided what's best to do about it (plenty of diversions):
perhaps we just say my error was to overload VM_ACCOUNT, and define a
new flag for the purpose, which can go into VM_MERGEABLE_FLAGS; but
I'd prefer a neater solution if it crosses my mind.
