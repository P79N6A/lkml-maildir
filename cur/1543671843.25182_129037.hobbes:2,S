 nooo..  That has a big cache footprint.  At the very least you should use
 a binary search.  gcc will do it for you:
 	switch (n) {
 	case 0 ... 1:
 		return 1;
 	case 2 ... 3:
 		return 2;
 	case 4 ... 7:
 		return 3;
 	case 8 ... 15:
 		return 4;
 etc.

I agree him, The Lastest code my posted has works fine, Please check it.
