How about one more cleanup: make the x86 do_int3()/do_debug() calling
convention be independent of CONFIG_KPROBE? 
Btw, the way to test against zero in x86 asm is not
	cmpl $0,%eax
but rather the shorter
	testl %eax,%eax
which just shows that the person who wrote the asm probably was used to
saner CPUs ;)
