The cards I updated where:
	EPIC100, NE2K, TULIP, RTL8139, VIA-RHINE
The epic100 update caused a short sharp hail of "its dying" reports so I've
reverted back to the old one + the small packet lockup fix.
The 3c59x saga is an ongoing item. Right now the last 3c59x driver that
correctly handles the 3c590 card is 0.49H. The others cause a hang eventually
with the status indications being "nothing to do, nothing happening, in 
the right window"
