I've seen in recently purchased computers that the very initial
messages, like memory test, are masked by some kind of picture or logo
(example are the HP kayaks). They display a message saying that pressing
ESC or some function key displays the messages. Why not having the same
in this pretty boot option. I wouldn't mind not seeing all those
messages.
