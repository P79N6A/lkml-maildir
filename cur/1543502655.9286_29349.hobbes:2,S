Sounds fair to me. I added it, because in the early days of Linux, we
were much more dependent on easy access to text data from DOS. This
has changed, and nowadays, most documents under Win/DOS are binary
anyway.
It would be nice though if you could follow the usual phase-out
procedure: flag it as obsolete and printk a warning, then remove it
and printk an explanation, and finally remove the explanation.
