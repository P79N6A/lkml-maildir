Subject: [patch] swap cache read accesses

I was running `./bw_mem 120m rd' (from lmbench) and I noticed my swap to
be eaten completly in some second. All the cache was full of swap cache
pages.
The problem is that there is no good reason to map in the process a
read-only swap cache page if the swap cache page was not shared.
Mapping the swap cache page even if it wasn't shared not only cause the
kerenl to go low of swap entry, but it will also cause an additional page
fault and cow if after the read access there will be a write access.
With this my patch everything is normal while running `./bw_mem 120m rd'.
I have not yet benchmarked the thing but I think it will be an improvement
while using swap cache pages (for the reasons above).
Patch against 2.2.7:

The check for PageSwapCache() was useless.
