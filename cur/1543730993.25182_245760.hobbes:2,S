Well, you _could_ make it do a "tar", but what's the point? That really 
doesn't add any value as far as user space is concerned.
Think of it this way: if the directory and the "default stream" associated 
with it aren't independent, then user space already has the information, 
and the stream is pointless. In fact, the stream is _worse_ than 
pointless, because it hides the fact that there is no independent 
information.
See my point?
