   In current kernels, sys_read(), sys_write() and similar system call
handlers do lock_kernel(), therefore the calls to your driver (except
for interrupts) are guaranteed to be serialized (unless you sleep there,
of course).
   The only thing you need to do is to do proper synchronization between your
IRQ/BH handlers and the other functions which can be done either by
clever queue manipulation or by spinlocks.
				Have a nice fortnight
