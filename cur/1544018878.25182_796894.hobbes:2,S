Hello,
that did the trick. Openssl now gets a whole core exclusively and gives full
performance.
Regarding quantum chemistry application -- it is also using pipes
for communication between worker processes. Now this app works OK.
Where I can read more on tuning sched_features for different workloads?
Also, is there a way get a list of available schedulers and how to switch
between them?
thanks, Pawel
