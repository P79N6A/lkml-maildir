"This update is alredy available on the Internet for free download at the
usual ftp sites. Distribution vendors are alredy working hard to make it
available for Business and Desktop users over the usual distribution
media. New integrated and fully supported distributions are expected to be 
ready to ship on CD-ROM later this spring."
