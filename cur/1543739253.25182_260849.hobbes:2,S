I don't _think_ they are guaranteed to be executed immediately after the 
  interrupt handler top half is complete, but they will execute before 
the next return to user space (read: they will complete before user 
processes run again).

A tasklet can get preempted by a hard interrupt, but tasklets run in 
interrupt context, so don't do anything in a tasklet that can call schedule.

IIRC, a tasklet will execute once for every time tasklet_schedule is called.
