Trying to apply the 05 patch, I discovered that it was already
in there.  Something is messed up with the combined patches, so
I went back to the tgz file you provided and started over.  I'm
not sure what the kernel is that I built and tested earlier today,
but I suspect it was, for the most part, the complete patchset
(i.e., patches 1-5).  Building a kernel with patches 1-4 from
the tgz file does not need the additional defines mentioned in
my previous email.
Testing is starting from scratch with a known patch base.  The
plan is to test with patches 1-4, then add in 05.  I should have
some numbers for you before the end of my day.  btw, the numbers
looked real good for the runs on whatever kernel it was that I
built this morning.
