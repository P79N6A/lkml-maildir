The ports in question are PCI values. They come from the PCI
specifications and apply to any device with PCI bus, unless it has
special mappings. The same logic you are whining about is already partly
handled in the generic pci quirks code, and in time will end up with the
I/O port value fixups there anyway.
See quirk_ide_bases in drivers/pci/quirks.c
Go read the specifications and stop whining about legacy ports and ISA
bus for things that are not.
Ack Al Viro's changes but with IRQ set to zero.
