You have this the wrong way round. The CLONE_PID option is one
approach to implementing signals according to the POSIX threads
spec. But it is not the only approach, and since it would require a
separate notion of thread id to be added to the kernel, it might not
be the simplest approach (as far as the kernel is concerned).

I agree that signal delivery should happen completely within the
kernel for the reasons you give.
But consider implementing the POSIX signal semantics on top of
CLONE_PID. The obvious way is:
    for_all_tasks_with_pid(p, pid)
        if (!sigismember(&p->blocked, sig)) {
	    deliver signal;
            return;
        }
    put signal on some per-process pending set;
This is simple, but takes O(Nthreads), because we have to go through
all threads with the particular pid. But there is another approach,
which is hardly any more complicated, and takes O(log Nthreads) for
signal delivery; this approach doesn't care about the pids at all, and
so can be implemented as easily with or without CLONE_PID. I'm not
going to describe the details here, but my point is that "literal"
implementations of POSIX are not automatically best in any sense; you
have to consider the alternatives carefully first.

There is a important distinction between "received by all threads" and
"affect all threads".  There is nothing in POSIX.1 (that I can find,
at least) to state that any signal should be sent to all threads
within a process. Section 3.3.12 says
  Signals generated for the process shall be delivered to or accepted
  by exactly one of those threads within the process.
and that appears to apply to all signals equally. Section 3.3.12 goes
on to say
  When a signal is delivered to a thread, if the action of that
  signal specifies termination, stop, or continue, the entire process
  shall be terminated, stopped, or continued, respectively.
So there is no need to propogate the signal, we just have to make sure
that all the threads get terminated (though there are subtleties
involved even in that).
On the other hand I suspect that handling stop and continue signals
robustly will need help from the kernel.
