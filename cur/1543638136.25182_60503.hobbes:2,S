I disagree.  If for some reason the multimedia player can not keep up,
there will be corresponding changes to subsequent requested timeouts.
For example, the pattern of future timeouts will reflect the new lower
frame rate (e.g. timeout after 1/15 s instead of 1/30 s).  (BTW: I've
written adaptive media players, so I'm speaking from experience).
How repulsive would it be to add a boolean parameter that indicates
whether the supplied timeout value is relative or absolute?
