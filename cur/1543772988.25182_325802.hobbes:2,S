Yes, that's a deadlock.

And that will fix it.  (Labels start in column zero, and a comment is
needed here).
However I wonder if it would be sufficient to remove the del_timer_sync()
call altogether and just do mod_timer() in it_real_arm().
If the handler happens to be running on another CPU and if the handler
tries to run mod_timer() _after_ the do_setitimer() has run mod_timer(),
the handler will use the desired value of it_real_incr anyway.
