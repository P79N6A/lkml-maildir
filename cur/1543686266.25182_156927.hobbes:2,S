Oh, I definitely prefer a separate MSI handling path too.
In the future we'll be writing drivers that _require_ MSI interrupt 
handling, and we'll be optimizing the various MSI hot paths to reclaim 
even the most minute amount of CPU cycles.  And we want to escape any 
shackles the evil phrase "legacy interrupts" dares to try to lay upon us.
But there is a flip side to that:  do_IRQ is not solely hardware 
interrupts.  That area of code is central dispatcher for 
softirq/tasklet/timer delivery as well.  So a separate do_MSI() needs to 
take that stuff into account.
Overall, I'm pretty happy with how Tom's MSI patches are going so far, 
and he seems to be responding to feedback.  So, we'll get there.
