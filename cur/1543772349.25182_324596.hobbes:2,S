This is no longer an issue. We did an interrupt disable conversion so
now there is only a few places that actually disable interrupts. It
hasn't been tested fully, but you should be able to used whatever
drivers you want and still get the same interrupt latency. However,
preempt latency is still and issue for these drivers.
