All that is cool.  Still, most places we don't really address the
processor, so the logical cpu number is all we need.  Places like
sched_yield, for example, should be using this, not the actual number,
which IMO should only be used when, for some reason, we NEED the hard
address of the cpu.  I don't think this ever has to leak out to the
common kernel code, or am i missing something here.
