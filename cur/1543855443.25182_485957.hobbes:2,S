What the drive reports as "native" capacity indeed does
*not* take into (negative-)account those sectors, that have
been remapped.   So after real remaining capacity has dropped
below original capacity,  querying the "native" size still
returns the original size, which is no longer physically
backed.
This is, I admit, practically irrelevant, because such 
drives should really be dumped before doing any harm 
to one's precious data, but please read further...

This pattern is probably of vanishing importance with modern
BIOS's (caring less and less about too large disks) and old
old OS's (being less and less runnable on modern hardware despite
these kinds of hacks).

I see it as a rational wish to not interfere with *these*
reserved sectors (e.g. when installing linux parallel to
windows), even for correctly working drives.
I ask for a module/boot-option to allow to skip hpa-checks
generally, or even for specific drives - to be used, if one
needs to be sure that these reserved sectors of a connected
drive are not going to be touched, even when re-partitioning
the disk.   Afterall that's why they are reserved in the
first place.
That said, it's surely good to be able to access them, if one
desires so.
