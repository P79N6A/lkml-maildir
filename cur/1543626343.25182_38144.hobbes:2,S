 It is the failing condition.  It need not be a result of a hardware
failure.

 A fan blockage is a hardware failure as well.  Regardless of the reason. 
It certainly isn't a software failure.

 Sure that is a way to protect the CPU but it may fail if the reason is
not heat emitted by the CPU.

 But it matters if an operator got warned before (that is what I remarked
originally).  The operator may be in a distant location.  Or he may be
nearby and be able to act to stop the fire once he gets a message.

 Sure it is a way to try to recover, if hardware provides it, but it's
completely orthogonal to the question whether to report a thermal problem
or not and at which priority.
