It means only one thing. That bulk of your code should not be called
from firewall chain. IPsec sits at socket layer. As minimum, you have
to teach socket, that it should not fragment packet.
Essentially, it means that ip_build_xmit is bypassed as whole
and policy decisions are made before you started to create buffer.
If you will transform packet, ip_build_xmit is uselless overhead,
it is so complicated because it is optimized for direct read, combined
with checksumming.

Nobody prohibited you to reallocate it at any convenient moment.
Especially, after you decided to use virtual devices.

Also both they use a bit different formatting conventions, KR C
and names sort of "ourfinisacked". Insert underscores, and you will
see no differences more. 8)
