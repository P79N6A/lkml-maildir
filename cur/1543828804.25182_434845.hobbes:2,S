Subject: [PATCH 2/25] irq: Add moved_masked_irq
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/20/463

Currently move_native_irq disables and renables the irq we are
migrating to ensure we don't take that irq when we are actually
doing the migration operation.  Disabling the irq needs to
happen but sometimes doing the work is move_native_irq is too late.
On x86 with ioapics the irq move sequences needs to be:
edge_triggered:
  mask irq.
  move irq.
  unmask irq.
  ack irq.
level_triggered:
  mask irq.
  ack irq.
  move irq.
  unmask irq.
We can esasily perform the edge triggered sequence, with the current
defintion of move_native_irq.  However the level triggered case does
not map well.  For that I have added move_masked_irq, to allow
me to disable the irqs around both the ack and the move.
Q: Why have we not seen this problem earlier?
A: The only symptom I have been able to reproduce is that if we change
   the vector before acknowleding an irq the wrong irq is acknowledged.
   Since we currently are not reprogramming the irq vector during
   migration no problems show up.
   We have to mask the irq before we acknowledge the irq or else we could
   hit a window where an irq is asserted just before we acknowledge it.
   Edge triggered irqs do not have this problem because acknowledgements
   do not propogate in the same way.
