between __cacheline_aligned_in_smp and other compile time bits based on
VSMP specific INTERNODE_CACHE, etc. I think compile time the way to go.

No hypervisor change needed.  Just the pv backend needs to return 0 or
X86_EFLAGS_IF for save_flags (and similar translation on restore_flags).
Xen uses a simple shared memory flag and does something which you could
roughly translate into this:
	xen_save_flags()
	if (xen_vcpu_interrupts_enabled)
		return X86_EFLAGS_IF;
	else
		return 0;
This doesn't require any hypervisor changes.  Similarly, VSMP could do
something along the lines of:
	vsmp_save_flags()
	flags = native_save_flags();
	if (flags & X86_EFLAGS_IF) || (flags & X86_EFLAGS_AC)
		return X86_EFLAGS_IF;
	else
		return 0;

Probably not.  It's mostly native and I'm not sure it would want the
bits disabled from if (paravirt_enabled()) tests.
