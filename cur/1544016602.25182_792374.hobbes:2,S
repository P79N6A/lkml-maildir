This can be done (IA64 does it today), but it's not generically useful.  You can use it to frob a few simple values, but it means you can't store any pointers, and that just doesn't fly in general kernel code.

I used to be convinced it had to grow, but Christoph showed otherwise.  Nonetheless, it's an annoying restriction which is going to bite us in the ass repeatedly as coders use per_cpu on random sizes.
