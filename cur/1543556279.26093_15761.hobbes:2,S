There is nothing relevant in the errata, unfortunately...

No, 82559ER has its own PCI id, 0x1209. There is also a newer 82559 chip
which reports a different PCI device id, 0x1030 (I have one of those).
For the old chips reporting 0x1229, revisions 1-3 are 82557, revisions
4-5 are 82558 and revisions 6-8 are 82559.
