I disagree it's unsolvable:
1) At some point in the -rc cycle, you put your foot down and say 
"nothing but bugfixes."
2) Indicate this foot-stomp in a manner that a script can easily notice.
That's all the 2.4.x's -pre/-rc accomplishes.  It encourages people to 
test, by telling them when their testing would be most useful.
