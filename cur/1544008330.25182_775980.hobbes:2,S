Subject: [PATCH 0/6] integrity
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset contains the LIM and IMA integrity system patches.
To address concerns raised on the mailing list of the IMA patch
size, the IMA patch has been broken up into three smaller patches
for easier review.
1 - TPM internal interfaces (unchanged)
2 - LIM - (minor cleanup)
3 - IMA - Main (updates in response to comments)
4 - IMA - securityfs - display (unchanged)
5 - IMA - securityfs - policy (unchanged)
6 - (credential patch for security-testing-2.6/next)
The first five patches apply cleanly to linux-2.6.28-rc6 and with minor
offsets to security-testing-2.6/#next. The last patch addresses the
security-testing-2.6/#next credential merge issues.
Mimi Zohar (6):
  integrity: TPM internel kernel interface
  integrity: Linux Integrity Module(LIM)
  integrity: IMA as an integrity service provider
  integrity: IMA display
  integrity: IMA policy
  integrity: replace task uid with cred uid
