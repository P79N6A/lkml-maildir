Make sure your TZ variable has been set properly (in /etc/profile)
export TZ=US/Eastern
      Then make it take effect like
. /etc/profile                          # Execute /etc/profile
      Then reset your system time like
rdate time-a.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov       # Set time to NIST
      Then set your CMOS clock
hwclock -systohc
This should make everything fine. If you set your clock to NIST,
or to the national time-server in the country or your choice,
every time you startup and connect to a network or if your
machine is 'up' all the time, have crond (man cron) set it once
a day.
