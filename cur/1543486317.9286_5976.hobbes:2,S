Hi
I was encounterd a problem using traffic shaper. When i tries shape
ethernet interface(eth4) to speed 14400 my machine just stops
after ~10 of working(without any oops or other error message, simply not
responding). I'm using linux 2.2.1 on 486sx33 working as router with five
ethernet interfaces. There is my comands to start shaping:
shapecfg attach shaper0 eth4
shapecfg speed 14400 eth4
ifconfig shaper0 my.ip.add.ress netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast
bro.ad.ca.st up
route add -net my.net.wo.rk netmask 255.255.255.0 dev dhaper0
