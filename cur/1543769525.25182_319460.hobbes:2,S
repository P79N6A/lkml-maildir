Hi Andrew and Dominik,
Since mm2, udev cannot rename my pcmcia wireless interface.
rc4 and rc4-mm1 successfully rename it from eth0 to wifi.
rc4-mm2 only renames the internal interface, not the pcmcia wifi one.
When I insert the card, This line appears in syslog:
udev[9500]: configured rule in '/etc/udev/rules.d/brice.rules[4]'
applied, 'eth0' becomes 'wifi'
But the interface is still called eth0.
Any idea ?
Thanks,
Brice
PS: Richard Purdie's patch (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/18/303
) fixed my
previous cardctl breakage, but it doesn't change anything regarding this
bug.
