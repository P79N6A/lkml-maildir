Hello,
This series of patches add the ability to make mutex locks killable
instead of uninterruptable.
This patch set builds on willys 5 patches for TASK_KILLABLE that are
currently in mm (see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/18/423
 for more
details).  I have used 2.6.24-rc3 with the addition of willys patches.
The first patch adds the mutex_lock_killable to the kernel/mutex.c and
kernel/mutex.h.
The second patch is a use of the mutex_lock_killable to fs/readdir.c
to use the new mutex_lock_killable.  This was enough for a small test
application to be killable once the ethernet was pulled on an nfs
mount (please note that this does not allow a normal ls to be killed
yet).
akpm: can you take these for merge in 2.6.25?
A big thanks to Matthew for all the help on these patches.
Please CC me on any responses.
Thanks,
Liam R. Howlett
