Thanks, still it is unclear to me why are we
downsizing the advertised window(rcv_wnd) to cwnd? 
To defeat disobeying sender, or something like below?
Suppose when wscale is zero, it is now checking mss > 1,
and perhaps the intention was to check mss > rcv_wnd,
where mss is greater than advertised, and we still
want to advertise window to spwan 2 to 4 cwnd packets.
And also in the following line,
if (*rcv_wscale && sysctl_tcp_app_win && space>=mss &&
                    space - max((space>>sysctl_tcp_app_win), mss>>*rcv_wscale) <
65536/2)
space is actual_space>>rcv_wscale, mss is actual value.
Why are we checking space>=mss, which are in different
scales? The second line is doing max on space and mss 
on same scales, and looks right.
Thanks,
Prasanna.
