Do you mean that egcs version shipped in RH60 is not of production
quality? I've had a weird problem which dissapeared by itself and points
at egcs, I would say. Kernels up to 2.2.9 compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3 on
RH52 worked fine on the same system after its upgrading to RH60. My first
2.2.9 kernel compiled on RH60 refused to load ide-cd module. The other day
egcs produced a working ide-cd.
