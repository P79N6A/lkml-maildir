I think it doesn't matter because the buffer_under_min() check just
protect the buffer cache enough. In arca-vm-22 I removed the specific
buffer and cache min limitis so I applyed Zlatko patch ;).
Basically arca-vm-22 take the sum of the buffermem+page_cache_size always
close to a percentage tunable via sysctl (10% as default) when _low_ on
memory. So the buffer aging now make sense to me (not benchmarked though
;).
Somebody in the list asked for an algorithm that doens't work with magic
but it's tunable. Having a constant cache+buffermem memory size under
swapping seems to work very well and even if it doesn't work with magic I
like it right now.
