For that matter, I've been seeing a few (roughly 4 or so) of those
`VM: killing process modprobe' messages upon booting a new kernel version 
for the first time for quite a while. They're always followed by a ton 
of complaints about modules.dep not being available (yet). Of course, 
a few steps down the line modules.dep gets created from within rc.modules 
and on the next reboot everything runs fine. 
I'm on 2.3.33 now.
