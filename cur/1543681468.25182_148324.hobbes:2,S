You can already use Device-Mapper to create "partitions" on your loop devices, 
so there's not much of a reason to add partitioning support to the loop 
driver itself. There are a variety of tools you can use to set them up: EVMS, 
LVM2, dmsetup, and I think there is/was a simple partitioning tool that uses 
DM (dmpartx?).
