No - I introduced a correct fix.
I think actually we're heading towards needing Linux V2 - the rewrite.
It seems that fixing simple bugs cause other bugs, and that means we're
heading into a maintainability nightmare.

No idea I'm afraid, and since I've had a _really_ extremely shitty couple
of days I'm not about to start going to look for it.

... which would be the genhd layer - it's keeping the driverfs_dev
around so that the genhd layer can generate hotplug events using it
at mount/umount time.  Thanks for just re-confirming my original fix
and that it's SCSI which is the real problem. 8)
