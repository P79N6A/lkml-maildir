But nobody know such extensions.
I think that the core kernel will remain in C, because
there are no problems and no improvement possible
(with other language)
But the drivers side has more problems. There is a lot
of copy-paste, quality is often not high, not all developers
know well linux kernel, and not well maintained with new
or better internal API. So if we found a good template
or a good language to help *some* drivers without
causing a lot of problem to the rest of community, it would
be nice.
I don't think that we have written in stone that kernel
drivers should be written only in C, but actually there is
no good alternative.
But I think it is a huge task to find a language, a
prototype of API and convert some testing drivers.
And there is no guarantee of good result.
