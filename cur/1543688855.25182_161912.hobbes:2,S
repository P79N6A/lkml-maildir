I gave this patch a try...  All data concerning my computer (config
files, boot messages, dsdt, etc.) is available on
<
http://perso.nerim.net/~tudia/bug-reports>.
On my computer, echoing anything to /sys/power/state does nothing at all.
Not even a line in the logs.
On the text console (but with XFree and kde running in the background),
        echo 1 > /proc/acpi/sleep
        the screen blinks and the fan speed goes up. (fan speed is set by
        bios. Loading module i2c reinitialize the motherboard sensors and
        make fan speed go up too. But here, i2c was not loaded nor
        compiled in.) In the logs, I have:

        Note that, sometimes, the computer waits after printing "Entering
        sleep state [S1]", and resumes if I hit the key. The screen is
        however fully lit, so I am not sure that this is a success.
        echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep
        Maybe the screen blinks a little bit, but I am not sure. It is so
        fast... In the logs, I have:
PM: Preparing system for suspend
Stopping tasks:
=========================================================|
Restarting tasks... done
        echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep
        Suspend is working, the computer writes things in the swapfile
        and shuts down. On resume, I have a kernel panic. I have hand
        written this:
Process swapper
