Which list do you think has more people interested? ppc64 or alsa?
Pretty much anybody with a G5 will probably be on the ppc lists. And 
_nobody_ will be on the alsa lists, since it historically has never had 
any sound at all.
In other words, don't believe that "sound" means that it must be an alsa 
list. Lists make sense not because of intent, but because of who they 
reach.
