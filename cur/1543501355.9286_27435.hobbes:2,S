So, I see no way that this can be transparent to the user with 
non-albod-aware applications.
Just imagine:
$ ls -l
total 2
-rw-r--r--   1 larry      users           13 Jul  1 11:59 file.c
ls
$ ls -l \\file.c\
total 6
-rw-r--r--   1 larry      users          789 Jul  1 12:02 default
-rw-r--r--   1 larry      users          456 Jul  1 12:02 fancy-editor-saved-state
-rw-r--r--   1 larry      users          123 Jul  1 12:02 icon
$ vi \\file.c/default   (a big pain)
$ gcc \\file.c/default  (oh no, gcc doesn't even know its a .c file!)
Nobody will use this for files that don't strictly have to be in 
albod format unless *everything* is albod-aware.  Otherwise it will
be a big pain no matter where it is implemented.
As for applications that are written specifically to use albods, 
they could just as easily use a fancy file format and not be
limited to one FS on one OS.
