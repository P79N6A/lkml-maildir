compile is
from Makefile:
HOSTCC          = kgcc
kgcc --version = egcs-2.91.66
athelon 1.2 Ghz / 266fsb
I am checking weather this is bios related, it seems that by default or
after the bios upgrade one of my RAM settings was set to 4-way interleave.
I think it is possible that this caused the oops.
