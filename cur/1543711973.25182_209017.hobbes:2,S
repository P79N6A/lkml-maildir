I made that one line change to my 2.6.3 kernel from gentoo and it fixed the problem for both the ISO/UDF and UDF discs (I couldn't try the ISO only disc since I don't have it anymore).  I also tried a few CDs to get a rough check for whether it introduced new errors, but they were fine also.  Please let me know if I should do any further testing, and THANKS!
