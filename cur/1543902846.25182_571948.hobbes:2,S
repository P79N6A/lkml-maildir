The sysfs crashes are all over; the first I saw is the BUG_ON() in
kernel_param_sysfs_setup(); but it was changing during the bisect
and in other similar sysfs BUG_ON()s too.
During one bisect state I also had a crash in kmalloc itself. I right
now don't have it anymore; do you want me to restart the bisect go
recreate it?
x86-64 kernels BTW work just fine; just something seems to be broken
with i386.
Unfortunately newsetup seems to have broken argument passing to qemu
so it's a bit difficult to get more out of it.

Userland is not reached yet. You can just use a dummy dd if=/dev/zero of=.... bs=1M count=1
file.
