In this case it would make more sense to get 2.6.9.1 released as quickly 
as possible instead of trying to fix old releases.
An important aspect to keep in mind is that 2.6.8.1 is an official release 
and people (which not necessarily read lkml and don't complain yet) expect 
being able to upgrade from one release to the next by applying a single 
incremental patch. Making an official patch release against some earlier 
release will certainly cause confusion.
bye, Roman
