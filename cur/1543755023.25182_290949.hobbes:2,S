Me too. (2.6.11-rc2-bk3, openoffice.org-1.1.3) I straced soffice and found
it hanging on /dev/dri:
geteuid32()                             = 500
stat64("/dev/dri", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=80, ...}) = 0
stat64("/dev/dri/card14", 0xbff9c8bc)   = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
munmap(0x9b4838, 8192)                  = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
munmap(0x949e248, 3220820000)           = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) @ 0 (0) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
and with a chmod a+rw /dev/dri/card* everything is okay until I reboot,
and it defaults back to crw-rw----
What is at fault? Certainly oo shouldn't just seg-fault, but should the
permissions on /dev/dri/card* be crw-rw---- or crw-rw-rw-?
