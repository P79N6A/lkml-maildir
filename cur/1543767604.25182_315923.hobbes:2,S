So you want it to schedule that big image (Evolution) that's already used 5
minutes of CPU since it started (this morning, admittedly) in preference to
that cc1 process that will be gone before it's used 2 seconds of CPU, plus all
the disk I/O that cc1 performs (hopefully the cache will help here, but it may
indeed go to disk to read the source files)?
