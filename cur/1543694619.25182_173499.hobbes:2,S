It also depends on a lot on the compiler version. On 2.95 
it was common wisdom that -Os is often fastest, but that changed
in later versions.
Best would be actually a mix of both - setting it case by case.
That's already done in specific cases, e.g. ACPI is always compiled
with -Os. This could be done for other files which are clearly
slow path too.
Profile feedback is unfortunately not an option because it is too
unpredictable and causes maintenance problems.
