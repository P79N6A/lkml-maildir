MP systems are getting more and more popular.  For them the requirement for
caches will continue to exist.  Even Cray started to using instruction
caches for the SV vectors; good 'ole Seymour would probably commit suicide
if he'd know that ;-) Large efforts in CPU and bus systems over the last
years has gone into technique which allows to tolerate latencies.  The
R10000 is one example; probably the most interesting ideas are being used in
Tera's proprietary architecture of a multithreaded CPU.  The actual hope is
that these techniques combined with faster RAM technologies of the future
will provide a short enough latency to allow CPUs to keep busy most of the
time.
