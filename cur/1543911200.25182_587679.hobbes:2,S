Hm, those items should consume all the memory, but it should be freed if
you have memory pressure from other places.  Does it cause the machine
to lock up, or you just got scared when seeing them?
Oh, and does the same thing happen if you do not use SLUB, but rather
the older SLAB?

I don't see any sysfs accesses there, only usbfs accesses.
And it looks like a very dumb program, iterating over all usb devices
all the time?  You would think that it would not do that, otherwise your
power consumption is going to be very high, and the odds that a new usb
device is going to show up that quickly is pretty low.
