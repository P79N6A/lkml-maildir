Ouch. I see what you're referring to: if *readdir() fails, the devfs
entry is not cleaned up. I've fixed that in my tree, as well as made
the (minor) optimisation of avoiding re-taking the parent lock on
error.

Well, I *have* looked at it. But after a while, it gets harder to spot
bugs because it gets stale. That's why a fresh pair of eyes is so
valuable.

How about just letting me know about all the bugs you find? I would
find that helpful.

I find it hard to believe that the code is ripe with bugs. While there
may be one or two bugs still lurking, the code overall looks to be in
pretty good shape. All the work I put into adding the locking and
refcounting has paid off. Is it just bad luck that you randomly looked
at devfs_readdir() and found one of the (hopefully few) bugs? Or have
you actually seen a large number of bugs that justifies the "ripe"
label?
I could just go and read the code periodically, looking for bugs, but
I'd quickly burn out, and the incremental benefit would likely be
minor. A fresh pair of eyeballs is much better. And that is supposed
to be the power of open source.
