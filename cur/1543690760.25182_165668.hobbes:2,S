Subject: intel D865PERL and DMA for disks (IDE)?

   I am trying to set the DMA for ide disks but get the following error:
   jojda:/home/erik# hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
  setting using_dma to 1 (on)
  HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
  using_dma    =  0 (off)
   is it because it's not supported on given chipset or is there 
something I can do?
   debian unstable
   2.4.21-ac4 (+ libata5 patches from Jeff Garzik)
   Intel D865PERL motherboard
   there are only two kernel options that I can see are relevant to 
chipset I use:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX=m
CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_PIIX=y
   TIA
