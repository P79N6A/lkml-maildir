time_is_after_jiffies(foo) means: time "foo" is after the current value 
of the variable "jiffies" (which is used throughout the kernel as the 
current time).
You are interpreting it as: the current time is after time "foo" (which 
is in jiffies).
The reason why your interpretation is incorrect is that "jiffies" is a 
specific variable in and of itself, and not a modifier for "foo".

You're using "jiffies" as a modifier for "foo", when it is actually a 
separate variable.  This makes your version just as ambiguous.
If you really want to change it, removing "jiffies" from the name (and 
thus removing any ambiguity) may make more sense.  Something like:
time_is_after(foo)
which would mean that the current value of "jiffies" is after "foo".
