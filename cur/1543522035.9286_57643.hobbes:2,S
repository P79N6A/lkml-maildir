Defining aio_sendfile() would solve the immediate problem, but doing it that
way would not allow invoking sendfile() from lio_listio().
Sure, you could define an AIO_SENDFILE value for the aio_lio_opcode field 
of the aiocb structure, but unless you extend aiocb as I suggested,
there's nothing for that opcode to work with.
I'm not saying a lot of people (or anyone) uses lio_listio(), but it's
part of the Single Unix Standard (see
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/lio_listio.html
)
and if we want our asynch sendfile stuff to fit into SUS someday,
we'd better not adopt an interface that would make that impossible.
To answer your concern about defining a special meaning for aio_buf being NULL,
I'm happy with defining aio_sendfile(struct aiocb *aiocbp), but 
let's add the two fields I suggested rather than adding arguments;
aio_ calls generally have just one argument, and aio_sendfile shouldn't be an 
exception.
