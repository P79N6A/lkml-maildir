+ * struct class_device - class devices
+ * @class: pointer to the parent class for this class device.  This is required.
+ * @devt: for internal use by the driver core only.
+ * @node: for internal use by the driver core only.
+ * @kobj: for internal use by the driver core only.
+ * @devt_attr: for internal use by the driver core only.
+ * @dev: if set, a symlink to the struct device is created in the sysfs
+ * directory for this struct class device.
+ * @class_data: pointer to whatever you want to store here for this struct
+ * class_device.  Use class_get_devdata() and class_set_devdata() to get and
+ * set this pointer.
+ * @parent: pointer to a struct class_device that is the parent of this struct
+ * class_device.  If NULL, this class_device will show up at the root of the
+ * struct class in sysfs (which is probably what you want to have happen.)
+ * @release: pointer to a release function for this struct class_device.  If
+ * set, this will be called instead of the class specific release function.
+ * Only use this if you want to override the default release function, like
+ * when you are nesting class_device structures.
+ * @hotplug: pointer to a hotplug function for this struct class_device.  If
+ * set, this will be called instead of the class specific hotplug function.
+ * Only use this if you want to override the default hotplug function, like
+ * when you are nesting class_device structures.
