It would be interesting but I'm not sure it would work. I guess
if these chips are in OHCI 1.0 mode the 1.1 functionality may be
unavailable (the datasheet seems to suggest that).
OTOH I think it's better to change the EEPROM contents anyway,
it's a simple program (which I'm going to write when I'm a bit
less loaded).
I wonder if OHCI 1.0 hardware based on VT6307 (and 6306) is
a common thing, or is it just an exception.
