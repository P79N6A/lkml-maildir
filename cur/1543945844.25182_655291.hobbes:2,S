As is shown in the dmesg, it is 2.6.24.1.

Can't really say for sure.  At least it already happened with 2.6.23.9.

This is really difficult to determine, since the event is pretty hard to
reproduce.  I'll try to investigate more, then. :/  This one happened pretty
much right after a reboot due to a completely frozen machine (no Oops or Eeek
whatsoever) apparently due to intensive writing to the parallel port (the
kernel complained that "FIFO write timed out" twice before locking up).
Of course I do suspect a hardware problem, but since last time I had similarly
strange things it ended up being due to misconfiguration, I still hope
someone will tell me this is also the case here.
