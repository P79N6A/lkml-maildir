  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In general, there's obviously nothing wrong with ia64's policy of discarding
.exit.text at link time (in fact it's a good optimization), and generally most
references from .init.text (or .text) to .exit.text would really be oopsen.
But not so with this case, because with HOTPLUG_CPU=n (which is when
this link error can occur) it's not possible for the notifier to be
called out in
the first place, and especially not for a CPU_DEAD event, which is when
this reference could've occurred in practice.
Anyway, I came across another little thing while investigating this, patch
attached ...

[PATCH] ia64 perfmon: Remove exit_pfm_fs()
Because it is dead code and not referenced by anybody else (that file
cannot be built modular).
