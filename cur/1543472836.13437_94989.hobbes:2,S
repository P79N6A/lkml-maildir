  The same bug as in 131 - the ATI Mach64 fb entry in make xconfig is 
not clickable. I fixed this (on my machine) by removing other ATI Mach 64
fb entries (ATARI , PPC and sparc) in linux/drivers/video/Config.in , but
it's not a fix for everyone else.
  Can somebody more knowledgable about Config.in files fix this ? The
problem apparently is that multiple appearances of the same field
interfere.
