Hello
It seems like you have pointed out the problem... From what you had sent 
previously (the output of 'lspci' on your machine), and what the Intel 
doc says, it looks to me like the code for i830 initialization is not 
correct for your version of the chipset. But I am not too sure of what 
is to be done in that case... should we switch back to a 'classic' AGP 
initialization, similar to the other i8xx chipsets (820/840/860...) ? 
Robert (or somebody else), any clue about this one ?
I'll try to figure out where the 'i830_configure' performs call on the 
secondary device...
Best regards
