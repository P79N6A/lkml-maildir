Hi guys,
	I got this mail from _someone_ asking me for help on /proc/gcov, I
guess he did not know about lkml. Since I don't know about modules in
linux. I thought of forwarding the mail on to you.

Hello,
I got your id from google..
I have just started working on kernel code coverage project...
I have patched my kernel and i have configured the gcov kernel module support.
I compilied my module and i run insmod and i got my module executed.
But i am not getting the .da file in /proc/gcov/kernel for my module...
my sample module looks somthing like this,
#include<linux/module.h>
#include<linux/kernel.h>
#include<linux/config.h>
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
int init_module (void){
         printk("HELLO WORLD");
         return 0;
}
void cleanup_module (void){
         printk ("In cleanup module NTPL \n");
}
the commands are as follows...
1.  gcc  -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -DLINUX -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-strict-aliasing
     -c -o test.o -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage  test.c
2.  insmod gcov-proc.o
3.  insmod test.o
         This must generate a test.da file in /proc/gcov/kernel/
according to a manual i have but i am not
         getting this file generated...
I am using :
               kernel version linux-2.4.18
               gcc compiler version 3.0.4
Please tell me where i am going wrong.
Please help me out...
Thanking you,
Prashanth M D

My gutt feeling after some searches is that the guy forgot to apply the patch 
modutils-2.4.12-gcov.diff 
specified at 
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/gcov-kernel.readme
