Have you considered having a tree just for the shared code and links 
where appropriate? If nothing else that would make it blindingly obvious 
  that the code was shared, and avoid having someone do something 
unsharable because s/he didn't know there was a pointer to the code 
elsewhere.
I know it's slightly more complex, but also slightly safer.
