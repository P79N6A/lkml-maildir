OK, I thought he was building with the latest patch (attached here),
which adds the 'select WAN' reverse dependency.
I tested his .config with the patch (minus the Makefile portion) and
it builds just fine.
There is nothing random about these select statements.
They are chosen specifically to fix the dependencies.
You may feel they are ugly, but 'select' is the only tool
I know of that fixes these errors without losing flexibility.
