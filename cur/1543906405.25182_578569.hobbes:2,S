This believe is primarily based on my observations of multiple benchmark 
runs and also on your statement earlier: »in the SMP migration code, the 
'old scheduler' indeed picks the lowest priority one«.
Perhaps it is just an unfortunate coincidence that at ~90% of the time a 
migration decision is made, the higher priority process is currently 
cache hot whereas the lower priority process is not. That would be 
unlucky for me as I would like to decide upon specific runtime 
circumstances whether the highest or the lowest priority job of a 
runqueue should be migrated to another CPU. :-/
