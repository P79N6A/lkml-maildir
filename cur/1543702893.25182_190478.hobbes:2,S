Might as well turn it off completely. You have an Nvidia card, and
that isn't supported by DRI. (AGPGART is just a soft-dependancy for AGP
based cards that DRI supports)

Apart from the integrated chipsets from Intel/VIA etc sadly, there's really
not much in the graphics world that has 100% opensource drivers any more.
Basically, forget it for the high performance end of the market.
(And these days, even most of the commodity stuff (NVIDIA, ATI etc) falls
 into that bracket)
