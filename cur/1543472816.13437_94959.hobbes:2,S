Hello!
I am operating a dual-Pentium II server at a college in Germany. I used to
use Linux 2.0.35, but I experienced occasional lock-ups. I thought it was
worth an attempt to upgrade to a later kernel, so I tried 2.0.36. The
machine locked up during the kernel boot, where it says it is downloading
sequencer code to scsi0 (I have two Adaptec 2940UW in that machine). I
then tried out 2.1.132pre4. Same thing here. I finally noticed that my
BIOS says during bootup, that scsi0 is sitting on PCI 11/0, and scsi1 is
at PCI 12/0. The 2.0.35 comes to the same result, and easily initializes
my two SCSI-controllers. 2.0.36 and 2.1.132pre4 both say they found scsi0
at PCI 6/0! Once I found that out I recompiled 2.1.132pre4 with a
different set of PCI options. I removed PCI quirks-support, and I removed
the Linux-PCI-scan. I figured this was a smart move, since my BIOS was
obviously getting the PCI settings right. Unfortunately, it didn't help
:-(
I think this needs fixing. This is a popular ASUS-board, with a
brandnew Award Modular BIOS, and Adaptec 2940UW SCSI, so I guess a number
of people will use the same kind of configuration. If I can provide you
with any additional information I will gladly do so.
Cheers,
Tilo Christ
