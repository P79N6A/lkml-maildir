Dell Inspiron 7500VT (Pentium-II 400, 128 MB RAM, BIOS A14): no go when
ACPI is enabled. System hangs after the
  ACPI: System description tables loaded
message.  System boots fine with APM, but the Xircom Combi-Card (not
using the kernel drivers!) does not work. Will try with kernel drivers
ASAP.
Yours,
