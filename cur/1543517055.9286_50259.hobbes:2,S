I'm interested in recieving remote control protocol over an IRDA port.
To do this, I need to get a series of bytes/overruns/parity errors/...
from the serial port, with accurate timing (to within 10us or so, if 
possible)
AIUI, a userspace solution is impossible.
I suspect something heavily borrowing from the serial driver, which 
instead of returning bytes, returned arrays of timestamps+events.
Thoughts?
