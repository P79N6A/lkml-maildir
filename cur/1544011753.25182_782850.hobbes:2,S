You mean something like "BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 1179869794s!"?
I had similar lockups, also on 2.6.26 (amd64).
It turned out to be related to frequency scaling on the host. With 
frequency scaling enabled, I was able to lock up the VM within minutes 
by periodically switching between full load and idle. (running burnMMX 
for a few seconds and then sleeping for a few seconds in a loop)
After setting scaling_min_freq to the same value as scaling_max_freq, 
virtual machines became rock solid.
BTW often the lockups were not complete, but the VM resumed work after a 
while. (IIRC, ~1/2 hour, for sure much less than 1179869794s :-) )
