non-PCI works quite easily under 2.6.x, because libata core uses the 
generic DMA mapping lib.  It's already confirmed to work on at least one 
other ARM embedded chipset (sorry can't give more detail).
2.4.x is a lot of work to do non-PCI, largely because you have to deal 
with the lack of a generic DMA interface.  2.4.x libata is hardcoded to 
use PCI DMA mapping.
