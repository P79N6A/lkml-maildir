True, that's faster.

Oh, that's right. I didn't look carefully enough at
preconfigure_ali_port()...

From the PnP output that Andrey sent, it seems that 0x130 might work.
If not, I guess it's worth trying at 0x100 while assuming it's the same
register setting as 0x130 or 0x178, so basically applying this patch on
top of Bjorn's one:
diff --git a/drivers/net/irda/smsc-ircc2.c b/drivers/net/irda/smsc-ircc2.c

and then a modprobe smsc-ircc2 ircc_fir=0x100,ircc_sir=0x02e8
Cheers,
