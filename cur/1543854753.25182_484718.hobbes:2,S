Recently i noticed an (in my eyes) unexplainable memory loss, I
couldn't trace it a specific process, the slab, buffers or any of the
usual places.
cat /proc/meminfo revealed something called anonpages, which seemed to
be around a 100 MiB large.
I have no idea what they are, searching the mailinglist archives or
using a conventional search engine didn't yield anything usefull.
Can anyone enlighten a curious user?
Sincerely,
Maarten Maathuis.
