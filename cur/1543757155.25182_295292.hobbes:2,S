A custom rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/00_logitech.rules:
> KERNEL="event*", SYSFS{idVendor}="046d", SYSFS{idProduct}="c50e" NAME="input/event-mx1000" SYMLINK="input/%k"
> KERNEL="mouse*", SYSFS{idVendor}="046d", SYSFS{idProduct}="c50e" NAME="input/mouse-mx1000" SYMLINK="input/%k"
gets event-mx1000 and mouse-mx1000 rules, with compatibility symlinks
for other configurations. This is basically so don't have to tell evdev
where exactly on the USB hierarchy the mouse is. (You'll note that my
xorg.conf lacks the Phys descriptor line). I can now plug my mouse into
different ports, or ports on a hub, and still have it work ok.

This certainly seems to be the convention. Just like programs interpret
buttons 4 and 5 as vertical scrolling, they interpret 6 and 7 as the
horizontal scrollers. GTK, mozilla, galeon, and firefox all go by this
principal, so you don't actually need to use a program like xbindkeys to
fake keyboard events.
(Mozilla/galeon/firefox use the horizontal scroll for backward/foreward
by default. You can change this by setting
> mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.action = 0
> mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.numlines = 1
> mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.sysnumlines = true
in about:config. )
