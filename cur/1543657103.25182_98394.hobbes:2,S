Oh dear. I checked my C9x draft copy and you seem to be right.
The standard states that sizeof(struct a1) == offsetof(struct a1, c),
but both gcc (2.95.3 and 3.2) and Intel's icc (7.0) get it wrong on x86:
they make sizeof(struct a1) == 8 but offsetof(struct a1, c) == 6.
Technically speaking, the kernel code which uses 'entries[0]' is
non-compliant since the proper syntax is 'entries[]', but the empty
array size syntax isn't implemented in gcc 2.95.3.

My mistake. The old code is Ok for C99, but broken for ANSI-C.

Yes, this should be changed as you suggest. The old code only
works in C99-compliant implementations, but we now know that both
gcc and icc get this wrong, so it seems prudent to revert to
the classical formulation, using the 'entries[0]' declaration
syntax and offsetof() instead of sizeof().
