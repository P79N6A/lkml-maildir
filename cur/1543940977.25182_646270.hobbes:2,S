Which is not at all what I suggested.  When you want to set up a
straw man to argue against, please don't involve me!
First steps are after all followed by second steps, and often
by third steps.  It's not "overengineering" to recognize when
those steps necessarily have a direction.
In this case, that direction is "working on more hardware", so
evaluating the interface proposal against several types of
hardware is a good way to review it.  The hardware I referenced
doesn't seem "fringe" to me; it's used on more Linux systems
and by more users than the Synopsys design.  And I've seen some
of the same issues on other DMA controllers:  priority, options
for synchronization (e.g. after DMAREQ is signaled), and more.
In that vein, doesn't SuperH have DMA controllers to fit into this
proposed interface?  I don't know about such "fringe" hardware
myself, but it'd be good to know if this proposal is sufficient
for the needs of drivers there.
