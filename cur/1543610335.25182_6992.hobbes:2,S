Hi There
I have a wonderfull HP omnibook 600C lying around here. It is a monster
machine with a 486-50Mhz and 4Mb ram. The hdd system is based on pcmcia
harddrives but mine is long gone to lala-land (badblocks everywhere).
So I thought of installing a CompactFlash card with a complete linux
system on it. Because of wear on the flash part I have to do without
swap. And as I only have 4Mb ram on the system I have to conserve that
also. So a couple of questions:
1. Are there any patches for making linux run from a CF card?
2. Anybody know anyting about making a XIP linux disk? (all code stays on
the CF card, only datastructures and the like eat up the little memory I
have)?
Any hint, pointer, anything will be greatly appriciated :)
Regards Thomas, Denmark
