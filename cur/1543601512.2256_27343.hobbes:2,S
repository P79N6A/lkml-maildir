Subject: ext3/ext2 compatibility; time for ext3 in mainline kernel?

I installed Red Hat 7.2beta, and chose its nifty ext3 option when
setting up my partitions.  But now when I boot into vanilla 2.4.9,
some files are mysteriously missing, notably /usr/bin/id and
/usr/lib/libreadline.so.3, judging from the error messages that spew
when I try to do anything.
I guess either a) there's a bug, or b) ext3 isn't so compatible with ext2
that you can just boot into an ext2-only kernel and expect things to work.
If b) is true, I'd really really like vanilla 2.4.11 or so to support ext3.
Isn't it about time?
