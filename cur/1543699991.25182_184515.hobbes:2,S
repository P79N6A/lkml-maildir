| Hey, I've tried to kill it off, but people keep on wanting it. Either

And MO drives. There was something funky with LS-120 and ZIP drives that
ide-scsi did right and ide-floppy didn't, but I haven't tried it since
about 2.5.4x, and at that time ide-scsi worked, other than logging some
status messages.
There is some MS backup software which wants SCSI tapes to run. I don't
know if that's under wine or vmware, it's on my list of things to check
and report, but down the list. One more reason for ide-scsi, though.

I think there are a fair number of people who care, they just don't
happen to have the combination of skills, hardware, and time to go play.
Don't take it out, let people grouse and eventually fixes will come,
if only from vendors.

1 - testing and reporting problems IS doing something.
2 - you supplied a patch which did fix some of the problems.
3 - I got another tape drive so I could test on non-production hardware
    and it died, haven't tried the replacement because we have had
    blizzards two bleeping weekends in a row. And this weekend is
    Christmas prep weekend, so don't expect nice test results this year.
4 - We now have three rescued kittens in the house, they are LOTS more
    fun to play with than ide-scsi ;-)

And hopefully the person who reported MO problems will test, because I
believe that was one of his major problems.
