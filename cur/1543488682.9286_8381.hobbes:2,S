The other part was bogus. Excuse me. It was only a guess and was wrong.
Now I know exactly which is the problem.

The wakeup is completly unrelated. The problem is that we are not able to
get data in the receiver.

No the change you are proposing will fix nothing and is completly
unrelated. Even if we would pass select() we would then deadlock in
recv(2). I'll send you my real fix that I finished now though (hoping
you'll agree that I did a right choice but that choice looks the only safe
choice to avoid a receiver deadlocking to me).
