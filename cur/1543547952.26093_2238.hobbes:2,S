Then why not allow more complex post-failure analysis tools into the
kernel as an option to debuggers?  I agree that debugging should not
act as a crutch for poor design up front, but at the same time, once
you ship a product, you can't just ask the customer to "drop down into
the debugger and give me a stack trace".  If the system doesn't save
the crash state for you, you might as well wave a magic wand over the
system or pray that someone can read an Oops report.
