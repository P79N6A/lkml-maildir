Subject: Still IRQ routing problems with VIA (was: VIA KT133 chipset PCI crazyness...)

Several weeks ago there had been a thread on the pirq assignments of newer VIA
and SiS chipsets ending with everybody happy.
Everybody? Not everybody - there is a small village of chipsets resisting the
advent of 2.4.x :(
The system is a KT133A (MSI's K7T Turbo MS-6330 board)/Duron 700
system. Kernel 2.4.x have IRQ routing problems and USB failures (the latter
will most probably be due to IRQ mismatches, I believe).
2.2 kernel = 2.2.17 RH-kernel
2.4 kernel = 2.4.3 kernel with 'yes ""|make config' (I also tried configuring
             and -ac3 patches to no avail.)
I attached dmesg, lspci -vvvxxx (under both 2.2 and 2.4), and dump_irq (which
is the same for both kernels)
As far as I could follow the discussion back in January a problem seem to be
that different chipset vendors may arbitrary map pirq to links ('A' vs 1
etc.). On my board I see that there is a rather strange mapping. Maybe this
confuses 2.4.3?
Most prominent difference in the lspci -vvvxxx output (to me) is the interrupt
with the unknown pin:

Maybe it is a KT133A != KT133 issue. Note that the analysis above is the best
I can provide, which has nothing to do with a good analysis.
Any help mostly appreciated! My board wants to run 2.4.x!!!
BTW kernel 2.2.x does not give any irq related messages in its logs. Does this
mean that 2.2.x works well, or that the errors are just not displayed?
Thanks, Axel.
