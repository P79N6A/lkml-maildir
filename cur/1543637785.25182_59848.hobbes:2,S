Well, that would most likely be my fault.  I made some small changes to
the parameter parsing code recently.

The no display symptom makes sense if there's a problem in a setup
routine.  These routines are called before console_init.  Printk's
before console_init are queued up and only displayed after console_init
is called.  If the kernel hangs before this point, nothing is displayed.

The changes went in in 2.5.27.
Can you please send my your .config file?  I'll look at this tonight.
Thanks.
Gerald
