Indeed, sounds much more like a /dev thing than a /proc thing
at this point ;-)

Ummm ... how do we make /proc smaller than 1 file to open per PID?
It's pretty easy to get it down that far. But it still sucks.

stand a chance in hell of scaling a little bit. So I took a very 
quick look ... what syscalls are you reduced to per pid, one ioctl
