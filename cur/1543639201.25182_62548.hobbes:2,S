folks, please keep in mind that this is a system that i just dont
reconfigure at whim. It's a proven, known system i use for testing and
nothing else. Suddenly it stopped working somewhere between 2.5.20 and
2.5.30. No lilo upgrade, no nothing, 2 years old binaries:
  [mingo@a mingo]$ ls -l /sbin/lilo
  -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        59324 Aug 23  2000 /sbin/lilo
