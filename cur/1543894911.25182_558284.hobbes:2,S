Look at SLED and Beagle (taking the indexing logic out of the equation.)
It runs good enough that a major Linux vendor is willing to stake its
reputation on it :)

Ok, so we optimize it.  Putting speed issues aside right now as a "mere"
implementation details, I'm looking for logical reasons the AA model
will not work in this type of system.

Is that a bet?  :)

The Beagle index backend is known to slow things down at times, yes, but
is that the fault of the inotify watches, or the use of mono and a
big-ass database on the system at the same time?
In the original inotify development, the issue was not inotify at all,
unless you have some newer numbers in this regard?
And Crispin mentioned that you all already implemented this.  Do you
have the code around so that we can take a look at it?
