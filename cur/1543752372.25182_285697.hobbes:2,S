Per class, yes.  The SCSI transport classes evolved such that they
simply don't display attributes that are irrelevant to the underlying
device.  Also, not all devices are fully capable, so attributes that are
ro on one HBA are rw on another.  This means that we need the attributes
per class device rather than per class.

The idea is simply to be an attribute container for classes that can't
use the per-class one (because of the needs listed above).

Well ... I can, certainly, but that would be window dressing it a bit.
The ultimate end consumer will be SCSI (and other bus) HBA's, not all of
which are GPL available.  However, as long as the HBA APIs exported by
the transport class are non-GPL available, this should all work (and
certainly none of the attribute container APIs are used by HBAs).

Yes, this function actually allocates the container (which contains the
classdev) then calls fn on it (or just does a class_device_add if no
fn).  I'll update the doc.

There is now ... you didn't wait long enough ...
