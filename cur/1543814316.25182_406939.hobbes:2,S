Let me rephrase - kexec doesn't define calls for machine_shutdown and 
others that are in arch/i386/kernel/reboot.c.  So kexec requires BIOS 
reboot code to be compiled in, even though the usage of the two is 
mutually exclusive.

It should work just fine.  But it could expose bugs on either end.  I've 
been monitoring our kexec testing, and I'll be able to help you with any 
issues that we might find on the Linux side.  :)

I was afraid of that.  I can back that change out.  The problem I had 
was that the shutdown code I was running in userspace would not make the 
syscalls to actually call machine_power_off, but machine_halt instead.  
Will fix.
