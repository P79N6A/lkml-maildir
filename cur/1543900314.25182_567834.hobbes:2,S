	Rather than requiring the caller set this, shouldn't we just
allow it?  Especially given there is only one non-page user?
  	while (page_nr < spd_pages)
 -		page_cache_release(spd->pages[page_nr++]);
 +		if (spd->spd_release)
 +			spd->spd_release(spd, page_nr++);
 +		else
 +			page_cache_release(spd->pages[page_nr++]);
