Is there in kernel something similar with VT_LOCKSWITCH to disable sysrq?
I was playing with vlock (to make my kbdleds blink:) and if i run vlock -a
and then do alt-sysrq-k and i loose that virtual console, but then i can
use the other virtual consoles.. 
why don't i remove sysrq?
I want to have magic sysrq in my kernel that i can use it if
something hangs, but i also want to lock up my vt's without logging out
when i leave my computer alone for sometime. This kind of situation in
coming when i goto assembly'99.
or some other way to lock your machine up when you leave it alone and
want to logout?
would there be some problems if someone would make patch to lock and
unlock sysrq? (someone 'coz i don't have the skills:)
if sysrq could be compiled as module, it would also solve this but
in think that it cannot be done so nicely like some switch to
disable/enable sysrq..
