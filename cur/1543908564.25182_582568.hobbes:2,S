foo.c has
#include "netlabel_domainhash.h"
Makefile has CFLAGS_foo.o += -I$(srctree)/net/netlabel
I prefer to use -I $(srctree)/net/netlabel for readability but '-I '
breaks on SuSE builds for some reason that I cannot be bothered working
out.  -I$(srctree)/net/netlabel works.

Not to mention that you might end up running with an insecure system.
Security must be failsafe.
