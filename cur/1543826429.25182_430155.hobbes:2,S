when you quote anything related to cpu performance on an x86 processor 
it's absolutely essential to indicate which cpu it is... basically 
vendor_id, cpu family, and model from /proc/cpuinfo.  (for example the 
entire p4 family has incredible model-to-model variation on things like 
shifts and extensions.)

i'd change the comment to:
/* define a few register aliases to simplify macro substitution */
because as you mention, it's totally impossible to write the macros 
otherwise.  (i've used the same trick myself a bunch of times.)
