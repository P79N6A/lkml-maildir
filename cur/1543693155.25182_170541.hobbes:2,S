You're forgetting that what the GPL says doesn't matter if it is
unenforceable.  Remember all the people yelling at me that they can
reverse engineer BK in spite of any no-reverse-engineering clauses?
That same logic applies to the GPL, you can't have it both ways.
It doesn't matter what you think, or I think, or Linus thinks.  What
matters is what is legal and what isn't.
