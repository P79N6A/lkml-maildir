This statement is obviously not true :-(
Let us start in a way that makes sense:
Please send me the whitepaper that was used to define the interfaces
and functionality of the /sys device
Please send me the other documentation (e.g. man pages) on the /sys
device
Please send me a statement on how long this interface will be maintained
inside Linux without breaking interfaces.
