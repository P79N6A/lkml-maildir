This is for whoever handles threading / process management or whoever
keeps track of header files.  No one is listed as a maintainer for those
areas in the MAINTAINERS file.
[dszd0g@gate ~]$ uname -r
2.3.34
It appears that the threading headers have been changed in the new
kernels.  However, /usr/include/linux/tasks.h is missing and should be
included for backwards compatibility.  Programs like procps require it.
It appears that /usr/include/linux/threads.h has superseded it.
/*
 * The default limit for the nr of threads is now in
 * /proc/sys/kernel/max-threads.
 */
In kernel/sysctl.c line 239:
        {KERN_MAX_THREADS, "threads-max", &max_threads, sizeof(int),
         0644, NULL, &proc_dointvec},
KERN_MAX_THREADS is an enum (39) declared in /include/linux/sysctl.h.
max_threads is declared and initialized in kernel/fork.c:
   max_threads = mempages / (THREAD_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE) / 2;
[dszd0g@gate ~]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/max-threads
cat: /proc/sys/kernel/max-threads: No such file or directory
[dszd0g@gate ~]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
8191
Documentation should reflect actual location.
For tasks.h maybe something like:
------------------------------------------------------------------
#ifndef _LINUX_TASKS_H
#define _LINUX_TASKS_H
/*
 * This file is for backwards compatibility and has been replaced
 * by threads.h
 *
 * NR_TASKS has been replaced by /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
 */
 
#include <linux/threads.h>
#define NR_TASKS        512     /* On x86 Max 4092, or 4090 w/APM
                                   configured. */
#define MAX_TASKS_PER_USER   (NR_TASKS / 2)
#define MIN_TASKS_LEFT_FOR_ROOT   MIN_THREADS_LEFT_FOR_ROOT
#endif /* _LINUX_TASKS_H */
------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks,
