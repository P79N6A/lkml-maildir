Yes, I was rather pleasantly surprised to see my BDI install boot to
X just fine with nothing more than plugging in the card and setting
the bios to AGP first.  But I haven't tried the FC3RC3 install to see
if it boots yet, its secondary to what this machine is intended to do.
Unforch, the mouse, which I also changed from a ps2 GE optical to a
USB optical logitek, is not being found by the xserver so it bails
out.
Thats a debian/morphix based release, does anyone know the inittab
setting for a non x boot with full facilities?, I'm confused, too many
years of redhat experience :(
