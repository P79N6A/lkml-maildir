This is a binutils/gas feature; gcc has nothing to do with it. I take it
the gcc 4.1 system is FC5 with binutils 2.16.91.0.6-5 and the gcc 3.4
system is something older?
The kernel build system is supposed to detect gas support
for .cfi_signal_frame -- and while the i386 test is obviously broken
(the i386 test for the directive doesn't actually use the directive),
the AMD64 test looks like it should work (assuming as-instr works).
