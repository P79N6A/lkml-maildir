Send patches against the latest Linus-tree unless the patches are
specifically for the -stable branch (where 2.6.20.y is -stable
and 2.6.21-rc6 or -git is Linus).  (Maybe it won't matter for
these patches....)
See Andrew's The Perfect Patch for more info:

We don't indent functions inside ifdef/else/endif blocks.
Just act as though the preprocessor lines are not there.
(That's our current common practice; I don't see that documented
anywhere.)
