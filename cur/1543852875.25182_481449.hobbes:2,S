I don't know.  In fact I forget how I worked out that it worsened in
2.6.early.
google(noapic) gets 232,000 hits.
I don't think it really matters when or why it happened.  If we take the
approach of fixing one machine at a time, we'll only need to fix a few
individual machines to improve the situation for a lot of people.
