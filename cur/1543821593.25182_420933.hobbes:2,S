James is the scsi-patch-accepting guy.  I do pick up lots of patches which
belong to subsystem maintainers (mainly because they're lossy...) but they
still go through the subsytem maintainer.

I don't appear to have a copy queued up, and I'm struggling a bit to
identify the right patch (partly because your email client appears to
support neither In-Reply-To: nor References:)
So.   Sorry, please resend.
