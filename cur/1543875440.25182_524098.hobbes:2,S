Subject: [PATCH] fs/buffer.c: Loop rewrite within grow_buffers for finding sizebits
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch alters the (do...while) construct to a simple (while) and saves 
one increment operation. It's entirely possible that gcc optimizes away 
the first iteration anyway, but in case it doesn't (and also because it's 
easier to read this way), I think this is better.
