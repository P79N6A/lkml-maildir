I do not see precisely the same - but I do not use devfs.
What happens for me is: the "mount -o loop /dev/loop0 /mnt"
takes the first unused loop device, /dev/loop0, and then
does "losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/loop0", and then does mount.
But there is a loop in the loop devices and the kernel dies in
infinite recursion.
The easiest fix is saying "don't do that then".
But, on the other hand, maybe it is reasonable to add a check.
Hope to send a patch later this evening.
