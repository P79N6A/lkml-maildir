No offence Christoph, but who are you again?
There is a clear reason why you among others do not want new architecture.
And that reason is (people) obsoletion.
Such political stance cannot go on forever -- just look at History.
Sooner or later things change and they change radically.  The question
is How prepared are you/we to cope with this (inevitable) change?
Either way, obsoletion or adoption -- think about it, it doesn't only apply
to computer and OS design, it applies to everything.
