Subject: IP option timestamp on SOCK_RAW.

Does someone have sample code, or can they explain in detail
(privately) how to set a specific timestamp value on an outgoing
IP packet on a socket opened with SOCK_RAW?
I've read the manpages for socket,setsockopt,ip, as well as
RFC791, headers /usr/include/netinet/i{n,p}.h, bits/in.h, and
various other headers.  I searched manpages with apropos, and I
viewed all online docs I could locate with gnu info on all
involved function calls.  I've looked through the source of
various SOCK_RAW programs like ping, etc.. and found nothing at
all to help.
I cracked down and decided to "use the source luke" so I cd's
into /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4 and read raw.c, followed the
function call through to ip_sockglue.c, ip_options.c, and here is
where I am totally lost with respect to following what is going
on.  I just want some sample userland code which allows me to set
an Internet timestamp in the IP options field in the header.  I
want to set this timestamp to a specific value.
Any help, source code, or pointers to either would be greatly
appreciated.
Thanks.
