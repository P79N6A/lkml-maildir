Chris, I had much the same reaction initially, and then I looked at the 
details, and either it fixes a real bug in a simple manner, or it is a 
comment change, etc.  It looks bigger than it is was what I finally 
concluded.  Perhaps there is some detail in which I am wrong, but since 
it was all tested together I didn't feel like picking out just a few 
lines of change to leave out (since that would actually increase the 
risk of introducing a bug).
