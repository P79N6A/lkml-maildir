It should work anyway, although you'll need to use cardmgr with vanilla
mainline kernels.

Maybe, maybe not.  Even with Dominik's great work, I suspect that PCMCIA
may suffer the same problem as USB in this respect, and require a delay
before trying to mount the root filesystem.  We'll have to see when folk
start using this.

That's an interesting one.  Alan Cox may have done some work on IDE to
resolve this, but there seems to be some issue preventing it (and Alan's
other IDE patches) being merged.

The CF adapter is a dumb piece of hardware which just converts the
socket pins from PCMCIA format to CF format.  It's completely
transparent to software.  In fact, software doesn't even know it's
there.
