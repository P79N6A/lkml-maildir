Minor nit, but I'd rather clear it up now.  Which distribution you run
doesn't matter for debugging.  What does matter is that we've got known
problems with a given compiler, and that compiler goes by a few different
flavors with the same version number.  Since there are known problems, if
you don't provide the compiler version, I'll ask.  If your bug is *really*
odd, I might ask a few different ways, just to make sure you give the same
answer every time ;-)
