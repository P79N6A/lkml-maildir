It was stable for me last time I tested. I do not think it needs
longer -mm testing than usual patches.

It looks like I'll do it, or Rafael can have it as an original
author. They are currently hosted at sf.net/projects/suspend. SuSE is
very likely to use them for 10.2 or so -- we want to provide nice
splashscreen so that users are not scared :-), we would like to do
encryption/compression too, etc.

It is probably relic from very early code, should not be needed, but
everyone is scared of removing it.
