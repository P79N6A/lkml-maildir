Ummm. You are missing key details please look at linux-mm. We will use 
huge tlb entries for the mmap and its optional.

Exactly. That is why 16M TLB entries speed up the kernel by 
4-5% using vmmemmap on ia64. Basically we end up with one TLB per node 
for the vmemmap which always stays in the cache. No additional lookups.
Without vmemmap we still need a 16M TLB for the 1-1 kernel mapping. This 
jsut cuts out the crud from sparsemem.
