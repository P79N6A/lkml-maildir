Something like this?
	#!/bin/sh
	. git-sh-setup-script || die "Not a git archive"
	rev=$(git-rev-parse --verify --revs-only "$@") || exit
	git-diff-tree -R -p $rev | git-apply --index &&
		echo "Revert $rev" | git commit
Just name it "git-revert-script" and it might do what you want to do.
It may not have the nicest error messages: if you try to revert a merge
(which won't have a diff), git-apply will say something like
	fatal: No changes
which isn't exactly being helpful. And the revert message could be made 
more interesting (like putting the first line of the description of what 
we reverted into the message instead of just the revision number).
