Agreed, which I realized as soon as the post was one minute old.  Sure, 
each helper for the device registers as a helper which puts a pointer 
in the task struct, which points to the accounting info so only one new 
field in task struct.  The more I ponder, the more doable it seems.

Don't forget that we do not actually have a usable notion of "block 
device stack" yet.  Perhaps you are just assuming that is 
easy/imminent?

Actually, the same pattern that Peter and I developed for handling 
network deadlock extends to this accounting concept.  As you say, it's 
a SMOP.
