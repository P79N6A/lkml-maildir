No. It can still be accurately profiled. You could profile theoretical
!preempt latency on a running preempt kernel.
*You* are ignoring my point :) *Nothing* has to be fixed if !preempt
users aren't seeing unacceptable latency. By definition, right?

So does CONFIG_SMP. For better or worse, it is in the kernel and
therefore a preempt bug is a bug and not a reason to turn preempt
off.

Jeff, the entire point of preempt is to not have to put cond_resched
everywhere. So yes, you can fix it by putting in lots of cond_rescheds,
or turning on preempt. What's more, with preempt, those that don't care
about 100us latency don't have to be executing cond_resched 10000 times
per second.
I'd actually say that the code needs fixing if the !PREEMPT case is doing
that much work to try to achieve insanely low latencies.
