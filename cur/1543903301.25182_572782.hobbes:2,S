I applied this, but I agree with checkpatch.pl:

if you need to use a variable in more than one .c file, put the extern
declaration in a common header that's included everywhere you use the
variable, including the .c file that it is defined in.  That way the
compiler can see if you get confused about the type of the variable.
When you get a chance, please post a follow-on patch to fix this.
