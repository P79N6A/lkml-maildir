Heh, if you want to exactly copy your existing kernel, just use the
'cp' command!  Saving the config is more useful for those of us who
want to build a new kernel with new source that is *similar* to some
existing kernel.  Also, when an interesting bug (ie panic) occurs,
we can extract the .config automagically and send it along with
the ksymoops decode to the maintainers.  It's always easier to reproduce
the bug if you have the .config to the kernel that produced it.
Remember, you do not have to enable the feature.
Enjoy,
Ben
