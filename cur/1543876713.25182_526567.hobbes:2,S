Current implementation (as you can see it in -mm or in my hid.git tree) is 
creating hidraw interface for just every HID device/interface. But this 
will get changed before merge.
Passing just everything to hidraw is not a good option, as this could lead 
to confusion and duplicating of input events (i.e. in-kernel hid driver 
processes the report and generates input_event(), and also userland driver 
obtains data from hidraw and generates input event through uinput ... not 
good).

BTW as soon as you have some presentable code, could you please send it so 
that we could see what aproach you have taken? Debating over code is 
usualy more efficient than just ranting random ideas :)
Thanks,
