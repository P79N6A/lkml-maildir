I wonder how this can actually work. For dereferencing current, it is not 
enough to include <asm/current.h>. The actual layout of struct task_struct
needs to be known to the compiler, which is given in <linux/sched.h>.
Maybe you were just lucky with your .config and every file using capable()
just by chance also included <linux/sched.h>?
(Chances are not bad since currently about every other .c file includes 
sched.h. However, I have patches pending to reduce this number to ~500..1000)
Uninlining capable() might indeed help us here.
