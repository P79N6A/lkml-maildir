Applied (after fixups), but I also moved the intermezzo header files into
intermezzo's own directory instead of leaving them in <linux/*.h>. I don't
see why anybody else should care about intermezzo-specific stuff.
Btw, the thing still doesn't actually compile, since there is no io_deamon
file checked in, even though the makefile says it wants one.
