Vatsa pointed out another scenario where cpusets+hotplug is currently
broken. attach_task in cpuset.c is called without holding the hotplug 
lock and it is possible to call set_cpus_allowed for a task with no 
online cpus. 
Given this I think the patch I sent first is the most appropriate
patch. In addition we also need to take hotplug lock in the cpusets
code whenever we are modifying cpus_allowed of a task. IOW make cpusets 
and hotplug operations completly exclusive to each other. The same 
applies to memory hotplug code once it gets in.
However on the downside this would mean 
1. A lot of nested locks (mostly in cpuset_common_file_write)
2. Taking of hotplug (cpu now and later memory) locks for operations
   that may just be updating a flag
