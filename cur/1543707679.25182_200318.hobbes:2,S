Why do this in user space?  The set_bit_one() and
set_bit_two_if_one_is_set() can't really be used for anything else,
really, so why not let check_or_create_name() do the above loop if
necessary to populate all of the dcache entries in the dentry cache?
That way we only expose one system call (check_or_create_name()), and
we let the internal dcache flags be an internal implementation detail.
It will also make it much easier to avoid races.
