cscope:
Minor stuff:
1) in cscope.files - I'd be replacing cscope.files with $@ within the rule -
you don't need a yellow belt to know $@ within a Makefile
2) /bin/rm vs rm
tags: Not going deep into it, I possibly should say here that hardwiring
depth 5 is not the best thing probably - once someone extends down to 6,
this place in the Makefile will for sure not be updated. You can make a loop
here to max depth, which you can discover right here, rather than the
current manually unrolled loop.
In general, I am not a tags user in the kernel (sticking to local tags +
global cscope), so I'd be happy if you and 
Pete could merge together your tags stuff. As for the ignore list, I don't
see much of maintenance work there - and, if you guys think there is, maybe
it is just possible to add Pete on the Kernel Build maintainers WRT to that
file?
Overall, IMHO, after you give it the last touch (maybe just dismissing my
present letter :-) ) the cscope stuff is mature enough for going to KO & Co.
(i.e. the kernel build guys); I don't consider myself a hardcore tags user
to say so about the tags portion. 
Keith, what do you think?
