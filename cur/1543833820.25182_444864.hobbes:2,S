Hi,
   Please Help me as i am newbie to 2.6 kernel.
   I have My driver code for 2.4.20 kernel(Here i generate .o with 100's 
of .objs linked together).
   I have a main GNUMakefile linked with 10's of individual make files 
w.r.t different directories
   i am able to compile my source code and able to link all individual 
modules and generate final module.o (2.6). but i am not sure how to 
genrate .ko from the module.o i have.
   I understand the compilation for 2.6 is different.
   How i can generate .ko which is required for 2.6.
  1) Is a simple Makefile changes for 2.4 to 2.6 enough..?? then what needs 
to done in my GNUmakefile(not the kernel source)
  2) Is it required to use kernel source  GNUMakefile as given in examples 
***
  3) Is it o.k to compile individual 'c' files with .obj and linked to 
module.o
  Please help me in this regards
THanx in advance
Subbu
