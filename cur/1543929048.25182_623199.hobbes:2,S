The PnPBIOS bits should still be fine at least I guess. And, it would seem 
this is rather essential to Thomas' efforts of making this stuff dynamic in 
the first place anyway. In these threads, Alan Cox (added to CC) earlier 
commented that with required locking when things are quite _that_ dynamic a 
different setup than the one currently on the table seems in order.
I don't know, but small steps may make sense giving that it seems dynamic 
allocation is fairly wanted with the massive number of PnPACPI resources 
people are reporting since the warning about overrunning them was added.
Rene.
