Here is the output of lspci:

I enabled the nmi watchdog by appending nmi_watchdog=1 to my kernel
boot parameters. I verified that it was enabled by doing a `cat
/proc/interrupts`. The NMI value was 30.
Still, there are no special messages in /var/log/messages or in any
XFree86 log nor in any boot log.. 
May be the nmi watchdog is not working because it is not a normal
'freeze' per se. What happens is that my mouse still moves around the
screen, I can also type (*only* type) commands into an xterm. But
those commands cannot be executed. When I try to execute a command,
nothing happens, I do not even get the prompt back. If I try to login
to a virtual console, I can type my login name, but then the password
prompt does not come up. When I try to switch back to X, I cannot do
so and I get stuck at that blank screen. Then I am force to do a cold
reboot.
Sometime during the subsequent boot process, I get that error
message while trying to load a random startup program. Last time, it
was while trying to load xfs.
Also, I have found that there is no pattern to the sequence of
operations that lead up to these freezes. I mentioned that if I
executed some programs on a virtual console before starting X, then X
would load fine, otherwise it would not. This is not true all the
time.
