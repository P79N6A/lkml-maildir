PPC has byte-swapped load and store instructions, and the
in*/out*/read*/write* family of macros use them.  It doesn't have the
endianness selectable on a per-page basis like the ultra does, where
you can do a normal load/store to a little-endian page and the
hardware byte-swaps it for you (if I've understood it correctly).
So if you have a frame buffer with multi-byte pixels, you can either
use a big-endian aperture if there is one, or have versions of all
your framebuffer access routines which use the byte-swapped loads and
stores instead of normal loads and stores.  That would be possible
(and would even be just as fast) but it would be a little ugly.
Paul.
