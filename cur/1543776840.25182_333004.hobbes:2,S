I'm having trouble merging my local branch to the latest tree from linus.
I event tried to grab a fresh tree from kernel.org and then create a clone 
from it.
I did a 
cg-init 
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
This worked with output being

New branch: 5c23804a0941a111752fdacefe0bea2db1b4d93f
Cloned (origin 
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git 
available as branch "origin")
Next I did the below.
mkdir fbdev-2.6
cd fbdev-2.6
cg-init /usr/src/linus-2.6/
defaulting to local storage area
`/usr/src/linus-2.6//.git/refs/heads/master' -> `.git/refs/heads/origin'

What is wrong?
