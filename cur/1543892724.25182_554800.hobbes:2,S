Not very good, this will break some apps.

This is better :)

Well, I assume you would like fd = open("/path/somefile", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | 
O_UNLINK, 0644)
(ie allocate a file handle but no name ?)
Quite difficult to implement this atomically with current vfs, maybe a new 
syscall would be better. (Linus will kill me for that :) )
(We dont need to insert "somefile" in one directory, then unlink it, we only 
need to allocate an unnamed inode to get some backing store)
This is a generalization of anonymous inodes ( fs/anon_inodes.c  )
