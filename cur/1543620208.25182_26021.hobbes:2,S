  Can't.  COMPAQ is one of those companies which have covered their
incoming email systems with firewalls rejecting connections with IP-
header option bits that were "reserved, set to zero when sending" for
first about 20 years, but which now got other specification.
(The firewall makers made an error and tought it to mean: "reserved,
 must forever be zero".)
See:   
http://vger.kernel.org/
   for pointers to info.
You can initiate a connection towards vger, but vger can't initiate
a connection towards you!
I repeat:  At present you CAN NOT receive email from vger.kernel.org.
