I did the same observation a few weeks ago on 2.5.74/gcc-2.95.3. I tried
to track down the responsible, to the point that I completely disabled every
driver, networking option and file-system, just to see, and got about a 550 kB
vmlinux compiled with -Os. 550 kB for nothing :-(
I don't have the config nor the exact numbers right here now, but I can
redo the tests on 2.6.0-test1 if needed.
I was interested in using a very minimal pre-boot kernel with kexec which would
automatically select a valid image among several ones. But 500 kB overhead for
a boot loader quickly refrained me...
Cheers,
Willy
