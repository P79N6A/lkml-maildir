No, in opposite, we have not changed it yet. The old calls were not
removed from VFS and will be kept there for few releases. So we still
use them - this helps to use the same UBIFS sources for older kernels.
But later we'll switch to newer calls which are in fact much better for
UBIFS then the old ones.
But yes, you of course can use UBIFS.
