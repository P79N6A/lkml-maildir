So what are these unusual conditions? Why would I not need to recompile?
If the interface changes then glibc will need recompiling and as
far as I can see, the kernel interfaces change relatively often,
particularly in the development tree. Moreover, how does one tell
which kernel the C library was built against anyway?
Thanks,
Richard
