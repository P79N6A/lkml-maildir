I'm afraid not, Ivo. The test I ran last night was against 2.6.25.-rc2-git4 and
that already has this patch applied. Furthermore, I have another card that uses
the rtl8180 driver and that works reliably. I, therefore, suspect that my problem
lies within the rt61pci driver or the rt2x00 infrastructure.
