yes, and if we want this to be a good API then we'd use something like
a bitmask to indicate what fields to update so we can update them in
groups in a raceless fashion, but that would require that the kernel
understand the internals of these structures. I didn't have that
luxury, so I grouped them in the way that best matched the common use
of the attributes.

can you tell me who you imagining will be using these attributes apart
from Samba, Wine and backup/restore apps?

It's little-endian NDR. For a full description of NDR in all its gory
details see 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9629399/chap14.htm
NDR seems like overkill at first, until you start to look at security
descriptors. They are very complex beasts, and using IDL/NDR makes it
much easier (in fact, security descriptors need some minor
enhancements to NDR to encode them the same way windows does).
