Is that really the only way?
I have a similar related problem.
My Matrox G200 uses int 10h, (or was it 14h, I forget) to provide
some useful information about things like refresh rates, amount of
video ram, clock speeds etc. I'd like to be able to extract this
(and other info) from it to add to my Gfxinfo program.
Setting up virtual machines sounds quite hairy..

Dave.
