 It's true that it's being used in more places than Andrew initially thought,
but a quick scan for jiffies_to_timeval() and jiffies_to_timespec() indicates
that it's not being used in any place where performance matters too much.
 I still consider do_div() a big kludge to workaround extremely poor code
generated by GCC. If we allow this, I see no reason for not allowing a very
similar kludge which provides even better performance.
 I agree with Andrew that we've run out of time for breaking things again,
so I won't be suggesting to implement a whole new set of 64bit operations
and use them all over the kernel. However, the div_long_long_rem() function
has been _already_ in use on i386 for some time, therefore the safest fix
we can do at this point is adding generic support for all other archs.

The div_long_long_rem() interface is even somewhat cleaner than do_div() and
can be implemented easily on architectures providing a 64/32 -> 32q/32r operation
(most 32bit processors do have it).

 I would be glad to do it once the discussion has settled, whatever
the final decision will be. Just don't make me do it twice, please ;-)
