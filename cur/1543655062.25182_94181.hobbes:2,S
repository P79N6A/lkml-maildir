Ok, finally starting to look at merging this, however:
This must go (we already have a timespec, there's no way it should be
here in <asm/signal.h>):
	+#ifndef _STRUCT_TIMESPEC
	+#define _STRUCT_TIMESPEC
	+struct timespec {
	+       time_t  tv_sec;         /* seconds */
	+       long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
	+};
	+#endif /* _STRUCT_TIMESPEC */
and you have things like
	+       if ((flags & TIMER_ABSTIME) &&
	+           (clock->clock_get != do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime)) {
	+       }else{
	+       }
and
	+if (!p) {
	+printk("in sub_remove for id=%d called with null pointer.\n", id);
	+return(0);
	+}
and obviously the "nanosleep()" thing and the CLOCK_NANOSLEEP_ENTRY()
stuff has been discussed in the unrelated thread (ie it doesn't work for
alpha or other architectures).
