Yes, check psmouse_probe. As soon as PSMOUSE_CMD_RESET_DIS acknowledged mouse
should cease sending motion data. That still leaves possibility of screwing up
detection if you are moving mouse while psmouse doing PSMOUSE_CMD_GETID.
But I don't think we can do much about it as we'd like to know that the device
is some kind of a mouse before we start messing with it.

I see.. but this particular case can be resolved but rearranging the code to
write command response first and then decrementing the counter... and putting
a barrier? Or just make cmdcnt atomic... spin_lock_irq feels heavier than
absolutely necessary.
