I had very similar experiences with the same CPU: VIA Ezra Stepping 8
(see: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=104262312700003&r=1&w=2).  And
that was not with an EPIA, but an ASUS CUV4X-C MB.
I had the processor replaced, because I narrowed the problem down to
that, but it didn't help.  
My feeling is ever stronger as I see these posts, that it is really
this modell that is buggy.  If that is true, then VIA should either
replace these CPUs with a non-buggy one, or find a workaround for
whatever operating systems are affected.
BTW, I could reliably cure this broblem by turning off the L2 cache in
BIOS.  Maybe it is some memory interaction problem, but I'm not an
expert on this subject.
