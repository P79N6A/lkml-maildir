Yes, I think so, this would also need fixing.

Whould it be problematic to change do_notify_parent_cldstop() so that it 
doesn't acquire siglock, but asumes that is is called with siglock held 
instead? I can't immediately see any reason why this shouldn't be 
possible.

So it basically does the same thing my patch did -- postpones signalling 
the parent until it is safe, right?
