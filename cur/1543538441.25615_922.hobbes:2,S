My problem (horisontal bands of garbage vhen scrolling in a VT with
matroxfb and XFree86-4.x.x) disappeared after I upgraded the XFree86
RPMS from XFree86-*-4.0.1-1mdk to XFree86-*-4.0.1-2mdk (from
Mandrake-devel). I changed back to XFree86-*-4.0.1-1mdk again, and the
corruption came back, so it was probably not a kernel problem at all.
