Wrong, if an app doesn't work with aoss it's a bug and we need to hear
about it.  I mentioned this previously in the thread and apparently no
one cares about it enough to file a useful bug report (we got one report
that the *kernel level* emulation didn't work which is a different
issue).
By far the most common bug report is "Skype does not work with aoss".
We would LOVE to see a reproducible test case using an *open source* app
(kiax might be a good place to start).
