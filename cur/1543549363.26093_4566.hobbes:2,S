What a strange idea!
The kernel is the authority, not fdisk.
Your /proc/partitions is right, as you can probably verify
by doing dd if=/dev/hda23 of=/dev/null or so.
Looking at the kernel boot messages will tell you precisely what
these unexpected partitions are.
(Don't you have CONFIG_BSD_DISKLABEL enabled, and slices in this
BSD partition?)
