We won't be able to fix completely this for a while time, but the fact
that BLKFLSBUF has special semantics has always been a major wart.
Could we perhaps create a new ioctl, say RAMDISKDESTORY, and add a
deperecation printk for BLKFLSBUF when passed to the ramdisk?  I doubt
there are many tools that actually take advantage of this wierd aspect
of ramdisks, so hopefully it's something we could remove in a 18
months or so...
