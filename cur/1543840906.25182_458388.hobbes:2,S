This is an old issue that has been discussed too many times on the
internet ("i810_wait_ring": 542 results). It's simply broken OpenGL/3D
SMP locking in the i810 AGP or DRI/DRM (whatever) driver module
which thus fails catastrophically sometimes on SMT/SMP machines
after OpenGL got invoked.
The solution IIRC is to not load the kernel module named i810something,
but (if you need that functionality at all) the new, properly working
i865(?) instead.
Why I know all this? Don't ask, it's obvious... ;{
Or are you asking what to *really* do about this unfortunate
situation to make sure it can never happen again on any box?
