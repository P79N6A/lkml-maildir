Let me clarify again: I don't want fancy stuff inside the filesystem that
magically knows something about right-or-wrong. The only _very small_
enhancement I would like to see is: driver tells fs there is an error while
writing a certain block => fs tries writing the same data onto another block.
That's it, no magic, no RAID stuff. Very simple.

You are completely right, I don't want any more: nice management of an error a
low-level driver reports to the fs. Only I would like to see as an fs-answer to
this: ok, let's try another part of the media. Currently it just sinks like
titanic.
