No binaries or rpms, just a patch against modutils 2.3.13.  This patch
should fix the problems with the "build" symlink for users who have
path[xxx]=/lib/modules/`uname -r` in modules.conf.
The patch is being released in the hope that some people will test it
and give feedback in the next couple of days, before the final modutils
2.3.14 is released.  It drops ftw(), replacing it with a modutils
specific file tree walk, see utils/xftw.c for the gory details.
