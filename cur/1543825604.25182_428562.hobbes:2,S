That's exactly my point - though I expand a bit more further down.
i.e. set_page_dirty_lock is unlikely to get held up on a read IO, however
it has to call into lock_page, and lock_page has no idea that it cannot be
waiting for IO, and so it has to call sync_page just in case.

While I agree that avoiding the sync_page in this particular case is
likely to solve the problem, it seems rather fragile.  Sometimes you
need to call ->sync_page when waiting for a lock, sometimes you
don't.  Why the difference?  Because there really are two different
locks here masquerading as one.
Yes there would be extra atomic ops at reclaim and truncate.  Is that
a problem? I have no idea, but you sometimes need to break eggs to fix
an omelette.  I suspect the extra bit would be very lightly
contended.

hmmmm.... no idea, sorry.
I was trying to trace through set_page_dirty to see if it was safe to
call it under a spinlock (or a bit_spinlock in this case).  I must
have taken a wrong turn somewhere...

Yes, PG_readin or PG_io would be better names, but might be hard to
have a graceful transition to that sort of naming.
And the point is that once you separated that function from PG_locked,
lock_page would not need to wait for IO, and so would not need to call
sync_page, and so your problem would evaporate.
