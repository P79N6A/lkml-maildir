Hi
I think I've found a regression in the pata-via module. My cdrom drive isn't
detected I have compiled in and also tried as modules pata-via and the SCSI
CDROM device driver
I think the problem may be due to my cdrom not having a jumper setting
either master or slave (or even cable select for that matter) as I lost the
wee jumper.
Even if this is the case I'd still call this a regression as the old code
finds it no problem
My dmesg states:
pata_via 0000:00:0f.1: version 0.1.14
ata3: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x1F0 ctl 0x3F6 bmdma 0xA400 irq 14

Does anyone have any ideas on why this is the case?
Cheers for any help you can offer
