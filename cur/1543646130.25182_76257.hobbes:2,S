Subject: [BK PATCH] minor devfs cleanup for 2.5.40
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here's a changeset from Christoph Hellwig that removes some unneeded
code from the kernel core.  This was leftover from before devfs became
part of the main kernel tree, and was trying to do some naming fixups in
kernelspace.  If anyone still has machines using these names, their
startup scripts should be modified to use the "standard" devfs names.
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
