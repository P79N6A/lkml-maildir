Indeed.
Which is why I want all the USB drivers in one place.
The USB interfaces are more likely to change than the keyboard interfaces.
When somebody changes how the USB urb's interact, I'd rather have all of
that under one tree.
Think about it another way: what about a driver that implements a
touchscreen and a framebuffer device, all in one (imagine a graphics chip
with built-in touch-screen support)? Do you want to split it up, so that
the touchscreen part is in "input", and the framebuffer part is in video?
Imagine the nastyness when these "two" drivers have to synchronize over
shared resources? (This, btw, is how the PC keyboard + PS/2 mouse driver
worked. Nightmare with shared spinlocks etc).
No. You don't split it up according to function. You split it up according
to other issues first, and _then_ you may sub-split it according to
function.
