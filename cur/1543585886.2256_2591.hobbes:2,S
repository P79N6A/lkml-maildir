Be that as it may, Martin's comments about normalizing are nonsense.
Rik's killer (at least in 2.4.3-pre7) produces a badness value that's
a product of badness factors of various units.  It then uses these
products only for relative comparisons, choosing the process with
maximum badness product to kill.  No normalization is necessary, nor
would it have any effect.
The reason a 256 Meg process on a 1 Gig machine was being killed had
nothing to do with normalization---it was a bug where the OOM killer
was being called long before we were reduced to last resorts.
