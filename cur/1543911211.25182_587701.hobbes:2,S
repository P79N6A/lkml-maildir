Subject: [PATCH] PTR_ALIGN
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/23/105

The AdvanSys driver wants to align some pointers, and the ALIGN macro
doesn't work for pointers.  Rather than try to make it work, add a new
PTR_ALIGN macro which is typesafe.
