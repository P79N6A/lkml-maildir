So two questions: why isn't -f the default?  And is /sys/slab
guaranteed to be a stable and permanent interface if the SLAB
implementation ever gets ripped out?  If so, maybe this should go into
util-linux-ng?  I am aa bit concerned about the lack of atomicity of
/sys/slab, but this is a heck of a lot better of many kernel drivers
or subsystems which use /sys and the completely punt on any kind of
userspace utility, forcing users to type crazy things like 
  echo 5 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/iwl4965/*/power_level
