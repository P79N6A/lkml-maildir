What use is this patch ?
One of the main reasons for the mlock rlimit is so that
security conscious people can let normal users' gpg
mlock a few pages.
This patch isn't usable for that at all, since switching
the sysctl on would just open up the system to an easy
deadlock by any user.  Definately not something any
security conscious admin would want to enable ...
