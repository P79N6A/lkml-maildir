djprobes has been "on the way" for some time now. Why don't you at
least have the intellectual honesty to use the same rules you've
repeatedly used against ltt elsewhere in this thread -- i.e. what
it does today is what it is, and what it does today isn't worth
bragging about. But that would be too much to ask of you Ingo,
wouldn't it?
But, sarcasm aside, even if this mechanism existed it still wouldn't
resolve the need for static markup. It would just make djprobe a
likelier candidate for tools that cannot currently rely on kprobes.

Chalk one up for nice endorsement and another for arbitrary distinction.
