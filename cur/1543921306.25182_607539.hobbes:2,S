From the perspective of the ramdisk it expects the buffer cache to
simply be a user of the page cache, and thus the buffer cache
is horribly buggy.
From the perspective of the buffer cache it still the block device
cache in the kernel and it the way it works are the rules for how
caching should be done in the kernel, and it doesn't give any
mind to this new fangled page cache thingy.

There are certainly implementation issues in various filesystems
to overcome before remounting read-write after doing a fsck
on a read-only filesystem will work as it does today.  So my patch
is incomplete.
