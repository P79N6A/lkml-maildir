Did you see the breakage with the original compiler? It might be some 
config setup or something.
But yeah, if Debian/sid is just using random compiler snapshots of the 
day, I htink we can just bury this as "pointless".
Who the heck takes a compiler snapshot and runs with it? At least when 
your kernel breaks, it seldom breaks subtly (but I would expect that most 
distros would not pick random nightly kernel builds). When your compiler 
breaks, you have random problems in totally unexpected places, the last 
thing you want to have is a random nightly snapshot in a distro - even a 
development one.
Strange.
