I'm getting calls to end_buffer_io_bad caused by block_truncate_page.
The path that is causing it is a update page with no buffers, so
create_empty_buffers gets called. (w/ all the buffers io set to
end_buffer_io_bad). Since the page is uptodate, the buffer is set to be
update and the b_end_io is never change to end_buffer_io_sync. Then,
the buffer is marked dirty. When the end_io function is called, BUG (and
hard lockup of system).
Am I not supposed to be calling block_truncate_page on a uptodate page with
no buffers, or is it something that fell through the cracks?
