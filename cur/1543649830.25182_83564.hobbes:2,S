You're talking about one of the first 2.5 versions of the patch. It
changed a lot since then, thanks to your feedback, too.

I thought this problem is well understood! For some reasons independent of
my patch you have to boot your machines with the "notsc" option. This
leaves the cache_decay_ticks variable initialized to zero which my patch
doesn't like. I'm trying to deal with this inside the patch but there is
still a small window when the variable is zero. In my opinion this needs
to be fixed somewhere in arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c. Booting a machine
with cache_decay_ticks=0 is pure nonsense, as it switches off cache
affinity which you absolutely need! So even if "notsc" is a legal option,
it should be fixed such that it doesn't leave your machine without cache
affinity. That would anyway give you a falsified behavior of the O(1)
scheduler.
