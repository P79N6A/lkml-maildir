Multiple X users (via xdm login) is what I'm looking for.  X-terminal is
the canonical answer.  In the light of recent development in PXE support
which effectively eliminated third-party packages like Etherboot,
Netboot, Rom-a-matic, and LTSP,  I was wondering if it's possible to go
the next logical step and eliminate motherboard/case as well.
This would be ideal for home market, where you want multiple users (ie.
kids) but with only one PC.  Sell it as "Linux Mainframe"... :-)
