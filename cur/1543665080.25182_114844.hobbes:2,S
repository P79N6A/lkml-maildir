Did this work in 2.5.62? The qlogicisp driver does have any error
handlers. Any error will cause a device offline state. You
should see a message at boot like:
ERROR: This is not a safe way to run your SCSI host            
ERROR: The error handling must be added to this driver
This does not explain what is causing the error handler to start up or
do anything to help your problem.
We have been switching to the feral driver to handle the qlogic isp
card. This driver contains error handling routines. I believe the 2.5
versions of the driver is in the -mm tree. I also believe Andrew has it
as a separate patch. 
I did try running the qlogicisp driver and it appears to be loading for
me, but I do not have any non-disk devices on the system at the moment.
