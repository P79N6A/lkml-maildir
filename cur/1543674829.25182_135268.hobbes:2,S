The SCSI mid-layer has quite flexible command submission and 
synchronization.  Since each SATA host controller I've seen so far 
differs in its queueing implementation and limits, this fits perfectly 
with the existing SCSI set up.
So, short-term, I save a ton of code over a SATA block driver. 
Long-term, the SCSI mid-layer benefits from the developer attention and 
becomes more lightweight as we push some generic concepts upwards into 
the block layer.  Just look at how far scsi mid-layer has come in 2.5, 
versus 2.4!  Much more lightweight even now.
So, short-term I disagree.  Long-term, I actually agree w/ you, in an 
indirect sorta way :)

This isn't an issue for me.  I have to do my own error handling, in 
fact.  I just define ->eh_strategy_handler, and do my own thing.  SCSI 
mid-layer nicely provides a kernel thread and command synchronization 
before and after it calls ->eh_strategy_handler.

I considered a native block driver, or perhaps a native block driver for 
SATA and SCSI pass-thru for SATAPI.
Actually getting down to coding, I see it as a huge amount of work for 
little gain.  You have to consider all the userspace interfaces, sysfs 
and device model support that wants coding, -after- you're done with the 
basic SATA block driver.  Userland proggies already exist for scsi.

Nope.  Not before or after.  (even without the patch, it should have 
worked in some amount of compat mode)
