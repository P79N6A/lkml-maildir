Sure, I know: I booted with a 3com Bluetooth Card in one of the two PCMCIA
slots I have.
Shouldn't PCMCIA slot 1 be ttyS0, PCMCIA slot 2 be ttyS1 and any of the
other serial ports ie ttyS2 and so forth? I have infrared as well (which
is setup in BIOS as well as RS232 on the back.l Where are these? Not
that I would need it... ;)
