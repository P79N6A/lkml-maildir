I feel like I've missed something in this discussion.
First of all I really don't understand the cause of the lost 128K in the 
first place, but it seems that by increasing the address space reserved 
for the kernel in user space by some amount fixes this problem.
My question is:  Why can't we just shrink the kernel address space by 
that same amount, allowing the kernel address space plus the extra to 
fit into 1GB?
