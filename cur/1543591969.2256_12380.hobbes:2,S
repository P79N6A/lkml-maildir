Hmmmm.. In principle this sounds good, but...
This doesn't seem to be in best interest.. Taking it to the extreme,
noone should code the linux kernel for buggy bios's, cards etc anymore
either..  We should all tell em to upgrade their hardware?
Almost every software application has made allowances for buggy or
non-compliance systems.  We should encourage their disuse, but should we
play god?
I still vote against anything that prevents someone from contributing to
the linux kernel, the movement, and since these mailing lists are the
'official' way of contributing, aren't we going to far?
Our way or the highway sentiment seems more in keeping with corporate
attitudes than with the 'open' attitudes that the open source movement
fosters.
Just My Humble Opinion...
