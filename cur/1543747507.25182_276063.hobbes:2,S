Hi All,
I recently learnt that limiting RAM with by using only "mem=xxxM" is
no good on machines equipped with PCI. In my case (vanilla 2.6.9) the
cardbus bridge on my laptop got mapped to the unused RAM area which
resulted in wierd errors due to the collision.
The right solution is to use "mem=" together with "memmap=" to mark
the unused RAM area reserved.
From now on I force the kernel to use 2016MiB by passing "mem=2016M
memmap=32M#2016M" instead of just "mem=2016M".
Anyway, this patch tried to document the behaviour. Please comment or apply.
Thanks!
