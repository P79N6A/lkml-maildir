Xgl doesn't run standalone, it needs either Xegl or Xglx. Xglx isn't
really interesting since you're running an X server inside of another
one. It's a good environment for software developers but I don't think
you would want to base a desktop distribution on it.
The leaves Xegl. If Xegl were to enter widespread use by the end of
2006 it would be the right solution. But I don't think it is going to
make it anywhere close to the end of 2006 since X11R7 and EXA are
going to be released in front of it. I suspect those two releases will
just be getting widespread by the end of 2006.
So we are looking at 2007. That means two more year's advances in
hardware and things like a NV 6800GT will be $40. In that timeframe
programmable hardware will be mainstream. We also have time to fix
some of the problem in the current server. As described at the end of
the paper a new server design would feature OpenGL as it's primary
API, xlib would still be supported but at a secondary status.

I think the EXA people will say they have the first server in
distribution that fully accelerates X Render.

I can't see any scenario where Linux can put together a full GPU based
desktop before MS/Apple. We aren't even going to be close, we are at
least a year behind. Even if we fix the server all of the desktop
components need time to adjust too.

It will be interesting to read other X developer's comments on
exposing programmable graphics via render.
