I'd agree about the unhashing, but as you have to re-hash it anyway if the
emptiness check fails, I'd argue for just doing something like
	unhash()
	empty = check_empty()
	rehash()
	if (empty)
		d_move()
and then we can leave d_move() with the very simple semantics it has (and
that make tons of sense for files etc).
I've put a pre-8 in "testing" on ftp.kernel.org if you'd care to look: it
does "lock_parent()" differently, and while I applied your vfat-specific
parts I didn't apply the other parts because they should be a non-issue
with pre-8 anyway (but you should verify your use of "d_move()", ok?)
