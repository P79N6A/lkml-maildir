To Richard Gooch, aka Mr. Junkmail Police of L-K:
	Shame on you on sending the below message,
	_ESPECIALLY_ on Christmas Eve.
	I do sincerely sympathize with your junkmail
	plight, but what you have done was undeniably
	improper, to say the least.
	Whether or not you subscribe to the Spirit of
	Christmas, whether or not you are a Christian,
	and no matter how highly you think of yourself,
	what you did was nothing short of infringing
	on others' right to post messages to the
	linux-kernel maillist.
	Please remember, the L-K list does belong to
	_ALL_ participants. I beseech you to stop
	insulting others who posted to the list.
	Thank you, and I wish you'll behave better from
	now on. Saint Nick may even decides to give you
	a nicer present 364 days from now, instead of
	that lump of coal you've gotten last night.
	Merry Christmas to all !!
	Most Sincerely,
	Pete

		THIS IS AN AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED REPLY
		   Your mail to me has been discarded
Hi! You have reached the mail filter of one Richard Gooch. I'm sorry
to have to do this to you, but I am now filtering my email to combat
the flood of junk email (spam) that I receive. I'm fed up with having
to waste my time sifting through junk email. This filter also protects
me from certain types of mailbombing attacks.
I received an email from you which appears to have come from a mailing
list I'm subscribed to, but does not appear to have been sent to the
list. This may be because you have set up your own mailing list which
includes the one I'm on, or perhaps you've Bcc'ed to the list I'm on.
Unfortunately, an increasing quantity of spam is being sent via
mailing lists I'm subscribed to (typically with unlisted or bogus
recipients). The filtering I've set up seems to be the only effective
way of discarding these spams. Other people on the lists use the same
filtering technique, although they silently discard these messages. I
generate an auto-reply so that you know what's happening.
NOTE TO BULK EMAIL ADVERTISERS, SPAMMERS AND OTHER PARASITES: if you
manage to break through my filtering, rest assured that I will ignore
your message on principle. Future mails will be automatically deleted.
Unsolicited commercial email is unwelcome and costs *me* time to deal
with.
The message you apparently sent to me follows:
