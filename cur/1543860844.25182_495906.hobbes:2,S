No, it won't need 2 transitions - just an extra function call,
so it won't hurt performance - it would improve performance.
ib_uverbs_req_notify_cq would call
	ib_uverbs_req_notify_cq()
	{
			ib_set_cq_udata(cq, udata)
			ib_req_notify_cq(cq, cmd.solicited_only ?
				IB_CQ_SOLICITED : IB_CQ_NEXT_COMP);
	}
This way kernel consumers don't incur any overhead,
and in userspace users extra function call is dwarfed
by system call overhead.

I don't see other examples. Where we did pass extra user data
is in non-data pass verbs such as create QP.
This is most inner tight loop in many ULPs, so we should be very careful
about adding code there - these things do add up.
See recent IRQ API update in kernel.

Donnu. I just reviewed the code.
It really should be up to patch submitter to check the performance
effect of his patch, if there might be any.
