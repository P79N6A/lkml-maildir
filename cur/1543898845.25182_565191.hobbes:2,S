1. The freezer cannot be guaranteed deadlock-free without constructing
   a dependency graph between tasks (both user and kernel), which is
   virtually impossible since the dependencies are not externally
   observable.
2. As a consequence of (1), we try to make a crude approximation of
   the graph by saying "only kernel threads that want to be frozen
   will be frozen" or some other similar statement.
3. However, (2) means that we can no longer guarantee that drivers
   will not get any I/O requests after their suspend method has been
   called, and therefore the freezer fails in its main objective.
4. We have an existence proof that reliable suspend can be achieved
   without the freezer.
To summarize, the argument is that the freezer is deadlock-prone and
ineffective.
Paul.
