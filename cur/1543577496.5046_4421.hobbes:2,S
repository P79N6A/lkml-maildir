The problem wasn't actually with lmsensors together with ACPI yet...  Just
enabling ACPI with this board causes the mouse to go insane.   i will however
recompile the stock 2.4.0 kernel that recently came out to test it again.  I'll
give you output from dmesg and /proc/interrupts before lmsensors is loaded and
after (after a new recompile of the drivers too).   I can tell you know though,
the acpi bus? is running on int 5 according to the bios.  ... Should have the
output ready within the hour.
