Given that the versioning was supposedly <major>.<minor>.<patchlevel> and
the difference between 2.4 and 2.6 was substantial, why not just bump
<major> instead of the minor.  Then we'd have 3.0, 3.1, 4.0, 4.1.1 (for
stupid mistakes).  Isn't it time we move off the 2.x series and start
thinking of the 3.x series?
