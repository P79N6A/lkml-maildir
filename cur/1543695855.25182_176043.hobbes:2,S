I have a pretty simple little raid 1 
/dev/hda1 and /dev/hdc1 should be mirrors of each other.
i created the raid like this
mdadm --create --level 1 -n 2 /dev/md0 /dev/hdc1 missing
(this is from memory - just to give you an idea of how this happened)
i also created /dev/md1 for swap
mdadm --create --level 1 -n 2 /dev/md1 /dev/hdc2 /dev/hda2
now when i go to add /dev/hda1 to the array all looks fine
mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/hda1
mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/hda1
array syncs up but i see this wierdness (it exists across reboots)
from mdadm --details /dev/md0
Number 	Major 	Minor 	RaidDevice	State
0	22	1	0		active sync /dev/hdc1
1	0	0	-1		removed
2	3	1	1		spare /dev/hda1
rebooting to a 2.4 series kernel appears to fix this problem...
In my search for information I read this post
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&threadm=rvg0.5x4.17
%40gated-at.bofh.it&rnum=4&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dmdadm%2Bfaulty%2Bremoved%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26selm%3Drvg0.5x4.17%2540gated-at.bofh.it%26rnum%3D4
which talks about patching md.c to fix a similar problem...
In test9 the patch discussed is already applied 
so it either doesn't fix the problem or this problem is not the same
problem 
best wishes
