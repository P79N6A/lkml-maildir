AFS' death is not too likely.  But there is a freely available clone...

There are of course a couple thousand types of hardware out there
which no doubt do nothing for you personally.  Yet support continues
to be added for them because others find them useful.  Similarly,
while you personally don't use AFS, a big pile o' folks use it, need
it, because it has been entrenched in environments for many years.
arla solves this problem quite nicely.  It has matured quite rapidly
in the last year or so.  We've come to depend on it by now.
