Hi,

yes. actually the mini kernel dump has an interface from the
operational kernel to the mini kernel that contains "what pfn
should be dumped". 
It takes 2-3 minutes to dump 8GB memory (our typical customer).
So it is relative low priority to support selecting dump pages,
but I remind it.

Maybe we should develop another fault isolation method on such
system.

It is an important point to provide the fault analysis service.
We are considering that point. It is rather an operational problem 
than technical problem. We are planning some cryptographic mechanism.
Thank you.
