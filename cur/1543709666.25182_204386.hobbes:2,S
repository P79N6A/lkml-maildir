Of course.  What I'm saying is that in 2.6.0-test{8,9} it was rare to
trigger the problem (only with BTC keyboard) and the change above made
it trivial to trigger the keyboard.  Basically, your fix in
cset 1.1619.1.17 made it more common for stuff to be unlinked in
the "deferred" (proper) manner and that made it much more likely to
trigger the bug.

It's not an issue of DMA coherency, it's an issue of DMA vs. interrupt
ordering.  I believe the WHD interrupt is arriving at the CPU before
the DMA update to the HCCA is done.  In my second patch, the readl()
at the beginning of the interrupt ensures that the DMA update to
the HCCA is completed before the readl() returns data.

Eh, it's read like this:
   #define OHCI_FRAME_NO(hccap) ((u16)le32_to_cpup(&(hccap)->frame_no))
   finish_unlinks (ohci, OHCI_FRAME_NO(ohci->hcca), ptregs);
The HCCA is in host memory.

You must have not received my follow-up message.  There was a typo in
my message: it was supposed to say "write-only" area.

I'm 99% certain that the problem I saw back in October (BTC keyboard)
was identical to the one triggered by cset 1.1619.1.17.
