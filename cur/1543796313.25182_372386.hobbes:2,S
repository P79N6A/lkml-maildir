Yes. This is what I also did earlier to test. But unfortunately,
we need more than this.
Having by "pid" basis is not good enough. I need per file/mapping
basis collected and sent to user-space on-demand. Is systemtap
hooked to relayfs to send data across to user-land ? printf() is
not an option. And also, I need to have this probe, installed
from the boot time and collecting all the information - so I can
access it when I need it - which means this bloats kernel memory.
Isn't it ? 
Thanks,
Badari
