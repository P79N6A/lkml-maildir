Ahem.
The point you are making is rather moot. Because if you manage to get a
shell on the system, the data can readily be copied because the encrypted
filesystem is supposed to be mounted.
Unless I miss your point.
And once you are in the system there are easier ways to obtain the
passphrase than the one you described above. As I clearly stated earlier,
it is merely more difficult to obtain the encrypted data. It is _not_
impossible. It took me approximately 4 hours to break into the system
myself. I bet there's people around who can do it in less than 1 hour.
Some of you might then ask: "What's the point of it then anyway?"
Well, I am probably capable of creating a much better solution with almost
unbreakable encryption. My boss just won't allow me the time for this.
This patch took me about a day to write. It's the best I could come up
with in such a short time.
