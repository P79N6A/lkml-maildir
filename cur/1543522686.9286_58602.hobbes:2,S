Hello..
Iam using redhat 6.1 kernel and trying to build a custom SMP kernel. I have
some changes to the base kenrel 
for some modules that i need to suport my driver. 
when i build using 
make bzImage after a make clean. i dont see the version symbols from 
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/modules/*.ver getting re-generated. Anyone
could drop me a note on how to get this
regeneratated? If i use no symbols and versioning all works fine.  i done
see a rule that would run the /sbin/genksyms to regenerate the symbol files.
any ideas would be helpful
