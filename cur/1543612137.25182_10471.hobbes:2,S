At the last time I've tried, the bad latency happened only on OSS
emulation.  There must be some small difference of behavior between
OSS and emulation.  Yes, this is "must fix", too.
On ALSA native mode you get even lower latency than OSS.
IIRC the chip reported on lkml is ymfpci - it cannot achieve latency
lower than 256/48000 =  5.33 msec, anyway, due to h/w limit..
