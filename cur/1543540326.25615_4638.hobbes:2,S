It is, and you are right.  But that is not the goal.  He wants to spin them
down and then *keep them spun down.*  Thus, an hour a day of driving is
better than driving all day or start/drive/stop all day.
This was his original problem, sync was causing his drives to spin back up,
when he wanted them to stay down.
