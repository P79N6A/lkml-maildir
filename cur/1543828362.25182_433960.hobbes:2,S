Providing the information about what devices a virtual driver will
register when loaded seems like a good idea.
Something like the following occurs to me. But it doesn't deal with
loop's ability to register a different number of minors based on a
module parameter. Not really sure what to do about that.
Going in this direction is also a further impediment to dynamicly
assigned device numbers.
