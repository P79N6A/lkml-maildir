You may want to upgrade to 2.2.17, or newer...

It is better to ask in news://news.vmware.com, in 
vmware.for-linux.{experimental,misc}. But I recommend you to buy more
memory, or downgrade window manager. If you have only 128MB of RAM, and
you are running Gnome with XF4.0, and VMware with 80MB virtual NT,
you can stress system beyond limits...
