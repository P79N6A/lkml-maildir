Turning off the L2 cache just means you made everything run slower, and
changed the timing so the bug doesn't happen.  There could be geometry
problems with your drive and the versions of Linux/Windows you are
using.  You may want to try upgrading to the latest and greatest stuff,
and see if you problems persist.  There were problems in the recent past
with very large drives that got fixed, though I have not heard of 10GB
drives giving folks fits for a while.
