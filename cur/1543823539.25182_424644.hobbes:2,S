You may wish to look at the microstate accounting patches at
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cvs/kernel/microstate/
I made the clock source configurable.
It's acually rather difficult to find a reliable cross-platform
monotonic clock with good resolution.  And different statistics may
want different clocks; for my purposes a cycle counter is best
(because I'm running on a machine that varies the clock speed for
power management reasons), other people may want nanoseconds.
