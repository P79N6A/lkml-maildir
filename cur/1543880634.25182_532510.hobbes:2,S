See

I'm giving the first 5 patches of that series (i.e.
linux-2.6.21-001-cleanup_unstable_write.dif to
linux-2.6.21-005-fix_nfsv4_resend.dif) an extra beating since those are
the ones that I feel should go into 2.6.21 final in order to fix the
read/write regressions that have been reported. They should be identical
to the patches that I posted on lkml in the past 3 days.
Please feel free to grab them and give them a test.
Cheers
  Trond
