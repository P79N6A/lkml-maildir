You're right. When i have a bit of time, i'll translate the page.
The version of the kernel is not so important.
The code is highly portable and little dependent of the internals of kernel.
It only needs some functions that continue to survive in newer versions of
Linux.
I used 2.2.4 only because it was ready-to-use on my machine.
The main purpose of the article was not to present a professional
mechanism that you can download and use into your own applications.
It is only the proof of a fact: Linux IPC Mechanisms
are ***structurally*** inefficient.
Bye.
