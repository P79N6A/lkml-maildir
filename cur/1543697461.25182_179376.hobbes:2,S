Is the "plug and play" menu just ISA plug and play only?  (It has nothing to 
do with hotplug or anything else, right?  PCI devices are "plug and play", 
but that's an actual part of the PCI spec.  USB is hotplug and play, etc.)
Or is this also used for on-motherboard devices in modern systems?  (Is it 
ever likely to be needed on a laptop made in the last five years, for 
eample?)
