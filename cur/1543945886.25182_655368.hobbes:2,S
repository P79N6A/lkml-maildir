If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck.....
When Linus used "From" "Subject" and "Date" together in the context of
"mail", it sounded a lot like he was talking about the headers section
of a standard mail item.  I guess he wasn't.
I don't really care if "From:" gets called a 'tag' or what, but given
that it is an important piece of metadata associated with a patch, it
seems good to document it in the same place as other important pieces
of metadata that are associated with patches.
