Descriptor error means,  the driver told it to do something but the 
OWNER bit wasn't set.
Only ever saw this on the Gigabyte motherboard.
It looks like the chip reads the wrong memory sometimes. The problem 
happens only on the on-board NIC's
and only on this kind of motherboard.  For testing, I have put code in 
to check that the receive data actually
arrived before the IRQ, it triggered on my Gigabyte 925 motherboard. It 
appears that DMA access
is messed up. This board has lots of "overclocker" friendly stuff; maybe 
the BIOS never really sets up the PCI
bridges and clocks properly.
It doesn't seem like a software or driver problem. I have tried tweaking 
PCI registers but nothing worked
in this case.
