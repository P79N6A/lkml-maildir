    With this patch, initrds seem to get 'skipped'.  I think this is
probably the cause for the reports of problems with RAID too.
    Just after loading the initrd (RAMDISK: Loading 5284KiB [1 disk]
into ram disk...) the kernel tries to mount the real root fs -- if the
necessary drivers are built-in, it proceeds from there; if not, not.
    I'm guessing that when the initrd code calls mount_block_root() to
mount the ramdisk, this bit makes it decide to try to mount the real
root instead:
     if (!ROOT_DEV) {
	ROOT_DEV = name_to_dev_t(saved_root_name);
	create_dev(name, ROOT_DEV, root_device_name);
     }
    
    Perhaps this should not be done until after the first attempt to
mount fails?  Sorry, I haven't had nearly enough coffee today to
attempt to make a patch. :-)
