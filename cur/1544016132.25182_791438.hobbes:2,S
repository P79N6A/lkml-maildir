Hi,
following are two patches for the async infrastructure:
1) Try to handle failures when starting threads. (Failure to create the
manager thread is rather pathological, though.)
2) Add some kerneldoc to the exported functions. (I'm not sure whether
the term 'running list' is descriptive enough, but I can't think of
anything better...)
Patches are against current -git.
