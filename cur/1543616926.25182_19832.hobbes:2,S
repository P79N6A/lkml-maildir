Yes, this should work :
    if (likely(prev != next)) {
        rq->nr_switches++;
        rq->curr = next;
        next->cpu = prev->cpu;
        spin_unlock_irq(&rq->lock);
        context_switch(prev, next);
    } else
        spin_unlock_irq(&rq->lock);
and there's no need for barrier() and rq reload in this way.
