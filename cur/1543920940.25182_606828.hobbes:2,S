Hi Miller:
Thank you for your response.
The reason why MSIs of these northbridges do not work is still under
further debug, we are NOT able to tell its hardware issue or software
issue at this  time. But enablement of them will lead to the OS
installation failure in many distributions like openSUSE, Ubuntu etc:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=302016
So we have to disable them firstly before we find out the root cause,
maybe they are just workarounds.
If you guys know much more about this MSI problem, don't hesitate to
tell us, we can debug on some of the hardware platforms.
BTW, There already some disablements to some ATI NB MSIs in the kernel,
the reasons are similar.
Thanks
Shane
