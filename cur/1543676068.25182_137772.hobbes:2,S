Personally, I'd say that's pretty important ;-) But I get your point ...
On the other hand, you could look at it as "better local latency" rather
than "worse remote latency". Particularly if you stand on a big Sun
server when you look, where everything sucks equally for memory access 
latencies ;-)

The NUMA scheduling code isn't very bright about threads right now,
but we will fix that soon enough ;-)
