I'm still seeing the libata warning that disks were not spun down
properly on the following two setups and am wondering whether I need
a new shutdown binary or the changeset mentioned below is not meant
to fix what I'm triggering by halt'ing.
If it's not a bug I will try to update my shutdown utility and if
that does not work I promise not to bother lkml about a problem
caused by my userland. If it is a bug I hope it will be of interest
for 2.6.22 bug tracking.
Setup 1:
SATA 1 Disks
AMD64 3200+
nVidia nForce 3 250 (Ultra?)
Debian i386 Unstable
Setup 2:
SATA 2 disks
Core 2 Duo E6600
Intel 975X
Debian x86_64 Unstable
Just to be clear what warning I'm talking about:
DISK MIGHT NOT BE SPUN DOWN PROPERLY. UPDATE SHUTDOWN UTILITY

The following is from the reply I got from Michal Piotrowski while
I was trying to find out what happened to the regression report:

   libata: fix shutdown warning message printing
   Unlocking ap->lock and ssleeping don't work because SCSI commands can
   be issued from completion path without context.  Reimplement delayed
   completion by allowing translation functions to override
   qc->scsidone(), storing the original completion function to
   scmd->scsi_done() and overriding qc->scsidone() with a function which
   schedules delayed invocation of scmd->scsi_done().
   This isn't pretty at all but all the ugly parts are thankfully
   contained in the stop translation path where the compat feature is
   implemented.

If you think about this, please send a bug report. IMHO it's ABI breakage.
