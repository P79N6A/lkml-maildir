But you don't do a very good job. When you go above 64 vmaps cached, you
purge _all_ of them. fsblock's vmap cache can have a much higher number
(if you want), and purging will only unmap a smaller batch, decided by a
simple LRU.

It also could do a lot better at unmapping. Currently you're just calling
vunmap a lot of times in sequence. That still requires global IPIs and TLB
flushing every time.
This simple patch should easily be able to reduce that number by 2 or 3
orders of magnitude on 64-bit systems. Maybe more if you increase the
batch size.

vmap area manipulation scalability and search complexity could also be
improved quite easily, I suspect.

fsblock_memcpy(fsblock *src, int soff, fsblock *dst, int doff, int size); ?

I don't think you've looked very far with all this low hanging fruit.
The several ways I suggested combined might easily reduce xfs vmap
overhead by several orders of magnitude, all without changing much
code at all.
Can you provide a formula to reproduce these workloads where vmap
overhead in XFS is a problem? (huge IO capacity need not be an issue,
because I could try reproducing it on a 64-way on ramdisks for example).
