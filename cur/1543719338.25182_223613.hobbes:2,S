That sounds like a different problem.
The warning itself is harmless.
I see another patch (not from me) related to closing a tty device
(also in tty_io.c) that has gone into 2.6.7-rc1
that may be related. I include that patch below

In order to see the warning, the synctty line discipline must
be waiting to push more send data to the tty device when disconnecting.
If the line is idle, then the warning will not appear on hangup.
You can try and provoke the warning in the unpatched kernel
by causing a hangup while sending lots of data.
