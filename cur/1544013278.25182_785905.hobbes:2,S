I found some overlapping (or cloned) functions in
btrfs-unstable.git/fs/btrfs, for example:
 - Declarations to apply hardware crc32c in fs/btrfs/crc32c.h:
   The same code is found in arch/x86/crypto/crc32c-intel.c
 - btrfs_wait_on_page_writeback_range() and btrfs_fdatawrite_range():
   These are clones of wait_on_page_writeback_range() and
   __filemap_fdatawrite_range() respectively, and can be removed if they
   are just exported.
 - Copies of add_to_page_cache_lru() found in compression.c and extent_io.c
   (can be replaced if it's exported)
How about including patches to resolve these in the btrfs kernel tree
(or patchset to be posted) ?
In addition, there seem to be well-separated reusable routines such as
async-thread (enhanced workqueue) and extent_map.  Do you intend to
move these into lib/ or so?
I also tried scripts/checkpatch.pl against btrfs, and it has detected
45 ERRORs and 93 WARNINGs.  I think it's a good opportunity to clean
up these violations.
With regards,
