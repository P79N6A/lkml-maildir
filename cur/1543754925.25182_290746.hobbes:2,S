Eh?! there can only be *one* legacy I/O space.
We can support multipl IO port spaces, but only one can be the "legacy".
Moving the VGA device can only function within that legacy space
the way the code is written now (using hard coded addresses).
If it is intended to work with multiple IO Port address spaces,
then it needs to use the pci_dev->resource[] and mangle that appropriately.
