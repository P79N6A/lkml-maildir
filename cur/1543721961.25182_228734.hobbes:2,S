The problem is that (depending on platform) the pci_map_* and dma_map_*
functions ignore both masks. An example of such platform is i386 :-)
It seems the masks are used on i386 for only one thing - consistent
dma mask is used for consistent allocations only, and normal dma mask
is not used at all.
The normal mask is used mainly on 64-bit platforms and the meaningful
values are 2^32-1 and 2^64-1. It's used by PCI-X device drivers to
enable DAC transfers. This is why it isn't used on 32-bit platforms.
