Hello all,
I compiled 2.3.41 yesterday on a dual P6 machine with
256MB RAM. Now I keep getting that message in syslog.
It's always the same number. How could I trace what
is trying to make such large allocations within the
kernel ?
Please comment, I'm afraid of memory corruption, but
I've seen no sign of it yet. The machine (and the RAM)
is 1.5 years old and has worked flawlessly until 2.3.30.
The exact message from syslog is:
Jan 30 13:31:35 tony kernel: kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
Jan 30 13:32:04 tony last message repeated 10 times
Jan 30 13:33:05 tony last message repeated 144 times
Jan 30 13:34:05 tony last message repeated 200 times

Jan 30 13:36:05 tony last message repeated 189 times
Jan 30 13:37:05 tony last message repeated 230 times
The printk of that is in
/usr/src/linux/mm/slab.c:1682
thanks for your comments,
Patrick
PS: .config on request. I think it's not relevant.
    The machine does not use PAE (obviously).
