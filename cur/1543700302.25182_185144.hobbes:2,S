Just to followup, I've downloaded, compiled and installed 2.6.0 and
Len Brown's ACPI patch on my Dell Precision 610MT box and it's works
just fine.  I was never able to get 2.6.0-test11 with ACPI to work,
though I never put in Len's patch on there.  
The system is up and running now in SMP mode, so I think once 2.6.1
comes out with the ACPI updates, we should be all set.
I've got the following ACPI configuration options setup:
  CONFIG_ACPI=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_INTERPRETER=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_AC=m
  CONFIG_ACPI_BATTERY=m
  CONFIG_ACPI_BUTTON=m
  CONFIG_ACPI_FAN=m
  CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=m
  CONFIG_ACPI_THERMAL=m
  CONFIG_ACPI_ASUS=m
  CONFIG_ACPI_TOSHIBA=m
  CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_BUS=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_EC=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_POWER=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_PCI=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_SYSTEM=y
  CONFIG_ACPI_RELAXED_AML=y
  CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_ACPI=y
If I get a chance over Xmas, I'll see about changing the RELAXED_AML
stuff as well.  But looking at my interrupts, they certainly don't
seem too balanced:
    > cat /proc/interrupts 
	       CPU0       CPU1       
      0:   31862628         48    IO-APIC-edge  timer
      1:        504          1    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
      2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
      8:          4          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
     11:          0          1    IO-APIC-edge  Cyclom-Y
     12:      25139          0    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
     14:      14906          0    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
     15:      11947          0    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
     17:       6346          1   IO-APIC-level  eth0
     18:      46860          1   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx, aic7xxx
     19:        140          0   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
    NMI:          0          0 
    LOC:   31867092   31867091 
    ERR:          0
    MIS:          0
I've got the following APIC config settings:
  CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
  CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
  CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
So I think that 2.6.1 and higher will work out of the box for the
problematic Dell boxes, once the right ACPI patches get added.
