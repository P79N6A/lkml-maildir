Thanks I'll take a look, if all it takes is 3 RPC calls then it
doesn't sound too bad, to deal with.

Well that sounds like a reasonable approach.  It sounds like dropping
and re-adding initrd support in a slightly different form.
I guess from what you have described there could be a test ``if !cpio
archive assume old initrd''.  But I can't imagine how that would be
anything but ugly.

O.k. This sounds quite reasonable on the boot protocol
side.  Bootloaders if they want to take advantage of the new
functionality need to be made aware of the cpio issue but otherwise
can remain blissfully ignorant.
Except for the issue of creating a kernel file with one or more of
these cpio archives attached to the kernel image.  This work seems
completely independent from what I'm doing.  And for simple network
booting it is required to have everything all in one file. 
I have alarm bells ringing in my gut saying there are pieces of your
proposal that are on the edge of being overly complex... But without
source I can't really say.  Arbitrary NULL padding between images is
cool but why?
