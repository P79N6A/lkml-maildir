Shouldn't filp->private_data be cleared on lseek? It looks like lookup
cursor is never cleared once set and so readdir will always go forward
independently of ->f_pos updates. Note that glibc implementation of
readdir() (on the top of getdents64()) does call lseek on the
directory. So does seekdir(3).
