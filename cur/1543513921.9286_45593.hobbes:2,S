I can be 100% sure there is SOMETHING wrong with the memory allocation in
2.2.23 :(
I have a Abit BX6 Rev Motherboard, 256Meg Ram and trying to compile a new
kernel the full way thu it will suddenly run out of memory
whilst doing it. ( I have to compile 1/2 the kernel and then start again to
make it all the way thru)
Also it happens whilst running X.. Suddenly runs out of memory :(
I cannot show /proc/memory or anything as it just freezes.. (saying VM:
something arather)
I've NEVER had any problems with any other kernels in the past.
This is really anoying in 2.3.23 apart from various spelling mistakes in the
kernel source code and alot of undefined symbols to load
modules
