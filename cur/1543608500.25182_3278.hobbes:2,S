So you want generaiton and parsing of text strings whenever we pass an int from
the kernel ?

cat /proc/mdstat    - that's practical !
cat /proc/cpuinfo   - equally so
Anyway - I won't involve myself in the argument whether we should keep
the old /proc or not - I wanted to present my idea how we could overcome
some fundamental problems in the existing framework,  non-intrusively.

I don't care enough about it to discuss it now, but I'm sure others do  ;)

I see your point.
There's some system overhead when converting text/integer values, but
if you're polling so often I guess you have other problems anyway...

I like the idea of single-value files.
But then how do we get the nice summary information we have today ?
Hmm...   How about:
  /proc/meminfo    - as it was
  /proc/.meminfo/  - as you suggested
That way we keep /proc looking like it was, while offering the very nice
single-value file interface to apps that needs it.
I could even live with text encoding of the values - I just hate not being able
to tell if it's supposed to be i32/u32/i64/u64/float/double/...  from looking
at the variable.   Type-less interfaces with implicitly typed values are
*evil*.
I'd love to have type information passed along with the value.   Of course
you could add a "f"_t file for each "f", and handle eventual discrepancies
at run-time in your application.
