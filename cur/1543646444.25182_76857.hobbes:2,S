Subject: Disabling route-cache?
We have some linux routers and wish to disable the route cache. Is there
a way to do that? 
The route cache is using so much of the CPU that it is making routing
ineffective.  We are routing high
PPS > 100,000 and with the route cache enabled it will not even do half
of that.   We tested by creating
a single ip -> ip flow at 100,000 pps and the machine routed it just
fine, however when we create a 100,000 ip -> 100,000 ip test
the machine drops 80% of the packets due to creating and tearing down
massive entries in the route cache.
I wish for it to work like Cisco's CEF with only an adjacency cache  and
not a route cache for every flow. 
I don't know why it doesn't work this way in the first place.  Only the
ip_conntrack should keep track of flows (on a side note
if we enable ip_conntrack the whole machine goes to pot, there's no way
it's going to do it with that module loaded).
Please if anyone has any ideas.  Thanks
