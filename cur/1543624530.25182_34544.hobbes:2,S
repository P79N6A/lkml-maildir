Hello,
	just a quickie, our Dell Poweredge boxes - Serverworks motherboard - are 
continually pumping out IO-APIC errors as I've reported here before, we have 
three of the same boxes running FreeBSD (limitless file descriptors per 
process - sorry, we need it!) and I've just noticed that dmesg on these says 
that:
IO APIC - APIC_IO: Testing 8254 interrupt delivery
APIC_IO: Broken MP table detected: 8254 is not connected to IOAPIC #0 intpin 
2 
APIC_IO: routing 8254 via 8259 and IOAPIC #0 intpin 0 
Does this help anyone diagnose the error??
Best of luck,
Tim
