There is a worthwhile point here: if your input to the makefile
generator is buggy and make errors out, you'll have to look at the
generated code in order to relate the make error to the original.
(It's not that hard with automake, admittedly, but make should
really have a #line analogue to help. It could be much worse, as
anyone who ever tried to use Knuth's old WEAVE tool would know.
At least automake doesn't intentionally obfuscate the makefiles
it emits...)
