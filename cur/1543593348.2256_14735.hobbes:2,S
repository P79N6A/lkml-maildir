Same here. I've set up an Alpha Ruffian with a Quad Starfire as a new
firewall. My test clients were x86/2.2.16-18 up to now. TBench between
two clients directly: 10 MB/S. TBench through the 2.4.4/5 router: 0,4
MB/s.
Right now I am compiling 2.4.5 on the clients to verify that it's an
2.2 vs 2.4 issue.
