I would like to know what the diffs are between my version (attached)
and this version before they get applied.
The only reason my version has not been submitted is because it lives
in the drivers/misc directory, and mainline kernel folk don't like
drivers which clutter up that directory.  In fact, I had been told
that drivers/misc should remain completely empty - which makes this
set of miscellaneous drivers homeless.
