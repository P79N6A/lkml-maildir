Oh good :)
The only thing that could hurt is that the hash list traversal in
find_pid now does prefetch.
This would be trivial to remove by introducing another list.h entity
similar to __list_for_each for hlists, however I would have thought
that if anything, the prefetch might help a tiny bit on the odd
workloads where the number of tasks is much greater than the number
of hash entries. Ingo? WLI?
I expect you could get a good bit of overlap on the prefetch if the
next hash pointer isn't in the same cacheline as ->nr... although,
on a 64-bit architecture with a 32byte cacheline size, this is
guaranteed to be the case. Why not put them together?
