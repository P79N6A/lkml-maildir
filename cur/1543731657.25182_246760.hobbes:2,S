As you will each time you muck around with your files-are-directories.
Nothing new there.

So the _kernel_ has to know about thousands of formats, just in case it
some blue day it comes across a strange file? Better leave that to the
applications.
You will _not_ be able to define a single format for extra data about the
file, there will be differing extra data for different users (do you
suggest a root-only file with special writable pouches for "graphical icon
for the file" for each user on the system?!), so the idea in itself is
doomed from the start.

Then use it and be happy. No need to screw up Linux for that.

The descriptions might make sense to _you_, _now_. No guarantee they make
any sense (or are in the least useful) for other users on your system, and
I might want them in arabic or some such. The descriptions might make no
sense to you in a couple of years.

That's their (self-selected) job, yes.
