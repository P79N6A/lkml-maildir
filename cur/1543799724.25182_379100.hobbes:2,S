I don't have any big issues with it. However, I am not at home right now
and can't actually try it out on real hardware. It looks like it should
work as well as the version it is replacing. I'm pretty sure the IIsi
case was broken before. I think we should go ahead and commit this to
get rid of the issues it fixes, and then come back to it later and take
another pass at it to fix the fact that it has never worked in 2.6 on
some models. It's better than nothing.
