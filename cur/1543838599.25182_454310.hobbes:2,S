Hi,
Just an overall comment. I like the idea of simple plugins for HID but we
somehow need to allow them be built as modules and loaded on demand so
when I plug a device that needs special handling an appropriate piece
will get loaded and attached to the HID driver before my device is bound
to it. Built-ins are not very nice when you look from a distribution POV
becuase they have to enable every option and there are qute a few of devices
that need special handling.
