To whomever said that sched RR doesn't work, I added some diagnostics
to your code and it seems to work okay with linux 2.4.1.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<sched.h>
int main()
{
    struct sched_param sp;
    int ch, pr;
    ch = pr = 0;
    memset(&sp, 0x00, sizeof(sp));
    sp.sched_priority = 1;
    sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_RR, &sp);
    if(fork() == 0) {
        while(1) {
            ch++;
            printf(" child %d\n", ch);
            sched_yield();
        }
    }
    else {
        while(1) {
            pr++;
            printf("parent %d\n", pr);
            sched_yield();
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
