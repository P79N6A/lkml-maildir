Hi,
i have written a doc for the hack of the bootup linux logo.The document
contains the main program that produces the linux-logo.h header file and the
aquired measurements for the WIDTH & HEIGHT for the fbcon.c file.
Can this doc be included in the Documentation of the kernel.
Best regards,
Chris.
