Yes, basically the same race. But unlike thaw_tasks(), this is the error path,
it is not so critical to filter out the false warnings. We can't do this anyway.
Since try_to_freeze_tasks() failed, new processes can be created, we don't filter
out "TASK_TRACED && frozen(p->parent)", etc.

I am a bit confused by this patch. Which method it uses?

Isn't it better to clear PF_FREEZER_SKIP unconditionally? freezer_count() will
do try_to_freeze(), nothing more.
It is not safe to clear PF_FREEZER_SKIP in freezer_count() ater try_to_freeze().
PF_FREEZER_SKIP is a promise to to try_to_freeze(). try_to_freeze_tasks() fails,
does cancel_freezing(), a CLONE_VFORK parent returns from try_to_freeze() with
PF_FREEZER_SKIP set, and now comes another try_to_freeze_tasks() ?
Surely, this can't happen in practice, but still.
Oleg.
