No-go - we need that for filesystems.  But that's a separate story - if
MODULE_CONF() is there life already becomes much easier.

I suspect that in this case s/2.5/2.4-ac/ might be a possibility.  Since
we are talking about defaults, nothing is going to break if file simply
doesn't exist.  So teaching modprobe to handle it if it's there would
be a compatible change and would allow testing the kernel side of that
stuff.  Alan?
