hrmm..  It seems not even the mighty test8-pre6 can handle the cvs of X..  i'm using 90MB of swap
at the moment... and almost 4000 segments in shm..   it's like they never go away unless i kill X
...    still trying to find the latest cvs..   it appears the module xc is not the latest ..
confusing ..anyways ..  soon i will be compiling a new X and we shall see how it works.
