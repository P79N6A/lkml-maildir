Why? As I said you can use a glue layer. Note that you still
cannot mix /usr/include/net and /usr/src/linux/include/net anyway,
so clashes will always exist with the current system.
I agree it should probably be fixed.

But again as I said that is a different issue. This thread (with the
misleading Subject: header) is mostly about how to build modules
correctly.
There are 3 different issues here:
1. Consistent build environment for 3rd party modules
2. kernel-provided data structures for system daemons like autofs
3. kernel-provided data structures being used in glibc headers
I was merely talking about #1
