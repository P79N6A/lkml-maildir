Not the part that actually uses it.

So far the logic has been.
Inspect bzImage.  And get boot protocol version.
If field we need for returning data is not supported do not give
data.  Or something like that.  Usually the fields always exist
and you can just fill them in and we only append to the boot
protocol structure.
In practice this has been working for the last 7 years or so,
for EFI, and LinuxBIOS, and kexec, and Gujin and I don't remember what
else.
It isn't the prettiest thing in the world but it works and everybody
who needs it uses it.  Which tend to be the important parts for a
standard.
