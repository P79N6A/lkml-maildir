At work I'm seeing a lot of "dst cache overflow" message coinciding
with the machine being unusable (and needing a reboot to fix).
This might have started at the same time as I started using ssh to
access another machine (running solaris 2.8) - either ssh itself or
the fact that I'm now doing more network I/O (i.e the ssh session and
X applications running on the remote host).
This is on a 500Mhz PIII with an Ether Express NIC (unfortunately the
PC has the NIC integrated on the motherboard so I can't do much about
it).
With earlier kernels (2.3.18.ac[various]) I was seeing quite a few
transmit timeouts and subsequent resets which seem to have gone away
for the moment.
