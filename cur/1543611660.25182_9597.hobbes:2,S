Yes.  The problem shows up on ext2 partitions only.  I also have seen a
lockup in NWFS when
I have patched my FS into Linux.  The lockup indicates a deadlock in the
inode layers above
me.  I see this lockup when I have more than one file system mounted at a
time.  It does not happen
when only a single volume (superblock) has been mounted, only with
multiples.  Ditto the ext2
corruption.  It only shows up when more than one superblock is active.
Perhaps this will help
narrow down the problem.  Since I have a VFS of my own, I could help track
this down, but it
will be tommorrow, I am working on NWFS tools code today. :-)
