FYI Brett, some Opteron systems have a BIOS option to interleave memory.  If 
you are going to make use of NUMA, I think you want to not interleave.
Also, if you have a 25% imbalance within a domain/node, the scheduler can have 
a tendency to bounce around a task for fairness.  That might be why you are 
seeing little/no affinity to a cpu (even top might be causing some of this).   
Not sure what the threshold is between domains/nodes, but I am curious if it 
still happens with CONFIG_NUMA on.  If these are long lived cpu bound 
processes, I would try to have the number of processes be a multiple of the 
number of cpus.
