The last time I measured timer tick overhead on ia64 it was well below
1% of overhead.  I don't really like using kernel builds as a
benchmark, because there are far too many variables for the results to
have any long-term or cross-platform value.  But since it's popular, I
did measure it quickly on a relatively slow (old) Itanium box: with
100Hz, the kernel compile was about 0.6% faster than with 1024Hz
(2.4.18 UP kernel).
