it's not relevant to those embedded boards, but it's relevant to the AIO 
discussion, which centers around performance.

yeah. Nevertheless if you want to use -rt on your desktop (under Fedora 
4/5/6) you can track an rpmized+distroized full kernel package quite 
easily, via 3 easy commands:
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   wget 
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/rt.repo
   yum install kernel-rt.x86_64   # on x86_64
   yum install kernel-rt          # on i686
which is closely tracking latest upstream -git. (for example, the 
current kernel-rt-2.6.20-rc7.1.rt3.0109.i686.rpm is based on 
2.6.20-rc7-git1, so if you want to run a kernel rpm that has all of 
Linus' latest commits from yesterday, this might be for you.)
it's rumored to be a quite smooth kernel ;-) So in this sense, because 
this also runs on all my testboxes by default, it matters on modern 
hardware too, at least to me. Today's commodity hardware is tomorrow's 
embedded hardware. If a kernel is good on today's colorful desktop 
hardware then it will be perfect for tomorrow's embedded hardware.
