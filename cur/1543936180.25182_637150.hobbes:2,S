Since you're having problems with the very first part, I'm not sure I'd agree with your assessment. ;)
The fact is that the libertas chips are extremely moody, and Marvell has the weird attitude that there is one driver and one firmware per board/implementation, not per chip model. So friction is bound to appear when we try to have a generic driver that supports all of these different revisions.
So that means there's two options for you right now; experiment wildly and hope you get lucky and find how to avoid whatever bug your particular chip has, or try to get information from Marvell or Raon about how to interface with the chip.
