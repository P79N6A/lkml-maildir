Hmm, how does winxp and macosx get their respectives video modes,
what is missing in fbdev for that? MacOSX always gives you valid modes
including refresh rates per adaptor/monitor, WinXP always give you valid
modes and valid refresh rates for the video card, you actually
'Apply' to test, most of the time it simply works.

Great! i think your idea is great, does that library will be xserver
dependant or will be an independent lib so others projects like mine
could benefit from it?  Any bits somewhere?  This alone could boom
and revolutionize the graphics solutions for linux.  A step in the
right direction for "World Domination" in the desktop field.
