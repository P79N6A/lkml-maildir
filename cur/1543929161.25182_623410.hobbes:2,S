Since you put it this way...
I committed the attached (sorry) patch to kvm.git.   Rather than 
touching 2*($NARCH - 1) file, I changed include/linux/Kbuild to only 
export kvm.h if the arch actually supports it.  Currently that's just x86.

Subject: [PATCH] KVM: Export include/linux/kvm.h only if $ARCH actually supports KVM
Currently, make headers_check barfs due to <asm/kvm.h>, which <linux/kvm.h>
includes, not existing.  Rather than add a zillion <asm/kvm.h>s, export kvm.h
only if the arch actually supports it.
