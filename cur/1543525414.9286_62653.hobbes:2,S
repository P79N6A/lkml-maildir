Not likely for individual disks, but it makes sense if you are talking about a 
RAID array, or some other high capacity vault.
Just imagine the damage caused when an accidental (or intentional) flood of 
traffic saturates your LAN though.  These types of uses will need well 
isolated networks, but make sense for shared filesystems.  Unfortunately, they 
also need lots of software support to provide synchronization between hosts.  
This almost necessitates some minimal OS running on the disk vaults, unless 
you want to implement a modified MESI protocol or resource sharing over the 
wire.
