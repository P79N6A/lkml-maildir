I think that would only be the case when an application has an error. The
problem now is: Say you have two RT applications running, one living
in priority 0-49 and one in 50-99. Let us say the second has such an
error, like keep spawning threads whichs blocks on a mutex owned by a task
which is blocked forever. Without plists such an error will kill the high
priority RT task. With plists it will only see a _limited_ effect on it's
latency.
You can say plists is better at isolating applications wrt. timing than
ordinary sorted lists.
