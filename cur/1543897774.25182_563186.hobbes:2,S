[We touched on this a number of emails back.]
If an application is capability aware, it can manipulate its own
capabilities and should have fE=0.
If an application is not capability aware, it needs to have *all* of its
capabilities enabled at exec() time. Otherwise, it won't work.
The only reason for having an fE bitmap is to allow a capability-aware
program (you really trust to do its privileged operations carefully) to
be lazy and get some of its capabilities raised for free. Perhaps you
can clarify why this is a desirable thing? :-)
Cheers
