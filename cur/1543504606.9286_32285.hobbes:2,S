Hi outside,
I noticed that there are quite a lot of patches out there. I know - there 
is cvs and everything, but application of several patches on top of a 
vanilla kernel makes everything totally confusing to most "not-so-
well-informed-what-is-going-on".
Therefor I'm thinking about a patch addon routine for vanilla kernels. 
Base idea is: every wildely distributed patch should register (very 
simple) to a text file in source code, so you could cat this file and 
see which patches are installed (or this is a vanilla). I know there is 
an "extra version", but this line is
a) too short for this purpose
and
b) people does not like this, as you must do it by hand.
I have several more ideas, but first I want to hear whether you think 
that this idea is good (or not). Perhaps someone else has already 
got this idea or is already working on this. If so, please let me know, 
as I do not want to do "double-work".
Tell me, what you think!
