I wondered about it, because the flag is cleared when adma_enabled is 1,
which seems to be consistent with everything but nv_adma_check_atapi_dma.
Thus I thought that nv_adma_check_atapi_dma might be wrong, but maybe
setting/clearing the flag is wrong instead? *feels lost*

I just checked Maxtor's knowledge base, that incompatibility does not
affect my drive.
