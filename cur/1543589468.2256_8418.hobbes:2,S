on the surface, it looks like your systems don't have anything in common with
mine. i'm running rh71 too, but that's only because running kernel 2.4.2 on my
previous rh62 system corrupted the filesystem so badly that i had to format
and reinstall. i admit i'm somewhat glad to hear i'm not the only one having
these problems, but it obviously isn't particularly widespread. are you also
getting errors like this:
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)): ext2_readdir: bad entry in directory
#508411: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, inode=0, rec_len=0,
name_len=0 
the disk that becomes corrupted for me is an IBM Deskstar (UDMA 33), and it's on
an intel 440BX chipset. does anyone here have any thoughts?
thanks,
ian
