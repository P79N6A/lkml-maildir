ide-detect != ide-generic
In 2.4 you have to load ide-detect after loading chipset module.
In 2.6+patch you don't have to load anything after loading chipset module.
ide-detect is used for all chipset modules to probe for drives.
ide-generic is generic/default host driver - you use it only if you don't have
specific modules for your IDE chipsets.

Sure, it works for other *PCI* drivers, but not ie. PPC ones (easy to fix).
