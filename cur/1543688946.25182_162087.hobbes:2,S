Not really. From the diff manpage:
        -X FILE  --exclude-from=FILE
               Exclude files that match any pattern in FILE.
You may want to take a look at a copy of dontdiff (noting the shell 
patterns). It looks like dontdiff could be generated from mrproper's 
list of scratch files (with the exception of the '-size 0' test in the 
'find' command) but I could be wrong.
FWIW, the $(RCS_FIND_IGNORE) part skips some version-control directories 
that dontdiff doesn't mention. I guess the party line is that you should 
use the version control system for doing diffs in that case, but whatever.
If you try to replace dontdiff with a dynamically generated list, be 
sure and have a few folks test it out on different trees (including ones 
managed by BK and SVN) to make sure you haven't broken anything.
