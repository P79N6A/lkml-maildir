8.What is a feature freeze? 
(ADB) A feature freeze is when Linus announces on the linux-kernel list
that he will not consider any more features until the release of a new
stable kernel version. Usually the net effect of such an announcement is
that on the following days people on the list propose a flurry of new
features before Linus really enforces the feature freeze. ;-) 
9.What is a code freeze? 
(ADB) A code freeze is more restrictive than a feature freeze; it means
only severe bug fixes are accepted. This is a short phase that usually precedes the 
creation of a new stable kernel tree.
... based on this. I would say that Linux has been in an unenforced
"feature freeze" for about a year, but has not yet entered a "code
freeze," despite being in "2.4.0-test-X" stage for months, and
"2.3.99-pre-X" for nearly a year. 
Perhaps the real problem isn't the "feature freeze" but the numbering --
maybe we should still be in the "2.3.xxx" pre-nothing stage currently. Or
the FAQ needs to be updated.
