Isn't there some commentary around about one patch per email?
Please read
   
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
and
   
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
Also there was an email from Linus last week in the loooooong
"splitting kernel headers" thread about this.  In particular,
about doing lindent patches completely standalone.
That way we can review each patch on its own merit.
Thanks.
