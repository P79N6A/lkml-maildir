	Hello,
	what is the difference between the IFF_UP and IFF_RUNNING?
I have looked into the ifconfig's source, and the "ifconfig up" command
sets both the IFF_UP and IFF_RUNNING flags, while the "ifconfig down"
clears the IFF_UP only. This can mean that the IFF_UP is for 
"administrative status" of an interface (i.e. system administrator
want the interface to be active), and the IFF_RUNNING is the
"operative status" (in Cis*o terminology) - the line protocol
(keepalive/linefill, linkbeat) on the interface is running.
	Am I right with this guess? If so, then I think the
drivers/net/syncppp.c uses these two flags in the opposite sense:
The code around line 530 is the following:
                if (! (dev->flags & IFF_UP) &&
                    (dev->flags & IFF_RUNNING)) {
                        /* Coming out of loopback mode. */
                        dev->flags |= IFF_UP;
                        printk (KERN_INFO "%s: up\n", dev->name);
	I think device driver should never set the administrative
status (IFF_UP) itself, but can set the operative status (IFF_RUNNING),
if the line become OK (e.g. it gets correct LCP or keepalive packet).
