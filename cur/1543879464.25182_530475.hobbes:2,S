But traditionally the "normal environment" is a root fs not yet
mounted. Do the drivers need initramfs? Which drivers?
In both cases it's a bit before /sbin/init (or /init) is launched,
udevd isn't running and firmware can't be loaded.
OTOH when something goes wrong before console drivers are initialized,
nothing can be seen. And with initramfs (especially with the external
one) it's easy to screw something.
