I had missed that was in a preempt disable path when I skimmed through
the users.

I'm still wondering if we can move put_task_struct a little lower in
the logic in the places where it is called, so it isn't called under a
lock, or with preemption disabled.  The only downside I see is that it
might convolute the logic into unreadability.
In general I get nervous about calling big functions while holding locks.
