actually put this into period but it didn't take :-( period is still 25
and before you ask min_period is 12.5

did this anyway and this is what i got
May 19 20:21:45 porky kernel:  target0:0:0: Beginning Domain Validation
May 19 20:21:45 porky kernel: (scsi0:A:0): 3.300MB/s transfers
May 19 20:21:45 porky kernel: WIDTH IS 1
May 19 20:21:46 porky kernel: (scsi0:A:0): 6.600MB/s transfers (16bit)
May 19 20:21:46 porky kernel: (scsi0:A:0): 80.000MB/s transfers
(40.000MHz, offset 127, 16bit)
May 19 20:21:46 porky kernel:  target0:0:0: Ending Domain Validation
Any idea why I can't set the period to 12.5? I am going to see if
anything jumps out at me.
