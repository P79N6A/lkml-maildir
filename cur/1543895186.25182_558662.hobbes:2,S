Except when the bisection points us to a patch exposing a bug that is present
regardless (see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/13/273
 for example).
Besides, if a patch is merged before -rc1 as a bugfix, there are several
patches depending on it and only after -rc5 has been released we find out
that it breaks someone's system, then reverting it is not a solution, IMO.

People should test _all_ of the -rc kernels and report problems.  Otherwise, we
may assume that there are no problems and go on.
