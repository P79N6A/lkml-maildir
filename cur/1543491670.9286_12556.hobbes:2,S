Hi,
Among the patches for 2.2.5 was a "fix" for a certain
Goldstar CD-ROM drive. I've since learned that this is
only needed with certain chipsets, so if you are experiencing
problems with this drive in 2.2.5 please apply the following
patch.
I'd also like to hear from people using this model, whether
it works or not.
