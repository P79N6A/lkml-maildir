There are a couple of ways to deal with these:
 0) speak to the right persons: don't expect helpdesk can do anything
about these, especially don't expect anyone to "call you back".  Try to
get in touch with someone who is a network admin; if the bank is not a
kiosk with tiny amount of money in the safe, a whois database e.g. RIPE
might give some clues.  If helpdesk/network admin is clueless, ask to
speak with their supervisor.
 1) vote with your feet: switch the bank.  This is how modern economy
works; money is power.  Make sure they know you switched (or intend to
switch) banks, and why.  Make sure their boss, and the person somewhat in
charge of handling customer relations, knows it.
 2) make it (more) public: if there are potentially more people in the
area who this would concern, making this public, and causing the bank a
potential loss of 50 customers, not 1, might wake them to the reality.
 3) forget about it: just don't enable ECN.
And lastly: do not make them think of this as a Linux problem.  Their
software breaks Internet standards (soon, anyway :), and eventually they
will be shut out.  In many cases, the fix is free and easily installable.
.. Let's not start a huge thread (especially with this big Cc: list; there
should be a smaller forum to discuss this if necessary) on this though.
