Good point.
I have been using gcc-3.3 for awhile now with success, and I can
recommend it at least for x86, but that really is not reason to force
anyone to move to it (yet).
So this change will be nice when gcc 3.3 or greater is the minimum
compiler, but not very nice until then. If we start eradicating ifdefs
users of older compilers will get very bloated kernels.
I would also like it if we did not have to do the hackish inling
stuff...
