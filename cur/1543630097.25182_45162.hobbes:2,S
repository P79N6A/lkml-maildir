      Actually there is. Think iSCSI. Have a look at this article at 
   LinuxJournal - 
http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=4896
 .
The Linux networking stack need have no hand in any of the IPv4 done
by iSCSI, it can live entirely in the cards firmware and Linux need
not know what the transport looks like at all.
