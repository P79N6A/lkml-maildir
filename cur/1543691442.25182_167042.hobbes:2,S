This makes Synaptics lie about half of it's properties as it still reports 
EV_REL after switching to absolute mode. Also, reporting that Synaptics 
supports EV_TRIGGER will possibly confuse software as only joysticks (so far)
have it. I think this is wrong. Device should report only what it actually
has so userspace could reliable detect devices. 
We also can't just emulate relative events as everything is multiplexed into
/dev/input/mice and I can see many people using Synaptics via 
/dev/input/eventX and everything else via /dev/input/mice as it nicely handles
hot plugging (at least I use it this way).
Can't we just have compile option for Synaptics stating that new drivers are
needed and give links in help? By the time distributions pick up 2.6 they
will also package correct driver/GPM.
