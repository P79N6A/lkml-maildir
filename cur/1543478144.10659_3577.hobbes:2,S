Subject: HZ=1024 for CPU >= 586?

I recompiled 2.2.0pre7ac4 with HZ=1024 and the responsiveness of the
Mousecursor under X is significantly improved. Lagging keyboard input etc
etc have all been reduced.
Could we have the kernel increase the HZ for the modern faster CPUs?
F.e. leave it at 100 HZ for 386 486. Switch to 1024 for 586 and higher.
