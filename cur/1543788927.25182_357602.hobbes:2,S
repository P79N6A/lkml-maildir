Please pardon my ignorance, but what does 'cfr.' mean?

Sure, I will do so.

Well, this isn't really a change, it just enhances readability.

Why use typeof when you can specify the type. But again, this change 
does nothing. It reduces compile time a tad perhaps? :)
Must I go ahead and create a patch which removes the extra list_head 
member in the *_par structures?
