Check your hardware. Any other strange stuff happening, like unexplained
core files?
Look for memtest86 (f.ex. on 
http://www.freshmeaty.net
), it is a thorough
RAM tester. Or compile a lot of stuff, compiler crashes are usually signs
of bad RAM.
Run badblocks(8), it will check if your disk is OK. Run fsck(8) to check
the data on disk is OK (in format at least).
If your package management system allows you to check the integrity of what
you have installed (rpm does), use that. Maybe something got messed up on
the disk.
Good luck!
