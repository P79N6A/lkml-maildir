How annoying.

As it should.

It's because I never check if the MAX_ORDER block is valid before
isolating. This needs to be implemented just like what
isolate_freepages() and isolate_freepages_block() does. Change it to
pfn_valid() for the moment and I'll have this one fixed up properly in
the next version.
