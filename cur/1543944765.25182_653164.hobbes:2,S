Ok so the notifiers have to be handed over to the user space library that 
has the function of the device driver here...

You only need to check if a handle has been receiving invalidates. If not 
then you can just go ahead as now. You can use the notifier to take down 
the whole region if any reclaim occur against it (probably best and 
simples to implement approach). Then you mark the handle so that the 
mapping is reestablished before the next operation.
