Yes.  That one was missing.

Correct.  The calling sequence is
	nlmsvc_retrieve_args()	/* increments */
	nlmsvc_unshare_file()	/* decrements if share is removed */
	nlm_release_file()		/* decrements */
so f_count will be at least 2 when nlmsvc_unshare_file() finds a share
to remove.  In nlmsvc_traverse_shares(), the surrounding retrieve/release
calls are missing, so the minimum f_count is 1.

nlm_release_file() *does* grab the semaphore.  That's the problem.

Adding or removing blocks or locks does not affect f_count at all.
There ist one function that changes f_count when it removes a block,
but it is never called, at least not in 2.2.x.
The min_count test is irrelevant (TM) anyway.  In fact, I could have used
a simple `file->f_count--;' instead of `put_file();' (feel free to
do that yourself), but I'm paranoid and wanted lockd to complain if
something goes wrong.  The min_count values are correct, however.
