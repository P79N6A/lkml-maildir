Good question !

I've been checking my logs, and the difference is quite constant and
huge :

Hmmmm.... That could make it a problem related to kernel rather than CPU.

If I recall correctly, issues with AMD X2 where related to TSC being
independant for each core and not constant (speed depending of C state).
But the reason I raise the issue is that the Core2 reports constant TSC,
so there is (IMHO) no reason for that.
