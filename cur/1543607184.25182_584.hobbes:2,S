That's simply note true, as many windows
users have pointed out to you.

nvidia is the party who maintains the nvidia driver -
and they have stated that they do not support "pre"
kernel releases. Therefore, you ought to stick with
official releases.
(Funny, I never have that problem with my voodoo3!)
Also, you mentioned "customers" - most customers
would take a dim view of a sys admin who reboots
systems left and right to try various "pre" kernels!
You had best install the distro and leave it at that,
except of course that you keep up with updates.
