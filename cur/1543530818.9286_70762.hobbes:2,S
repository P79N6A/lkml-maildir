i think that it would be pretty interesting to have a SIGLOWMEM that was
sent to a task before any of its pages were swapped out.  this would
allow garbage-collected language systems and programs to only spend
time garbage-collecting when there's actually any need to do so, and
without having to have a fixed heap size like the JVM does.  Most apps
would ignore it and get paged out, but some would trim themselves down
to a more reasonable size and avoid being paged.  this is unrelated to
overcommitting memory, but you brought it to mind :-)
