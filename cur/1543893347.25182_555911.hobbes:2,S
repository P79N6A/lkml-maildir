Yes, I think you're correct.  I found a south bridge spec.,
http://www.tser.org/vt8231/vt8231.pdf,
 and I don't see a pin for driving
an IDE RESET-.
Oh well, I suppose I either dike out RESET- from the IDE cable and wire
it up to a serial or parallel port, or give up using a PC for the task
and use a dedicated circuit.
Thanks for your help.
Ralph.
