You've posted this about 4 times, you can be sure we've seen every one
of them, please don't post it again ok? :-)  Just wait patiently for
someone to look at this problem, thanks.
FWIW, this looks like it has been caused by some platform specific
or generic PCI layer changes.  It doesn't look like a tg3 driver
bug at all, as it's just looking for the PCI resource for the
register mapping which should always just work if the PCI layer
is behaving.
