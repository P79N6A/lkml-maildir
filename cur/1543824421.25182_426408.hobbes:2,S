Yes, check your /etc/fstab.  You're trying (explicitly) to mount an ext3 filesystem as 
ext2, but your /etc/fstab contains ext3-related options.  This means that mount(8) will 
try to add them to the remount, and the remount will fail because you're passing options 
to the filesystem that the filesystem doesn't understand.
