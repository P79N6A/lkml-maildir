Yes.  This is done in several places in the ext2 kernel sources, like
ext2_read_inode().  Note that it is not a simple calculation, because
the position of the inode table can (although generally does not) vary
on a per-group basis.  On a cold cache, you would need to do 2 reads
to calculate the inode block location (superblock + group descriptor).

On a "sparse superblock" filesystem, superblock and group descriptor
backups are kept in groups 0 and those numbered 3^n, 5^n, 7^n, where
n is an integer.  So, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 25, 27.
Groups that do not have backups generally will contain the block bitmap,
inode bitmap, inode table, and data.  However, the actual position will
be given in the group descriptor table.
Cheers, Andreas
