Hi
I am trying to compile the kernel source code of .c files in 
/linux-2.6.17.11/net/ieee80211 in  a standalone manner. My aim is to 
profile these files, especially the security functions, and to find the 
bottlenecks in the implementation and then to fine tune it.
While compiling them as
 gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I ../../kernel2/linux-2.6.17.11/include ieee80211_crypt.c
I initially got error with KBUILD but was able to remove it. Now 
following are the errors I am getting.

can someone tell me how can i get over with these errors ? Moreover is 
there any other way of profiling the specific module (/net/ieee802.11) 
through which i can find out the bottleneck ???
ThanX
