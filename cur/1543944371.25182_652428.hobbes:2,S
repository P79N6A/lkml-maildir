Well, I don't really "review" any patches that come through Andrew. What I 
do is:
 - global search-and-replace Andrew's "acked-by:" with one that is both 
   him and me (that way I make sure that I _only_ sign off on patches that 
   he has signed off on!)
 - look through all the commit *messages* (but not patches). This 
   sometimes involves also editing up grammar etc - some of those messages 
   just make me wince - but it also tends to include things like adding 
   commit one-liner information if only a git commit ID is mentioned etc.
 - and only for areas that I feel competent in, I look at the patches too.
So, to take an example, when Andrew passes on uml patches that only touch 
arch/um and include/asm-um, my sign-off does not mean *any* kind of review 
at all. It's purely a sign that it's passed the sign-off requirements 
properly.
When it comes to VM issues or other things, things are different, and I 
actually review the patch (and occasionally send it back with "nope, I'm 
not applying this"). But for stuff that comes through Andrew, that's 
probably less than a quarter of the patches. And I don't mark the ones 
I've reviewed specially in any way.
And I suspect I'm not at all alone in this. People simply have maintainers 
they trust (and _need_ to trust in order to not become a bottleneck).
