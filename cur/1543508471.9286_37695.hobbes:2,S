The kernel doesn't know about usernames, only about user ids. This is
a userspace (glibc) issue. I think libc5 did indeed limit you to
8 characters, but who uses libc5 nowadays ;)
So if you use glibc, you can have long usernames. If they may or
may not start with a number depends more on the tools on the rest
of your system.
