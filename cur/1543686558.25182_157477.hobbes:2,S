You should allow for changes that are "formatting change only", with no
actual code structural change.
You could pass the results through stage 1 of gcc, and only allow it if the
parsing tree is identical.
I was originally going to suggest just passing it through "indent", but
that would not come out right, if someone added braces to clarify a
one-line conditional.
