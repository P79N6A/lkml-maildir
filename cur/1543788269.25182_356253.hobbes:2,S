Of course. I was just saying that it might be better for users if you, 
Nigel and the other parties involved collaborated on getting suspend2 
merged instead of working on 2 or 3 separate implementations. My gut 
feeling is that it would be quicker to do that than to nail the sucky 
low-level bugs that are bound to come up when developing the new uswsusp 
framework.
And now, since there's nothing I can actually do to help this - you 
can't learn to be a kernel hacker in two weeks - I'll shut up. But I 
just wanted to remind everyone involved that from a user's perspective, 
it would be great if suspend2 were merged.
It works, it's fast, it's stable, and it does what users want. That's a 
strong combination. It would be really good if you could work together 
to merge it.
Cheers,
Lorenzo
