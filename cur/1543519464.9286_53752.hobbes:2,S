Unfortunately, this is a known problem.  When i was calculating the
timings for rivafb, i could only test them on my tnt2, so we have some
problems with 128's.  I'm gonna review some riva info just sent to me and
see if i can get any clues as to nv3 (riva128) timings.  If you feel
adventerous, you could try playing with my timing values in
riva_load_video_mode() and see if you can get anything.
Thanks,
ani
