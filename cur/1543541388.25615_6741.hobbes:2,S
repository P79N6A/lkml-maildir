Nononononono, gcc on the m68k does 'natural' alignments to two byte
boundaries and not 4 bytes. Yes it sucks and no we cannot change it
now.
If you use structures to describe hardware you should *always*
perform explicit padding and never ever expect the compiler to do it
for you. Just because it works on one architecture doesn't mean the
alignments will be the same on another, and it is not just a question
of fixing the compiler, if the architecture ABI says on thing then
thats normally what to listen to.
