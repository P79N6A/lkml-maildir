Hello Greg,
Thanks for the support and prompt response. I figure it out the problem is endianess. I worked everything on x86 based system and copied files to PPC system. Somehow I forgot to change the endianess define in my makefile. Now everything works fine!
Again, relay appreciate your help!
Eddie

Do you have a pointer to your source code, so we can look at it to see
what is wrong?
