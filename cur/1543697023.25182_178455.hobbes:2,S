Dear Kernel developers,
I would wish to add to MySQL profiling of CPU and system usage, which
would allow for example to see amount of system/user CPU needed to
process particular query as well as amount of IO needed.
With LinuxThreads I probably can use times() or getrusage() for this
purpose, as Threads share a lot of infrastructure with processes. 
This however would not work with NPTL threads.
Are there any ways to get similar information for thread rather than
process ?
Second question is about accuracy -  Is any way to get system/user CPU
consumption information with more than 1/100 sec accuracy ?
Thank you for your advices.
