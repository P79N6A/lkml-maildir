I can add the BLKGETSIZE ioctl if you like, but in general the block
device ioctls just don't make any sense for raw devices.  In addition
to the getsize call, there are calls for cache invalidation and so on,
and these cases are inappropriate for an uncached device.
What ioctls actually make sense for raw devices?  BLKGETSIZE is one,
but it's the only one I'd add unless there good reasons for adding any
others.
Cheers, 
 Stephen
