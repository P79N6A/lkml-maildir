Hi, I was looking at your patch:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/21/132
Very small, which is nice.
I was wondering if there were any interest in my own efforts in that
direction:
http://dedasys.com/freesoftware/patches/blkdev_wakeup.patch
which is far more intrusive, and perhaps isn't good kernel programming
style, but, on the other hand, is the optimal solution in terms of
boot time because it wakes up the boot process right when the device
comes on line.
Since I saw your patch included, it looks like there is interest in
this, and I'd toot my own horn once more before just leaving my patch
to the bit rot of the ages...
Thanks!
