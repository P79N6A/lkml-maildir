Hrm! We do. 
http://locke.catalyst.net.nz/gitweb?p=moodle.git;a=heads
shows a lot of heads that share 99% of the code. The repo is ~90MB --
and we check each head out with cogito, develop and push. It is a
shared team repo, using git+ssh and sticky gid and umask 002.
Works pretty well I have to add. The only odd thing is that the
fastest way to actually start working on a new branch is to ssh on to
the server and cp moodle.git/refs/heads/{foo,bar} and then cg-clone
that bar branch away. Perhaps I should code up an 'cg-branch-add
--in-server' patch.

martin
