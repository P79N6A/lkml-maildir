It seems that vendor kernels lack most DoS-related fixes.  I'm only
aware of a single vendor which tracks them to the point that CVE names
are assigned.
Vendor kernels are not a panacea, either.  With some of the basic
support contracts (in the four-figure range per year and CPU), the
vendor won't look extensively at random kernel crashes which could (in
theory) be attributed to faulty hardware, *and* you don't get
community support for these heavily patched kernel collages.
