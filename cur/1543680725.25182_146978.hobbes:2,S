One more clue: I booted with init=/bin/bash. It got to the bash prompt.
I did an 'ls' (I was at /). It showed all the entries _DUPLICATED_ 
( two /bin, two /boot ....), and then panic'ed again.
So perhaps it is some code in the fs layer what is miscompiled...
The system hangs as soon as I touch the disk.
