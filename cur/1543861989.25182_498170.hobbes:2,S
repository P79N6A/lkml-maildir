I thought the same thing, but Jeff pointed out that
nfsctl_transaction_write does ops based on inode numbers, and they maybe
can't move around?
        rv =  write_op[ino](file, data, size);
However, nfsd's call to simple_fill_super already sends in a set of
files starting at inode 2:
enum {
        NFSD_Root = 1,
        NFSD_Svc,
...
        static struct tree_descr nfsd_files[] = {
                [NFSD_Svc] = {".svc", &transaction_ops, S_IWUSR},
...
        return simple_fill_super(sb, 0x6e667364, nfsd_files);
which does...
      for (i = 0; !files->name || files->name[0]; i++, files++) {
                if (!files->name)
                        continue;
...
                inode->i_ino = i;
So I think it's already expecting the root inode at one, and the other
files starting at 2?
