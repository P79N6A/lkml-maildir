I'm absolutely convinced some people won't be happy, simply
because of the fundamental limitations of global page replacement.
However, Andrew Morton has done a great job and the 2.5 VM seems
to be looking as good as anything we've had before.
For me 3.0 arguments would be Ingo's threading stuff, not anything
else.

Rik
