Yes, Itanium has a two-level DTLB, McKinley has both ITLB and DTLB
split into two levels.  Not quite as big though: "only" on the order
of hundreds of entries (partially offset by larger page sizes).  Of
course, operating the hardware walker in hashed mode can give you an
L3 TLB as large as you want it to be.

The software fill can definitely do that.  I think it's one area where
some interesting experimentation could happen.
