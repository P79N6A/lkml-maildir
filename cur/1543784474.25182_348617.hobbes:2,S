Is there a virtual device that would allow to connect the communication paths 
from the physical devs into the kernel netlink subsystem in a way that would 
be more flexible than what is currently avaible?
Something like this:
    Kernel-netlink
        |
    virtual dev
        |
--> mapper/conf <--
        |
    physical dev(s)
tun/tap,bridge,bond... are devs that incorporate this idea, but don't allow 
for a flexible configuration.
Thanks!
