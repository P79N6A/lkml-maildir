Hello,

Okay, sorry. I did not read the leading text inside kernel-parameters.txt. 
Just did a grep acpi and looked for the listed lines.

I will try this later, What does this timer-fix mean for my system?

I have stopped the sound and have removed all sound modules (Init-script did 
this for me ;-) ) I have checked, if the modules had been removed (lsmod). I 
did a cat /proc/interrupts and: IRQ22 had ohci_hcd for itself. After that I 
tried to do a hotplug restart, but the init-script was unable to restart it. 
It did nothing, just waiting. I could not break it with CTRL+C.
So, USB does not work, even when sound is not running.
I also tested my SCSI-controller, but that seems to work okay, although it had 
some problems aborting a command (I copied a 400MB file and pressed CTRL+C 
after about 230MB). Here is the output:

I have booted the system without specifying apic (Seems to be noapic, because 
of XT-PIC in /proc/interrupts) and with lapic. In both cases, TV is working 
without any problems. Only specifying apic explicitly, freezes the system.
