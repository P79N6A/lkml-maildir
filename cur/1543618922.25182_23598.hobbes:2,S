Mr. Landley,
	WOW!
	I think you have described the problem EXACTLY. Just from what I have
read on lkml, it would seem that all the stuff that you describe is accurate.
I think that what you've written is very well written, clearly describes
what you believe must be done, and shows how having this new job would be
beneficial.
	BTW, I posted an article on KernelTrap (www.kerneltrap.com).
Thanks,
Brad
