Heh, actually Dave the single_sg_ok flag used to specify just that, but
Arjan noted that we never needed to trust that functionality when
!can_dma_32. So now can_dma_32 being set implies that the HBA driver
also gets the single sg entry correct.
To answer Gerard's question -- with can_dma_32 set, scsi_merge will set
the correct bounce value based on the PCI device DMA mask set. So dma_32
is indeed a misnomer, it was introduced before we supported full 64-bit
dma, and should now just be called can_highmem_io or something similar.
