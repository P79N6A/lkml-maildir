Well something like this could happen, in theory, on a "32-bit" architecture
with a 16-bit bus.  In that case, one can imagine, the first word of the
first write may be sent through the bus immediately followed by the first
word of the second write, followed by the second word of the second
write and by the second word of the first write, in this order.

Yes, it would be good to know that for sure.
