Subject: [PATCH] Trivial, add missing newline at EOF in Documentation/sound/oss/ChangeLog.multisound

Missing newlines at the end of files make them less pleasing to work with
for a number of tools that work on a line-by-line basis, and for source files
it will cause gcc to emit a warning. So, I desided to add that missing
newline to the few files in the kernel that are missing it.
This patch makes no functional changes at all to the kernel.
Patch is against 2.6.7-rc2
Here's the patch adding a newline to Documentation/sound/oss/ChangeLog.multisound
