   A heavily loaded webserver with NATed ip addresses. Would this not
   result in many server processes looking up the same ip address ?
The more common situation is server N IP (where N is 1 or a very small
number), destination clients == thousands of IPs.
So looking up the same dst cache entry with each benchmark client
is very unrealistic.  Try a unique IP address for every single lookup.
