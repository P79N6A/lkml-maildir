I completely agree, and I couldn't have put it better!  Kernel
programmers really should know exactly why, what, where and for how long
they are holding a lock.
This is why, incidently, I don't like any of the so-called lockless
schemes, including the original unix kernel monitor lock (i.e. only one
kernel thread active at a time), because they encourage unmaintainable
code where the critical sections are invisible to everyone and are
easily broken when someone accidently inserts a blocking function into
one of the invisible critical sections.
