Please don't. cpus_addr() is useful when you need to get a
handle on the representation for non-cpumask_t operations.
Case in point: the perfctr kernel extension needs to communicate
a cpumask_t to user-space because of the asymmetric nature of
HT P4s. Unfortunately, a simple copy_to_user() won't work because:
a) the size depends on kernel .config, and
b) the representation is defined in terms of sequences of ulong,
   which breaks 32-bit applications on 64-bit kernels.
So perfctr instead converts a cpumask_t to a sequence of uint,
and copies both the number of uints and the uints themselves
to user-space.
Having to do this conversion with a for-each-CPU type loop would
be slow and ugly, and would IMO show that the cpumask_t ADT had
become an obstacle to the actual work that needs to be done.
So please keep cpus_addr().
