Hi Mikael,
Thank you for reviewing.

This code checks whether unknown_nmi_panic is changed to another state.
Only when state is changed, I'd like to go next step.
old_state  unknown_nmi_panic   condition
0          0                 : TRUE(no change, return)
none zero  none zero         : TRUE(no change, return)
0          none zero         : FALSE(changed, go next step)
none zero  0                 : FALSE(changed, go next step)

The only one user can obtain NMI callback.
If unknown_nmi_panic is 0 at this step, it says that I have obtained
NMI callback before.
So, I think invoking release_lapic_nmi() has no problem.
