Remember that the names we are talking about here is the English 
descriptive name of the PCI device...  there is only _one_ need for 
these names:  /proc/pci
If there is going to be this much thought put into it (what a waste of 
brain cycles <g>), then let's just remove CONFIG_PCI_NAMES and the name 
field completely.  lspci prints them out from its own database anyway, 
and the only _real_ use is to provide descriptive names for devices in 
/proc/pci.  Why bother?  For existing code, just use pdev->slot_name 
instead, which is what happens anyway for hotplugged devices that appear 
after we drop the PCI name database during the __init phase.
