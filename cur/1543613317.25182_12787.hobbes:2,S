I think generally temporary files should go to /tmp and not the home
directory, but yes, there may be reasons to write to specific files in
the home directory as well.

Why would the slave not be able to read/map dynamic libraries in my
sceeme? Such files should be readable by everyone, so I don't see the
problem?
With ACL support I don't see this beeing limited at all. The process can
be given any rights you desire before changing it's effective userid.
