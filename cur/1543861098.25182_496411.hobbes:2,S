Can't do.
int f(void)
{
	return 0;
}
int g(void)
{
	return 0;
}
int is_f(int (*p)(void))
{
	return p == f;
}
main()
{
	printf("%d %d\n", is_f(f), is_f(g));
}
would better produce
1 0
for anything resembling a sane C compiler.  Comparing pointers to
functions for equality is a well-defined operation and it's not
to be messed with.
You _can_ compile g into jump to f, but that's it.  And that, AFAICS,
is what gcc does.
