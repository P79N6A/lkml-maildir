Thanks for the explanation, I've been struggling to understand what
Yoshfuji tried to explain to me earlier on this topic (see "IPv6 bugs
introduced in 2.4.21" - ie. my bogus bugreport), now it all makes
perfect sense :-)

If you don't have anything but one /64 for example.. I guess /126's
would be ok as you could rule out the the anycast address? It will
probably work with Linux - but is it wrong in any sense, other than
"breaking" with EUI-64/autoconfiguration?
