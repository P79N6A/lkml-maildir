Hi 
I got an address pointer from mmap system call is 0x40c23000. Is it user
space address? 
Is user application can directly access it?
System configuration is:
Intel Architecture 32 bit address space.
Red Hat Linux 7.3 with 2.4.18-3 kernel version.
Any help greatly appreciated.
Thanks and regards,
Srinivas G
