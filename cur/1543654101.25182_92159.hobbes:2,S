On the NFS-server I'm using RedHat kernel 2.4.18-10smp, according to
dmesg I'm using version 3.6 of reiser: 
reiserfs: checking transaction log (device 3a:00) ...
Using r5 hash to sort names
ReiserFS version 3.6.25
(The block device is LVM by the way)
Clients are both Linux and Solaris. 
To reproduce do something like: 
$ ls -li RMAIL
 387607 -rw-------    1 tm       4050     36635726 Nov 20 16:15 RMAIL
on the nfs-client, (obviously on a NFS-file) and wait a bit, varying
from a few minutes to many hours and the inode-number will be
different. I'm guessing the period you have to wait is dependent on
how much else is going on on the NFS-server.
I have no reason to suspect any data-corruption, md5 of file as well
as atime, ctime and mtime are unchanged.
