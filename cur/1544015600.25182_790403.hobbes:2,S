Damn.  I wonder if netconsole's initialization is turning around and stomping
on everything?  This looks suspicious:
static int tg3_open(struct net_device *dev)
 {
        struct tg3 *tp = netdev_priv(dev);
        int err;
 
+       if (tp->fw_needed) {
Do we know for sure that tp-> struct is the same one we set up back in
tg3_request_firmware, *and* that tg3_open() doesn't get called before
tg3_init_one() (which would result in an uninitialized fw_needed)?
