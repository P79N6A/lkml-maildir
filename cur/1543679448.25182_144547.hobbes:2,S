Yes, I use an "Option 'Globetrotter' GPRS Data Card" which also does Tri-band 
GSM.
I use it with the 'Orange' network in the UK. I understand that Vodafone also 
rebrand this card.
In GSM mode it works as a regular serial modem (with 2.4.x) and I assume the 
GPRS part works if you change the number to dial to be the funny #*33 style 
one.
Mark.
