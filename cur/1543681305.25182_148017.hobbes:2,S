Pavel, I disagree. This is important functionality. I *do* want to abort
suspends by pressing 'Esc'.
I do not believe that hiding this gives you any extra security, and I do
not believe that having it in is any kind of a problem. None of your
arguments against it convinced me.
Please do not try to hide it and obscure it any more than it already is
(Nigel has made this default to off for some reason).
