Although we have a per-cpu area base in a fixed global register
for addressing, the above isn't beneficial on sparc64 because
the atomic is much slower than doing a:
	local_irq_disable();
	nonatomic_percpu_memory_op();
	local_irq_enable();
local_irq_{disable,enable}() together is about 18 cycles.
Just the cmpxchg() part of the atomic sequence is at least
32 cycles and requires a loop:
	while (1) {
		x = ld();
		if (cmpxchg(x, op(x)))
			break;
	}
which bloats up the atomic version even more.
