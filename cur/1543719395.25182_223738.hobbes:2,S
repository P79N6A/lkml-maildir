2.6 no longer seems to support copying files via sys_sendfile(), only
files to sockets. It gets stuck at do_sendfile()
if (!out_file->f_op || !out_file->f_op->sendpage)
None of the file systems has a sendpage function, is this intentional?
After googling around I saw this has resulted in some broken programs. 
Was the semantics of sendfile() simply changed and in that case why,
cause it should be a bit of a speed booster to many applications.
