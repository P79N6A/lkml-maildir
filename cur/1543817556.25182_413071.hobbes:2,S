Should it be disabled or enabled? BTW it seems that the Marvell 3.6.1
propriety controller driver doesn't exhibit this problem so we can 
exclude hardware faults.
It looks more like a problem between the controller and the driver. 
I'm not an expert in PCI, but according to my observation so far, 
the PCI_STATUS_SIG_TARGET_ABORT bit is turned on in the config space 
after the driver is unloaded and that might indicate something bad.
 kernel: PCI config space regs: 
-kernel: 00: 608111ab 02b00317 01000009 00002008  
+kernel: 00: 608111ab 02b80713 01000009 00002008
