 Near as I can tell, it's listed in /proc/interrupts, and
inserting/removing cards definately causes the counter to increment. I'm
using pcmcia-cs-3.1.27's i82365. Also, dmesg shows it requesting the PCI
IRQ. Ie, I get messages like:
...
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.27
  kernel build: 2.2.19 #2 Sat Jul 14 12:21:14 EDT 2001
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [apm]
PCI routing table version 1.0 at 0xfdf60
  00:03.0 -> irq 11
  00:03.1 -> irq 11
Intl PCIC probe:
  TI 1251B rev 00 PCI-to-CardBus at slot 00:03, mem 0x6800000
...
I just inserted and removed my aironet card, and the value in
/proc/interrupts went from 9 to 14.. 
Could this be a problem in yenta_socket()'s initialization sequence?
Thanks, Martin
