Hi Antonio,
Thanks for the feedback. I'm just going to reply to one of your
comments and leave the rest for Nicolas...

Yes, it's intentional. This way, the atmel_lcdfb_probe function can be
__init since it doesn't need to be referenced from atmel_lcdfb_driver.
Saves a bit of memory at run time.
The downside is that hot plugging won't work, but that isn't very
relevant for on-chip devices anyway.
