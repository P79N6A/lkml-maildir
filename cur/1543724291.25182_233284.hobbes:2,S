No, just leave them unadorned.  I.e. the aim would just be to avoid the 
penalty of being on the "unlikely" path not to get special treatment.

It's not the time taken to do the check that's the issue. 
Unlikely/likely come with the warning that the "unlikely" path will take 
longer than it would otherwise have taken and consequently should only 
be used when you're pretty confident that your assessment of the 
likelihood is correct AND you're willing to pay a time penalty on the 
"unlikely" path whenever it is chosen.  My point is that I think that 
that penalty is unacceptable during "wake up".

They are talking very small times.
