The gcc docs seem clear that the "unused" attribute is just to defeat
the warning -- after all what would be the _point_ otherwise, since you
could just #ifdef the function.  Even if gcc were to make that change
it would just mean that <linux/init.h> gets a little more code dependant
on __GNUC__.  Hopefully by then gcc will correctly recognize aliases as
a use of a static symbol.  Granted, this means that old kernels won't
compile with a new gcc, but it's not like that's never happened before.
