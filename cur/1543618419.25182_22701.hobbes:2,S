I've asked the same question yesterday on the phone.
The explanation is pretty simple:
1) the video driver gets free pages for the agp
   data structures
2) the speculative store doesn't cross page
   boundaries
This means that when using 4kB pages instead of 4MB
pages the agp data is "fenced off" from the other
kernel data.
kind regards,
Rik
