kernel.org front page sayz:
Aug 21, 2003: Please don't use finger.kernel.org for any sort of 
automatic monitoring. The number of automatic bots hitting this port is 
causing the finger daemon to shut down more often than not. The same 
information is available from 
http://www.kernel.org/kdist/finger_banner.
