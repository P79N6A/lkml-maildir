rt/sched: ensure interrupts are disabled during post-schedule() processing
Impact: Fix run-time opps at boot up.
post-schedule() is required to run with interrupts disabled, but we
currently rely on the caller to have left them disabled for us.  This
has apparently changed recently such that interrupts are now on and
we thus crash.  Fix this once and for all by using the irqsave/restore
variants of spin_lock(rq).
