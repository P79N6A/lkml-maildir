	I am not so sure this is a fair comparison .  The reason I am
	saying this is (a while back) someone had mentioned that some
	instructions can have the cpu generate more heat .  But, I never
	did hear of any proof of the concept .
	Now this is in a sparc20 chassis right ?

	Hmmm, this still smells of something wrong .  & probably with
	the cpu's .  IF you have put other cpu types in & the difficulties
	diminished or completely went away or were differant .
	Fyi, sbus option cards don't put more heat on the cpu's in a
	sparc20 chassis .  The airflow is from power supply toward the
	option cards .  Thus the power supply gets the coolest air then
	the cpu's then the sbus cards .  But they (of course) do draw
	more current .  Which is another item I am worried about in the
	sparc20 chassis is max. current draw at rated voltage .  Which
	if the voltage drops will cause more heat in the system .

	I had just the one 4GB IBM sca (dchs04y) , which was warm but
	nowhere near as warm as th cpu's .  Mine was configured as such
	2) Ross Hyper-sparc 66Mhz cpu's
	4) Dram simms totaling 128MB 
	1) Vsimm 8Mb 
	0) sbus options
	1) 4GB IBM sca (dchs04y) HD.
	1) sun 1.44 floppy .
	Now I have the slower Ross cpu's in the chassis & no more heat
	problems air flowing out is temp nominal (afaict) ,  & the install
	is continuing un-eventful .  Twyl,  JimL
