I had something similar (and most strangely enough, it only seemed to happen
when the source and/or destination address was outside a given subnet). It
boiled down to that some switch acted really strange and God knows why. A
tcpdump on *both* sides (server+client) each showed that the *other* peer sent
a FIN/RST. Well in the end I settled with setting sys.net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0,
no idea if the broken switch got replaced in the meantime.
Well, just letting you know that it is not limited to computers.
