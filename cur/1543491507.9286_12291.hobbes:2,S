Quite unlikely - the major is registered quite soon in the init_module
function, so, there would need to be a major memory-overwriting bug
in the timer calibrating routine, which I doubt.

From the logs the cause of this is clear - the joystick is both compiled
into the kernel, and attempted to load as a module after the sound card
is initialized. This, of course, can't work, since the joystick driver
will try to register major 15 in both cases, and in the second it'll fail.
Btw, some of the logs also show that the sound module is compiled into
the kernel, and some only have it inserted as a module ...
I think the answer is to check the configuration, and re-compile and
re-install the kernel.
On the other hand, all the config files show CONFIG_JOYSTICK = m, which
is odd.
Have fun,
