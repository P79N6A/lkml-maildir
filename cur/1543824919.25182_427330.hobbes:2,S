Subject: [PATCH -rt 0/2] Get x86_64 running with PREEMPT_RT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following two patches get PREEMPT_RT running on x86_64.  I'm currently
writing this from my x86_64 box running 2.6.16-rt23.
The first patch probably only affected me, since it was caused by
having clocksource=XXX in the command line.
The other patch simply fixes a bad condition in the default_idle
which prevented the idle task from ever scheduling (that was bad!)
