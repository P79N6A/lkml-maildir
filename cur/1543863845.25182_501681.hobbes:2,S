For the pid namespace this seems to be correct placement.
For the mount namespace this would seem to exacerbate the problem
because it now gets called after the task has been reaped!
I'd love to be convinced otherwise but I do not believe we
can safely exit both the mount and the pid namespace at the
same location in the code.
The NFS unmount currently wants a killable thread as it
uses interruptible sleeps.  How does starting that process
after the process in which it lives aid this?
But thanks for remembering this.  This is a real problem we
do need to solve.
