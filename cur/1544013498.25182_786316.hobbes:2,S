It'll break on x86 if gcc decides to cache the value and you don't have
explicit barriers. If the long is not aligned it's not safe on x86 at all.

We should always tell people to use atomic/set_bit etc. There *are* cases
you can get away with it but it is far far better that the default is the
safe one because most driver writers do not have a detailed knowledge of
gcc code generation, processor quirks and barriers. If in a specific case
its a performance hit then its worth optimising that case.
