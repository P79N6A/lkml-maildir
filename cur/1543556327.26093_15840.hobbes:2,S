More than one queue worker running, for example. On systems with that much  
mail, that's just about essential to have.
But I suspect scanning the directory is much worse than renaming. Scanning  
long ext2 (or traditional Unix, for that matter) directories gets *really*  
ugly. That's why Exim, for example, has the "split spool directory" code  
(works very similar to the traditional terminfo split).

Exactly.

I don't think I've seen that. Possibly if you're doing massive directory  
creation just at that moment (unpacking a kernel source tarball, say), but  
in that case I'd call it expected on a non-journalling fs.
If anything, I've seen chopped-up regular files (usually stuff like spool  
files the MTA was just messing around with).
