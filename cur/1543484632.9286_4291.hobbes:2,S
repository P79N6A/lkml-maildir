No. findfast does not scan partitions -- it scan disks ! And if Windows98 will
not find Linux partition (and how Windows98 could find partition of type 83
anyway?) what bad could happens with it ? BTW I'm have the following
configuration here:
  hda1->Windows 98  (FAT12, boot)
  hda2->Windows NT  (FAT12, boot)
  hda3->MS DOS 6.22 (FAT12, boot)
  hda4->Extended
  hda5->Windows 98  (FAT32, D:\WINDOWS)
  hda6->Windows NT  (NTFS,  D:\WINNT)
  hda7->Windows 3.11(FAT16, D:\WINDOWS)
  hda8->Linux native(EXT2FS)
  hda9->Linux swap
and Windows98 is NOT confused by both Linux partitions and Windows NT (NTFS)
partitions !
