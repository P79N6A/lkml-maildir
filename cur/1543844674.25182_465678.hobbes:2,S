I actually saw much bigger wins when I tested with an Athlon XP based compaq laptop
a year or so back. dynticks moved idle from being stuck at 21W to a sinusoidal
cycle in single watt increments between 22W->18W.  It would never stay in the
lower ranges for long because of timers firing all the time.
See

 for details.
There is much interest right now in fixing up various bits of userspace
to not do braindead things with timers/polling.  The gnome people
have recently come up with a timertop-esque hack (that goes a bit further)
for eg. See 
http://blogs.gnome.org/ryanl
 for details.
Arjan also recently did battle with a huge amount of really dumb userspace,
and dwmw2 has been tracking a bunch of these for OLPC:

Damn all these busy people making me feel inadequate :)
