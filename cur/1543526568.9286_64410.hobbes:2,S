FWIW, I just want to add plea favor of having some form of bootp support
in kernel.
It has saved me many times and it is hell of easier than initrd. I have
done initrd only one time when I wanted to net boot a laptop and I needed
pcmcia. However since nowdays pcmcia is in kernel, I probably would not
need it anymore.
Back in the past we had simple bootp support which was then
extened into IP Plug-n-Play. 
Perhaps' it is better just scale it down to old simple bootp support
intest of removing it.
