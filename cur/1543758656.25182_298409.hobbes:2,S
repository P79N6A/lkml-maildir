The Winchips never really sold that well, and stopped being produced
when IDT sold off Centaur.  It was a niche processor in 1997. In 2005,
I'll be surprised if there are that many of them still working.
Mine lost its magic smoke for no reason around ~2002.
If there are any of them still being used out there, I'd be even
more surprised if they're running 2.6.  Then again, there are
probably loonies out there running it on 386/486's. 8-)
