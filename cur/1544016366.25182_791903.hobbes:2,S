I did not say that it is your argument, i said it is _by_ your argument: 
i.e. it is a logical extension of your argument.
Exactly how is such a warning different from other warnings that the 
kernel already emits? For which people supposedly have to set up a serial 
console? (which they dont have to)
Answer: it is not different, and it is exactly as hard or easy to find as 
the other ones. I.e. why should this warning get a special treatment? I 
already told the kernel that i dont want a gzip ramfs image decompressor 
by turning off the (otherwise default-enabled) option. panic()ing on that 
decision, overriding my decision and escallating it into a non-working 
system is silly and a bug.
