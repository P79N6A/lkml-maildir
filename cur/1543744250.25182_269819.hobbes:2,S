hm, i still fail to see the "magic" part here. from a current tree i get:
- ---------------
$ bk set -n -d -r1.2000.5.107 -r1.2000.5.108 | bk -R prs -h \
- -d'<:P:@:HOST:>\n$each(:C:){\t(:C:)\n}\n' - | head -n5

  [PATCH] EDD: use EXTENDED READ command, add CONFIG_EDD_SKIP_MBR
  Some controller BIOSes have problems with the legacy int13 fn02 READ
  SECTORS command.  int13 fn42 EXTENDED READ is used in preference by most
- ---------------
which looks similiar to the next one, but with "bk changes" i get the
ChangeSet number again:
- ---------------
$ bk changes -r1.2000.5.108 | head -n5
ChangeSet@1.2000.5.108, 2004-10-20 08:36:22-07:00, Matt_Domsch@dell.com

...or was i supposed to alter your cmdline? i just copy'n'pasted it...
anyway, i've seen that i have a lot of "bk help" ahead of me, thanks for
the course, though ;)
greetings,
Christian.
