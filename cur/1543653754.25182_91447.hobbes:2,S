The P4 has 128byte L2 cache lines (2^7). The L1 apparently has smaller lines.
For practical reasons the L1_CACHE_BYTES defines should not be smaller than
the L2 line size - otherwise slab's cache colouring would not be very 
effective. In fact the symbol is a bit misnamed, it refers to all CPU caches.
So it needs to be 7.
