Doesn't matter.
If you have increased the page count, the page _will_ stay in the page
cache. So everybody who wants to see the page that was mapped, will see it
with no possibility of getting an alias.

If so, the programmer has shit for brains. That simple.

No. Because "pinning" is _stupid_.
Imagine having two threads that both do direct IO from overlapping pages.
YOU NEED TO COUNT THE PINNING.
A "lock" bit is useless, and anybody who uses a lock bit is stupid and
ends up having to serialize things for no good reason.
Instead, the Linux answer is to say: pinning is bad, pinning is stupid,
pinning is useless - so dont do it.
Instead, we have the notion of "I have a reference to this page, don't let
it go away". Sure, the page can be _unmapped_ (ie it is not pinned), but
WHO CARES?
Nobody.
