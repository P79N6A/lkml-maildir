The overall objection is to treating ext3 as a highly mutable, 
one-size-fits-all filesystem.
Maybe there is value in moving some reiser4 concepts -- a set of 
metadata+algorithm plugins -- to the VFS level.  I dunno.
But for ext3 specifically, it seems like bolting on extents, 48bit, 
delayed allocation, and other new features weren't really suited for the 
original ext2-style design.  Outside of the support (and marketing, 
because that's all version numbers are in the end) issues already 
mentioned, I think it falls into the nebulous realm of "taste."
Rather than taking another decade to slowly fix ext2 design decisions, 
why not move the process along a bit more rapidly?  Release early, 
release often...
