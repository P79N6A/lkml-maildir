This is why I get quite passionate about misinformation being spread.
Horst KNOWS what the benefits are but seems to cling to the notion
that because it is a minor change for the way he does things that
it is necessarily bad. He failed to mention what happens when we run
out of maj/mins, when you have
sda, sdb, and sdc, and you remove sdb... Whoops, sdc is sdb!!! Not
with devfs, it addresses devices by hardware address when applicable,
and provides symlinks to the oldstyle names like /dev/sdb.
I'm not going to go into how difficult PCMCIA, USB, et all is w/out
something as elegant as devfs.
Please see the devfs FAQ for the pros and cons. Richard Gooch is
VERY forthcoming. He was very sceintific in his approach to
designing and implementing his stuff.
