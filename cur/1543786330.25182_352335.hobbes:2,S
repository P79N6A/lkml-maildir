Thanks for your reply.
But I am looking for a tool or method to do stack backtrace
automatically, not debug manually.
The tool listed on 
http://www.aivosto.com/visustin.html
 can only
generate control flow from source code. But I need a control flow
generator that can generate control flow from binary codes. One
example is EEL (Executable Edit Library). But it only works for SPARC
machine, not PC. :(
As for the question about the kernel development list, I am developing
a kernel module that supports stack backtrace and can analyze user app
binaries to enforce security policies. So this is still related to
Kernel development. :)
