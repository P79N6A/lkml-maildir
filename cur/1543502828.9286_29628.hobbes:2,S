Nonsense.  When I do
    $ cmd | cmd2 | cmd3
and then hit ^C, I certainly do not want to kill one process, I want to 
kill all of them.  There is this age old concept called process groups 
which makes this work.  And process groups work just fine for killing a 
related group of cloned processes.

This is just silly beyond words.  The Linux model is _clearly_ the
superset of the LWP model.  Under Linux I can kill a specific thread
or all of the threads, using the same interfaces Unix has had since v6
or earlier.  Under the LWP model, I can kill all the LWPs.  I can't kill
a specific one.  And that's really a drag - maybe I want to use SIGUSR1
or SIGHUP to turn on debugging on a per thread basis.  Under Linux, that
just works, with no new code to be written, no new commands to be added,
no new model to be understood.

Err, umm, I guess I'd want to see a real world example of somebody wanting
to do this to really understand the need.  Until then, this sounds sort of
like a made up example to win an argument.

On Linux, it doesn't matter.  Use the right number of threads from the
beginning, the OS is more than capable of context switching them fast
enough on a 2 processor system.
: It is probably possible to implement this m-to-n model on top of clones,
But why would you want to?  The only reason is if your processes are 
so bloody slow that you must use threads.  Suppose for a moment that
process context switches and thread context switches both cost the
same, hell, let's say they both cost 0.  Then what possible reason
would there be to have user level threads?
