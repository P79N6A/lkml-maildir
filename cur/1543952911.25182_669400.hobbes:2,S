I'm running Fedora 8 (MythTV) using 2.6.24.3-34.fc8 and I'm getting a stack 
trace in the ivtv driver (not tainted!). My system was working fine under 
2.6.23.15-137.fc8. I'm enclosing the stack trace in ivtv. The exact system 
setup is
vmlinuz-2.6.24.3-34.fc8
ivtv-kmdl-2.6.24.3-34.fc8-1.0.3-136.fc8.i686.rpm (from ATRPMs)
Also, if I add the wifi drivers (which I know taints the kernel), I get the 
madwifi stack traces listed. This is using
madwifi-hal-kmdl-2.6.24.3-34.fc8-0.9.3.3-39.fc8.i686.rpm
madwifi-kmdl-2.6.24.3-34.fc8-0.9.3.3-39.fc8.i686.rpm
from ATRPMs. I realize this is a tainted kernel and I'm on my own, but 
hopefully someone has something insightful.
