Bugger, I was aware of this issue when I did the rewrite, but I
obviously forgot to come back and check it.  While doing the rewrite,
I looked at things carefully and couldn't see any reason that we need
to check against both r1 and PACAKSAVE.  We do certainly need to check
PACAKSAVE *instead* of r1, though - I thought I'd done that, but
obviously forgot to fix it up in the final patch.
Anton, can you get the SFS guys to check with the patch below.  It
reverts your patch, but then replaces the old check against r1 with a
check against PACAKSAVE - assuming I haven't missed some corner case,
I think this is a better fix.
David.
