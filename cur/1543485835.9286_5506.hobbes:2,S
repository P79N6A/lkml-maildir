    Umm... Do we have a filesystem that would return EEXIST instead of ENOENT?
You mean `instead of ENOTEMPTY'?
That is irrelevant. POSIX describes that the system call can return
these two values in this case. An application program must be ready
to handle both error return values, even if Linux today uses only one
of them.
    I've looked through the rename(2) manpage again and found several
    inaccuracies:
    |       If newpath exists but the operation fails for some  reason
    |       or  the  system  crashes  rename  guarantees  to  leave an
    |       instance of newpath in place.
    +++Notice that currently for some filesystems crash may lead to the
    +++situation when the link disappears. Example: VFAT.
Removed the `or the system crashes' part. That was a very optimistic
author, who wanted to guarantee things even in case of a crash.
The rest of the sentence is a POSIX requirement.
    |       EBUSY   newpath  exists  and is the current working direc-
    |               tory or root directory of some process.
    +++Or is opened by some process. Or if the source is mountpoint

    +++(if it exists, indeed).
New text:
       EBUSY  The rename fails because oldpath or  newpath  is  a
              directory  that  is in use by some process (perhaps
              as current working directory, or as root directory,
              or because it was open for reading) or is in use by
              the system (for example as mount point), while  the
              system  considers  this an error.  (Note that there
              is no requirement to return EBUSY in such  cases  -
              there is nothing wrong with doing the rename anyway
              - but it is allowed to return EBUSY if  the  system
              cannot otherwise handle such situations.)

    |               or oldpath was a directory and did not allow write
    |               permission (needed to update the ..  entry).
    +++IMHO it needs a clarification. First of all, until now

I don't think so. Think of ancient UNIX. A directory is just a file
containing file names. If you want to change a name, then you have
to have write permission to the directory.

New text:
       ENOTDIR
              A  component used as a directory in oldpath or new­
              path is not, in fact, a directory.  Or, oldpath  is
              a directory, and newpath exists but is not a direc­
              tory.
[A nice collection of +++ items you have. A test for bad modems?]
    Rename:
    *We should be able to lookup the source and target.
    *We should be able to remove the source (link).
    *If the target exists we should be able to remove it.
    *If the target doesn't exist we should be able to create a link in
    target's parent.
    *If the target exists and is not a directory source also should be
    not a directory, otherwise - EISDIR.
    *If the target exists and is a directory source also should be a
    directory, otherwise - ENOTDIR.
    *If both links point to the same file we succeed. (Ouch... so we
    should move this check up...)
    *Both source and target must be on the same filesystem, otherwise -
    EXDEV.
    *If source and target have different parents and source is a
    directory we must have write permissions on it, otherwise -
    EACCES.
    (Question: what about execute permissions?)
As mentioned already, we need write permission as soon as we change
a name in a directory. We need execute (search) permission in all
directories involved, including the final ones where we'll write.
    *If the move would make the source its own subdirectory - EINVAL.
    *If the rename() is not supported by the filesystem - EPERM.
    *If the target is somebody's root or pwd or is opened by some
    process - EBUSY.
This is allowed, but not encouraged. Clearly a system without such
restrictions is much more useful.
    *If the target is not empty - ENOTEMPTY (there is a borderline
    case, if the target is not empty and somebody opened a file in
    (under) it we return EBUSY).
ENOTEMPTY is preferable. A good system would not use EBUSY at all.
    *Any checks applied by filesystem (EMLINK, EIO, EDEADLOCK (yup.
    UMSDOS...))
