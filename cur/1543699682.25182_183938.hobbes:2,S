Are you using netfilter? There is a known netfilter hang problem.
What workload you have on the production boxes? (what is running, etc)
Can you show us a complete hardware list, /proc/interrupts output, 
.config and dmesg?
Trying to reproduce the oops on the development boxes with NMI watchdog 
turned on might also help a lot.
