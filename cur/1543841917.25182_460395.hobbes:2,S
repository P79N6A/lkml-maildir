I think that clinches it. If WinXP sends the 6-byte version, we should 
too, since that's effectively what pretty much everybody has tested with 
(yeah, Apple used to be the main firewire user, but I bet there have been 
more XP users over the last few years, it's not like it's unusual on PC's 
any more).

Yeah, please send me a patch asap after 2.6.18, so that it can go in very 
early (regardless of anything else).
Btw, somebody should tell the Oracle Endpoint people to get their target 
client to support the 6-byte version too, no? Anybody who knows that team?
