Look at MAINTAINERS in your kernel source tree, after a quick look I got:
8250/16?50 (AND CLONE UARTS) SERIAL DRIVER
P:      Theodore Ts'o
M:      tytso@mit.edu
L:      linux-serial@vger.kernel.org
W:      
http://serial.sourceforge.net
S:      Maintained
But you can also send the patch here if its small, for peer review.
