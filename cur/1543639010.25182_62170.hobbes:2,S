Ok, right, I was indeed talking about ranges that have been disabled
by the firmware.

Well, it's definitely not that specific since I know several host
bridges that have several programmable windows to PCI, and those
aren't PPC specifc. In the case of pmacs, the UniNorth bridge
forwards up to 7 regions of 256Mb (0x80000000..0x8fffffff,
0x90000000..0x9fffffff, etc... up to 0xe0000000..0xefffffff),
each of them beeing selected by a bit setup by the firmware.
It then have additional 16 regions of type 0xfx000000 than can
also be individually selected, some of them beeing reserved for
IO and config space, but one of them beeing typically an additional
memory window to the PCI bus.

Yes, well ... ;)

Ok, here we need Linus answert. We did have a patch in the PPC tree
that was consideing closed resources as really closed instead of
transparent, and we were told by Linus that there were non standard
bridges and various issues in the x86 world with that, and that those
would remain transparent. I don't have pointers at hand, but I think
this was dicusssed on lkml several monthes ago.
I would _love_ beeing able to simplify even more my code by assuming
that the resources are closed (what I really need in most of my
cases), or the bridge fully transparent, according to such a bit.

Well, I do have a case of conflict here where a device below a bridge
can't get it's resources allocated because it's considered as conflicting
with the bridge itself. The problem disappear if I set the bridge
as closed (thoough I get another problem where the IO region is not
enabled by the firmware, but that's another matter, I can quirk here).
In most cases, I have to trust the firmware setup as a critical ASIC
(the "mac-io" ASIC) tend to be behind a PCI<->PCI bridge and I cannot
afford to have access to it disabled nor moved at any time.
This is btw a problem with the current kernel code as the PCI probe
code will disable IO/MEM forwarding during probe on the bridge. That
means there is a small window of time during which, if I take an
interrupt for example, I'll be dead because my interrupt controller
(which is part of that "mac-io" ASIC) will be unreachable. But this
is a different issue.

I'd set all 4 then, thus the bridge would really be seen as forwarding
all the regions of the host bridge, whatever they are.
Since pci_read_bridge_bases() is called by the arch code, I can implement
a version doing what you suggest in the arch code and use that. I'll
try and let you know.

That makes sense. This would also allow to spot that there is no device
below a PCI<->PCI bridge when doing that assignement of unassigned
resources, and thus to spot that the firmware may have indeed been
right to close them and not to bother.

Ok, I'll look into implementing that in the PPC arch code for now
Thanks for your comments,
