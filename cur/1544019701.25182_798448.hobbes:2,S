Oops.  Here they are.  The order is:
x86-unify-io.h-virt-phys.patch
x86-unify-io.h-ioremap-proto.patch
    J
Subject: x86: asm/io.h: unify virt_to_phys/phys_to_virt
Impact: unify identical code
asm/io_32.h and _64.h has functionally identical definitions for
virt_to_phys, phys_to_virt, page_to_phys, and the isa_* variants, so
just unify them.
The only slightly functional change is using phys_addr_t for the
physical address argument and return val.

 Subject: x86: asm/io.h: unify ioremap prototypes
Impact: unify identical code
asm/io_32.h and _64.h have identical prototypes for the ioremap family
of functions.  The 32-bit header had a more descriptive comment.
