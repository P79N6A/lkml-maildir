It's not a matter of "won't happen" so much as "not a damn thing we can
do when it does". There's very little point in having this sort of code
in a mass-market camera, phone, DVR, TV, etc. (of which there are
already millions running Linux). These devices have no console and
basically zero serviceability beyond firmware upgrades. If taking these
vestigial debugging features out means we can cram in more features that
consumers can actually see and will pay for, that's precisely what's
going to happen.
