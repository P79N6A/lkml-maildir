Definitely. Lockmeter isn't terribly Linux-ish from my examination of
that patch a while back. Doing it against lockdep is definitely the
right thing to do in that it unifies lock handling through initializer
keys that lockmeter doesn't, from my memory.
The spin time tracking can be put into the slow path of the spin, like
what peter has now, so that it has minimal impact against the uncontended
case. Updating the times would then be a trivial pointer dereference
plus add and hopefully won't have instrumentation side effects against
the rest of the locking behavior in the system.
