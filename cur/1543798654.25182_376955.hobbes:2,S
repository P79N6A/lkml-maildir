cmd shouldn't be a module of it's own (see patch just sent), and the
same is true of this module.  Functionality that doesn't have it's own
fundamental objects to operate on should be separate modules.  If you
use modules ala dlopen()ed .so libraries in userspace you will always
get code that's a piece of junk and full of bugs.
