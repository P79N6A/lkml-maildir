I don't think it's that different. The Cell SPU scheduler is also
implemented in kernel space. Every application using an SPU program
has its own contexts in spufs and doesn't look at the others.
While we don't have it yet, we're thinking about adding a sputop
or something similar that shows the utilization of spus. You don't
need that one, since get exactly that with the regular top, but you
might want to have a tool that prints statistics about how often
your guests drop out of the virtualisation mode, or the number
of interrupts delivered to them.

What is the point of 32 bit hosts anyway? Isn't this only available
on x86_64 type CPUs in the first place?
