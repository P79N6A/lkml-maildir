Hi,
A request for help & a question:
-- There are once again rumours circulating that IBM is woking 
on a mainframe port.  (see e.g. 
http://linuxtoday.com/stories/11028.html
)
Has anyone actually seen this?  The only IBM'ers active on the 
egcs/gcc/binutils mailing lists are not involved in this port,  so I'm 
trying to determine if this is a marketing group in IBM leaking this 
info, or if there is actually an executive backer in this.   I'm 
inquiring purely out of, ahem, 'enlightened self-interest' (I know
this sounds crass, but it would be fun to turn a hobby into a job).
-- Patches. The current mainframe port at 
http://linas.org/linux/i370.html
 
is against linux v2.2.1 (that was the latest when the port was started).
Should I squeeze to get a patch out for 2.3.x (thereby hopefully making it 
into 2.4.0) or should I just let it slide and patch 2.4.x?  I'm concerned
about missing some 'window of opportunity' and then waiting for 2.5.x to 
roll around ...  does it matter?  Anyone care?  I want to minimize hassle
to Torvalds & co. by sending patches that are not too big/small/numerous
for the occasion.  (Of course, my personal preference is numerous small 
patches, as its a hassle to maintain a large patch.  But I'm not sure how 
things are done round here).
