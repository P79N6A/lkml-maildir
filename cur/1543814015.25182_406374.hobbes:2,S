great!
I forgot to announce Thomas' great new rt-tester framework, which allows 
easy testing of the kernel's PI implementation, via userspace scripts.
You can enable it via CONFIG_RT_MUTEX_TESTER, and the userspace scripts
are at:
 
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/realtime-preempt/testing/rt-tester.tar.bz2
Thomas' testing method has the advantage that it utilizes the kernel's 
PI mechanism directly, hence it is easy to keep it uptodate without 
having to port the kernel's PI code to userspace. We should add the 
testcases for the bugs you just found.

thanks, applied. [NOTE: had to apply it by hand because the patch was 
whitespace damaged, it had all tabs converted to spaces.]

well, this is a circular dependency deadlock - which is illegal in the 
kernel, and which we detect for futex locks too - so it shouldnt happen.  
Or did you see it happen for real?
