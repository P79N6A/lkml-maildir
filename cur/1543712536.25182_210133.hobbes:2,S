Same here (duron 1.2GHz, 512MB ram, IDE disks (via and promise controllers)) 
and it doesn't matter if I'm using cryptoloop or dm-crypt. 
System hangs for about one seconds (xmms stops playing, xterms are not 
responding to key presses) and then everything back to normal until next hang 
happens (in few seconds).
