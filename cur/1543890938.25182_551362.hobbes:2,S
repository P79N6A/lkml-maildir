Interesting.  I'd expect that the calling process is spinning, with realtime
policy and is expecting some other process to do something (ie: run a workqueue).
If you keep the process and irq affinities, and disable the realtime policy
does that also prevent the problem?
It would be interesting it you could capture a few task traces while it is stuck:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq then do ALT-SYSRQ-P a bunch of times and ALT-SYSRQ-T,
see if you can work out where the CPU is stuck.
ALso, 2.6.22-rc3 might have accidentally fixed this.
