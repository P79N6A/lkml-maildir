Subject: User-mode Linux ported to ppc

User-mode Linux is now booting on PPC Linux - it can boot with a
Debian root floppy image with init=/bin/sh and poke around.  It mostly
works, although there are still a few problems.
The current patch is available from
http://www.tartarus.org/~chris/user-mode-linux/,
 made against recent
UML CVS (see 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
).
Cheers,
Chris
