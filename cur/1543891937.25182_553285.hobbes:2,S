And now all that's done, how about yet another random person stepping in and 
suggesting NIL or maybe NIL_PTR instead of ZERO_SIZE_PTR?
I understand the idea is that code need not necesarily care about zero sized 
allocation meaning it won't (generally) need to spell it out but it's still a 
dreadful name... :-(
