Thanks, an equivalent patch is alredy merged in acpi-test, and waiting a
push to linus.
BTW: this is an ACK if you want to merge this patch ahead of the stuff in
acpi-test.

Take a look on the experimental ACPI bay and dock support in acpi-test, it
is even better than ibm-acpi's builtin support... and in fact, deprecates
it.
