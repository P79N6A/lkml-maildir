I do not propose returning to this situation.

If this is seen as a problem, it should be fixed in the virtual
terminal system. /dev/console and TIOCCONS exist and work in many
Unices, not just Linux.

And how did Sun fix it? They fixed it by restricting TIOCCONS to users
who have read access to the console - more liberal than my proposal!

I use machines that I don't administer, and on all of them for the
last 15 years until the recent breakage, "xterm -C" worked.

Exactly. I have an array of programs that write to /dev/console in the
expectation that the message will be read by the person sitting at the
console.

As I have indicated, there is a world outside your experience of
Linux. As well as my own scripts, the machines one which I work are
set up to have syslog write urgent messages to /dev/console.

I do not administer the machines. If you hadn't broken TIOCCONS,
everything would still work.

Which is not available.
