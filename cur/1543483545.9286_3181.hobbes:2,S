Seeing a single oops multiple times during a single kernel boot does not
necessarily point to a fault in that code.  The particular error you are
seeing in find_candidate really indicates a buffer_head list corruption,
and those are almost always associated with hardware problems either in
the memory or cache.

Dump is a very heavy user of the buffer cache.
