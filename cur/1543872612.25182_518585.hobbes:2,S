Thanks. Darn the debugging didn't catch anything. Did you see any BUG during 
the boot earlier than that screenshot? Probably not. 
If you have the time I would appreciate you testing 2.6.20 with the rsdl 0.28 
patch for it with a config as close to this -mm2 one as possible.
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/staircase-deadline/2.6.20-sched-rsdl-0.28.patch
and see if the bug recurs please?
Thanks!
