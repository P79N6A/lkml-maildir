I didn't know that.  [If that is the case, I wonder what Nigel means by
the "whole memory image".  Nigel?]

Generally speaking, my perception is that suspend2 may be preferrable below
256 MB of RAM.  Moreover there are some people who seem to prefer
entirely kernel-based suspend, and I'm not going to develop the code
in swap.c and disk.c any further (of course with the exception of bugfixes
etc.).  Nigel has done it already so perhaps there is a room for his code,
too, _provided_ _that_ it is accepted.
Greetings,
Rafael
