Exactly, just like with the "Internet companies". Nowadays the easiest
way to boost an otherwise valueless IPO is to append ".com" to your
name. In this market segment, stock prices are made up of pure fantasy.
This always happens when speculators listening to the buzzword press
take over the stock exchange from investors looking at balance sheets.
