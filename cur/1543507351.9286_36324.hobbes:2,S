just in case anyone misunderstood the above result (as i think many did). 
The 'CPU load' mentioned above is a _realtime process_ (unless Benno you
changed the benchmark). This is a _good_ result.  'increase CPU load'
simply means 'generate more RT load' - which in _this case_ might mean
less disk performance - but the RT task asked for it in the first place.
All in one: i can see no problem here.
if a 'simple' CPU-user (non-RT) is getting more active there is no
slowdown.
