Well thinking about this :-)  The way that this needs to be implemented is
by passing to do_something the flags to use in kmalloc, which is done in
the kernel when needing to call something that allocates when different
flags can be used. So a kmalloc_auto would only save on passing flags in
parameters, which can sometimes get annoying.
