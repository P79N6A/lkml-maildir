A similar thing could be done for sending the email;
Look for known email clients - like mutt, pine, elm, check they exist
and are executable, then check if sendmail is available.  Present the
user with a list of the email clients found (and sendmail, if found
and local MTA process is running) and then ask them to pick their
prefered email client/sending method from the list.
