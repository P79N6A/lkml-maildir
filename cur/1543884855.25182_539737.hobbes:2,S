Yeah, to quote the code in drivers/lguest/lguest_bus.c:
/* At the moment we build all the drivers into the kernel because they're so

I do that all the time, too.  The main issue is that we provide no ABI
for lguest (at least, not yet), so if you actually change guest/host
kernel version, you're on your own...
Thanks!
Rusty.
