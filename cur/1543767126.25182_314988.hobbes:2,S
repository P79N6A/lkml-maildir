Ok, it solves my issue, but:
. desabling it through 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space' is not
  a solution because only the application knows that it wants it to be desabled,
  and the application is not root so cannot write to /proc; morever the
  application can only speak for itself so desabling should be on a per process
  bias.
  I can hardly imagine to publish a warning in the README such as:
  This software only works if your Linux kernel is configured so that
  /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space = 0
. second, my process restart succeeding roughly in 50% cases means that the
  randomisation performed is just a toy. A virus assuming fixed memory layout
  will still succeed 50% of times to install.
All in all, I'm not concerned about Linux kernel to randomise or not,
but I need to have a reliable way to request a memory region and be granted
that I can request the same one in a futur run.
What is the proper way to get such a memory area ?
