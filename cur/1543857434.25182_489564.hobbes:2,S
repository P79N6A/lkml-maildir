Subject: [PATCH] efi is_memory_available ia64 hack build fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
The addition of an is_available_memory() routine to some arch i386
code, along with an extern for it in efi.h, caused the ia64 build
to fail, which has the apparently identical routine, marked 'static'.
The ia64 build fails with:
arch/ia64/kernel/efi.c:229: error: static declaration of 'is_available_memory' follows non-static declaration
include/linux/efi.h:305: error: previous declaration of 'is_available_memory' was here              
Removing the static modifier from the ia64 definition of this
routine lets it build.
But it still doesn't seem right - as now we have two apparently
identical copies of is_available_memory() defined, in:
  arch/i386/kernel/efi.c
  arch/ia64/kernel/efi.c
However, I don't know what to do about that.
At least the build gets past this point now.
