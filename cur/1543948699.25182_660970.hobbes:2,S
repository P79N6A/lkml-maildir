We could change the interface to return just a pfn (which is aligned to
the pshift returned), as it was before. That would free up some bits
that we could reserve for future use.

Having a union of bitfields is allowed, but having a union in a
struct of bitfields or vice-versa will probably cause the compiler not
to put all of this together in a single 64 bit entity.
This whole swap thing still needs some thought. The swap file offset
can take 59 bits, so there is a possibilty that this will break once
someone uses a really huge swap file. I doubt that this will happen, but
that doesn't mean it can't happen. Maybe there should be some completely
different interface for the swap stuff, like /proc/pid/swapmap or
something like that.

Well, if some powerpc guy would implement pmd_huge() and pmd_pfn() for
powerpc, the x86 specific pmd_to_ppte() won't be that x86 specific no
more. I didn't know there were huge pmds on powerpc, as pmd_huge() is
defined as zero for everything but x86.
Does it have huge puds as well? Once we support 1G pages for x86 a new
function has to be added to this file to handle that special case, too.

Good point.

This is the place where those architectures that define the page size in
the pte should test for a huge page and put the correct page size in the
pshift field. I looked at some of them and did not find a function or a
macro to do this test, no generic one and no arch-dependent one.

As I said above, we could just use a raw pfn as the interface did
before.

The standard says the ordering of bitfields is "implementation defined".
I'm currently unsure whether this means the implementation of a machine
or of the compiler. In the latter case, using a different compiler for
a user space program than the one that was used to compile the kernel
could create problems.

If you got an idea where to put it, speak up. I thought asm/pgtable.h
would be the right place, but maybe we should put all this in
linux/pagemap_ppte.h (or whatever it will eventually be called, or
wherever this stuff will eventually end up) and put a nasty #ifdef
CONFIG_X86 around it.

AFAIK this pmd stuff is a special case for x86, at least for huge pages
that are used by user programs. Other architectures encode the page size
in the pte, but I don't have the time to learn how exactly this is done
there and write up code that will work for another 4 or 5 platforms.
Those who are responsible for the memory management on the other archs
should come up with a mechanism to find out whether a pte is for a huge
page or not. Adding code to use that would be fairly trivial, then.

That might be good idea.
