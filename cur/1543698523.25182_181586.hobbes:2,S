Note how zisofs only has to handle the read-only case. cramfs does the
same.
Reading is trivially done by having a few extra buffers (either through
the buffer cache or explicit buffering).
Writing is the more interesting case. I don't know how well NTFS does in
low-memory circumstances.
(Which is by no means to say that it is somehow impossible to get right:
you just have to be careful).
