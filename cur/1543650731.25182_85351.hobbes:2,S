Will whoever committed code that simply deleted the error handling from
ncr53c8xxx, sym53c8xx and inia100 please put it back or at least add a 
#warning "Don't use this driver"
SCSI with no error handling is asking for corruption and not warning
users about this as we try and stabilize the kernel is a very very bad
idea. If it warns or doesnt compile then it can get fixed properly. If
it doesnt warn it may get missed with catastrophic results
