That would be great - are you volunteering? ;-)  Seriously - I might be
able to look at what ramfs does and port that to tmpfs for my needs, but
that's about the extent of my kernel hacking skills.  For now, mount
--bind looks like it'll work just fine.  If somebody wants to fix tmpfs,
I'll be happy to test patches; it'll just change a couple of lines in my
package loading logic (mount --bind x y -> ln -s x y).
What I'm not sure of is which solution is actually 'better' - I'm
guessing that performance-wise, neither will make a noticable
difference, so I guess memory usage would be the deciding factor.  If I
can get a lot closer to the size of a symlink (10-20 bytes) that would
be best.  The issue with /proc/mounts really shouldn't hurt anything - I
could almost get by without mounting /proc anyway, it's mainly a
convenience.
