We *desperately* need either more plugin-like "plugins" or a FUSE-like
way of writing plugins.  I mean, tar is small enough, but I don't want
you chipping away at my (soon-to-be) 2 gigs of desktop RAM -- I need
that for Doom 3!
Or, do you mean using the RAM for keeping the working copy of the
zipfile?  And here I was trying to establish that it was better to cache
this.  If the cache appears as a separate Reiser tree, it's not much
different than keeping it in RAM anyway, but it can be flushed if I need
the space for... work... ;)
