Yeah, xfsdumps not a bad idea, the interfaces it uses may well
be able to avoid the cases that trigger shutdown.  Otherwise it
is a case of identifying the problem directory inode (the inum
is reported in the shutdown trace) and avoiding that path when
cp'ing - you can match inum to path via xfs_ncheck.

Thanks for the kind words, they're much appreciated at times
like these. :-]
