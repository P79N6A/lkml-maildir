Hi Folks,
   On an I2000 there's a PIIX5 IDE controller and a pci bridge that
identifies as a 450NX rev 5.  This causes the ide driver to attempt to
disable DMA, to work around a limitation in the old 450NX chipset.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work, and on boot I see these messages:
piix: 450NX errata present, disabling IDE DMA.
piix: A BIOS update may resolve this.
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00alpha2
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
PIIX4: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:03.1
PCI: Found IRQ 0 for device 0000:00:03.1
PIIX4: chipset revision 1
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later

hdc:<4>hdc: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
hdc: DMA timeout error
If I boot with ide1=nodma things work.
It's currently broken to try to unconfigure IDE DMA with kconfig.
Note that:
     1. The PIIX5 at is not on the same PCI bus as the 450NX PXB.
     From lspci:
     00:03.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82372FB PIIX5 IDE (rev 01)
     04:10.1 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 450NX - 82454NX/84460GX PCI Expander
     Bridge (rev 05)
     2.  As far as I can tell from Intel's website, the device that
     identifies as a 450NX is actually part of the 460GX chipset; and it's
     only rev 0 through 3 that have the problem (the `real' 450NX
chips) (although I could easily be wrong there; it's hard to work out
what the PCI revision field corresponds to in Intel's stepping chart.
The bug is in steppings A0, B0 and C0.)
