What is the best way to install the modules? Is there a directory _all_ of
the modules exist in b4 you do "make modules_install". I usually end up
setting EXTRAVERSION to something unique and doing a make modules_install.
That way it does not hose up the modules for the build machine.
Is there a better way?
I found it puts the new ones in a unique directory under /lib/modules.  I
just copied that also.  
I didn't go into the issues, but I am getting an error message from the
target box that "/dev/md0 must be a nonpersistent RAID0 or LINEAR array!"
This is OK in 2.2.17, which is currently running on the machine.
