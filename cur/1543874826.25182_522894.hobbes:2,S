Sure.  I'm really irked that I lost most of my collection of posted
exploits.  I prefer to test with the same widget the poster tested
with.  
(in this particular case, it's not _very_ important which one i test
with, i'm exploring my RSDL troubles with sleepers in general...
duration matters though, need to be fairly short/short burn.)
