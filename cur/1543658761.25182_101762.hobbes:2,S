There simply aren't enough scenarios for this to be a mystery. Both
-aa and 2.5.x should have something in there for it: memclass-related
buffer_head stuff in -aa, and bh-stripping + "bh-less" operation (for
ext2) in 2.5.x + fewer (if any) bh's outside of actual dirty data.
Bloat monitoring scripts attached, which might provide somewhat more
useful output to capture, though they certainly don't eliminate the
need for /proc/meminfo logging. I'll also see if some of the accounting
patches can be backported and send those to Marcelo and Andrea.
