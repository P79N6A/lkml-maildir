hm, OK, so it lines up with what scripts/kallsyms.c presently does.
But it all strikes me as a bit fragile and grotty.  Perhaps longer-term it
would be better if scripts/kallsyms.c were to also emit a header file which
declares all the things which that program emits the definitions of, no?
I guess that means that we'd need to run the program twice - once at the
start of compilation in generate-the-header-file mode and once at the end
of compilation in generate-the-symbols mode.
Or something like that.
