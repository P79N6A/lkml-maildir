Hello all,
I am seeing something odd w/sockets.  I have an app
that opens and closes network sockets.  When the app
terminates it releases all fd (sockets) and exists,
yet running netstat after the app terminates still
shows the sockets as open!  Am I doing something wrong
or is this something that is normal?
TIA!
Phy
