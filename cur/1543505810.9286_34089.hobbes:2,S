I have just experienced the same problem with 2.2.11-pre7: For the first
time in ages, I saw a _crashed_ Linux box :-((
After some days of operation (the server is not very busy), all
processes reported "out of memory" problems and a cold reboot was the
only option :-(
I see that "Ronald Moesbergen" <ronald.moesbergen@bkvision.nl> reported
the same kind of problem in his message with subject "PROBLEM: Out of
memory lock-up with kernel 2.2.11".
Hard'n'soft description:
Uni-processor Pentium II on a ASUS BX motherboard, 128MB of RAM. Symbios
8751sp (non-OEM) SCSI controller. 3com 905 NIC in 10mbit mode.
Kernel .config available at 
http://www.fsr.ku.dk/people/troels/crash/
Distribution: Red Hat 6, with many packages from Red Hat's "Rawhide"
'distribution' (including the glibc 2.1.2 package).
I'm sorry that I can't be more specific WRT debugging messages. But
something scary is certainly going on.
