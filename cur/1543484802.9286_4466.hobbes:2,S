Personally I like that the kernel works fine even without update. I see
update only as a `if you don't run it and you have a crash don't blame
us for the fs damage'.

I was asking for such experiment _only_ for know if I understood right how
the inode syncing/freeing works.
My _real_ point is that with my ad-hoc proggy I am able to leak also
2.2.2-pre2 with update running. 5 sec (or more) is ethernity for a
malicious proggy. 
Here when all inodes are busy the machine survive fine, just tried (I see
my message inode-max limit reached every time the allocation fails). Are
you sure that in 2.0.x you was syncing back the dirty list as I do now,
before failing to free the inodes on the inuse-list? 
I can see though why you wanted to avoid failing in opening inodes. I
think we could allow the root user to go throught allocating inodes.
Should be a trivial implementation: 
	if (!capable of something)
		return NULL;
Do you agree?
