Swapping boards around on the PCI bus helps on some motherboards. Also
turn off PNP in the BIOS. This makes things cleaner when Linux gets
control. The ASUS P2B-DS is one that has the problem. At one time I
found that everything was on IRQ12. Turning OFF PNP made some boards
look like they were on IRQ9 (phony, it's the cascade for the old
controller). Moving a few boards around got them all onto separate
IRQs.
