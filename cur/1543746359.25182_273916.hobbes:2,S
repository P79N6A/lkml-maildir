There are some pretty scary macros like:
MIN(a, b) (a < b) ? a:b  You can throw any parentheses you want
around and it doesn't make it correct for selecting the lowest value
of the amount to read/write from a buffer. The a and b need to be cast
to unsigned before the comparison is made --and then some compilers
will (correctly, I'm told) compain about range.
