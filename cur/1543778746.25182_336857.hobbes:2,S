Okay. I'm sorry but I'm not very clear with this. I'm just putting
down here my understanding. So basically we have two mutually
EXCLUSIVE hotplug drivers I can use for PCI Express:
1) "pciehp.ko" : We use this PCIE HP driver when our BIOS supports
Native Hot-plug for PCI Express (which means that hot-plug will be
handled by OS single handedly).
2) "acpiphp.ko" : We use this "generic" ACPI HP driver when BIOS
allows only ITSELF to handle hot-plug events.
Is my understanding correct? I would appreciate if you could help me
gain a grip on this.
Thanks a lot for the useful info you gave. Provided me with a new
direction to work on.
Regards,
Rajat
