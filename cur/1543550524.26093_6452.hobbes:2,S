Jeff,
I went to slashdot.org to read the story.
There was a historical referrence, in the beginning, that implies that I
was accussing Microsoft of using Linux code.  The reality was that I
offered to help them with the solution I was working on because of the
huge mess that the great taskfile debate brought out.
People were pointing out that because I was exposing how to abuse it in
the kernel and that a policy of preventing harmfal combinations was not
acceptable.  Since this information could/would/did spill over to the
script kiddies, I thought it was the better part of valor (sp) to inform
an aquaintance at Microsoft of the potential problem that they could see.
Only because I respect that person (at MS) did I even consider discussing
the issue.
If they want to take a jesture of kindness and twist it to imply I am
blackmailing them, Bill's view of the world is very sinical (sp).
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
