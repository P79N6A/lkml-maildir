Matt Domsch of Dell has been working very hard getting the IPMI driver
working well on Dell machines, and I've been working on converting the
IPMI driver over to use refcounts without using macros of death.  This
is a set of patches destined for 2.6.15, if they are ok.
Patches included are:
ipmi-use-refcounts.patch - The big one, convert over to refcounts
ipmi-various-si-cleanups.patch - Lots of little cleanups from Matt
ipmi-watchdog-parm-in-sysfs.patch - Parms in sysfs are nice
ipmi-poweroff-cleanups.patch - Fix stupid mistakes on my part
ipmi-more-dell-fixes.patch - Fixes for handling some firmware issues
ipmi-si-start-transaction-hook.patch - Hooks for handling firmware bugs
	and some hacks for some Dell machines.
ipmi-bt-restart-reset-fixes.patch - Fix an error recovery case in BT
ipmi-kcs-error0-delay.patch - Fix an error recovery case in KCS
ipmi-timer-thread.patch - A thread to make IPMI run faster on average.
