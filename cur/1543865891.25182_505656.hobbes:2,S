That would be useful for both select and depend, as many have pointed
out.  And ignoring the fairly subjective "be nice" part, either select
or depend can completely get removed once the tools have it.
What I disagree with is the *trivially* part.  For one, the problem is
known for some time and has annoyed enough people, yet we don't have
patches yet.  Secondly, we'd need patches for most, if not all tools.
Not having used "xconfig" for the last eight years, I doubt that you'd
reach a majority of users with any of the plethora of make *config
targets.
We _need_ this support and I welcome anyone getting his/her hands dirty
writing it up.
