tulip drivers always cause trouble, sigh!
There have been three drivers evaluated with two different cards (and having
the feedback from the customers ...), before shipping SuSE6.2
Here are the sad results:
                                old 2114x            new 21143
tulip.c:v0.89H 5/23/98    starts dropping packets   not detected
                              after a while
tulip.c:v0.90 10/20/98             OK               not detected
tulip.c:v0.91e 5/27/99    hanging on detection           OK
So we shipped 0.90 and 0.91e ("tulip-new"). Not exactly what we like to do.
If sb. is gonna fix this: I don't remember details about the NIC's versions,
but I could find out.
