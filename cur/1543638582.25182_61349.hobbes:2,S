yes, doesn't work either.
I am currently trying to find a kernel, which supports wifi, floppy,apm.
As you can see in my header I downgraded to 2.5.24 right now, but floppy
is broken herein, too.
Now I am trying 2.5.20, perhaps this works ...
I am still hoping that in 2.5.31/32 floppy and apm will work again.
