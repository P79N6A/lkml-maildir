Please don't do this.  $reply_to ||= $message_id is OK but
having each patch as a reply to the previous one is
annoying.  I think it was Greg who recently posted one set
of patches that was so large the indentation for the thread
went off the screen.
       [PATCH 0/n] frob the niggle
       |-> [PATCH 1/n] frob the niggle

Other than that, thanks. If more people posted patch sets
like this it would be much nicer.
