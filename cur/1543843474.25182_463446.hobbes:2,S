Another interesting idea would be the addition to gcc of a:
__builtin_trace_point(char *name, ...)
It would output a function call sized NOP at it's call site, and store
in another section the trace point name, location, and (this is the
important part) a series of DWARF expressions to reconstruct the trace
point's argument list from the stack frame and saved registers.
This would completely eliminate the argument passing overhead of a
patched-out function call in the cases where the trace point takes
arguments.
It'd also make your __trace function attribute unnecessary, because gcc
could presumably figure out that the trace point is at the beginning of
the function.
It "only" requires compiler support on every architecture that the
kernel cares about and compiler upgrades for everyone who wants to use
static trace points, which is no mean feat.

rejecting mail from me and/or Comcast. If the first attempts actually
make it through and this is yet another duplicate, sorry.)
