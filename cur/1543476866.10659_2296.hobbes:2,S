It has worked for me... I complained about several problems, posted a patch
for another. They got fixed, and now 2.2.0-pre6 compiled fine and works for
me (i586/UP, binutils-2.9.1.0.19a)

Try Alan Cox, he has been quite receptive to egcs-related fixes. He fed
them to Linus, who eventually took them up.
If (1) isn't resolved (==> more testing under more situations), (3) won't
ever happen. (2) seems to be a thing of the past.
