This seems to be more userspace related than kernel related, so this is 
probably the wrong mailing list. Anyway, check that:
  - busybox is statically linked or that you have the necessary 
libraries in the library path. (you can check this with "ldd busybox")
  - busybox is marked executable
  - busybox is compiled for the right processor
  - check that the init= parameter points to the right executable
  - if you have another ppc machine, try a "chroot <dir> busybox" and 
see if it executes or why it doesn't
I hope this helps,
