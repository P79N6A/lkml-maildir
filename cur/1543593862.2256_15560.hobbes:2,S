Indeed.  However, I don't believe user space should _rely_ on the flag.
The reason is that there are network cards out there where the only way
to get the link status _is_ to transmit a packet, even on 10baseT.
PCNET is one example - the "oh my god my link is down" status bit is in
the transmit ring headers, not in an easily accessible register.
The only interpretation user space can place on IFF_RUNNING for these
cards is that if its not set, packets will get dropped by the interface.
If its set, packets _may_ be dropped by the interface.
[note I've not found anything in 2.4.5 where netif_carrier_ok prevents
the net layers queueing packets for an interface, and forwarding them
on for transmission].
