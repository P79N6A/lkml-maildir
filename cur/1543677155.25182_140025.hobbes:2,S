Linus' fix allowing unhashed src dentries seems ok, if that is what
you are looking for.

Not necessarily. One example is the fact that d_lookup() can
only increase d_count. Besides, dput() decrements d_count
without dcache_lock, so I am not sure holding dcache_lock during
d_count test buys you much.
We will do some audit tomorrow and see if there are issues here.
