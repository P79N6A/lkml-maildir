that's hiding the problem at the moment, it's global, it doesn't provide
any real guarantee.

one safe way to do it is to take the fail path, try to allocate with
GFP_KERNEL an object on the stack in the fail path, take all the locks
again and try again with the local ram watching if nobody raced. Just
doing a replenishment before entering the critical section it's not
enough, it's still in the "hiding" category if you then consider a
failure if the global mempool is empty at the time you need the atomic
ram.

so it's not too bad in terms of stack because there's not going to be
more than one walk at time, thanks for doing the math btw. You'd
basically need a second radix tree for the dirty pages (using the same
radix tree is not an option because it would increase pdflush complexity
too much with terabytes of clean pages in the tree).
