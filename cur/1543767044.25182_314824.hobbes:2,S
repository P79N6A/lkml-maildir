Root squashing is there to enforce the policy that nobody gets to access
any files with uid=0,gid=0. IOW it is a policy that is first and
foremost meant to make root-owned files untouchable.
Strong security, OTOH, enforces the policy that you need to authenticate
as a given person in order to get at that person's files.
Neither can prevent man-in-the-middle style attacks by root on a client
that is compromised nor can they stop someone who has managed to lift
your username+password from somewhere. Every security policy has its
limitations.

Tough. Your administrator has set a certain policy on the fileserver,
and it is being correctly enforced. If that policy decision turns out to
be unnecessarily strict then you are quite free to plead with the
administrator to change it.
Note that these days CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is no longer guaranteed to be
sufficient even for local disk if the administrator is using LSE to set
up custom policies.
