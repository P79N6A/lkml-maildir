Hi,
I have just tried 2.4.22-ac1 on my VIA C3 EPIA 800 system. Cpufreq
(longhaul) fails both while compiled as a module and compiled in.
I first tried to build it as a module but somehow the module isn't build
at all. Next thing I tried was building it straight in the
kernel....with a direct oops when booting as a result.
The system doesn't have a keyboard or monitor..it did cost me some
fiddling to get it back up running...that's life for a tester...
There also seems to be some problem with the longhaul detection. Normaly
it would print something like:
longhaul: VIA CPU detected. Longhaul version 2 supported
longhaul: CPU currently at 798MHz (133 x 6.0)
longhaul: MinMult(x10)=30 MaxMult(x10)=60
longhaul: Lowestspeed=399000 Highestspeed=798000
But 2.4.22-ac1 printed MinMult and MaxMult to be 0.
Greetings,
Jurgen
