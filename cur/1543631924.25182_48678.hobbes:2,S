It even does not depend on that. That is exactly the difference between
$(shell ) and backquoting.
Try this (with both = and :=):
# Makefile
A=
B=
#A:=
#B:=
A+=$(shell date)
B+=`date`
all:
    @echo "A="$(A)
    @sleep 2
    @echo "A="$(A)
    @sleep 2
    @echo "B="$(B)
    @sleep 2
    @echo "B="$(B)
