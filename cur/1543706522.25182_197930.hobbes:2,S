Sure, other non cache coherent arch's that I'm aware of (PPC, ARM, etc.)
already implement the least expensive cache operations based on the
direction parameter in pci_dma_sync_single(). On PPC, we do the right
thing based on each of three valid directions, I don't yet see what
additional information pci_dma_sync_to_device_single() provides.

It's definitely not obvious since DMA-mapping.txt shows it as having
a direction parameter and makes no claim that it is only for the
FROM_DEVICE direction.  In addition, all the non-coherent arches I've
worked on implement all the directions.

BIDIRECTIONAL would be expensive, yes, that's why pci_dma_sync_single()
implementation use the already present directional information to do
the right thing.
Maybe we need a clear example.
