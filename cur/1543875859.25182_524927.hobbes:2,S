These compile errors are from compiling mplayer? Something is not right 
here, it shouldn't be including that header file at all - and I'm not 
sure how anything in /usr/include could be ending up trying to do so.
__KERNEL__ is only supposed to be defined when building the kernel 
itself. Current kernels (not sure if 2.6.16 had this though) have a 
process which generates header files suitable for userspace from the 
kernel's header files and strips out everything inside #ifdef __KERNEL__.
