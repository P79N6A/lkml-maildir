Subject: [PATCH] Fix rcutree grace-period-latency bug on small systems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Kudos to Andi Kleen for finding a grace-period-latency problem!  The
problem was that the special-case code for small machines never updated
the ->signaled field to indicate that grace-period initialization had
completed, which prevented force_quiescent_state() from ever expediting
grace periods.  This problem resulted in grace periods extending for more
than 20 seconds.  Not subtle.  I introduced this bug during my inspection
process when I fixed a race between grace-period initialization and
force_quiescent_state() execution.
The following patch properly updates the ->signaled field for the
"small"-system case (no more than 32 CPUs for 32-bit kernels and no more
than 64 CPUs for 64-bit kernels).
I believe that this patch should be included for 2.6.29.
