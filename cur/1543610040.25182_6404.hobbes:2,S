Subject: Driver callback routine when panic() is called

Hi folks,
I don't know if this is an appropriate question to ask on this mailing list
but I have no idea where to ask. 
Is there any call that can be used for a driver to register system crash
callback routines. Thus, If panic( ) is called, such a callback can save
device-state information to be written into the system crash dump file. 
Thanks,
Naris
