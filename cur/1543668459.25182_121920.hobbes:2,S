Subject: [PATCH] tmpfs 2/6 remove shmem_readpage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

shmem_readpage was created to give tmpfs sendfile and loop ability; but
they're both using shmem_file_sendfile now, so remove shmem_readpage.
