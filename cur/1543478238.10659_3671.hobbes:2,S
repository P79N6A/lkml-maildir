Of course. I was not trying to show it substantially increased performance,
as I noticed by myself that it didn't.
After all I named the patch as 'memory_save'.

Wow.
Now, bouncing to the other side (i.e. talking against my own idea *scream*)
I noticed that some architectures use p->map_nr in the arch/ tree of the code.
In particular sparc64 has a lot of references to it. I wrote a patch to modify
them to (p - mem_map) as well as on all other architectures --- which is really
simple anyway --- but I don't know wether it may hurt performance on some of 
the non-Intel archs.
But maybe i386 does the same, hiding it in some macros...
so I may be completely wrong.
