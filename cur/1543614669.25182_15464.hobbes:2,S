This looks fine to me.  I've added it to my 0.12 driver, bumped the number 
to 0.13, put it up on my web site 
(
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/i810_audio.c.gz
) and if that solves 
people's problems then that's what I'll send to Marcello in a day or so.
Thanks Nathan, I've been to busy to look into it the last little bit :-(
