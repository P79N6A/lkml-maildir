I might have missed this one.  After all, this is a pretty low-traffic
list :-).
Running "accton" (with or without arguments) consistently generates
an oops at linux/kernel/acct.c:169
	BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&acct_globals.lock));
I first saw this when shutting down my machine.  The shutdown scripts
run "accton" without any arguments to terminate accounting, regardless
of whether it's running.
