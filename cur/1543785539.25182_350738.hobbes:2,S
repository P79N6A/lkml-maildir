The Network option or the Filesystes are choosen as a
Standard. So it will be there without checking if they
needed or not. Because I think Protocols like TCP-IP
or Filesystems like NTFS or expt2 has to be installed
on the now days Systems. But if they are any
suggestion or ideas of detecting those thing. No
problem just send me rule that does that and I will
updated easily on the Framework.Thats the benefit of
this Framework.;-)
