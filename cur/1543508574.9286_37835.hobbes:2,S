Hi brethren,
Yesterday I looked at the modem and, unfortunately, looks like a winmodem.
Because in the winmodem.inf it says:
[USR]
%Winmodem.DeviceDesc% = Winmodem,
PCI\VEN_12B9&DEV_1006&SUBSYS_006012B9&REV_00
and lspci -vvx says:
00:09.0 Communication controller: US Robotics: Unknown device 1006

so vendor/device and sub ids match :(
Does one have any ideas on how to proceed? (I suppose I will need some
sort of PCI traffic analyzer for windows or run the driver inside vmware
to learn how it works?)
Regards,
