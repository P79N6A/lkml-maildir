 for that discussion.
I just tried the first failing commit
(02b28a33aae93a3b53068e0858d62f8bcaef60a3):

    [ACPI] Enable Embedded Controller (EC) interrupt mode by default
    "ec_intr=0" reverts to polling
    "ec_burst=" no longer exists.

but with the vanilla (BIOS 1.11) DSDT.  And not only did S3 sleep
happen, but the thermal+processor bug didn't show up: i.e. it did two
(actually) many S3 sleep-wake cycles.  So the problem is due to
something in the modified DSDT, which is either a problem itself or it
exposes another problem.
[Picture of me hanging head in shame for putting people to the trouble.]
My only excuse is that long ago (2.6.11), the machine wouldn't S3
sleep at all with the vanilla DSDT, and I patched it as recommended by
the ACPI experts.  However, the current ACPI interpreter seems to
handle the 600X's mangy DSDT.
Now I agree 100% with Len Brown that it's best to have ACPI handle
marginal DSDT's, not hack the DSDT.
