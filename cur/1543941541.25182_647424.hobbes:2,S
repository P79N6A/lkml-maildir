Oh come on...   You are smart enough to know to at least CC the driver 
maintainer, the key POC who should be aware of breakage of their driver. 
  That is a standard courtesy.

I'm sorry you read "would be nice" as hostility.

As I noted, it is an obvious courtesy to CC the driver maintainer, at 
the very least.
_Especially_ when it is a change that requires some knowledge of the 
hardware, as was this case.

The whole set of changes, yes, not just yours.

The fact is, each larger subsystem (net, scsi, ata I know) has several 
vendor contacts and driver maintainers who for various reasons prefer a 
more focused -- and often less hostile -- mailing list to LKML.
I have a hard enough time as it is, trying to convince hardware vendors 
to work with us, that we are not all assholes.
How about respecting the preferences of certain segments of a very large 
community, even when they differ from your own?  We have a 
community-accepted method of expressing these preferences, the 
MAINTAINERS file.
IMO, standard practice should be:
* To or CC: driver maintainer mentioned in MAINTAINERS (if any)
* CC: LKML, any list mentioned in MAINTAINERS
So, how about CC'ing the targets that have nicely requested to be CC'd?
