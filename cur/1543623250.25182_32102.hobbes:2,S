Please don't do that.
Hopefully, once this is in, 1k blocks will work much better.  There are many
cases where people work with lots of small files, and using 1k blocks is bad
enough, 4k would be worse.
Also, with dhash going into ext2/3 lots of tiny files in one dir will be
feasible and comparible with reiserfs.
