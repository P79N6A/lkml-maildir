Hi,
    This may sound odd, but i want to know if any body
has done any work on assigning IP addresses (may be
Virtual IP) to processes. I am exploring ways on how
to provide IP addresses for processes, files, other
resources , etc. . I would like to get your opinion on
this.
Thanks in advance,
Vijay
