 Thats what I thought, however I thought I'd raise the issue in case
somebody else has seen it as well.
 I've tried three different cd-readers (noname 24X, 40X and 50X drives),
and the CDRW (HDC) is a HP-7200i.  I'm also using the (in)famous VIA3
chipset.  I had to back-off on some dma settings etc. to keep things
stable on hda/hdb under 2.2.14.
