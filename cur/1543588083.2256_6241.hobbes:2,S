Well, on kernel 2.2.19 on a 'regular' PC box (celeron 533), it works
better than the 1.07b version from scyld.com, but it still gets tripped up
pretty bad by nfs traffic. (Have you tried NFS on your board at all?). It
seems to be acting a lot like the 2.4 driver does. (it seems to at least
recover from the error, whereas the scyld.com natsemi.c would appear to
not transmit any packets at all after having trouble).
I'm getting errors in RX packets..
          RX packets:1959 errors:111 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:305
          TX packets:2275 errors:1 dropped:0 overruns:1 carrier:1
If anyone wants the dmesg output of this problem when running with 
'debug=7', please let me know.
