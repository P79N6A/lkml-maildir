Lou, et al.,
	This thread pre-supposes that only data is being accessed.
	What about when a process begins execution? Should the
	size of the process determine whether the whole process
	will be loaded into memory?
	Back to the orginal thread... If we assume reading the
	a single file. Can't our type of access change over
	different areas of the program? Why limit ourselves
	that specify that as long as we open the file, its
	access is going to be random/sequential, whatever...
	This means if we change out access pattern, do we need to
	close and then re-open the file?
	And I haven't even questioned about when do we expect to
	need this data. Currently if we need this data immediately,
	why don't we just lock the data in memory?
	But don't get me wrong, I do believe in some speculation
	and some stats to attempt to correctly estimate the working
	set size to minimize on-demand page faults.
