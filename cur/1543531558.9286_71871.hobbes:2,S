My point is, malloc() fails with or without overcommit. (Unless you
have used /proc to set "suicide mode" overcommit on - disabling ALL
sanity checking on malloc().)
Overcommit only comes into play here if TWO (or more) processes
allocate address space exceeding free memory, WITHOUT using it. This
will then cause problems if BOTH processes then use this memory.
(Without overcommit, at least one process has failed by now.)

Never got a chance? It would have to have left the memory unused for
long enough for another process to allocate AND USE memory in the
intervening period. A fork-malloc bomb might manage this, but normal
code shouldn't - the process which allocates memory first should also
USE that memory first, unless it is broken.

Two or more processes stress-testing the memory subsystem under fault
conditions. One process fails as a result. With Rik's patch, it is
repeatable and predictable which one fails.

This is only a problem if the other processes allocate AND USE address
space between the first one allocating it and using it - and only then
under pre-existing fault conditions.

To a large extent, this is just going round in circles. Ultimately,
when a system runs out of memory, there is something wrong. Disabling
overcommit (if it were possible) would only get you into this
condition faster, so there is little to be achieved by debating it
further.
