That seems sensible and fine. It is precisely why we added a separate
fsuid in the first place so that the user space nfsd could take on an fs
identity without breaking signal and other security based forms.

I can see good arguments for this in some cases where you want strict
divisons in extremely secure computing cases but not usually.

I'd like to know more about why Christoph is objecting, whether he has
actual real world examples of races/problems it introduces by altering
fsuid or what his concern is.
