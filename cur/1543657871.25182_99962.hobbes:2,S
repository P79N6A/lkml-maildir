Makes sense, increasing the delays should reduce the interrupt load.

P3's distributed interrupts round-robin amongst cpus. P4's send 
everything to CPU 0. If you put irq_balance on, it'll spread
them around, but any given interrupt is still only handled by
one CPU (as far as I understand the code). If you hammer one
adaptor, does that generate more interrupts than 1 cpu can handle?
(turn irq balance off by sticking a return at the top of balance_irq,
and hammer one link, see how much CPU power that burns).
