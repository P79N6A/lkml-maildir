Hi, I am trying to find a benchmark program which can show the number of
cycles int80/sysenter take on various hardware. 
I found the following URL
http://colorfullife.com/~manfred/Linux-Kernel/old/sysenter/
Running it on Redhat Fedora with 2.6.0-test8, int80 works fine but I get
a segfault with sysenter (my understanding is that Fedora glibc is
sysenter aware)
Anybody has a pointer to such a benchmark program ?
Regards, Yusuf
