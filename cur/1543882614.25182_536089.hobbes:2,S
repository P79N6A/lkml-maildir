Ok, so I took another look at the report Vladimir sent me. The trace he
ran into was in the delete inode path, but was still a race between the
xattr_sem and the inode sem. Since we're locking the xattr root on the
xattr read path now, this condition arises more freqently, but it's
really the same one he reported.
I'm using the default openSUSE config, which doesn't enable mutex
debugging. I'll rebuild with it, and hopefully come up with a way to
kill the warning.
