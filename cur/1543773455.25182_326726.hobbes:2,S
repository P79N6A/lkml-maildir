Actually..a quick search through LKML and lm_sensors reveals quite a
few, but there could always be more.

Well, aside from this having nothing to do with IBM anymore, I agree
that I personally don't see the great harm in Lenevo releasing the
information. Many other notebook manufactuers have a similair system
now (Apple powerbooks, and some others) so the competitive advantage
is waning.

I don't see how I did either of those :-|. I simply thought you hadn't
seen the statement, obviously you had. I also wanted to provide what I
thought was important feedback on what I had determined myself about
the system.
