linux-fbdev@vuser.vu.union.edu is a good place to go for framebuffer
questions.
For the S3 Trio, I am combining S3triofb.c and cyberfb.c into a single,
new driver.  You can get the current development version at
http://gtf.org/garzik/kernel/files/UNTESTED/s3fb-current.tar.bz2
 -- but
be warned there are still many bugs to be fixed yet.  You are of course
more than welcome to help debug!  :)
The driver is written so that, hopefully, it will take only a few lines
to code to support the older S3 chips.
Regards,
	Jeff
