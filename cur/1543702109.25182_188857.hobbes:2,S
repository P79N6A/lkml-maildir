And mtd map drivers for rom chips run into the same problem except in
that case regions is almost always reserved by the BIOS.
Which means it's just silly for the drivers to fail when request_mem_region
fails.  They are looking at the hardware and know where the regions are, and
there is not a parent device we can request a subregion from when it is the
BIOS that reserves the region.
