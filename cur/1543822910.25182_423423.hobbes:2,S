Subject: [PATCH 0/13: eCryptfs] eCryptfs Patch Set
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/12/404

This patch set constitutes the 0.1.7 release of the eCryptfs
cryptographic filesystem:
http://ecryptfs.sourceforge.net/
It includes numerous updates based on comments on the 0.1.6 submission
made on May 4th. The only functional change worth noting is the
removal of the unnecessary second read in ecryptfs_get1page() and
ecryptfs_do_readpage().
This patch set was produced and tested against the 2.6.17-rc3-mm1
release of the kernel.
Thanks,
Phillip
