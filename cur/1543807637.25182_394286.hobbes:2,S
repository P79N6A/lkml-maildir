That is not enough. Memory access may also be restricted by policies
and then the OOM killer will still go postal. If a process has restricted
its memory allocation by either setting up a policy or a cpuset constrain
then the OOM killer should not be called. Instead either the application 
needs to be terminated (if it set the stupid policy) or the cpuset can 
perform something OOM-killer-like on the processes it controls.
In its simplest form this could look like the following patch (missing 
support for vma policies, and its not certain that a process has just 
attempted an allocation constrained by policy if mempolicy is set).
Maybe we need to set a gfp flag for constrained allocations that will
terminate the app?
