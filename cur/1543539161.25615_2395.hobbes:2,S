Mike,
On a related, but different, note:
Using a 2.4.0-test2-ac2 I created a 2G file with dd which I then
mounted via loopback.  Making an ext2fs on this caused my system to
run out of memory repeatedly (and hang) until I doubled the swap,
giving 144M real plus 144M swap.
Requiring such a large amount of memory to create a filesystem seems
unnecessary.  Is there a particular reason the mkfs.ext2 program has
to write everything into memory before dumping it to disk?  (I'm
guessing this is not really a kernel problem/limitation).
I'm using version
"mke2fs 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09".
Billy
