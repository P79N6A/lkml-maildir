We have a few dual Xeon machines and have enabled
hyperthreading with 2.4.17.  If MTRR is enable and you
start X, we get a CPU cache conflict that will not
release until rebooted.  It appears that the cache is
being thrashed continuously, and the loading is
terrible.  
We have seen discussions of several patches regarding
this problem.  However, we have not found which base
kernel version has the patch applied.  Is this patch
in the 2.4.18 or 2.4.19 pre-release?  Thanks.
Regards,
