You must first format the cd-rw in packet mode with cdrwtool before 
pktcdvd can write to it.

You can't mkudffs on pktcdvd unless the media has been formatted for 
packet mode, or in MRW mode, at least until the recent patches were 
applied.  If the media is formatted for MRW mode, then pktcdvd isn't 
required to write to it, but it used to work.  With the new patches 
applied it will refuse to access MRW discs.
