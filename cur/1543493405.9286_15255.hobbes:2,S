That's what I have been saying all along. If you don't elaborate on this
central point, you aren't saying how to do it at all. Case closed.

That is your personal machine, I presume. If it was a production, security
sensitive machine, you would have had to find another, trusted way to get a
new kernel onto it.

"Capability to run this perl script as an ELF executable" makes a lot of
sense, agreed.

This is not part of the file itself, it is data about the file, i.e.,
metadata. Nothing wrong there.

DOS is broken in this regard. And putting information on the file _format_
elsewhere than in the file itself just invites errors, better make the
format self-describing if at all practical: I.e., magic numbers et al in
the Unix way.

This kind of stuff is usually handled by some sort of filemanager, the
variety of different file formats is just too big to be handled by the
kernel in any halfway sane way. And new formats are invented every day...

"Sorry, I'd be glad to obligue but I don't know how to do that" and "You
aren't allowed to ask me do that" are quite different outcomes for me.

And binary executables can't either, for exactly the same reasons.

An executable is an executable (that's the Unix tradition), it should be
able to do the same things no matter how it is implemented (another
cherished part of the Unix tradition: Uniformity, even at some cost).

That doesn't mean that the secure and the legacy system have to run on the
same machine at the same time. Someday you _will_ have to switch over. And
at that moment (at the very latest) the "legacy compatibility" becomes a
major burden.

OK, make the above "The various suggestions on how to implement aspects of
the finished design" then. But these suggestions don't really consider a
finished design, they want to kludge their way in the rough direction of
the final goal, and they do not consider seriously how to really achieve
that final goal, so they are fatally flawed, IMO.

Perhaps I am mistaken, and my worries are unfounded, but you really haven't
done much to allay them so far. And I sicerely think that worries such as
mine _have_ to be laid to rest for good before _any_ scheme is adopted as
the final design.
Perhaps I'm being overcautious, but where security is involved "Better safe
than sorry".

Then how do you handle it with your 100% backward compatible tools that
don't need to be even recompiled?

The backup tool runs with the UID of the backup operator, who doesn't have
permission to read most of the files in the system. It might have to backup
raw disk partitions, which the backup operator can't touch under any
circumstances. Please forget about the copout "allmighty root does all",
that is the essence of what capabilities are all about.

Ok, there you have a (partial) point.
