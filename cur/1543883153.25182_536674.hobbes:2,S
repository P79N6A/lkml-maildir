No problem if cryptographic-quality random number generator is reseeded
using high quality entropy. But saving/reseeding PRNG using a plaintext file
as most distros seem to do at shutdown and boot does not count as secure.
/dev/urandom state may be predictable for some time after boot. /dev/random
at least waits for new entropy before handing out random bits, and avoids
that predictable state pitfall.
Do most distros attempt to overwrite /var/lib/urandom/random-seed or
whatever after it has been used to reseed /dev/urandom? Does any distro
attempt to overwrite that file?
For the record, loop-AES versions of mount/losetup/swapon that set up random
key loop devices, use /dev/urandom. But they also attempt to work-around
possibly predictable boot-time /dev/urandom bits. The work-around is
basically random-seed save/restore (to backing device) but with 20
overwrites of saved-state after it has been used to create new encryption
keys. See source for more details.
