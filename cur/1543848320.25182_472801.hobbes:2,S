Here's the decision matrix for libata:  Will the hardware use the 
standard taskfile push/pull functions like ata_tf_load(), ata_tf_read(), 
ata_exec_command(), etc.?  If yes, simply replace ata_std_ports() call 
with a call to your own function, written similarly to 
pdc_ata_setup_port() in sata_promise.c.
If the hardware requires non-standard I/O accessors, or the register 
sizes themselves changed, then you must implement your own taskfile I/O 
functions, similar to k2_sata_tf_load(), k2_sata_tf_read(), and 
k2_bmdma_setup_mmio() in sata_svw.c.  For this case, data in struct 
ata_ioports is largely up to you to manage, or ignore.
If there are special command setup or teardown operations, there are 
other standard hooks to override as well.
