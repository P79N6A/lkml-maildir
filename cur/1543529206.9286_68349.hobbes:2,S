Check out the various Serial HOWTO's, PPP HOWTO, and other
similarly named howto's.  I set up the above using one of the
HOWTO's before, but I can't remember exactly which one.

Huh?  I don't exactly understand the question...  But for IP
forwarding, you generally just:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
and then ensure the route's are added properly.  I don't
understand your IP masquerade problem.
