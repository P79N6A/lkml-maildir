Hi!
If you still have your 3-button MouseSystems (or any other serial) mouse
somewhere in your driver, forgotten becase of the incredibly slow update
rate causing so much jumping of the pointer on the screen that it is
unusable, you may want to pull it out and give it a try.
Or if you're still using it with some old 486 computer, this driver is
for you. 
What it does is that it enhances the update rate from 24 (with current
GPM and X drivers) to 96. This is almost what the best USB mice do.
It's a kernel driver. Yes, it's a kernel driver for serial mice,
something that has been loathed by some. In 322 lines of code, all of
serial mouse handling. And much better than ever before.
Try it out. Installation notes are in the README file.
Patch against 2.4.5-ac9.
Have fun ...
