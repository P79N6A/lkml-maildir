Yes, I also realised that, and other people also seem to think it is this way.
So the conclusion is basically that the card can't chew data that fast and I
should use busmastering instead of memcpy (and other drivers should do that
too because "hidden load" occurs anyway). I'm working on it.
Thanks to all who replied, I am as always pleased by the cooperation in
open-source world and wish everyone good luck. Yeah, and linux rocks of course
:-)
