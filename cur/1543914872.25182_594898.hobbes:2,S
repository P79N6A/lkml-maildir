Totally inappropriate.
I bet 99% of all "dentry_lookup()" calls involve turning the last dentry 
from having a count of zero ("movable") to having a count of 1 ("pinned").
So such an approach would fundamentally be broken. It would slow down all 
normal dentry lookups, since the *common* case for leaf dentries is that 
they have a zero count.
So it's much better to do it on a "directory/file" basis, on the 
assumption that files are *mostly* movable (or just freeable). The fact 
that they aren't always (ie while kept open etc), is likely statistically 
not all that important.
