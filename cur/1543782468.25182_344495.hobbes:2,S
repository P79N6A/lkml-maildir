Would you just be able to add the atomic sysctl handler that
Christoph suggested?
This introduces lost update problems. 2 CPUs may store to nr_files
in the opposite order that they incremented atomic_nr_files.
It is not terribly bad, because the drift is not cumulative and the
field can't go negative... but its just ugly to add this hack
because there is no atomic sysctl handler.
Eliminating the cli/sti is a good idea though, I think.
