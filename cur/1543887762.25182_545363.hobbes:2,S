/proc/cpuinfo sent in the first message in this thread (anticipated your
request :-)), but it's small enough to repeat:
processor	: 0
vendor_id	: AuthenticAMD
cpu family	: 5
model		: 9
model name	: AMD-K6(tm) 3D+ Processor
stepping	: 1
cpu MHz		: 451.040
cache size	: 256 KB
fdiv_bug	: no
hlt_bug		: no
f00f_bug	: no
coma_bug	: no
fpu		: yes
fpu_exception	: yes
cpuid level	: 1
wp		: yes
flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 pge mmx syscall 3dnow k6_mtrr
bogomips	: 902.78
clflush size	: 32
Here's the requested dmesg output (for 2.6.21):

NVRM: CPU does not support the PAT, falling back to MTRRs.
