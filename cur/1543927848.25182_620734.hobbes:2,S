rx and tx are closely related. You rarely have one without the other.
In fact, a turned implementation should have zero kicks or interrupts 
for bulk transfers. The rx interrupt on the host will process new tx 
descriptors and fill the guest's rx queue; the guest's transmit function 
can also check the receive queue. I don't know if that's achievable for 
Linuz guests currently, but we should aim to make it possible.
Another point is that virtio still has a lot of leading zeros in its 
mileage counter. We need to keep things flexible and learn from others 
as much as possible, especially when talking about the ABI.

The BIOS wouldn't work even on x86 because it isn't mapped to the guest 
address space (at least not consistently), and doesn't know the guest's 
programming model (16, 32, or 64-bits? segmented or flat?)
Xen uses a hypercall page to abstract these details out. However, I'm 
not proposing that. Simply indicate that we support hypercalls, and use 
some layer below to actually send them. It is the responsibility of this 
layer to detect if hypercalls are present and how to call them.
Hey, I think the best place for it is in paravirt_ops. We can even patch 
the hypercall instruction inline, and the driver doesn't need to know 
about it.

Sure some complexity is unavoidable. But flat is simpler than indirect.

Then we can start selling virtio extension chassis.

Any sufficiently difficult bug is indistinguishable from a feature.
