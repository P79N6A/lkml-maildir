To summarize.
We have an e1000 plugged into a pci-x slot on an Opteron system with
an amd chipset.
That motherboard has 3 ioapics.  (One on each PCI-X bridge and
one on the 8111 for handling everything else.
We know we are getting interrupts through the 8111 ioapic.
We don't know which ioapic the pci-x bus is hooked to.
So either the ioapics on the 8131 are having problems.
Or we have a problem parsing the irq routing tables.
We see in dmesg.
[    0.000000] I/O APIC #2 at 0xFEC00000.
[    0.000000] I/O APIC #3 at 0xE8000000.
[    0.000000] I/O APIC #4 at 0xE8001000.

So it looks like the kernel moved the ioapics.
The following patch in 2.6.18-mm1 is known to have that effect.
x86_64-mm-insert-ioapics-and-local-apic-into-resource-map
Can you please try reverting that one patch?
There is a fix an updated version of that patch I think in -mm2
but I haven't had a chance to see if it fixes the problem yet.
