I use %ebp, it seemed to work last time I played with it:
static inline
int st_mmap (void *addr, size_t len, int protection, int flags, int fd,
off_t offset)
{
  int result;
  asm volatile (
    "pushl %%ebp	\n"
    "movl  %6, %%ebp	\n"
    "movl  %7, %%eax	\n"
    "int   $0x80	\n"
    "popl  %%ebp	\n"
    : "=a" (result)
    : "b" (addr), "c" (len), "d" (protection),
      "S" (flags), "D" (fd), "m" ((offset >> PAGE_SHIFT)),
      "i" (__NR_mmap2)
    : "memory");
  return result;
}
I thing I got it from an straight disassemble dump of glibc's
mmap().
