Oh, there's lots of code:
	A "hardened" binary kernel driver:
		
http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/hardeneddrivers/sampledriver-0.1-1.i386.rpm
	(um people, why a binary?  Where's the source for this?)
	Some header files:
		
http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/hardeneddrivers/ddhardening_headerfiles.tar.gz
	A bunch of diagnostics code:
		
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/code/cpu_affinity-v0.2.1.tar.gz
		
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/code/pmem-0.2.1.tar.gz
		
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/code/crms-0.1.1.tar.gz
	And a bunch of resource monitoring code:
		
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54710
CG people, are you wanting any of this code to be in the main kernel?
If so, why have you not submitted it to anyone yet?  And why did you
write any code before the spec was ready if you said you were not going
to do that?
thanks,
greg k-h
