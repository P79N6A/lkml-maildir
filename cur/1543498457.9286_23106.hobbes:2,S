I am really afraid that you opened up a whole can of worms with this
idea, considering that even a simple static HTML page can contain lots
of different headers like Date:, Expires:, Content-Type:, Connection:
and so on. I'm not that happy about getting things like "building a
Date: Header with time zone and everything" in the kernel. And if you
use files with pre-tacked headers, you lose these informations which
are crucial to the whole proxy-caching process on the Net.
I think, khttpd is a path along which (sooner or later) lies madness
and an apache in kernel space.
	Kind regards
