You don't give us much to work with!  
Here are some questions:
 1. Does NFS work as a modules?
 2. Did you select `Root file system on NFS'?
 3. Do you have any NFS filesystems listed in your fstab file?
 4. Do you see any text after you select the kernel, `Loading
    kernel...' for example?
 5. What kind of hardware do you have?
 6. Did you read `linux/REPORTING-BUGS'?
