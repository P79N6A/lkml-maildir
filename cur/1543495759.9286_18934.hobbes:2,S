Hi folks,
I have noticed that when I delete a big file (say 800MB), with a rm
command, for example, the rm command does not return until the file has
been deleted (or so it seems). With small files, this is almost
inmediate, but with files which are say 800 megs in size, this can
easily be 10 seconds (_seconds_, it's right) till I get the prompt
again, on a P2-333.
In other Unices, like IRIX, the rm command returns _inmediately_, no
matter the size of the file.
Looks to me like the unlink syscall is somewhat synchronous, and it
shouldn't, or does it? For this concrete issue, it could be easily
solved by the unlink syscall starting a thread to unlink the big file,
while the rest of the system keeps running normally. But I suppose it's
not only an issue of the unlink syscall, but more...
I'm probably saying nonsense WRT the solution, but the problem _is_
there. Any answers/constructive-criticisms?
J.
