Subject: repost: Artop AEC865 support in 2.4 kernel?

Can anyone clarify the status of support for the Artop AEC865 chipset in the
2.4.x kernel series? Digging thru the archives, I see what appears to be at
least a more current aec62xx.c ('Version 0.11        March 27,
2002/Copyright (C) 1999-2000     Andre Hedrick (andre@linux-ide.org)' in the
head of the file) than what is included in the 2.4.18 & 2.4.19-pre patches
(version 0.09). I also saw the Andre/Vojtech 'exchange' on copyright, so I
know some 'issues' exist with the sourcefile in question.
My card is a Siig CN2487, SC-PE4B12 UltraATA/133; they have a 'driver'
listed on their site, which appears to be a hacked group of files
(aec62xx.c, ide-dma.c, ide-pci.c, pci.ids, pci_ids.h)
(
http://www.siig.com/drivers/ide_pc_pci_driver.html
) but is quite picky on
compiling into a kernel. They also appear to be based on older versions of
pciutils (before 2.1.10; header of pci.ids contains '$Id: pci.ids,v 1.62
2000/06/28 10:56:36 mj Exp $'). Will support be included in the
near/foreseeable future?
Thanks,
