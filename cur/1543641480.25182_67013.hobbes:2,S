Adam,
If you had followed what is going on with loop crypto, you would have known
that loop-AES' AES cipher is based on Dr Brian Gladman's implementation, and
as such is about twice as fast as the one in cryptoapi. Here is some data on
AMD Duron 800 MHz:
key length 128 bits, encrypt speed 354.3 Mbits/sec
key length 128 bits, decrypt speed 359.3 Mbits/sec
key length 192 bits, encrypt speed 298.8 Mbits/sec
key length 192 bits, decrypt speed 297.7 Mbits/sec
key length 256 bits, encrypt speed 258.8 Mbits/sec
key length 256 bits, decrypt speed 260.6 Mbits/sec
So if you really cared about speed, you would not be using cryptoapi. Also,
your loop patch will deadlock when used to encrypt swap. My loop patch does
not.
