You're not the first to do that - I stayed away from preprocessor variables
other than CONFIG_* when I chunked through a big #if/#ifdef cleanup a few
months ago, simply because my poor brain was too tiny to figure out what was
intended.
Oddly enough, all the abuses I gave up on trying to figure out were
of the form '#if FOO_DEBUG > N', while the non-debugging comparisons
in a #if were all fairly clear.  That says something about kernel programmers,
but I'm not sure what.. :)
