You mean the scsi code wants to schedule a work some time in the future and
that when it executes, the handler will then run for several seconds?
If so, it sounds like this is the wrong mechanism to use.  We certainly
don't want keventd gone to lunch for that long, and even if the kernel
threads were privately created by the scsi code, you'll have to create many
such threads to get any sort of parallelism across many disks.  I suspect
I'm missing something.

Well yes, the caller wouldn't want to be holding any locks which cause
currently-queued works to block.

OK.
