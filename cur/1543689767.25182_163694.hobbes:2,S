Auch!

That explains the hang I just saw in one run of Ulrich's test...
And it explain's why it's not repeatable.
With key1 == key2, you get to move nr_requeue waiters to the end of
the waiting list.  I can't think of a good use for it, but it does do
something visible.

Subtle, when nr_requeue > 1.  That's a disturbingly nice trick :)

Yes.  I just spotted it too.

Fair point about about debuggability, but does it really save bytes to
uninline these called-once functions?
