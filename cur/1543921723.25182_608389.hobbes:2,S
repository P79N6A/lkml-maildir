I have my systems set up to automount my home directory over
NFS when I log in.  When trying to log in to the system with
2.6.23-mm1, I get the messages from above in my syslog, and
the NFS filesystem is not automounted.
I am thinking something in autofs or the pid-namespace* patches
does not match up and uses a wrong PID number or process pointer
when trying to lock things.
Which code is at fault I have no idea...
