Whilst trying to find out why 53/54 is not detecting everything on my 
pci bus (See my previous mails e1000 not detected and pci problems) I 
found a problem with menuconfig
In the PCI Bus section, setting the pci access method to BIOS or direct 
does not get saved on exit. It always defaults back to "Any" on next 
make menuconfig
My problem regarding an incomplete pci bus scan is also still 
outstanding; Any help or suggestions where to look in the code would be 
apprieciated.
