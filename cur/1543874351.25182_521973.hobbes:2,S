I would personally prefer that, but I don't want to block David's
patch from being merged if the ->fault patches do not get in next
cycle. If the fault patches do make it in first, then yes we should
do the page_mkwrite conversion before merging David's patch.
I'll keep an eye on it, and try to do the right thing.
Thanks,
Nick
