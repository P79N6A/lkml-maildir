Amen.  USB 2.0 orinoco wireless drivers seems to have problems when user space
is set to 1GB.  Works grat with 2GB ad 3GB user space settings.  Problem occurs during
any acces to usb_read_device().  This doesn't look like a ABI problem, looks like 
a problem with the USB subsystem.  The serialize semaphore gets stuck for some
reason. 
On the other topic, ABI compliance sounds a little restrictive since this is after all, an 
open source OS.  Most apps get recompiled and I always download open source 
components for Linux.
