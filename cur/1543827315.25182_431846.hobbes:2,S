Hi,
I have a machnine with Athlon64 X2 and AsRock 939Dual-SATA2 mobo (based
on the ULI chipset) on which the PS/2 devices (keyboard and mouse) are in a
bad correlation with IDE, or at least with the LiteOn DVD burner attached to it.
Namely, when the DVD drive is being used (eg. for burning a DVD in the
background) the keyboard and mouse get a bit flaky.  The mouse/keyboard
response gets noticeably worse, some random key codes are generated and
the mouse sometimes behaves as though a button was pressed (this happens
when I move the mouse without touching the buttons).
I've been observing these symptoms for quite some time, at least with all of
the recent -rc kernels, up to and including 2.6.17-rc6.  Of course I can live
with them and they seem to be related to the hardware, but I thought it might
be a good idea to let you know.
I wonder if anyone has observed similar symptoms recently.
Also, if anyone's interested in more detailed information about the system,
please tell me.
Greetings,
Rafael
