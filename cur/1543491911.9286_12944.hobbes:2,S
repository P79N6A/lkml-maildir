RMS, I respected you for your past leadership of the free software
community, the creation of the GPL, and for your personal efforts in
building free software tools.
But, if you ever again start an offtopic flamewar in a forum that I use,
I will consider myself freed of any obligation to you and your organization.
(apologies for contributing to the disruption)
Bruce
