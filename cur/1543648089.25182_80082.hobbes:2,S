device_suspend() is for power management. device_shutdown() is for 
quiescing devices before a system reboot or power off. 
It's true that the same function is called when the device is physically 
removed from the system as when the system is shutting down, and that 
might be kinda bad. If it gets to the point where it's really difficult to 
deal with for drivers, we can create another callback: ->shutdown() for 
struct device_driver.

No, reboot notifiers are the completely wrong way to go, for one reason 
alone: ordering. device_shutdown() does a depth-first walk of the tree to 
shut down children devices before ancestors. You cannot guarantee that 
with reboot notifiers. 
Please don't try and convolute the code because you're worried about a few
microseconds. It's about correctness first; then we can worry about
micro-optimizing the hell out of it.
