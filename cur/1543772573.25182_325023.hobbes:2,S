I have been investigating what the cause of performance loss could be.
I have noticed several things:
0) Setting to CARM_MAX_Q to 30 hangs. So we have been testing only with
CARM_MAX_Q == 1. The firmware has not been updated yet.
1) If we keep on increasing number of SATA disks, hdparm does not get
multiplied total read performance (hdparm -t ....).
With a Maxtor 60 GB disk with 8MB cache we get 50Mb/sec. If we put
two disks we get 35 on each. Total  70MB/sec. If we put more
then total does not get above 70MB/sec.
It  looks like that a part of the driver serializes the commands.
We have a 32 processor MIPS based system.
2) It looks like that there is while(1) loop under spinlock in isr
stack. If we start queuing many commands then it may take a while for
this loop to break. Though I am not quite familiar with the driver yet.
If we set CARM_MAX_Q to 30 then the request/response queue length should
also be increased right?
3)  Next I will put PCI-X analyzer and figure  out the root cause of
performance loss. May be need to get hold of the technical manual.
