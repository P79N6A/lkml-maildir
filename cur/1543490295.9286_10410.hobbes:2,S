you wrote 'the system is a relatively big machine'.
Perhaps you have run out of virtual memory.
How much memory do you try to allocate? (more than 1 Gigabyte?)
How much physical memory do you have?
You Could also pause the process as soon as you calloc returns NULL
(i.e. if(ptr==NULL) while(1) { printf("error!!\n");} )
and look at the informations in /proc/<pid>. The file formats are
described in 'man proc'.
