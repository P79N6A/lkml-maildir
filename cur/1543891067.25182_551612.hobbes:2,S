Intel is working on a work-around/fix for this problem, they said I need 
to wait another day or so until it is completed.  I will let everyone know 
what the outcome is, hopefully it is a good fix :)  I totally agree 
however, a lot of 'weird' problems that some people may attribute to Linux 
are actually BIOS problems, I think warnings in the kernel would be a good 
idea, then they would not have to blame the kernel for BIOS issues :)
Justin.
