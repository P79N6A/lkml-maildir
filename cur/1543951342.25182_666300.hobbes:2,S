We are trying to not add pci ids that are only used in one place within
the kernel.  Why can't the perfomon init code just add this value to
their code?
Or make this part of the perfmon patch itself, if you really must have
it.  No need to add it to the kernel if there are no in-tree users,
right?
thanks,
