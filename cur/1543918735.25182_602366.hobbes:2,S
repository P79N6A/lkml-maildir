The simple non-patch solution is to up the priority of the serial 
console irq to maximum. That's usually sufficient to catch runnaway tasks 
etc. It does not interfere with the system in normal operation as long as 
you do not hit keys in your minicom.
I doubt that your patch has a chance to survive lockdep and anything which 
is not a sysrq.
