I would like to have two different events for dock and undock.
This way the userspace listener don't need to check the status file in
sysfs to know if there was a dock or undock after getting the event.
Anyway the status file is still usefull for programs don't react on
the events, but like to know if the laptop is docked before starting
for example.
