Subject: [RFC] Dynamic Tick and Deferrable Timer Support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello All,
I have been working to maximise the kernel sleep time on an embedded device by utilising the dynamic tick and deferrable timer features.
During the course of this work I found that although timers were configured as deferrable, only timers for time interval tv1 were actually being deferred. Reviewing the deferrable timer patch [1], it does appear that the code is written to only defer timers for interval tv1. Therefore, I wanted to ask if this is intentional or not?
I have applied the below patch to defer all deferrable timers regardless of interval and so far it is working on the embedded device. I wanted to share this in case this could be something that could be applied to the mainline.
Please excuse any foolish mistakes I may have made here as this is my first post to your mailing list. Any feedback you could offer would be appreciated.
Cheers
Jon
