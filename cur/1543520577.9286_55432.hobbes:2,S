	If the problem with making the stack unexecutable is a few
pieces of trampoline code, then how about just modifying the few
programs that use this code to mprotect the stack when they actually
need it to be executable?  Even if these programs simply made their
entire stack area executable at initialization time, at least the
other programs would be considerably more secure.
	I believe this change would eliminate about half of the root
exploits that I see reports of, or, to put it more dramatically, it
would eliminate more exploits than all other improvements combined.
