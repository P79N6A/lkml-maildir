No no, writing end user documentation is much easier than writing
kernel code!
But either way you needn't worry about it because this isn't something
that you would want to tweak from userspace really. If you find it
useful to do some tuning then I guess it can go in -mm.

maxthinktime of 5 is below the default antic_expire of 6. This
basically turns off the thinktime heuristic, so it isn't really
surprising that it runs like crap.
The *minimum* maxthinktime you should be playing with is probably
about double the antic_expire value.
Raising the value will make the heuristic a bit more restrictive
which could be a good idea. I think OSDL's STP has a couple of
database tests where the anticipatory scheduler has a small
regression (dbt2, dbt3). They might be helpful to you.
