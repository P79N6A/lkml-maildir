so just mirror to a local disk array then.
a local disk array has more write bandwidth than a network connection to a 
remote machine, so if you can mirror to a remote machine you can mirror to 
a local disk array.

if by traditionalists you mean everyone who makes a living keeping systems 
running you are right. we want sane failure modes as much as we want 
performance.
there will be times when we decide to go for speed at the expense of 
safety, but we want to do it knowingly, not when someone is promising both 
and only provides speed.
and by the way, if the violin box use your software they have just moved 
from a resource for me to tap when needed to something that I will advise 
my company to avoid at all costs.
