	Hello,
	Install the 'module-init-tools' package, from:
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/
	This is required for the new series of kernels, starting with 2.5.50 (I
think), 2.5.72 certainly requires it.

However, the insmod utility I am using to load new driver was from 2.4.20-8 which has system_query_module() being called.  I checked Doc. and source code for 2.5.72 and could not find same function call in module.c
