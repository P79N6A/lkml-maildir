i believe RT-LSM provides a way to solve this cleanly: you can make your
audio app setguid-audio (note: NOT setuid), and make the audio group
have CAP_SYS_NICE-equivalent privilege via the RT-LSM, and then you
could have a finegrained per-app way of enabling SCHED_FIFO scheduling,
without giving _users_ the blanket permission to SCHED_FIFO. Ok?
this way if jackd (or a client) gets run by _any_ user, all jackd
processes will be part of the audio group and can do SCHED_FIFO - but
users are not automatically trusted with SCHED_FIFO.
you are currently using RT-LSM to enable a user to do SCHED_FIFO, right? 
I think the above mechanism is more secure and more finegrained than
that.
