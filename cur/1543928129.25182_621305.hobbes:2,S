Yes you are right. IIRC there was a patch from you, but I didn't follow the
discussion, sorry, so I don't know what was the verdict.
If we remove that "almost setsid" from copy_process(), we can remove the fat
comment and the "session != 1" chunk from setsid().

This is different, perhaps we can keep this call. kernel_thread(kernel_init)
attaches /sbin/init to init_struct_pid. Nothing bad, and a "good" init should
do setsid() anyway. But who knows? Some special environment may expect that
getpgrp() != 0. Not that I really disagree on this issue though.
