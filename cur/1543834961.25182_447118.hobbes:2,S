I think people take this "DMA" in Ulrich's interface names too
literally.  It is logically something different, although it could be
used directly for this purpose.
View it rather as memory you have by some key based ID, but need to
explicitly map to access directly.

Interesting idea, and yes I have been watching you stress test your
AVL tree code :))
