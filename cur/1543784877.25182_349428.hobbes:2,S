Simple. Usually I do not, because many of them do not
depend on each other. In cases where I must, I code it
in the script.
This is how do I wait for automount to start before
I mkswap/swapon on a windows nt swapfile:
echo -n "* Setting up swap"
i=9; while test "$i" -gt 0; do
    if test -d /mnt/auto/vfat.hda1; then
        echo
        mkswap /mnt/auto/vfat.hda1/PAGEFILE.SYS
        swapon /mnt/auto/vfat.hda1/PAGEFILE.SYS
        exit
    fi
    echo -n "."
    sleep 1
let i-=1; done
echo
Probably a small tool can make it look less ugly
(say, 'waitfor <seconds> <cmd> [<param>]'):
if waitfor 10 test -d /mnt/auto/vfat.hda1; then ...; fi

There is GPLed replacement of daemontools at
