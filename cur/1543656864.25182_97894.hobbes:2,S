There obviously are bugs in GCC, and the kernel team work around the
known ones.  This is part of the reason that there is a recommended
compiler version.  The Linux kernel also uses GCC compiler extensions,
and those can change between GCC versions.
The kernel has bugs too, but if they are not triggered by the
recommended version of GCC, then they might not get fixed immediately,
especially if the fix is non-trivial.

A higher -O setting does not necessarily mean better performance -
loop unrolling is one compiler optimisation that I *think* is
performed by GCC at high -O settings, and that *often* causes code to
be slower.
