Again, I did not say don't every discuss it.  I said release it responsibly.
That form follows:
a) find the bug, do the exploit and fix.
b) notify the vendor
c) wait ~two weeks
d) announce it
And this form follows.  There is nothing at all wrong with the courtesy of
giving the vendor a chance to fix the bug before you announce it.
With the LK, your daily changelog would have an "ATA protocol violation API
fix".  Then when distro's have been notified you make a public announcement
of it:  "ATA protocol violation API allowed possibly dangerous commands to be
sent to the IDE processor".

And the respected people grant the vendor advance warning.

Yes it is.  Now the proper thing to do is send modem2brick.c to the vendor
along with discussion and suggested fix if possible.  Talk with the vendor as
necessary then publicly announce it.  Everyone is warm and has happy feelings
when bugs are responsibly released.  Vendors and admins get antsy when
exploits are announced and admins have to wait for a vendor to scramble while
the packet kiddies have a party.
Do you take pleasure in admins being ahead of the packet kiddie or the packet
kiddie ahead of the admin?

And I hope your system is first found :P
I have NEVER advocated CS and and NEVER said NEVER disclose it.  Let me make
myself clear again since a lot of people seem to think that I mean never
disclose it when I say delay before disclosure.
- I never said don't ever disclose it.
- I did say and have frequently referenced a two week disclosure window.
- I have never said closed source.
- I find zero value in providing a tool that will by far and wide be used
only by script kiddies.  Out of a thousand people reading bugtraq, one or two
of them will be using the exploit for good uses and of those one or two, they
probably know how to make an intentionally broken tool work.  I.e. a little
more complex than  #ifdef IKNOWWHATTOFIX  3.141579.
A code fragment that clearly illustrates the bug is sufficient for completely
full disclosure.  A fully operable shell script that compiles an embedded
program to exploit the bug is not neccesary and only sates the hunger of the
packet kiddie.
