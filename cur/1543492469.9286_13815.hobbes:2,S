M$ *have* already released some source, for some versions of "release".  
For example, a number of drivers are in the various DDKs.
The people who look at this, though, are typically not so much laughing at  
M$, but instead swearing at them, for how stupid the source is (and yes,  
it *is* incredibly stupid in places).
