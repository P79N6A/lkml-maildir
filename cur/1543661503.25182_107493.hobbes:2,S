Okay, I had to watch for it a bit longer and it turns out that the kernel PDC driver has a problem in this shared interrupt setup. When loads get high it seems to run into some timing problem which causes things like:
Feb  4 01:02:22 admin kernel: hde: dma_intr: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb  4 01:02:22 admin kernel: 
Feb  4 01:02:22 admin kernel: PDC202XX: Primary channel reset.
Feb  4 01:02:22 admin kernel: ide2: reset: success
Feb  4 01:02:23 admin kernel: hde: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Feb  4 01:02:23 admin kernel: 
Feb  4 01:02:23 admin kernel: hde: drive not ready for command
Feb  4 01:02:23 admin kernel: hde: status error: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
Feb  4 01:02:23 admin kernel: 
Feb  4 01:02:23 admin kernel: hde: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
Feb  4 01:02:23 admin kernel: hde: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb  4 01:02:23 admin kernel: 
Results are that the drive itself just hangs and has to be powered off (resetting the box does not work). The drives worked (and works) fine in non shared-interrupt context. Controller is:
