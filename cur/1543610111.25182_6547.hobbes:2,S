Well, you _can_ spill it, but you need to use "pushfl/popfl" to
spill/restore.
Also, if you're clever you don't spill cc0 itself, but the _comparison_,
ie if you need to spill in
	asm(.. "=cc" (cc0))
	if (cc0 > 0)
a sufficiently clever spill-engine would spill not eflags,  but instead
spill "cc0 > 0", which it can do with the "seq" expansions..
gcc already does know about "store-flag" instructions, although I
certainly agree that the _patterns_ of usage may end up being very
different than existing conditional comparisons..
