Well, since I obviously hadn't, thanks for reporting this ;)
These traces still have a lot of weird things in it, but I think I figured 
out what went wrong now. As a workaround, the following should do.

Anyway, actually, this driver has been superseded by hisax_fcpcipnp, so 
I'd prefer if you used the new driver ("modprobe hisax_fcpcipnp", no 
parameters necessary), to find bugs there. Also, be advised that this is 
not the last bug you'll find in current 2.5 ISDN, but I'll be thankful for 
any reports and testing ;)
