Hi,
Now both 2.4.11-pre2 and linux-2.4.10-ac4 have support support for
/proc/sys/kernel/tainted, it's time to update REPORTING-BUGS to
reflect this change. Here is a patch for this:

+      Note that the kernel maintainers are not interested in bug
+reports that could be caused by the use of binary-only kernel
+modules. To see if your kernel has not been using binary modules, use
+"cat /proc/sys/kernel/tainted". If the output is "0", you can safely
+send your bug report to the maintainers.

 This is a suggested format for a bug report sent to the Linux kernel mailing 
 list. Having a standardized bug report form makes it easier  for you not to 
 overlook things, and easier for the developers to find the pieces of 
The patch should apply cleanly against 2.4.11-pre2 and 2.4.10-ac4.
Please apply.
