Some of the driver model changes that went in result in a link error:
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o: In function `store_uevent':
: undefined reference to `kobject_actions'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Haven't bisected it yet, but I suppose it's pretty obvious to whoever made the
changes. ;-)
