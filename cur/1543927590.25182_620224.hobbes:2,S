There is nothing that guarantees you that your structured types
match what the hardware generates anyways. So it doesn't make much difference --
your type system is already holey.

No, that would lead to bloated code again.

There are not that many new processors so that shouldn't be a huge issue.

Neither is the current code -- you could as well get the types wrong
(unless you auto generate them from RTL or something)

The i386 ifdefs should really go away, except around the 32bit record
structure definitions. 
The noflags variant should be probably data driven too.

Regarding your interface (can you please write those manpages to get a
full rationable)? 
I'm not sure it's a good idea to have a READ_RECORD -- better would 
be likely a batched interface. Probably it would
be cleaner to combine get_index and read_record into a higher
level interface that works like normal read() -- gives you data 
not read before for multiple records. 
Also not sure why you have separate config and allocate_buffer steps.
They could be easily combined, couldn't they?

This should be likely some sort of sysctl. Or perhaps just use user supplied
buffers limited by the mlock ulimit (that would allow zero copy). Ok
it means the high level read interface proposed above wouldn't work.
Perhaps the high level interface is better, although zero copy would
be more efficient. Not 100% sure what is better.

I still think you should cache the DEBUGCTLMSR. If you worry
about other people changing it provide a general accessor.
