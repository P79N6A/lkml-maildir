It's not in Linus' tree just yet - I asked Linus to pull stuff last night.
However, since upgrading FC2 to FC5 (which took anaconda some 4 hours
on a 2.6GHz P4) and thereby moving off my ancient git/cogito version,
various scripts broke and didn't produce the nice requests for Linus.
I guess Linus wasn't too happy about pulling my git trees with only
having a diffstat of what was there...
Maybe something will happen tonight though.
