I'm compiling Linux kernel for a MIPS32 cpu. On my platform, writel seems
expand to:
    static inline writel(u32 val, volatile void __iomem *mem)
    {
            volatile u32 *__mem;
            u32 __val;
            __mem = (void *)((unsigned long)(mem));
            __val = val;
            *__mem = __val;
    }
I don't see the magic in it since "volatile" keyword do not handle memory
ordering constraints...Linus wrote on volatile keyword, see
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0401.0/1387.html

make drivers/mydev.i should do the job but preprocessor doesn't expand inline
functions. So I won't be able to see the expanded writel function.
