You PS/2 ESDI guys might want to set the max sectors for your
driver - old default used to be 128, currently 255 (which maybe
hardware can handle ok?) - the xd and hd drivers were broken until
a similar fix was added to them.
Probably makes sense for driver to set it regardless, seeing 
as default (MAX_SECTORS) has changed several times over last
few months.  At least then it will be under driver control
and not at the mercy of some global value.
Paul.
