Did you remember to enable the proper console related options in your
kernel; like CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE, CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE etc.
I guess it could also be problem with an old or incorrectly configured
udev so it can't find /dev/console or it could be a problem with your
initrd.
And if you could be bothered to stick "Warning: unable to open an
initial console." in google you'll see that you are not the first to
have a problem like that and there is *lots* of help available out
there.
Do a little research please (and if you've already done some research,
then letting people know what you've already checked when posting your
question is usually a good idea).
May I recommend this document :
