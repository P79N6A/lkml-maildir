well, it's not really your 'bug' - the priority setup isnt very 
intuitive at the moment, and the goal is to automate as much of it as 
possible. The way various system threads interact is highly 
implementation dependent, and you shouldnt really be required to know 
about softirq-timer. We'll try to simplify these things as much as 
possible.
