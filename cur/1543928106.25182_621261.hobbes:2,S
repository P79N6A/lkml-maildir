Well, in a strict SELinux system, someone who has been permitted the  
"Security Administrator" role (secadm_r) and who has logged in  
through a "login_t" process may modify and reload the policy.  They  
are also permitted to view all files up to their clearance, write  
files below their level, and relabel files.  On the other hand, they  
do not have any system-administration privileges (those are reserve  
for sysadm_r).
Under the default policy the security administrator may disable  
SELinux completely, although that too can be adjusted as "load  
policy" is yet another specialized permission.
