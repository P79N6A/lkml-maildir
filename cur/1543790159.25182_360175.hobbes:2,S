Ok, sounds good.  As long as they at least start converging...

Cool.

Great, thanks, will do.

Sure.  But if the other mm changes in -mm were not going forward it
would be a little silly to get page_mkwrite to work there only to have
to rewrite it in order to get it merged...
If Linus really is going to release .14 in the next few days,
page_mkwrite is never going to make it into .15 anyway, no matter
what...  But .16 would be a realistic target I would have thought which
seems to fit in nicely with the plans for -mm.  (-:
