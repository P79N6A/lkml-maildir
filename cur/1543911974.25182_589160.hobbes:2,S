The slow path is more likely to be triggered by settings in the per cpu 
structure. The cmpxchg failure is comparatively rare. So the worst case
is getting worse but the average use of interrupt enable/disable may not 
change much. Need to have some measurements to confirm that. I can try to 
run the emulation on IA64 and see what the result will be.
