That should be harmless - they are both unique, and it's just due to
different PCI region allocation for the new PCI code (and when
soft-booting from an older setup it will remember and honor the old
address).
The much more likely cause is the "magic registers" for the Texas
Instruments PCI1225, namely
		works		broken
	81:	b0		90
	a8:	11		10
Although it worries me a bit that your second controller also seems to
have differences in the BridgeCtl thing (16bInt).
Can you try if a broken setup is fixed by doing a
	setpci -s 00.04.0 81.b=b0
	setpci -s 00.04.0 a8.b=11
	setpci -s 00.04.1 81.b=b0
	setpci -s 00.04.1 81.b=11
or similar?
Also, how much memory does this machine have? That "13ff0000" does worry
me a bit..
