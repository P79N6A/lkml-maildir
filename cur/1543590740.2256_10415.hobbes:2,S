Hi,
Was there any change in the PCI initialization code between versions
2.4.0-test8 and 2.4.2.?
I am working on a card and for the same register settings of the card, DMA
from host memory to card memory is successfull for the 2.4.0-test8 but on
2.4.2 kernel, the data transfer is successfull but data gets corrupted.
However the DMA from card memory to system memory is succesull on both the
versions of kernel.
I am not on mailing list. So reply to my id as listed in CC.
Thanks,
Daljeet Maini
