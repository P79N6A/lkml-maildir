I don't see that set_tvaudio() uses any 64-bit comparisons at all, so I 
have this suspicion that the linker reports the wrong function or 
something. 
It might help to use "objdump" to disassemble the object file and see 
where the call to __ucmpdi2 really is - or just build the file as an asm 
file in the first place ("make drivers/media/video/cx88/cx88-video.s") and 
see if you see anything interesting there.

I'm susprised too. gcc has historically done all the "simple" 64-bit ops
in-line, since they usually are just two instructions or so, and doing
them out-of-line tends to be _more_ work with argument setup etc.
Also, most of the time when this happens, we didn't really want 64-bit
arithmetic in the first place ("long long" arithmetic generates not only
slower and bigger code, it's historically been pretty buggy in gcc, so
most of the kernel is pretty careful about minimizing it). I suspect that
this will end up being the same thing (ie we wanted a 64-bit temporary
result to avoid overflows, but didn't actually need to propagate it all
the way).
