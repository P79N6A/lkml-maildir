Indeed the only line of dmesg showing i mounted the partition is
   loop: loaded (max 8 devices)
Still I actually mount an image : i can add files, edit and so on. If
i use the emulator and mount the partition, this partition works
perfectly and even the df commands works.
Now i tried to understand what is going on and traced the program :
It appears that the trouble is in  the count_free of file
fs/minix/bitmap.c . This procedure is actually called twice when we
issue a df command.
The point where things start to get strange is
        i = ((numbits - (numblocks-1) * bh->b_size * 8) / 16) * 2; at line 36
In the first call to that procedure i have
       i = 3506
       bh->b_data = 0xd4e79000
Whereas in the second call i have something much different :
       i = 536838736
       bh->b_data = d4e78000
Tt really seems to me that this value should not be so large.
Unfortunately, i cannot get any deeper in tracing the problem since
even if i tried to read the code, it not documented, so i can't be
sure I understand everything you're doing in count_free ...
Regards,
Cédric
