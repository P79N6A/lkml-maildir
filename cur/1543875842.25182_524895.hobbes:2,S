Yes,
	When HPET is active it eats RTC IRQ,
	So the only way out is to emulate RTC using HPET,
	It is done this way in old rtc driver, rtc-cmos should do the same.
	Of course suspend resume is not supported at all by old rtc driver
	I already wrote complete support for suspend/resume for old rtc driver (I wrote it long time ago)
	Now I fixed it to support HPET , and this way I discovered that HPET doesn't have suspend resume functions
	I will do last checks now and send this patch very soon
	I am also planning to add support of HPET and suspend/resume for rtc-cmos, but I didn't start this yet.
	Best regards,
