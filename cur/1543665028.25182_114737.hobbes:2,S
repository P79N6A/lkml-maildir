Yup,
  Thanks I got that. The physical address is computed using (virtual address) - PAGE_OFFSET. So if my decompressed kernel is loaded at the physical address 0x200000 (I defined this address), I would need the linker to know it. Actually I went past that stage and now I got into start_kernel.. however it seems to be hanging somewhere after that. 
Is there any other kernel changes I need to make to avoid this hanging for a normal boot.

Well, this sounds very much like your vmlinux is relocated to the wrong 
adresses, and then it's not surprising it doesn't work. You definitely 
want to change arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S. I'm not sure if you actually want 
to change PAGE_OFFSET, but I don't see a fundamental reason why it should 
be needed, so I think you should try as-is.
