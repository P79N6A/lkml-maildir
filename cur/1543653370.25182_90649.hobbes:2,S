Dan, at the beginning I had the same thought as yours. Now I sort of
changed my mind. The epoll interface is basically seeing the light in
these days and even if right now it uses f_op->poll(), tomorrow we don't
know. To avoid painful code changes later is IMHO better to define EPOLL*
bits right now. They'll be the same of the POLL* bits but will enable
epoll to be independent from poll.h bits. At least to the outside world.
Same for the event structure.
