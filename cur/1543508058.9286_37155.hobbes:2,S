 I think that this problem seems to be theoretical, and can't be solved
with different "program killers", as criteria to kill is _very_ heuristic.
The problems is: 
1. should we allow succesfully allocate more memory, that we can really
give, in hope that we'll have it in the future.
2. if answer to 1. is true, then we should _correctly_ handle cases  when 
application will be out of memory not when malloc'ing, but when  
reading/writing. Maybe send signal, or message box:
 "You program/kernel performed illegal operation.." ;))
Anyway, current situation is completly unacceptable for me.
Thanks,
  Nikolay.
