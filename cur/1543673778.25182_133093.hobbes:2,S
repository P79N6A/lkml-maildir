Subject: disk corruption in 2.5.66-bk5 - 2.5.69

	linux-2.5.66-bk5 changed blkdev_put in fs/block_dev.c
to only call sync_blockdev if bdev->bd_openers drops to zero.
For me, this has resulted in disk corruption when lilo runs
under kernels 2.5.66-bk5 through 2.5.69, even if I run
"sync" repeatedly after running lilo.
	I am not sure why I seem to be the first person reporting
this disastrous problem.  I suspect it may have something to do
with the fact that I boot from an initial ramdisk that changes
the root without using pivot_root (instead, process 1 does a chroot
at a time when it is the only process on the system) and the fact
that I user partitions defined by partx rather than kernel-based
partitioning.  Perhaps bdev->bd_openers never drops to zero in this
configuration as a result of some other bug that only occurs in
such a configuration.
	I notice also that that change in 2.5.66-bk5 causes
sync_blockdev to be called with the big kernel lock held, although
I do not think that is the cause of the data corruption.
	With the following kludge, the lilo data corruption 
in 2.5.69 seems to be gone.  I have deliberately not cleaned
up this patch for integration at this point, because I don't
understand the issue enough yet to know the real problem
and the right fix.
