Okay, okay, I didn't really make my point persuasively enough.
The file linux/drivers/char/mem.c contains this:
===================================================
static ssize_t write_null(struct file * file, const char * buf,
                          size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
        return count;
}
===================================================
Now try this little program:
---------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/fcntl.h>
main() {
    char buf[1];
    int fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR);
    int i;
    for (i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
        int ret = write(fd, buf, 429496729 * i);
        if (ret < 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "i = %d, errno = %d\n", i, errno);
            perror("write");
            }
        }
    } 
---------------------------------------------------
Result is this:
---------------------------------------------------
i = 6, errno = 0
write: Success
i = 7, errno = 0
write: Success
i = 8, errno = 0
write: Success
i = 9, errno = 0
write: Success
i = 10, errno = 6
write: Device not configured 
---------------------------------------------------
To me, it's pretty clear that an error has occurred here.
The error "Device not configured" has _not_ occurred.
So it is an error for the kernel to say that it has!
The cause is obviously that fact that the people who worked out
the input/output types for write(2) didn't allow for the
possibility that someone might really be able to
write 2 GBytes or more at a time.
But this is now becoming credible in some people's computers (not mine).
I.e. whenever anyone tries to write 2 GBytes or more to a device,
they're going to get a negative return value and possibly a positive
errno value - _if_ the device permits such a big chunk to
be written at once, which /dev/null does.
The device might be a 622 Mbit/sec ATM card or something.
That's only about 25 seconds of transmission time.
So it's not unrealistic.
Questions:
Should device drivers in general be written to truncate the
user-space request down to 2 GByte - 1 (2^31 - 1) or less?
Or should the device driver flag such excessive write-calls as erroneous?
I still think that write_null() should be rewritten as:
===================================================
static ssize_t write_null(struct file * file, const char * buf,
                          size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
        return (count <= 2147483647) ? count : 2147483647;
}
=================================================== 
This would fix the problem without introducing any new errors.
(Unless someone change the definitions of ssize_t and size_t!!)
Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
