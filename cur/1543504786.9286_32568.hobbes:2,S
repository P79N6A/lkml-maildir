    Most people just don't have the time to write, search for, or recompile
another better interface.  Especially for stuff like info for which there is
a good enougth alternative, man, which also happens to be highly portable
(highly portable in that I don't have to recompile info for every system.
man is already included.)  As for the better readers I really haven't seen
anything other than info for text mode, who's user interface quite frankly
sucks.  Its too bad they haven't taken lynx's user interface, which is much
better constructed.

    I have seen man with much more than 10 pages work quite fine on my
system.  Older systems with older versions of man or proprietary mans like
whats included in SCO or Sun you may have a point.

If you don't mind lynx style formatting.  Perfectly fine for documentation.
lynx -dump file.html | enscript --output=file.ps -
or for printing to printer p1
lynx -dump file.html | enscript --printer=p1 -
or for the quick and dirty approach for graphical HTML.  If you don't mind
keeping a machine around with the evil empire's OS and you want to just
print the HTML you could also quickly and easily create a server program in
Delphi using Borland's HTML component and print and/or convert the documents
by sending them to that server for processing through a Perl script.  Delphi
and/or VB can also do this task by linking to the IE browser component or by
talking to netscape (or IE) thru DDE, OLE, or the crappy and unstable
registry entries.  In Windows netscape has a command line parameter to send
pages to the printer 'netscape /print("htmldoc")', perhaps something similar
exists in Netscape for Linux.  Its not the above, I already tried it.
