	No.
	We've been over this in several lists and there are more
issues here.  The Computone driver is ttyF%d / tts/F%d cuf%d / cua/F%d.
If I understand your convention (and maybe I do not) then the cuf
driver would be what?  Expanded to cuf/42 with devfs and cuf42 without?
That's what it use to be and that created a problem in userland.  The
trouble there is the problem with conventional lock files under
/var/lock which only use the base name of the device name so cua/42
and cuf/42 both have the same lock file of /var/lock/LCK..42 and
would collide.  Yes we could ALSO change ALL the user space applications
using locks, but I just got done changing the Computone driver to conform
to the non-conflicting convention that had been agreed to.  This also
impacts the USB ACM driver and it's devices and lock files.
	Unfortunately, the basenames need to be non-conflicting in flat
name space due the the indeterminant pile of applications which are going
to require non-conflicing lock files under a convention that days back to
before Linux or even Taylor UUCP (HDB UUCP used a similar locking scheme).
That includes pppd, slip, uucp, minicom, cu, ecu, tip, mgetty, etc, etc...

	Other drivers which are not under ttyS%d don't make to tts/%d.
As things stand right now, ttyF%d maps to tts/F%d.  It use to be mapped
under ttf/%d but this created a lock file conflict with the tts/%d and
usb/acm/%d devices and had to be changed.
