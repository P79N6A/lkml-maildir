Subject: Multipath routing changes? "[kernel] Badness in dst_release at include/net/dst.h:154"

Hi all,
This is regarding an external patch to enable routing over multiple network
connections, but I'm wondering if it's revealing another problem:
Up to 2.6.10 and the corresponding patch here:
(
http://www.ssi.bg/~ja/#routes-2.6
) allowed me to combine cable and DSL
Internet connections. 2.6.11/12/13 (stock kernel from kernel.org + patch
from that URL) all give errors such as (from 2.6.13):
        Sep  6 22:51:08 [kernel] Badness in dst_release at
include/net/dst.h:154
            - Last output repeated 15 times -
...with occasional lines like this:
        Sep  6 22:54:02 [kernel]  [<c03748ac>] __kfree_skb+0xec/0x100
Other than the error messages the system seems to run fine, but it only uses
one of the two Internet connections. Rebooting to 2.6.10 makes the problem
go away and the traffic is balanced over both connections again.
I've emailed the patch maintainer and he mentioned recent kernels have
change multipath routing code and few other people have reported this
problem. I realize since it's an external patch it's not your job to figure
it out, but I thought I'd post my log entries in case I'm seeing a legit
kernel error message.
Regards,
   Mike
