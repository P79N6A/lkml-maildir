In the code on list, nothing.  Evgeniy Polyakov pointed out that I
grabbed my marks at the wrong time.

The corrected idea is that while under the i_lock I call
fsnotify_get_mark() on every inode mark that I am moving to the
free_i_list.  When #3 races it actually does all of the cleanup,
including setting the "freeme" flag.  But it won't be able to get the
refcnt down to 0.  Once we finish 'cleaning up,' we call put on the
object and the refcnt will actually go to 0 and be freed.
The memory can't be freed as long as it is on a free_{i,g}_list.
