The problem is, it is hard to get the /proc/<pid>/maps file because the crashes are just random. 
If I set  /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space back to 1, and do a make -j4 on the kernel source. 
gcc will start to segfault or cause protection errors. I added a printk in the randomize_stack_top function
just to print the pid and the random_variable (yes it is silly but...), the problem went away.
I tried to capture the /proc/<pid>/maps for the broken apps using the code below (it captures some, but it is brain dead),
but the problem goes away.  I'll try to write a bash script that does the same and test.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        pid_t child;
        child = fork();
        if(child == 0) {
                execvp("/usr/bin/g++", argv);
        }
        else if (child > 0) {
                char* name = new char[256];
                sprintf(name,"/proc/%ld/maps", child);
                ifstream in(name);
                delete[] name;
                ofstream out("/home/bongani/log/procs.txt", ofstream::app);
                name = new char[4096];
                out<<"--------------------------------------------"<<"\n";
                out<<"g++("<<child<<")"<<"\n";
                while(!in.eof()) {
                        in.getline(name, 4096);
                        out<<child<<" "<<name<<"\n";
                }
                out<<"----------------------------------------------"<<endl;
                do {
                }
                while(child != wait(NULL));
                delete[] name;
        }
        else {
                printf("fork failed");
        }
        return 0;
}
