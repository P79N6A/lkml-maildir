The current code is obsufcated, see the pages-1 stuff and co.
Please change it.

Then fixup remap_pfn_range (or rather add a new _node variant).  The
current code relies on deep magic to work and could be broken by a new
kernel release easily.

That comment doesn't make sense at all to me.  exports what to what other
users.  And through what way.  Please bring this issue up on the ia64
list again.  (also please post this patch to linux-ia64, too)
Jes, is it just me or are you trying to chicken out on all the real
problems? :-)
