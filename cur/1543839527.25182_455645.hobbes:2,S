little exageration detected here.

while they surprized me first, they make the *patch* more readable
by clearly showing what has been inserted and where. However, I have
joined the lines for the merge.

definitely not here. The if() expressions are all one-liners. Adding
a goto would mean two instructions, to which you add 2 braces. It will
not make the code more readable. Patch below is OK. If you have a hard
time understanding it, then it's because it's bedtime for you too :-)
