Why not make this change dynamic instead ? eg : your system boots unlocked,
and definitely locks /dev/{,k}mem once you do something such as
  echo foo > /proc/path_to_magic_entry
So the same config can be used with kernel with and without X, it's just a
matter of runtime configuration. It could even be a sysctl, as long as there's
no way to unset it.
