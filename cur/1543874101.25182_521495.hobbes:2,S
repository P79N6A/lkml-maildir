You need hold and wait for a deadlock. So long as you don't block
(on mmap_sem) while holding i_mmap_lock, then you won't deadlock.
So you could just attempt a trylock, and if it works, then you
could revoke the vma right then and there. OTOH, the patch you
subsequently posted looks fine, so unless this is performance
critical then I wouldn't bother ;)
