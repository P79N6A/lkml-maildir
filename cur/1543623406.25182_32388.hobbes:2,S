The other reason I don't like this is that, at some point, I'd like to
start thinking about userspace cooperating with the kernel on memory
management.  UML looks like a perfect place to start since it's essentially
identical to the host making it easier for the two to bargain over memory.
Having UML react sanely to unbacked pages is a step in that direction, having
UML preemptively grab all the memory it could ever use isn't.
