Get 2.2.12, anything between 2.2.6 and 2.2.11 did not make more than
two days uptime here on a similar setup. Since running 2.2.12, all
these problems are gone. I have 22 days uptime now.
BTW: I have seen the 1s-ping-time bug, too, on 2.2.12 with an Intel
EtherExpress Pro, short after restarting the network with the
/sbin/init.d/network scripts (Suse 6.2 distribution). Down/up'ing the
interface fixed it for a while. The problem re-appeared after several
hours and I had to reboot.
