Was my first patch to the kernel, sorry. However I still have trouble 
reenabling the card. It is recognized again (Withouth the driver thinks 
EEPROM is wrong).
tx is ok, but rx doesn't work. I suppose it's an interrupt problem, as the 
interrupt doesn't increase on rx. Will dig into it a bit further..
regards
Alex
