This could work, but it is less clear and if you run around trying to
extract documentation from every C file in the kernel, which I asume
is the idea, then the Makefile doesn't know what documentation to
delete and what not to.
I am not against putting auto extractable documentation in the code,
but I think it would be safer to put the output in a seperate
directory and not mix it with static files.
