The problem I see with this approach is that "a lot of people" scales
far better than Linus.
Saving 100 people a day of work by offloading it to Linus is quite an
optimisation, but it doesn't optimize the overall development speed.
Let the crowd build the kernel, see the breakage and fix it up, until
we get back to -preX and -rcY kernels.
