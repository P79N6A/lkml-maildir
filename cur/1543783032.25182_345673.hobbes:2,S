Weird. These two lines in your patch (in ide-lib.c):
        printk("%s: %s: status=0x%02x { ", drive->name, msg, stat);
        printk("%s: %s: status=0x%02x { ", drive->name, msg, stat);
have "dUmMy=" instead of "status=", a freshly unpacked
linux-2.6.13.tar.bz2 tree has "status=" there, unless I'm making some
stupid mistake (could be).
