I don't believe this is correct.  mmiowb() does not guarantee that
writes have completed -- they may still be pending in a buffer in a
bridge somewhere.  The _only_ effect of mmiowb() is to make sure that
writes which have been ordered between CPUs using some other mechanism
(i.e. a lock) are properly ordered by the rest of the system.  This
only has an effect systems like very large ia64 systems, where (as I
understand it), writes can pass each other on the way to the PCI bus.
In fact, mmiowb() is a NOP on essentially every architecture.
