   Coming to the shmctl(IPC_SET) problem, doesn't gcc pad out the
   structure elements on 64 bit compiles to long (8 byte) sized? For
   shmid_ds, the first field "shm_perm" fits in 2 longs, the old
   "shm_segsz" would have taken up a long too, so all elemtns from
   "shm_atime" would have had their offsets preserved. What am I
   assuming wrong here?
Endianness.
