To put some numbers on things, building 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 for arch=ia64,
with gcc 3.3.2, using sn2_defconfig, I see the following kernel text
byte costs:
	Enabling CONFIG_CPUSETS:   22384   (22028 cpuset.o, 356 hooks)
	The  bitmap list UI:        1552
	                           -----
	Total:                     23936
The bitmap list user interface is a fairly small part of the total.
Of the 22384 for CONFIG_CPUSETS, 22028 bytes is in kernel/cpuset.o and
the remaining 356 for the cpuset kernel hooks (which are essentially
zero if CONFIG_CPUSETS is disabled).

I agree.  If anyone can see further opportunities to trim, let me know.

I agree.

Yeah !!
