I've used up to 13,3 MHz on my 386DX40, but it was way out of spec and
I had to use a lower PIO mode to compensate. IIRC, one of my cards forced
me to settle for 10 MHz. Wikipedia claims there were systems having
16 MHz ISA bus, and systems underclocking themselves when accessing ISA.
I remember having optional and mandatory waitstates, too, but I'm not
100 % sure it was on ISA. I think they were ...
But overclocking is not the problem for udelay, it would err to the safe 
side. The problem would be a BUS having < 8 MHz, and since the days of 
80286, they are hard to find. IMO having an option to set the bus speed
for those systems should be enough.
