How would that work?
IMHO The linker cannot help with virtual to physical address translations. 
A linker that will link per processor would be amazing. What happens if 
the process is rescheduled? We dynamically relink to the new processor?
I thought you had some funky segment registers on i386 and x86_64. Cant 
they be switched on context switch? If an inc/dec could work relative to 
those then you would not need a virtual mapping.
