Sure it can. The patch still works in 2.0.36 (but the way I made it so is 
ugly), and I'm not upgrading to 2.1 in the meantime:-) With the ..
semantic broken (by the symlink) that's useless. Plus, I have the need to
loopback mount various pieces of my filesystem into my anonymous ftp area.
Creating a symlink not only isn't useful, it doesn't work.
