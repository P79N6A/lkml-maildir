Is this true? It seems to me that the 'on-demand execution units' would
simply be devoted to the one task, resulting in zero loss.
I see hyperthreading becoming a problem if two threads are scheduled to
execute at the same time before the operating system, and if they each
need access to the same execution units at the same time.
