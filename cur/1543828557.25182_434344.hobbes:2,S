This is entirely dependent on the CPU type. Intel CPUs for years would
shut down on over-temperature (the THERMTRIP signal). Pentium 4s will
additionally throttle the CPU clock before reaching that temperature.
Older AMD CPUs like that Athlon MP indeed had no internal temperature
limiting - if there was any it was part of the motherboard, which often
responded too slowly such that it was indeed possible to smoke
(literally) CPUs if the heatsink fell off. Athlon 64/Opteron CPUs will
shut down on exceeding a critical temperature.

cpu_relax likely doesn't save a whole lot of power, I wouldn't think..
However, at least in the first case that was pointed out, halt() is
called first, the loop only is there in case the halt() somehow exits
for some reason.
