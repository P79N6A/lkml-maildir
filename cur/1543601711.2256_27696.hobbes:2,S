I have the APIC option enabled in my configuration.
When compiling 2.4.10-pre12, the call to IO_APIC_init_uniprocessor in
init/main.c is not resolved.  In fact, searching for this symbol, I
didn't find it anywhere else in the kernel source.
(I didn't have this problem with 2.4.10-pre11.)
Best regards,
Mikael
