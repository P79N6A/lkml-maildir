There is no difference from a user's point of view between a "short 2.7"
and "a close -mm tree."  Either way devfs is on death row, because it's
buggy and unmaintained.  Any piece of code, *especially* one as invasive
as devfs, which is buggy and unmaintained is a hassle to for *all* kernel
development, and have to be extricated at some point.
