Nope.
Changing password to a password of similar complexity every 10 seconds
doesn't make it much less likely to be guessed than a static password.
It may mean you can't guess it again, but you generally don't want
an attacker to even log in once.
One-time passwords, using a key generator may be better for other 
reasons for example, more entropy than "31137" or other passwords that
users might pick, or be able to remember.
