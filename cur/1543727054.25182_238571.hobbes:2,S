Actually, I took a shortcut with my PPC implementation of swsusp,
which was to tweak the numbering of PM_SUSPEND_* so that
 PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY	= 1
 PM_SUSPEND_MEM		= 3
 PM_SUSPEND_DISK	= 4
Which has the "side effect" of matching S states and mostly D states
with the exception of disk, for the few drivers that care...
But in the long run, this may add confusion instead of clearing things,
I agree we should rather move to completely different types, though I
don't feel like re-typing every callbacks in the tree right now...
Ben.
