Yes: that should be easy enough, specially DHCP and ip=.

Fine by me: we seem to agree on the basic concept already, and there isn't
going to be very much protocol involved!

I haven't seen much of GRUB, but it does seem to have DHCP support, so it
must have some facility for sending/receiving packets. LILO's command-line
approach would be better suited to this, really, though...

OK, I've filled in the paperwork - we should have a project account
sometime tomorrow. I put the license type as "Other", since the heart of
the project is the protocol, and patches to add support to the kernel,
FreeBSD etc. will have to be under the license of the OS in question.
Title: "Network Console Protocol" for now?
