It oopsed at:
wait_on_irq, CPU 1:
irq:  3 [3 0]
bh:   0 [0 0]
The second time on IRQ 1.
Both times at c010af29
c010ae6c  __global_cli_Rsmp_64576b05
  c010af29
c01464cc remove_proc_entry_Rsmp_d008825f
  c014e1ec
c0180b54 rpc_delay_Rsmp_6ee2e231
  c0180c39
c01464cc remove_proc_entry_Rsmp_d008825f
  c014e1ec
BTW, I typed in the dump, but ksymoops <oops1.txt did not display
the info from the dump (traceback info).  Any hints on that?
(Sorry to be a pain, but its been a while since I did this.)
It also takes a while to boot:  20G IDE and 35G SCSI drives have
to be FSCK'ed....
Hope this helps,

On July 8, 1947, witnesses claim a spaceship with five aliens aboard
crashed on a sheep and cattle ranch outside Roswell, New Mexico.
On March 31, 1948, nine months later, Al Gore was born!
