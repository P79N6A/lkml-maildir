No highmem.  The box has 512 MB RAM.
I get some
eth1: TX underrun, threshold adjusted.
eth0: TX underrun, threshold adjusted.
messages in the syslog - probably around 100 messages or so, but they
stop appearing after a day of uptime or so.  This is two bonded Intel
eepro100 cards, using the "Becker" driver (not the Intel one which I saw
was included).  Those messages do not seem to be correlated with the
pauses at all though.
That's the *only* anomaly except for the pauses, that I see on the box.
The machine has run 2.4.20-rc1 for 5 days now, with an average load
probably around 3 or 4  (load 2 caused by two long-running CPU hogs, the
rest comes from disk I/O, mostly because it's NFS exporting a 147G fs).
Stable so far, but the "hickups" are weird.
