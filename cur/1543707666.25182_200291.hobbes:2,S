i've gotten the same machine check a couple times. it only happened the
first few days i had my machine. i updated to the latest tyan bios which
fixes some bugs. i haven't had it happen since.
if i'm reading it right (which is hard on this small screen, slow cpu
laptop), page 153 of the opteron kernel/bios guide says this is an ecc data
cache exception (which is always fatal/nonrecoverable). this sounds like
errata 86, which is fixed in the tyan bios update i installed.
does msi say their 2.1 bios fixes #86?
