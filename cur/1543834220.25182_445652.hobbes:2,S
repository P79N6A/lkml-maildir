I think having the check is correct, only vesafb relies totally on
screen_info. If you remove the check, you can get the wrong information
from other framebuffer drivers.

Note that fix.smem_len is the size of the remapped memory which can be
smaller than the actual framebuffer length. But there's a fixme comment
there so you probably know about this.

Yes.
