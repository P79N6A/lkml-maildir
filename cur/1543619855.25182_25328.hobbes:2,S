Good idea.  I frankly hate that message as its vague and stupid.  Heh.  I
actually wrote it... but I did it as a patch to an older message and I
didn't want to really change the poetic essence of the function I
modified.
Feel free to patch this yourself.  I am a bit afraid to bug alan and linus
and marcello with such a small change :)
