One more cgroup code review detail ...
The following is evidence of some more stale comments in
kernel/cpuset.c.  Some routines which used to be in that file, but
which are now reimplemented in cgroups, are still named in cpuset.c
comments:
$ grep -E 'cpuset_rmdir|cpuset_exit|cpuset_fork' kernel/cpuset.c
 * knows that the cpuset won't be removed, as cpuset_rmdir() needs
 * The fork and exit callbacks cpuset_fork() and cpuset_exit(), don't
 * critical pieces of code here.  The exception occurs on cpuset_exit(),
 *    the_top_cpuset_hack in cpuset_exit(), which sets an exiting tasks
The downside of my writing too many comments ... its more of a
maintenance burden on those changing the code ;).
