Just tested 2.6.14 from the git repo of today and the machine hangs at
the same point in the boot process.

Yeah, the symptoms are really weird. Let me rehash the whole history:
First, we did some testing with 2.6.14-rc4, _with_ the patch and the
'handoff' cmd option and it worked. Then, several boots later, I noticed
that it started hanging itself again at the same position not while rebooting 
but at _initial_ boot in the morning. Then, you told me on bugzilla that
in my case the patch shouldn't be needed since i'm using 'usb-handoff'
but, unfortunately, without the patch and with usb-handoff it hangs itself too. 
2.6.14 shows the same behavior and the git kernel i compiled this morning hangs 
itself too, as i said above.
To sum up, IMHO, the patch helps partially only while rebooting. Initial
boots still remain hanging so there's got to be something else that
kills the machine. maybe some IRQs or something? The thing is that not
even sysrq is functional, I don't get any BUG() traces or anything - 
the hang is pretty tough. 2.6.13, in contrast, boots just fine. Hope
that helps,
	 Boris.
