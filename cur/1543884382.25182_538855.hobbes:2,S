you have it backwards -- i deliberately chose a wiki to get this
discussion *off* the LKML.  given the traffic volume here, and given
that kernel code removal isn't what most people consider a high
priority, i'm guessing most folks here are monumentally uninterested
in the discussion.
thus, a wiki gives the people who are still interested a place for all
that info, while uncluttering the LKML.  and if some discussion gets
really heated, *then* the LKML can be used to resolve it.
as it is, i think this issue has been flogged adequately on this
mailing list, and it can safely be moved elsewhere where people who
care about it can still get to it.
