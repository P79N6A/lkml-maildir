     Actually your arguments sound like you have a solution to your problem
   and you want everyone to use it even if it doesn't help them. Have you
   some emotional tie to SNMP, like being an author?
After a comment like this, I have no interest in listening to anything
else you have to say.  I've been maintaining the Linux networking for
5 or more years now, and the most important thing I do is say no to
changes.
Franks a lot,
