drivers/net/ixgb/ixgb_ethtool.c:53:1: warning: "SUPPORTED_10000baseT_Full" redefined
In file included from drivers/net/ixgb/ixgb.h:60,
                 from drivers/net/ixgb/ixgb_ethtool.c:30:
include/linux/ethtool.h:302:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition

<--  snip  -->
ixgb_ethtool.c says:
  #define SUPPORTED_10000baseT_Full (1 << 11)
ethtool.h says:
  #define SUPPORTED_BNC                   (1 << 11)
  #define SUPPORTED_10000baseT_Full       (1 << 12)
The correct solution seems to be to remove the #define from 
ixgb_ethtool.c ?
