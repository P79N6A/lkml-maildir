Not meaning to re-open old wounds, but this is exactly why people
complained about dropping the "-pre" kernels.  That was a good way to
distinguish between "the features are in, but so are some obvious bugs;
read the changelog" and, in -rc, "this has no *known* bugs, so please
test and report".
If you want to just go back to that (2.6.<odd>-rcX would be -pre, and
2.6.<odd> would be -rc1), I don't think people would need it explained
to them.  And the kernel.org mirror system already understands it.
Although, as you say, its not clear that any of this politically
correct renaming is actually changing anything.
If someone really wants to affect the bug count, figure out a way to
auto-generate a "bugs and regressions in mainline, by contributor" score
and publicize that.  As the various distributed computing projects have
found, people can be competitive about the silliest things if you give
them a score to measure themselves by.
Since kudos would flow from the author of a bug to the finder as well
as the fixer, it could simultaneously encourage testers.
Quantifying all of this hand-waving is, of course, a non-trivial
project (how do you compare a printk spelling fix to a silent
IDE data corruption bug?), but it would be very worthwhile.
