Hello Ingo,

Yeah, of course, I know, I believe I made a real mess of this one ...

rhetorical question ;-))
I was wondering, Is it safe to use a normal spinlock here, like this?
------- 8-< -------------
	spin_lock(&futex_lock);
	err = get_user(uval, uaddr);
	if ((!err) && (uval == oldval))
		err = put_user(newval, uaddr);
	spin_unlock(&futex_lock);

another rhetorical question ;-))
Nope, I already knew that, that why I mentioned that it probably only
worked on UP...
