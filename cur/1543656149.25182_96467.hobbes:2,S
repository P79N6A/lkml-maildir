I only can to add that I reported basically the same error sometimes
in October with respect to a kernel 2.4.18-17.8.0 used at that
time in Red Hat 8.0 distribution ( #76603 is a reference to Red Hat
bugzilla).  The only difference is that it works for me 100% of
time. :-)
Initially I ascribed it mistakenly to 'gnome-session', as it tries
to play something and locks my machine with an absolute reliability,
and without any traces in logs, but in later comments I corrected
that initial impression.  So far I do not know of any fixes but
sounds like the same "improvements" found its way into 2.4.20
kernel.

I have here somewhat older hardware but in various aspects quite
similar
00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8371 [KX133] (rev 02)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8371 [KX133 AGP]
00:07.0 ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super South] (rev 21)
....

00:07.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686
AC97 Audio Controller (rev 20)
This is a more complete picture of my PCI bus:
