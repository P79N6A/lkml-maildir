Hello
I have some trouble recognizing a SCSI-writer YAMAHA 4??? for 1x, 2x and 4x
speed in linux 2.2.5
The cd-writer is the only device on my scsi bus and got ID 3.
As host controller i use tekram 390.
I compiled the driver for it as module.
every time i insert it, it says: 1 Host
every time i remove it, it says: 0 Host
but the kernel(or the tekram driver) never recognizes any attached devices
So I cannot use the cd writer as a cdrom even i have compiled (SCSI-CDROM, or
somehow similar) within the kernel
At the backside of the writer, there is an id of 3. No cable is attached to its
external plug
curious things:
If I switch on the computer and go to SCSI bios and looking for devices, there
aren't any. 
After doing a cold-start and going to the bios again, the cdwriter is
Does someone know advice?
I have to admit, this is not fully related to kernel, and its no real
ooops... althing is stable, 
Dont blame me for this, better say where to get advice
Thanx in Advance ...
Regards
