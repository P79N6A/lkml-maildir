No, if no paravirt clocksource is detected, nothing can override the
perfect TSC hardware clocksource rating of 400.  And if a paravirt
clocksource is detected, it is always better than TSC.

This patch should be nacked, since it is just wrong.  This is not an
optimization issue.  It is an accuracy issue for all virtualization
environments that affects long term kernel clock stability, which is
important to fix, and the best way to do that is to use a paravirt
clocksource.
