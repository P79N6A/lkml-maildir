Well the most controversial one-stop option could be a by date option.
CONFIG_OBSOLETE_TIME could default to 199201 or whatever
then you could then make things obsolete by wrapping them with
#if CONFIG_OBSOLETE_TIME <= 199805
 /* old stat stuff */
#endif
#if CONFIG_OBSOLETE_TIME <= 200211
/* old uname stuff */
#endif
#if CONFIG_OBSOLETE_TIME <= 200501
  /* uselib */
#endif
Then people could select with one option just to what extent they want
to support old crufty stuff. So one person could go super lean and mean
by choosing 200502 , while another could choose 200000 just to have
things from this century. Most people could just leave it alone.
