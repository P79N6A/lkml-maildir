I don't think you can strip the part about open-ness of the code --
it's an essential part of the explanation. And "any problems" might
be too broad.
Moreover, it would make sense - I believe - to include a conditional
like "Should you encounter problems after ...", as the message, as
it stands in this proposal, is rather scary: It seems to tell the
user to *do* expect problems.
