Subject: 2.6.6-rc2 addition warnings with gcc-3.4.0 and some timing results.

I built the current 2.6.6-rc2 tree recently pulled from
bk://linus.bkbits.net/linux-2.5 using both gcc-3.3.2 as shipped with
Mandrake 10, and with the recent release of gcc-3.4.0, which was built
with all the defaults for an i686 system.
The builds were performed in two separate directories, each made with
bk export -tplain ../dirname.
The times are for a make -j3 bzImage on a dual PIII 733 Mhz system.
Make oldconfig was run first, using the same .config in each case.
The running kernel was 2.6.6-rc2 built with gcc-3.4.0.
Gcc-3.4.0 appears to be a little faster. The kernel builds were run
several times.  The time results were consistent.
A few additional warnings were received with gcc-3.4.0.
