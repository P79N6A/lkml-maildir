Subject: which pci sound card does not have dropouts under load

Hopefully the subject does not sound to harsh.
As stated in a previous mail I have problems when
playing wav files with my sb 16 vibra:
I get dropouts when the system is under some load.
I got information about configuration and Alan states that this
card is not really supported (Thanks Creative for not
submitting the specs).
Thanks for the help to the kernel hackers.
So I decide to buy a new sound card.
Someone suggested to get an pci sound card to avoid
configuration problems (Which is exactly the same idea
I had also, but forget to mention in the mail).
I found in Alan's diary that he is working on a driver for
an ESS Maestro sound card. Unfortunate when I ask in a
shop for this card they state that the card is not produced/sold
any more.
So my question is:
Which pci sound card(s) can the experts suggest (because
the specs are released, there exists a good linux sound driver
and they are sold now)?
Some Information about my computer:
  Kernel: 2.2.2 compiled without modules (no patches) (SMP)
  Distribution: Suse 6.0
  Motherborard: Gigabyte 686BXDS
  Processors: Two Pentium II 350 Mhz
  Scsi - Adapter: Adaptec 7895 (build into the motherboard)
  HD: IBM UW 9100MB
  CD-Rom: Plextor 40X UltraSCSI
  Sound card: sb 16 vibra
Thanks in advance
Thomas
