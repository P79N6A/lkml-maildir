Thing is, I'm seeing that get morphed inside Kconfig to "select MII" in
some cases ... the "if x != n" gets ignored, MII can't be deselected.
That looks to me like a Kconfig dependency engine bug, so I'm just
noting it here rather than fixing it.  I guess it's not quite enough
of a Prolog engine ... ;)
