This works well for the simple cases where the volume metadata is
static.  However, it does not handle cases where the volume
metadata must be updated dynamically, the most obvious cases
being striping with parity, mirroring (esp. the more advanced
forms/features such as smart resync, partial mirrors, remote
mirroring, etc), snapshots, and bad block relocation.
