Hey, let me make something clear in case it isn't.  This isn't your problem,
you have every right to clone away as fast as you want.  So I am definitely
*not* asking you to ease up on bkbits.net.  In fact, I'd be unhappy if you
did, we get a fair amount of stress testing of new releases on bkbits.net.
So have at it.
But getting back to the problem space, it's incoming traffic, outgoing 
traffic, all the web hits (Google crawls the web interface to bkbits
for example, even though we've tried to turn that off through robots.txt
people have linkages into specific csets and then google will follow those
down and up), etc.
I'd love for shaping to be something that would help here but I agree 
with Alan and others who say that this isn't something we can control
at our end.  
The good news is that I'm 99% sure we have a deal for 2 T1 lines at
$500/each and we're currently paying $800/month for one T1 so I view
this as a slight increase in dollars for double the bandwidth.  The ISP
is willing to do the shaping at their end, where it will help, if that
works that means that everyone wins, you guys get more bandwidth.
If it doesn't work then you guys get a dedicated T1 line for bkbits
which is more than what you have now.
