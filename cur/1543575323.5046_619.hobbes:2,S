Done.
It works perfectly fine for me, with the following caveat:
It crashes hard if I remove the card while the modem is in use, though (ie
insert card, point minicom at it, sit at the minicom window while removing
the card).
This is a problem that many drivers have: when the card is removed, the
driver sees an interrupt (which happens to be the CardBus card removal
interrupt, but the serial driver doesn't know that, and the way cardbus
interrupts work it's always shared with the driver).
So the serial driver reads the modem status byte, which is all ones, and
decides that there is a ton of work to do. It then loops forever, because
the status byte bits will obviously continue to be all ones. 
Note how the "rs_interrupt()" routine _tries_ to avoid this by having a
pass counter value, but that logic never triggers because we will loop
forever in receive_chars(), so the rs_interrupt() counter never even gets
to increment.

You should also just test having it compiled in - I know some people love
modules, but there is nothing quite as liberating as just having a kernel
that finds the devices it needs and doesn't need anything else.

I'm sitting here with a minicom session, talking to the modem. Maybe you
have a device that is not a standard UART?

I have the serial.c driver compiled into the kernel, and apart from the
glitch I can _definitely_ talk to the modem just fine.
