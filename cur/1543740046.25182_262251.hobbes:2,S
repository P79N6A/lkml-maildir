Well, I've no plans to rewrite that bit of PCMCIA anytime soon,
especially as my time is very precious over the next two months
or so.
Remember that PCMCIA effectively has its own IRQ router which requires
the PCMCIA code to know which IRQs are physically connected and which
aren't.  Unfortunately, there's no way to get that information as far
as I know except by the published method in the code.
So even if I had time to look at this, I doubt anything would change.
I think it's a necessary evil.
