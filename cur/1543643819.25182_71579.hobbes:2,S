Hi all,
I am trying to build a boot image in order to boot from a CD device. I have
already created all the parts ( Kernel, Lilo and Rootfs ) and try to bring
them together. I first copied it on a floppy in order to see wether I could
boot from it and  it worked. In the Linux-Bootdisk-HOWTO It is said that on
should transfer the rootfs with the following command
dd if=rootfs of=/dev/fd0 bs=1k seek=KERNEL_BLOCKS 
I calculated the KERNEL_BLOCK value in my case and applied the command. It
is supposed to transfer the rootfs file into the same floppy containing the
kernel. I am surprised to see that with a ls-command the rootfs.gz is invisible
on the floppy, though the boot process from floppy works properly. Later i
created an image of the floppy ( dd if=/dev/fd0 of=boot.img bs=10k count=144
as in the Linux-Bootdisk-HOWTO ), created an iso file from it with mkisofs and
copied it on CD. Now I can't boot the image from this CD!
I hope I am in the appropriate ML, I hope someone can help me with this
issue,
Regards.
Eric
