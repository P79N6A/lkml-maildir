Any way of passing this as a boot parameter? Because I also encountered 
this when trying to boot Linux from a USB CD-ROM drive. The BIOS part 
worked fine, but the moment Linux loaded USB support it failed, due to 
the same problem. This is also why I asked if this failure mode could be 
handled automatically.
