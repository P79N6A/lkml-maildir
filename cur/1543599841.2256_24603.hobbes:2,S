I have a question about the status of support for the Apollo KT266
chipset. I have bought a motherboard with this chipset (MSI MS-6380)
and was reading the kernel archives. I gathered that there was trouble
with the IDE controller (running only in UDMA/33 mode) and something about
combining the chipset with a SB Live soundcard. From the Changelog I
understand that a lot is going on, but I would like to know how much of
the trouble is fixed and how much of these fixes are in the standard
kernel.
Groeten,
Dries
