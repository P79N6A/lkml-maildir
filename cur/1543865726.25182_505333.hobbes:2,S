Hmmm, so we issue an async sys_read(), what a get_file(fd) will return for 
a per-CPU kthread executing such syscall? Unless we teach context_switch() 
to do a inherit-trick for "files" (even in that case, it won't work if 
we switch from another context). And, is it all for it?
IMO it's got to be either a per-process thread pool or a fibril approach.
Or we need some sort of enter_context()/leave_context() (adopt mm, files, 
...) to have a per-CPU kthread to be able to execute the syscall from the 
async() caller context. Hmmm?
