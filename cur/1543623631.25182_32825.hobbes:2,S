Greetings,
I have a dual Athlon MP box (Tyan S2460 Tiger MP, 1.53 GHz, 2.5 GB Corsair
PC2100).  The initial installation was of SuSE 7.3, but I have upgraded to
2.4.17 with Andrea's 3.5 GB userspace patch.
Mostly the machine works fine, but when it does a lot of disk I/O, it starts 
to bog down badly.  The most common cause is a large `find', such as those
that SuSE runs periodically over the root filesystem, which has some 22GB of 
stuff in it (it's ReiserFS, BTW).  "Bog down badly" means:
() shell can take several minutes to respond to input
() `top' updates become rare, but when they occur, show both CPUs spending
upwards of 95% of their cycles in the kernel
Although the system can appear hung, if I leave it alone for a few hours, it
recovers and everything is fine.
Is this a known problem with 2.4.17 and/or the 3.5 GB userspace patch?  I
have not tried turning off the 3.5 GB config option (`CONFIG_05GB').  I do
have `CONFIG_MK7' set.
Please CC: me in replies, as I am not on the list.
