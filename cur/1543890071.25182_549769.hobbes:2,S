Personally, I think that's the right thing to do. 
And by "disabling the freezer", I think we should just not call it at all. 
However, sadly, right now it's called from common code. I'll happily take 
a tested patch to split that code sequence up, and try to do it in 2.6.23, 
if somebody has the energy (I'm getting to the point where I may just do 
it myself, but my lazy nature still hopes for a STR person to step 
forward).
