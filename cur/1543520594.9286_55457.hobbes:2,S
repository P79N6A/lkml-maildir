No, you're in the wrong byte order. Look at the header picture in RFC793.
The test checks for the ACK (bit 12) and the SYN (bit 15) bit. 
The old check checks for SYN and ACK both set, the new one checks that ACK 
is set and SYN isn't (other flags are and'ed out earlier) This is because 
the cookie checks for the third packet in the TCP three way exchange, which 
is supposed to be a plain ACK. Check for a syn ack was obviously wrong.
The code before 2.2.11 just used an unconditional else.
In 2.3 this mess is replaced by symbolic flags BTW.
