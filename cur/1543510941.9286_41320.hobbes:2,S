(i have measured this, in user-space). We obviously have no bus traffic if
polling a variable and doing nothing else and the cacheline of the
variable is in shared mode - this is the case after you aquired the lock.  
_Iff_ many processes are waiting for that spinlock to go inactive, then
there is bus traffic to all those CPUs - and only one of them 'wins', so
yes there are superfluous bus operations. The article appeared to imply
that spinning on a shared cacheline has performance implications - no it
doesnt have.

apparently they did have obvious contention problems not so long ago, SP5
fixed one of those. They had one big lock for all the networking driver
code. And there is one more data point, our file and pagecache locking is
more parallel than Microsoft's (at least according to benchmarks),
including NT5. But you are right, i cannot know for sure. The rest can be
decided whenever they put their code under the GPL ;)

yep. Actually there are techniques to patch the inlined spinlock code into
effective no-op operations, so i'd say this is not due to technical
reasons, but rather due to Microsoft's usual tactics to raise the cost of
entry (they want to make the driver API as Windows-dependent as possible).
