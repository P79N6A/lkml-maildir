Actually, it should improve I/O throughput. What it might hurt is
computational performance, but only at the expense of benefiting other
processes.
The reason it benefits throughput is that file I/O is definitely marked
interactive, and that results in file I/O being able to quickly wake up,
dispatch the I/O, and go back to sleep. Its the usual treatment given to
I/O, and it works.
