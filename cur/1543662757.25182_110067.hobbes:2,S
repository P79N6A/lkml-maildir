Manage a list of pending timers, schedule a signal for the next
one (or, if you wish, launch a thread), etc. All that is pretty
standard stuff that can be hidden in some library function, and
you can even steal a lot of the code from the kernel :-)
It would be useful, though, to have something like the
"overwrite" function I described later in this thread, in case
there is a single fd that can accumulate more timer expirations
between reads, than fit into the pipe/queue. (Admittedly a bit
of a fringe scenario.)
