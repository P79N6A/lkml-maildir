Somewhere in there is a changelog trying to get out.
It's quite important to explan things like this: what the feature is *for*,
why we want it in Linux, what it value is to our users, stuff like that. 
Things with which we can justify the additional overhead/maintenance cost,
etc.
So please, include a full changelog in v2?

The cleanup code at out_free() could, I think, just be a call to
free_argv_array().

heh.  More than 100 patches is getting largeish.

Well if you have mutiple patches hitting on the same area it would be
better to present it as a sequence-number patch series which all tells a
nice story.  Start out describing the end-point and what value it all adds,
follow that up with the various bits of implementation.
Dribbling in various related patches at one-per-day makes it all a bit hard
to follow and manage.
