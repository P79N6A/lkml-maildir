at least for the Tecra 750/780 you can cycle though these 3 power modi
(fast/economy/user settings) using Fn-F2.

would be `nice to have';)  but how/when do check/realize that you
have to recalibrate your delay loop ?  all real time clock sources 
are pretty slow/bad and have slow access, and most likely rdtsc 
will be clocked down too:(
