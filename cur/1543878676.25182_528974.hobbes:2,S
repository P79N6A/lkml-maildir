The internode line size yes.  But Suresh is using ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp,
which uses SMP_CACHE_BYTES (L1_CACHE_BYTES).  So this does not align the 
per-cpu variable to 4k.  However, if the motivation for this patch was 
significant performance difference, then, the above padding needs to be on 
the internode cacheline size using ____cacheline_internodealigned_in_smp.
____cacheline_internodealigned_in_smp aligns a data structure to the
internode line size, which is 4k for vSMPowered systems and L1 line size 
for all other architectures.
As for the (linesize-4 * NR_CPUS) wastage, maybe we can place the cacheline 
aligned per-cpu data in another section, just like we do with 
.data.cacheline_aligned section, but keep this new section between
__percpu_start and __percpu_end?
