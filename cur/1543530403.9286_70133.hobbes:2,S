Andrea,
I think the lost_ticks accounting in gettimeofday  can be slightly wrong
in the presence of ntp, thus beating the purpose of ntp. Instead of
fixed size tick = 1000000/HZ we should be using tick+time_adjust_step
from update_wall_time_one_tick() in timer.c. This solution can be wrong
if there were many lost ticks, and it is slightly off because of
possible additional coorection from time_phase. 
Also, I still don't understand how lost_ticks can be >1. What can
inhibit bh from running between two ticks?
Boris
