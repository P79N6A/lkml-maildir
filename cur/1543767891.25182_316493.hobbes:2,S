Isn't this adding them to *both* lists in the lt_prio
case? I don't understand what do you want to accomplish
in this case.
[like for example, if the list is empty and you add one,
it will start a new node_list, but you have also added
it to the head's prio_list] 
If you ware changing the operational mode, can you please
explain your change in more detail?
It could also be I have *the* headache...but hey :)
