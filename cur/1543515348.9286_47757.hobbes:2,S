Thanks for the clarification.
Does it always implement /dev/pts?  Can I assume that /dev/pts is
available and working correctly if devfs is available?

Ok.

IMHO that's even more ugly.  We're discussing the getpt call which
returns just the fd of the master.
Btw. has anybody looked at the problematic situation and can confirm
whether this is a bug in devpts or not?
Andreas
P.S. From the GNU manual:
 - Function: int getpt (void)
     The `getpt' function returns a new file descriptor for the next
     available master pseudo-terminal.  The normal return value from
     `getpt' is a non-negative integer file descriptor.  In the case of
     an error, a value of -1 is returned instead.  The following
     `errno' conditions are defined for this function:
    `ENOENT'
          There are no free master pseudo-terminals available.
     This function is a GNU extension.
