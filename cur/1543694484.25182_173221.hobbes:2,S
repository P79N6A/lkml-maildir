Not sure what's up here. The driver is quite passive regarding
the mode for other VCs, it sort of expect the fbcon layer do pick up
the default mode and use it for other consoles. I'm not sure what's
wrong here.
In a more general way, I really lack the ability to change the console
size with fbset like I could do with 2.4. I don't know if James revived
that feature in his latest patches though. The stty thing isn't very
reliable imho. Especially on monitors that don't like the standard
modedb.

I have to see what I'll do of these parameters first. For now, the
driver only really use the first head. I haven't yet implemented support
for the second one, though it's on my list of things to do.

Well... /proc is evil :)
