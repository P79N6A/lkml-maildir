When I ran into this problem last I tried to press Ctrl-A through
Ctrl-\ to see what happens. All of them display except for Ctrl-C,
Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-\, so they do have their meanings, just don't send
signals.
I thought this was because process 1 is special (isn't there a kill
protection for init?); next I'll try the /dev/tty1 trick.
