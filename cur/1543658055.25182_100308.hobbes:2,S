I fully agree, I was just proposing a "simple" solution that would fit
in a feature-frozen kernel ;)
Note that if we go the full way abstracting interrupts, then the
interrupt "tree" should be separate from the device tree. The interrupt
"parent" of a device may not be (and is not in a whole lot of cases I
have to deal with on pmacs and embedded) the "bus" parent of a given
device.
I suppose there may be similar "issues" with x86 PCI chips routed to
legacy irqs, but then, I'm completely unfamiliar with the story of
interrupt routing on x86's...
on pmacs, all interrupts end up in a single interrupt controller located
in a "combo" ASIC along with other devices. This ASIC is a PCI device,
but is really the root of the interrupt tree just below the CPU itself,
regardless of the actual interrupt sources beeing located on other PCI
busses or not. On embedded, the design can be as funky as a HW designer
can imagine...
Do you think this is still 2.5 work ?
