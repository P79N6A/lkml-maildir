Ok. The unmerged Xen case.
I have some pending patches that make a bzImage a ET_DYN executable.
Would that be interesting to you?  Especially if that would just mean
your initial page tables got to set physical == virtual?
I believe Xen does expose the actual physical addresses to the guest.
Either that or this is a case where Xen probably needs to take a
different path in the build system.
