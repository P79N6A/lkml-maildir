So, it seems at least one time not enough (or maybe it would be better
to write this 1 time only, but in Documentation/).

How often "common" developer has to make such decisions in Kconfig?
Probably no more than once per year. So, it's fair to blame anybody
for not reading lkml to find if there are some bugs or
recommendations before using apparently simple tool? I think there
is usually some README for such things (maybe in Documentation/)?
Thanks,

PS: if it's so easy and it's enough to read only 64592 lkml messages,
I wonder why Andrew, who knows all lkml, and reads more messages per
hour, cared to remember mainly one short conclusion...
