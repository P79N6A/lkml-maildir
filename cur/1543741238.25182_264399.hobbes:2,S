I apologize, yes, a waste of time.  A good idea a year or few ago,
but now too late.  Reiser4's drop_page has to unlock the page between
removing it from page cache and doing the page_cache_release - as it
correctly did before my patches interfered.  And it would be highly
inappropriate for me to be forcing reiser4 to do this some other way.
So, sorry, please just ignore/revert my delete_from_page_cache patches.
