Actually it is
In the 2.4 case we took  "50% RAM + swap" as the safe sane world 'never
OOM kill' and to all intents and purposes it works. We also had a 100%
paranoia mode.
When it was ported to 2.6 (not by me) whoever did it very sensibly made
the percentage tunable and removed "mode 3" since its mode 2 0% ram and
can be set that way.
