Bonjour a Tous,
	Found something weird today.
	I upgrade (yesterday) 2 hosts to 2.2.14, NFS stopped to work (reading directory
	contents or reading file)!
	The firewall trace show up
Mar 19 21:01:58 hostV kernel: Packet log: input REJECT eth0 PROTO=17 X.Y.Z.T:65535 Z.Y.Z.V:65535 L=624 S=0x00 I=14849 F=0x00B9 T=64 (#21)
	So, seems there is now a new UPD protocol line using port 65535 for
	NFS.
	OK!, lets adjust the firewall to add a rule (on X.Y.Z.V)
ipchains -A input -i eth0 -p udp -s X.Y.Z.T/32 65535 -d  Z.Y.Z.V/32 65535 -j ACCEPT -l
	No luck.... the only way is to say
ipchains -A input -i eth0 -p udp -s X.Y.Z.T/32 0:65535 -d  Z.Y.Z.V/32 0:65535 -j ACCEPT -l
	Which is not really a protection :-}}.
	What am I missing here?, do we have a real problem standing between
	ipchain and kernel using service 65535?
	BTW, I checked /proc/net/ip_fwchains, and the rule was really 
	inside (so ipchains (1.3.8, 27-Oct-1998) seems not guilty...)
	Thanks for any hints.
	
A bientot
