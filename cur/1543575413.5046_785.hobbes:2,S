Several times now, at seemingly random intervals, my computer has frozen
solid.  The computer was not under high load--XMMS playing and my typing
an email in mutt.  X was frozen, the soundcard played the same sound
repeatedly, and ctrl+alt+del did nothing.  SysRq, however, caused the
computer to reboot.  Not just SysRq+b, but also SysRq+s.  This has
happened at least 3 times.  The system is a AMD-K6/2 500MHz Model 8,
Steeping 12, kernel 2.4.0-test12-pre5+reiserfs, running XFree86 4.0.1
No other useful debug information could be obtained.
