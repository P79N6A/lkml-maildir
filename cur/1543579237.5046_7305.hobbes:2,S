Hi, 
On my dbench runs I've noted a slowdown between pre4 and pre8 with 48
threads. (128MB, 2 CPU's machine)
pre4: 
Throughput 7.05841 MB/sec (NB=8.82301 MB/sec 70.5841 MBit/sec)
70.94user 232.54system 15:17.39elapsed 33%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata

pre8: 
Throughput 6.11383 MB/sec (NB=7.64229 MB/sec 61.1383 MBit/sec)

There have been no VM changes between pre4 and pre8. 
Jens, can be the -blk patch the reason for the slowdown I'm seeing?
