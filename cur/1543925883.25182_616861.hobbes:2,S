My suggestion: regressions.
If we're really active in chasing down the regressions then I think we can
be confident that the kernel isn't deteriorating.  Probably it will be
improving as we also fix some always-been-there bugs.
I think that we're fairly good about working the regressions in
Adrian/Michal/Rafael's lists but once Linus releases 2.6.x we tend to let
the unsolved ones slide, and we don't pay as much attention to the
regressions which 2.6.x testers report.

Yes, that's a useful technique.  If multiple people are being hurt a lot by
a bug then that's a more important one to fix than the single-person
minor-irritant bug.
otoh that doesn't work very well with driver/platform bugs.  Often these
are regressions which only a single person can reproduce within the time
window which we have in which we can fix it.  If we don't fix it in that
window it'll go out to distros and presumably some more people will hit it.
So I don't see much alternative here to the traditional
work-with-the-originator way of resolving it.
git bisection should really help us with these regressions but it doesn't
appear that people are using as much as one would like.  I'm hoping that
the very good 
http://www.kernel.org/doc/local/git-quick.html
 will help us
out here.  Thanks to the mystery person who prepared that.
