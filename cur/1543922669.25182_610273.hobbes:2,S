The class_device stuff is already ripped out in the latest -mm trees and
I will be forwarding that change on for 2.6.25 after 2.6.24 is out.  So
yes, it should be taken away :)
But converting from class_device to struct device does not mean you use
a "device node".  But you could if you want to :)
Other than that, the driver model usage isn't the best, but I think the
majority of the major issues are fixed up now, especially with the
removal of class_device.  Is there anything specific you are curious
about?
thanks,
