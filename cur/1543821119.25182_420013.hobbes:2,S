Subject: [RFC] make PC Speaker driver work on x86-64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have a pair of Athlon64 machines that dual-boot 32-bit and
64-bit kernels. One annoying difference between the kernels
is that the PC Speaker driver (CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR=y) only
works in the 32-bit kernels. In the 64-bit kernels it remains
inactive and doesn't even generate any boot-time initialisation
or error messages.
Today I debugged that issue, and found that the PC Speaker
driver's ->probe() routine doesn't even get called in the
64-bit kernels. The reason for that is that the arch code
apparently has to explictly add a "pcspkr" platform device
in order for the driver core to call the ->probe() routine.
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c unconditionally adds a "pcspkr"
device, but the x86_64 kernel has no code at all related to
the PC Speaker.
The patch below copies the relevant code from i386 to x86_64,
which makes the PC Speaker work for me on x86_64.
Is there a better way to do this? ACPI?
