Why not linux/mount.h?

How about
MS_ACTION_MASK	0x380
MS_REPLACE	0x080
MS_AFTER	0x100
MS_BEFORE	0x180
MS_OVER		0x200
MS_BIND		4096
(notice that it these bits are _not_ going into ->s_flags or ->i_flags, so
there is no conflict with the current S_APPEND and friends). Actually, I'm
sorely tempted to redefine MS_REMOUNT as 0x280 and get a consistent
picture, but that would probably be wrong. Reason for that bitmask trick:
we are out of bits.
I'm not promising the moment when it will get into the tree, indeed - I'll
submit a patch today, but when it will be applied... ask Linus.
