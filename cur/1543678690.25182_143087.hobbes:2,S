Therefore, if Company A "sells" the package to anybody outside the
company then it has to "make available" the source, including people
like the primary developer.
But i think the second part of Zack's reply might not be right.
The company A only needs to make "available" the source. it doesnt
"have" to bundle the source with the binaries... (maybe make it
available on the website or make some such provisions...)
