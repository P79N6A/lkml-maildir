i add a route to the kernel
eg: # route add -net XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/24 gw XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX dev eth1
but after i restart eth1
#ifdown eth1
#ifup eth1
the route disappear,this make me a lot of troubles.i have several
interfaces,and i have to
re-add all of these routes...
Is there any way or patches to make route work like iptables,after i
restart the interface,
rules  are still there.
