With both flock and fcntl-file locking (I have only tried with fctnl on
a whole file) this problem occurs:
If the process A gets a shared lock on the file and some process B after
that tries to get an exclusive lock on the file, process B will block.
(So far, so good).
If a third process C tries to get a shared lock on the file (where A
holds a lock and B tries to get one), it will get it.
So process B has to wait for C too.
And if a process D comes in and tries to get a shared lock that is
granted too, B has to wait.
Why is it like that? Cant incoming shared lock tries be queued to honor
B so it doesnt have to wait forever?
What does Posix say? Where can I get that documents?
Best regards
Anders Linden, Sweden
