Since the command line is logically delimited by spaces, you can 
accidently disable a subsystem if its name appears in any of your kernel 
options following your cgroup_disable= option.  So if you're absolutely 
confident that it wouldn't happen (for instance, if there's no logical 
reason that a cgroup subsystem name should appear anywhere besides 
cgroup_disable on the command line), then there's no objection.
