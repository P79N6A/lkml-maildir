I was away, so sorry for the delay.  The patch looks OK to me now.
I was thinking again about the VGA ROM's and I tend to believe that even if
you happen to guess correctly where is the ROM shadowed, it would be better
to show the _original_ ROM image and deliver the shadow copy as a separate
file. (If somebody decides to initialize the VGA manually by running the
code in the ROM, is the shadow copy any better?)
I think that we can apply the current version of the patch (maybe except the
shadowing logic) and think about these issues later.
				Have a nice fortnight
