1. I know you read lkml.
2. The patches are trival.
3. Having them helps using GCC 3.1, which turns out to be a big
winner contrary to 3.0.xx.
4. I use GCC 3.1 becouse I hate having different compilers on the system
    and becouse I do some C++ too.
5. We have to do it anyway - so what?
6. In esp. ARM seems to be much better off with GCC 3.1 then anything else.
7. Separating __FUNCTION__ out from string const concatenation allows
the compiler to coalesce the storage used for this string in to one constant!
