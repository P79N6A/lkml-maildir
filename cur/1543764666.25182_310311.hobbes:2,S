Hello,
Dear diary, on Sat, Apr 09, 2005 at 09:45:52PM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

that's great. I was planning to do something with this since currently
it really annoyed me. I think I will like this, even though I didn't
look at the code itself yet (just on my way).

Hmm, I wonder, is this better done in C instead of a simple shell
script, like my gitdiff.sh? I'd say it is more flexible and probably
hardly performance-critical to have this scripted, and not difficult at
all provided you have ls-tree. But maybe I'm just too fond of my
script... ;-) (Ok, there's some trouble when you want to have newlines
and spaces in file names, and join appears to be awfully ignorant about
this... :[ )
BTW, do we care about changed modes? If so, they should probably have
their place in the diff-tree output.
BTW#2, I hope you will merge my ls-tree anyway, even though there is no
user for it currently... I should quickly figure out some. :-)

I'll try to merge ASAP.

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
