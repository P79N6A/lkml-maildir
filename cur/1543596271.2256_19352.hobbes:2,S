	If there is no architecture on which
linux-2.4.6-pre8/drivers/mtd/nand/spia.c will compile in its
"pristine" form, then the CONFIG_MTD_NAND_SPIA should be commented
out from drivers/mtd/nand/Config.in to avoid wasting the time of
users and automated build processes alike that just want to build
all available modules by default.  (At the moment, this code is
not even bracketed by CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, although changing that
would not be a sufficient fix.)
	Alternatively, if you will send me a one line description
of each of those four #define parameters, I will be happy to do the grunt
work of submiting a patch to you or whoever is appropriate to replace
those values with module and setup parameters that default to those
values if there are #defined and otherwise will abort initialization
if they are not #defined and no values were provided at run time.
(Or, better, yet, you can do this work!)
	Please let me know how you want to proceed.
