bzzzt.  It's not really a symlink; it's just made to look like one so
e.g . ls on /proc/*/fd behaves semi-sanely.  (Remember, /proc isn't a
normal filesystem.)
You can't apply normal symlink-replacement attacks against
/proc/self/fd/*:  the only way to alter or replace those is to modify 
the process's in-kernel file table.  It is therefore a safe way to pass
the script.
