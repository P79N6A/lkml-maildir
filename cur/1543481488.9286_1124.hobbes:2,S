Simplest version is to make a true beq instruction to be something like
beq <op1> <op2> <label>
ie. branch if the operands are equal, some architectures even allows for
additional hints for helping branch prediction
The beq you're talking about isn't a Branch if EQual at all, it's really a
branch if zero-flag set, aliased for the normal use.
