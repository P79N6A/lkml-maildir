Hello,
As of 2.3.36, I can no longer use the pcmcia modules on my laptop; there is
an unresolved symbol dead_socket in i82365.o.
When I configure for both cardbus & i82365, I get the following list of
unresolved symbols (for 2.3.39):
bonsai:/usr/src/linux # depmod -ae
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.3.39/pcmcia/ds.o
depmod:         pcmcia_lookup_bus
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.3.39/pcmcia/i82365.o
depmod:         dead_socket
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.3.39/pcmcia/yenta.o
depmod:         pci_find_parent_resource
depmod:         dead_socket
depmod:         probe_irq_mask
(ds.o and yenta.o didn't give problems when everything was compiled with the
config as show below.)
