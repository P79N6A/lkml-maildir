You can maintain a hash table that maps DMA addresses back to kernel
mappings.  Depending upon your situation, you can optimize this to use
very small keys if you have some kind of other identification method
for your buffers.
That would be for dynamic mappings.
You were using consistent DMA memory, which I gather you're not,
you could use the PCI DMA pool mechanism.
