Depending on how TASK_SIZE is defined - it looks like everyone else forces it 
to end of memory, except 68k[nommu].
asm-arm/memory.h:#define TASK_SIZE              (CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE)
asm-blackfin/processor.h:#define TASK_SIZE      (memory_end)
asm-frv/mem-layout.h:#define TASK_SIZE                  __UL(0xFFFFFFFFUL)
asm-m68k/processor.h:#define TASK_SIZE  (0xF0000000UL)
asm-m68k/processor.h:#define TASK_SIZE  (0x0E000000)
asm-m68k/processor.h:#define TASK_SIZE  (0x0E000000UL)
asm-m68knommu/processor.h:#define TASK_SIZE     (0xF0000000UL)
I'm happy to learn we are doing something wrong, but I think that we just 
copied the arm/frv setup.
