It becomes a definition of BSD_SIGNALS. If I remember correctly,
they, by default, use SA_RESTART as a flag. This way, sleep()
and other system calls automatically restart after a signal. At
the kernel level, any signal delivered to a process, causes a
co-pending system call to return to the caller with -EINTR. It
is the 'C' runtime library that decides, based upon this flag,
if the system call should be restarted or if -1 should be returned
to the caller with errno set to EINTR.
