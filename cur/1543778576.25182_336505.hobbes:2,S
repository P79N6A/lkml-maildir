The gcc info here (4.0.1-4 on Fedora rawhide) says it means that the
function should be inlined, and no local copy should be generated
ever. This way the build will bomb out when something isn't inlined.
It also says you should use:
   static inline void foo(some args) __attribute__((always_inline));
as a prototype in this case for future proofing (gcc inlining is not C99
compatible!), but I don't know if that is supported as far back as 2.95.3
(as per Documentation/Changes the required compiler).
Side question: Is there anybody still seriously using such ancient
compilers? I'd guess almost everybody is using newer versions, so this
would really be not a supported combination anymore.
