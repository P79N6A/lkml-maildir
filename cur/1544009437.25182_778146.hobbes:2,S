Subject: [PATCH 31/45] KVM: SVM: Set the 'busy' flag of the TR selector
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/8/85

From: Amit Shah <amit.shah@redhat.com>
The busy flag of the TR selector is not set by the hardware. This breaks
migration from amd hosts to intel hosts.
