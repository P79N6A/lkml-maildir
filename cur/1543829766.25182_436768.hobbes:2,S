hello
commit b6370d96e09944c6e3ae8d5743ca8a8ab1f79f6c:
	[PATCH] swsusp: i386 mark special saveable/unsaveable pages
breaks swsusp for me with a page fault in kernel/power/snapshot.c:save_arch_mem()
the following patch makes suspend-resume working again, but some
problems still remain: fan goes on and stays on after resume (same as
in bug #5000). i guess this is a due to a change in ACPI which i still
have to track down along with the problem that acpi is not powering-off
my other laptop anymore...
comments?
