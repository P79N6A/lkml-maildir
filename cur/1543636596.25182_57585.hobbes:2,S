So far I've also received off-list mails saying that it stands for "index" 
(this person cited "the design of the unix operating system", by Maurice J 
Bach, which I have on my shelf but don't remember that bit from), and another 
vote for "indirection" from somebody I recognize as being on this list longer 
than I have...
That's it, I'm going to go email Dennis Richie...
