Yes, but no big issues given ->invalidate_page is fully capable of

How? I Your answer was to have the subsystem-fault wait PG_exported to
return ON... when later you told me the subsystem-fault is the thing
supposed to set PG_exported ON again... Perhaps you really could
invent a proper locking to make your #v1 workable somehow but I didn't
see a sign of it yet.
Infact I'm not so sure if all will be race-free with
invalidate_page_after (given you pretend to call it outside the PT
lock so concurrent linux minor faults can happen in parallel of your
invalidate_page_after) but at least it has a better chance to work
without having to invent much new complex locking.

I think you should consider if you can also build a rmap per-MM like
KVM does and index it by the virtual address like KVM does.
