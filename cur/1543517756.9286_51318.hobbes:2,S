Depends. If Linux is ready for your task depends mainly on your task - your
very general question can't be answered that easily. 
You want to check out 
http://www.linux-ha.org/
 and
http://www.LinuxVirtualServer.org/.
Parts are there to provide application failover between servers, cluster
servers into web/mail farms (or whatever), clustering file systems are comeing
along etc.
It is more ontopic on the linux-ha mailing list too, where we would be happy
to discuss this with you and the rest.
Sincerely,
