Yes, and it is designed (read the "rock" is carefully choosen) for time keeping. 
  On the x86 the "rock" drives the pm timer and the PIT, but a somewhat less 
stable "rock" drives the TSC.
Also, we don't "know" what rate the TSC is actully clocking so we must 
"discover" it at boot time.  This process either is inaccurate or slow (I think 
we use ~ 50 ms these days which gives an error of ~10 TSC cycles on a 800MHZ 
box).  FWIW the problem here is the sync up with the I/O backplane to find the 
start and ending of the measured time.
I suspect that the IA64 "tells" you what its clock rate is.  Right?
