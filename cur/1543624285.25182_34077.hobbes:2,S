heh, I couldn't have given a better argument against a dynamic filter.
I was actually assuming the filter would be a compile-time option, for 
security's sake.  Boot-time option works too.
So, it sounds like you could be sold on an fixed-at-compile-time filter 
that can be disabled at boot :)  I know you don't like 
fixed-at-compile-time as you mentioned, but it's my argument there is a 
class of users that definitely do.  MandrakeSoft would likely enable the 
filter in the "secure" kernel and disable it in the "normal" kernel, for 
example.
