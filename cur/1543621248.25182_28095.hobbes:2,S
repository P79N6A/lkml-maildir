These two changes together result in the fact that there's now a
CONFIG_FB_TRIDENT but if you try to enable it compilation fails with a
  tridentfb.c:524: #error "Floating point maths. This needs fixing before
  the driver is safe"
which makes it pretty useless. Since this is a stable kernel series I want
to suggest that if there's no fix for this before 2.4.18-final to remove
the trident support from 2.4.18 and to re-add it in 2.4.19-pre1 (with
the hope that it will be fixed before 2.4.19-final).
