that depends on exactly what you save in your snapshot.
one approach is to try and save absolutly everything in ram (this is the current 
approach)
if you do this then you do need to use the same kernel for the reasons that you 
list.
however, you could also decide to only save the information about processes on 
the system (i.e. what you absolutly have to) and let the kernel re-initialize 
itself (along with it's devices) then you could use a different kernel safely. 
doing this should also save you a significant amount of storage when makeing 
your snapshot
