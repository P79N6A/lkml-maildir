The first cpu is brought online much earlier than the rest.  So
we just need to setup a table for boot cpu earlier.  From the looks
of it mach-es700 won't work if you compile a uniprocessor kernel 
for it right now.
We need to do this a little later than in mptable but this should be a fairly
simple one or two line change.
If people keep breaking the subarchitectures by accident we might even 
inspire someone to make a comprehensible sub architecture implentation
on x86 one of these days.
