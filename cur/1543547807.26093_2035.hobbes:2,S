Well you obviously never had to deal with some of these companies. I
have little interest in writing a driver for a card which I don't have
and which is very old. I know that Don Becker had problems in the past
getting proper specs out on some of the other Intel cards, I don't
know whether he tried to get specs on the Nitro but I would asume so.
From Don's web page about unsupported boards:
  "No board with an on-board processor is supported, because these
  invariably have a proprietary/undocumented interface. (EEPro Server
  and Matrox multiport PCI switch cards fall into this category.)".
