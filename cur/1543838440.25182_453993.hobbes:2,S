Next thing to try: Can you do the following:
	echo $((0x0200)) >/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug
	ls -l /net/bix
	umount /net/bix
That should print some information about the client and server setup procedure
into the kernel dmesg log which can then be captured.
If you follow that up with:
	echo $((0x0201)) >/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug
	ls -l /net/bix
	umount /net/bix
That'll dump information from the VFS interaction also.  It'll be a lot more
information, and it might overrun your dmesg buffer, hence why I'm asking you
to do the client-only debugging separately.
Then do:
	echo 0 >/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug
to turn off debugging again.
