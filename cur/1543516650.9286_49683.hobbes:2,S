SNIPPED all.
You just need a 'RUN' utility (Just like VAX/VMS). It is the only thing
that could fork() and exec..(). This is not Unix, but could be readily
encorporated into a system that uses the Linux kernel as a core, but
has modified 'C' runtime libraries.
Any/all programs make their system calls through this utility. Foreign
programs wouldn't even execute. It's all been done before and it works
for good security.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
