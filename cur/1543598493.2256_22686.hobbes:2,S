Hi,
I've put up an updated patch for 2.4.9, which incorporates the PCI DMA
changes made by davem and me. Changes since the last version:
- bh_bus -> bh_phys (davem)
- Merge davem's pci64 patch (me, davem)
- IPS highmem update (Peter Wong, me)
- Megaraid highmem flag addition (me)
- Debug print queue I/O bounce settings
- blk_seg_merge_ok -- always make sure that a segment doesn't cross
  a 4GB boundary.
- Set queue bounce based on PCI DMA mask
- qlogicfc converted to pci64 DMA interface (davem)
- SCSI alt_address gone for good (davem)
Maybe some more stuff, I forget...

cciss needs to incremental cciss-bh_phys-1 on top to compile, obvious
bug discovered after patch upload...
