builtin scsi core doesn't matter for this at all, the question
is whether the highlevel drivers are compiled in or not.
modular highlevel driver(s)
	simples postinst in old-style modules.conf (or some rusty equivalent)
builtin highlevel driver(s)
	the request_module is useless anyway as it happens before root is
	mounted.
