Indeed for APM at least. If D (default operand size, bit 22 of b) bit is set
then the code segment is 32 bit code, if clear it's 16 bit. 
The same bit is used for the upper limit of expand down data segments,
cleared for 64k, set for 4G.

LDT or TSS ?

Itanium is not interesting, it uses the same format as i386 for
this and only uses the LDT/GDT in ia32 emulation mode. Interrupts
are very different but I don't remember how they work right now.
But x86_64 uses the reserved bit of the segment descriptors 
to define extended GDT entries (and LDT too IIRC) with 64 bit
bases and/or 64 bit code segments (have to download it again).
These entries occupy 16 bytes. The IDT format is different
(as well as the TSS format).
