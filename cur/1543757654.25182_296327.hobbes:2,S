Besides accounting I had in mind something like cluster-wide pid
tracking in userspace with builtin relationship information. A bit of
single system image integration... As I don't have it, yet, I'm not
(yet) a very strong requester for the service provided by your
module. But I still think it's usefull and might want later a hook on
exit, too. (And yes, I can imagine of other ways to get the data
effectively out of the kernel, too).

I liked the previous lean implementation more, but the performance
of this one doesn't look at all as scary as I thought.
Best regards,
