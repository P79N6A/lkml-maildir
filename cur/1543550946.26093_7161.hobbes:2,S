Well, while I had Pete Zaitcev over the other day, we looked into
the problem a bit.  I captured the oopses and ran it through ksymoops
and got this stack trace...
Trace; f001c6ec <do_sparc_fault+308/3ac>
Trace; f0010c88 <srmmu_fault+58/68>
Trace; f001ed28 <srmmu_unmapioaddr+a4/b4>

Trace; fe313e8c <[dbri]cleanup_module+30/67> 
Working our way up, Pete noticed that _sparc_free_io() wasn't aligning
plen properly... problem solved.
While we were there, we noticed a few more problems in the file (misuse
of a #define, and poor renaming of copied code).
At this point, the dbri driver is properly loadable and unloadable...
now it just needs to be fixed... the patch follows...
