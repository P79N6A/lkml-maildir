I would probably go for using virt_to_bus(ioremap(base_address[]))
here.

Hmmm, interesting, I would say same answer as for 1).
By using this approach it should be safe for the boot sequence code to
mangle base_address[] when you have multiple PCI busses and it will
still be possible for ioremap() to do the right thing.
