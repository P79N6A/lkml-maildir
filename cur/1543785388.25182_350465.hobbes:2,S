Well I agree with the analysis, but even given that, we have a linux
implementation problem: We have to get an inquiry response first before
we begin a report luns scan.  An array implementing a W_LUN is entitled
not respond on LUN 0 to INQUIRY with an error, which would mean we don't
see it.
Therefore, I think our strategy has to be when the current probe fails
because of no LUN 0 try a report luns scan on the W_LUN anyway as long
as the transport indicates it is capable of supporting it (i.e. as long
as it has max_luns set at 0xffff or higher).
