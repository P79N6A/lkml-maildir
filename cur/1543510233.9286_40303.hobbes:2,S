I read through a bunch of posts on the subject, and I have seen a number of 
theories that the problem might be caused by a period of inactivity, rather 
than heavy network load as I earlier speculated.  I thought an easy test 
would be to mount the NT box, then physically disconnect the smbmount 
client for a period of time, and see if the connection breaks.  Well, I 
left it off the network all night, and when I re-connected and checked it 
this morning, it was still running!
I also ran a quick test by running a ping flood over the network.  The 
collision light on the hub was blinking madly, and I still could not induce 
failure!
I am starting to think that it may have something to do with the 
configuration of the NT box.  I am running this one as a Primary Domain 
Controller.  I recall from my earlier experience that the machine in the 
troubled network was a Stand Alone configuration.  (Un)fortunately, that 
machine has been re-configured as a Linux box (DHCP problems).
Still trying,
Steve Rhodes

FWIW, it never occurs here when the net is under load.  Generally, it's
just when it's idle, and smbmount dies for some reason.  I think that's
where we need to focus--when is smbmount dying, and why?  Is it a result
of something NT does?  /var/log/messages and /var/log/samba/* don't have
a clue as to why it dies.
Maybe it's a problem specific to NT? Or to NT Workstation?  That's what
I have, NT 4.0 WS SP5.  I don't have a Windows machine to test on (thank
God!! It's enough to have it at work!).
Anyhow, I took the smbmount from 2.0.5a and recompiled it.  In the top,
I uncommented the SMBFS_DEBUG portion.  Doesn't really help, I don't
think, but...
At the beginning of the day yesterday, I mounted a share with the
DEBUG-enabled smbmount, and I mounted another one with the normal
smbmount.  WHen I got home from work, the DEBUG-ed share was still
mounted and up (well, aside from pagefile.sys ;) ).  THe normal smbmount
was out like a broken lamp.  df hung for a bit while it tried to probe
that mount point, then I got the infamous input/output error.  Here's
what happened when I do a df:
Sep 21 08:49:30 reliant kernel: smb_trans2_request: result=-32, setting
invalid
Sep 21 08:49:31 reliant kernel: smb_retry: new pid=19481, generation=7
Sep 21 08:49:31 reliant kernel: smb_lookup: find //pagefile.sys failed,
error=-2
6
Sep 21 08:49:34 reliant kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
Sep 21 08:51:50 reliant kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
The first part, up to and including the pagefile.sys message, is from
the smbmount with "#define SMBFS_DEBUG 1".  The last two are from the
regular smbmount, or from smbfs trying to awaken the dead normal
smbmount, I guess, is more accurate.
I haven't had time to decode what extra stuff gets done with
SMBFS_DEBUG. There's a bunch of "#ifndef SMBFS_DEBUG"s in there,
though...
I'll probably try to attach a gdb to the regular smbmount tomorrow
morning (no time today), and see what happens.
