One point that seems to be a bit forgotten is that driver problems do 
actually matter a lot:
I for one do not care much whether I can abort suspending (I can always 
resume) or whether dancing penguins are displayed during suspending - 
but the fact that my saa7134 card only outputs the picture but no sound 
after resuming from suspend-to-disk is a real show-stopper for me.
