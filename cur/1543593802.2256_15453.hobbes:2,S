Subject: www.bzimage.org: bad intermediate patch 2.4.5-ac9-ac10

We had for an hour or so a bad intermediate diff
going from kernel 2.4.5-ac9 to ac10.
The size of the patch was 800+ kilobyte.
The new "good" one is about 163 kilobyte.
If you try to apply the wrong patch, it complains
about scsidrivers beeing reversed.
Sorry for the troubles.
Danny
