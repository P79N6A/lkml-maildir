yes. We should allow kgdb to look at just about anything that can be 
done safely - and we've got all the necessary protections against 
pagefaults via pagefault_disable().

hm, is access_ok() safe on all architectures from irq context? That's 
the cross-arch equivalent of TASK_SIZE checks normally.

yes, the full function now looks like this:
int kgdb_mem2hex(char *mem, char *buf, int count)
{
	char *tmp;
	int err;
	/*
	 * We use the upper half of buf as an intermediate buffer for the
	 * raw memory copy.  Hex conversion will work against this one.
	 */
	tmp = buf + count;
	err = probe_kernel_read(tmp, mem, count);
	if (!err) {
		while (count > 0) {
			buf = pack_hex_byte(buf, *tmp);
			tmp++;
			count--;
		}
		*buf = 0;
	}
	return err;
}
i'll test this a bit.
