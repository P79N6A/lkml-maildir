  Programming in kernel-space isn't at all the same as in userspace.
  For starters, the context stack is highly restricted in size.
  You can have some pointers for it by studying the way, how
  the kernel-space NFS server works while opening files, and
  doing IO.
  Oh yes, there is NO STDIO in kernel.
