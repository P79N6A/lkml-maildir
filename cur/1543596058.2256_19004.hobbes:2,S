Alan,
I would like for you to take over NWFS if you are willing.  I have dissolved
TRG as a Utah Corporation and I am now focused on a variety of projects 
for various clients related to Linux development.  Novell has recently 
threatened to try to take my house and assets if I post any more 
NWFS releases or MANOS.  
I am doing very well with my consulting projects, but to be honest, 
my family has sufferred horribly in the past four years fighting with
Novell every other week, and there's a very strong chance I will be 
moving shop to either New Mexico or Arizona, since they own the 
local courts here in Utah (all the judges are mormons in Utah Valley 
and pro-Novell).  
There are several areas that need restructuring and work, and I am 
available to answer questions, and assist with technical consulting,
but I can no longer post releases of NWFS on Linux.  My children 
need a house over their heads, and I believe what Novell says about 
taking it and putting us out on the street.  They are wounded in the 
market, and very dangerous at present, so I am trying very hard to 
stay out of their way.  If you choose to decline, it's up for grabs
with whomever else wants to take it over, but you have first dibs.  
If you elect take it over, I will have my attorneys prepare an 
agreement transferring legal ownership to you.  I will retain M2FS
and the clustered versions, since I have a clients abroad who want this 
technology, and it does not utilitze any NetWare specific technologies.
I would also retain IP rights to NWFS to use future incarnations in 
products should I set up in another state. 
I do not want to see NWFS fall by the wayside and not get supported,
so I would really like it if you would be willing to take it over 
and get it 2.4 clean.  
Please advise,
Jeff
