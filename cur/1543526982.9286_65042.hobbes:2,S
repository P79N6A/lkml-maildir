This is Linux. If removable media is in active use O/S WILL play with it
in the background eventually. If it's not in active use then the whole
problem is moot in first place.

If system can not ask user then user must ask system :-) I can not believe
that such talks are going on lkml: do you really not know what happens when
some operation is done without acuiring proper lock ???

We need it IF we want to avout explicit unmounting.

Huh ??? How you can corrupt anything with proper umount usage ? unmount is
EXACTLY command to system "stop playing with my floppy, I want to eject it".

My argument is that it's NOT ok to lose data when "all is done right".
With manual unmount you CAN NOT lose data when you are doing everything
right (that is: you do not pull floppies without unmounting them first).
With supermount there are NO WAY guaranetee that data will not be corrupt.

HOW ??? I repeat: if there are exist EVEN smallest chance to get corrupted
data on floppy when everithing is "done right" it's not a solution. It's
kludge at best.

Since is OS like Linux user is NOT the only source of activity around
filesystem. User saved data to the disk allright. And then some background
daemon spoiled the whole party. With mount/unmount (or rather autofs/umount:
there are no problem with automatic mounting, just with automatic DISmounting)
you can GUARANTEE that data will not be corrupt.
