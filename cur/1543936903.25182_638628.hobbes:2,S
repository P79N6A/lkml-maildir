Where is the reference git tree for this patch? Or, in other words,
which tree do I use if I want to test this patch (I'm afraid the latest
I've ever built, 2.6.19.1, is too old for this material)?
I've also checked
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
and it seems it doesn't have commit that renames mxser_new to mxser.
