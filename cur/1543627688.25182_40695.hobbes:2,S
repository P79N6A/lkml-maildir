This comes up fairly frequently, it might be a good addition to the FAQ.
Here's my attempt at an answer culled from prior messages.
Several people have user-mode network stacks at various levels of
development, but it is *highly* unlikely for them ever to get into
the kernel proper (see the monolithic versus microkernel debate at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lkml/#s15-4
).
Here are some URLs to which you can refer for more information:
	
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/arsenic/
	
http://www.cs.nwu.edu/~pdinda/minet/minet.html
	
http://www.joerch.org/tcpip/

However, for security purposes, you probably do not want a user-mode stack.
You want an extensible packet handling mechanism, and can be found with:
	iptables/ipchains -- the native Linux firewalling tools,
		
http://netfilter.samba.org/
	tc -- the Traffic control program,
		
http://www.sparre.dk/pub/linux/tc/
	libpcap -- packet capture library,
		
http://www.tcpdump.org
Thanks,
