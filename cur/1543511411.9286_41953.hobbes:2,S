It should be included in the 2.3 standard includes. Please send a patch.

The old transparent proxy hacks were never documented, nor did glibc
ever provide any support for it (it was always required to do pointer
hacks with sockaddr_in or declare an own sockaddr_in replacement). The
few applications that support it can be fixed. I vote to kill the old
interface. As soon as SO_ORIGINAL_DST works i'll document it in netman 
(the networking part of the man pages)

P.S.: rusty, your netwinder arrived. thanks a lot. It will be soon useful: 
Russel King told me about some TCP timer bug that occurs on the arm 2.2.12
kernel under high load. As soon as I have a 240V power supply (tomorrow) 
I'll start hacking on that.
