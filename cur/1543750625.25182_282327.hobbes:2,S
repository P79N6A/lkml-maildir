Intel improved the HT implementation over time (there are at least
three generations) In particular the latest "Prescott" CPUs lost a lot
of problems earlier versions have.  As far as I know they improved the
caches to make the cache thrashing problem less severe.

Not on x86 no because they normally have physically indexed caches
(except for L1, but that is not really preserved over a context switch)
HT is just a special case because two threads essentially share cache.
In theory it could help on non x86 CPUs with virtually indexed caches,
but it is doubtful if they don't need more advanced forms of cache 
colouring.

iirc on lots of different workloas that run code on both virtual
CPUs at the same time. Without it you would get L1 cache thrashing,
which can slow things down quite a lot.
And yes it made a real difference. The P4 cache have some pecularities
("64K aliasing") that made the problem worse.
