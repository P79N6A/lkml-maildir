So if you want to invest some time into getting this into mergeable
shape I'd suggest you redo the patch series in the following way:
 patch 1: dynamic allocated irq stacks
 patch 2: make irqstacks unconditional, but allow selecting 4/8k stacks
 patch 3: introduce a DEBUG_STACK option that enables vmalloc'ed stacks
 	  and adds the __pa check.
