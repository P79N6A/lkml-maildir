So let's fix it.  ;-)

Kconfig said:
Warning! Found recursive dependency: INET IPV6 DLM (null) DLM_TCP INET
Due to the "depends on IPV6 || IPV6=n" it's not really a circular 
dependency, but there's another bug that anyway should be fixed:
The "select IP_SCTP" ignored the dependency of IP_SCTP on INET.
Considering that:
- there's no way to use DLM with INET=n and
- INET=n being a mostly pathological case
this patch fixes both this bug and the "recursive dependency" warning by 
letting DLM depend on INET again.
