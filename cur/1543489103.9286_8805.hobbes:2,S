Hello,
I setup my box with a 2.2.2-ac7 version. Before that, it was running
2.2.1-ac3 + some Trond's patches.
My general feeling is that it's slower than it used to be. Compiling
my project over NFS was done in around 19/20 minutes with 2.2.1, and
is now 27 minutes in the same conditions.
I have got as well some 'loss' of the NFS server sometimes (during
a compilation for example). That did not happen before. It is not
related to the server (a Solaris 2.5.1 or Linux 2.2.1-ac3/knfsd
in that case), since my 2.2.2-ac7 box is the only concerned by these
errors (when that happens, data received from the server is corrupted,
and seems to contain whatever is in memory at that time [content
of a termcap file, of /etc/printcap, etc.]).
I am using autofs to automount the NFS partitions. When the partition
is unmounted, it sometimes takes really long to remount the NFS
partition (20, 30 secondes).
Last, here is an excerpt of dmesg :
> nfs: server mbox not responding, timed out
> nfs_revalidate_inode: /// getattr failed, ino=123904, error=-5
> nfs: server balou not responding, timed out
> nfs: server balou not responding, timed out
> nfs_revalidate_inode: obj_INSTALL_SSCHK/QNX4_23 getattr failed, ino=553687161, error=-5
> __nfs_fhget: inode 553688207 busy, i_count=2, i_nlink=1
> nfs_free_dentries: found QNX4_23/RS_Query_report.err, d_count=0, hashed=1
> nfs_dentry_delete: QNX4_23/RS_Query_report.err: ino=553688207, count=2, nlink=1
The servers (balou and mbox) were answering correctly to others boxes,
and I was not doing anything particular when I got these messages (just
a 'ls' or something similar).
Trond sent me a patch to avoid the load of the NFS client to raise
when a mounted server is rebooting, but I haven't had time to experiment it,
and I do not think that it is the case here.
A+
