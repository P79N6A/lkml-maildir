I'm not surprised.  I lifted this code from Sparc, glibc, and adapted
it as best I could for PPC years ago for the 8xx.  I was happy when
it appeared to work for the general cases. :-)
Due to its overhead, I never expected it to be _the_ solution for
processors that don't have floating point hardware.  Recompiling
the libraries with soft-float and using that option when compiling
is the way to go.
Remember, don't mix soft-float compilation with libraries compiled
with HW floating point, and trap emulations.  They are not
compatible and will return erroneous results.
Thanks.
