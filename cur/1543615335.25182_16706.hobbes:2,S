   And I did complain. "Red Hat needs XYZ so we make it mandatory" is not an
   appropriate approach to a problem.
[ Just got back from British Columbia... ]
No you did not complain.  I asked you specifically if it was ok, and
your response was that turning netlink/rtnetlink on by default was
fine with you.
It has zilch to do with redhat anything, in fact I had to ask vendors
first if they could still fit the kernel on their boot disks if I
added ~5K of object code to kernels with networking enabled.
It has everything to do with iproute2 and tcp_diag using it.
Franks a lot,
