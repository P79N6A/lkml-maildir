99.99% of users use one arch, i386.
99.99% of users use one disk driver, IDE.
The intersection of these users is probably well over 99.999% of all
users.
Then probably a small list of secondary drivers varies. Statistically,
users with anything but the crappiest x86 s**tboxen and a tiny subset
of all drivers (arjan's 20) are hopelessly outnumbered.
