Hi,
Got my hands on 2.4 using test-9 tree from fsmlabs.
Looks like for Mesquite to run it still has to have the same patch as
was made for 2.2, attached below against fsmlabs 2_3 snapshot tree
fom Oct 10.
2.4 on Mesquite shows rather wierd behavior, does not accept command line
and has a problem with IDE byte order. I've hacked over it with most
ugliest way
but it seems almost to work afterwards. I'll try to find a problem, when
I'll have
time for it.
Now, that's what I'm seeing on boot:
 1: On node 0 totalpages: 8192
 2: zone(0): 8192 pages.
 3: zone(1): 0 pages.
 4: zone(2): 0 pages.
 5: Kernel command line:
 6: time_init: decrementer frequency = 16.666356 MHz
 7: Calibrating delay loop... 465.31 BogoMIPS
 8: Memory: 30016k available (1224k kernel code, 608k data, 204k init, 0k
highmem)
 9: Dentry-cache hash table entries: 4096 (order: 3, 32768 bytes)
10: Buffer-cache hash table entries: 1024 (order: 0, 4096 bytes)
11: Page-cache hash table entries: 8192 (order: 3, 32768 bytes)
12: Inode-cache hash table entries: 2048 (order: 2, 16384 bytes)
13: POSIX conformance testing by UNIFIX
14: PCI: Probing PCI hardware
15: PCI: Unable to handle 64-bit address space for
16: Setting PCI interrupts for a "Mesquite cPCI (MCP750) w/ HAC"
17: Relocating PCI address 3c000000 -> 1000000
18: Relocating PCI address 3bffff00 -> 1ffff00
19: PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 1 of device 00:0e.0
20: Activating ISA DMA hang workarounds.
What bothers me, is the line 15 and inability to allocate resources for
ethernet card (line 19). Any ideas on the spot :)
Thanks,
    Vitaly.
