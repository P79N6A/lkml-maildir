I should have emphasized the "system that changed" part over the
"contact the vendor" one.
I believe most of us have to deal with time as a limited constraint.
And the issue investigation heuristic that considers that an issue
most likely results from the latest change in your configuration gives
a good result most of the time. Software, hardware, we all do it.
So maybe it's a bad vendor practise to *redirect* people somewhere
else, but it's I think a good engineering practise to work by
*isolating changes*. Kernel people work by isolating binary from
non-binary code. Vendor probably work by isolating unknown
configurations from preferred known working configurations. Everyone
just tries to do what best suit their development environment and
constraints.
