I'd rather keep it as is. We should be doing IFS partition with quoting,
UTF-8 awareness according to locale and locale specific rules on
whitespace. That says "userspace" all over it. 
We can keep this out of kernel which is good - though it reminds me we
do need to fix backspace/delete in the tty layer on a unicode configured
tty to do the right thing. (Extra ioctls for unicode delete characters
are a longer less funny subject though)
