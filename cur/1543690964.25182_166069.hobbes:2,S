actually (not that I was following the thread too closely) I thought the
GPL point in the dispute came down to the fact that as the kernel is
under GPL, you can change the export_symbols anywhere you like (under
the GPL) so you can export anything to a binary module.
To really enforce export to GPL only would be simple, you have the file
that exports symbols not under the GPL (and probably the loader to
really enforce it). Writing the license for that file/file loader
combination would be hard but maybe doable...
