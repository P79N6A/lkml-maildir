Why is MODULE_PARAM() misleading and wrong? I think it's a lot more 
descriptive, and these things are "modules" whether they are actually 
compiled in or not. 
The MM layer is just "another module". Granted, you can't compile it out 
of the kernel, but it has a specific set of things it does, and is clearly 
not the same thing as the scheduler, which is it's own "module".
The fact that PARAM was already used as a name should have been a big hint 
that the name is not specific or descriptive enough.
Also, can we please stop shouting? I'd much rather see
	module_param(debug, int, 0600)
than 
	PARAM(debug, int, 0600)
(see, for similarities, "module_init()", "module_exit()" etc: you don't 
need to shout to make a point, and "module_xxx()" is already the accepted 
practice for something that works both for compiled-in and modular 
objects).
