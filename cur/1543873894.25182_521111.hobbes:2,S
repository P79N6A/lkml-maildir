Yes, that is pretty nice.

And yes, those are nasty points.  I think I'd be interested in seeing 
more discussion on it, perhaps those issues could be worked out.

Nack.  Everyone needs Roswell technology.
Actually, that was not a serious proposal.  I think the effort and 
complexity would likely not justify the gain.  But I still had to throw 
it out, since it is what we use on Betelgeuse.
