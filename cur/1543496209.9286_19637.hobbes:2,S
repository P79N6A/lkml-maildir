A bit more info on this: magic sysrq'ing the PC when it's happening shows
that it's memmove, for which there is no arch/alpha/lib routine, so it
does it byte at a time.  Not the most efficient on an architecture that
can't do byte addressing.. :-P
It's being called from fbcon_cfb8_bmove. (Incidentally, can you shed any
light on the reason that fbcon uses 'mymemmove' instead of just 'memmove'?
There's a comment in <video/fbcon.h> about it.)
I'm recompiling now with an 'optimised' (read 'hacked')
lib/string.c:memmove to see if it makes things any better.  For the
perfect-alignment case, we're doing 12 times as many memory accesses as we
need to. :-(
*reboots*
Yup, it's about 12 times faster now. ;-)
So someone just needs to write lib/arch/alpha/memmove.S.  Cc'd to
linux-kernel in case someone has time on their hands.
Tim.
