I ran over "make menuconfig" and did a few changes.
http://www.dth.net/kernel/config-2.6.23-rc1-git5
It boots, but freezes solid before doing any "work" as a firewall.
I was able to catch boot messages with netconsole
http://www.dth.net/kernel/via_output_2.6.23-rc1-git5
It didn't respond after the last line.
magig sysrq etc, all nada.
Will start to get acquainted with git ;-)
