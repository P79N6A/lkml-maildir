Still no luck.. I took out the idecd.
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
   Vendor: TEAC      Model: CD-W54E           Rev: 1.0A
   Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Attached scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 32x/32x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.12
fred:~# mount /cdrom/
ide-scsi: hdc: unsupported command in request queue (0)
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 64
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=16:00, iso_blknum=16, block=32
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/cdrom,
        or too many mounted file systems
        (could this be the IDE device where you in fact use
        ide-scsi so that sr0 or sda or so is needed?)
