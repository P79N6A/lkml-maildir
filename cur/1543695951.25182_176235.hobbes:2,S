Basically forever, until a read is issued to a range of lba's which starts
smaller than the uncommitted contents's lba, and includes the content in
question.  Or if a flush cache or disable write-back cache is issued.

The problem imho, is a break down of fundamental cascading callers.
Unmount MD -> flush MD
	MD is a fakie device :-/
MD fakie calls for flush of R_DEV's
Likewise unloading or stopping MD operations should repeat regardless of
mount or not.

Given POST (assume x86 for only a brief moment) will issue execute
diagnositics to hunt for signatures on the ribbon, that basically wacks
the content.  Cool cycle obviously wacks the buffer.

erm, I am lost with the above.
Flush Cache is a hold and wait on completion, period.
However, a cache error at this point is a wasted effort to attempt
recovery.
Not sure I helped or not ...
