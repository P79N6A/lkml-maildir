It took me several hours, but I just got done combing things over with
bisect as Greg requested.  This is what git spit out as the problem
patch in the end:
7639e962234c76031d1ddf436def7fd9602be560 is first bad commit

    adjust legacy IDE resource setting (v2)
    adjust legacy IDE resource setting (v2)
    The change to force legacy mode IDE channels' resources to fixed non-zero
    values confuses (at least some versions of) X, because the values reported
    by the kernel and those readable from PCI config space aren't consistent
    anymore.  Therefore, this patch arranges for the respective BARs to also
    get updated if possible.

Please let me know if there's more that I can do.
Thank you,
