Oh, it is my mistake.
I found that choosing CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=m makes
impossible to pass an initrd image since
populate_rootfs() in init/initramfs.c omits
code for checking whether the image is an initrd or not.
But I didn't know CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM is tristate.
So, I have to change to CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y when
I want to pass an initrd image after "make allmodconfig".
Thank you.
