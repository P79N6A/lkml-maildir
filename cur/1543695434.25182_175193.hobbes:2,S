Oops, I meant avg_load, which you calculate in find_busiest_queue on the fly.

Actually, if we use avg_load, I guess it would be 0, since this is an unsigned 
long.  Maybe avg_load needs to have a min value of 1.  Then if we apply:
*imbalance = min(max_load - avg_load, avg_load - this_load)
	     min(4 - 1, 1 - 0)
And imbalance looks a lot better.  Only concern would be an idle cpu stealing 
from another, leaving the other cpu idle.  I guess a check could be put 
there.
