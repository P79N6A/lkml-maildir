Which dies at boot before writing /var/log/messages. So I tried my slab debug
12.3 and of course I changed other things in the config (it was a generic
include-everything config so I trimmed some stuff out) and now its rock solid!  :-/
I don't have a copy of the ooopsing 12.3 config (I forgot to change the name
when I made the debugging one). Is it worth my looking at this or is 12.3
falling too far behind? I see 2.6.13rc5 is out now...
