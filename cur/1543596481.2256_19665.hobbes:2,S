Subject: LILO calling modprobe?

Hey all,
Each time I run lilo, I receive the following message in syslog:
modprobe: Can't locate module block-major-3
This machine has no IDE devices.  when I run lilo in verbose mode, I see
that it is querying all possible hard disks in /dev (e.g. Caching device
/dev/hda (0x0300, etc.).  I am, in fact, running an older version of
LILO (0.21) but upgrading when it is not necessary frightens me.  I also
note that calling lilo on a newer machine with newer lilo (21.4) that it
does not query all devices, although that particular machine is all IDE.
I realize that I can alias this block module to off in
/etc/modules.conf, but I wanted to be sure that this is a cosmetic
problem before I brush it off.  Anyone for input?  Thank you!
