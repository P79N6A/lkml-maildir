Probably not very easily.
But imagine a file has two hard links in different directories.
And two clients issue LOOKUP requests, one for each link.
They could conceivably be processed at exactly the same time and so
shmem_encode_fh could be running on two different CPU's at the same
time for the same inode.

Because most filesystems that hash their inodes do so at the point
where the 'struct inode' is initialised, and that has suitable locking
(I_NEW).  Here in shmem, we are hashing the inode later, the first
time we need an NFS file handle for it.  We no longer have I_NEW to
ensure only one thread tries to add it to the hash table.
The comment tries to explain this, but obviously isn't completely
successful.
