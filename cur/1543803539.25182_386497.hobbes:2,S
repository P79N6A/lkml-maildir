This is already done in i2c-ali1535 in current kernel. So it looks like HW 
issue that can be ignored at best. After reset SMBus continues to work. The 
only question is, should we provide an option to shut up those errors; 
assuming user knows (s)he has buggy controller there is no reason to spam 
dmesg with known issue. Will patch be accepted? I will emit first occurence 
of this error to let users know something is fishy and supress further ones. 
But this has to wait for next week, it is already too late here.
Thank you for information
