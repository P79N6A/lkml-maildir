It is not about doing something wrong at using raw sockets - it's about 
using raw sockets.
I'm not quite convinced the generic network code should warn about raw 
sockets. I believe it belongs to the security-related subsystems - 
netfilter and (or) the security frameworks. [But as netfilter is much more 
widely used, the 'or' is just theoretical.)
But back to netfilter: this is more than strange. The logging is already 
removed from iptable_filter|mangle.c - and left in 
ip6table_filter|mangle.c. The only place in the IPv4 path where the 
checking happens is in nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4.c. IPv6 conntrack does
it as well, but uses another message text:
        if (skb->len < sizeof(struct ipv6hdr)) {
                if (net_ratelimit())
                        printk("ipv6_conntrack_local: packet too short\n");
[ISIC should check IPv6 too ;-).]
Best regards,
Jozsef
