If I return 64-bit values as ino_t, 32-bit programs will get EOVERFLOW on 
stat attempt (even if they are not going to use st_ino in any way) --- I 
know that POSIX specifies it, but the question is if it is useful.
What is the correct solution? Mount option that can differentiate between 
32-bit colliding inode numbers and 64-bit non-colliding inode numbers? Or 
is there any better idea.
Given the fact that glibc compiles anything by default with 32-bit ino_t, 
I wonder if returning 64-bit inode number is possible at all.
