Hi,
I am also doing such comparisons, with IOZone and Bonnie++
The currents results are available at 
http://www.pingouin.org/linux/fsbench/
More results are to come, especially to see the notail option impact of
Reiserfs with iozone and bonnie++.
Of course, comments are welcome...
	Regards,
		Yves
