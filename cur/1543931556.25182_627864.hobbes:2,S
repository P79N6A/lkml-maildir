Yes it would in most cases.  This means the writing case is much
more expensive with them, so if there is anything which is still
relatively frequently written (just not "mostly") it would be 
probably not a good idea. It should be only done for settings
that practically never change.
The other problem is that you have to change all accesses to the new
accessor macros which is potentially a lot. Also you have to add
sync calls for the writing case, which means that sysctl etc. setup
will be more complicated because you need "strategy" functions now.
Also for things that are not that critical the uglification in
the source is likely not worth it.
I would suggest to only do it after looking at oprofile cache miss
profiles.

It should be more efficient because there will be less dcache misses.
icache is typically already prefetched by the CPU. This is especially
useful for the kernel because it often runs cache cold because user
space used all the cache.
