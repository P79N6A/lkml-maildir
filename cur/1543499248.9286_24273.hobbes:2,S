Subject: Kernel 2.3.5/PCMCIA 3.0.12 hot swap problem

I recently upgraded my laptop to Redhat 6, then to kernel 2.3.5 and
pcmcia-cs.02-Jun-99 (and before that 3.0.11, and then 3.0.10 before that, both
with 2.3.5 and with two 2.2 kernels) 
I can no longer hot swap network cards; if I pull out a network card while the
network is up, the module does not unload, and running ifconfig simply hangs
(in ioctl(.., SIOCGFICONF...)) 
At that point I can no longer insert cards, either, until after a reboot. When
I was using 2.0.36/pcmcia-cs.06-Sep-98 this didn't happen. When I get time I
hope to play some more and find out whether it's kernel or card services
changes which caused this, but in the meantime, does this sound familiar to
anyone? 
(This occurs with a Lucent WaveLAN 802.11 card, a ZoomAir 802.11 card, a
WaveLAN/915mhz card, and a 3com/Megahertz 3CXEM556C or somesuch, so it's
presumably not any given card, but I have no non-network card to try)
