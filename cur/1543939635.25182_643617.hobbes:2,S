Yeah, that's basically what 8.1 says.  PAE doesn't follow the normal TLB 
rules for the top level, though they reserve the right to make it behave 
properly (as it would if you graft a PAE pagetable into a full 64-bit 
pagetable).

That wouldn't happen to often though, would it.  The identity mapping is 
only interested in a 1:1 view on RAM, and that's not going to change at 
all?  Does the TLB cache PAT attributes?  Do you need to do a global 
flush after changing a PTE's PAT bits to make sure that all that PTE's 
mappings have a consistent view on memory?
