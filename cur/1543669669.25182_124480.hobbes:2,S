No, you want to make sure you have the same "name" after that.  As any
userspace apps that had a open file on the original disks are basically
screwed anyway, we want a way to enable them to recover nicely.
And no, I don't want to go into the whole, remove a device and plug it
back in, and userspace never noticed the difference while it held an
open file handle.  That's a problem I don't want to even go near right
now, and is totally different from what udev is trying to do :)
