What about using the bugzilla email gateway? While it would be feasible that
bugs should be added through the web interface, why not to automagically
forward changes (new comments, attachments, maybe also status?) to appropriate
mailing lists and absorb the replies to the thread back to bugzilla as the new
comments? Ok, this would require people to cut the Cc soon enough not to stack
100-messages thread slowly evolving to completely different topic into bugzilla
;-).
If there is an interest in this and noone else is overly keen to do it, I would
be willing to investigate this and check the functionality of the email gateway
in bugzilla's contrib/ and possibly extend/fix it for our usage.
