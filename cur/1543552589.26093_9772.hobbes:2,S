Hi
I've got a 486 running 2.4.0-test9 which I am using as a router
between my network and cable modem. I've noticed that ping times (even
on loopback) are significantly higher than on 2.2.16. This box is
doing masquerading for stuff going out the cable interface which is a
realtek 8039. The other card is an smc ultra. The machine has 64 mb of
memory and a 486 dx4/100. 
pinging 127.0.0.1:
round-trip min/avg/max = 3.2/3.2/3.5 ms
Pinging the 486 from a 2xpii 450 128m realtek8039 box running 2.2.16:
round-trip min/avg/max = 1.5/1.6/2.0 ms
pinging a 450 mhz win98 box from the 2.2.16 box:
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.5/0.5/0.6 ms
pinging the win98 box from the 2.4.0-test9 box:
round-trip min/avg/max = 3.1/3.3/6.6 ms
pinging the 2.2.16 box from the test9 box:
round-trip min/avg/max = 3.1/3.1/3.5 ms
pinging the cable modem from the test9 box(this was under 1 ms with 2.2.16):
round-trip min/avg/max = 3.4/3.5/7.8 ms
It's the loopback result which makes me think it's a kernel
problem. Otherwise it's working great - I really like iptables etc.
Regards
