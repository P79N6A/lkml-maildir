It's a purely "make things prettier" patch, so I have no problem with 
that.   If the non-global flags used in early 64-bit pagetables is very 
deeply ingrained, I wonder if its worth making a separate set of 
explicitly non-global _PAGE_KERNEL flags for its use, so that at least 
_PAGE_KERNEL* is consistent between 32 and 64 bits.  Otherwise its going 
to be the sort of difference which gets increasingly awkward as things 
get unified (I guess its mitigated by the fact that 32-bit code can 
never assume that global mappings are available and present).
