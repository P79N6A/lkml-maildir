Why is that hack required in the first place?
We rebuild if:
- target file is missing (not the case here)
- any prerequisite files are newer than target (not the case here)
- any CONFIG_* options used by any prerequisite has changed (not the case here)
  [It is due to your hack]
- gcc changed (not the case here)
- options are added/deleted to gcc (this should be the case for relevant files)
Looking a bit deeper into this.
I see that we have in Makefile.build:
define rule_cc_o_c
        $(call echo-cmd,checksrc) $(cmd_checksrc)                         \
        $(call echo-cmd,cc_o_c) $(cmd_cc_o_c);                            \
        $(cmd_modversions)                                                \
        $(cmd_record_mcount)   
So you want everyting to be rebuild if the command above changes.
That should be doable - and it is indeed a bug that we do not do so.
The integration of record_mcount needs to be improved.
