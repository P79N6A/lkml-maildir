Hello,
I want to learn and know the Linuk kernel.
I read Oreilly "linux  Device Driver (second edition) " and "Understanding 
The Linux kernel".(second edition) "
Theses 2 books are good (even the second is a little bit updated).
I also saw by google search :
"Linux internals"  by Moshe Bar (McGraw-Hill Osborne Media , 2000) )
"Linux Kernel internals" (second edition) by Michael Beck (Editor), et al;  
(Addison-Wesley 1997)
"Linux File System" also by Moshe Bar
My questions is :
For a programmer with experience in "C" and Linux (more than 2-4 years),
what is the opinion of readers of this list who know this books ? 
(especially the first 2?)
Do anybodu know another good book ?
regards,
sting
