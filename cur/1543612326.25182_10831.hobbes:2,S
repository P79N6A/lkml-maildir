Because there are some real bugs in the kernel where code incorrectly
calls routines marked __devexit, a global conversion of __devexit
functions to NULL or weak will hide the bugs as well as the good code.
Most of the bugs are on error paths, typically an init routine calling
the exit code on error.  Changing to BUG() does not help either, that
only shows up the buggy code in the unlikely event of a device error.
Using __devexit_p() will automatically remove the references that
should not exist, the new binutils can then catch the other buggy code
at link time.
