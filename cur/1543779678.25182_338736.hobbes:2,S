-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
powernow-k8 requires that a data structure for
each core be created in the _cpu_init function
call.  The cpufreq infrastructure doesn't call
_cpu_init for the second core in each processor.
Some systems crashed when _get was called with
an odd-numbered core because it tried to
dereference a NULL pointer since the data
structure had not been created.
The attached patch solves the problem by
initializing data structures for all shared
cores in the _cpu_init function.  It should
apply to 2.6.12-rc6 and has been tested by
AMD and Sun.
