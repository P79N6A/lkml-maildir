If you don't care about rate limiting RCU processing (you wouldn't
in CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT), you still have to deal with the situation
that one CPU going idle doesn't guarantee that you can process
all pending RCUs. You can process the finished ones, but what
about the ones that are still waiting for the grace period
beyond the current cpu ?

That is probably because of what I mention above. In the original
CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ, we don't go into a nohz state if there are
RCUs pending in that cpu.

There is no way to finish all the RCUs in a given cpu
unless you are prepared to wait for a grace period or so. 
So, you go to idle, keep checking in the timer tick and as soon 
as all RCUs are done, go to nohz state. You can keep
processing RCUs in every idle tick so that if you have only
finished RCU callbacks on that cpu, you can go to nohz rightaway.
I can add that API.
Of course, you can do what cpu hotplug does - move the RCUs
to another CPU. But that is an expensive operaation.
Thanks
