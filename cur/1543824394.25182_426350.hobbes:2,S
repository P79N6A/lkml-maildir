Subject: [PATCH 10 of 10] ipath - deref correct pointer when using kernel SMA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/23/164

At this point, the core QP structure hasn't been initialized, so what's
in there isn't valid.  Get the same information elsewhere.
