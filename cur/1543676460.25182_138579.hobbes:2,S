   But you're creating a new mapping for the old buffer.  What if you had
   a DMA API implementation which consolidates multiple mapping attempts
   of the same buffer into a single mapping entry (along with a reference
   count)?  That would break the workaround.
I hope nobody is doing this, it would probably break other things
we haven't considered yet.
You can't support all the BIO_MERGE_BOUNDARY stuff properly in
such a scheme. And you _WANT_ to support that when you have an
IOMMU, it shrinks the DMA descriptor addr/len entries a chip
has to DMA for each block I/O considerably.
   Isn't the proper fix to (a) get a new buffer, (b) create a mapping for
   the new buffer, (c) destroy the mapping for the old buffer.  That
   should guarantee a different bus address, no matter what the
   DMA-mapping implementation.
I suppose this would work, fell free to code this up for the
tg3 driver for me because I certainly lack the time to do this.
