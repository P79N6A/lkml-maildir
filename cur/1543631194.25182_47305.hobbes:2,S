I can live with not building, crashing, or even eating filesystems.  Those
things will be fixed sooner or later.  But breaking userspace programs -- that
may well be permanent.  If there was a good chance it would be working again by
the time 2.6 comes out, it wouldn't bother me.  But I really don't expect this
to change, so it looks like I won't be able to use 2.5 (or anything later) until
I get another version of gtop, or fix this one myself.  And so there will be yet
another nonstandard change to my patchwork system that I'll have to deal with
(if I even remember it) the next time I try to upgrade (i.e., reinstall)
Slackware.

The 2.<odd> series, like 2.5 is a strictly development kernel series; new
features go into these all the time.  You can expect it to:
1. not build.
2. crash.
3. silently eat your filesystems.
4. break userspace programs.
or any combination of the above.  If you're looking for stability, stick
with the 2.<even> series.
