I know why it was turned off by default.  The annoying this is that now
the *only* way to activate the watchdog is via a boot command.  It is
not possible to compile a standard debugging kernel with this option
turned on, you have to rely on every user setting the boot options for
every kernel.  If it is going to be off by default there should be a
way to patch the kernel to make it on by default.
