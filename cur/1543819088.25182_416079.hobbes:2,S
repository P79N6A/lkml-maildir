Hi Mel.
It looks to me like this code could be used by the software suspend code in 
our determinations of what pages to save, particularly in the context of 
memory hotplug support. Just some food for thought at the moment; I'll see if 
I can come up with a patch when I have some time, but it might help justify 
getting this merged.
Regards,
Nigel
