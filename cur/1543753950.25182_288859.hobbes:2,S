It's architecture and cpu dependant. Useful timeslices to avoid cache 
trashing vary from 2ms to 20ms. Also HZ varies between architectures and 
setups, and almost certainly will vary in some dynamic way in the future 
altering substantially the accuracy of such a setup.

I wan't debating that fact. I was saying that decreasing the range of 
priorities you can have for real time will lose the highest priority ones.
	if (SCHED_RT(policy))
		p->prio = MAX_USER_RT_PRIO-1 - p->rt_priority;

can I also comment on:
+	while (!list_empty(queue)) {
+		next = list_entry(queue->next, task_t, run_list);
+		dequeue_task(next, active);
+		enqueue_task(next, expired);
+	}
O(n) functions are a bad idea in critical codepaths, even if they only 
get hit when there is more than one SCHED_ISO task queued.
Apart from those, I'm not really sure what advantage this different 
design has. Once you go over the cpu limit the behaviour is grey and 
your design basically complicates what is already simple - to make an 
unprivileged task starvation free you run it SCHED_NORMAL. I know you 
want it back to high priority as soon as possible, but I fail to see how 
this is any better. They're either real time or not depending on what 
limits you set in either design.
As for priority support, I have been working on it. While the test cases 
I've been involved in show no need for it, I can understand why it would 
be desirable.
