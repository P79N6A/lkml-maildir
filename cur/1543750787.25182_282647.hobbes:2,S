I'm fine with shifting the CRs around if it makes everyone happier.  I was
lazy when I cut and pasted the snippet of code and did nothing other than
change the number of tabs to match the surrounding code. This, of course, 
is what actually made the reformatting you did possible.  I've read these and 
similar lines so many times I'm not sure if I'd notice whether or not they
were hard or easy to parse.  Feedback is GOOD.

It's a variable nomenclature that I inherited from the 2.4.X kernel series
driver.  If you look a bit closer the code will make sense.  Remember this:
(1) There are 8 fan divisors stored in 2 byte-size registers.
(2) Each fan divisor is represented by 2 bits.
And the result should be clear.
