If using a central "server" process, all clients have to copy
the message to the server - then the server copies the messages
to multiple clients.
I can imagine a library, that holds a registry in shared mem, and
the clients look for themselves to whom to copy the message.
For this I want to use posix message queues to avoid lots of
context switches and copies.
