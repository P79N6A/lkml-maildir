Same machine details as above, except I have IDE drives, hub and devices 
are USB 1.1.
I experienced a similar problem while trying to boot up 2.6.6-mm5 (hard 
reset was the only thing that worked). I tried booting 2.6.6-mm4 which 
was the previous kernel I had working, that also gave the same bug,  on 
console=ttyS1, I got reams of messages constantly that mentioned 
usb_storage, I thought mistakenly that I had them captured - will do a 
capture when next convenient. I unplugged the usb card reader and 
2.6.6-mm5 is up and running.
Regards
Sid.
