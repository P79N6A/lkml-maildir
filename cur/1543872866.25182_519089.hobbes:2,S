Any data or additional info on that?  Did you discover this by tracking 
the DMA API software routines, or something lower level (like a bus 
analyzer)?
libata handles all the DMA allocation and mapping and cleanup for 
sata_nv, so any software problem would affect the whole of libata.
But it's possible that the nForce SATA chip has DMA padding needs that 
are different from those provided by libata-core (grep for "pad"), which 
could create a situation where the hardware continues DMA'ing past the 
end of the DMA area.
