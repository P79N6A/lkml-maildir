Actually I think these free() checks can be extended a lot, it can detect memory leaks and so on.
I have preliminary working version here, but it was only barely tested (And not tested on real kernel at all).
I will spend more time on it today and then send it in.
Incidentally this new version should also work on non-kernel code too, I think ;)
I think that tracking only negative/NULL returns is not the best way.
My current approach is to add several more states like "exported" which means that this value was added
to externally visible variable. Then upon reaching return/end of function we can see if all the
allocated stuff was freed or exported. Tricky part seems to correctly merge all these states
from different branches of if steatements.
Also is anybody working on "redundant assignments" stuff as described in Standford guys papers?
Bye,
    Oleg
