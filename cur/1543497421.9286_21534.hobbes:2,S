Hi Community,
This is Eddie Wang.
I am new to Linux and writing a Fiber Channel HBA device driver for Linux
now.  The driver is done but have many difficulties on loading and debugging
the driver.
I amd using RedHat release 6.0.  So far I have done:
1, have driver module ready and copied into /lib/modules/2.2.5-15/scsi;
2, added a few lines in /boot/module-info (may not needed) to show 
   the driver name and the module is for scsi_hostadapter;
3, use command "insmod hpfc.o" to install driver.
Q1, I don't know any step I have been missing so far and hope can get help
from the community.
When doing "insmod hpfc.o", A segmentation fault message comes out with lot
of register values.  The print message I put into driver was scrolled up by
those messges.
Q2, Is there any document I can get in order to analyze the problem 
    through those printed Stack value, Call Trace, etc?
Q3, Does Linux has kernel debugger as those comercial unix such as 
    Unixware, Solaris which can allow you to to setup break point and 
    trace your driver?
Q4, Does those message being logged somewher that I can check addition to
    the display on console?
Many thanks!
