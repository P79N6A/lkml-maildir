Based on a better understanding of dirty_ratio and dirty_background ratio (thanks Nate) I just tried
the following test:
dirty_ratio set to 95
dirty_background_ratio set to 1
From Nate's description of these parameters, this should mean that the disk writes
start almost immediately, and the kernel will allow 95% of RAM to become dirty before
applying the throttle.
Ok, so with 25Mbytes/s coming in, and 17Mbytes/sec going out to disk, the dirty pages should be growing
at 7Mbytes/sec. With these parameters set as above I should see about 3 minutes of full speed
video before the throttle is applied since I have about 1.3Gb of RAM free for buffering..
*But* when I try this experiment I hit the throttle after only 65 seconds - an improvement to 
be sure, but still a long way short of the 180 seconds that it ought to take.
Part of the test works as expected - the disk writes begin almost immediately due to the low
value for dirty_background_ratio, but the rest is a mystery.
It really looks as if the pages aren't being marked as clean fast enough after they're written.
How else can it take only 70 seconds to reach 95% dirty when I have 1.3Gb of available RAM and data coming in at 25MBytes/sec and out at 17MBytes/sec? It doesn't make any sense...
regards, Anthony
