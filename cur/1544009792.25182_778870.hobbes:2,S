IIRC (have not touched the driver for quite some time) at a
certain stage all requests for a specific drive are serialized.
The amiga floppy drives read and write whole tracks only, so
follow-up acesses are likely to be on the same track and then
served from the buffer of decoded blocks. I you do wild track
jumping, it is slower than the original AmigaOS-driver.
But as I am not sure, and floppy drives are slow anyway, the
complete_all() won't give any notable performance penalty, I guess.
