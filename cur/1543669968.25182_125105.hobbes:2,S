Thankfully you are wrong or we would have some serious problems :)
See kernel/sched.c :: preempt_schedule() where we set p->preempt_count
to PREEMPT_ACTIVE.
Then see kernel/sched.c :: schedule() where we short-circuit the
remove-from-runqueue code if PREEMPT_ACTIVE is set.
Thus, it is safe to preempt regardless of the task's state.  It will
eventually reschedule.
