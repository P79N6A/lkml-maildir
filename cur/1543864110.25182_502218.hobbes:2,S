Hi,
i was wondering whether there exists any mechanism to blacklist modules from 
being loaded besides the typical /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist type mechanisms. 
Sometimes you have a module oopsing because of faulty hw which cannot be 
removed rendering the system unbootable.
And sometimes there's just no way to edit the modprobe blacklist because you 
cannot boot the box :)
Basically i would like to setup a list of module names the kernel simply 
refuses to load..
blacklist=some_module,some_other_module,some_third_module
Does something exist? Do you think it makes sense? Would it be tough to 
implement?
Regards,
Flo
