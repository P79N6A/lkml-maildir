Ah, wish you were there :)

FWIW, this controller was originally written for f-series. It should
be trivial to put it back there. So really, f-series isn't gone 
anywhere. If you want to merge it, I am sure it can be re-submitted.

I think what would be nice is a clear strategy on whether we need
to work out the infrastructure or the controllers first. One of
the strongest points raised in the BoF was - forget the infrastructure
for now, get some mergable controllers developed. If you
want to stick to f-series infrastructure and want to see some
consensus controllers evolve on top of it, that can be done too.
Thanks
