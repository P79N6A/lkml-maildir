Linus,
You forgot about wakeup_bdflush(1) stuff.
Here is the patch again (against test10).
===============================================================
There are several places where schedule() is called after wakeup_bdflush(1)
is called. This is completely unnecessary, since wakeup_bdflush(1) already
gave up the control, and when the control is returned to the calling thread
who called wakeup_bdflush(1), it should just go on. Calling schedule()
after wakeup_bdflush(1) will make the calling thread give up control again.
This is a problem for some of those latency sensitive benchmarks (like SPEC
SFS) and applications.
