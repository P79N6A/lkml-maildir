If you don't care about preserving user space it is a solved problem.
I have a patch that is currently up to 2.4.2 that works on both alpha,
and x86.  Porting to other archtietures also looks very simple.
I wrote it so I can use the linux kernel in conjunction with some
use space code as a bootloader.
