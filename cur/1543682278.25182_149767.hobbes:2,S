I've applied Daniel's patch to my 2.6.0-test1-mm1 tree on two of my test
systems (a PCMCIA and PCI version of the Aironet 350 series) and both
are working great.  His patches look pretty obviously correct to me and
are much cleaner than the hacked up patches I've been sending out to
people to get the card working on recent 2.5.7x kernels.  Just wanted to
report the success.
Later,
Tom
