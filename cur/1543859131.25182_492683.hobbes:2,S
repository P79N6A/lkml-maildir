It seems the highest speed here is UDMA/133.  That should be right...
I've let this go for now; except someone just brought up that copying
from one SATA drive to another slows Ubuntu to a crawl (which is what
I'm using, hence my dmesg should be relevant).  On my end I'm not
noticing; VLC used to hang the system horribly while trying to read like
20M videos (hard disk light on the whole time), now it behaves.
