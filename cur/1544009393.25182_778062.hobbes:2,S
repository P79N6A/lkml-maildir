heh.  Here's the problem...
The first patch which was added (pre-2.6.27) was "percpu_counter: new
function percpu_counter_sum_and_set".  This added the broken-by-design
percpu_counter_sum_and_set() function, **and used it in ext4**.
Later, during 2.6.28 development came the "percpu counter: clean up
percpu_counter_sum_and_set()" which propagated the
percpu_counter_sum_and_set() brokenness into percpu_counter_sum() as
well.
If we were to now merge your simple dont-modify-the-percpu-counters fix
then this would break ext4, because of the **and used it in ext4**,
above.
You see, ext4 stopped using the accurate/slow percpu_counter_sum() and
switched to percpu_counter_sum_and_set() because this new function
increases the accuracy of percpu_counter_read() in other parts of ext4.
Also, e8ced39d5e8911c662d4d69a342b9d053eaaac4e ("percpu_counter: new
function percpu_counter_sum_and_set") replaced a call to
percpu_counter_sum_positive() with a call to
percpu_counter_sum_and_set(), but there's nothing which prevents
percpu_counter_sum_and_set() from returning negative values, afacit.
