Since each mapping has its own vm_area, I don't see the problem.
Do you want different mappers to share read-ahead info?

Sorry I don't quite understand what you want here.  If you want to share
read-ahead info between different mappers, struct file isn't going to do
it -- each new open() creates a new struct file.  If you don't, vm_area
and struct file won't make much difference.
It's only when you consider multiple mappings made from the same file
descriptor (or passed through fork/exec) that there's a difference: then
struct file leads to sharing while vm_area does not.  There's also the
matter of files mapped and read with read() (e.g. ELF executables).
