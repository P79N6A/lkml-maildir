Subject: [RFC][PATCH] XFS: memory leak in xfs_inactive() - is xfs_trans_free() enough or do we need xfs_trans_cancel() ?

Hi,
The Coverity checker found a memory leak in xfs_inactive().
The offending code is this bit : 
1671 		tp = xfs_trans_alloc(mp, XFS_TRANS_INACTIVE);
At conditional (1): "truncate != 0" taking true path
1672 		if (truncate) {
1673 			/*
1674 			 * Do the xfs_itruncate_start() call before
1675 			 * reserving any log space because itruncate_start
1676 			 * will call into the buffer cache and we can't
1677 			 * do that within a transaction.
1678 			 */
1679 			xfs_ilock(ip, XFS_IOLOCK_EXCL);
1680 	
1681 			error = xfs_itruncate_start(ip, XFS_ITRUNC_DEFINITE, 0);
At conditional (2): "error != 0" taking true path
1682 			if (error) {
1683 				xfs_iunlock(ip, XFS_IOLOCK_EXCL);
Event leaked_storage: Returned without freeing storage "tp"
Also see events: [alloc_fn][var_assign]
1684 				return VN_INACTIVE_CACHE;
1685 			}
So, the code allocates a transaction, but in the case where 'truncate' is !=0 and xfs_itruncate_start(ip, XFS_ITRUNC_DEFINITE, 0); happens to return an error, we'll just return from the function without dealing with the memory allocated byxfs_trans_alloc() and assigned to 'tp', thus it'll be orphaned/leaked - not good.
What I'm wondering is this; is it enough, at this point, to call xfs_trans_free(tp); (it would seem to me that would be OK, but I'm not intimite with this code) or do we need a full xfs_trans_cancel(tp, 0);  ???
In case I'm right and xfs_trans_free(tp); is all we need, then please consider the patch below. Otherwise please NACK the patch and I'll cook up another one :-)
Fix memory leak on error in xfs_inactive().
