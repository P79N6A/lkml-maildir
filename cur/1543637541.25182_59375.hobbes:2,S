I'd say it should be maintained with the kernel.  The lib
building process would include specifying the ABI headers
which would be copied to /usr/include as part of the libc
install.  I'd rather keep this in the hands of the kernel
maintainers than have a new standards committee slowing
progress.
Building the kernel would reference the ABI headers in
/usr/include so the kernel built would match the libs.
Backward compatibility could be supported with by build-time
checks.  In essence this would make the kernel ABI against
which the libc was built act as a set of implied kernel
build options.  The kernel build process could eventually
detect incompatabilities for ABI changes via version
assertions.  (what do you think Kieth?)
A CML option CONFIG_ABI would default to /usr/include/...
to allow building kernels for other systems or in
anticipation of a libc rebuild. (a shot in the foot)
This way kernel builds could leave out deprecated
interfaces as soon as the local libc stopped relying on
them.
