Use the RPM - all of the instructions on what patches go in what order are
in the spec file. Or, you can simply copy the appropriate configuration file
from /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES to /usr/src/linux/.config, and do a "make
oldconfig; make dep; make clean; make install; make modules; make
modules_install". Voila, new kernel. Don't tell me this doesn't work because
I've done it myself.
