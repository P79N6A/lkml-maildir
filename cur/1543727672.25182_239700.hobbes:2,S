Subject: [PATCH] Restore PPP filtering
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Karsten Keil's patch entitled "[ISDN]: Fix kernel PPP/IPPP
active/passiv filter code" that went in back in April was an attempt
to solve a real problem - namely that the libpcap maintainers have
removed useful functionality that pppd was using - but his fix broke
existing pppd binaries and IMO didn't end up actually solving the
problem.
This patch reverts the change to ppp_generic.c so that existing pppd
binaries work again.  I am going to have to work out a proper fix,
which may involve further changes to ppp_generic.c, but I will make
sure existing pppd binaries still work.
Please apply.
