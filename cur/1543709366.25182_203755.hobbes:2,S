ok, you used PG_locked that already exists for another purpose so it was
not clear, another bitflag would be ok.
the main remaining issue to solve (and run at runtime) is the logic is
to keep this flag consistent with all vmas pointing to the page having
VM_LOCKED set. I'm not sure if it's worth it.
what we do in 2.4 and that works pretty well, that is simply to refile
pages into the active list if they're mlocked, so we don't waste too
much cpu on them since we don't analyze them too often. this should work
pretty well for everybody, or peraphs google may prefer to have a fully
consistent PG_mlocked.
