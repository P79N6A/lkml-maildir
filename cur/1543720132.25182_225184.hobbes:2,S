I'd vote to have the documented form that Andrew speaks of be arrays
of 32-bit words, which is what I understood Mikael was doing.  I agree
with Andrew's suggested to/from canonical functions.
I'd prefer not copying arrays of unsigned longs, due to the confusions
of coding to them across 32/64 bit and big/little endian architectures.
At times I have wished the kernel had chosen u32 arrays instead of
unsigned long arrays for bitmaps, for the same reason.  The cpumask
sprintf and parse format is intentionally 32-bit chunk friendly.
