Determining whether pre-conversion scsi was impacted in the same manner
would be part of that pinpointing process.
Deferring to softirq _has_ to add latency and any latency addition in
synchronous disk IO is very bad.  That being said, 150 usecs per request is
so bad that I'd be suspecting that it's not affecting most people, else
we'd have heard.

No, your point was that slotting this change into mainline without telling
anyone was OK because SCSI has been doing something similar.
