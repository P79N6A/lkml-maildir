Now that you mention it, the memory pages to hold the copied data is allocated 
at the time the snapshot device is activated, and uses 
alloc_page(GFP_KERNEL). Should we switch this to alloc_page(GFP_HIGHUSER)? I 
don't see many other places in the kernel tree that use this flag.
Of course, the number of these pages is currently a fixed limit per snapshot 
device (as I mentioned in an earlier reply), so it's kind of unlikely that 
these pages are a significant source of the memory usage that we're seeing in 
this test.
I'll see if I can start working on some improved congestion handling in DM. 
Hopefully that will make a noticeable difference.
Thanks for the help!
