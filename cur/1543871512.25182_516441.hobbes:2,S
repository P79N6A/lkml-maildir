Subject: [PATCH] minor updat to tlclk Kconfig entry
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/6/438

The tlclk driver is going on the MPCBL005 so I need to make the Kconfig
more more generic.  Just some text changes.
