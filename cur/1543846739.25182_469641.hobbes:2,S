Subject: Funky "Blue screen" issue while rebooting from X with 2.6.18-git21

I have a strange "problem" with 2.6.18-git21 that I've never had with
any previous kernel. If I open up an xterm in X, su to root and
'reboot' (or 'shutdown -r now') I instantly get a blue screen that
persists until the box actually reboots.
With previous kernels (all that I can remember, latest tested being
2.6.18-git15 (then I jumped from -git15 to -git21)) what happened was
that X would die and I would be returned to text mode so that I could
actually see all the shutdown messages from my init scripts (which is
very nice).
I don't really know what info would be relevant to provide regarding
this issue, so please ask for any info you need.
I can start testing kernels between 2.6.18-git15 and 2.6.18-git21
and/or  doing git bisects if anyone thinks it will be useful. If you
want that, please speak up, since I would rather not build and
test-boot a lot of kernels for no reason if nobody wants the info. But
if it will be useful I'll be happy to do it.
Anyway, there's a bug somewhere, let's squash it ;-)
