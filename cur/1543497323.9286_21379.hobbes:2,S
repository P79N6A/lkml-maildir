This is not a problem in page cache systems like Irix, Solaris or
SVR4 (UnixWare). File data is kept in the page cache, not in the
buffer cache, and the same page(s) are mapped or accessed by all 
the processes that access a file. If a process writes to a file
the new data becomes visible to all readers of the file as soon 
as the write system call has completed. Also note that certain
OS's do read/write serialization in the VFS layer anyway, quite
independently of what file systms do underneath (I believe SVR4
and Solaris behave this way).
