My own Inspiron 5000e is running a heavily patched-up (-jam with
grsecurity and a few other things merged in) 2.4.18-based kernel with no
problems.
I installed 2.4.18-ac2 on an Inspiron 7500 today, and rpm started
corrupting its database repeatedly (rpm --rebuilddb would only fix things
until I installed or freshened a few more packages, then the corruption
would come back). Upgrading rpm to the 4.0.3 release candidate from
Rawhide, then doing another rpm --rebuilddb to be safe, made this problem
completely disappear however, and the system is otherwise totally stable
so far.
