I did the same; same config, fresh tree, reboot between the test. 
The machine is a (single-processor) AMD K6-2/400 with 256 MB RAM.
Here are the results:
2.4.18-pre3	 	    real    7m55.243s
			    user    6m34.080s
			    sys     0m27.610s
2.4.18-pre+H7		    real    7m35.962s
			    user    6m34.270s
			    sys     0m27.700s
2.4.18-pre3-ac2		    real    7m39.203s
			    user    6m34.110s
			    sys     0m28.740s
Ingo's scheduler rocks, it runs like hell (and is absolutely stable here)  ;)
