In 2.6.12-rc4, I added acpi=off to the kernel command line and it 
panic-ed in acpi_get_firmware_table, called from the IPMI driver.
The attached patch fixes the problem, but it still spits out ugly 
"ACPI-0166: *** Error: Invalid address flags 8" errors.  So I doubt the 
patch is right, but maybe it points to something else.
Is it legal to call acpi_get_firmware_table if acpi is off?  If not, how 
can I tell that acpi is off?
