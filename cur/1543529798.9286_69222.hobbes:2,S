I tried doing something similar for fbcon, but could not. fbcon is by
far worst offender, and will happily block system for 500msec. if
(need_resched) schedule() does not work here. I tried adding
semaphores around fbcon entry points, but it does not seem to work.
(I replaced if (need_resched) schedule() with just schedule() -- I
hope that can not break anything...)
