Please check the definition of "cache coherence".
Summary: the CPU is indeed within its rights to execute loads and stores
to a single variable out of order, -but- only if it gets the same result
that it would have obtained by executing them in order.  Which means that
any reordering of accesses by a single CPU to a single variable will be
invisible to the software.

Can't help you there!  ;-)
