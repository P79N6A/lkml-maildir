Gidday,
Repeating some old news:
* man-pages now has a website:
      
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages
  The site includes HTML versions of the current set of man-pages.
* Since man-pages-2.69, each man page now includes a COLOPHON
  section at the end of the page which indicates the version of
  man-pages in which this page is released, and also contains a
  pointer to the man-pages web site.
* The list linux-man@vger.kernel.org has been created for
  the purpose of discussing Linux man page bugs, patches,
  and maintenance.  To subscribe, send a message to
  majordomo@vger.kernel.org, with the body:
        subscribe linux-man
Back to the news as usual...
I recently released man-pages-2.71 and man-pages-2.72.
These releases are now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    (Note the s/manpages/man-pages/ in these paths;
    a symlink with the old path will exist for
    a limited time.)
Changes in these releases can be seen at
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/changelog.html#release_2.71
and
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/changelog.html#release_2.72
Many of the changes in these releases consist of formatting and consistency
fixes.  A few of the changes that may be of interest to readers of this
list are summarized below.
Cheers,
Michael

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.71 ====================
Global changes
--------------
err.3
fts.3
getloadavg.3
queue.3
rcmd.3
rexec.3
stdin.3
elf.5
operator.7
    mtk
        Replaced the use of mdoc macros on these pages with man
        macros.  The only pages in man-pages that still use
        mdoc macros are mdoc.7 and mdoc.samples.7.
Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several places.
Changes to individual pages
---------------------------
fcntl.2
    mtk
        Document the F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC operation, which is
        new in kernel 2.6.24.
==================== Changes in man-pages-2.72 ====================
Global changes
--------------
abort.3
    mtk, after a note by Alex Tuninga
        A fairly significant rewrite to clarify operation of abort().
