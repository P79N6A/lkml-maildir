The problem is that the "bad" Sony devices return that they have 2 ports
available, however their endpoints do not reflect this.  So I check for
a read urb to test if this really is a valid port or not.
Hm, now that I can modify the number of ports on the fly, we should just
catch this in the initialization of the device which would solve this
problem the "right way".
