	You can allocate based on cpu_possible(cpu) (which is in the
next patch) if you like, but I think you're better off fixing the
existing NR_CPUS bloat as well, and keeping all the code simple.

	But there's an important difference between something which is
simple and unoptimized, and something which is unoptimizable.

But it also gave us crap like net/ipv4/route.c:ip_rt_acct_read() 8(
I know *you* benchmark and read the asm during optimization, but it's
quite clear that others are so scared of "bloat" criticism that they
optimize without measuring the straightforward case *first*.
Remember, to be cool:
	1) Use bitops and memory barriers not spinlocks,
	2) Use inlines everywhere,
	3) Use likely()/unlikely() on every branch
	4) Use prefetch() everywhere,
	5) Use gotos to minimize the path length
	6) __set_current_state() not set_current_state()
	7) Pass in current as a function param
