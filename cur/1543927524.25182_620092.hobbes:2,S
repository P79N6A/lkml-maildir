The compiler knows and emits assembly to compensate.

2MB * 16k = 32GB. Even with 4k cpus we will have 2M * 4k = 8GB both do
not fit in the 2GB area.
The offset relative to %gs cannot be used if you have a loop and are 
calculating the addresses for all instances. That is what we are talking 
about. The CPU_xxx operations that are using the %gs register are fine and 
are not affected by the changes we are discussing.

Real mapping? We have constant offsets after this patchset. I do not get 
what you are planning here.

Yes that is also how the current patchset works. I just do not understand 
what you want changed.
