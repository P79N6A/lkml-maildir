I will reply to that point later, I want to do some experiments with gcc 
first... I think it may work due to signextension but that implies the 
value must be signed which is of course implied by leaving out the "UL"... 
I will try it and report results...

Why should I need to bother with index/offset? It is much more natural to 
work with bytes. Also ntfs has to convert back and forth to bytes (internal 
NTFS storage for sizes is s64 in units of bytes in many places), ntfs 
clusters, pages, and buffer heads which are all different sizes so your 
approach would be a complete code mess.
Also the page cache limit of 32-bit index is IMO not good and needs to be 
removed. The code needs to be able to cope with true 64-bits. We already 
have sector_t that can be defined to 64-bit. Once it is used everywhere it 
will be relatively easy to do something simillar for struct page. Of course 
people are going to scream so it will just be a compile time option. Or 
even just an out of tree patch but still I consider 64-bit support on 
32-bit architectures very important in the future and I belive I am not 
alone seeing Matt Domsch (sp?)'s comments for example... I guess it boils 
down to how quickly the 64-bit cpus will become standard comodity hardware 
vs how quick available storage will blow the 32-bit page cache limit...
Best regards,
