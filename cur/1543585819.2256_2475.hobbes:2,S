fork() is allowed to return a failure value, and it already does so if
there isn't enough memory (at least with the limited tests I've come up
with).  Guess again.
I have, however, found a bug in the non-overcommit patch - it seems to be
capable of double-freeing (and then some) - starting 4 Java VMs and then
closing them causes VMReserved to go negative on my system.
