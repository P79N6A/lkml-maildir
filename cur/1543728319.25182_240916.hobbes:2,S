It might be a symlink on your machine, but that doesn't mean it's the
right way. For almost 7 years, /dev/console is a separate device, not a
symlink. Here's the relevant section from Documentation/devices.txt:
  The console device, /dev/console, is the device to which system
  messages should be sent, and on which logins should be permitted in
  single-user mode.  Starting with Linux 2.1.71, /dev/console is managed
  by the kernel; for previous versions it should be a symbolic link to
  either /dev/tty0, a specific virtual console such as /dev/tty1, or to
  a serial port primary (tty*, not cu*) device, depending on the
  configuration of the system.
Linux-2.1.71 was released on December 4, 1997. In your signature you
claim to run linux-2.4.26. Please update your system.
