I can successfully boot my M400 under 2.6.18-rc5.  Even better, I can
now enable hotpluggable CPUs and successfully suspend and resume.  I
needed the SATA patch (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/20/56
), referenced in
the "T60 not coming out of suspend to RAM" thread as well, so I would
like to second Michael Tsirkin's request that this be merged in.
