You can't hardlink a directory.
I'll tell another way that will let you understand correctly for sure.
I want that the i_link of an inode can be changed only by an user that has
write permissions on the inode. I don't care if the permissions cames from
the uid/gid/other settings in the inode.
I don't want an luser to increase the i_link of my inodes that he doesn't
have permission to change, to read to execute and to write.

Doing the additional permission check in the VFS won't make things
simpler.
