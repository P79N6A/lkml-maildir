Con,
I have not tested the latest patch from you, but I'm actually running with the one you made public yesterday and it behaves VERY strangely. Sometime, with only XMMS and aMSN (an Instant Messaging app), if I pick an xterm and move it around the screen very fast, xmms stops clearly until I stop doing bad things with the window.
Other times, even when I'm compiling something, I can do that with the windows and XMMS doesn't stop at all.
Very strange, not to?
When I have time, I'll test you patch from today.
Thanks,
