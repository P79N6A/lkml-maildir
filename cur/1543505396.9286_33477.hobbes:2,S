Hi all. I really hope I don't act stupid by seeking
help here since I am at end's witts. By using the
stock kernel in RH 6.0 (2.2.5-15 later upgraded to
2.2.5-22) my sound card was detected at ESS1688 which
was fine for me even though I had an ESS1788.
Unfortunately when I upgraded to 2.2.10-4 (RPM kernel
from the RPM repository <UK-based>), my sound card was
detected as an ESS1868. The bad point is my wav files
and mp3 files get frighteningly slow making my P133
like a 286. Midis were okay. I didn't have time to
test mod files as mikmod was giving me the error"
cannot initialise sound device" like errors. Is there
any way to make the kernel correctly identify my sound
card and correct these errors ? I tried recompiling
the kernel using the rpm source and at one time,
download the bzip2 version of it and recompile it but
to no avail. I do hope I don't get flame for this
small problem but I do appreciate critical feedback
from you good guys :-).
Nickelby
