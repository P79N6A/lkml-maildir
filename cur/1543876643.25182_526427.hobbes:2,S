This is true, of course.  However, there are going to be a set of 
virtual devices which don't necessarily have to have super-high 
performance.  In the case of a hwrng device, even doing DMA is probably 
overkill.

If we can get a set of device drivers that if not all then at least a 
number of hypervisors and/or emulators can agree upon, I think that's 
much won.
