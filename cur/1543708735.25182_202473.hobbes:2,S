Yes, I know.
Unfortunately we want the trans2 version when reading directories, the
core version does not understand "long" filenames. The previous 2.4 code
does that, but uses the "core" version for getting file attributes.
The problem with using two different requests is that they have different
resolutions on file modification times. The core can only return odd- or
even-numbered seconds (I forget which). This makes programs like 'tar'
complain if the date they read from the dir does not always match the date
they read from getattr.
Now, when looking at the output of ethereal it re-reads attributes for the
/ inode a lot. It's not supposed to do a refresh if it thinks it has a
fairly recent copy, see smb_revalidate_inode and SMB_MAX_AGE. That could 
be making this problem worse.

No, but you didn't know the background.
Btw, if you mount using the "oldattr" mount option you should get the
"core" behaviour back.
