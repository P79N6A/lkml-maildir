Subject: Git help for kernel archeology, suppress diffs caused by CVS keyword expansion

It would really be useful if git diff had an option for suppressing
diffs caused by CVS keyword expansion. I run into this problem over
and over when trying to recover stuff out of old kernel sources that
people checked into CVS and then posted CVS diffs to fulfill their GPL
obligations. I sometimes wonder if vendors are doing this on purpose
to make it more difficult to recover the changes they made to the
code.
To prevent this in the future, I'd love to see a patch removing all
CVS keywords from the kernel sources. Quick grep of kernel shows 1,535
$Id, 197 $Log, 441 $Revision, 144 $Date. I guestimate that this would
remove about 5,000 lines form the kernel source and touch 1,700 files.
Would this be accept or do those expansions contain useful info?
Example diff caused by $Log expansion:
diff --git a/arch/cris/kernel/ptrace.c b/arch/cris/kernel/ptrace.c
index b3d10fb..32e47ca 100644
--- a/arch/cris/kernel/ptrace.c

There are a more CVS keywords that can cause expansion, probably around twenty.
When removing these with a simple grep it can get fooled and mess up.
CVS keyword expansion adds about 60,000 lines of noise to a typical
diff.
