If the linux developers DONT take up the gaunlet thrown here, we (as a
community and as a product) will never live it down.
It would be MUCH better to participate and lose then to ignore it entirely.
And yes, I'm sure MS will be doing internal tweaking to NT for performance
sake. And we should do the same.
I remember YEARS ago (like 2) there was a patch to Apache (maybe it was
NCSA) that actually put it into the kernel (I assume for performance sake).
Maybe we should do something like that? :)
Peace!
