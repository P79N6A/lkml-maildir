Subject: sound drop outs with 2.6.1 and via82xx

Hello,
I have installed the 2.6.1 kernel on an AMD 64 (x86_64) and have an 
integrated onboard sound chip VIA VT8237.
The problem is, that the sound sometimes drops out or is distorted.
Drop outs appear reproducible when I minimize and maximize a Window in 
KDE on X11. (I've tried both the nvidia module and the X11 nv driver).
Additionally I get the message "linux kernel: ALSA via82xx.c:704: 
invalid via82xx_cur_ptr, using last valid pointer". But I'm not sure if 
this is connected with my problem, because when I boot the 2.4.21 kernel 
on the same machine I get the same error message in line 696, but I 
don't experience drop outs of the sound.
I use the default configuration of the via82xx module in both cases, 
that is no options in modprobe.conf or modules.conf.
Besides the lost pointer, does the problem come from the via82xx module 
at all?
Can someone help me in this matter?
Detlef
