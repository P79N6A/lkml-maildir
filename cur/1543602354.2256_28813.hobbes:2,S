OK, so the above is nonsense.  I reverted through each of the kernels
I have built of late--and kapm.idled is what is taking up all the
time.  Which I guess is the right thing to do, I had heard about this
once, but then I got confused by it when I suddenly started paying
lots of attention.  It is unfortunate that an idle daemon doesn't get
counted as free, but I think I understand why.  Sorry for the
confusion.
Still, I am convinced the constant report of zero swap usage is wrong
in 2.4.9-ac15.
