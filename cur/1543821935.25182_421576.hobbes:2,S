Steve Pass wrote an mptable program for FreeBSD back in the day.  I
patched it up to compile on 64 bit linux systems.
It's on:
http://smatch.sourceforge.net/upload/mptable.c
Steve has some sample output uploaded here.

These days most things use ACPI, but it's still pretty useful if you
have to support older software.
