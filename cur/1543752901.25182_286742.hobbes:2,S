It's one of the standard anti-fragmentation tactics. The large free
areas come from the middle, address ordering disposes of holes in the
used areas, and the areas at opposite ends reflect expected lifetimes.
It's more useful for cases where there is not an upper bound on the
size of an allocation (or power-of-two blocksizes). On second thought,
Mel's approach exploits both the bound and the power-of-two restriction
advantageously.
