One concern I had regarding relayfs, which was raised previously, was 
regarding its use of vmap, 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110755199913216&w=2 On x86, 
the vmap space is at a premium, and this space is reserved over the entire 
lifetime of a 'channel'. Is the use of vmap really critical for 
performance?
thanks,
