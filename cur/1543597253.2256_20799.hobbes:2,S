Cisco's Linux iSCSI driver is now available under the General Public
License. The iSCSI protocol is an emerging standard for connecting
SCSI storage over existing IP networks.
Currently two versions are available. One implements iSCSI
version 0 (July 2000) and interoperates with existing iSCSI devices.
The second, in active development, implements draft-06+. Both drivers
should work with current 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels.
A description of the driver is available on the project home
page at:
   
http://linux-iscsi.sourceforge.net/
The project itself is managed on SourceForge at:
