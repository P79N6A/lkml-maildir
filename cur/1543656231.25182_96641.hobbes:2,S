Hi all,
does anyone know where this is printed out in kernel source?
Linux version 2.4.20 (root@codeman) (gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian 
prerelease)) #1 Mon Dec 16 16:54:44 CET 2002
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
...
I only want to know where the first line is printed out (that is a dmesg 
output). I want to put in a printk just before the first line.
I thought somewhere in arch/$arch/kernel/setup.c but I cannot figure out 
where.
ciao, Marc
