If you really want a filesystem that supports efficient copying you
probably want it to have the equivalent of COW blocks, so that a copy
just sets up a few pointers, and the copy only happens when the original
or copied files are changed.
But basically you wont get a syscall until you have a filesystem with
semantics that only maps onto this sort of operation.
