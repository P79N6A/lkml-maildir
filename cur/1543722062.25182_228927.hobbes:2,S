Actually I think the point I'm trying to make can't be fairly conveyed
without providing a lot of background of what can be done with Adeos. I
would suggest that those interested do some digging. Among other things,
you may want to read about RTAI/fusion:

Here's a quote from Philippe on how this compares to HRT:

Unfortunately, there's no sustained vendor push behind this kind of stuff
as their is for HRT, but my experience has been that this is for lack of
understanding of what Linux can/should be able to provide as a GPOS then
anything else (i.e. a lot of "embedded"/"carrier-grade" vendors seem to
somehow believe that eventually plain vanilla Linux could become hard-rt
simply by virtue of adding more and more features on top of it ...
preemption, HRT, interrupt threading, etc.etc.etc. While the fact of the
matter is that Linux is a GPOS and that it really should catter for the
average case and leave the hard-rt part to something built with that in
mind.) For having been involved with the use of Linux in real-time systems
for over 5 years now, I firmly believe any potential solution to determinism
in Linux goes through something like Adeos. The example of RTAI/fusion is
just one out of many of what can be achieved with such an approach while
making it simple for application developers to create applications built
on "standard" APIs.
