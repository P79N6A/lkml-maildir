Why?

You forget that SCSI is not head-active, so there can indeed be merges
against a request that was re-added to the queue list.

Yes it can happen.

Right, that looks like a bug. I would prefer SCSI using
end_that_request_first here actually.

There can be front merges too. If a head is active, then no merging can
occcur. But for SCSI, the front request must always be in a sane state.
Or bad things can happen, like you describe.

Right

How about just adding 
	if (req->cmd != next->cmd
	    || req->rq_dev != next->rq_dev
	    || req->nr_sectors + next->nr_sectors > q->max_sectors
	    || next->sem || req->special)
                return;
ie check for special too, that would make sense to me. Either way would
work, but I'd rather make this explicit in the block layer that 'not
normal' requests are left alone. That includes stuff with the sem set,
or special.
