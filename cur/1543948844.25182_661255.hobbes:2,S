That looks nice.

That doesn't.  It sounds like cpusets legacy has mucked us up here?
Could we do something like auto-prefixing user-created directories with a
fixed string so that there is no way in which the user can cause a
collision with kernel-created files?
I suppose that would break cpusets back-compatibility as well?  If so, we
could do the prefixing only for non-cpusets directories, but that's getting
a bit weird.

hm.  I guess that all the kernel-generated file names are known up-front
and that they are instantiated early, so if a user tried to create a cgroup
called "tasks", than that would just fail.
But, as you say, later addition of new kernel-created files might collide
with prior userspace installations.
So yet another option would be to promise to prefix all _future_
kernel-generated files with "kern_", and to change the implementation now
to reject any user-created files which start with "kern_".  hm.
