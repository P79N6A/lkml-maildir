Andries, no offense, but IMO it just replaces a kludge with more elaborate
one. Sorry. Yes, 31 bits will probably be sufficient forever (shut up, Albert)
but rules like that _really_ look ugly. Yes, it will work. But try to
describe the rules in a manpage and see if you will be able to look at it
without a feeling that it's an overcomplicated kludge. Yes, mount(2) is a
rarely used interface, but IMO it still should make sense. And yes, IMO
a new syscall would be better than that - in that case we are getting simple
rules in a new version + old version with all its warts for those who want
to use it.
