it isnt. it is from AVM.
ftp://ftp.avm.de/cardware/fritzcrd.dsl_usb/linux/suse.93/
(despite its name, it is usable for other distributions, too)
if its a very bad idea to ask for help for modules, that are not part of 
the kernel source, please tell me at least, what kind of error that is 
(if someone can...)
is it the modules fault? is it acpi related? ....
greets,
	manuel.
