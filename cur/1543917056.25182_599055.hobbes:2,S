I don't know that the so-called requirements are, but if you
have a distribution tree mounted on /mnt and you perform the
following operations:
cd /mnt
chroot . bin/bash
That shell, will not leave the new root until it exits or
executes `chroot`. I've tried the "tricks" about mounting
/proc and changing to 'cwd' of init, etc. However, your
new root needs to NOT have the chroot utility available
and/or the system call needs to be removed or trapped
in the runtime library of the new root, because, quite
obviously, a root process can do anything it wants.
That's how Unix was designed. So, if you don't want
somebody to get out of your 'jail' don't provide
the keys. It's clearly not a kernel issue.
Cheers,
