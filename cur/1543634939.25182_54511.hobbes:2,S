We really don't want to do this, please.  Changing things so
that we can only run bh2jh() and, particularly, journal_add_journal_head()
on a locked buffer would involve fairly unpleasant surgery against
parts of ext3 which are already prone to exploding.  Like
do_get_write_access().
If it was needed for 2.5 then hmm, maybe.  But as this is only a
2.4 problem then I really don't think we should risk breaking
or slowing down the filesystem for this.
Look, it's easy: delete buffer_head.b_inode (which is only used as 
a boolean), move its function to a b_state bit.  Add a new
buffer_head.ext3_hack and we can use that for pointing at the journal_head.
