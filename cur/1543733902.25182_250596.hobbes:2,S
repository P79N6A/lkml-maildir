Calling ldisc.receive_buf directly() should be OK as long as you're
not in an interrupt handler.  (For example the comtrol driver polls in
a timer bottom-half, so it's OK to call ldisc.receive_buf).
Unfortunately, some drivers don't quite follow the rules.

The hangup handling needs to be completely redone, so that we don't
force serial drivers to do a completely shutdown of the port in an
interrupt context.  If the drivers are careful, it can be safe, but
it's too hard to handle hangup correctly.  
If you have time to work on the tty layer (sucker!!!), please go ahead
and start work by all means.  I was hoping to have time to clean up
some of the more egregious problems sometime next year (after I escape
back into development), but getting this fixed sooner rather the later
would be a definitely Good Thing.
