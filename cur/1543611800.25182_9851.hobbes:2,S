Donald, I'm not even thinking about planning a 128 CPU scalability for
Linux.
The whole point of this discussion ( if any ) is that we've to design on
what we've or on what we expect to have in a very near future.
We cannot play with technology on long term plans because, no matter how
good we plan, it'll screw us up.
