The reasons are as follows: I chose subl because it sets the condition
codes in such a way as to determine which of 3 states the lock was in
(unlocked, locked for reading but uncontended for writing and contended
for writing), which is used to decide which action to take for rwsems. In
addition, subl is faster than cmpxchgl for the typically uncontended case.
