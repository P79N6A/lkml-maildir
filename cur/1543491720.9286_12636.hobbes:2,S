There are currently many bugs in the VFAT code which can lead to data
corruption and subsequent random bad behavior.  Alexander Viro is
currently testing some patches (you can get them at ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/) 
to fix these bugs (still early alpha).
In the meantime please consider VFAT and MSDOS as broken.  They WILL fail
under load in a messy way.
