Intel's Open Source Technology Center is pleased to announce the
LessWatts.org project, an open source project for saving power on Linux.
http://www.lesswatts.org
What is LessWatts.org about?
----------------------------
LessWatts.org is a place to bring users, developers and distribution 
makers together around power reduction for linux machines, from mobile 
to desktop to server to datacenter. LessWatts.org is about a 
system-level approach to power savings, from the lowest level device 
drivers in the kernel to the most advanced desktop applications. 
LessWatts.org is about things you can do to reduce power usage. 
LessWatts.org is about longer battery life, a lower airconditioning 
bill, about reducing the impact of computers on the environment.
LessWatts.org brings together a set of tips & tricks, tools, 
technology development projects as well as documentation around power 
saving.
Projects
--------
At this time of launching the LessWatts.org project, the technology 
development projects are those that Intel has started, is involved in 
or has just started working on, such as PowerTOP, Tickless Idle, 
Graphics and various link power management techniques. We'd like to 
invite all developers and projects that focus on power saving to join 
the LessWatts.org effort and community.
