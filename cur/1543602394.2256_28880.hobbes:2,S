When files on a ReiserFS mount have data from other files, does that mean
that it has recovered wrong meta-data, or is it because the meta-data was
committed before the data?
So, if I write a file, does ReiserFS write the structures first, and if the
data isn't written, whatever else was deleted from the block before will now
be in the file?
If that's so, then one way to keep old deleted data from getting into
partially written files after a crash would be to zero out the blocks on
unlink.  I can imagine that this would prevent undelete, and slow down
deleting considerably.
Another way, may be to keep a journal of which blocks have actually been
committed.  Maybe a bitmap in the journal, or some other structure...
If you have data journaling, does that mean there is a possability of
recovering a complete file -before- it was written?  i.e:
echo a > test;
sync;
cat picture.tif > test
(writing in progress, only partially in journal)
power off
Will "a" be in test upon recovery?
