Hmmm I just discovered that my filesystem got fairly corrupted with
2.4.0-test7 proper. It has been up for 5 days nonstop and there was 
no problems. I have decided to shut it down only to discover that 
contest of /sbin directory is pretty much a soup.
went back to 2.4.0-test7-pre2 and it seems be fine so far.
I'm not sure what exactly caused it it might have something to do w/ 
me using vfat shortly before attemtping to shut it down.
I believe I also got some warnings in dmesg like 
	init_special_inode: bogus inode
but not sure if they were related to the corruption itself.
