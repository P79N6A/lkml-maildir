Patrick Mansfield mentioned that the following will fix limitiation #2
mentioned above:
echo 512 > /sys/module/scsi_mod/parameters/max_luns
This applies to other vendor's kernels as well, so I will go ahead and
made sure that this is set correctly when /etc/init.d/initiator is
started.  I will put a new .deb up shortly, as well as include this into
the next release of core-iscsi-tools.
Thanks again Patrick!
