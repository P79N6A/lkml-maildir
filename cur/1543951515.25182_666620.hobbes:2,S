The best solution in this case is a hardware watchdog. Hardware
watchdogs are present on some server motherboards, most embedded x86
CPU boards and also in PowerPC CPU's. The Linux kernel supports some
hardware watchdogs, see also Device Drivers/Watchdog Timer Support in
the Linux kernel config.
The nmi_watchdog=<timeout> parameter might be interesting too. See
also Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt.
