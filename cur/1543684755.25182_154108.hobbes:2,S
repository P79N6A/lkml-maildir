why not bring the other parts in as options as well?
I can understand not bringing in all the external security modules that
want to regulate access to everything else (full capabilities, etc) but
locking down the kernel itself to prevent it from being modified seems
like something that would have a place on most servers, possibly also on
desktops that aren't dynamicly adding hardware (probably not that useful
for many laptop users for this reason)
we already have the option to not support modules (as Alan Cox points out
every time that subject comes up it can be bypassed by people who have
access to /dev/*mem) so it would seem that adding the option to bar access
to /dev/*mem as well would make exisitng config options mean what they
appear to mean.
