But the only *new* cases of taking the mmap_sem that this would
introduce would be:
- on a failed vm limit charge
- when a task exit/exec causes an mm ownership change
- when a task moves between two cgroups in the memrlimit hierarchy.
All of these should be rare events, so I don't think the additional
contention is a worry.

Yes, potentially. But if the upside of that is that we eliminate a
lock/unlock on a shared lock on every mmap/munmap call, it might well
be worth it.

For getting the first cut of the memrlimit controller working this may
well make sense. But it would be nice to avoid it longer-term.
