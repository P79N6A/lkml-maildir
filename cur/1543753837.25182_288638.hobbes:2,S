Hi,
my AT keyboard is dead on 2.6 series. Tests on other machines proves 
that this is my-hardware-specyfic problem (exacly the same binnary works 
on different mainboards with PS/2 keyboard and another AT keyboard). 2.4 
series works correctly. On 2.6 kernel seems to not hear what keyboard 
wants to tell him (eg. atkbd.reset preforms keyboard reset but reports 
error). Were any hadrware-handling changes made since 2.4? If so, how to 
undo them and make keyboard alive? I'm grateful for any help.
