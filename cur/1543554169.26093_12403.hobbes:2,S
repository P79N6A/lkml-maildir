I don't think I mentioned complexity - in what was do you mean adding
complexity? If you mean addition funciton then yes. If you mean kernel
source modificaiton then no. If you mean the mechanism then it's nothing
special - just what a loader does when it fixes up an external reference.

Quite agree, there are no standard hooks, no hooks at all in fact. I'm
neither seeking to get this accepted or not accepted into the kernel. What
it does do is give me an easier time both as a developer and an installer
when I want to include some rarefied code additions. GKHI was developed
primarily for DProbes.

Great!
