It would be even nicer if support for per-user/group ulimits were in 2.4,
as currently only per-process limits are supported by bash/PAM. This would
solve the "X-gets-killed" problem, as long as you're not logged in as
root.
Of course, this wouldn't change the fact that most distros don't even
bother setting ulimits out of the box.
