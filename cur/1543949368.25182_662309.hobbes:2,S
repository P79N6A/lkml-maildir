Subject: [PATCH 008 of 9] md: Fix possible raid1/raid10 deadlock on read error during resync.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Thanks to K.Tanaka and the scsi fault injection framework, here is
a fix for another possible deadlock in raid1/raid10 error handing.
If a read request returns an error while a resync is happening and
a resync request is pending, the attempt to fix the error will block
until the resync progresses, and the resync will block until the
read request completes.  Thus a deadlock.
This patch fixes the problem.
