Subject: PS/2 Mouse does no longer work with kernel 2.6 on a laptop

Hello everybody!
I'm trying to switch my laptop from kernel 2.4 to kernel 2.6.2. Everything 
seems to work correctly, only my PS/2 mouse doesn't.
My laptop has a touchpad and a PS/2 port. On the PS/2 port I usually attach a 
Logitech trackball. With kernel 2.4 I was able to use touchpad and trackball 
at the same time. With kernel 2.6 the trackball on the PS/2 port seems to be 
recognized, but it doesn`t work :( Neither in X11 nor with gpm on the console 
I get an input from the trackball, i.e. I can`t move the pointer nor click.
The kernel gives me the following information about the found input devices:
i8042.c: Detected active multiplexing controller, rev 1.1.
serio: i8042 AUX0 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 AUX1 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
input: PS2++ Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio2
serio: i8042 AUX2 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 AUX3 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
input: PS/2 Generic Mouse on isa0060/serio4
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
Also in /dev/input exists these devices:
crw-r--r--    1 root     root      13,  63 1970-01-01 00:00 mice
crw-r--r--    1 root     root      13,  32 1970-01-01 00:00 mouse0
crw-r--r--    1 root     root      13,  33 1970-01-01 00:00 mouse1
Other non-PS/2 devices work, e.g. when I attach an USB mouse, that mouse 
works. 
What could be wrong with my configuration?
