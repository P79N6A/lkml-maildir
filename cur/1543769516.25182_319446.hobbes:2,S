It's also hard to see what is happening in 'C'. When I execute
this:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int cnt, char *argv[], char *env[], char *aux[])
{
     printf("Aux 0 = %s\n", aux[0]);
//    printf("Aux 1 = %s\n", aux[1]);
}
I get:
Aux 0 = GLIBC_2.0
The next pointer is a NULL pointer, so 'C' has dorked something.
When I play in assembler, (crt.o startup) I get a pointer that
points to:
 	bffffb6c	- pointer of the stack
 	00000020	- dereferenced
This shows that ld-linux.so, that got called first, didn't
preserve the vector.
Cheers,
