Plain 2.6.0-test5 is affected. (so don't blame me)
The /proc filesystem gets really messed up when you
create more threads than you have PID values. Yes,
you can do this. I created 40000 threads on a system
with pid_max of 32768 and a threads-max of 98304.
This should not be allowed, for obvious reasons, and
because it breaks the /proc filesystem. Doing a
simple "/bin/ls /proc" would return 0, 1, or 2 of
every file. Stuff like /proc/cpuinfo was affected,
not just the process directories.
