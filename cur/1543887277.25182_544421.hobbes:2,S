smp_call_function_single() is a mess.
- it's unclear to me why smp_call_function_single(cpu, ...) doesn't just
  call the darn function if cpu==smp_processor_id().
- it's unclear to me why smp_call_function_single(cpu, ...) doesn't just
  call the darn function if CONFIG_SMP=n.
- it's unclear to me why smp_call_function_single(cpu, ...) isn't called
  smp_call_function_on(cpu, ...)
- the x86_64 version doesn't return -EBUSY: it returns zero.  Despite its
  claim "Retrurns 0 on success, else a negative status code.".
- i386 _does_ return -EBUSY.

These are all excellent questions.  And important ones.   I would suggest:
- May be called with preemption enabled.  The implementation must take
  care of that.
- May not be called under local_irq_disable() for the usual reasons.
- Will run the callback function under local_irq_disable() (this is
  unimportant at present, but if we decide to later change it to run the
  callback even on !SMP builds, we'll need to take care of that like we did
  in on_each_cpu())

Your patch seems appropriate given the present and proposed peculiar
semantics, but I think we need more work in there.  x86_64 needs its return
value fixing asap, surely.
