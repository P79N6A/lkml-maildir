Well, I have tried your suggestion, and it works beautifully...  The
only change I made was to the cpu type (to 686), and everything *just*
works now...  Thanks, all!!!

From the look of things, you're being bitten by the VIA southbridge
problem.  As I've gathered, its some sort of interaction with that chip
and the 3DNow! fast copy routines the kernel uses.
If you compile the kernel for a 686, does the problem go away?  What
about 586 or lower?  If so, I believe there are some people working on
finding common aspects of the hardware that experience this problem,
though I don't remember who.  You should get in contact with them, or
they might get into contact with you.
Good luck on working this out.
