Hi Greg, 
It appears while debugging camserv to add some features, if I kill camserv 
prematurely, and try to unload the pwc driver I am unable to. 
I get the following:
PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
1068 root      20  -5     0    0    0 R 95.8  0.0   3:26.84 khubd
The kernel USB hub daemon goes nuts. 
If I disconnect the cam from the USB

What information do you need? Yes I know it's bad to yank out USB devices that 
aren't properly shut down.
Thanks, 
Shawn.
