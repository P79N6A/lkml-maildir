Chuck Ebbert at redhat.com asked:

bisects go bad.
As requested I started to redo the test but now without git
using kernel.org tars. The results now are, still using the same .config:
linux-2.6.20.tar.gz  : bad
linux-2.6.20.1.tar.gz: bad (boot log equal)
linux-2.6.20.2.tar.gz: good
linux-2.6.20.3.tar.gz: good
(triple checked)
Chuck is right, the bisect gone bad.
I asked Nilshar to try these kernels too with:
COMPAT_VDSO=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
He did and says 2.6.20.3 works fine. So only 2.6.20 and 2.6.20.1 had
this 'hang' at boot behavior on my Supermicro 7044 while Nilshar's
machine started working with 2.6.20.3
Reverting avoided imo. I hope more people cheer up who reported bug #8040
and confirm it's fine with the latest stable.
