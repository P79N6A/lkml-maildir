Thanks for merging video.c
When I did my builds, andrew had not yet scribbled on video.c.
I usually do a "last minute" pull to make sure you are not faced
with any merges, but this time when I did I got some version of your
tree that wouldn't build so I figured it was still moving and didn't
bother merging with it.
Anyway, I looked over this file and the things I looked for seemed okay,
but to be sure I'll repeat your merge tomorrow and see if I come
up with the same thing.

You picked the right one.
Indeed, it looks like the other files touched in Julia's earlier
patch (9030062f3d61f87c1e787b3aa134fa3a8e4b2d25)
don't handle the failure case quite right --
Rui and I will follow-up.
