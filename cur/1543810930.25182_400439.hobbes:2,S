Does 16MB still work? Gets the kernel out of the old ZONE_DMA. I suppose 
not many people are really using that anyway anymore these days, but if 
no downsides maybe?
Also, did the kernel still boot on a 4M machine, and would it still do 
so with the change to 4M as posted? 2.4 used to boot fine with 4M. Not 
certain anymore if I ever tested that with 2.6 (and can't right now).
Rene.
