The point is that we _trust_ intel when they says "this will work".
Therefore, we can use the optimizations. It was never about
legal matters. If we didn't trust intel, then we couldn't
use their processors at all.
We couldn't take the chance before. It was not documented
to work, verification by testing would not be trivial at all for
this case.
Linux is about "stability first, then performance".
Now we _know_ that we can have this optimization without
compromising stability. Nobody knew before!
