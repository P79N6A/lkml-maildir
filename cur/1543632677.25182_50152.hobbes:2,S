Just for reference: my machine at home has a SiS645DX (ATA/133) plus a
Promise PDC20268 (ATA/100). The latest SUSE distribution (2.4.18 based)
falls flat on its face, the IDE drivers fail to handle both IDE
controllers.
Andre's patches supposedly fix the Promise issue, but the SiS problem
is still unresolved in Linux.
