Hmmm.  The hard part isn't making printk(0,blah) mean the same as not having a 
log level message now, because the current logic already handles it.  The 
problem is that filtering continuations of previous messages involves knowing 
what log level the previous message was so you know whether or not to filter 
it.
Yeah, that would take some doing to untangle.  An incremental switchever (easy 
printks first, I.E. the ones that currently specify a loglevel) seems more 
strongly indicated...
That said, I started this by noting I haven't personally had time to bang on 
this since I thought of it.  You did ask for ideas. :)
