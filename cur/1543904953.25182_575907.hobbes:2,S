Greg/Peter/Al,
I've been using the edgeport 4 port USB to Serial Converter 
to monitor APC Smart UPS's via apcupsd for quite awhile on 
various Linux boxes.
I just upgraded to Kernel Version 2.6.22.1 from 2.6.20.6 on a 
couple of systems and both the edgeports stopped communicating.
I tried applying various patches, "PATCH 026/149" and "PATCH 082/149" 
and one by Alan Cox..  but they didn't fix the problem.
I copied the 2.6.20.6 edgeport module sources to the new 
2.6.22.1 tree and everything works again.
          linux/drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.c
          linux/drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.h
          linux/drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.mod.c
          linux/drivers/usb/serial/io_tables.h
I thought you guys ought to be aware of this....
                  Nick Pasich
