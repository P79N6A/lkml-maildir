The advice given by the NSA during our B1
evaluation was that is was that in the case
above was that the MAC check should be done
first (because it's more important) and
because you want the audit record to report
the MAC failure whenever possible. The
team advised us that if we didn't do the MAC
check first we would have a tough row to hoe
explaining the design decision and an even
tougher time explaining that the audit of
MAC criteria had been met.
