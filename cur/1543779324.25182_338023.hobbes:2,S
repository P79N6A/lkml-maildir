As this isn't the only chip of this sort (i.e. a
multi-function chip not on the CPU bus) maybe we
should store the bus driver in a common place. If
needed we could have a very simple bus driver
subsystem (this might already be in the kernel, I
haven't looked at the bus stuff) in which you register
a bus driver and client drivers register with the bus
driver. Just an idea :-).
