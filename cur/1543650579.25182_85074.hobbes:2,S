The feeling I got on this was the ability to let users define their own
groups.  Perhaps I'm not following it closely enough but that was the
impression I got in terms of "what this does for us"; I'm probably
missing other things.  Just that ability would be nice in my view
though.  Isn't it something that's been in AFS for a long time too?
I've got a few friends who've played with AFS before (at CMU and the
like) and really enjoyed the ACLs there.
	Just my thoughts,
