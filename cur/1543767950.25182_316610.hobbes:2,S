This is a chicken-and-egg problem. Unless we have kexec/kdump
in mainline with a lot of users, we may not find out all the 
corner cases.

FWIW, based on prior experience in other OS, I believe that kexec
based approach is the most flexible and safest for supporting such
a diverse set of platforms that linux supports. The issues however
are -
1. I don't think we can achieve kdump with very high reliability within
   the few months it has had so far. Again, if prior experience
   with similar mechanism is worth anything, it will take a long
   time to achieve very high reliability on dozens of chipsets, several
   cpus, dozens of different platforms and various combinations
   thereof not to mention many different situations when kdump
   is used.
2. The way I see it, beyond a certain amount reliability (common
   x86, x86_64, ppc64 platforms, normal kernel developer use), we
   will need exposure to a much larger user base (large customer
   deployments will be the most useful) to find and sort out the remaining
   corner cases.
I hope we have it available for a large user base in mainline
as soon as it is reliable enough for common platforms and
kernel developer use.
Thanks
