I don't know, and to be perfectly honest, I don't care.
I live in the Free World where software patents are explicitly illegal.
I am not interested in keeping up with which countries allow such insanity, 
or wherever some tinpot dictatorship declares certain usage of wellknown 
algorithms to be illegal.
Sorry, but this kind of insanity depresses me. It's GPL'd code. If you live 
in a sane country you're permitted to do what you like with it. If you 
live in the USA you're permitted to copy, modify and distribute it but you 
may not be permitted to use it - but that's fine because the GPL doesn't 
say you have to be allowed to use it.
I'm sure there are countries where you're not allowed to copy it because 
it's a fairly safe bet that I stuck an obscenity into a comment somewhere - 
does that mean we shouldn't allow it to be GPL'd at all?
