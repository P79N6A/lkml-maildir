The kernel side isnt, the signal handling isnt always "normal". Its the
extreme case of the problem not the general one. Fixing the vfork/clone
crash is doable, and one approach would be to solve the problem by
saying "if you claim to be a thread group with the new style flags you
get to be killed as a group and dumped as a group", with old stuff
behaving like it always did before.
