Andrew, much thanks for fixing that. That error triggered by some
refactors in drivers/base/... I suppose I have to setup -mm tree in
addition to Linus', to test -mm builds from time to time for the
purpose of catching these changes myself.
Though, this error happened indeed because nobody cares about
find_bus function nowdays...
I want ask Greg KH and Evgeniy Polyakov: could you together settle
preferred way of accessing bus types? Should we really use
find_bus/bus_find, or Evgeniy would just export w1 bus type? In
later case, I'll remove un-"if 0" find_bus patch, and will
prepare another which will export w1 bus type.
I do not have any preference, both solutions will work.
Thanks,
