I've noticed from the first mail too :-)

do you have anything else connected to the same controller ? I've encountered
a problem a long time ago with SATA drives (it was around 2.4.25, with the
beginning of SATA support), where I could not use RAID on my drives because
simultaneous accesses to the drives was not possible. I then realized that
every time I accessed a drive during a read from or a write to another one
would stall. I don't remember if CDROM access caused the same trouble. This
was with a SATA-patched ata-piix driver, but fortunately this is fixed by now.

Willy
