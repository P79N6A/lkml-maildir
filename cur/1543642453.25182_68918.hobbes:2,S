The "run of the disk tools" that does away with the badblocks is a
lowlevel format; a tedious way to spent ones' time on a harddrive
that will die anyway soon.

Right, which is probably shortly after. Especially on a two years
old drive I wouldn't go through all the troubles to backup 60GB
data, lowlevel format the drive, restore the data and hope the
problems are gone; instead I'd rather get a new drive within the
warranty and cross fingers.
BTW: I did the backup way exactly once and the drive got back to me
with new errors two weeks after.
