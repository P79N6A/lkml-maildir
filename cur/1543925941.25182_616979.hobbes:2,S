Why do you need the file descriptor? 
One of the main problems with perfmon is the complicated user interface.
Naively I would assume just some thread global state should be sufficient.

True probably, although only on CPUs that support PEBS. Dropping features
for old CPUs is unfortunately quite difficult in Linux, and in this case
probably not an option because there are so many of them (e.g. all of AMD
not Fam10h)
