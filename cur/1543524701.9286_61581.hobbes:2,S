Subject: [patch:2.3.42] matroxfb: G400 non-/MAX distinction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Attached is a small patch against 2.3.42 which changes the matroxfb
driver to distinguish between the Matrox G400 MAX and non-MAX cards.
The patch sets maxclk to 300000 for non-MAX and 360000 for MAX cards.
Previously the value was 360000 for all G400, which IMVHO is wrong, since
according to the Matrox website only the MAX supports 360MHz, look at:
   
http://www.matrox.com/mgaweb/products/comp_chart/g400_products.htm
I guess that 360MHz will work on non-max cards, however they might
overheat since AFAIK they are not supplied with a fan on the chip.
Feel free to correct me if I am wrong. (-;
The patch might not be generic enough, so it would be good to hear from
some people whether or not their G400MAX is correctly detected. - Having
said that, it works fine for me. (-:
During init the message for a G400 MAX will be: 
        matroxfb: Millenium G400 MAX (AGP) detected
For a G400 non-MAX the message is (as before):
        matroxfb: unknown G400 (AGP) detected
Regards,
        Anton
