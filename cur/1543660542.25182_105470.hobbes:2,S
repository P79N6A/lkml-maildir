I was planning to go use the qlogic 6.x driver, but only after a test.
For me, the in-kernel driver with the patch from Andrew Patterson is very stable 
on SMP. We'll have to see how the 6.x driver works out.
The in-kernel driver without patch is hopeless on single processor too. Uptime 
of 15 minutes or so when doing a resync, a bit more, but not much more than an 
hour, when doing less intensive IO.
In both cases with the "no handle slots, this should not happen" message. Both 
on Broadcom PIII boards - one Dell, one IBM.
