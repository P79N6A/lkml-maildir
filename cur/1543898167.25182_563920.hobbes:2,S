Hello!
I am not subscribed to this list so please CC answers to my mail
address. THX!
I recently replaced the mainboard of one of my servers with a Tyan
Tomcat K8E. The onboard gigabit NIC is a Broadcom BCM5721. After
compiling and loading the tg3 driver in Kernel 2.6.21.5, the interface
could not be configured: "Device not found".
While searching the net i found a few other people with the same problem
but no solution.
By coincidence i found that a simpe "ifconfig eth1" worked OK and
afterwards the device could be configured and used as desired. After
searching this list, i found this posting
http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0409.0/0224.html
by someone with obviously the same problem.
Has some patch of the driver been reversed or is the hardware buggy?
BTW the chip is connected via PCI Express.
