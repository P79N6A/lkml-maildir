I believe it's going to work like this:
* simple fixes are submitted to Linus and -stable, and are appropriately
  merged.
* complex "correct" fixes too large for -stable are submitted to Linus,
  with a simplified version for -stable.
When the next Linus kernel is released, anything in the previous -stable
series is effectively discarded, and the next -stable series is produced
from the new release point.
Obviously, the -stable sucker can continue with his existing -stable
series if he so wishes, but I would expect that any fixes in, eg,
2.6.11.x would not be propagated by the -stable sucker to 2.6.12.x.
This may be a good thing - it encourages people to get the fixes into
the Linus tree, thereby keeping the code drift to a minimum.  Any
drift would only exist for one of these -stable branches, which may
only survive for maybe one Linus kernel release cycle.
