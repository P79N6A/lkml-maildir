Two things:
1) We're going to make a CVS archive of Linus tree available, automatically
   updated, and we'll rsync it to some public place like kernel.org so you
   can get at the data in a way you want with no BK involved at all.
2) If you beat on our servers with that stupid script, we'll shut down the
   http access.  Give us a break already.
