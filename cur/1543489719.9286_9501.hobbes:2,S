	Does this also work when I play wave files?
	They are much bigger and the waiting points are always the
	read() syscalls of the player.
	I do not think that even RT process priority can influence the wait
	time for a read() syscall when the system is under disk load.
	I will try it at home
	Thanks, have a nice weekend
