Dear Alan and Linus,
Could you consider adding a pointer to our Japanese translation of the
kernel documents somewhere in the the doc subdirectory of the kernel
source tree? We volunteers have translated most of the docs in the
Documentation subdirectory of Linux-2.2.x and 2.4.x in the JF project. 
We now believe our translation will be of great help for Japanese
Linux users and, perhaps, adding a link to our website in the index
file of the doc directory would be appropriate. Two tentative patches
are included below for the two versions of the kernel to make all the
changes needed. Thank you in advance.
Best Regards,
