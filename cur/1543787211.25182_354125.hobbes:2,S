There are two do_mmap_pgoff, one in mm/mmap.c and the other in
mm/nommu.c. It was the mm/nommu.c version that does not  have
a call to __vm_stat_account.
I am not concerned about do_munmap any more from updating
hiwater_vm's concern since the total_vm gets decreased, not increased.

Sounds good to me.
I agreed with you (and Frank) that it makes sense to split hiwater_vm and
hiwater_rss update.

In case you are going to turn hiwater_vm update into a macro and hide it
in a config flag, here is what i have that might be useful.
