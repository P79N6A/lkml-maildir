As I understand it, your nwfs is probably the first filesystem to
have been successfully "ported" to Linux.  Pretty much everything
else (with, perhaps, the exception of the abomination that is the
NTFS driver) started off native.
The multiple times that I have written 30 to 70% of a filesystem,
I found the romfs and minixfs code to be most instructive as a
guide to the VFS interfaces.  The buffer and page cache stuff is
rather harder to track down canonical examples for, though again
minixfs is pretty helpful, if rather simplistic.
Matthew.
