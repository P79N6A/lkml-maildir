Subject: [PATCH] Make sure nobody's leaking resources
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently, releasing a resource also releases all of its children.  That
made sense when request_resource was the main method of dividing up the
memory map.  With the increased use of insert_resource, it seems to me
that we should instead reparent the newly orphaned resources.  Before
we do that, let's make sure that nobody's actually relying on the current
semantics.
