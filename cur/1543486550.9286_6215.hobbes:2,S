Greetings,
When trying to compile the following simple program:
------------------------------
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/vfs.h>
#include <linux/nfs_fs.h>
main()
{
  return 0;
}
------------------------------
..with gcc 2.7.2.3.f.1 and kernel version 2.2.1, the errors at the end of
this message were given.
It seems as though there might be a conflict here.  Is the preceding
simple program false?
thank you,
-Dan
