Sure, but it's not clear to me that you have listened to me saying
*why* it is abuse.
Basically, in my opinion removable media should be handled by insert
and removal detection, not by access detection.  Obviously, there are
some sticky issues with that in the case where media can be removed
without notice (like PC floppies or other manual-eject devices), but
overall I think that is the correct approach.
