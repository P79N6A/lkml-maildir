I'm not sure exactly which vm problems you mean, but He's running the 
suse 2.4.16, which is heavily patched. When your running big production
databases, upgrading to the kernel of the week isn't an option.
I think we've found the bug, it looks like a race in the proc code.
Oliver, someone will contact you a little later with instructions on
getting a kernel with the fix.  If you only see this oops during backups,
make sure you aren't trying to backup /proc.
