Subject: [PATCH][RFC] Time Slice Split Scheduler ...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch implement a scheduler where the concept of dynamic priority is
separated from the concept of time slice, fixing/improving the current
scheduler behavior. The patch is described and is available here :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/lnxsched.html#TsSplit
The same code can be easily merged inside the Balanced Multi Queue Scheduler
by keeping a per CPU rcl_curr variable.
I'm currently running this code on my machine and it behaves very well,
that means that when i run pine, it starts.
Comments ranging from "outstanding !!" down to "this code stink" are welcome.
