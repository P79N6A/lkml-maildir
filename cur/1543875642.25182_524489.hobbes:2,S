	Hi Maneesh -- I will start testing with the patch you provided. If you 
come up with any further issues please let me know. Also, if you could 
suggest some additional BUG() lines that I could insert I would 
appreciate it. Since the bug is hard to reproduce, it may be easier to 
catch a race condition in the making via BUG() than an actual failure 
due to a race condition.
	Thanks!
	-- Ethan
