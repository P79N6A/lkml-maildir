Which is what I have done.  I worked on it because no "real" kernel
developer seemed willing to solve it.  Having worked on other kernels
in an "earlier lifetime", I have *no* desire to do that any more.  I
would much rather write audio software.
But, the lack of this feature has been a continual impediment for
years now.  It affects not just me, but most other serious Linux audio
developers and many of our users.  We need a simple way for users to
configure a Digital Audio Workstation without having to run large,
complex, insecure audio applications as `root'.  Our competition runs
on Windows and Mac systems where no such configuration is needed.
Statements of the form "had I cared enough to do something about this
problem, I would have implemented it differently" are not much help.
This patch is small and clean.  It meshes with existing kernel LSM
mechanisms.  It solves a real problem affecting many Linux desktop
users.
I respectfully request that it be accepted for inclusion in 2.6.11.
