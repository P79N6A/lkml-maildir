Hi, 
  There was a bug some time back in a Must-Fix list regarding UDP
applications going in dead lock.
  (
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/must-fix/must-fix-2.txt
 )
  Here is an extract:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- UDP apps can in theory deadlock, because the ip_append_data path can end
  up sleeping while the socket lock is held.
  It is OK to sleep with the socket held held, normally.  But in this case
  the sleep happens while waiting for socket memory/space to become
  available, if another context needs to take the socket lock to free up the
  space we could hang.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the fix present in the kernel now? I faced a problem similar to this one.
 
 Thanks in advance,
 Adhiraj.
