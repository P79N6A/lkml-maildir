True, but how about the following (from one I had to merge recently):
 Q> patch1:
 Q> @@ 137,3 142,5
 Q>  for( ptr=head; *ptr; ptr=ptr->next ) {
 Q> +   ctr += ptr->qty;
 Q>     table[ctr] += ptr->qty;
 Q> +   total += table[ctr];
 Q>  }
 Q> patch2:

 Q>  for( ptr=head; *ptr; ptr=ptr->next ) {

 Q>     table[ctr] += ptr->qty;
How would you merge those two patches?

If it does that, then it does all you need. Assume, for example, that
you have two patches to ORIGINAL.DOC that overlap each other, these
being PATCH1.DIFF and PATCH2.DIFF respectively...
 Q> gzip -9 < ORIGINAL.DOC > ORIGINAL.DOC.GZ
 Q> patch < PATCH1.DIFF
 Q> mv ORIGINAL.DOC ORIGINAL.DOC.V1
 Q> gunzip < ORIGINAL.DOC.GZ > ORIGINAL.DOC
 Q> patch < PATCH2.DIFF
 Q> mv ORIGINAL.DOC ORIGINAL.DOC.V2
At this point, you have copies of the patched versions of that file as
produced by the two patches separately. If my memory's right (I don't
have diff3 to hand) you then do...
 Q> diff3 ORIGINAL.DOC.V1 ORIGINAL.DOC.V2 REVISED.DOC
...and end up with REVISED.DOC being the result of taking ORIGINAL.DOC
and applying both PATCH1.DIFF and PATCH2.DIFF in parallel. You can
then do...
 Q> gunzip < ORIGINAL.DOC.GZ > ORIGINAL.DOC
 Q> diff -u ORIGINAL.DOC REVISED.DOC
...to get a consolidated diff that applies both patches.
Best wishes from Riley.
