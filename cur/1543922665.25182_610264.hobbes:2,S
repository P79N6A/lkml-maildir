The abovce disables the prompt but 
arch/x86_64/Kconifg.x86_64 set the value to y so EARLY_PRINTK is
always enabled (see answer I wrote to Kay).
This patchset leaves room for futher clean-up which is
welcome. The aim was to unify the two Kconfig.debug file
where Randy did a quick and good job. The aim was not
maximum unification of the Kconfig files used for the two
ARCH's this comes later - and there are much to be done
here.
Please let me know if you see other issues woth the patch serie.
