That was my point, -- people don't realize it is dangerous not to handle
throttle, and in fact it was not that dangerous before new tty buffering
has been implemented. I do handle throttle in my driver, but it has been
implemented as a part of work-around for the deficiencies of the old tty
buffering. I seriously doubt I'd realize it's a must to honour throttle
should I start to write the driver today.
