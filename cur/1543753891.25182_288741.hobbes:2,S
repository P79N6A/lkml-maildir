That's the same as the case of the debugger dying or being killed by hand.
When gdb has a bug, people want to be able to kill it and get on with using
their program, not have their program always be killed too.
If you add this feature, it makes most sense IMHO to use PTRACE_SETOPTIONS
as the way to request it.  
Thanks,
Roland
