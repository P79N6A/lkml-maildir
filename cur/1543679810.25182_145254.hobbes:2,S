Tried that before. Before I thought it was the kswapd problem (see list).
But a few hours after I thought it was fixed, bamm it did it again.
I have monitored ps via this script, but I never see anything out of the
ordinary. I will try again and send a copy to the other guy who is having
the problem to see what results we get.
