I think *requiring* a binding to ethernet devices is a bad idea. 
For example, on many MPC8260 embedded systems, the MII bus is controlled
by GPIO pins, not an ethernet MDIO system.
Some applications may use the MII bus to control non-PHY devices, such
as Broadcom ethernet switches. I'm working for a general MII bus that
ethernet PHYs and other devices can all use.
