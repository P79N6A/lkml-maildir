Hi,
I am using atxp1 module to change vcore on my NForce2 via userspace daemon
(see punnoor.de). Currently atxp1 module will write to the log on every vcore
change, thus filling up my log - which I don't want. I am no kernel coder, but
I guess, this one-liner will change this behaviour in a wanted way, ie output
will be made for debug purposes only. (Please use the attached patch, if
inlined one got fsked up by TB.)
Cheers,
Prakash
