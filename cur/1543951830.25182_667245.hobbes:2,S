Subject: [PATCH 2.6.24] Increase the number of PnP memory resources from 12 to 24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Increase the number of PnP memory resources from 12 to 24.
This removes an "exceeded the max num of mem resources" warning on boot. I
also noticed the reservation of two more iomem ranges on the computer on
which this was tested.
