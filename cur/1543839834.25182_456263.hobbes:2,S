Very cool.
I guess I'm not concerned about what the expire timeout is for such trees 
either as it's not my problem.
I'll have to play around with these a bit to work out how I can recognize 
them in the export list. Hopefully it will be straight forward.

Yep.
Again, not my problem if I treat fsid filesets as the automount unit.

Yep. But also not my problem as user activity will make this happen 
automagically.

Yep. No use in stepping on NFSs toes when he just wants to make my life
