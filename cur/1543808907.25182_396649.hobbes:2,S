For this one, it would be interesting to see more info about the working 
setup. Notably
 - what modules are loaded by the time X is running
 - any differences in 'dmesg' output from 2.6.15 to 16-rc1 (PCI allocation 
   issues should show up there)
I don't see any real differences in the radeonfb driver, for example 
(there's some trivial cleanup, including things like speeling fixums, but 
nothing that looks remotely likely).
Of course, in a perfect world, we'd have serial or network console 
output.. X crashes are nastier than most, if only because the console is 
mostly gone.
