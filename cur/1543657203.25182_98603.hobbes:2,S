My bad ... I meant "every" kind of device doing memory mapped I/O, which
is all that had been mentioned so far.  This needs to work on more than
just the "platform bus"; "layered busses" shouldn't need special casing,
they are just as common.  You had mentioned SCSI busses; USB, FireWire,
and others also exist.  (Though I confess I still don't like BUG() as a
way to fail much of anything!)
That's likely a better way to present one of my points:  if it's "generic",
then it must work on more than just the lowest level platform bus.

That's not consistent with what I thought what you said.  USB devices
use memory mapped I/O, so this should work.  (And using BUG instead
of returning null still seems wrong...)
However, we could agree that some kind of dma_malloc() should exist !!

Please look at the 2.5.53 tree with my "usbcore dma updates (and doc)"
patch, which Greg has now merged and submitted to Linus.
The pre-existing USB DMA API syntax did not change, so it looks only
"something" like what you wrote there.
