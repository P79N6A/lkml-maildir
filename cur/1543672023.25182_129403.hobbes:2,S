Subject: wrong screen size with fbcon [2.5.68]

I posted about this when 2.5.68 was released but very few people 
responded.
While using the framebuffer console driver, I seems that the screen is 
set to something like 1024x775 instead of 1024x768. I cannot see the 
bottom of my screen that is...
I just checked the latest bk taken from kernel.org and still hasn't been 
fixed.
The fb console was working perfectly till 2.5.67.
If it is of any relevance, I'm using an nvidia tnt2 card. Has nobody 
noticed this problem?
