I've seen a lot of verbosity out of SCSI messages, but I haven't seen a 
straightforward interpretation of the problem in there. It's all 
information useful for debugging, not information useful for system 
administration.

On the other hand, bringing the system down because a device is 
misbehaving is a poor idea. I've personally recovered most of the data off 
of a dying drive because the system was willing to let me keep using the 
drive anyway; IIRC, the drive didn't work at all after a reboot, so I 
would have lost all the data instead of only a little had the system 
insisted on a perfectly functioning drive in order to use it at all.
There ought to be some middle ground between doing nothing until the 
computer really breaks and breaking the computer before then, but that's 
an issue not specific to libata.
