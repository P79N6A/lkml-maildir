Actually, games aren't really usefull to evaluate scheduler performance, due 
to their bursty nature.
OTOH, gears runs full throttle, including any of its bottlenecks. In fact, 
it's the bottlenecks that add to its realism.  It exposes underlying 
scheduler hickups visually, unless buffered by the display-driver, in which 
case you just use the vesa-driver to be sure.
If gears starts to flicker on you, just slow it down with a cpu hog like:
	# while :; do :; done &
Add as many hogs as you need to make the hickups visible.
Again, these hickups are only visible when using uneven nice+ levels.
BTW, another way to show these hickups would be through some kind of a 
cpu/proc timing-tracer.  Do we have something like that?
Thanks!
