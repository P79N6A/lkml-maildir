Since this seems to be related to CPU down event, you could run a
tight loop like this overnight (for all CPUs in the system):
	while :
	do
		echo 0 > online
		echo 1 > online
	done
This, maybe in conjunction with some other test like LTP or make -jN bzImage,
is usually enough to capture all CPU-hotplug related problems.
