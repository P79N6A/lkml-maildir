This patch series supports using the new GB pages introduced with 
AMD Quad Cores for the kernel direct mapping.
I addressed all reasonable feedback for the previous version I believe.
Changes against previous version:
- Ported on top of latest git-x86 with PAT series
- Fixed some white space
- Clarify clear_kernel_mapping comments
- Minor cleanups
