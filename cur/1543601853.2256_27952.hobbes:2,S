It's trivial to do that, of course, but if someone needs an
automated way to do it (several times, easy lookup), you can
try  
http://www.osdlab.org/sw_resources/scripts/ksysmap
 .
Usage is:  ksysmap [system_map_file] offset
and it spits out address/symbol before offset, exact match if
present, and address/symbol after offset.
Example:
[rddunlap@dragon linux]$ ksysmap ./System.map-249acpi c012e052
ksysmap: searching './System.map-249acpi' for 'c012e052'
c012df20 T sys_truncate
c012e052 ..... <<<<<
c012e0a0 T sys_ftruncate
