The BUG you hit should not corrupt anything, that debugging code is
actually there to prevent silent corruption due to lack of locking.
It is likely you are using an fsck version that can't read the 3.6.x
format.  They are still packaging the beta fsck tool for the new format,
I'm not sure the exact download URL yet.
When you mount the FS it tells you which version it is, please include that
info as well.
