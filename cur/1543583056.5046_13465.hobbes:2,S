Ah, too bad. Union mounts would have been really elegant (allowing the
operation to be repeated without residues, and also allowing umounting
of the covered FS as a sanity check). But I guess there's no way to
implement them without performance penalty ...

Probably not ... the only interesting case would be if you could completely
umount it.

Okay, I'll have a look.

Agreed on all three counts. Also, change_root might just die by evolution,
just like most of NFS-root-from-initrd (using change_root) died.
What we need is a migration plan. Right now, it seems that most people
still use change_root. Hopefully they read the little message I left them
in linux/Documentation/initrd.txt:
  Current kernels still support it, but you should _not_ rely on its
  continued availability.
So with some luck, distributors will switch to pivot_root sometime soon,
when deploying 2.4. So if we drop all the old junk in 2.5, the amount of
letter bombs should be small ;-)

Since you've already done all the work ... ;-) It's good if we can make
one change at a time.
