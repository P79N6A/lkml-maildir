Is Rohit's intended to be a late 2.6.14 fix?  We seem to have done well
without it for several years, and are just on the point of changing to
prefaulting the hugetlb pages anyway, which will fix it up.

(I'm not surprised that the low-level arch code fixes this up as part of the
fault handling.  I am surprised that it does so only after giving the fault
to the kernel.  Sounds like something's gone wrong.)
What happens when the hugetlb file is truncated down and back up after
the mmap?  Truncating down will remove a page from the mmap and flush TLB.
Truncating up will let accesses to the gone page pass the valid...off test.
But we've no support for hugetlb faulting in this version: so won't it get
get stuck in a tight loop?
If it's decided that this issue is actually an ia64 one, and does need to
be fixed right now, then I'd have thought your idea of fixing it at the
ia64 end better: arch/ia64/mm/fault.c already has code for discarding
faults on speculative loads, and ia64 has an RGN_HPAGE set aside for
hugetlb, so shouldn't it just discard speculative loads on that region?
