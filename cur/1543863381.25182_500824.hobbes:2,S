I actually had patches to do "split active lists" a while back.
They worked by lazily moving the page at reclaim-time, based on
whether or not it is mapped. This isn't too much worse than the
kernel's current idea of what a mapped page is.
They actually got a noticable speedup of the swapping kbuild
workload, but at this stage there were some more basic
improvements needed, so the difference could be smaller today.
The other nice thing about it was that it didn't have a hard
cutoff that the current reclaim_mapped toggle does -- you could
opt to scan the mapped list at a lower ratio than the unmapped
one. Of course, it also has some downsides too, and would
require retuning...
