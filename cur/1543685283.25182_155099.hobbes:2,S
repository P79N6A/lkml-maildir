Sorry, but that option is not available in my bios setup.
Besides, fixing the problem is usually better than a workaround.
Motherboard: Tyan MPX (S2466-4M) with latest bios.
Chipset: AMD 760MPX, 762, 768, Winbond 83627
Software: Slackware 9.0 with some updates.
Let me know if I can be of any assistance.
Thanks,
  Russ
