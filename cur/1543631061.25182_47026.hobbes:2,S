well, then you should be worried first for the whole /proc/slabinfo, not
just the bh heahders :) if it's a problem for the bh, it's a problem for
everything else.
The reason fragmentation is never a problem is that as far as the
persistent slab objects can be reclaimed dynamically by the vm we will
always be able to free all the slab pages, the only downside we run into
vs being aware of the slab fragmentation, is that we risk to reclaim
more objects than necessary at the layer above the slab cache (so at the
bh layer), but dropping more bh than necessary will never be a problem
(Andrew wants to drop them all indeed).

less fragmentation because of zero bh allocated from slab cache :).
