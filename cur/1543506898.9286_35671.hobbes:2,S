Many thanks for the suggestion. I have to admit that I hadnae thought
of that method, which is unusual for me...
However, I've found a set of config options (with the 2.2.10 kernel)
that produces a 1.3M bzImage file, and am using that as my testbed. So
far, my tweaked source isn't booting, so the patch isn't ready for
prime time yet, but it will be soon...
Best wishes from Riley.
