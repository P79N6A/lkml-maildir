Right.

Right.
Both could happen because of the new spin_unlock implementation that doesn't
take anymore the lock on the bus:
	#define spin_unlock_string \
		"movb $1,%0"
With the previous `lock ; btrl' 4) couldn't happen with pending
writes on the write buffer because spin_unlock was a full barrier too...
Alpha was safe because it has to imply an mb() in spin_unlock (but
sparc64 was hurted too for example).
As you say the problematic construct is not used anymore into 2.4.0-test12-pre2
in filemap.c so such deadlock can't happen anymore but it's been useful that
you pointing out the problem, thanks.
