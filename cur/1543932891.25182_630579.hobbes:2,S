I mean 'perhaps'.  I'm not sure I remember what the race was, so I can't
evaluate whether or not the same race crops up in AFS too.  So: can you
describe the race please.

Someone might already have read-access via mmap at the point someone attempts
to write to an mmapped region.  That means that I'd have to revoke the read
access of the first someone before letting the write take place.
Does NFS do this?

Because then there can be a race over who gets to flush the dead write.
Actually, this may no longer be a problem with your write_begin() changes.
I'll need to have another look at those.
Besides, I don't agree that invalidate_inode_pages2() is necessarily the right
way to do things.
