hmm I should of cause have thought of this earlier - it does indeed
seam that the controller does not handle parallel traffic very well
-----------
dkstorage01:~# hdparm -t /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  112 MB in  3.02 seconds =  37.09 MB/sec
dkstorage01:~# hdparm -t /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  108 MB in  3.02 seconds =  35.76 MB/sec

Bonnie test shows the same picture.

Yeah so it is properly just a poor controller.
