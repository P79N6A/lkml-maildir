Just for telling you what has caused my cpu to spin down all the time. 
it looks like the acpi was right to tell me that the laptop got very 
hot, i just didn't notice cause the air out of the laptop wasn't hot, 
this was because some dust was somewhere in the fan/heatpipe which 
caused the machine to overheat. now i know a bit more, acpi was right in 
throttling the cpu, thank god for acpi ;)
cya and keep on the good work
