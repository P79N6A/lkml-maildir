Added a journal to my root disk.
Mounted it ext3.
Found it scaled like crap
set my fstab back to ext2
/dev/sda2       /               ext2    defaults,errors=remount-ro      0   1
reboot.
Disk says it's mounted ext2 ("mount\n")
Still performs like crap.
Mmmmm ... it STILL mounts ext3.
Allegedly this is a "feature".
Can we please remove this stupidity?
If I say I want ext2, I want ext2 ....
M.
