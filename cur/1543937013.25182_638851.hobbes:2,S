Bum.  We established that once you fix the accessors+sign extension bug, 
there's another bug somewhere later on in the series.  Any chance you 
could move "x86/pgtable: fix constant sign extension problem" to be just 
after "x86/pgtable: unify pagetable accessors" and bisect the following 
patches?
Thanks,
