     Well, those of you who have seen my postings before are probably familiar
with my Sparc-32 SMP stability problems.
     To summarize, 4/670MP with quad Ross Hypersparc CPU's, 384MB of RAM,
and a 10-base-T/SCSI combo card runs totally stable under 2.2.13 as long as I
don't try to turn up two ethernet interfaces.
     SS-10 on the other hand won't run for more than a few hours before
spin_lock hell.  This is moving the exact same CPU modules, video card, and
SCSI controller that are completely stable in the 4/670MP.
     Today I tried two things; I got an SS-20 chassis and tried that. 
Unfortunately, same spin_lock() hell, it seemed to happen even faster actually,
longest uptime was 59 minutes. 
     When I've bothered David about this before, answer I got was "Get an
Ultra"..  Ok, maybe that's truncated a bit but that's what it amounted to.  So
I got an Ultra-1.  Probably not a screamer but if I can find a stable platform
that doesn't raise the room temperature ten degrees I'll be elated. 
     I was under the impression that the same kernel that would boot on an
SS-10 would also boot on the Ultras.  So I hooked up the disks that were
connected to the 4/670MP / SS-10 / SS-20, to the Ultra-1 and attempted to boot.
     The cursor spins but then before even getting the SILO prompt I get:
	Fast Data Access MMU Miss
     ... and it returns to the PROM prompt.
     I tried booting a RedHat 6.0 CD and it boots fine.  But I don't want to
wipe out everything I have and start over.  Since it doesn't even get to the
SILO prompt I assume this is SILO related?
     Can anybody tell me what I need to do to get this machine to boot and run
or do I have to re-install Linux and recompile all of my software?
