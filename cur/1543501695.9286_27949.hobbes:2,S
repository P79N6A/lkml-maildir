Hi Alan,
Sorry for spreading misinformation about the K6 ;-)
I'll collect this with the Cyrix info I have and send a patch to Richard
Gooch for a new multi-vendor Documentation/mtrr.txt. 
I think your comments below just about cover the AMD specifics.  Anything
else that AMD users need to know about setting their mtrr? 
	Cheers,
