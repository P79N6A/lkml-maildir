OK, anything else good?
That "UNIX" term is very negative. People often associate it with
SCO OpenServer, Wyse terminals, and 60 people on a 386. The UNIX
that people know is just awful. It looks something like this:
# less foo
sh: command not found
# more foo
sh: command not found
# emacs foo
sh: command not found
# ed foo
0
help
?
quit
?
exit
?
DIE!!!!!!!!!!
?
Linux needs to be seen as an OS all by itself, not just another
crummy UNIX clone. Every MSCE knows that UNIX is a legacy operating
system. No problem, Linux is not UNIX. Linux is new! fun! cool!!!
Most importantly, Linux is alive.

Maybe UltraSPARC is worth mentioning, since it is a new feature.
Keep in mind that normal people just won't be interested.
Your list of processor types is confusing technical jargon to them.
ARM, MIPS, and 680x0 are definitely not good to mention.
One has to draw the line somewhere.
