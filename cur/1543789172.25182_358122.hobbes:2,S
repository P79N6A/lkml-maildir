Does anyone know how many of these we have? We are moving /sys/block
to /sys/class so many of these will require upgrades anyway. Could
libsysfs hide some of the changes? I have not looked at libsysfs at
all though...
Btw, is your proposal with moving it all into /sys/device less drastic?

I really do not see why you think that "ieee1394_node" and
"ieee1394_transport" are natural names while "ieee1394/node" and
"ieee1394/transport" are "artificial".

Why is "interfaces" is more magic than "wireless"? Is it just the name
that is confusing? We could call it "netifs", "netdevs", "devices" -
just pick a name you like better.

Well, it is rather simple I think - if it works with hardware and
needs power management then it's a physical device. If it just a
kernel abstraction/API for group of similar objects then it is a class
device. Physical device can only have one driver, class device can
have several interfaces/views. So far we have input interfaces and
SCSI generic interface.

Could you tell me which ones you consider virtual buses?

Having hierarchy in the /sys/devices is nice and I think I agree with it.
I don't think it will reslve any confusion for the coder WRT
physical/virtual devices - after all I think you just need to change
class_device kset from class's to devices and that will "move" the
object into the new spot in /sys tree.
However having class hierarchy spelled out is also nice because it
_does exist_. Right now we just encode it with common prefixes in the
class names.
