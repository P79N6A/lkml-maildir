OK so we have a redundancy. You can get the same info from MPS and from
the lapic itself.
The fact that ACPI's boot tables does not include the lapic id (just its
address) suggests strongly to me that we should similarly query the
lapic for its address instead of writing in a new value when using the
MPS tables, as well.

Agree.
