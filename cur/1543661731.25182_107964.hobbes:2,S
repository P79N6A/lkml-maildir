Not sure. 
With contest 0.60, io_load, ext3, with the scheduler changes:
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 161 user: 181 system: 16
Finished io_load: elapsed: 162 user: 0 system: 17 loads: 9
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 155 user: 179 system: 15
Finished io_load: elapsed: 155 user: 0 system: 17 loads: 9
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 166 user: 180 system: 15
Finished io_load: elapsed: 166 user: 0 system: 18 loads: 10
With the CPU scheduler changes backed out:
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 137 user: 181 system: 14
Finished io_load: elapsed: 138 user: 0 system: 9 loads: 5
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 142 user: 181 system: 14
Finished io_load: elapsed: 142 user: 0 system: 9 loads: 5
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 133 user: 181 system: 15
Finished io_load: elapsed: 133 user: 0 system: 12 loads: 7
So there's some diminution there, not a lot.
With no_load:
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 108 user: 179 system: 12
Finished no_load: elapsed: 108 user: 7 system: 12 loads: 0
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 107 user: 179 system: 13
Finished no_load: elapsed: 107 user: 7 system: 12 loads: 0
Finished compiling kernel: elapsed: 110 user: 178 system: 12
Finished no_load: elapsed: 110 user: 8 system: 14 loads: 0
It's very good either way.  Probably with the scheduler changes we're
hitting a better balance.
