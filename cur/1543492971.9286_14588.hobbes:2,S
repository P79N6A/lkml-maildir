That is somewhat inaccurate and misleading.  The whole point of
capabilities *is* to make privileges independent of account
management, and part of that is to remove automatic association of
privileges with any one user account.  As you note, a recommendation
that we preserve the super-user account is really only valid as a
temporary migration helper.

It is much more than that: it is to prevent privileges leaking, so
that bugs in these daemons do not compromise the security of other
parts of the OS.

Sure, but that misses the point: we _do_ want to keep an
administrator.  We do _not_ want the administrator account to have
full privileges.
In a capabilities environment, the way the admin account gains
privileges is through the filesystem, not through any privileged
accounts in the kernel.  Typically you will have a set of utilities
with extra privileges enabled in them somewhere on the filesystem, and
only the admin accounts will have execute access to those utilities.
For example, you might have a shell binary with full privileges
enabled: that shell would be executable only by the admin account (not
necessarily root).  You might have a shell with fewer privileges
enabled, but owned by (and executable by) the whole admin group, or
utilities executable by the operator group.
So you still have admin users: in fact, you can have multiple admin
users and groups, each with different levels of privilege.  However,
the uids and gids themselves are not automatically privileged in the
kernel.
