You need a file system to put files on any media.

And your memory leaks are saved, your saved structure isnt platform portable.
The pointers in it go bad if they point to transient objects someone else
has.

Thats fine. You still need journalling , you still need recovery from
corruption. 20Gig is a lot of cosmic rays etc 8)
All that changes is the disk layout becomes a little less important.
