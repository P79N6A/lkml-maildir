You are been very right not trying yesterday night one ;)

My not too much careful thought is that we need to waste some time before
sending the ack in order to optimize TCP behavior. But for raw iteractive
performance we need to disable this timeout. My latest patch (the one send
some minutes ago) does this disabling completly delayed acks if
TCP_NODELAY is set (at least this was my intention, I hope to havn't done
mistakes, I have a little time to play with these high-tech issues...). So
it would be interesting (at least to me) if you could give a try to my
last patch and setting TCP_NODELAY.
BTW, cool and very productive report ;). Thanks.
