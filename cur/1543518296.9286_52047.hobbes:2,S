Andries,
I see that class is back in session.  Would it be faster to write a
textbook and make us pay for LU (Linux University) course credit??
David,
Please trust that Andries is correct.
cat /proc/ide/hda/geometry
physical     26853/16/63
logical      1684/255/63
raw          16383/16/63
current      16383/16/63
These are additions that I put into a kernel to show folks that Andries is
correct and telling the truth.
I own Andries an endless apology for that mess of mapping physical->raw
and logical->current.
