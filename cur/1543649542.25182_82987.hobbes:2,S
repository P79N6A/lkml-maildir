Nope.  Mine didn't get to shutdown.  Basically the whole system went
nuts - I couldn't run commands other than shell builtins, eth0
transmit timeouts, IDE complaining about attempts to access beyond the
end of device.  I couldn't do a proper shutdown - hard to sudo
shutdown -r now when you can execute anything.
The first thing to show in the log was:
Oct 22 06:27:40 hagbard kernel: is_tree_node: node level 0 does not match to the expected one 1
Oct 22 06:27:40 hagbard kernel: vs-5150: search_by_key: invalid format found in block 2162976. Fsck?

Oct 22 06:27:40 hagbard kernel: vs-13070: reiserfs_read_locked_inode: i/o failure occurred trying to find stat data of [1040516 1315261 0x0 SD]
Oct 22 06:27:40 hagbard kernel: is_tree_node: node level 269 does not match to the expected one 1
after 3 seconds of that:
Oct 22 06:27:43 hagbard kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Oct 22 06:27:43 hagbard kernel: ide0(3,2): rw=0, want=928907664, limit=6152895
Oct 22 06:27:43 hagbard kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Oct 22 06:27:43 hagbard kernel: ide0(3,2): rw=0, want=1208618096, limit=6152895
which went on for a few iterations, then:
Oct 22 06:28:33 hagbard kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Oct 22 06:28:33 hagbard kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out: status 0150  0c00 at 3896/3957 command 00001622.
Oct 22 06:29:23 hagbard kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Oct 22 06:29:23 hagbard kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out: status 0150  0c00 at 3958/4018 command 00020000.
Interestingly enough, reiserfs didn't complain on reboot.  it was only
the root fs (on ext2/3) that complained - and had lots of problems.
