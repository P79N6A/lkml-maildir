This function badly needs a kerneldoc description.  Also I can't say
I like the name a lot, but without a clearly better idea I should
probably not complain :)
We should at least add a generic_ prefix to indicate it's a generic
helper valid for most filesystem (and the kerneldoc comment can explain
the details)
