That's a pretty ridiculous assertion!  When you have a kernel
filesystem mounted, it belongs to the kernel.  However, in the past
Linux has allowed the boot block -- not being used by the in-kernel
filesystem -- to be accessed via the block device.  Breaking this
without introducing an API to write the boot block was a bad idea.

There operations don't change a thing.  At all.  They're not merely
overkill, they're useless.  You're changing tires because you're out
of gas.
