I think in_irq() and in_interrupt() should check the cpu interrupt flag
and return TRUE if the per-cpu interrupts are disabled.
The current behavious is just weird:
    spin_lock_bh();
    in_interrupt(); --> true
    spin_unlock_bh();
    spin_lock_irq();
    in_interrupt(); --> false
    spin_unlock_irq();

It should be possible to detect that automatically: if
dev_kfree_skb_any() is called outside irq context with disabled per-cpu
interrupts then it's probably due to a spin_lock_irq() and could
deadlock.
