Yes.

Depends on how much you trust firmware :-). In the worst case, it
could create one such entry for each bus.
I noticed this because I worked on picking up resources for root
bridges from firmware recently, and noticed more than one system
in which firmware created ~10 entries for resources that were
adjacent to each other and could be coalesced into a single
resource range. Not illegal, just not optimal.
