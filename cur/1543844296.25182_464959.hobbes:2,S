I think it's a RAM problem. Most 386DX and early 486 boards allowed
32 MB (using 4 MB modules),  Linux 2.6 should run fine on such
a beast (386SX was limited to 16 MB address space). Later 486 boards
using DIMMs, I think, supported 64 MB (with caching).
Of course a "6 bogomips" 386 CPU isn't a speed daemon but in early
1990s it wasn't any faster and people were using them commonly (and,
I think, comfortably). IMHO for basic "SOHO Internet server" (mail
and such) it could be fast enough running Linux 2.6.
