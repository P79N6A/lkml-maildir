Hi all,
I hope this document can get into the kernel tree.  As I read through
the discussion about Japanese translation, there are quite some
arguments that one cannot do kernel development effectively without
solid English skill.  As a non-native English speaker, I would say that
it is much easier to understand technical terms and effectively discuss
technical matters.  But community policies and politics are different
things.  They will be very painful for one who doesn't really grasp
English well.  IMHO, having these policy documents in different
languages will greatly help these non-native speakers to contribute,
hence greatly benefit the Linux kernel community itself.
