Hi Linus,
please pull from: 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git release
This fixes three regressions, two small ones from within 2.6.22,
and a boot hang due to a race condition originating in 2.6.20.
It will update the files shown below.
thanks!
-Len

    ACPI: fix 2.6.20 SMP boot regression
    
    Always disable/enable interrupts in the acpi idle routine,
    even in the error path.
    
    This is required as the 2.6.20 change in git commit d331e739f5ad2aaa9...
    "Fix interrupt race in idle callback" expects the idle handler
    to enable interrupt before returning.
    
    There was a case in acpi idle routine, in which interrupt was not being
    enabled before return, which caused the system to hang at bootup, while
    enabling C-states on an SMP system.
    
    The signature of the hang was that "processor.nocst"
    was required to enable boot.

    ACPICA: fix error path in new external package objects as method arguments
    
    In the routine acpi_ut_create_package_object(), if the
    ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED() fails then ACPI_FREE(package_desc) is called as
    part of the cleanup.  This should instead be
    acpi_ut_remove_reference(package_desc) in order to remove the reference
    acquired from acpi_ut_create_internal_object() [see the routine
    acpi_ut_create_buffer_object() as an example of proper functionality].
