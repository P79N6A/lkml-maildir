And I cannot seriosly believe that you are cappable of reading his
examples. Megabananas are a ridiculous demonstration becase of the
object beeing counted itself, but if you take stuff from real life then
I doubt that you expect a kilometer to be 1024 meters. Same for
kilogram. And a megatone is not 1048576 tones, even not 104857600 kg,
and not 107374182400 grams. Wanna more stupid examples created by
abusing decimal units?

You talk for everybody, or is it just your (and only your) mind refusing
to accept new terms? For my taste, kib and mib are even easier to
speech, easier than {KiLoBytE} resp. {MeGaBytE} or KaaaBe / eMmmBe.
