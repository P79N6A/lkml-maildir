Thanks, it really was a long ago.  With the above included in
drivers/char/defkeymap.map and regenerating defkeymap.c_shipped
with loadkeys (kbd-1.08 recompiled with include/linux/keyboard.h
that comes with 2.6 kernel), things started work again.
Is there a reason not to include the above "keycode 183" line in
the shipped source (both defkeymap.map and defkeymap.c_shipped)?
The 2.6 kernel without it can be seem as a feature degradation
from 2.4 for 86/106 keyboard users, and I would like to know if
there is a case where having that line hurts.  Is "keycode 183"
generated for completely different characters on other national
keyboards, and having that line is a feature degradation for
users of such keyboards?  I have access to only 101, 86, and 106
keyboards so I cannot test this myself.  Or maybe there are
other reasons to leave the default keymap as minimal as it
currently is in 2.6 tree?
