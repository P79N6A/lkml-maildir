I'm not defending the default 2.2 behaviour for a moment. :) With at
most one foreground task at a time and one constant background task, we
should always be able to schedule the interactive wakeups onto the idle
CPU.  As soon as you have two foreground tasks at once, that may no
longer be possible.
