I thought he may mean an option that would apply the patch to a normal
kernel. That way the patch would be matched against the distributed kernel,
but the kernel would NOT have the patch already applied.
This would have eliminated the "will affect kernel maintainance" reason,
and would not be any worse than the user having to download the patch, apply
it, and build. It would, at least, promise that the patch would apply
correctly (without patch errors), and the resulting kernel should (but not
always) run. A most "experimental" option ever.
