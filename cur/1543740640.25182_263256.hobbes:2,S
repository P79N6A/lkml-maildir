I don't think these problems are still relevant to the current sources,
though some of them might still occur in 2.6.9.  The fix I posted for the
semantics bugs of exec vs pending signals makes de_thread not abandon the
old signal_struct at all, so it holds on to all the data structures.  If
you can reproduce any kind of leak using the code now in Linus's tree,
please show me the details.
Thanks,
Roland
