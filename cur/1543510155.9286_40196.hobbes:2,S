Alan suggested both, first BLKFLSBUF and then BLKRRPART I did this in
the eject code and if I do it soft like it ends in an infinite loop. So
I only did the BLKFLSBUF. The infinite loop was/is caused due to the
fact that the drive pulls in the already ejected dev. If I do it
manually it works, means push the 'eject button', but sending the
command eject again it spits out the media and then it pulls it in to BLKRRPART.
Well I have to play what's best... But anyway I feel much better than before.
(A cheaper solution would have been to throw away the old drive, but
then I wouldn't have the experiences I have now!!)
(eject code from Jeff!!)
Yours I have to try out tomorrow...
Thanks 
Andreas
