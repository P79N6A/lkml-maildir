   If you do create such a patch, please also state that HIGHMEM64G is
necessary for support of the NX bit (on those processors that support
it).
   ISTR that a similar issue exists in the NOHIGHMEM case, where some
150MB or so of RAM would be unusable in a 1GB machine with NOHIGHMEM.
I could be mis-remembering, that, though.
