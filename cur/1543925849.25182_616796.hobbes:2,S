The "limit" added in the code below,
which was for messages of this form:
    hub 1-1:1.0: hub_port_status failed (err = -71)
    last message repeated 347 times

I'm not yet sure what's happening on resume now,
but there's this huge long pause with a dark screen
and then suddenly the USB subsystem comes to life
(my mouse lights up) and the system finally resumes.
More when I know more.  But it doesn't happen every time,
or even most times, so git-bisect is not possible either.
This one actually requires a developer/maintainer to put
in some effort and think about things.  Currently, that's me.
