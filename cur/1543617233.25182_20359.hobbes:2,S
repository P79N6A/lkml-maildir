The real question is: what can get in.
Variants of the explicit scheduling points have been around for over a year, 
since Ingo's original version.  Just a few days ago Marcello once again said 
that if all the patch does is add scheduling points, he had no intention of 
integrating it.  Linus's opinion on the matter has pretty much been about the 
same since Ingo's version.
If explicit scheduling points ARE a better first step than preempt (which 
doesn't necessarily elminate preempt, it just lets us move forward while 
arguing), when the heck might they possibly appear in a mainline kernel we 
don't have to manually patch each new release of?
