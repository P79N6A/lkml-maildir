I get oopses too when I use kernels compiled for athlon on my redhat
7.1, athlon 850 system.  runs rock solid when I compile for i686.  I
assumed the athlon optimizations in the kernel were broken, or gcc's
athlon optimization was, as I seem to recall some discussion of this a
while back on the LKML.
athlon 850 (200 FSB)
512 MB RAM
IWILL KK266

----------------------------
I just upgradede my system to an 1200Mhz AMD Athlon Thundirbird (266Mhz
FSB) processor / 512Meg of RAM, and an
Asus kt7a motherboard. 
It is oppsing left and right. I recompiled the kernel with Athelon as
the CPU but keep getting these oopses.. 
I also get these same problems while trying to install RH 7.1 
Anyone know is this a supported processor / MB and has anyone had these
problems? 
Joe please cc me as I am not on this list.
