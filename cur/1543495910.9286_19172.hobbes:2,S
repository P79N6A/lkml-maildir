I suppose you intend to turn normal user abilities into default
capabilities. (the ability to write to a writable file...)
I think that has the same problem, but nevermind.
It is also dangerous to add default capabilities because apps may drop
unknown capabilities, causing failure at some critical point.

When the interpreter and script both have capabilities marked...?

You give capabilities to your trusted interpreter.
It handles the issue according to whatever policy is needed.

You only get stuck with the existance of the mechanism, which isn't
too bad. The mechanism may be needed anyway for non-native filesystems.
Nothing prevents the creation of an alternate system that overrides the
ELF header. (so there is no need to even look at the ELF notes in that case)
