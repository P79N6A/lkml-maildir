Hmm, I am not sure what the specs of AHCI are.  Not sure if it supports
2 or 4 or more ports.  The only controllers I have seen that run more
than 4 ports, are some raid cards, such as 3ware and areca.  3ware has
had linux support for years, and areca is getting there.  Both of those
make 12+ port cards, which can run in JBOD mode.
