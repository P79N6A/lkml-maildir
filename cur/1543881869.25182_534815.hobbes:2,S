Yes.  I noticed this was happening a few days ago.
I must not have mentioned it loudly enough.

Yep.  We don't continue to use the early page table pages if you
enable PAE, but otherwise we do.
Which also gives us potential permission issues with the initial page
tables.

Yes our initial page table setup on arch/i386 is full of issues.
I'm halfway through putting together a patchset to address a
bunch of these.
I haven't yet resolved how I want to allocate the pages for the
identity mapping of the page table yet.  I can't use the bootmem
allocate as it exists because that assumes the page is mapped
into the address space already.
