I'm  using the VIA audio driver and I have what appears to be a very similar
problem:
When I try to move my XMMS window while playing a song the window sometimes
"gets stuck" for a second or so during the move. Moving the window without
any song playing works just fine. I also tried setting the buffer to 200ms
but it didn't solve it for me either.
dmesg reports:
Via 686a audio driver 1.1.14b
PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:07.5
via82cxxx: Codec rate locked at 48Khz
