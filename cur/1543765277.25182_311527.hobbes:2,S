Failure to have a click-through license means that there is no acceptance, 
which is a fundamental part of contract law.  No acceptance, no contract, no 
exceptions.  So yes, the difference in many of the click through license 
cases is whether the contract was something you couldn't avoid accepting.
There is talk these days among tech contract drafters to develop a more 
universal method for electronic acceptance...  probably something that will 
be written into the Uniform Commercial Code in the next few decades (behold, 
the speed of legal evolution!).
