hi,
	is there any need we maintain wait queues as circular lists ?
the only reason I can think of is that we might have to remove an 
element without knowing which list it belongs to. but __remove_wait_queue
is passed the address of the list head and just ignores it, going the full
circle every time. seems to me that it might be slightly faster, on the 
average, to use good old linear null-terminated lists. plus we would
avoid the hairiness of WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD.
