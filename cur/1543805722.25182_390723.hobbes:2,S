Right.
I'm working on it.
Somehow it was lodged in my mind that a task_struct cannot represent
a process group, but it can obviously be the first in a link list.
Because of that I so far I have been approaching the weak reference
problem from the pid hash table side.  While using pid hash tables
can come out fairly clean, my best solution so far doubled the size
of the pid hash table.
I have two things that still concern me.
- The size of the linked list in pathological cases.
- Consistently picking a leader for a process group.
But I don't know if either one of them will actually be a problem,
so I think I will walk down that implementation path and see where
it takes me.
