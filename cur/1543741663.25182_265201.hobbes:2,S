Interestingly, the debug printks are not showing up in
acpi_bus_register_driver() before the oops, and they should be if that's
where it's happening.  Compiling with debug info makes the oops go away.
Here's some debugging of the last few drivers to be registered before the 
oops is seen:
name=hpet node=c03ee9a0 acpi_bus_drivers.prev=c03ea6a0
name=i8042 node=c03eeda0 acpi_bus_drivers.prev=c03ee9a0
name=floppy node=c03f24c0 acpi_bus_drivers.prev=c03ee9a0
Note acpi_bus_drivers.prev for floppy was not set to c03eeda0, which you 
would normally expect?
