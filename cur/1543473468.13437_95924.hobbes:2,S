Hello-
I've had close to zero luck getting my Samsung VG34323A drive to work in
ultra DMA mode.  The kernel reports checksum errors and halts during
boot with DMA enabled.  Disabling DMA on the drive in the kernel
configuration lets me use it, but of course I'd like to figure out what
is causing the problem.  If I remember correctly I had to disable it in
Win95 also. 
Here's my setup:
motherboard is FIC VA-503+ (Award BIOS), Pentium MMX 233, onboard IDE
controller.
there is a Samsung 32x cdrom on the same ide cable, between the
controller and the drive.
If anyone has had success getting UDMA with a similar setup, or has any
suggestions please let me know.  Thanks in advance.
