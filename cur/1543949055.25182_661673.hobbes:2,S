Why make it more complex? If we're going for a solution that involves
an implicit partition of the namespace that the user has to be aware
of, then simple is good.

Of course - I don't think anyone's suggesting that the kernel can do
anything about two competing users fighting over who gets to create
cgroup "Foo". But IMO it's crazy to have multiple uncoordinated
userspace cgroup managers.

That was one of the questions that I left open - we could add it
defaulting to off, unless a mount option was given.

Correct.

Yes, but compared to all the other configuration details that a
userspace cgroup manager needs to work with, I think this would be a
minor one.

The main reason it's not my primary choice is that it's an implicit
rule that the user has to know about or risk getting bitten in future.
Making that rule complex is even worse, I think.
Of course it does have the big advantage that no code changes are
needed, just documentation. So if people prefer it, then I'm not going
to fight hard.
