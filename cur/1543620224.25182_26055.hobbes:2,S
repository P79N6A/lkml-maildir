This is not possible, since then %gs:0 (which is TLS base) cannot be read.
We would have to change the TLS ABI (thus become incompatible e.g. with Sun)
- note that these sequences are emitted by compiler or linker (the latter in
code transformations) and pick some hardcoded constant, say %gs:0x1000.
This would mean though that every single non-threaded app would need to
mmap a page at 4KB. If this offset was not constant, it would slow down all
TLS accesses.

Like above, a fixed address for mmap would have to be chosen, but the
advantage would be that the TLS ABI would need no changing.
Simply kernel would add 0x33 to GDT as 4KB -> 0xc0000000 user data segment
and apps could put that value into %gs if not using threads.
But I think there is c) and d).
c) is just minor modification of current ldt handling in kernel, which would
   mean a single entry LDT (residing in task_struct) could be used instead
   of vmalloced one - this has the disadvantage of lldt on almost every
   context switch
d) default to a single-entry per-cpu LDT, which only non-linux personality
   apps and apps needing more than 1 LDT entry (threaded apps, wine/dosemu/...)
   would not use. Non-linux apps would use current default_ldt and those
   needing more than one LDT would use the current vmalloced mm private area.
   If a task would be using this per-cpu LDT (common case), context switch
   would do lldt only if previous task was not using the per-cpu LDT
   (unlikely) and just store task_struct->thread.ldt_word_0 and ldt_word_1
   into the per-cpu LDT (dunno how expensive is that, but IMHO it should be
   cheaper than full load_LDT).
