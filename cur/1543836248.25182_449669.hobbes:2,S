Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] Relative lazy atime
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/3/27

My friend Akkana followed my advice to use noatime on one of her
machines, but discovered that mutt was unusable because it always
thought that new messages had arrived since the last time it had
checked a folder (mbox format).  I thought this was a bummer, so I
wrote a "relative lazy atime" patch which only updates the atime if
the old atime was less than the ctime or mtime.  This is not the same
as the lazy atime patch of yore[1], which maintained a list of inodes
with dirty atimes and wrote them out on unmount.
Patch below.  Current version (plus test program) is at:
http://infohost.nmt.edu/~val/patches.html#lazyatime
Thanks to everyone who discussed this with me, especially the folks on
#linuxfs on irc.oftc.net.

Relative lazy atime - only update atime if the old atime was older
than the ctime or mtime.  We are maintaining atime relative to
mtime/ctime.
Not for inclusion (yet).
