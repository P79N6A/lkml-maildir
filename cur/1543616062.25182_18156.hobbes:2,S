I only got this extra bit of infomation from the way you said for me to do it.
When i loaded usbcore this time it said cant get major 180 for usb....
Ok i loaded it as you said it all went find but it never gave me anything 
when i went to do "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices".
Also this is the most information i can get when it is initialzing the usb 
device(insmod usb-storage):
Using /lib/modules/2.4.17/kernel/drivers/usb/storage/usb-storage.o
usb.c: registered new driver usb-storage
scsi0: SCSI Emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
usb-uhci.c: ENXIO 800000200, flags 0,urb ccaeb440, burb ccaeb4c0
usb-uhci.c: interrupt, status 3, frame #1758
usb.c USB disconnect on device 2
hub.c USB new device connect on bus3/2, assigned device number 3
Manufactuar: ScanLogic USBIDE
Product: ScanLogic USBIDE
usb-storage:host_reset() requested but not implemented
scsi: device set offline - command error recover failed; host0 channel 0 id 
0 lun 0
i had to write this out i hope its perfect to what it said
Regards,
Dylan
