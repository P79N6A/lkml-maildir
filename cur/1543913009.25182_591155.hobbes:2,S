OK, the problem was crappy 4.1.1 gcc on my side (that has been a known bug 
and already fixed in later update). Updated patch below, thanks for your 
suggestions Franck.

i386 and x86_64: randomize brk()
This patch randomizes the location of the heap (brk) for i386 and x86_64. 
The range is randomized in the range starting at current brk location up 
to 0x02000000 offset for both architectures. This, together with 
pie-executable-randomization.patch and 
pie-executable-randomization-fix.patch, should make the address space 
randomization on i386 and x86_64 complete.
