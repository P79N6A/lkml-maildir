That's fine for a desktop box, but I wouldn't really want a heavily
loaded server to have database queries starved just because somebody
is scrolling through a log file, or moving windows about doing admin
work.
The wordprocessor example is an interesting one - if the user is
changing fonts, re-flowing text and generally using it like a DTP
application, then I'd agree that it needs to have a more CPU.
If I was simply typing a letter, I wouldn't really care about
interactivity.  If I was using a heavily loaded server to do it,
(unlikely), I'd rather the wordprocessor was starved, and updated the
screen once per second, and gave more time to the server processes,
because I don't need the visual feedback to carry on typing.  Screen
updates are a waste of CPU in that instance - it might look nice, but
all it's doing is starving the CPU even more.
I propose a radically different approach to scheduling, why not
favour processes that cause the fewest cache faults?  I.E. if a
process that gets more done in it's timeslice is more deserving of
it.  It might look ugly with screen updates being starved, but it
would probably get more work done :-).
John.
