Yes...
It is possible to take read_lock(&tasklist_lock) before:
        inc_preempt_count();
        curval = futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(uaddr, uval, newval);
        dec_preempt_count();
and drop it after lookup_pi_state().
In this case exiting task will set FUTEX_OWNER_DIED, but will
spin in exit_notify(), we will find valid pi_state and go slow path
taking rtmutex.
