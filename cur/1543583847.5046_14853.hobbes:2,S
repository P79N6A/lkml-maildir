Well, I personally don't see what would be a problem... Of course, the 
current i386 irq.c cannot be re-used completel "as is". The bit of code
that gets the actual irq number has to be arch specific. But most of the
locking issues are completely platform neutral.
I personally see that code as a good framework that provides many features
that may or may not be neccessary depending on the level of brokenness of
a given interrupt controller.

We lost stability ? Hrm... If we had ever a problem with SMP, it was in the
openpic code, and apparently, due to a HW bug. I don't think the new irq.c
code in itself caused us to lose stability. I actually do think it improved
the locking, and so, stability.

Well, we have been running this new irq.c which I partially based on
i386 for some monthes now, and had enough time to iron out most problems.
Again, all the stability problems we had so far were related to the openpic
implementation, I don't remember seeing one stability problem reported so
far that was related to irq.c. And I've been running a couple of dual
G4s without much trouble for some time now. 
We do (did ?) have a problem with irq distribution on SMP with openpic. I'm
not sure we yet know exactly why, according to both you and IBM people, we
are running over an HW bug of the openpic core. I see nothing in irq.c
that can cause this.
On the other hand, the new irq.c brings the irq depth handling, the ability
to call enable/disable from within the handler (I've been wanting that for
some time for the PMU driver), proper spinlock'ing, etc...
And last, but not least, consistent semantics of enable/disable irq
exposed to drivers (especially things like disable_irq() actually waiting
for that irq to be completed on any other CPU).
