It might. I be happy to share what I know about i860/i960 over pizza.
I worked on ATT SVR4 port to i860 in 1989/90 and things were quite
different then...

I'm not so interested in "right" or "wrong". I'd just like to see other
arches besides x86 work well (ia64, parisc in particular) and that includes
how linux deals with unaligned accesses. If x86 is the gold standard
for "the right way", we'd be using bounce buffers for DMA to highmem
(well, PAE support would get added somehow) and 64-bit kernels wouldn't
have happened...but linux so far seems to accomodate other arches *when
reasonable*.  I'll follow Andrew Morton's comments...

Yes, true.  But I think we are digressing from the original thread here...
(/me works his way around another really big rat hole :^)
