Really? I'd say it depends on where you are.
Turning the attention back to network resources:
At least it's polite to ask first, but  in many parts of the world it is
mandatory or you may be committing a crime.
BTW: If you'd  use resources of one of our  medical equipment (of course
our network  is firewalled, but  we are talking internal  network here),
just  because their  crappy  software comes  with  all network  services
enabled, only  the support  tech is  allowed to change  this and  he has
absolutely no idea what the network  admin is talking about (I have seen
a mri scanner going wild after a simple snmp status probe from a network
management station and the support  tech wouldn't allow turning the SNMP
daemon off!)  and some people  suffer injuries or  even die as  a result
of you action then i really wouldn't want to be you!
Yours,
