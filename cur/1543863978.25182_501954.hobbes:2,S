Well, FWIW, some years ago we (I was working for the Norwegian
regulatory body at the time) tried to host an ETSI working group
meeting in Longyearbyen ( 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen
 ).
Despite this actually being in Europe, there were quite a few
complaints. Some of the regular participants had problems with the
additional travelling expenses, but the most common complaint was the
wast of time.  And that was nowhere near an intercontinental flight...
We ended up having the meeting in Oslo, as usual.
