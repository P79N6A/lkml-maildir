Thanks, I will try to do so.

But it is none, definitely not. There are also system hangups without that stupid reinitialization of the burning device. No idea where the reason for that may stay, but I swear I am gonna do my best to find out.

It is not busy at all, but it happens.

Great! I am gonna revert this one and keep on testing. But it takes time and the machine must run several hours. If it is not IDE related then it may be time related. Anyway that is the most crucial bug I have ever tried to trace. More evil like a virus!
