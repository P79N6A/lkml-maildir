Mostly agreed. Except:
a) the glibc version is not actually all that optimized
b) it's nice that it's not recursive
c) the three-way median selection does help avoid worst-case O(n^2)
behavior, which might potentially be triggerable by users in places
like XFS where this is used
I'll probably whip up a simpler version tomorrow or Monday and do some
size/space benchmarking. I've been meaning to contribute a qsort for
doubly-linked lists I've got lying around as well.
