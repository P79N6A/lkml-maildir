It's exactly helper. It helps to expand functionality of a main
processor.

I do not know any chip that would be "just add a CPU and you'll get
a complete system", do you?

If you used ASIC acronym it would be more appropriate and not so
ambiguous.
What kind of chips you deal with does not fit ASIC acronym?

"peripheral/integrated controllers" are also within companion chips.
Every type of CMOS devices may be a part of processor chip or
may be a standalone chip as well as a group of CMOS devices
may be a part of the proc chip or may organize a standalone chip.
When your chip is missing a processor device then it is not
a system but a part of a system, you can not build a complete
system on a such chip, so you can not call it a "system-on-chip".
