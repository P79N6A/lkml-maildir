yes.  the number of probed devices is variable.
note that, as seen above, there are two cases: with a card id and
without a card id.  in the latter case, the card id is not checked but
only the given device id is checked, while the former case will need
checks all ids.

it looks fine to me.

...hmm, i don't see the card id on sysfs.
i think it's not implemented yet!
Adam, any plan to give the card id to sysfs ?

@ is a valid latter as the ISA pnp id string.  it's not a wildcard.
(that's one of the reasons i showed it :)
the id consists of three letters [A-Z@] and four hex numbers
[0-9a-f].
one exception is 'XXXX' used as numbers, which means that any numbers
match.  for example, CTLXXXX matches CTL0305, CTLa12f, etc.
ciao,
Takashi
