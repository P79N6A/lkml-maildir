I gotta say, I'm a little lost as to why you're taking this upon yourself,
considering that Zwane is for all intents and purposes the maintainer now
instead of me, and he seems to be effectively pushing stuff into 2.5 via
the Alan -> Marcelo -> Dave Jones -> Linus scheme.  I would really prefer
that you let him submit a patch for this, as I'm pretty sure that the
addition of the isapnp_change_resource calls will break the driver for
anyone whose machine doesn't have DMA 0 available.
