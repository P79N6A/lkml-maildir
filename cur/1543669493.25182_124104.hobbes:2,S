Not yet.
I have posted a patch enabling this a couple of times, but it has not
mainstream kernel yet :-(
There is people that request this feature, and it is doable - with some
annoying restrictions. The main issue is that the kernel src shall be
free of generated files when compiling for a separate objtree.
I got limited feedback on the implementataion so far.
The patch will most likely be updated during easter.
