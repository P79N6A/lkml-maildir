I began seeing this very thing around 2.6.24 time.  (Fedora 8, vanilla 
kernel.)  I could usually cause the gnome terminal to hang if I rapidly 
resized the window while executing make check-headers.
Over a couple of days I bisected it down to this commit:

     hrtimer: unlock hrtimer_wakeup
     hrtimer_wakeup creates a
       base->lock
         rq->lock
     lock dependancy. Avoid this by switching to 
HRTIMER_CB_IRQSAFE_NO_SOFTIRQ
     which doesn't hold base->lock.
     This fully untangles hrtimer locks from the scheduler locks, and allows
     hrtimer usage in the scheduler proper.

Reverting the commit seemed to fix the problem for me.
Then I went away on a business trip Monday morning and returned Tuesday 
night to a dead computer (won't POST), so I can't do any further 
troubleshooting until I get it fixed.
Try reverting that patch and see if your gnome-terminal freezes go away.
