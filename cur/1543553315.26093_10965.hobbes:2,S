Then I think it will be up to you to achieve the non gcc build or to teach
your compiler gcc extensions (which may or may not be easier). The kernel also
tends to know a few things about how gcc optimises code which shouldn't matter
if your compiler is good enough to optimise nicely anyway.
AFAIK the only non gcc port of Linux isnt exactly a port but was ELKS done using
bcc86 (Bruce Evans compiler)
