But the "user-reclaimable" areas can still be taken over by other
areas which become fragmented.
That's like saying we can already guarantee 100% success in removing
areas that are unfragmented and free, or freeable.

I don't like all this work and complexity and overheads going into a
partial solution.
Look: if you have to guarantee memory can be shrunk, set aside a zone
for it (that only fills with user reclaimable areas). This is better
than the current frag patches because it will give you the 100%
guarantee that you need (provided we have page migration to move mlocked
pages).
If you don't need a guarantee, then our current, simple system does the
job perfectly.

I would more like to see something like this happen (provided it was
nicely abstracted away and could be CONFIGed out for the 99.999% of
users who don't need the overhead or complexity).
