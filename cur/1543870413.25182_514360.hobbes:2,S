I reported this a while ago and suggested to have the number of 
pending accepts reported with the event to save that last syscall.
I  created an ab replacement based on kevent, and at least with my 
machines, which are comparable to each other, the load on client 
dropped from 100% to 2% or something. ab just doesn't give meaningful 
results  (if the client is not way more powerful). With that new client 
I get very similar results for epoll and kevent, from 1000 through to 
26000 concurrent requests, the results have been posted on 
kevent-homepage in october, I just checked it with new version, but 
there's no significant difference.
this is the benchmark with kevent-based client:

btw, each result is average over 1,000,000 requests
and just for comparison, this is on the same machines using ab:
