I misread cinergyt2_release, it checks !->disconnect_pending, so it is
very clear why cinergyt2_query_rc() tries to take the mutex.

I don't think we can just kill flush_scheduled_work(). We can use
cancel_rearming_delayed_work() instead of
cancel_delayed_work()+flush_scheduled_work()
Still we can't do this under cinergyt2->sem, because cinergyt2_query()
takes it too. This all looks very wrong to me, I hope maintaners can
explain.
I think cinergyt2_query() and cinergyt2_query_rc() should not use
->disconnect_pending at all. cinergyt2_disconnect() should set
->disconnect_pending = 1 and cancel both delayed_works.
cinergyt2_release() checks !->disconnect_pending and does the cancel
without mutex.
Oleg.
