Great! So the Evil Bastard can only eat up 60Mb of RAM (/tmp, /var, /home
have pieces that are writable to a user). He just needs a buddy to kill
this machine (128Mb RAM) very much dead then. Now I can sleep well. Or
perhaps have half a dozen users doing nothing in particular, and the
machine is OOM.
20Mb RAM for a filesystem per user is _ridiculous_, AFAIAC. Most users
around here have much less for a quota!
