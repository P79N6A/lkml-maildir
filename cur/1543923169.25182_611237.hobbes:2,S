If you need to unbind usbhid driver from the device and bind another one, 
you can use the 'unbind' and 'bind' files in sysfs.
As soon as the driver you are willing to test is bound to the device, you 
can go ahead with testing any functionality you wish (probably 
suspend/resume cycle is needed here?).
If the device is claimed by usbhid driver (because its descriptor probably 
states that it's HID-compliant device) and should be claimed by another 
driver, it's necessary to add it to usbhid blacklist -- just let me know.
