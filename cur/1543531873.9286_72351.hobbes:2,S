And I arrived later too. But while we're on the subject of swap space,
doesn't "reserve me 8MB of disk-based swap as backing for my stack" cure
everyones OOM blues? I propose that that's a fair use for swap nowadays.
I don't _actually_ want to use swap myself, and having it there only
as the "gold-standard" at the back of the IOU seems the best use.
That only leaves malloc and fork overhead as candidates for unexpected 
segfaults. Malloc can be cured by the programmer touching the memory
when he gets it. Fork overhead is dealt with by having a reserve for
the kernel.
