I disagree.  The comment (your very own, I think?) and the code made
sense to me.  It's saying this is rather unusual, but safe against
preemption, because keventd is per-cpu (it might perhaps be better
if it said each keventd is bound to a cpu).
The code works in such a way that if it is a keventd, then it'll
correctly arrive at the answer yes; and if it's not a keventd,
then even if it's preempted to a different cpu in the middle,
the test won't match any keventd and so it'll correctly arrive
at the answer no.
But I'm content with the half-liner already there.

Yes, that's true, raw_smp_processor_id() is needed to avoid the
warning; but it was already preempt-safe with smp_processor_id(),
just in danger of giving an inappropriate warning.
