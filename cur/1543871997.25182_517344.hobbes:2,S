Hmm.  Either I am confused of I just found an unanticipated leak.
pci_restore_msi_state should be out of the picture as we don't yet
have ppc msi support and I don't think the g5 generation hardware
supported it either.
The only case I can see which might trigger this is if we saved
pci-X state and then didn't restore it because we could not find
the capability on restore.
Any chance you could walk that list and find the cap_nr of the remaining
element?  
Something like:
{
	struct pci_cap_saved_state *tmp;
	struct hlist_node *pos;
	hlist_for_each_entry(tmp, pos, &pci_dev->saved_cap_space, next)
        	printk(KERN_INFO "saved_cap: 0x%02x\n", tmp->cap_nr);
}
Until I get the best scenario I can come up with is a tg3 hardware bug
that doesn't renable the pci-X capability after a restore of power state.
Getting that cap_nr will at least allow me to be certain if I am dealing
with msi, pci-X or pci-e.
Unanticipated bugs aren't supposed to be this easy to find!
