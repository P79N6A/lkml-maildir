If you mean the "GFP_BUFFER allocations should fail instead
of looping forever" thing, it is because:
1) GFP_BUFFER allocations are made in order to try to flush
   (and free) pages and allocate highmem pages.
2) This is the page flushing equivalent of PF_MEMALLOC, in
   the sense that we should not go and try to "recursively"
   flush more random pages until we find one that succeeds
   without an allocation; instead, we should just break the
   loop and let the caller deal with it.
If you mean the change to nr_free_buffer_pages(), that one
is needed because that function should return what the name
implies ... returning "2 GB of memory available for dirty
buffers" makes for a completely filled up ZONE_NORMAL and
processes which never get throttled for writing (and instead,
end up looping for more memory and killing performance for
the rest of the system).
regards,
Rik
