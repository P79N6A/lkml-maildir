Nope.
I've written such software for floppies (way back when an Apple ][+ was a  
nice computer), and what I'd expect is half a rotation plus a little bit  
more. (Incidentally, that floppy driver already had ballistic head  
movement.)
Because that's how it works: scan the track until you know the next sector  
is the one you want, wait for the current sector to end (or the header of  
the next sector to occur, depending on what's actually written on the  
platter), then start writing.
You don't usually go looking for a different point on the track first.  
That's just a waste. (And that's why index holes are a bad idea.)
