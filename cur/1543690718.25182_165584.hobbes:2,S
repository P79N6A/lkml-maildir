Different people have different needs:
Sometimes you want kernels booting everywhere, e.g. a distribution might
want to support all CPUs from an 386 to an Opteron with one kernel for
their boot floppies.
For a system administrator with only Pentium 3 and Pentum 4 machines
support for 386 and Opteron isn't of much worth.
In some embedded systems people are happy about every kB their kernel is 
smaller.
