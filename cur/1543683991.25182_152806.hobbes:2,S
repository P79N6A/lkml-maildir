It'd be really helpful to have something like sysfs support for 
workqueues. I haven't seen it anywhere though. Did I miss it? Is anyone 
already working on it? I'll work on it if no one else is already. At 
least it'd help enough that I'm willing to give it a try. Any major 
problems anyone can foresee?
