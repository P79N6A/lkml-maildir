Funny, other people seem to be using it.

That this patch has not yet been merged is crippling your development
efforts HOW, exactly?  I was clearly mistaken when I thought that this
was low priority.

This is true.  It doesn't need to for 0.7, but it's being reintroduced
in 0.8 for speed.

Yes, this is a bug (and one not reported by anyone, either).  Should
be fixed in 0.8.

Really?  I don't recall seeing a bug report from you about it.  My
Debian system boots fine.

Um, we always had a flat module namespace.  *ALWAYS*.  We did put the
modules into subdirectories though.  Due to Adam Richter's hard work,
with 0.8 we can restore this (basically for the benifit of mkinitrd,
which I also don't use).

Really?  How fascinating.  I must admit that I hadn't noticed that.
Rusty.
