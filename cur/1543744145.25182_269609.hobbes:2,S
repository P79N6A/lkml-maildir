There are a number of problems with this, for example modern libcs
built with -fomit-frame-pointer limit it's usefulness.  But when it
does get meaningful traces it's really quite useful.

The code reads:
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
        if (!spin_trylock(&current->mm->page_table_lock))
                return;
#endif
i.e. it tries to get the lock and abandons the trace if it can't.
