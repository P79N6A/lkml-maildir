Subject: [PATCH] Fix up mmap_kmem

vma->vm_pgoff is an pfn _offset_ relatif to the begining
of the memory start. The previous code was doing at first:
	vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT
which results into a wrong physical address since some
platforms have a physical mem start that can be different
from 0. After that the previous call __pa() on this
wrong physical address, however __pa() is used to convert
a _virtual_ address into a physical one.
This patch rewrites this convertion. It calculates the
pfn of PAGE_OFFSET which is the pfn of the mem start
then it adds the vma->vm_pgoff to it.
It also uses virt_to_phys() instead of __pa() since the
latter shouldn't be used by drivers.
