Aha, perhaps you're the one we've been waiting for.  I've suspected
a DRM issue, but nobody has actually seen one until now, and I didn't
want to put in a patch without live justification.
Would you please try the patch below, and let us know if it fixes your
problem.  If so, I'll send it off to Andrew and Linus: the rest of the
PageReserved fixes, including the sound driver Bad page state fixes,
have gone into Linus' git tree today: perhaps this is the missing piece.
If this does not work for you, then presumably you'd be another sound
driver sufferer?  and I should send you that patch (or you pick it up
from yesterday's LKML).  But right now I'd selfishly like you to test
just this DRM patch below.
Thanks,
Hugh
