I have definitely experienced this exact same issue as well ever since
going into 2.4.25. I've tried the patches for 2.4.26 up to and including
2.4.26-pre4 as well and they don't make a difference.
It is interesting to note that this happens with every single machine
running RedHat 7.3 with its default (official) mount version 2.11n.
Apparently as you stated, upgrading mount to a newer version gets rid of
the "error messages". Reverting back to 2.4.24 also clears the problem.
I have been able to confirm that this is happening consistently
regardless of the hardware being used.

Well I have RedHat 7.3, and when I saw the second message I have updated
mount from 2.11n (it's the official/updated RedHat 7.3 version) to 2.12.
The "error" messages are gone. but I do not really know if the error is 
gone.
