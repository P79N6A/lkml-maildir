Well that doesn't mean that the practice makes much sense.
Security (which is probably too strong a word for these relatively
weak DoS anyways; it's not like anybody's data gets leaked like
Alan hinted at with his bogus analogy) is only useful if it's perfect; if it 
has holes that cannot be plugged it is just wasted effort and likely 
harming other good causes (like bug free software)

You might not know applications are segfaulting. e.g. when I originally
enabled it we found that a few obscure cases in a default system
were occasionally segfaulting, but nobody noticed because there
wasn't a really visible malfunction. Still fixing those made
a better system.

One standard way is to overflow the socket limits or the TCP memory allocation 
for example. Or just run the system out of memory; that will get plenty of logs
(don't say ulimit now, you know as well as me that they are not good enough
to prevent oom from users). Or use an unaligned a.out executable.
That was just from a quick look, I'm sure there are more.
Some of these are rate limited, but rate limiting just means it will take longer
to fill the disk. 
There are also a couple (rate limited ones) that can be triggered from the network.
Anyways if you feel strongly about it then rate limit the x86-64 ones
(Masoud's patch did this anyways); but please don't turn them off.
