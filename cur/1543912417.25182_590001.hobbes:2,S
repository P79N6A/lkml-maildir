Indeed.  I didn't intend to include this hunk because I hadn't tested
it -- I've not seen a task get stuck there.  In trying to fix it, I
noticed that the sync_page_killable() is inadequate -- it'll return -EIO
for any signal, not just a fatal one.  Sure, other signals won't wake
it, but if they're pending, it'll do the wrong thing.  Fixed patch
coming up ... just as soon as I find out what other bug I've introduced.
