Common case is O(1) of course, but "average" it's a mean between "worst"
and "best/common". I'm not missing anything about the global flush
either.
It _enterely_ depends on the timings.
If the global flush takes 1 hour, and the O(N) pass takes 1usec, you'd
better increase N.
If the O(N) pass takes 1 hour, and the flush takes 1usec, you'd better
drecrease N.
This is always been clear, it's just that I _didn't_ know the exact
timings of your hardware before this thread, so I couldn't calculate
with math what was the best balance between the two (plus there's also
the fact of the process sleeping and the page->virtual cache size that
changes as well and that are other variables that you overlooked in your
below equation, that are non nearly not possible to evaluate with an
exact math formula as well).
2048 looked a fair enough balance, 8M of mapped cache, not an excessive
virtual space wasted, and not too high frequency of the flushes (that
probably are very costly on a 16way). Thanks to Hugh's hold-counter now
the kmaps can also be shared across the higher user. so the 8m of cache
are used at best for both pagecache and pagetables.

Quite a lot yes. Furthmore the global tlb flush is slow and it has to be
run atomically to avoid people to start using entries still cached in
the tlb with corrupted values. so it doesn't matter much the size of the
pool, the flush_pkmap pass still is slow due the global flush and the
other cpus stalls into the lock.

I outlined a possible way to do that too in the previous email, not sure
if there are possibility to make it completly scalar per-cpu, I hope so
because the pinning of the task doesn't look very appealing from a
scheduler standpoint.
