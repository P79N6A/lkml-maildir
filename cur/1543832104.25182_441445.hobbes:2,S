Hi,
this has nothing to do with the development model. The userspace syscall
ABI *has* to be stable. If we make a mistake that's a high price but we
pay it. This fwiw is one of the reasons we are/should be very careful
with adding system calls, and make sure the behavior is indeed right.
It's also the reason we're not so happy about new ioctls; they're
effectively mini-system calls with the same ABI issues, but just less
controlled/reviewed/designed/visible.
Greetings,
