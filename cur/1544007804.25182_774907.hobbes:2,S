I wonder why nobody of vmscan folks write actual performance improvement value
in patch description.
I think this patch point to right direction.
but, unfortunately, this implementation isn't fast as I mesured as.

On large machine, DEF_PRIORITY / 2 is really catastrophe situation.
2^6 = 64. 
if zone has 64GB memory, it mean 1GB reclaim.
I think more early restriction is better.

if you want to restrict to one task, you can use mutex.
and this wait_queue should put on global variable. it should be zone variable.
In addision, you don't consider recursive relaim and several task can't sleep there.
please believe me. I have richest experience about reclaim throttling in the planet.
