Since patch dj2 I moved things a little, sorry about this, it was
announced in the second patch announcement..
I wouldn't have cc'd this back to the list, but a few people asked about
patch dj1 moving so this seemed to make more sense..
Any changes in 2.2.2ac7dj2 that need porting to 2.2.3 will happen over the
next few days. In particular, the PCI Bridge optimisation will be cut,
and moved to userspace. (I've heard no cries of Nooooo!! yet..)
regards,
d.
