Picking up on this specific point...
It may be worth discussing this issue a little more and finding out
whether Marcelo would be willing to take it (maybe for .22 or .23?)
It has been in the 2.4-ac trees for some time without much problem,
and it can be configured out.
The only real sting in the tale is that it won't have the sysfs
interfaces, because there's probably no way in hell that sysfs would
appear in 2.4.  Since it is in 2.4-ac, this problem has already been
solved.
Personally, I'd like to see cpufreq go into 2.4 since its a requirement
for some ARM platforms.
