Old-fashioned man pages are written in *roff.
For example,
.TH example 0 2001-09-14 "" ""
.SH NAME
example \- how to write a man page
.SH SYNOPSIS
how to invoke
.SH DESCRIPTION
what it does
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
what it returns
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
standards
.SH NOTES
interesting tidbits
.SH "SEE ALSO"
related stuff
In man(7) you can read about the macros used.
The easiest way to start is to copy some other man page.
These days it is frowned upon if you really use detailed knowledge
of *roff. Man pages are produced by conversion from other formats,
and conversely other formats are produced by conversion from *roff
(e.g., by man2html). Knowing more about *roff than what is documented
in man(7) may be bad for you - these automatic converters have only
a limited knowledge.
