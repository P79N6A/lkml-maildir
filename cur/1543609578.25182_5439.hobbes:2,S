There's a difference between telling you what to think, and trying to
point out why your methods are flawed.  I also would never presume to
tell anyone what to think or do; I am trying to emphasize here that your
choice makes it difficult to review the code, and affects the long-term
maintainability of the codebase overall.  It wouldn't really be an issue
if the code weren't so far from CodingStyle that everyone else is used
to.
Is a compromise possible?  Can you keep a local codebase in your own
coding style, and then run Lindent before sending to Linus?
Ideally in 2.5 devfs (or some form thereof) is gonna be the centerpiece
of our new and wonderful dynamic device world.  It would be nice if that
was what the majority consider readable code...
