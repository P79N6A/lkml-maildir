Hi
I tried 2.5.68-mm1 last night and found that after one suspend/resume cycle the
3c574_cs PCMCIA ethernet card didn't work. The only weirdness in the logs is
Apr 21 17:57:47 flat kernel: eth0: command 0x5800 did not complete!
Apr 21 17:58:18 flat last message repeated 1376 times
which appeared after resuming. Once the card was ejected/reinserted the card
worked fine.
After that the machine would not go into suspend state. 2.5.66-mm3 worked fine.
Didn't try suspend in 2.5.67-mm4.
On the plus side, the 3c574_cs driver fixes seem to work.
