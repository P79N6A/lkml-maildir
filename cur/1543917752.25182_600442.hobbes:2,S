how does it behave without the cfs patch applied? Does it work better 
under v20.5? The best debug output for me to look at would be to 
download these two scripts:
 
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
 
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info-clear.sh
first run cfs-debug-info-clear.sh, then use the system for a few minutes 
and make sure apps are behaving in a 'stutter-free' way. Then run 
cfs-debug-info.sh (still no glxgears running) - it will produce a "no 
load" debug info file. Then start the 9x glxgears instances, reproduce 
the "stuttering" behavior in the apps, and run cfs-debug-info.sh - this 
will produce a second "under load" output file. Please send me both 
output files.
also, what's the output of "glxgears -info" - does it render on real 3D 
hardware, or uses the sw-mesa fallback?
