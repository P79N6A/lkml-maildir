oh cool, thanks.  This saves me some work.  I originally did a lot of
the cleanup in 2.4 to get rid of malloc.h references, but specifically
didn't touch much arch/* at the time.
tangent, it would be nice to remove __KERNEL__ from at least the i386
kernel headers in 2.5, and I think it's a doable task...
