When is it (should it) going to offline the drive? its been spitting
out these messages (about set per min?) for 4 hours at the moment with
no change bar the sector number increasing by 2 each time...

Done. The new short cable showed no difference in behavior.
So left with the timing/setup error... Anyone with any ideas?

as I said before there are two hardisks

(Remember the problem is ONLY with the second drive... and according
to others any in the 6Vxxx series shows this same issue?)
  ...and there is a cdrom drive attached via pata
(I think its on the same controller... the 6300ESB seems to do just
about everything...)
hdparm -I /dev/hda

As Ian mentioned maxtor have release a new version of the drive
firmware ... but... The 6V250F0 drive that shows this lockup IS
running the latest drive firmware  which I discovered after a rather
long exchange with Maxtor...
I have had a bit of a look at the sata spec and would just like to
confirm that the drive is configured to disable the NCQ (as the Maxtor
support seemed to stress this point). From what i can see this is done
in the Device Configuration Overlay...
From the spec
  4.8. Device Configuration Overlay
    4.8.1. Definition
WORD 8: Serial ATA command / feature sets supported
       This word enables configuration of command sets and feature sets.
       Bit 0 indicates whether native command queuing shall be
supported by the device. When
       set to one, the drive shall support native command queuing.
When cleared to zero, drive
       support for native command queuing shall be disabled ....
So anyone got any ideas how to read this?
Or anything else to check / try...
Samuel
