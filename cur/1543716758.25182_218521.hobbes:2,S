 Not even that -- the exact calculation leading to the base address
reported is:
ioremap_nocache(0x100b0000) - ioremap(0xdc000000) + (0x1f0 << 5)
and is really a workaround for no better way of expressing an address of
an MMIO IDE interface (0xdc000000 is the base address of the PCI I/O
space, unswapped).  I see no reason to use virtual addresses for report 
here.

 Well, I suppose they have simply swapped bytes at the connector. ;-)  
This is a guess, though, as I lack docs in this area.  The important bit
is the endiannes of the generic bus used here never changes.
