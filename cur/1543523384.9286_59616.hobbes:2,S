Linux doesn't do what Sun (or BSD) does for MS_INVALIDATE.
The reason Sun does what it does is for consistency reasons - they have
inconsistent caches with various problems, which means that MS_INVALIDATE
historically is used as a software cache consistency thing. 
Linux doesn't have inconsistent caches, so..
The only way to get reasonable benchmark numbers is to have a benchmark
that has a big enough working set that it doesn't fail over caching. The
same way "dhrystone" is not a good benchmark on modern chips, obviously
this is not a good benchmark on modern operating systems.
