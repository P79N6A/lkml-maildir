The latter:  device_may_wakeup() never returns true.  There are three paths
for that:
  (a) userspace workaround, which is the regression that was reported;
  (b) the AMD 756 workaround, and
  (c) that board-specific quirk code.
Of course (c) hasn't been submitted yet because it didn't work ... evidently
because of the regression where device_may_wakeup(root_hub) was ignored.

Well, there are at least two regressions then.  One is the one in $SUBJECT,
and the other is for suspended-but-enabled ports.  (You've argued the latter
would be handled by a separate mechanism; fair enough, but I'm pointing
out that it's still a regression.)

The original autosuspend logic would never kick in without PM; after all,
it's purely a power saving mechanism!  And testing device_may_wakeup() will
be restoring that behavior, since without PM that's always false.
