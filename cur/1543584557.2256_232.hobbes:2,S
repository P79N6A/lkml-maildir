page->index << PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT is the byte offset of this page
in the mapping.
The comment is crap, that should be removed (page->offset does
not exist anymore). 
Rik did this in his documentation patch or will do it, if he
reads this ;-)

Which is discussed already in another thread at lkml. I hope that
we'll get a 64bit blocklayer one day in 2.5/2.6 development.
Since this is only around 2 years and might be backported to 2.4
if needed, I don't see a big problem of deferring this.
Let's leave some market niche for commercial solutions for a while ;-)

Ahh. I thought you've meant DEVICE drivers. If I talk about
drivers, I usally mean that. 
May be you should raise these issues again under a separate
subject and CC linux-fsdevel@vger.redhat.com for this.
I think it is worth it, because Linus want all fs to use page
cache for meta data and let buffer cache die slowly.
Basically the rules go like this:
The VM will wait for PG_locked pages, before it accesses them or
ignore them, if it cannot wait.
It will also try to read in pages, that are not PG_uptodate.
But user space will never see metadata pages anyway, so you
should be the only one, who cares about them. Just be prepared to
writepage() and readpage() and the like.
Just use lock_page() if you can sleep and TryLockPage() + EFAULT
(or similar) if you cannot.
Then just check Page_Uptodate() before you read and do
ClearUptodate() if you start writing to the metadata.
Since these operations are atomic bit operations, it should
suffice for your purpose.
But as stated above, I'm not very sure that I understand all the
code and know of all the races.
Multiple readers are AFAICS not yet possible with the current page
cache.
