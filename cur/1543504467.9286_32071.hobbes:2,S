14.31818Mhz/12/65536=18.2065Hz. Damn I made a miscalculation, you are
obviously correct. I stand corrected for that remark.
The 14.31818Mhz, the approx. 18.2Hz, the original PC/XT's 4.77Mhz, and
NTSC colours, they are all connected.

... And the document I refer to below explains what tricks you can do in
detail with example source code, images and all.
However, I don't see what that has to do with that the timer tick is *not*
a result from a choice of 65536 ticks per hour, but a result of four times
the NTSC colour sub carrier divided by 12*65536 (which results in approx
65543 ticks per hour btw).
Find "FAQ / Application notes: Timing on the PC family under DOS", in the
file msdos/info/pctim003.zip on simtel, and it will tell you about the
hardware and which confirms what I said in my last mail, including the
independent clock source for the CMOS clock. The pctim003.zip archive also
contains some nice explanatory images about the original PC hardware
structure.

## 2.1  THE BIG PICTURE
The 14.31818 MHz system clock is divided by 12 to give a 1.193182 MHz
clock (period is 0.8381 microseconds) which clocks the three channels of
the 8253/8254 counter/timer chip (CTC).  The CTC divides this frequency to
lower frequencies using programmable divisors, and produces three output
signals.
CTC channel zero's output is connected directly to IRQ0 on the primary PIC (8259
interrupt controller chip), and generates int 8, the timer tick interrupt, about
18.2065 times per second, or once every 54.9254 milliseconds.  The timer tick is
a regular interrupt which allows certain actions (such as updating the system
time-of-day) to be executed periodically.
Interrupt 8 is serviced by the ROM-BIOS.  The BIOS's int 8 handler increments
the BIOS tick count variable (a 32-bit variable used for timekeeping) and turns
off the floppy disk drive motors two seconds after they were last accessed.  It
also issues int 1C hex, which may be used as a regular interrupt source by user
programs.
The BIOS tick count is a 32-bit counter at low memory address 0040:006C, which
contains the number of timer ticks (units of 54.9254 ms) since midnight and is
used by DOS to calculate the time of day.
CTC channels 1 and 2 can also be used for timing, via the Refresh Detect and
Timer 2 readback signals on Port B.  Channel 2 also generates audio for the
PC speaker, and can be used in conjunction with channel 0 for PWM audio
generation.
The CTC divides its 1.193182 MHz clock down to 18.2065 Hz using a 16-bit
counter.  It is possible to read the actual count in progress in the CTC.
In combination with the tick count variable, this can give an absolute time
value, in units of 0.8381 us, for timestamping, elapsed time calculation, etc.
In some applications, a timer tick rate faster than 18.2065 times per second is
required.  This can be achieved by reprogramming the CTC.  The CTC is told to
generate the timer tick at a faster rate, and the program intercepts the timer
tick interrupt (int 8).  The int 8 handler does its thing, and calls the old
int 8 handler at the correct rate (18.2065 times per second) to maintain the
correct system time.
The Real Time Clock (RTC) was introduced with the AT, and all hardware-
compatible ATs and later machines have one.  The RTC is completely independent
of the CTC.  It uses a 32.768 kHz watch crystal for timekeeping and is battery
backed up (i.e. continues to keep time while the computer is powered off).
It can be used to generate a periodic interrupt, usually at 1024 Hz (1024
interrupts per second).

## 7.1  THE 14.31818 MHZ CLOCK
A crystal oscillator or oscillator module generates a 14.31818 MHz clock which
is divided by 12 to give the 1.1931816666666... MHz clock frequency (period is
12/14318180, or 0.83809534452 us), which is fed to all three channels of the
counter/timer chip.  This is the basic timing resolution of the counter/timer.
## 7.2  CLOCK FREQUENCY ACCURACY
The 14.31818 MHz clock's absolute accuracy depends mainly on the quality of the
14.31818 MHz crystal or crystal oscillator module, and is typically in the
region of +/- 5 ppm (0.0005%; 0.4 seconds per day) to +/- 20 ppm (0.002%; 1.73
seconds per day).  Errors consist of initial frequency error, and variations
due to temperature and long-term drift.  Because of these inaccuracies, there
is little point in specifying times or frequencies to more than five or six
digits as I have done above.
If required, frequency accuracy can be improved by installing a high quality,
close-tolerance crystal, or a high quality crystal oscillator module, which
will reduce all of the above error sources.  If accuracy is still inadequate,
with a crystal it may be possible to add a small variable capacitor to the
oscillator circuit, to 'pull' the crystal onto the correct frequency.  If
anyone has specific advice on this, please let me know.  (*)
Alternatively, your software could incorporate an adjustment so that once the
amount of error has been measured, manually by the user over a long period of
time, it could be corrected by the software.  Of course this must be configured
individually for every machine the software will run on, and temperature and
long term drift will still have an effect.
Historical note:  If you were wondering "Wouldn't 1 MHz have been easier?", yes
it would, but that would have required an extra crystal.  IBM were...  er,
'clever' - they used a master clock of 14.31818 MHz, and used logic chips to
derive the 4.77 MHz CPU clock, the timer clock, and the NTSC colour subcarrier
frequency for the CGA card, so they could save a few dollars.  Although the
14.31818 MHz signal is not required by modern CPUs and video cards (in fact,
it is now only used for the CTC clock!), the strange frequency still hangs
around like a stale fart - we are stuck with it forever.  :-(

## 7.4  CTC CHANNELS
Each channel operates independently, and can be programmed for one of six modes
of operation.  Normally, modes 2 or 3 are used.  In these modes, the CTC channel
takes the CTC clock (1.193182 MHz) and 'divides' this frequency down to produce
a lower frequency at the output pin.  Other modes operate differently.
The frequency division is controlled by the 'divisor' value, a 16-bit unsigned
number between 1 and 65536 (65536 is represented as zero), which is individually
programmable for each channel in the CTC.  Setting a very small divisor value
gives a very high output frequency.  A divisor of 65536 gives the lowest output
frequency, 18.206507364909 Hz (cycle period is 54.92541649846559 ms).
## 7.4.1  CTC CHANNEL ZERO
CTC channel zero normally operates in mode two or three with a divisor of
65536, giving an output frequency of 18.2065 Hz (period is 54.9254 ms).  Its
gate input is tied high.  Its output drives the IRQ0 input of the primary PIC
(8259 interrupt controller chip).  On every rising edge of the channel zero
output pin (i.e. transition from low to high), IRQ0 is triggered, invoking
interrupt 8, the timer tick interrupt (see section <AF><AF> 6.1).

That is wrong. There are close to 65543 ticks per hour 
(60*60*14.31818e6/65536/12).
How else would you explain that a 14.31818Mhz crystal can be found in a
system with a 8253/8254 clock chip in its hardware that has no divider
higher than 65536?
Let's look at pin 30B is the standadizes PC104 (~=ISA) connector

OSC: Oscillator, 14.318 MHz, 50% Duty Cycle. Frequency varies.
        This was originally divided by 3 to provide the 4.77 MHz cpu
        clock of early PCs, and divided by 12 to produce the 1.19 MHz
        system clock. Some references have placed this signal as low
        as 1 MHz (possibly referencing the system clock), but most modern
        systems use 14.318 MHz.
        This frequency (14.318 MHz) is four times the television colorburst
        frequency.
        Refresh timing on many PC's is based on OSC/18, or approximately
        one refresh cycle every 15 microseconds. Many modern motherboards
        allow this rate to be changed, which frees up some bus cycles for
        use by software, but also can cause memory errors if the system
        RAM cannot handle the slower refresh rates.
