As good an idea POSIX capabilities might be, not all security problems 
can be solved with a bitmap of on/off permissions.

Ok but what happens to the principle of least privilege?
What if we want AppArmor to confine that application to use a particular 
set of ports?
Do you propose having a capability for each port? how about protocols?
So unless my understanding of capabilities is fundamentally flawed 
(which it may be - I have not spent time reviewing recent changes) 
obviously Linux capabilities does not provide a solution to every problem.
