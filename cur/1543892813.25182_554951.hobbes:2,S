It works fine. The only problem is that if I set a _standard_ baud rate
with BOTHER and then read it back with something that doesn't grok
BOTHER, I get it back just as I set it.
[root@pegasos ~]# ./testit1 
Get: c_flag 0x1f0b1f(31,31), ispeed 38400, ospeed 38400
[root@pegasos ~]# stty
speed 0 baud; line = 0;
It might be better if it was returning B38400, rather than BOTHER.
Should we be using tty_termios_encode_baud_rate() for TCGETS()?
