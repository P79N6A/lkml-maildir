Is that 20k all the time?  What about when buffers are almost always empty?
What if the window in one or both directions is set to, say, 4k?
What is the minimum?  What if the window was automatically set low, say 2k,
and automatically raised to some reasonable size (15k, 30k) based on the
largest continuous burst?
I really can't see how the kernel needs more than 2-4k without buffers and why
those can't be allocated dynamically.  Of course I haven't tried to fully
grock the code yet.  Enlightenment welcome, as always.

Now that's interesting...
