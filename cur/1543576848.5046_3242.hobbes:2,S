While I am not familiar with mtx and the process you
are having problems with, 'man 1 mtx' contains the 
following:
       The first argument, given following -f, is the SCSI
       generic device corresponding to your media changer.
On the basis of the /proc/scsi/scsi output you have shown,
the mtx commands should read "mtx -f /dev/sg2 ..." 
(not /dev/sg1) as you have noted at the top.
Given those 2 sg devices are closely coupled (just
differing by the lun) mtx probably can sort this out.
