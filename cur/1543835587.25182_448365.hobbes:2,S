OK, if you meant this one (that hadn't shown up here before I hit 'send'):

That has slightly different semantics indeed, and avoids the issue I
was commenting about.  A gkrellm-ish program can query every 100ms and
get a cached value 49 times out of 50 for a value that's hardware-updated
every 5 seconds, and all will be well (of course, there's room for some
added optimization, but I suspect trying to add that will end up more
expensive than just re-reading the same cached value, unless the kernel has
a good way to pass back a good hint of when the next update will be...)
