Sorry for the delay. I cannot try the patch in this moment, because my
server is in production. I will try the patch next days, but I think I
cannot reproduce the error, because I made "local" some data mounted
with NFS.
In samba list, some people that have data mounted with NFS are getting
similar problems. I will let they know about this patch.
Thanks a lot,
