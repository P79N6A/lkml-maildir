Subject: [PATCH] setrlimit incorrectly allows hard limits to exceed soft limits

Hi,
In 2.4.19 (also 2.5.46) setrlimit code only ever makes a comparison to
check the old soft limit with the new soft limit and the new hard
limit with the old hard limit.  There is never a check to ensure the
new soft limit never exceeds the new hard limit. 
Just try "ulimit -H -m 10000" for memory limits that were not
previously set.  You end up with (hard limit = 10000) < (soft limit =
unlimited).
Fix is trivial.
