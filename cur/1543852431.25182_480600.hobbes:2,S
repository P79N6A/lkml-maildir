So it works with systems that don't use the interrupt ? Is this some
kind of PDA type device designed for Windows CE where they've not
bothered wiring the interrupt perhaps.
If so you'll need to write a polling CF driver for it, which actually is
one of those things that we could do with for some other embedded cases
too.
