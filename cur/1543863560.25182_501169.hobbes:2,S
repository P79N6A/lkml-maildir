Ok.  Since it seems to be the irq code I'm going to need to get a dump
of the state of the apics, basically the output print_IO_APIC from the time
this happens. 
I'm not really out of bed yet so no patch but a heads up.  Once I've finished
sleeping I'll look at putting a debugging patch together.
Getting a bootlog of the identical system that would not crash at 8 cpus
would be interesting.  In part this is because the number of apic modes
that are available for use are much fewer when we have 8 or more cpus,
so it would be interesting to see if it is actually using the same code
for interrupt delivery.
If you have a few minutes to try it, it would be interesting to know
if forcing the migration from the command line (as I was suggesting)
would reproduce this faster than irqbalance.
Hopefully I can think up things to fix this when I wake up.
The time zone difference is going to be a pain :(
