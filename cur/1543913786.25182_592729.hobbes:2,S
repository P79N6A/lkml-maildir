static inline int
qla2x00_wait_for_loop_ready(scsi_qla_host_t *ha)
{
        int      return_status = QLA_SUCCESS;
        unsigned long loop_timeout ;
        scsi_qla_host_t *pha = to_qla_parent(ha);
        /* wait for 5 min at the max for loop to be ready */
        loop_timeout = jiffies + (MAX_LOOP_TIMEOUT * HZ);
        while ((!atomic_read(&pha->loop_down_timer) &&
            atomic_read(&pha->loop_state) == LOOP_DOWN) ||
            atomic_read(&pha->loop_state) != LOOP_READY) {
                if (atomic_read(&pha->loop_state) == LOOP_DEAD) {
                        return_status = QLA_FUNCTION_FAILED;
                        break;
                }
                msleep(1000);
                if (time_after_eq(jiffies, loop_timeout)) {
                        return_status = QLA_FUNCTION_FAILED;
                        break;
                }
        }
        return (return_status);
}
Is above correct or buggy? Correct, because msleep is a barrier.
Is it obvious? No.
static void
qla2x00_rst_aen(scsi_qla_host_t *ha)
{
        if (ha->flags.online && !ha->flags.reset_active &&
            !atomic_read(&ha->loop_down_timer) &&
            !(test_bit(ABORT_ISP_ACTIVE, &ha->dpc_flags))) {
                do {
                        clear_bit(RESET_MARKER_NEEDED, &ha->dpc_flags);
                        /*
                         * Issue marker command only when we are going to start
                         * the I/O.
                         */
                        ha->marker_needed = 1;
                } while (!atomic_read(&ha->loop_down_timer) &&
                    (test_bit(RESET_MARKER_NEEDED, &ha->dpc_flags)));
        }
}
Is above correct? I honestly don't know. Correct, because set_bit is
a barrier on _all _memory_? Will it break if set_bit will be changed
to be a barrier only on its operand? Probably yes.
drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c
        while (atomic_read(&completed) != needed) {
                cpu_relax();
                barrier();
        }
Obviously author did not know that cpu_relax is already a barrier.
See why I think driver authors will be confused?
arch/x86_64/kernel/crash.c
static void nmi_shootdown_cpus(void)
{
...
        msecs = 1000; /* Wait at most a second for the other cpus to stop */
        while ((atomic_read(&waiting_for_crash_ipi) > 0) && msecs) {
                mdelay(1);
                msecs--;
        }
...
}
Is mdelay(1) a barrier? Yes, because it is a function on x86_64.
Absolutely the same code will be buggy on an arch where
mdelay(1) == udelay(1000), and udelay is implemented
as inline busy-wait.
arch/sparc64/kernel/smp.c
        /* Wait for response */
        while (atomic_read(&data.finished) != cpus)
                cpu_relax();
...later in the same file...
                while (atomic_read(&smp_capture_registry) != ncpus)
                        rmb();
I'm confused. Do we need cpu_relax() or rmb()? Does cpu_relax() imply rmb()?
(No it doesn't). Which of those two while loops needs correcting?
