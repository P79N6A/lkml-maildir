No it's not. It's a SO problem. It relies on features in glibc-2.0.7 which
are not present in glibc-2.1. The glibc boys ('n gals) assures me that if
they did not do that, *and* did it right, there would not have been any
problems installing SO on a glibc-2.1 system. And as such, SO developers
_are_ a bunch of lamers. The majority of glibc binaries don't have such
problems because they don't go right into the glibc internals.

Nice idea but impracticable for a suite as large as SO.  Fuck it, I'm
getting Applixware 4.4.1 to try out.
Cheers,
Alex
