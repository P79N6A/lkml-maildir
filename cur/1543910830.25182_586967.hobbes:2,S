Ok, I see now that the 1.1ms was for the 10000 iterations, which makes
it about 230 ns/iteration for the 10000 times kmalloc(8) = 2.3ms test.
As I am going back through the initial cmpxchg_local implementation, it
seems like it was executing __slab_alloc() with preemption disabled,
which is wrong. new_slab() is not designed for that.
I'll try to run my tests on AMD64.
