I do see what you're saying here.  But it does take the away the ability of a 
licensee to protect themselves from another malicious licensee.  If the ultimate 
goal of the Free Software community is to get source code out to the public, I 
think that was captured in GPLv2.  GPLv3 oversteps its bounds.
Anyways I think this topic has been quite covered.
