Nobody can point you there, because it doesn't say that anywhere.
What you do to *your* kernel is *your* business.
The question is what the code you *distribute* to *other* people does. It's
perfectly legal to load proprietary modules into the kernel.  The open question
is whether you're allowed to ship a proprietary module to somebody else.
And that will depend in *great* detail on *exactly* what your module does,
what code it uses, and how it does it.  As others have pointed out, NVidia
and ATI think they're in an OK spot with the way *they* do *their* module,
while many embedded companies, shipping a much different product, have almost
unanimously given in rather than risk a court fight about the GPL.
Of course, most companies will cave in and license rather than fight a
patent troll as well - so you *really* need to discuss *your* case with
a clueful lawyer.
