fork/exec/sh regressions will be mostly due to the unfortunate
4level page tables regressions which have been fixed after 2.6.11.
Also, on the SMP machine, you should bind the entire lmbench test
to just one of the CPUs, because changes to SMP balancing can have
disproportionate or unrealistic changes.
It would be good if you could compare again with the latest 2.6.12
-git release.
Thanks,
Nick
