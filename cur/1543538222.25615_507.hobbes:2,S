Hi, Andi.
Writing to the k/b is a simple outb() and yes, the statefulness of the
host<->mouse-or-kb protocol presumably requires the higher level
serialisation.
But my question was: how often are aux_write_dev() and aux_write_ack()
actually called?
From my reading, it's only when:
- The system is booted
- /dev/psaux is opened
- /dev/psaux is written to
If these are sufficiently rare events, we can shrug and move on, no?
