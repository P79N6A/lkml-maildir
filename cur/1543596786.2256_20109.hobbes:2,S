I don't know exactly what is happening, but I do know _who_ is causing
the problem I'm seeing.. it's tmpfs.  When mounted on /tmp and running
X/KDE, the tar [1] will oom my box every time because page_launder trys
and always failing to get anything scrubbed after the tar has run for a
while.  Unmount tmpfs/restart X and do the same tar, and all is well.
(it's not locked pages aparantly. I modified page_launder to move those
to the active list, and refill_inactive_scan to rotate them to the end
of the active list.  inactive_dirty list still grows ever larger, filling
with 'stuff' that page_launder can't clean until you're totally oom)
