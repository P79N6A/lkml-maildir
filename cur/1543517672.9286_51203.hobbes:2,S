Well, I use the very latest tulip driver that is provided by Donald
Becker, and that's what works best for me.(v0.91)

The article in LJ explains how to compile the code, but it is very
straight forward, you can even just use 'tail tulip.c' to get the
compile command, and cut and paste it into your xterm. Usually you want
gcc -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -c tulip.c `[ -f
/usr/include/linux/modversions.h ] && echo -DMODVERSIONS`
unless you have an SMP machine.
then use:
gcc -D__SMP__ -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -c
tulip.c `[ -f /usr/include/linux/modversions.h ] && echo -DMODVERSIONS`
There's also a linux-tulip mailing list or you can just read the on-line
archives.

Good Luck.
