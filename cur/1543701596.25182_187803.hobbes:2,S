But in short you always get some syscall from userspace and have some table with function vectors assigned to each syscall, don't you?
So you can have something like "append_this_function_before_syscall_sys_open" and "append_this_function_after_syscall_sys_open" which would be platform independent but will have platform dependent implementation.
