Yes, it is.  I was hoping it to be not more expensive on most archs.
It isn't on x86 at the very least but I don't know much about other
archs.

Requiring NMI-safeness is quite an exception, I suppose.  I don't
think we should design around it.  If it can be worked around one way
or the other, it should be fine.

I like local better too but no biggies one way or the other.

Yes, right.  Got confused there.  Hmmm... looks like what would work
there is "is it a lvalue?" test.  Well, anyways, if it isn't
necessary.

Hey, didn't know Australia was founded on lunar New Year's day.
Nice. :-)
Thanks.
