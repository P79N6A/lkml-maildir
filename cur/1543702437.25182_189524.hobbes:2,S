Ok, I retried my test without the filemap_write_and_wait() that is not
protected by i_sem and the test still sees uninitialized data.  I'm
still running with test10-mm1 + all the patches I sent out before.
I'm haven't tried 2.6.0-rc*-mm1 yet.  I need to move all my debug code
over to the latest mm kernel.  I also did not want to change too much
at same time.
