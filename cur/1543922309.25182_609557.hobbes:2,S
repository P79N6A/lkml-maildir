Of course, the example I gave assumed that each LSM had disjunctive
features. Apparmor is primarily known for blocking file access,
and portac for blocking bind(2). If one of these gets additionaly
functionality, it would be nice that code gets combined so that
tracking down the piece of code that caused a particular syscall to
say nay is easier to pinpoint.

I agree - if one does not get the magic behind LSM stacking, s/he
should not use it, or learn to use it.
However, if you grasp how it works (probably even easier to learn
than figuring out how to selinux), one should know that a pam_deny.so
even after a pam_permit.so will lock you down. Yeah, it's like PAM
stacking.
