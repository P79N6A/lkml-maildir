As far as I'm concerned, CAP_SYS_RAWIO is obvious.  A fairly
shocking amount of stuff appears to fall under the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
banner, and I don't think that messing with hardware settings,
directly or otherwise, should be included there.  I think that
CAP_SYS_RAWIO rather fits, but CAP_SYS_ADMIN certainly doesn't.
CAP_SYS_RAWIO defends from user programs:
 * poking at hardware
 * changing hardware settings via the kernel
My intention with the small patches which went into 2.2 and
2.3 was that by turning off CAP_SYS_RAWIO and CAP_SYS_MODULE
(the purpose of which is fairly clear) it should, in theory,
be impossible to subvert the kernel or kill the box.
I have a patch which turns a lot of CAP_SYS_ADMINs into
CAP_SYS_RAWIO, for things like serial device config ioctls,
writes to /proc/bus/pci, etc.
The onlycomplaint I can imagine about it is that some of
thee things should perhaps fall under CAP_SYS_HWCONFIG, as
it could be argued that they don't quite fit under the
original CAP_SYS_RAWIO.
Matthew.
