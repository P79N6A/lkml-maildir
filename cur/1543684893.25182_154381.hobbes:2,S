I don't know the system, so I can only judge from your description:
if they allow mount of something insive the cvs tree, then you have a
mountpoint and can --exclude=mountpoint. You don't run into the system root and
are fine, right? If you don't have known fixed mountpoints use mount -l to find
out.
