A tasklet does not run in interrupt context, it runs as a high priority thread,
that is scheduled from either user or interrupt context. The purpose is mostly
to defer workloads from interrupt context, to reduce the time spent with
interrupts disabled.
It would make sense to defer work from userspace to a tasklet if the hardware
takes an unusual amount of time to process the userspace data.
Correct me if I'm wrong :)
