Purpose:
1. weak security enhancement
2. cosmetic (backwards, IMHO)
3. speed (avoid PIDs likely to be used)
I'd much prefer LRU allocation. There are
lots of system calls that take PID values.
All such calls are hazardous. They're pretty
much broken by design.
Better yet, make a random choice from
the 50% of PID space that has been least
recently used.
Another idea is to associate PIDs with users
to some extent. You keep getting back the same
set of PIDs unless the system runs low in some
global pool and has to steal from one user to
satisfy another.
BTW, since pid_max is now adjustable, reducing
the default to 4 digits would make sense. Try a
"ps j" to see the use. (column width changes if
you change max_pid)
