I presume you are talking about the ioctl.  I have tried to engage you
and others on what exactly you prefer instead.  I have said that moving
to a write interface is fine but I don't see how ut is _any_ better than
the ioctl.  Write is less typed, in fact, since we lose the command
versus argument delineation.
But if it is a anonymous decision, I'll switch it.  Or take patches. ;-)
It isn't a big deal.
