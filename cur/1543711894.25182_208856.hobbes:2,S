Sorry, but IIRC both burnBX and burnMMX don't test a large portion of RAM,
but only a small amount (4 MB ?) by default. So it's fairly possible that
without options, it runs on your on-board RAM only. I believe you had to
specify it a letter as a first and only parameter. I used 'P' which meant
64 MB. I don't remember if you have higher sizes, but at least you can
start several of them in parallel to lock more memory.
