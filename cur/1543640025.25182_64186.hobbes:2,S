Linus, I'm curious if the NFSv4 patches will be accepted in the near 
future (ie, before 2.6).
I for one would REALLY like to see NFSv4 (actually, Kerberized NFSv4 is 
what I'm after).   I just finished setting up a Kerberized Solaris NFS 
environment with home directories automounted from the clients with 
strong user authentication.
Frankly, the stock (non-Kerberized) NFS security model blows.
The fact that any janitor with a laptop (or any client with a malicious
root user) can nuke all home directories from a standard NFS home
directory server bothers me greatly.
