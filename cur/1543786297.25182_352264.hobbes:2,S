Hi, All.
    I found there are use double operator ! continuously sometimes in 
kernel.
e.g:
    static inline int is_page_cache_freeable(struct page *page)
    {
        return page_count(page) - !!PagePrivate(page) == 2;
    }
    Who would like tell me why write like above?
   
  
    Thanks in advanced.
Liyu
