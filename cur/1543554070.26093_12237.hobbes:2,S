There is NO guarantee that module use count == device open count.  Never
has been, AFAIK.  It just happens to work out that way on a lot of
pre-2.4 code.
The kernel is free to bump the module reference count up and down as it
pleases.  For example, if a driver creates a kernel thread, that will
increase its module usage count by one, for the duration of the kernel
thread's lifetime.
The only rule is that you cannot unload a module until its use count it
zero.
