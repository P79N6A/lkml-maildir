I spent quite some time looking at the kernel code for capabilities and also how to
control them from userland. I agree with you that it would be nicer to use capabilities
to control which users can create system-wide or per-thread perfmon sessions. We could
simply create two new capabilities: CAP_PERFMON_SYS and CAP_PERFMON_THREAD. Then,
I can envision a setup where a sysadmin would grant the capabilities to users when they login
via PAM.
There are two problems with this at the moment:
	- the 32bit for capabilities have been exhausted (kernel_cap_t is u32). We would
	  need to increase to u64. That would impact __user_cap_data_struct which is used
	  by the captset()/capget() syscalls.
	- I have not been able to find how one could grant/deny capabilities via PAM and
	  especially for login. Libcap does not seem to be used. There was a pam_cap at
	  some point, it seems abandonned by now.  I am not a linux security
	  expert, so there may be newer ways of setting capabilities for processes.
Any comments?
