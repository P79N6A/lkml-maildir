If you're talking about things like setting up multiheaded UP and 
dual-processor machines for, say, an undergraduate lab in a university, 
then I think you're probably on the right track -- *especially* if the 
alternative would be using X-terminals (gack!!!) to leech the CPU power 
anyway.
Otherwise, I think that's probably the main "minicomputeresque" form of 
Linux usage -- remote X display.
