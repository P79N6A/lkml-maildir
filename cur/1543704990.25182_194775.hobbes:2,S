I've been fiddling with cleaning up some old code here and suggest the
following to make Lindent match actual practice more closely. This does:
a) (no -psl)
void *foo(void) {
 instead of
void *
foo(void) {
b) (no -bs) "sizeof(foo)" rather than "sizeof (foo)"
c) (-ncs) "(void *)foo" rather than "(void *) foo"
