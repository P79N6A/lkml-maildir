That's true only in the case of a "filled write queue" (I don't know 
exactly how it's working). However, I verified that the average SCSI 
command takes less than two seconds to complete in this case (time between 
send to card and receive response interrupt).
BTW: was it directly clear for you for what the do_journal_begin_r() was 
waiting? I'm not so familiar with fs coding, especially the locking...
While we're at it: it looks like e.g. the 3ware driver is busy waiting in
tw_scsi_queue() until (by virtue of an interrupt?) a request_id becomes
free. Is this common practice? Or is there code somewhere checking for the
availability of these request slots before calling scsi_queue? I would
think that the CPU can do more useful things while waiting for an
interrupt...

Do you use IDE or SCSI? It seems like the SCSI drivers can have up to 
255*256 sectors pending on the controller. If that's the problem, how can 
I decrease this buffering?

The call trace was from 2.4.19, and the situation actually was much better 
than in the 2.4.18-3 case, where it took about 1 minute for ls to come 
back.
