As for async-thread, kernel/ seems to be better place (sorry, I also hit
send too soon ;)
Anyway, I think it should be reviewed deeply by scheduler people and
wider range of people.  So, it's a good idea to put it out in order to
arouse interest.

The extent_map itself seemed independent of the problem to me, but I
understand your plan.
Btrfs seems to have other helpful code including pages/bio compression
which may become separable, too.  And, this may be the same for
pages/bio encryption/decryption code which would come next.  (I don't
mention about the volume management/raid feature here to avoid getting
off the subject, but it's likewise).
I think it's wonderful if they can be well-integrated into sublayers
or libraries.
