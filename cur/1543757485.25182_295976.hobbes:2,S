I'm kicking myself because I thought about this 2 minutes after we
talked on IRC.  
One issue is that it doesn't work with DISCONTIGMEM (or the upcoming
sparsemem).  max_mapnr doesn't exist on those systems, and on the really
discontiguous ones, you might be allocating very large areas with very
sparse maps.
One thing that I've been thinking about for these things is something
tree-based.  A 1 or 2-level tree, like pagetables should be fast enough,
and handle the sparse and discontiguous layouts a little better than a
flat one.  We could even do a flat bitmap for normal systems, and #ifdef
in the table only when it's needed.  I can take a look at doing this
next week.
