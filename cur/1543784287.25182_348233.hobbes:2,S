this is wrong.  The structure is in ioremaped memory so you must
use reads/writes to access them instead.  volatile usage in drivers
is never okay - if you are accessing I/O memory you need to use
proper acessors, if it is normal memory and you want atomic sematics
you need to use the atomic_t type and the operators defined on it.
