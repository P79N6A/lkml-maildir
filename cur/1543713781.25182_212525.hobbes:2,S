scsi_add_device is being called from keventd by the ipr LLD. I am assuming this
is a reasonable thing to do. If not, then I would argue the scsi_add_device API
is broken as it must be called from task level, and if a LLD cannot use keventd,
then every LLD that wants to use it would need to create its own workqueue thread.
