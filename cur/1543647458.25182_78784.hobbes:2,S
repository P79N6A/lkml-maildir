Then perhaps O_STREAMING should be called O_EXTENDEDSTREAMING.
If you overload O_STREAMING to contain all possibile uses for sequential
reads, you end up hurting yourself.
Small files are different beasts from large files. If you want O_STREAMING
to work in all cases, you really want standard mode to work in all cases,
and O_STREAMING is not for you.
