Apparently I posted this in the middle of an unrelated thread by 
mistake. If this is the third message you are getting in regard to this 
issue, sorry :( Just trying to get it in the right place.

I have an Asus Striker Extreme motherboard with two built in MCP55 GigE 
interfaces. When I build with the original Fedora 7 release kernel ( 
ftp://ftp.belnet.be/linux/fedora/linux/releases/7/Fedora/i386/os/Fedora/kernel-2.6.21-1.3194.fc7.i686.rpm
 
) everything works fine. However, when I boot with any updated kernels 
or any other kernel (have tried building from several points in the 
linus git tree between 2.6.20 and .23-rc3, and 2.6.21.2 in -stable) I 
cannot get an IP address via dhcp. There is no error in dmesg. The card 
shows a link and otherwise appears to be working, but it is as if the 
dhcp server has been removed from the network.
On a running system there is no indication that this is a kernel bug at 
all, however by varying only the kernel the bug appears and disappears. 
I've run all these tests repeatedly with no intervening updates of any 
other packages.
As I said I attempted to build 2.6.21.2 ( the point of divergence 
between the Fedora kernel in question and -stable ) and still the card 
did not work. I will next attempt to manually build the rpm for the 
release kernel. If this works I will try experimenting with the included 
patches to narrow it down, but at this point I'm at a complete loss.
