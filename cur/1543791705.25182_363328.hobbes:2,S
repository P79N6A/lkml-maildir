It will basically disable ACPI Processor Power Management features. 
P-state (speedstep or dynamic change of frequency to save power) and
C-states beyond C1 and T-states. 
From dmesg, I know that on your system C2 and beyond is not supported.
T-states are kind of unimportantish. Only other difference will be
P-state. Not sure whether your processor supports speedstep and dynamic
change of cpufreq. If it doesn't, then you won't loose anything by this
workaround.
Thanks,
Venki
