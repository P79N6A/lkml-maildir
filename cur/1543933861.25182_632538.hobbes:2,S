It certainly supports MMCplus. My understanding is that eMMC
is just a form-factor and is not visibly different to the host
controller, so it should just work. I know that the nokia n810
has an internal eMMC and it, obviously, works. They had some
odd issues with the Samsung part they're using and SET_BLOCK_COUNT
but I have no idea if that's an eMMC thing or specific to the part
they're using.
You also asked about "28bit lba" support in another email. I assume
you are asking about support for block addressed SDHC and MMCplus-HC cards.
The kernel supports both (although good luck trying to get a hold of an MMC
one).
Hope that helps,
