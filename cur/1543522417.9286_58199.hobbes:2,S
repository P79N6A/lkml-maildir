It's YOUR choice. You have EXACTLY two choices:
  1. allow ORBS to probe you then you can sent mail to me (or any other ORBS
user like l-k ml)
or
  2. disallow ORBS to probe you and then you eventually can not sent mail to
me (or any other user like l-k ml)
If you do not need to send mail to l-k you are free to block ORBS (or, better
yet just ask ORBS to not probe you: read 
http://www.rahul.net/dhesi/orbs.faq.txt
)
If you are not interested in communication with l-k, Cox, Rik and so on you
can block ORBS, ignore ORBS, set up open relay on your host, whatever.
