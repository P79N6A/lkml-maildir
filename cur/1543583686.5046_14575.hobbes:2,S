Hello!
> this kernel was compiled with GCC 2.95.2,
This is a hint.
Could you make the following things:
1. to disassemble tcp_poll() (the easiest way is to gdb vmlinux, to 
   say x/i tcp_poll and to hold enter pressed long enough, copying screen
   to file) and to send the result to me.
2. to apply the enclosed patchlet.
3. if 3 does not change anything, recompile with egcs-1.1.2
Alexey
