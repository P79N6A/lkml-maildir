+General statistics about what the kernel has been doing is available

+The individual "cpu" entry is will be the same as "cpu0" if you only
+have one CPU on your system.  Otherwise the "cpu" entry will be a
+total of all the separate CPU statistics.  The four numbers following
+"cpu" entries are: user, nice, system and idle usage.  These are
+stored in jiffies.
+
+The two numbers following the "page" entry are number of pages going
+in followed by the number of pages going out.  Same goes for the
+"swap" entry.
+
+The "intr" entry show the number of interrupts.  The first number is
+the total interrupts between all IRQs.  The remaining numbers are the
+interrupts for each IRQ in order.
+
+The "disk_io" shows data for each active disk.  The above example only
+shows one active disk.  The first pair is the major followed by the
+disk number entry.  The others are:
+     - total number of I/O operations on this drive
+     - read I/O operations
+     - read I/O sectors
+     - write I/O operations
+     - write I/O sectors
+
+"ctxt" the the contest switches.
+
+"btime" is the time the system booted.
+
+"processes" is the number of processes that have run since boot.  This
+includes forks, don't know if it includes threads.
