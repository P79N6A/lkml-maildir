*snort*
Well, the only support script here is "call rpmbuild with the right
arguments" (and kmk, which is about running kernel cross-build
conveniently and has nothing to do with building cross-toolchain
itself).
I'll need to update that to more current gcc anyway (and see if that
takes care of sh/sh64), so if you can dig those .spec out... throw
them my way and I'll add them to repository.
How well do they handle the targets for which you have no glibc-dev
binary rpms, BTW?  I needed headers for ia64 and ppc64; both fortunately
are among the generally supported targets...
