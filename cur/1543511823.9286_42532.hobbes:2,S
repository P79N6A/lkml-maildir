This was a solution to the dynamic USB device assignment problem that I
proposed on 5 Oct 1999.  I don't think it made it to the linux-kernel
list, so here it is.
In a moment, I'll sent over to linux-kernel another posting I made to
linux-usb, which addresses some of the concerns raised by another
listmember.

Hrm... a slightly different take on the problem...
It was originally proposed (that is, the proposition which really kicked
this thread of discussion off) that we have a major number for USB
devices, and then assign the minor numbers in blocks to different types of
devices (i.e. a range for printers, a range for ACM, etc).
My understanding (and maybe I'm smoking crack here) is that there are only
127 devices allowed on a USB tree, and minor numbers go all the way up to
255.  So, why not simply have devices accessed by their device number?
That is to say, the first device on a USB tree is /dev/usb0.  The next is
/dev/usb1.  Our little user-space daemon will simply provide symbolic
links between, say, /dev/mouse and /dev/usb0 (if that's proper).  Minor
numbers are assigned by some sensible system (i.e. first-come
first-serve, or perhaps some topology based thing).
My initial look at this idea is that it might create some kind of
race-condition, if the device known as /dev/usb1 suddenly became known as
/dev/usb0 without anything actually happening to the device (but instead
other devices around it changing).  So, as long as a device, when plugged
in, is given a minor number, and that number doesn't change unless _that_
_device_ is removed and re-inserted, we should be clear of race
conditions.  It might be necessary to add the restriction that we try to
re-use minor numbers as infrequently as possible (like process ID
assignment does).
A special /dev/usbinfo entry can be used to pass event data from kernel
space to user space in some useful format, to drive the user-space daemon.
Heck, with an entire major number, we could have hundreds of paths for
information to flow from kernel space to user space, all relating to USB.
Topological info, device info, descriptors, statistics, etc. could all be
sent on separate minor numbers.
This solution has several advantages, as I see it:
1) It provides for low-level access to each USB device
2) It allows easy operation of high-level device names (as symlinks)
3) It leverages the existing solution (the /dev filesystem)
4) It eliminates contention for minor numbers (totally, as I see it)
5) It eliminates the need for a dynamic filesystem
#4 and #5 are the biggest gain from my point of view.  This will require
that USB devices which are not supposed to present a /dev entry do so, but
that entry could simply return a line of text that says "Go away.  We
don't do char interfaces".
Comments?

It was a new hope.
