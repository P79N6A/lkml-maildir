devfsd.conf:
REGISTER scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc CFUNCTION GLOBAL mksymlink $devname 
diska 
REGISTER scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/disc CFUNCTION GLOBAL mksymlink $devname 
diskb
REGISTER scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/disc CFUNCTION GLOBAL mksymlink $devname 
diskc
REGISTER scsi/host1/bus0/target1/lun0/disc CFUNCTION GLOBAL mksymlink $devname 
diskd
if you insist on calling them sda etc you may comment out MKOLDCOMPAT but 
beware of consequences.
but this breaks anyway if SCSI host numbers change (e.g. if you plug in new 
HBA) and for that there is no solution
