These drivers are hardly comparable. vt8623fb supports CLE266 with VGA output only,
but allows arbitrary resolutions and pixclocks, high-res text mode and
(partially) suspend/resume. viafb implements fixed resolutions only and
have no text mode and no suspend/resume support (according to my quick
look on it).
