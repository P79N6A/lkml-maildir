The main task for having software usable is _maintainance_.  What is the
most impolite behaviour with software is to make some development or some
tempering and then, to go away.  This apply to commercial companies and to
individual as well.  If one knows it will be unable to maintain his
software or find another maintainer, he should not provide anything. 
The second thing that I consider impolite it to shoe-horn one's name in
any source one has made some change. A minute or hour change is a detail
compared to the time needed to develop and to to maintain a whole
software.

There is a difference between the claimed maintainer status and the actual
maintainer status. A software that is either not officially or not
actually maintained should not be used anymore, in theory, since user
might just be stuck at the first failure he will experience. In practice,
having the source code, allows to try to fix the problem and it seems that
this generally succeed.  A software you have the source is _ALIVE_ for you
even if it is temporarily not maintained or not well maintained. A
binary-only software is perhaps just dead for you and you don't know it is 
so.

The original author still maintaining a software is an ideal situation,
not the reality we observe for all softwares. What you point out as
'so-called maintainers' are people that actually spend much time to make
software work. Without any maintainer a software is dead if binary-only
and in comma-mode if source-available, regardless the performance of the
original author(s).

The more appropriate place for the address of maintainers is trivially the
source code or some file that is tightly attached to the source code. Any
other place may contain a invalid or not up-to-date address. People that
want to use free software and donnot want to even look into the sources
must purchase a supported O/S package and pay for a commercial support.
For example, I receive, at least once a week, questions from end-users
that have problems with their RedHat installation and that think the
problem is related to the software I maintain. I donnot reply to these
people and am _not_ going to do so.

Why not to also pay for advertisements in all technical reviews and
end-user reviews that exist on the planet.

Some people should immediately stop drinking tequilla.
