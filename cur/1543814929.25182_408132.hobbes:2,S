Well I submitted them back on 2006-02-24:

It has been pointed out I did forget to CC the cpufreq folk, so thats 
completely my fault; I thought I had. :-/

Originally the 'conservative' feature was just a sysfs flag that could be set 
however it was rejected for a number of reasons; one of them quite rightly, 
we have a modular system that can take stacks of cpufreq governors so lets 
use that :)
Also, more importantly, bugs in my bits do not affect the original author. 
It makes more sense to keep things this way as the internal code then does
not need a bunch of if{}'s scattered around and also I have a number of extra
sysfs files to tweak which would either do nothing in 'ondemand' mode or have
to be magically created and destroyed.
Either way, its probably neater this way and its *my* duty to make sure
anything changing for ondemand is considered for conservative.  If you look
at a lot of the userland tools that have come out, it would be a pain to have
them consider the exception class of handling the combined
ondemand/conservative.
Breaking out the thing into a library probably would be awkward as all the
similar code is actually inline in functions, putting that in a seperate file
would be pointless.  Hopefully when you apply my patches and then do a diff
between the ondemand and conservative governors you will see what I mean.
Cheers
Alex
