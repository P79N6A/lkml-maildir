i thought it would be nice to finally hear something good about the OOM
killer.
i am testing Evolution (Ximian's GNOME emailer/groupware app), and the
latest Evolution cvs-snapshot went crazy when trying to copy a mail
folder.  my load averaged spiked, swap filled, and then i ran out of
memory.
*poof*, Evolution was killed, and everything returned to normal.
kernel showed:
Out of Memory: Killed process 1296 (evolution-mail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 1296 (evolution-mail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 1296 (evolution-mail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 1302 (evolution-mail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 1303 (evolution-mail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 1306 (evolution-mail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 1307 (evolution-mail).
now, i dont know if the load average spiking was evolution's fault, or
not...but everything seemed to work. Good job.
