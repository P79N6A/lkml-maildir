Hi John,
Hmm.. it seems that the ide-tape driver is broken for some people
in current kernels. Byron reported the same behavior.
In ide.c we are checking that every access is in a valid range. We used
to initialize the range according to the partition table for disk and
floppy drives, and initialize it to a very big values for tape and cdrom,
effectively bypassing the check for those media types.
Current kernels initialize the boundary of the check only for media of
type disk or type floppy; in a tape or cdrom media (or floppy under
ide-scsi), the field will be uninitialized, with unexpected results (it
will work for some users and won't for others).
Does the following patch fix it? It will check for "bad access" only
for ide-disk/ide-floppy media, and only when the command is an external
READ/WRITE command (from ll_rw_blk.c) rather than an internal command
(from ide-tape/ide-scsi/etc).
Cheers,
Gadi
