I've uploaded the remaining pending v4l/dvb -stable patches for both 2.6.18.y
and 2.6.19.y to the following locations:
http://linuxtv.org/~mkrufky/stable/2.6.18.y/
 (8 patches)
and
http://linuxtv.org/~mkrufky/stable/2.6.19.y/
 (5 patches)
Using the mailer at my current location, I am unable to send patches inline, and
I won't have the time for it this evening.  In the interest of saving time, I
figured that sending them to you in this method is good enough.  If you still
need for me to send them via email inline, please let me know.
Best Regards,
Michael Krufky
