Indeed. This can be improved though, with some serious work. The poll(2)
and epoll caller supply events he is interested in. We could have
poll_wait() (and f_op->poll()) to accept an events parameter so that the
f_op->poll() code can drop inside separate wait queue depending on what
the caller is waiting for.
