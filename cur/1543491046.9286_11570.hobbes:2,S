I have one IDE disk:
/dev/hda1: ext2, root
/dev/hda2: swapspace
if I run the following commands, the filesystem becomes unusable:
# swapoff /dev/hda2
# swapon /dev/hda1		#<<< NOT A TYPO, really /dev/hda1
The second call does fails, but afterwards ll_rw_block printk()'s:
"device /dev/hda1: only 4096-char blocks implemented (1024)".
I must reboot and fsck afterwards, even SysRq doesn't sync/unmount.
Could someone check that this really crashes Linux?
(2.2.4, no special patches.)
I currently don't have enough time to fix this myself.
Please CC, I'm not on the mailing list.
