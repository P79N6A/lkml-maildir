While talking about AMT ...
<ad>
While talking about AMT:  One quite useful thing is AMT provides is
*remote* management (most useful for kernel hackers: serial-over-lan
console, remote reset).  I've hacked up some tools to use this stuff.
Package is is called amtterm.
Source code: 
http://dl.bytesex.org/releases/amtterm/
Fedora 7+8 have ready-to-go packages in the repositories, so you can
just "yum install amtterm".
SuSE packages are in the buildservice:
