Thank you very much for your reply, Len.
I will also have an FPGA (I think it will be on port 0x1400 or so). I
am writing to LPC using 'outb' like this: outb (data, port);
So I see an I/O write on the LPC bus, that is: 2 bytes for address and
1 byte for data (it tooks one microsecond per transfer).
To speed up things, I wish to transmit more than 1 byte for data in
each transfer (if possible).
Accordingly with page 194 of the sc1200 processor data book, it is
also possible to do a "Bus Master Memory Write" to transmit 1,2 or 4
bytes.
Do you know how can I make a "Bus Master Memory Write" to the LPC?
Thank you very much, regards!
Carlos
