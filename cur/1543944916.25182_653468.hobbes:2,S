correct. There's also a new CONFIG_X86_PTDUMP=y pagetable dumping debug 
feature now in x86.git#mm that produces much nicer output.
Arjan: i it might be nice to make the new pagetable dumper triggerable 
from a SysRq - could you try the kernel/time/timer_list.c's SEQ_printf() 
trick to make the dumping dual-purpose? [so that it printk()'s if it 
should dump to the console and seq_printf()'s if it should dump via 
/proc]
