The percpu areas need to be allocated in a NUMA aware fashion. Otherwise 
you use distant memory for the most performance sensitive areas. The NUMA 
subsystem must be so far up that these allocations can be performed in the 
right way. And this means at least you need to know on which node each 
processor is located. That is what the PDA is currently used for and i386 
has no other way of doing that. I think we could use an array [NR_CPUS] 
for this one but we want to avoid these arrays because NR_CPUS may get 
very big.
