You're right.  I haven't examined the 2.6 stack as closely as the 2.4. 
I noticed the buffer in 2.6 pl2303, but didn't check 2.6 usb-serial.  I
think I prefer the buffer in usb-serial, because its centralised rather
than in each driver, but I'm not going to step up to the plate and
propose changing that!

My understanding of the problem has developed over the last couple of
days; going from wrist-deep to elbow-deep into the guts of things does
that.  There is a problem, and the solution I've been developing
addresses it, but maybe there's a simpler answer.  Hope to have a patch
together soon.
