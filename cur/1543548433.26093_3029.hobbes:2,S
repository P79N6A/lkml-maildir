I used to work on kdb in my own time, for free.  Then I joined SGI and
now I get paid to work on it.  If I left SGI I would continue to work
on kdb, the original kdb developer left SGI but still contributes.

That Linus does not like kernel debuggers.  This is news?  There are
several examples of code that Linus did not like originally but enough
people wanted them and they eventually got included in the kernel.
Complaining to Linus does nothing, "show me the code".

kdb is not a hacked in after thought.  It was designed from scratch as
a minimalist kernel debugger which coexists with the existing kernel
design.  Note "minimalist", adding kdb to a kernel has little effect on
the running kernel, the biggest impact is the symbol table (adds 20-30%
to loaded kernel size) and the last branch recording in the page fault
handler which probably slows page faulting slightly, although I have
not measured it.
kdb does a reasonable job at the binary level which is exactly what it
was designed to do.  If you have to change the kernel design to
incorporate a debugger then you seriously need to think if your
debugger design is suitable.

In exactly the same position as every other kernel developer.  Nobody
promised us that kernel APIs would remain stable in development
kernels, if it breaks we fix it in the next patch.  This is the Linux
development model, everyone else lives with it.
