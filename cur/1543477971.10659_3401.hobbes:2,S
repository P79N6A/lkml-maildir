Sorry, I did not state clearly what I meant. By error I meant either an
off by one in Neil's understanding of the code or a behaviour which does
not correspond with the idea of the scheduler author. 
Nevertheless, I think that around 9% of CPU for a maximally niced process
is still too high. Basically this 'off by one' thing decreases the dynamic
range in priority adjustment by a factor of 2 which is not negligible
IMHO. But it depends mostly on how it scales with several niced processes,
will 4 number-crunching niced processes take 8/29 ~= 28% of CPU time (on
an UP box) ?

P.S: while wrinting a patch by Ingo came along which at leasts makes the
comments consistent with the implementation. That's at the very least 
what I liked to see.
