This is correct. For now, the kernel does not report the
existance of new-style threads. I intend to deal with this
problem during the coming week.
I could use a bit of help with research. If you have access
to a non-Linux system, please let me know how the native ps
and top programs handle threads. I do know that many non-Linux
implementations will group threads together in ps output.
Ways to display all threads include:
ps -m   (Tru64, AIX)
ps m    (Tru64, AIX)
ps -T   (IRIX)
ps -L   (Solaris, UnixWare)
ps H    (FreeBSD)
ps k    (OpenBSD)
ps s    (NetBSD)
Examples:
AIX:     ps -eo pid,thcount,tid,comm
Solaris: ps -eLf
Tru64:   ps -emO THREAD
Please use procps-feedback@lists.sf.net for this data.
Here's a program you can use for testing; you may need
to compile it as "cc foo.c -lpthread".
