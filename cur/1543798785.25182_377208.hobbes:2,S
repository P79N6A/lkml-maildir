In the context of implementing mutex they most likely are. But not
generally: LL/SC fails when _any_ write was made into monitored
location, whereas CAS fails only when value stored in that location
changes. As a result, CAS has to deal with "ABA problem" when value
(e.g., first element in a queue) is changed from A to B (head of the
queue is removed) and then back to A (old head is inserted back).
