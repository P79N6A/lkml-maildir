Who says that the embedded system has to do that in his own memory? You
need a server from which you get the data and store it back. That server
can also do that work for the embedded system. You already need to hack a
script or so for doing the work, why not hack a "client server" solution
in which the embedded system tells the server what has to be done. The
Server should enough memory and storage place for including all things
necessary. (To be continued...)
IMHO here is somebody "inventing" a problem where no one is.
