Free- and OpenBSD have it too.  For Solaris I've found a feature request
only.  Dunno about MacOS/Darwin.  Other un*xes which are important these
days?
I'd *really* hate it to have the same system call with different
argument ordering on different systems though.  Especially when swapping
two integer values, so gcc wouldn't error out on wrong usage.
cheers,
