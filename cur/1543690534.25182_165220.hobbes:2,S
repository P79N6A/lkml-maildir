That's a mistake of mine: it's defined in
include/asm-sh/sh*/shmparam.h and I didn't look there.
Userland: I'm reading the Glibc 2.3.1 source and I'm not sure if it
defines suitable SHMLBA for SH4.  There's no file in the Glibc tree,
but maybe the SH installation of Glibc includes the kernel header?
