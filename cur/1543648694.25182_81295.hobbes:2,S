Just before Alan says it :-)
There have been 4 errata kernels released for RH 7.3 so far, so you
really ought to upgrade to the latest of those for starters. Obviously,
your problem may not be easily reproducible, but if you _could_
reproduce it on the latest kernel, I think people would take a higher
level of interest! Just my advice....
Cheers
