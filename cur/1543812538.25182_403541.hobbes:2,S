Thank you very much Jon. But I think I haven´t explained very well.
I know that now the prio_array and runqueues structs aren´t accesible 
for modules, but in the 2.6.5 version they were. I would like to know 
the reason, why before they were accesible and now they don´t? If you 
could answer me, it would be great. I could to write the reason in my 
university job. (In Spain we have to make a final degree job, and mine 
is about modules in linux (I chose this), I would like to show 
information of the new scheduler, a scheduler monitor, and these fields 
are indispensable for me)
I thought in your solution (own kernel tree), but I would like to make a 
module that worked in standard distributions. I prefer to make a module 
that worked in 2.6.5 version instead to make one that worked in 2.6.12 
but with my own kernel tree. So I suposse that I will do that, but 
knowing the reason why could serve me to make a better investigation 
document.
Thank you again for your help, I will mention you in my final degree job 
acknowledge. Please, keep helping me!!! :)
