I ran this test.  This is a read test.  What I did below was a write test.
Additionally, I ran this test:
     time dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1024k count=1024
 From that, I got 47 megs/sec.  From 'hdparm -t /dev/sda', I got a 
slightly lower number.
So, for reads, I'm getting good performance.  47 megs/sec at the 
outer-most tracks is a bit lower than the 50+ that reviewers report, but 
it's not bad.
However, I don't get anywhere near the 40+ megs/sec the reviewers say 
the drive gets for writes.  That model as a single drive in my wife's 
computer gets about 39 megs/sec, which is great.  But behind the 3ware, 
the drive gets only 13 megs/sec.  (iozone reports about 15 megs/sec, but 
that's influenced by caching in RAM, and iozone is writing to a file on 
tracks further out, I think.)
