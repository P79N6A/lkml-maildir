I think I'm hitting a similar problem to the one Paul describes. We have
code in our test framework that does:
alarm(1)
do some test that should complete almost immediately (i.e. not block)
a = alarm(0)
check that a == 1
On Linux 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, and a whole range of Unix-alikes, a = 1. On Linux
2.5.75-mm1, a=2. This does suggest that the behaviour of 2.5 is wrong...
Minimal test program:
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main( int argc, char **argv )
{
   int left;
   alarm( 1 );
   left = alarm( 0 );
   printf( "%d\n", left );
   return 0;
}
Regards,
Ben
