Hi,
I noticed my web server reboot while doing an rsync because the load was
too high (and my watchdog decided that something was wrong...).
The CPU was mostly idle but /proc/loadavg showed a load average of over
40.
I assume that the iowait is also used for the load average calculation.
Every process that's waiting for IO contributes a load average of one.
Right?
So rsync kept the disk busy and a lot of mail and apache processes were
waiting for it.
Is this the desired behavior or wrong?
