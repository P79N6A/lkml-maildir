yep, you are right. Dmitry Adamushko and Balbir Singh are working on 
this area, and my tree already contains the fixes for rt task's 
exec_start. (this also gives us the ability to have precise 'top' 
statistics for RT tasks.) So this should be fixed in -v16. (Since it's 
quite uncommon for a task to drop in and out of scheduling classes, this 
problem was found via review, not via any user-visible regression.)

yep - the 'fair clock' in essence freezes when RT tasks are running (but 
not completely). Can you think of any bad effect from this perhaps? It's 
useful to have unified load-balancing (smpnice-driven) between the RT 
and fair classes.
