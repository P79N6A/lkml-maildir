There is one more piece to consider with either approach.  The
calling conventions.
With the x86-64 optimized vsyscall the syscall number does
not need to be placed into a register, because you have used
the proper entry point.  For any syscall worth tuning in
user space I suspect that level of optimization would be
beneficial.  A fast call path that does not waste a register.
