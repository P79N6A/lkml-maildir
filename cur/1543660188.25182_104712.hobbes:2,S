Hello all,
I have a Promise FastTrack 100 TX2 (PDC20268) IDE-controller
(BIOS v2.00.0.24) used in a linux MD-RAID.  Aside from various
other annoying Promise-problems, I am not able to perform a
remote boot because the brain-dead Promise-BIOS "complains" that
no array is defined, and requires one to press ESC to continue
booting.  I would very much appreciate any tips as to how I can
circumvent this "feature".
Best regards,
Robert
