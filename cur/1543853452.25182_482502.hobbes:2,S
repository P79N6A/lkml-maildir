Subject: [PATCH 19/28] readahead: initial method
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Aggressive readahead policy for read on start-of-file.
Instead of selecting a conservative readahead size,
it tries to do large readahead in the first place.
However we have to watch on two cases:
	- do not ruin the hit rate for file-head-checkers
	- do not lead to thrashing for memory tight systems
In most cases, the threat of file-head-peakers is neglectable. So a simple
user tunable parameter is used. Users can try a larger initial read-ahead
size:
	echo 128 > /sys/block/sda/queue/initial_ra_kb
It benefits the many-small-files case:
adaptive readahead: avg 10.3 seconds
====================================
stock readahead: avg 12.3 seconds
=================================
The rxvt-unicode-7.7 being benchmarked is a dir with many .C/.h/.o files.
