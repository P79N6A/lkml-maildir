No, this is not true.  If you add a new controller (for some new disks in 
a new external enclosure or whatever), and that controller uses the same 
driver as other controller(s) in your system, then you have no guarantee 
of order.  For example, adding a 4th aic7xxx controller to your system 
might or might not place the new controller at the end of the list 
depending on PCI scan order, etc.  There simply is *no* guarantee here of 
any consistent naming, so don't bother trying to claim there is.
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the patch isn't usefull, but the 
patch doesn't provide *any* guarantee of consistent device naming and so 
using that as a reason to put the patch into the mainstream kernel is 
utter crap.  Go ahead and make your case for why it should be in the 
kernel, but don't use reasons that aren't correct.

This can be done without your patch (the mapping from /dev/sg to /dev/sd? 
or /dev/st? or /dev/scd? or whatever is not impossible from user space 
without your patch, it just requires a user space tool to open the files 
and start comparing host/bus/id/lun combinations from dev file to dev 
file).

This part is true enough, it is easier to read the map file than to 
program the information retrieval I mentioned above.

This I don't think is usefull at all.  It's no more reliable than our 
current system and people that are depending on this to solve their "I 
can't tell what device is what" delima are going to be sorely upset when 
they realize that hardware changes can change this stuff around just as 
fast as it changes around the /dev/sd? mappings.
> The latter one is enough for many setups,
The latter one is just as broken in design as the original /dev/sd? 
enumeration problem (which stands to reason since this method also is an 
enumeration method, it's just that instead of enumerating the disks 
starting at 0, we are enumerating the SCSI controllers starting at the 
first one we find and going from there).

Which is the much better way to go.
