It's easy to explain: Your sample code had a tdr[] array in the thread's
hw_breakpoint area and my patch did not; adding it amounts to moving some
of the data from the CPU's info into the thread's info.

That's basically what I intend to do.  Although instead of keeping track 
of an active_dr7, I'll keep track of num_kbps as of the last time the 
thread ran.  The unlikely case can be triggered by setting the value to 
-1.

With my scheme it won't matter.  You'll see.

No, I'm not confused and neither are you.  I realize there's no functional 
difference between the two sets of enable bits, since Linux doesn't use 
hardware task-switching.  I just like to keep things neatly separated, 
that's all.

I haven't checked the ioperm code to be certain, but it seems like the 
sort of thing somebody might want to do on occasion.
Another aspect perhaps worth mentioning is that user breakpoints are 
active only when the task is running.  Hence breakpoints for user data 
affected by AIO operations won't necessarily be triggered; with async I/O 
the transfers can occur while a different task is running.  Of course 
there's nothing new about this; the same has been true for ptrace all 
along.

I will endeavor to optimize switch_to_thread_hw_breakpoint.  However it 
will turn out that the hot patch really does to use chbi->num_kbps and 
chbi->kdr7_mask.  Again, you'll see...

You're right; I'll do it that way.

Okay, I'll check the address bits.

Not if you have interrupts disabled.  Debug register settings are 
disseminated from one CPU to the others by means of an IPI.
