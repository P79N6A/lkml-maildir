Possibly you already tried this, then ignore my ideas:
First idea:
It might be a stupid idea, as I don´t know your Toshiba but try to change the 
PnP OS option in the BIOS. (from yes to no or from no to yes)
If you don´t have success set it back, of course.
Second idea:
Have you activated ISA PnP in the Kernel?
/proc/isapnp must exist and the sound module should be loaded after the 
isaPnP support. 
If /proc/isapnp exists, what is sndconfig doing?
Good Luck.
