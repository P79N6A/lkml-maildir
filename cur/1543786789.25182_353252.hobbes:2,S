I think it's because with the numerous changes we brought, the '>' test
became '>=' but the old timeout was still used with '>'. With '>=', I
agree with you that it must be -999.
Andrew, Vadim is right. Anyway, this proves why we must really move all
those complicated tests to jiffies.h ASAP !
BTW, Andrew, could you merge the jiffies fix before -mm3, so that we can
remove those annoying tests quickly ?
Thanks in advance,
Willy
