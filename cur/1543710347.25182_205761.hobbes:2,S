Andi, I'll agree that the way domains currently get set up is pretty
ugly. Maybe some additional functions or macros could be used to make
this process a bit clearer.
The actual kernel/sched.c code is really not that complex. In some ways
it is *less* complicated than the old numa scheduler because it all goes
through one code path.
It also handles SMT, which is where a bit of complexity is coming from.
The other alternative is shared runqueues which is uglier and less flexible.

There have been a few changes and bug fixes since you last tested.
Maybe that would help.

Yep shared runqueues. Ingo and Rusty both had implementations but
they both agreed sched-domains was a better alternative.
