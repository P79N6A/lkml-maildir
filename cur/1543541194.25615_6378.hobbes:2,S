have you checked this with recent kernels?  In response to a patch sent
by me to linuxppc-dev, someone (planb maintainer?) said PPC was now
working in this regard.  Thanks for pointing out this issue, I'm very
interested in getting a definite answer on this point.

Posting to the list doesn't imply that a patch will be included by Linus
necessarily, and we are 100% agreed that all patches need to be sent to
driver maintainers.  I disagree that patches should be hidden from the
list when they include obvious fixes, though, and I don't see anything
wrong with a public review of a patch.  Reviews tend to help people
learn the kernel interfaces, both the patch author and general lkml
audience.
And though appearances are sometimes to the contrary, I don't claim to
be the maintainer of the net drivers.  DaveM, Alexey, and the others are
far more influential in the actual design.  In addition to maintaining a
few drivers, I mainly play the role of the kernel janitor, sweeping out
some of the bitrot now and again.. :)
