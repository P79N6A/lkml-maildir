I have the same chip on my motherboard and I have found that doing an
'ifconfig down' followed by 'ifconfig up' will make the chip work.
(You may need to restore the default route after doing the above.
Or, if you have an appropriate initscript in /etc/rc.d or /etc/init.d
you can just use it to restart the network -- same idea but less trouble.)
BTW, how do can you tell that the media choice is wrong?  'ifconfig' doesn't
give me that information.
