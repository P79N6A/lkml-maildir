Hello all,
	I am new at this so bare with me...
	Inside /usr/include/linux/netdevice.h, there is a 
	#define for MAX_ADDR_LEN which is currently set to
	a value of "7" in 2.4. I am working on an implementation
	where the hardware address of the media needs be larger
	than 7 bytes. What is the process by which I would have
	to go through to get this value changed to something larger
	than 7 bytes, if I so desired ?
Thanks,
Joe Golio
