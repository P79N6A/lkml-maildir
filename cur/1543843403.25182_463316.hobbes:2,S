Yes; that's what my previous post was about.  See
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/12/300
I was doing 2.6.17.11, which was kernel.org's latest stable at the
time I started all this.
I tried the Debian kernels just to show that it wasn't just me
screwing up my kernel configs.
These machines will not boot an any kernel > 2.6.3 that I have
tried, and I've tried about 8 different ones at this point.
I noted in the release notes for 2.6.4 that the mce code was
entirely replaced; I'm suspecting that's the problem, but I have no
idea how to debug it.  Whether the problem is the kernel or the
motherboard is also certainly open to debate.
