It isn't minors that shouldn't change, it is the mapping of the 
filesystem device node to those minors.  This can be achieved by 
properly managing device naming in userspace automatically on partition 
updates, instead of using static naming such as /dev/sda which already 
has significant problems when devices are removed/inserted in hotswap 
environments.
The fact that minors change is irrelevant if proper steps are taken to 
ensure that those minors always map to the correct named device in user 
space.
