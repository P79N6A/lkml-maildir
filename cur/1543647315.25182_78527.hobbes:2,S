This opened my eyes, thanks for all your help and patience!!!
The problem is that the load balancer is called before the CPU pools
were set up. That's fine, I thought, because I define in sched_init
the default pool 0 to include all CPUs. But: in find_busiest_queue()
the cpu_to_node(this_cpu) delivers a non-zero pool which is not set up
yet, therefore pool_nr_cpus[pool]=0 and we get a zero divide.
I'm still wondering why this doesn't happen on our architecture. Maybe
the interrupts are disabled longer, I'll check. Anyway, a fix is to
force this_pool to be 0 as long as numpools=1. The attached patch is a
quick untested hack, maybe one can do it better. Has to be applied on top
of the other 2.
Going to sleep now...
Bye,
Erich
