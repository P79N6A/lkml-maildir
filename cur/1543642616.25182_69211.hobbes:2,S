Accuracy is not very important in that sysctl_overcommit_memory 0 case
e.g. the swapper_space.nr_pages addition was brought in at a time when
it was very necessary, but usually overestimates now (or last time I
thought about it).  The main thing to look out for is running the same
memory grabber twice in quick succession: not nice if it succeeds the
first time, but not the second, just because of some transient effect
that its old pages are temporarily uncounted.
