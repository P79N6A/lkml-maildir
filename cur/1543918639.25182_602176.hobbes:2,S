Right you are, silly me. But yes, it works for me even with that (and 
since I downloaded the gcc source tree, it now has six more megs of 
arguments).
I also tested that "ulimit -s" seems to do the right thing for me.
I'm also assuming Mathieu is running x86 (or x86-64): HP-PA has a stack 
that grows upwards, and that has traditionally been exciting.
IA64 also has some strange things for the register backing store.
