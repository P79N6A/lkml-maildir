Subject: eepro100.c bug on 10Mbit half duplex (kernels 2.4.5 / 2.4.10 / 2.4.11pre6 / 2.4.11 / 2.4.10ac11)

Hi all,
I can confirm that the known bug in the Intel EtherExpress Pro/100
adapter is still not worked around in recent kernels. The bug only
manifests itself when the card is operating on 10 Mbit half duplex. On
100 Mbit there are no problems. The problem is that after the device
received certain amount of traffic (between 80 and 130 Mb in my tests)
the device will lockup on new connections. Processes start to hang after
this and logging in is impossible. The only solution is to reset the
interface (using a previously logged in root session) and reboot the
system.
This is tested on :
Linus kernels:
	- 2.4.5
	- 2.4.10-pre2
	- 2.4.10
	- 2.4.11pre6
	- 2.4.11
	- 2.4.11 with eepro100.c from ac kernel 2.4.10ac11 (minor diffs)
Again, on 100 Mbit there are no more problems.
This is my relevant dmesg output:
