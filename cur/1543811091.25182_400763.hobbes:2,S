The notion was that having a fixed virtual mapping of the kernel would 
allow it to be loaded anywhere physically without needing to do actual 
address fixups. The bootloader could then for example at runtime decide 
to load the kernel at 16MB if the machine had enough memory available, 
to free up ZONE_DMA. Or not do that if running on a <= 16MB machine.
Or the kdump "host" kernel would make that decission, as it seems the 
want is shared with them. Eric Biederman said that fixups aren't that 
bad though...
