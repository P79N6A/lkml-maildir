I've noticed that if I remove usb-storage and reinsert it, insmod will go
into D state and usb-storage will not work.  At this point, I can't shut
down the system normally since the shutdown will hang.
Is this a known problem?  The system is a supermicro X5DA8 board (E7505
Chipset).  I've had this problem with all 2.6 kernels.
