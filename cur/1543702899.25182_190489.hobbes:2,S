It may not be the specific problem that you have now, but it is a
problem in general.  The size of /proc/kcore may be a good
approximation for the amount of memory on machines that have
contiguous physical memory starting at a base physical address
of 0x0, but on an increasing number of machines it may give
a grossly inflated value (perhaps an SGI Altix user will post
the output from "ls -l /proc/kcore").
