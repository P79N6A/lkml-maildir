Well, I don't know if this can be somehow related to a bug in the driver, but on
my system, after I've unplugged the USB trasnsitter, ksoftirqd/0 begin to use
89% of my CPU time (top). I suspect that there are some issue that should be
fixed somewhere.

Well, actually my 2.6.29 copy seems to be broken:
arch/x86/kernel/amd_iommu.o: In function `debugfs_create_size_t':
amd_iommu.c:(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `debugfs_create_size_t'
arch/x86/kernel/kdebugfs.o:kdebugfs.c:(.text+0x0): first defined here
make[1]: *** [arch/x86/kernel/built-in.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/x86/kernel] Error 2

I don't know too much how to use git to do what you're asking. I've some years
of experience with svn and cvs but git is quite a new tool for me.
I'll wait a git kernel that compile while I'll try to find out how to do what
you're asking.
I have not so much free time to spend in a checkout / build / test if the test
phase need a kernel reinstall / system reboot. If it's only the driver module I
think I can try to test it for each changeset in a couple of weeks /starting
from the day I know how to bisect :-) ).
