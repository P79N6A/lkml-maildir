If you send a 100 ACKs you won't get this behavior.
Once you give more ACKs than the other end has packets
to send (or more than the congestion window can fit)
the sender just waits for a timer based timeout before
it retransmits more data.
So what you code causes to happen is after the first data segment
is sent, you crazily spit out 100 ACKs, the send has a tiny
congestion window (now 2 segments) so at most it can send 2
packets back in response to all of those ACKs.
