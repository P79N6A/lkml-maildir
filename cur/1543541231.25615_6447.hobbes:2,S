you keep repeating this misinformation, so I think it's worth correcting
you.
2.3.99pre1 : Tue Mar 14
2.4.0-test1: Thu May 25
(and Linus promptly went on holiday, so it may be more fair to start
counting 2.4.0-test from 2.4.0-test2: Fri Jun 23).
On Monday August 9th, 1999 -- one year ago today -- Linus released
2.3.13.  that's a lot of revisions from .51 which was the final 2.3
before 2.3.99-pre.
