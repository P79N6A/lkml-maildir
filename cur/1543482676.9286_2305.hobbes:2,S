If you ping the network address, you will get a response from every
host on your local network! This is correct. Some versions of ping
prevent you pinging the network address or a broadcast address.

[SNIPPED hundreds of responses]
FYI, SNMP (Simplified network management protocol) programs often
find the machines that are alive on the local network by doing this.
M$CRAP machines ARP every possible machine, rather than sending
one ICMP request and sorting the answers, which makes M$CRAP a
bad network neighbor.
