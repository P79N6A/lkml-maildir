Damnit!  I had somehow missed the announcements when searching for it.  Argh, time for yet another name change. ;-)

What do you mean by "we are not there yet?"  I thought the point of this exercise was to get us there! ;-)

Allocation and freeing can be done in the read_inode, put_inode pairs.  The extra data that a filesystem needs is persistent for the lifetime of the inode in the icache, unless a filesystem wished to do otherwise.
What do you mean exactly by an init_once type animal?  If anything, read_inode() certainly seems to fall under that category.

Good point about knfsd.  I never really looked at it or compatability issues with my FS.  What a horrible idea from the point of view of keeping a good layer of abstraction.  The easiest answer is that knfsd passes NULL, and if a filesystem requires the additional cookie, then it doesn't work with knfsd.  We should probably have a flag (FS_REQUIRES_COOKIE -- the cookie monster flag? ;-) in the fs_flags so it doesn't try to export it.  Wow, talk about spagetti code...
So i guess the goal of the changes was to make NFS work super-fast, at the expense of extensibility?  (Not meant sarcastically, it's a real question.)

Not neccicarily a re-read, but possibly a transaction context, or to do a revalidation if the filesystem is acting as a cache, and generally let the fs know that it has one more refferer.

Not really.  Yes, the x86 is register starved, but my experience with using 64 bits in the kernel is that the overhead isn't too bad as long as you stick to adds and shifts, which is all most fileystems need anyway.  Is it also the case that someone has gotten MMX working in the kernel (i believe in the RAID checksumming/parity code)?  Using that, we could get '1/2 cycle' 64 bit math + 8 extra registers on the Pentium MMX and on.  Not to mention, the benifits of having truly 64-bit filesystems supported without big kludges would be nice for moving linux into the HA/Data Center area.  The only problem is that the code would probably have __add_u64(a, b) rather than a+b, and have to add prefix and suffix code around alot of the icache functions.  (Or beware the great no emms penalty...)  Is it also generally assumend by the compiler that any function call can trash FPU state, yes?  (The only problem with this that i can see...) 
The dissapearance of the BITS_PER_LONG < 64 ifdef's in my code would be nice also... ;-)
