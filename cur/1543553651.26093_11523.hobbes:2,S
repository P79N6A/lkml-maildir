Well we don't have auto unload.
And module persistent data for the second load case causes chaos with 
the goal of having exactly the same code in modules and compiled in
kernel code.
It would probably be better (in this case) to increment the module count
when the mixer settings go above 0, and decrement it when the settings 
go totally to 0.  This prevents an unwanted unload.
But for reliability and code simplicity there does not yet seem to
be a case for persistent module storage.
