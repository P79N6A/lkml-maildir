Donald's development is not open AT ALL.  Read Donald's own description
of how he developed the 2.3 network drivers and interface (pci-netif). 
He disappears for many months, creates a design without interfacing with
kernel developers, and then appears again with a code drop.
It is classic cathedral style of development.  Read Eric Raymond's paper
on why the bazaar method is far, far superior.  The Linux kernel is the
bazaar method, and this is the central conflict which forced the kernel
and Donald drivers to diverge.
Yes, the end result of Donald's work is open source, but his development
is not open at all.  And therein lies the problem [which existed far
longer than I have been hacking on the net drivers...]
