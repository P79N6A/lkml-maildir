This patch is needed for all buggy BIOSes that don't correctly set up MCFG.

No, as you stated yourself there are two exceptions. And the more serious one is the
BIOS issue.

Not sure why you assume extended config space (ECS) is not critical.
Ok, for a lot of stuff it does not matter.
But it is needed for some devices for full functionality.
E.g. for perfmon (family 0x10/extended inerrupts) extended config space access
is a prerequisite.

Rely on something unreliable (due to buggy/incomplete BIOS)?
I don't think we should do this.
IMHO it is best to try to use MMCONFIG if it's working and to use
a fallback (e.g. CF8 ECS access for family 0x10) if available.
