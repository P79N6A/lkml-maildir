Doing mkfs in-kernel is unusual.  I don't think the above description
sufficiently helps the uninitiated understand why mkfs cannot be done
in userspace as usual.  Please flesh it out a bit.
What are the dependencies for this filesystem code?  I assume that it
depends on various block- and scsi-level patches?  Which ones, and
what is their status, and is this code even compileable without them?
Thanks.
