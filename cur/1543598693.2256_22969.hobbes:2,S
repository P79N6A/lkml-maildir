Depends on who's interpreting the license.  I say as long as the source to
the whole mess is available (even provided *with* the binaries), you aren't
violating anything.  On the otherhand, strictly speaking, once the file
is compiled, it becomes "in binary form" which needs the notice attached to
it in some way -- like all the fine print one finds on any box of stuff from
Sun, Compaq/Digital, Cisco, etc.
However, as others have said, none of us are lawyers.  Of course, none of us
have been sued by Qlogic either.
