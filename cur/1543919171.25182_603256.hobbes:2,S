There is no such thing as bit-order. The data lines are numbered,
say, D0 - D31, with D0 being LSB (bit) and D31 MSB.
You usually write register bits from MSB to LSB, so shift left
increments and shift right decrements the value. This is orthogonal
to the big/little-endianness.
Now your device can be connected straight to the bus or the data
lanes (4 on 32-bit PCI) can be crossed. This is platform-dependent.
The kernel provides functions/macros to access devices in
a independent way, such as writel/readl/pci_map_* etc.
