Hi,
In a somewhat desperate attempt to get a recent 2.2.x kernel to not keep
effectively hanging up under very high network and CPU load I tried putting the
lastest version of the eepro100 driver (1.09l) into my stock 2.2.12 kernel. 
This seems to have fixed at least some of the problems.  I can no longer easily
generate "transmitter timeouts" that have been causing major headaches, and
causing machines to fall off the parallel cluster.
However, I am somewhat baffled as to why the driver version shipped with 2.2.12
is so much older than the latest one (about 8 months or so old I think).  Is
there any reason for this?
Mark
