	Hi, folks,
	just a random thought on sync drivers: I would like to have
the common way of reading the status of modem lines (or at least DCD)
on a synchronous port. On many HW routers (read: Cis*o) you can
distinguish between the line (DCD) coming down (modem problem, or physical
line problem) and the non-existent link protocol (remote end is not
connected or is down, clock problem etc).
	In general, I would like to see the mechanism of asynchronous
notification about problems (which can be turned into SNMP traps easily)
on the sync serial line. I am just not sure about the interface itself.
