Not workable. We would also nead coffcap, javacap, scriptcap, etc. We really
need to store the capabilities in the filesystem(s).
Storing three capability sets per executable on the filesystem gives us all we
need:
- It defined the least capabilities a process gets after exec (What some seem to
call the ``forced'' set of capabilities).
- It defines which capabilities may be inherited from the parent process.
- It also defines the effective capabilities.
This means that we can even get around making some apps capability aware (they
simply get a reduced set of capabilities from exec).
