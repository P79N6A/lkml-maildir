Media errors are reported for writes when the drive knows there are
problems. That may be deferred to the cache flush afterwards but the
information is still generated and shipped back to us - eventually.

CRC errors, lost IRQs and the like are retried by the midlayer and
drivers and the error handling strategies will also try things like
reducing link speeds on repeated CRC errors.
