Hello, Rusty,
Good stuff!  A few comments, as always!
						Thanx, Paul
Glossary:
o	Hardware Interrupt / Hardware IRQ: How does in_irq()
	know that interrupts have been blocked?  The local_irq_disable()
	does not seem to mess with the counter, and preempt_disable()
	just does the standard inc/dec stuff...
	o	in_irq() is hardirq_count().
	o	hardirq_count() is (preempt_count() & HARDIRQ_MASK).
	o	preempt_count is an integer, HARDIRQ_MASK is a constant that
		is out of the normal inc/dec range.
	I see how an interrupt handler causes in_irq() to do its thing
	via the irq_enter() and irq_exit() macros, but I don't see how
	masking interrupts makes this happen.
	Probably just my confusion, but...
	Ditto for "in_interrupt()".  That would be for both the
	analysis and the probable confusion on my part.
o	Software Interrupt / softirq: formatting botch "of'software".
	This would be "o'software", right?
o	Preemption: Would it be worth changing the first bit
	of the second sentence to read something like: "In 2.5.4
	and later, when CONFIG_PREEMPT is set, this changes:"?
Overzealous Prevention Of Deadlocks:  Cute!!!
Avoiding Locks: Read Copy Update
o	Might be worth noting explicitly early on that updaters are
	running concurrently with readers.  Should be obvious given
	that the readers aren't doing any explicit synchronization,
	but I have run into confusion on this point surprisingly often.
o	Please add a note to the list_for_each_entry_rcu() description
	saying that writers (who hold appropriate locks) need not use
	the _rcu() variant.
o	Don't understand the blank line before and after the
	"struct rcu_head rcu;", but clearly doesn't affect
	functionality.  ;-)
o	If nothing blocks between the call to __cache_find() and the
	eventual object_put(), it is worthwhile to avoid the
	reference-count manipulation.  This would make all of
	cache_find() be almost as fast as UP, rather than just
	__cache_find().
