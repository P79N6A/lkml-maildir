hello all,
	i have a disk with ufs on it. the ufstype is "old", although "sun"
also works well when mounting. i compiled kernel 2.2.1 with UFS_FS_WRITE
enabled. when i mount the filesystem, i get a "ufstype=old is supported 
read-only". this is true as i was not able to write anything to the
filesystem. i remounted the filesystem with "-w" ( read-write) and tried
to write to the fs with disasterous results. the process was left in
abeyence. i had to kill the shell to recover. however when doing a
shutdown, immediately afterwards, the kernel hung at the "unmounting
filesystems" stage.
	now, can anyone tell me if there is a <patch, document, lead>
which will be helpful in enabling write support.
				thanks, murali.
