Reiser is not good idea for squid cache. Why ? Squids cache is hashed
by default to minimize "big directory effect". Reiserfs is fast on
realy big directories, but it eat more cpu than ext2. On high loaded
cache servers cpu utilization on reiser can be realy big.
Better way is make more subdirectories in squid cache, and use
filesystem, that eat less of cpu.
