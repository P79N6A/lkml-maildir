   [Otherwise a sender can force us into a permanent quickack mode
   simply by setting PSH on every segment.]
"A sending TCP can send us garbage so bad that it hinders
performance."
So, your point is? :-)  A sensible sending application, and a sensible
TCP should not being setting PSH every single segment.  And we're not
coding up hacks to make the Linux receiver handle this case better.
You'll have much better luck convincing us to implement ECN black hole
workarounds :-)
Franks a lot,
