Subject: [PATCH] M68k ret_from_fork
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

M68k: Revert to 2.4 behavior in ret_from_fork (always call schedule_tail,
regardless of CONFIG_SMP), as suggested by Andreas Schwab.
This removes the warnings from sched.c (from Sam Creasey).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
