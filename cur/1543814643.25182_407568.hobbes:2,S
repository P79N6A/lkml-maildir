Nonsense :-)  These days, it's merely only a bit in PCI config space
that needs a flip.  Since vendors seem more and more to `care' about
their customers to only use one (that is, the newly bought additional
sound card, or even other equipment) I even thought about writing a
little helper program to help finding the correct bit.
Just for the records, it happens actually quite often that some little
features / improvements of a chipset have bugs; from time to time,
you'll see a BIOS update that doesn't really do more than switching
off that feature. I guess that quite some of our quirks originate from
looking at what a newer BIOS configures differently compared to an
older version.  Some instability can be fixed that way (though it's
better to have a fix for such a bug inside the BIOS: this way, the fix
is in place at the time the Linux kernel is loaded, so there's no way
for it to eg. cause memory corruption between loading the kernel and
issueing the quirks.)
