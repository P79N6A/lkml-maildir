yes, I also noticed it immediatly, 250000 buckets vs 8million buckets...
Not only that, now I also noticed it seems there is a different number
of entries into the two hashes.

I won't be really surprised if you can beat the pagecache hash with big
files. Fibonacci/mul may very well be better there. I'm not sure if you
can beat it on the small files though, and still one should always take
into account the cache effects, the monitoring of the hash distribution
isn't the end of the story.
I would be mostly interested to see a comparions for the hashfn of the
wait_table too, that is the thing we were discussing here.
