Andrew, 
	Here's the patch to replace use-pmtmr-for-delay_pmtmr. It simply uses
the TSC for delay_pmtmr much as delay_tsc does.  The only gottcha is
that __delay will be affected by cpu-frequency changes (much as the
existing loop based delay) until I hook in the cpufreq notificaiton into
the ACPI PM timesource code. I'll get to that issue early next week
(sorry, I had a few other things I had to finish today). 
Let me know if this solves the APIC trouble on your system and if so,
I'd be interested to see how it works in -mm. 
thanks
