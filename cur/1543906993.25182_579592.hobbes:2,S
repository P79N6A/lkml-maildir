XFS has never overwritten data on reboot. It leaves holes when the kernel has
failed to write out data. A hole == zeros so XFS does not expose stale data in
this situation. As it is, the underlying XFS problem (lack of synchronisation
between inode size update and data writes has been mostly fixed in 2.6.22 by
only updating the file size to be written to disk on data I/O completion.
FWIW, fsync() would prevent this from happening, but many application writers
seem strangely reluctant to put fsync() calls into code to ensure the data
they write is safely on disk.....
Cheers,
Dave.
