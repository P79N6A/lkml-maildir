Subject: [PATCH] fb: sm501fb off-by-1 sysfs store
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/1/36

Currently sm501fb_crtsrc_store() won't allow the routing to be changed
via echos from userspace in to the sysfs file. The reason for this is
that the strnicmp() for both heads uses a sizeof() for the string length,
which ends up being strlen() + 1 (\0 in the normal case, but the echo
gives a newline, which is where the issue occurs), this then causes a
mismatch and subsequently bails with the -EINVAL.
In addition to this, the hardcoded lengths were then used for the store
length that was returned, which ended up being erroneous and resulting in
a write error. There's also no point in returning anything but the full
length since it will -EINVAL out on a mismatch well before then anyways.
sizeof("string") is great for making sure you have space in your buffer,
but rather less so for string comparisons :-)
