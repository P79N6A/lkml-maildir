True.  I very much like the simplicity of the 9P protocol.  But it's
system independence sometimes makes it fit poorly to the Linux VFS
interface.  I guess you have a wide experience with this :)

Context switch happens from one process to the other, not when
entering/leaving the kernel (which is very efficient).
So it's much more important to reduce the number of round-trips for a
single operation, than multiplexing requests for multiple operations.

Yes, but does that matter?  I'm not sure that it's a good idea
bundling network filesystem functionality together with userspace
filesystem functionality.  Each has it's own set of requirements, and
it's own way of working optimally.
What would people say if ext3 was always mounted locally through NFS,
because the kernel would only provide the NFS filesystem client.
Differentiation of interfaces depending on the "closeness" of the
client to the server makes good sense IMO.  We currently have
in-kernel and across-network.  FUSE adds in-userspace in between those
two.
Sometime these can overlap, but one interface will always be more
optimal (in terms of functionality as well as speed) for a specific
application.

Yes.  I'm not speaking agains v9fs, which I think has a valid niche,
as well as FUSE.
