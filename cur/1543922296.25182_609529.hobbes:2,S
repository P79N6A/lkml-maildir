Well it's really documenting existing behavior.  Unless you're very 
careful, running custom applications, the Intel FB and DRM drivers will 
conflict.  IMO this is a long overdue change, but Dave has some custom 
stuff that requires both drivers so he'd rather not see it go in, so 
I'm fine with dropping this part.
