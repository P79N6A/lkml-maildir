Just like we say things are better/easier for us later.

Typically customers who are not familiar with the linux bits are not doing 
modprobe either...
I don't see how early/late makes the problem easier/worse to debug. No matter 
when you do it - the driver refuses to install (or at least should).

Right - for us - the code handing the hardware differences is easier in the 
drivers, rather than the bootloaders.
For other systems - where you can have a UART on any pin - I completely 
understand your point.

You did - I was just saying that some of our customers don't do it the way you 
were thinking.

But this is how it _always_ works on Blackfin. For other systems - like ARM, 
where n+1 silicon manufactures are all implementing things differently - I 
can understand your comments.

I agree - things can always be more descriptive.

with the kernel .config - that is what happens. If you have 2 serial drivers 
connected - you enable 2 serial drivers in Kconfig.

When hardware handshaking pins are fixed - it sure is. When they are not (when 
the hardware doesn't support hardware handshaking, and you need to do it in 
software) - we still allow you do to it via Kconfig.
linux-2.6.x/drivers/serial/Kconfig:
config UART0_CTS_PIN
        int "UART0 CTS pin"
        depends on BFIN_UART0_CTSRTS
        default 23
        help
          The default pin is GPIO_GP7.
          Refer to ./include/asm-blackfin/gpio.h to see the GPIO map.
config UART0_RTS_PIN
        int "UART0 RTS pin"
        depends on BFIN_UART0_CTSRTS
        default 22
        help
          The default pin is GPIO_GP6.
          Refer to ./include/asm-blackfin/gpio.h to see the GPIO map.
Board configs are in one place - under source control - the kernel .config

I wish some of our customers where as good as my aunt Tilly when it comes to 
kernel config, or could remember as well as she can.
I guess we thought it was easier for people to select a few things in config, 
rather than have to write C code/include files for board specific 
implementations options - It is like you said - everything is all in one 
place...
