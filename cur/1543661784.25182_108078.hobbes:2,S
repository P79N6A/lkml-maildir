I did some changes in page_alloc.c
crit_free(struct page *page,unsigned int order)
{
 zone_t *zone;
 unsigned long free,low;
 
 zone = page_zone(page);
 free = zone->free_pages;
 low = zone->pages_low;
 if((free = low)) 
 __free_pages(page,order)
 
 return page;
}
I called this in onde part of page_alloc.c and during boot i received that 
error.
What can be wrong ?
Thanks
Breno
