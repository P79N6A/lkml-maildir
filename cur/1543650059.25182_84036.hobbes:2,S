So I have a slight correction to make to the above ;-) Your patches
do work just fine, no crashes any more. HOWEVER ... turns out I only
had the first patch installed, not both. Silly mistake, but turns out
to be very interesting. 
So your second patch is the balance on exec stuff ... I've looked at 
it, and think it's going to be very expensive to do in practice, at
least the simplistic "recalc everything on every exec" approach. It 
does benefit the low end schedbench results, but not the high end ones,
and you can see the cost of your second patch in the system times of
the kernbench.
In summary, I think I like the first patch alone better than the 
combination, but will have a play at making a cross between the two.
As I have very little context about the scheduler, would appreciate
any help anyone would like to volunteer ;-)
Corrected results are:
