That's because you're running out of address space, not memory.
HIGHMEM doesn't do anything for the latter -- it can't.  You start
running into a lot of fundamental problems when your memory size gets
in the same (or higher) ballpark than your address space.
The best solution is go buy a 64-bit CPU.  There isn't much else you
can do about it.
