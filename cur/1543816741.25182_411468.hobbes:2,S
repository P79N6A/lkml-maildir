Another happy prefetch user chiming in (sadly, without rigorous scientific 
research -- my team of monkeys is too busy at the moment). In my case, I have 
a gig of RAM, but I'm a pig when it comes to leaving applications open. 
Testimonials may not meet the appropriate criteria for merging a patch; I 
hope, though, that the aggregate value of these messages, in considering this 
issue, is more than that of mere noise.
