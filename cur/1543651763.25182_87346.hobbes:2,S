Hello there,
in a yesterday mail titled "ACPI does not switch off the laptop" I
have reported that I was not able to switch the computer off using any
of "halt" and "poweroff" command. I now would like to apologize. It
turns out that I was not loading ospm_system and ospm_processor
modules. When I *do load* them, then "halt" switches the computer off
as expected. According to the ACPI kernel document this is an expected
feature. Thus, I was wrong and I have to apologize.
Anyway, many thanks to you all your useful answers and help.
