Renicing all xmms threads to -2 makes the problem impossible to
trigger in this way. I'm sorry for having such a stupid testcase;
Mathematica is proprietary software, and judging by the way it makes
XMMS skip, it's probably doing something stupid. XMMS also has a "Use
realtime priority" option, which makes it do:
	sparam.sched_priority = sched_get_priority_max(SCHED_RR);
	sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_RR, &sparam);
Obviously, this requires root privileges, however, it also prevents
the skipping. I wonder if setting CAP_SYS_NICE on xmms and hacking it
to ignore geteuid() would be safe.
