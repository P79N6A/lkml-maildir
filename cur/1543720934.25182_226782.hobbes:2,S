Subject: TCP NFS to Novell does not work

Using kernel 2.4.26, I am unable to copy large files to novell over TCP
NFS.  It copies part of the file, the I get a "stale NFS file handle" error. 
I can then delete the file on novell over NFS without a problem.  I do not
have this problem coping to a tru64 mount.
UDP works, but I get corruption in the file.  Which I shouldn't get.
