Now, if the NIC were to integrate with OpenSSL and offload some of THAT
donkey work... Just offloading DES isn't terribly useful, as Pavel says:
apart from anything else, DES is a bit elderly now - SSH using 3DES or
Blowfish etc... How dedicated is this card? Could it be used to offload
other work?
