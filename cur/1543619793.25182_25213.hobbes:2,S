I am not the author, so the following is speculation.
My guess is that apm_get_battery_status() was written to
support multiple batteries (supported by APM 1.2 only) but
that the authors never got around to providing a user
interface to this functionality; so it remains ifdeffed out.
(Hence the function never "stopped" being used.)
The current official maintainer of the driver is Stephen Rothwell.
Stephen: How do you think the info about the second battery
might be furnished to the user?
