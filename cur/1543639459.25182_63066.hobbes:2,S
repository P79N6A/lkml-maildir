Cool, thanx Jesse, I always wondered what the history was behind it and
how to achieve it.
Here is another query:
If each printer had their own set of error codes, what would be the way to
implement their display from the kernel?
Would each printer have to have their own module if they had a non-standard
list of error codes or would we simply ignore them and state that the
ill conforming printer is on fire?
