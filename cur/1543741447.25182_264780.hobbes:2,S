I've seen this too when trying to get Suspend going under
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC (vanilla 2.6.9 IIRC - 2.6.8.1 otherwise). I'll be
looking to track down the cause anyway, so if noone else beats me to it,
I should have a better idea within a day or two (time-to-do-it
permitting).
Regards,
Nigel

Everyone lives by faith. Some people just don't believe it.
Want proof? Try to prove that the theory of evolution is true.
