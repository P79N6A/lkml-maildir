Take a look at tg3.c net driver change 
2fbe43f6f631dd7ce19fb1499d6164a5bdb34568 which is a similar situation.
However, it may turn out that removing the pci_intx() stuff as a general 
rule is easier than quirking these devices, if enough of them turn out 
to have this hardware bug.
The tg3.c change should illustrate how to fix immediately, though.
