I'd agree if the sole purpose of the kernel were to run those drivers.
But if it were built for other reasons, such as an experiment in a
different kind of operating system, and it happens to have very good
support for the Linux driver API?  I'd say that's not a derivative
work, even though the interface is clearly designed to support Linux
drivers.  But now we _are_ into the lawyer zone.

I do not see any practical alternative way to create a new kind of
operating system kernel that is compatible with the wide range of PC
hardware, other than:
  (a) read lots of open source code and then write drivers,
      filesystems etc. from what is learned, or
  (b) just use the available code with appropriate wrapping.
Both are lots of work.  But isn't (b) going to be less work?  I'm not
sure.
Your mention of Mach leads me to imagine someone saying "don't waste
your energies writing a new kernel, spend them improving Linux!".  But
then I think, how is it conceivable to "improve" Linux into a very
different vision of what an OS kernel can be like?  No, it is
necessary to experiment with radical new things to try the ideas out,
yet it is quite impractical to develop drivers from scratch without
at least _reading_ existing open source code.  And then, maybe it is
easier to build wrappers than to learn and rewrite.
This whole question comes from that, and the question of whether any
radical experiment in kernel design would have to be GPL'd to take
advantage of the Linux driver code, or whether said code would have to
be rewritten.  (The advantage of the latter is that ideas from many
operating systems could be more effectively integrated, though, such
as combining hard drive blacklists from BSD and Linux, etc.)
