No, we (or at least I) might want to allow filenames with special powers.
For example:
	mkdir -p /var/lib/private
	chmod 700 /var/lib/private
	mkdir -p /var/lib/public
	chmod 755 /var/lib/public
	make_some_data > /var/lib/private/file
	chmod 600 /var/lib/private/file
	ln -s /var/lib/private/file /var/lib/public/file
	# Everything up to now is standard stuff.  
	# Here's the new stuff:
	chmod a+s (insert magic here) /var/lib/public/file
From here on, anyone can access '/var/lib/private/file' if (and only if)
they follow the symlink '/var/lib/public/file'.
