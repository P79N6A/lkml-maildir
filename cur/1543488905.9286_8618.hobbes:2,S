Hi all,
today I tested the harddisk-performance of my server (EIDE/2.0.36), 
dd if=100M-File of=/dev/null needed 16.5sec ==> 6M/sec (good for an
old AMD K5 based on an old mainboard).
This server is direct connected to my other mashine via 5m C5 X-link
cable (this should be ok).
Both mashines have a "D-Link somewhat"-card based on DEC 21140
("tulip"/100MBit).
Reading the same file over nfs on my other mashine´s /dev/null needs
>50 seconds, this is less than 2 M/sec.
What is the problem? Where is the real "bottleneck" (is this right
word in english too?) on the data´s way?
technical  details of the mashines:
	server (rhb):				"other" (rhb1):
CPU:	AMD K5@133 MHz			AMD K6-2 300 @300 MHz
RAM:	64M EDO				96M SDRAM
NIC:	-------  D-Link based on DEC 21140/ 100MBit --------
HDD:	IBM DTTA#??? (10 GB, 5400 RPM)	isn´t interesting
SYS:	2.0.36 (no patches)		2.2.1 (no network-relevant patches)
Have a look on the bing-results in the attachment.
What else do you need? What else may be useful to find the real
bottleneck?
Greetings
Raphael Becker
