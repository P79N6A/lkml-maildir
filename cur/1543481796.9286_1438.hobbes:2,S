This hack works perfectly, thanks a lot!  So far zero hangs.  Pages seem
to also download with less stalling (esp. connections to MS-IIS).  In case
anyone is using the libc5 version of netscape make sure to change the line
below: 
 {
   int i;
 
-   dlhdl = dlopen("/lib/libc.so.6", RTLD_NOW);
+   dlhdl = dlopen("/lib/libc.so.5", RTLD_NOW);
 
   if (! dlhdl)
     exit(99);
 
and also to link against libdl.so.1, use
ld -shared -o libnspipepatch.so /lib/libdl.so.1 nspipepatch.o
Otherwise, you'll get an instant segfault  :-0
		Cheers,
