Alternatively, we can also fix it by calling pci_enable_device() again
in tg3_open().  But I think it is better to just always save and restore
in suspend/resume.  bnx2.c will also require the same fix.
Thanks Joachim for helping to debug this problem.  Please try this
patch:
[TG3]: Fix suspend/resume problem.
Joachim Deguara <joachim.deguara@amd.com> reported that tg3 devices
would not resume properly if the device was shutdown before the system
was suspended.  In such scenario where the netif_running state is 0,
tg3_suspend() would not save the PCI state and so the memory enable bit
and bus master enable bit would be lost.
We fix this by always saving and restoring the PCI state in
tg3_suspend() and tg3_resume() regardless of netif_running() state.
