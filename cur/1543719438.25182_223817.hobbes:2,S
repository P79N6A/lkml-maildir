I've posted an updated via-velocity driver to 
	
ftp://people.redhat.com/alan/Kernel
The new tar ball contains the following changes
	-	Fix two 64bit problems
	-	Fix various formatting and other related cleanup
		things 
	-	Fix crash on down
	-	Switch ethtool to new ethool ops (fixes ethtool crash)
	-	Add power management back
	-	Fix multiple power management bugs in the via driver
		(errors copied from and still present in many existing drivers
		 including 3c59x)
	-	Remove unneeded chain of velocity_info structs
	-	Clean up transmit packet length logic
	-	Added module_license tag note to the header file
	-	Renamed header file to match c file
The driver still lacks copybreak and scatter gather optimisations. I've
tagged a few possible improvements with "FIXME" in the comments if anyone
is interested.
