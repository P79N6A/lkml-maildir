How about if this function avoided charging the root cgroup? You'd
save 4 atomic operations on a global data structure on every
mmap/munmap when the virtual address limit cgroup wasn't in use, which
could be significant on a large system. And I don't see situations
where you really need to limit the address space of the root cgroup.
