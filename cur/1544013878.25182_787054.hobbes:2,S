Subject: [git patches] Ocfs2 patches for merge window

Hi Linus,
	Here are the Ocfs2 patches for this merge window. Everything (minus
the topmost, trivial fix) has been sent to LKML for review, including all
outside-of-ocfs2 patches. Since there's a lot of patches, I did it in stages:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/19/280
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/22/213
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/25/123
I'll include the contents of my original descriptions after the diffstat, so
you can get all the gory details. I'll give some highlights here:
- New features: ACL, security attributes, user/group quotas, metadata
  checksums.
- The majority of patches outside of Ocfs2 are due to Jan's work on quota
  code, which Ocfs2 wanted so that we could add quota support. Jan has been Cc'd
  on this mail.
- The other non-fs/ocfs2 patch is to JBD2 - it adds some support we needed
  to enable the metadata checksumming. The patch has made rounds on
  ext4-devel and LKML a few times now. Ted has been Cc'd on this mail.

Subject: [git patches] Ocfs2 patches for merge window, batch 1/3
Hi,
As of right now, the upstream-linus branch in ocfs2.git has 136 patches for
the next merge window. Luckily, a large chunk of those are either small or
easily read. Also, many of them are generic quota changes (which already
have appropriate review and signoffs) which I carried in ocfs2.git because
Ocfs2 quotas depended on them.
Regardless, I plan to post the ocfs2 merge window patches in 3 batches to
make review easier. The first set of patches follows this mail. The final
two will be sent early next week.
Aside from some xattr cleanups and fixes, these patches include supoprt for
POSIX ACLs and security attributes. These are implemented as special
extended attributes in a similar manner to other file systems.
2.6.28 added Ocfs2 support for JBD2, and made it the default. A patch is in
here which drops support for JBD completely from Ocfs2. This should make
coding up new features easier as we only have one journaling layer to
target. Users will see no difference as JBD2 is already backwards
compatible with JBD formatted journals.
The other set of cleanups in this series is to our meta data I/O paths. Joel
did a lot of work to seperate those paths into block specific calls (with an
appropriate generic helper). This not only reduced arguments at each call
site, but it allowed us to do more efficient checking for corrupted meta
data. In the 3rd round, these internal hooks will be used to enable meta
data checksums on Ocfs2.

Subject: [git patches] Ocfs2 patches for merge window, batch 2/3
Hi,
This is the second batch of Ocfs2 patches intended for the merge window. The
1st batch were sent out previously:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/19/280
The bulk of this set is comprised of Jan Kara's patches to add quota support
to Ocfs2. Many of the quota patches are to generic code, which I carried to
make merging of the Ocfs2 support easier. All of the non-ocfs2 patches
should have appropriate signoffs. Quota is handled a bit differently in
Ocfs2 than other file systems. We keep a set of node local quota files (user
and group), which periodically sync with a global file. This allows for a
higher level of concurrency on multi-node clusters. Additionally, a small
portion of each quota block is reserved for later use as a checksum field.
The other non-trivial part of this series is comprised of some more meta
data I/O cleanups by Joel. This time the focus is on writing of leaves in
indexed xattr trees and managing those changes in a fashion which makes the
meta data checksum patches in round 3 more straight forward.

Subject: [git patches] Ocfs2 patches for merge window, batch 3/3
Hi,
This is the 3rd and final batch of Ocfs2 patches intended for the merge
window. The 2nd batch were sent out previously:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/22/213
This batch includes some more xattr fixes, some dlm fixes from Sunil and
meta data checksumming support from Joel.
With all the other prep patches, the checksumming patches become pretty
straight forward. Mostly it's a matter of finding the right spot in our disk
structures. For most blocks, we just take an unused field. Directory data
gets a hidden structure at the end of every block. We'll actually be making
use of this structure in the future for directory indexing support. The
checksum code stores an ECC in each 64 bit field, so single bit errors can
be corrected as those blocks are read.
Checking on read is done with the per-metadata-type callbacks we previously
added. Write checks are done via a new jbd2 mechanism - 'buffer triggers',
which is implemented in the 1st patch of this series. The first version of
the buffer triggers patch got Ted's sign off, but we made some changes and
sent another version to the ext4 list. The version sent here is the latest
one. if I got my git send-email command right, Ted and the Ext4 list should
be CC'd.
