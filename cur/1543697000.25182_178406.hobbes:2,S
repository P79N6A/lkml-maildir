I've had your swsusp hang, panic, go into a half-suspended state where I have 
to hold the power button ten seconds to actually power it off and reboot, and 
fail in a few other ways.  What I've never actually had your code do is 
successfully suspend something I could resume from.
90% of the time, patrick's code does that for me.  Yours has yet to do so even 
once for me.
I suppose I could give it another shot, though...
