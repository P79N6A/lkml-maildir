The matrox framebuffer works with 2.6.0-test11 and a matrox G550.
This is statically compiled, with smp and preempt.
It dies if I use fbcon + the ruby patch (for multiple keyboard support) though.
So something is wrong - this patch changes the console but not the fb driver
so it isn't supposed to crash.  I guess there's some problem with the driver
that gets triggered only in some circumstances.
