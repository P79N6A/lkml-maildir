In 2.4 suse kernels you could set HZ at boot time. Since it doesn't seems
possible to find a HZ value that makes everybody happy, would be feasible
to do what suse did?
Some distros are already carrying programs which try to guess if a box
is a laptop or not, and then set some parameters (laptop-mode, cpufreq)
if they are. If HZ could be set at boot time they could use those heuristics
to add a extra boot flag in the boot loader without needing to recompile
the kernel
It'd be very uselful for distros, the same distro can be installed in a
multimedia-oriented box or a laptop, and no default is going to make
everybody happy...
