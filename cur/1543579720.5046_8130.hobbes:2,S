<P><FONT SIZE=2>Hello</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>I am hoping someone can give me a little information or point me in the right direction.&nbsp; I would like to write an application that monitors I/O on a linux machine, but I need some help in determining where to get the information I'm looking for.&nbsp; What I would like to do is 'hook' into the kernel and record information such as volume name, type of request (read or write), the amount of data being read or written, how long each transaction takes....&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Any help would be greatly appreciated, or if there is something like this already available that would be even better.&nbsp; Thanx</FONT></P>
