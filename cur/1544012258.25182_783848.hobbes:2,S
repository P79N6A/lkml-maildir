No, the problem is that early_param() get parsed *earlier* with these
changes.  x86 relied on the e820 map already being set up.  Most archs
(like powerpc) just set a "memory_limit" and handle it later; this
is in fact how the vast majority of early_param() work.
This cleanup is getting hairier, however we should see it as a chance
to clean some of this code too I guess...
Thanks,
Rusty.
