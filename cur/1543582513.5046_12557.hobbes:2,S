   I just tried with 2.4.1-ac14, raid and raid1 compiled in and it did the
   same thing.  I'm going to try to compile reiserfs in (if I have enough room
   to still fit the kernel on the floppy with it's initial ramdisk, etc.) and
   see what that does.
Hmm.  reiserfs is probably OK as a module.  ac14 is 5 versions
'behind'.  I'd start looking for a distribution problem.
