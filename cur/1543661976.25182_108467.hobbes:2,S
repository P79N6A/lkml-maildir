Unfortunately I can't help you understand it, but this is what I found
with my pratical experience, I found it the first time in my alpha years
ago when I increased the sym to 512k in early 2.4 then since it could
break stuff we added the max_sectors again in 2.4. But of course if you
don't fix readahead there's no way reads can take advantage of these
lowlevel fixes. I thought I fixed readahead too but I felt it got backed
out and when I noticed I resurrected it in my tree (see the name of the
patch ;)

this is not the way I thought at it. I'm interested to give an hint
only to know for sure which are the intermediate sync dependent reads
(the obvious example is when doing the get_block and walking the
3 level of inode indirect metadata blocks with big files, or while
walking the balanced tree in reiserfs), and I'm not interested at all
about writes. And I would just set an higher timeout when a read that I
know for sure (thanks to the hint) is "intermdiate" is completed. We can
use high timeouts there because we know they won't trigger 90% of the
time, a new dependent read will be always submitted first.
