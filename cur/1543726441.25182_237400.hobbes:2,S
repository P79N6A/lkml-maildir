The old hd driver should support this in 2.4 and 2.6. Its fair to
say that neither hd.c nor xd.c get much testing nowdays. One of the
biggest problems tends to be finding a machine you can use the old MFM
cards in because any motherboard disk controller will clash.
If you aren't in any hurry you can call handler() from the start of the
timer timeout function if you lack IRQ's.
