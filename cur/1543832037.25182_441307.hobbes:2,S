Ah, yes I missed that. It works there two. I had something wrong
about how I accessed cpu_data. I am used to the elegant way we
do it on IA-64 but on x86_64 you have to index the cpu_data[]
array with smp_processor_id(). I was pointing to cpu_data[0]
on all processors.
For what I need, I can do cpuinfo_x86->apicid & 0x3 to identify
which thread is running. I can now remove some more code in perfmon2.
Thanks for your help.
