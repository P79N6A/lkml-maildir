The colon for consistency with maps in /proc. I think it also makes it
slightly more readable.
For %lld versus %llu - I think that cgroup resource APIs are much more
likely to need to report unsigned rather than signed values. In the
case of the memory.stat file, that's certainly the case.
But I guess there's an argument to be made that nothing's likely to
need the final 64th bit of an unsigned value, whereas the ability to
report negative numbers could potentially be useful for some cgroups.
