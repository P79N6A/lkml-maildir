You just need day or WEEK of downtime for that in some cases :-) Really nice.
Thnx for big present. Why so much ? It's simple: think about server installed
on ISP. Thee are just ONE service offeren by ISP: give us your system (without
keyboard and monitor, obviously) and will'll plug in it two connectors:
power and ethernet. You need to do some service with your system ? No
problem: write offer to replace it with other system and no slower then in
week time we'll replace it (usually it takes less then day though). Looks
overly draconian to you ? May be. But it's CHEAP service! Of course this web
server is not mission-critical and you can tolerate this few days downtime
once or twice per year. Now: do you really think you should wait for system
to crash so you can fix security problem in NIC's firmware ?

See above. This service is TYPICAL. It's NOT something unique. Really. And
Linux is used VERY often on such systems.

See above. Your approarch will not work for LOTS AND LOTS systems out there.
"One size does not fit all". Really.
