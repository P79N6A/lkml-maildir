ftape-4.04? That's been a non-integrated external package for ages and ages.
I doubt there's been any updates in it for 2.5/2.6 kernels.
I used to use ftape-4 snapshots in late 2.1 and most 2.2 kernels, but patch
maintenance overhead made me go back to the kernel's ftape before 2.4.0.
Given how few still use these antiques (my "fast" Conner/Seagate drive gives
150KBps backup speed, wow!) I think simply maintaining status quo is the most
reasonable use of peoples' time.
