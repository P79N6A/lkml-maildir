12GB-16GB worked well historically so its a regression. Above 16GB its
all utterly mad.
You forgot reason (c) though
(c) 32bit is a tested approved certified etc environment - essentially
conservativsm and paranoia, and its hard to explain to some of these
people that the right answer really is less RAM or 64bit, especially as
they may already know it but have a 12 month process to prove and certify
a system configuration.

Highmem to 4GB was sensible. Highmem to 8GB was pushing it.
