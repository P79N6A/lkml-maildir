Hi,
I'm heavily using initrd and ramdisk for running and installing software
from cdrom.
The boot sequence runs as foolows from a bootable cdrom :
 syslinux loads linux and initrd.gz, unpacks linux and initrd and run the
 application linuxrc. linuxrc does nothing else than installing either on
 harddisk or completely in RAM.
  - If I'm installing the software on harddisk, all installation is ok and
    I can use the software directly after setting real-root-dev
    (e.g. 769 for /dev/hda1 [b 3 1]) unmounting all fs and exiting linuxrc
  - If I'm installing the software in ramdisks (several, because of size),
    the messages are as follows with 2.2.1 :
      "VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem)"
      "change_root: old root has d_count=1"
      "Trying to unmount old root ... okay"
      "Freeing unused kernel memory: 40k freed"
      "Kernel panic: Noinit found.  Try passing init= option to kernel."
    And all is over.
I did
 - changing the root-ramdisk (/dev/ramX) with changing the value for
   real-root-dev
 - placed an extra /bin/sh on _every_ ramdisk to see at least a shell
   prompt
 - replaced (only) the kernel,
    - "change_root: old root has d_count=5"
      Some more error messages because of that, same last words.
I'm mounting the correct ramdisk as root, because /dev/console is found.
If I'm removing that entry before unmounting the ramdisk, a warning is
displayed when the root ramdisk is mounted again. 
I checked on the ramdisk, if there is /sbin/init, /bin/sh and it is before
unmounting. 
I'm using ramdisk_size=8192 in the append-line, but don't ask me to
use normal ramdisk size 4096 without a fair chance that this will be the
error.
Regards and TIA
Frank
