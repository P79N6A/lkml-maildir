I'll let David and/or Stephen address this in detail, but what's being 
added here is a security asbtraction, where we consider these operations 
to be equivalent from an access control point of view.  So, one task 
causing another task's memory to be moved to another node is conisdered to 
be "setting memory policy" at a conceptual level.  Perhaps we could change 
the name of the hook to make that clearer (which you suggest below).

Yes, the hook is also added to sys_move_pages() in the patch.
