I made a naive stress test (untaring a 5GB archive into an ext3 filesystem
on a LVM volume, while running fsx on the same filesystem (don't know if it
is relevant for this problem) and throwing in an occasional hdparm -Tt) and
everything looked good, even mozilla was still responsive. 
Thanks for your help.
