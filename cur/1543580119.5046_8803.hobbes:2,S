you never gave the model of the hard drive (or if you did, i didn't
see it), but you did say a 10k rpm ibm.  i am going to assume it is
u2w/lvd capable.  no lvd hard drive has termination built in.  you
must use a seperate termination device at the end of the ribbon.  or
you can use a terminating cable.  since your controller is a
single-ended device, get a single-ended, wide, active terminator and
plug it into the end of the ribbon.  put the hard drive in the middle
somewhere.
