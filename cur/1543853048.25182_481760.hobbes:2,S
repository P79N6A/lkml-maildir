I get nearly the same oopses on my thinkpad t60, too.
Always only after resuming (never after a clean reboot), and after the 
(otherwise successfull) resume it can take hours until the oops shows.
Did not report this problem anywhere yet, because I am using a heavily 
modified 2.6.17 based on the ubuntu edgy tree plus lots of addon patches 
(suspend2, linux-vserver, loop-aes) and most of the time with the evil 
fglrx loaded, too (to get any x11 outputs at all).

Will try to shutdown wireless and unload the module before the next 
suspend, and see if it helps.
