Unfortunately, the Makefile doesn't really know about the Kconfig files, 
the "source drivers/whatever/Kconfig" commands are in Kconfig, and 
duplicating them into the Makefile would be rather error-prone.
Even if that was done, the Makefiles also cannot know about e.g. headers 
included into C files, so it'd die at that point. At some point I hacked a 
LD_PRELOAD library which would try to exec a "get" when open(2) fails, 
which fixes gcc, kconfig and whatnotsoever. I suppose a better solution is 
"checkout: get", though.
