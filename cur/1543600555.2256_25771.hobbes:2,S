No, your patch  didn't work.
I have still the oops.
I investigates, and the oops come in the mountall script (in init.d),
when running: mount -avt nonfs,nosmbfs.
(I noticed thet at this point kernel load floppy modules, but when I
removed also the floppy module, the oops reappers.)
Note: only the first time I run the script  the kernel oops, thus
on normal boot sequence debian would not mount my partitions :-(.
