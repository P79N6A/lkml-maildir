Subject: [PATCH 2.6.13-git] Fix IXP4xx CLOCK_TICK_RATE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[RMK is out for the week so sending this direct as it should go into 2.6.13]
As pointed out in the following thread, the CLOCK_TICK_RATE setting for
IXP4xx is incorrect b/c the HW ignores the lowest 2 bits of the LATCH value.

Tnx to George Anziger and Egil Hjelmeland for finding the issue.

Even a stopped clock gives the right time twice a day.
