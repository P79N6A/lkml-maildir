The one-liner which was added to slab.c in test3-pre7 has triggered a
gcc-2.7.2.3 bug and I'm getting uptimes of 0.1 seconds :(
Could we please back it out?

 /* Guard access to the cache-chain. */
This initialisation is already done in kmem_cache_init(), so it's not
needed.
What's happening is that gcc is emitting the following initialiser:
cache_cache:
        .long cache_cache
        .long cache_cache
        .long cache_cache
        .long 100
        .long 4096
        .zero   72               <<<<<<< Bogus!!!
        .zero   4
        .long 0
        .zero   12
        .long 32
        .zero   28
        .string "kmem_cache"
        .zero   9
        .long cache_cache+92
        .long cache_cache+92
And I get a divide by zero at the end of kmem_cache_init(), dividing by
cache_cache.colour_off.
