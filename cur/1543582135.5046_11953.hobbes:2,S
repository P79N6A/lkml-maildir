Page fault handling is unchanged, but perhaps there are other races. And
note that these races wouldn't be processor bugs - the spec nowhere
guarantee the behaviour you assume.
Ben tries to prove that the current cpu _never_ sets the dirty bit
without checking the present bit.
A very simple test might be
cpu 1:
	cli();
	a = 0; b = 0; m = 0;
	flush_local_tlb_page(a);
	flush_local_tlb_page(b);
	flush_local_tlb_page(a);
	while(!m);
	while (!a && !b);
	a = 1;
cpu 2:
	<wait>
	cli();
	both ptes for a and b as writable, not dirty.
	m = 1;
	udelay(100);
	change the pte of a to not present.
	wmb();
	b = 1;
Now start with variants:
change to read only instead of not present
a and b in the same way of the tlb, in a different way.
change pte with write, change with lock;
.
.
.
But you'll never prove that you tested every combination.
