vmsplice() really just fills the pipe with the user data, at least that
is how I implemented it. Then you'd use splice to actually splice that
pipe to a socket, for instance.

It should be able to, yes. Seems to me it should just work like regular
splicing, with the difference that you'd have to wait for the reference
count to drop before reusing. One way would be to do as Linus suggests
and make the vmsplice call block or just return -EAGAIN if we are not
ready yet. With that pollable, that should suffice?
