Hi!
Thanks to Steven's Kconfig fixes I was able to compile 2.6.15-rc5 with
Ingo's rt2-patch just fine.
I have two small problem with it, however. One is the Oops just posted, the
other is a high system load and bad responsiveness of the system as a
whole. I didn't even bother to measure timer/sleep jitters as the system
was dog slow and the fans started to run a full speed nearly immediately.
We observed this on two different systems, one with the config attached to
my mail with the Oops/backtrace.
I'll try to recompile the kernel with some debug options, if anyone knows if
there's something I should specifically look for this may be helpful.
Greetings,
  Gunter
