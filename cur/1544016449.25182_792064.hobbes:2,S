I suppose that the fact that it already depends on !SMP should keep
it hidden from most people, and it does work just fine for !PREEMPT.
My concern is rather that if no one is using it, the code will bitrot
rather quickly.  None of us needs a broken RCU implementation in mainline,
least of all me.  ;-)

Yeah, I have had to refer a number of institutions to various LWN
articles.  I think that it is safe to say that LWN is not on every
university's normal reading list.  ;-)  One (surprisingly prominent)
institution that -does- read LWN unfortunately chose "The design
of preemptible read-copy-update" to introduce themselves to RCU
(
http://lwn.net/Articles/253651/
), and, needless to say, found it
tough going.  I offered my sympathies and pointed them at the "What is
RCU?" LWN series.
So it might well be good to have simplified implementations for academic
study and perhaps also for deep embedded use.  Sort of like the approach
for designing video games -- easy first level, second level is a bit
harder, and so on.
