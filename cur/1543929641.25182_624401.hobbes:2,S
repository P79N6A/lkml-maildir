The idea is to not touch the unicast stuff at all on the multicast path.
Anyway, this was discussed on netdev so please check the archives because
there is more to this than just changing the multicast handling.  We also
talked about consolidating the driver interface so that all these calls
have the same environment rather than the mix-and-match that we have now.
Cheers,
