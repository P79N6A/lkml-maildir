Hi,
Looks interesting.  Is there experience about this in bridging firewall 
scenarios? (With or without external patchset's like 
http://ebtables.sourceforge.net/
)
Further, you mention the performance reasons for this approach.  I would 
be very interested to see some figures.
(As it happens, we've done some testing with different iptables rules
ourselves, and noticed significant problems especially when you go down
from IP addresses to UDP/TCP ports, for example.)
