I meant to create a storage on top of several nodes one needs to have
device mapper or something like that on top of NBD itself. To further
export resulted device one needs another userspace NDB application and 
so on. DST simplifies that greatly.
DST original code worked as device mapper plugin too, but its two 
additional allocations (io and clone) per block request ended up for me 
as a show stopper.
