Or hardware, or SMM ....
There are some very complex obscure platform specific funnies that end
up solved by serialize that I doubt anyone will get to the bottom of
before all the worlds parallel ATA drives have turned to rust (and/or
sand).
It seems the gnome desktop disease[1] is spreading to some kernel
people. It's all init code, its cheap and it works. Making it automated
in more cases is great, but you'll never stamp out the need for the
manual one even if its to do the debug to get the automated case right.
