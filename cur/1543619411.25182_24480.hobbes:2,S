        Just an FYI.. when one runs 'make xconfig', and goes to request help 
on a certain option given, a message comes up:
                                RTFM
No Help available - unable to open file Documentation/Configure.help. This 
file should have come with your kernel.
        Vanilla 2.5.3 and the patch for it, removes the file. Is this being 
worked on? make oldconfig will work for now, but just a heads up.
                                                        BL.
