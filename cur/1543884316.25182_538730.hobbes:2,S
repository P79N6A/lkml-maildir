I see. He also moves these defines to another file. Not problem where they 
are. But it isn't possible to replace the macros by the inlined functions in 
processor.h. The used outb/inb macros fail for various other files.

All right. To wait is no problem for me (my system works with my 
patch.... ;-) )

As I can see the macros are used in:
 - i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/gx-suspmod.c (ups, its not in my patch, so it is
   currently no complete)
 - i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/state.c (also not part of my patch yet)
 - i386/kernel/cpu/cyrix.c
 - i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/cyrix.c
Most comments states Cyrix CPUs when they are using the macros. Is anything 
with Cyrix 64 bit relevant? Maybe "include/asm-x86_64/processor.h" is a 
simple copy of "include/asm-i386/processor.h" and nobody delete the unused 
macros?
Please keep me informed and I will resend the patch.
