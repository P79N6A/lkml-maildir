Point taken, I generally play embedded MPU where the codebase matches the 
specific hardware version and one set of docs suffice, although it is not
uncommon to rediscover an unpublished bug.
This one codebase for all hardware certainly is a lot more work!
Do you know if the Athlon apic programming docs are available or under NDA?
I do not even want to ask about the nvidia nforce2 chipset.
