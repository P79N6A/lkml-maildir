Hi everyone,
After a lot of experimenting with both the 2.2 and 2.0 kernels and ppp on
a 33K6 line, we have discovered some anomalies in the 2.2 ppp stack.
We can't put our finger on it yet, but it seems that if you use a MTU/MRU
of 1500 for ppp connects the 2.2 kernel is doing fine, but when you use a
lower MTU, fi 576 for better response on slow links, packages seem to get
lost.
So far we have seen this behaveour on all 2.2 kernels that have a
different MTU on the internal ethernet adapter and the external ppp
adapter.
Using the same hardware with 2.0 kernels gave us better results, no
package loss anymore.
It's rather hard for us to figure out where this problem is coming from,
so far our guess is that the code that is used to defragment fragmented
packages in the 2.2 kernel is not what it's supposed to be.
If anyone is willing to take a look at this and needs more info we 're
happy to provide it, just mail us.
Regards,
Homme R. Bitter
