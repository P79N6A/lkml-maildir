If you have decided to allow the process to use CAP_NET_ADMIN by adding
the text "capability net_admin," to the profile in question, I fail to
see how this is "scary" -- in fact, this is exactly what you have chosen
to allow this process to do.
One of our developers has a profile set of 827 profiles that we use for
testing system functionality and our tools; twenty of those profiles have
"capability net_admin" granted. The other 807 profiles do not have the
ability to reconfigure the network at will.
I hope this clears up your concern. Thanks Arjan
