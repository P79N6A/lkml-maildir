I've seen it happen during stresstest of an underpowered
test box. When that point is reached, the system usually
is already so far overloaded there's little point in
allowing extra processes to be started.

The only real use I could see would be to allow root to
start up some commands to save the box when it's going
down the drain.  Probably not worth it since root could
have just used ulimit for the normal users ;)
