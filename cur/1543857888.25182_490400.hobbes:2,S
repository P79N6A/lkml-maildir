No, not "pure".  That's something else.

Maybe you should do:
	extern __attibute__((x, y, z))
	void function_prototype(...);
Then it doesn't hinder it anywhere near as much as, say:
	extern void __fastcall function_prototype(...);
Besides, emacs lights up __attribute__'s in funky colours to make them easier
to look past:-)
