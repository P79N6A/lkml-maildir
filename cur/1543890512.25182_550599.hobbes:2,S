Subject: [PATCH] add a trivial patch style checker v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/29/361

We are seeing increasing levels of minor patch style violations in
submissions to the mailing lists as well as making it into the tree.
These detract from the quality of the submission and cause unnessary
work for reviewers.
As a first step package up the current state of the patch style
checker and include it in the kernel tree.  Add instructions
suggesting running it on submissions.  This adds version v0.01 of
the checkpatch.pl script.

	Ok, here is V2 of the checker.	A lot of feedback has been
	incorporated including changing its name to better fit with
	the current naming of other things in the scripts directory.
	Changelog:
	o new name checkpatch.pl
	o also mention in Documentation/SubmitChecklist
	o whitespace cleanups
	o if () { spacing cleanups
	o improves signoff handling
	o goto label handling improved and message clarified
	o handle deprecated headers using feature-removal-schedule.txt
	o fixed reference to section in Documentation/SubmittingPatches
