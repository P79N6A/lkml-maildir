Hi I had a similar problem with my Sony CDU926 cdr drive & advansys
controller. I used to be able to crash it at will by ripping audio off the
cdr with cd paranoia, stopping it mid way then doing it again straight
after. Would cause the same error. The system would apear to hang. After a
while the prompt would return. Then rmmod advansys would cause a complete
system lockup. However, since 2.2.1 I haven't been able to repeat it.
Cheers,
