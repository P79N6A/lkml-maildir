this is your problem.  SDK 2.01 contains the kernel reworked for the
RadiSys board ("bridalveil/SI").  the original EVB with dual gigF 
and 8x 10/100TX doesn't work with this source.
use the source instead from the netwinder.org site with the original
intel IXP1200 how-to information.  (also, getting support on LKML for
the unofficial patches to make IXP1200 work isn't too likely :) 
you'll note that the kernel is pre-2.4.0.  ancient history. these
patches have not been incorporated in the main kernel...)
the SDK 2.x series is commented for the changes made from the 
original how-to release, and massaging #ifdef's in the code _should_
fix it, but seems not to.  i haven't done an exhaustive diff to see
where else changes have been made.
