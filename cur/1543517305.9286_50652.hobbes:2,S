Hi all,
I would like to gather process io activity.
While browsing through the source I've seen that acct.c has already
stubs for storing io activity in the activity file but that currently
it stores 0.
Also  getrusage system call, has some provision for I/O blocks read/written
to disk, but no metrics are yet stored in the task_struct so it skips them.
Is there a plan for implementing this funtionality / is someone busy with it,
or is it still an open issue.
I'm willing to contribute to this if one is doing it.
I've been checking the Solaris getrusage for this and would like to implement
in the same way (charching the fist proc for a physical read, the last
for a physical write).
