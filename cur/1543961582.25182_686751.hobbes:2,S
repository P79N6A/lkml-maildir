Well so we display out of whack backtraces? There are also issues on 
platforms that do not have a stack in the classic sense (rotating register 
file on IA64 and Sparc64 f.e.). Determining a backtrace can be very 
expensive.

The current implementation /proc/vmallocinfo avoids these issues and 
with just one caller address it can print one line per vmalloc request.
