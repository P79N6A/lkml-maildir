  In your mail from February 11, you sent an oops from 2.6.20 kernel.
That's why I was interested in the 2.6.20 kernel's vmlinux. But 2.6.19.2
would be interesting too.

  Sorry, I forgot you have to have the kernel compiled with the
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO option (in the kernel hacking section) for the above to work.
It is enough to get the vmlinux file from such compilation. You don't have
to actually run the kernel...
