Hi,
Don't know if this one has been annonced before, but if you run a PPP
connection over ttyS<x> (PPP must be connected to another peer) and then
start minicom on the same ttyS<x>, then your machine will freeze and
eventually reboot itself. Tried it on 2 different machines using a normal
2.2.13 kernel installed on a RedHat 6.1 or Mandrake 6.1 system. Haven't
tried any of the pre-patches for 2.2.14 yet.
Anybody else that can reproduce this?
