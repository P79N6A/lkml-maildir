hello-
I have no idea if this is a problem with smbmount or with the kernel
configuration, so I'm posting to both lists.
I have smbmount from samba 2.0.0, and kernel smbfs support as a module. 
When I try to use smbmount, it seems to connect ok, then I get dumped
into some sort of psuedo-smbclient mode (I get an "smb" prompt) but it
won't execute any commands (it says "command not found").  I have to
kill it with ctrl-C.  I compiled samba with:
--with-smbmount --with-automount --with-smbwrapper
I have a pretty standard redhat 5.2 system, and I upgraded everything
listed in the 2.2 Changes file.  One interesting thing I noticed is that
the smbfs module doesn't get loaded (using kmod).
Anyone have any idea what my problem might be?  Thanks in advance.
