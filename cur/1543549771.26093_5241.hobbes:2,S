The deadlock Alan pointed out can happen also with single page allocation
if we in 2.4.x-current put a loop in GFP_KERNEL.

You're right. That's why it's a waste to have so many order in the
buddy allocator. Even more now that the hashtables should be allocated
with the bootmem allocator! :) Chuck seen the slowdown of increasing
the highest order allocation in his bench. But of course in 2.2.x we can't
avoid that.
