Attempt to copy the raw drive to /dev/null.  If that works, the
drive is likely okay, but the fs got fsucked up by software. You
might be able to mount the drive on a 2.4.22 machine if you have a
spare. Then you might be able to selectively copy important stuff
to another drive, after which you can make a new file-system as
a "repair".
If you can't copy the raw drive, yet you booted on a system that
uses the same driver(s) to access the disk, then you probably
have a bad drive.
