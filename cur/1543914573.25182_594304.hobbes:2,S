Consider this case. user1 and user2 are both members of group
"allusers":
user1$ echo foo > foo
user1$ chgrp allusers foo
user1$ chmod 04770 foo
user2$ echo bar >> foo
On most local filesystems, this would work correctly. The end result
would be a file with mode 0770 and the expected contents. On NFS
though, the write by user2 fails. When the write is attempted, the
kernel tries to squash the setuid bit using the credentials of user2,
who's not allowed to change the mode. The write then fails because the
setattr fails.
There are other situations that are similar, but the bottom line is
that the linux-specific security feature doesn't work in all cases, and
in some situations it means that operations fail where they shouldn't.
