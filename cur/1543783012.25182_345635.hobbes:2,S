In kernel there are many paths how to call something in ide driver. In 
userspace there is only one --- ioctl.
In kernel you can write something like
int register_panic_event(void (*fn)(void *opaque, int stable), void 
*opaque);
void unregister_panic_event(void (*fn)(void *opaque, int stable), void 
*opaque);
and
void generate_panic_event(int stable);
... so that drivers can make hooks to do things when notebook falls. And 
it can protect not only primary IDE, but also disks on additional cards, 
USB disks etc. In userspace it would be pain to let the driver support all 
types of devices, scan for them (how?) etc.

If the daemon parks head and blocks ide queue and you kill it, the queue 
won't ever be unblocked.

The whole userspace is paged, so if the daemon locks up disk forever, it 
would be impossible to turn it off anyway (you can with some pain make the 
daemon unpaged, but you can't do that for user's shell).

They use some auto-adjusting of values. BTW. they have a bug in bios that 
it waits until stable condition and refuses to boot on a road.
Maybe something like this woule be reliable: get some value how much the 
notebook moves, if the current value greater that the average (over some 
time), park disk. --- it can't lock-up forever because the value can't 
grow forever. If you tilt the notebook on a road or move it on the table, 
it would park (which exactly what you want).
