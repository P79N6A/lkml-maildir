MODULE_xxx typically doesn't need to be surrounded by ifdef MODULE.
Also note that proc_fs.h provides no-op inline replacements for the
!CONFIG_PROC_FS case.  If you want to be really space conscious, you
still need the ifdef's in the code for the most part, but the no-ops
sometimes eliminate ifdefs if you look carefully.
