Well, your kernels must be on a 0.90-superblocked RAID-0 or RAID-1
device. It can't handle booting off 1.x superblocks nor RAID-[56]
(not that I could really hope for the latter).
But that's just /boot, not everything else.

Of course the same is true of initramfs, which can give you the 1 kernel
image back, too. (It's also nicer in that you can autoassemble
e.g. LVM-on-RAID, or even LVM-on-RAID-over-nbd if you so desire.)
