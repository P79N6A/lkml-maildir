Yes, it's necessary; no, I've never directly encountered the issue it
fixes. Sorry about the miscommunication there.

64GB on 32-bit is in the territory where it's dead, either literally,
performance-wise, or by virtue of dropping hardware on the floor (as
it's basically no longer 64GB) due to deeper design limitations.
No idea why there's not more support behind or interest in page
clustering. It's an optimization (not required) for 64-bit/saner arches.
