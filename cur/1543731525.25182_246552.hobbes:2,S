If the sensor has 640x480 Bayer half-cells (640x480 green subpixels),
then that's considered as 'true 640x480' by the industry. Green
resolution is 640x480, red and blue resolution is 640x240. A full
640x480 RGB image can be reconstructed in good quality.
And that's what I believe the cameras have - it's damn cheap in CMOS
anyways.
Now about the compression - that'll only take place when streaming (and
the lossiness will depend on the selected frame rate). When taking still
images, you should get the full resolution.
That's at least how most USB 1.1 webcams work - I don't have personal
experience with Philips webcams.

I don't think that's the reason. In the early days of webcams, the
compression method was what was differentiating the different webcam
brands.
When all have basically the same sensor, and the same USB 1.1 bandwidth,
the image quality is given by the compression. And designing a
compression algorithm so that it's both efficient and fits into only a
few logic gates (resulting in a cheap chip) is a challenge.
And the webcam companies were competing to deliver the cheapest webcam
with the best image quality. It's obvious they wanted to hide the
algorithm - copying it is rather easy.
Nowadays, there is no point in hiding it - with USB 2.0 allowing for
uncompressed video, with JPEG encoding chips being a commodity, that
competition point has disappeared.
