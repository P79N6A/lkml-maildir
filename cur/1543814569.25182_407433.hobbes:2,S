The philosophy of the -ENOMEM handling is (awkwardly?) embodied in the
comment
	 * Finally we add new pages.  This could fail, but we leave
	 * the stripe cache at it's new size, just with some pages empty.
at the top of the function.  The core function here is making some
data structures bigger.  In each case, having a bigger data structure
than required is no big deal.  So we try to increase the size of each
of them (the stripe_head cache, the 'disks' array, and the pages
allocated to each stripe.
If any of there fail we return -ENOMEM, but may allow others to
succeed.
Does that help?
