The PCMCIA SCSI card that HP is distributing with their new portable M820e
CD-R/RW drives uses a chipset made by KME (Kyushu Mitshuta sp? -- its
Panasonic) -- I believe their market name is 'NinjaSCSI' or something like
that (PCMCIA headers are "KME", "SCSI-CARD-001"). From hints in other
PCMCIA cards' config entries, I tried the qlogic driver.  NULL pointer
dereference in kernel.  Also tried the patches floating around that get
the qlogic driver to work with NinjaSCSI-3 cards.  Same problem.
Does anyone have a KME or HP contact that could give info on what needs to
be done for a driver?  Or even a driver that works with this card already?
Thanks
