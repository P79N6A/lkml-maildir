Can you please use your *poof* trick one more time to set up
linux-omap@vger.kernel.org?
We've (as in linux-omap community) would like to move from subscriber
only list at linux-omap-open-source@linux.omap.com to vger as we're
starting to get more patches and comments on LKML. For related
discussion on linux-omap-open-source@linux.omap.com, see [1].
Regards,
Tony
