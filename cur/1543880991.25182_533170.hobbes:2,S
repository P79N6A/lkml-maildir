oh, there we go.
It would have been better to have patched page_alloc.c independently, then
to have used HIGH_ORDER in "lumpy: increase pressure at the end of the inactive
list".
The name HIGH_ORDER is a bit squidgy.  I'm not sure what would be better though.
PAGE_ALLOC_CLUSTER_MAX?
It'd be interesting to turn this into a runtime tunable, perhaps.
