Grr, when did this turn into a RedHat support list?
If they're going to stuff all sorts of patches into their kernels then I don't
see what the point of posting bug reports about them to this list is. I don't
use RedHat and likely never will, and I expect that goes for many people here
(and yes, I agree, I don't know enough to do much in the way of tracking down
problems - yet - but I can't imagine other people don't feel this way too).
Now, I know Alan works for RedHat, so if his -acXX patches are the only things
that get added to RedHat kernels then it's a bit less of an issue. But it
would help if the bug reports talked about "2.2.5-ac2" instead of "2.2.5-22".
AIUI Alan is dealing with the stable series now anyway...
