I did say "relocate".  OK, so maybe the correct order is: partial
unpack, first system call, remaining unpack, relocate, second system
call.
Actually, the hard part is intermodule dependencies.  For that, the
issue becomes where the running kernel allocated address space for the
previous modules.  I suppose the insmod variant could process a stream
of modules for loading, but then relocation starts including
double-relocation for a pair of modules...  OK, maybe it is too
complex for the kernel.
