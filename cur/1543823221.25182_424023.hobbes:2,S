Ok, that's new. We knew that SIS didn't like setting interrupt
affinity on IRQ 0. Maybe VIA forgot to validate one of these cases too.
On SUSE it was workarounded in irqbalanced user space but since other 
distributions seem to be lazy to pick that fix up we should probably
do a kernel side fix. I'll put it on my todo list.
