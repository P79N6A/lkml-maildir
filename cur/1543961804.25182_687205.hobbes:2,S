Ah, please ignore my email about ITUs (Intel thermal units), then.  The
above means 1ITU=1°C, but their zeros are at different places.

Actually, just libsensors would, and the local admin can adjust it at
will using the config file.
Nobody in userspace should be reading hwmon sysfs directly without the
use of libsensors.  If they are, it is their bug, and it is unsupported
AFAIK.
