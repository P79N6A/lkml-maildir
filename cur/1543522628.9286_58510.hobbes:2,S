It will be interesting to see if this message gets to the list... I am
on my Time Warner- RoadRunner account. 
I've been lurking here for a while reading pros and cons of ORBS and I
have a silly question. If a "Spamhaus" set up their server to bounce
ORBS probes, while remaining essentially open to other relays, ORBS
would list the site as OK, wouldn't it? 
(Go ahead- probe me! <SPAM> Your packets bounce! <SPAM> I'm a closed
relay! <SPAM><SPAM>)
Don't flame me for that- I don't even run an SMTP server, much less spam
people.
Flame me instead for continuing this off-topic thread. Maybe this topic
needs it's own mailing list!
