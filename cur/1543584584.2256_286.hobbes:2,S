Figured it out -- I think. This appears to be the answer:
In struct proc_dir_entry,set the fill_inode function pointer to a
callback to handle refcounts.
struct proc_dir_entry
{
...
void (*fill_inode)(struct inode *, int);
...
};
void fill_inode_cb(struct inode *i, int v)
{
 if (v==0)
 {
  MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
  return;
 };
 if (v==1)
 {
  MOD_INC_USE_COUNT;
  return;
 };
};
... right?  :)
