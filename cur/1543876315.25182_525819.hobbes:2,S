here 'is a loser' means: "tries to back up way too much stuff instead of 
doing a nice incremental backup like it does on 2.6.20.4", correct?
since it appears to be caused by a kernel change, this is a serious 
regression in v2.6.21-to-be.

maybe it's some sort of timestamp problem, on the FS level?
