Thanks for your reply.
the sensors.conf I'm currently using is provided by Tyan, so this seems
to be ok.  One major difference that I can see: I don't have compute
statements for the CPU temperatures.  If I use your config, I get 7.8°C
:-)
So there is definitely some difference in our hardware environment. OTOH
with the "right" compute statement the problem seems fixable.
BTW: there is another hwmon chip on the board, a w83627hf.  Up to 2.6.21
this was managed by the w83781d driver, too.  Now I use the w83627hf
driver (on the isa bus).  No problem with that part.
