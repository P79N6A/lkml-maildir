Hi!
I'm working on a memory subsystem patch to deal with faulty RAM, for
instance caused by static electricity or production failures. I have
everything in place and working except for one thing: Avoiding that the
faulty pages can get allocated.
There must be a place where physical memory, after chunks are taken off of
the beginning (for page maps etc), actually are handed out to the free_area
structures, through something like __free_pages. But that routine does not
seem to be called from such code, and neither are the remap routines (only
called from drivers).
Can anybody tell me where/how the "whole" of physical memory is handed over
to the free_area structures?
Thanx a lot,
-Rick.
