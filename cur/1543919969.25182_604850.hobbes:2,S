2.6.23-smp-d-hrt + restrict fix patch
[SUM]  0.0-300.1 sec    176 GBytes  5.03 Gbits/sec
[SUM]  0.0-300.1 sec    175 GBytes  5.02 Gbits/sec
[SUM]  0.0-300.1 sec    176 GBytes  5.05 Gbits/sec
Context switches are further reduced (across the board) over
PREEMPT_RESTRICT, dropping from ~7-8k to ~2.5k with this test, vs ~950
for SCHED_BATCH and ~50k with this tree and no restriction.  Throughput
is ~96% of SCHED_BATCH, vs ~55% with no restriction.  I see no
interactivity regressions.
