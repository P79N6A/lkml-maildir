Hello everybody!
I have this question, which I would like to ask you guys.
I know that SMP works slower, because of thread contention and locking 
mechanisms.
Does it make sence to use SMP kernel still, in case of a single P4,
or should I use UP kernel and disable Hyper-Threading in the bios?
Any benchmark results would be highly appreciated.
Thank you.
