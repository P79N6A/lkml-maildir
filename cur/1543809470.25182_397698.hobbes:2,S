I'm missing something, and unfortunately that usually seems to be the case
when discussing problems of this kind.  When we pick up discussing bugs
again, please small simple steps.  We have different backgrounds and 
different base line assumptions, and different points of view, so what
is obvious to you is not obvious to me and vice versa.

But with an incomplete implementation we can discussion each others approaches.
Basically what is of interest right now are the userspace interface, 
the semantics we are trying to implement, and the maintenance issues
for the users of the code.

:)
I would draw a distinction between a mostly but buggy implementation and
an in incomplete implementation.  When you can run the code and see it doing
things some of the subtle issues are interesting.

I am not eager to introduce new syscalls.  But I am willing to consider it
when we reach far enough past a certain point.

Could be propose it and we can discuss it.  I suspect you already have something
in mid.

Thanks.  As for a meeting given that there are at least 4 different groups
in at least USA and Europe arranging it could be hard.  Currently I am aiming
at the Ottowa Linux Symposium in June.  Hopefully we won't have major 
unresolved issues by then, but it if we do we really need to get together
face to face.
