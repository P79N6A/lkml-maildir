The default for 'make' is that environment variables do _not_ override
variables defined in the Makefiles.  You can change that behaviour with
the -e flag, 'CHECK=foo make -e bzImage C=1' should work.  'info make'
recommends against using -e, changing environments can lead to
unexpected side effects.
