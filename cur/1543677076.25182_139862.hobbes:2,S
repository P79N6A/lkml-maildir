Hi,
I haven't followed the status of write barrier patches recently, I am
wondering if it's still "necessary" (to avoid file system corruption) to
disable the write cache of a SCSI disk drive when the machine doesn't
have an uninterruptible power supply or if instead the file systems and
driver know how to use ordered tags.  (Fujitsu MAP drive: 8 MB cache,
AIC7880 adapter, SuSE Linux 8.2 patched 2.4.20 kernel with ext3 and xfs)
TIA,
