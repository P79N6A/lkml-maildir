Well, I've been known to be wrong before, and this number was more based on 
the fact that I once measured a sustained transfer rate of 1M/sec on a 4x 
CDROM

This was based on DVDx16 == CDx48 - I'm guessing someone is doing some monkey 
work if a DVD is 9x a CD and a 16x DVD can't hit that mystical 52x of my 
favorite CDRW drive in pure CD read mode.
