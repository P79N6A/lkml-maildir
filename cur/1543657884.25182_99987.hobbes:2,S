How about drivers/net/sunhme.c ?
It's not scary, but it is absolutely hilarious, even to
people who don't even know C.
static void happy_meal_tcvr_write(struct happy_meal *hp,
                                  unsigned long tregs, int reg,
                                  unsigned short value)
{
        int tries = TCVR_WRITE_TRIES;
        ASD(("happy_meal_tcvr_write: reg=0x%02x value=%04x\n", reg,
value));
        /* Welcome to Sun Microsystems, can I take your order please? */
        if (!hp->happy_flags & HFLAG_FENABLE)
                return happy_meal_bb_write(hp, tregs, reg, value);
        /* Would you like fries with that? */
        hme_write32(hp, tregs + TCVR_FRAME,
                    (FRAME_WRITE | (hp->paddr << 23) |
                     ((reg & 0xff) << 18) | (value & 0xffff)));
        while (!(hme_read32(hp, tregs + TCVR_FRAME) & 0x10000) && --tries)
                udelay(20);
        /* Anything else? */
        if (!tries)
                printk(KERN_ERR "happy meal: Aieee, transceiver MIF write
bolixed\n");
        /* Fifty-two cents is your change, have a nice day. */
