That's not true. The compression and encryption support add ~1000 lines, as 
you pointed out the other day. If I moved compression and encryption support 
to userspace, I'd remove 1000 lines and:
- add more code for getting the pages copied to and from userspace
- require the user to get and build $LIBRARIES for doing the compression
- require the user to get and build $HELPER for doing the interface to 
Suspend2
- fail to leverage the perfectly good cryptoapi routines that are already 
there
- slow the whole process down because I'd now have a copy to userspace for 
every page being compressed/encrypted and a copy from userspace for every 
output page.
- make life more complicated for distro maintainers and users because they'd 
have another set of dependencies to worry about and mess with.
I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm just saying it would make suspending more 
complicated, at least potentially slower and more of a pain for everyone. On 
top of that, imagine if someone comes along and writes their own wizz-bang 
compression module, then complains (without telling you they did it) that 
Suspend2 trashed their hard disk when the bug is actually in their code. It's 
another way in which your kernel can be tainted :)

Sure. Suspending to disk is a pretty similar problem to checkpointing, except 
that you want to continue running afterwards, keep the image and modify it 
from time to time based on the changes in memory (having a checkpointing 
filesystem too, of course). My point is that modifying uswsusp to do 
checkpointing would be far harder precisely because you've pushed the highest 
level logic to userspace. It would be far more complicated, if not impossible 
for you to make the adjustments to do checkpointing.
