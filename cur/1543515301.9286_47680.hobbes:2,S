hi,
I'm sorry to bother you, but I constantly get oopses
saying "Aiiieh killing interrupt handler" and the
machine crashes.
I would like to debug the piece of code, so I came 
to ksymoops. The documentation always speaks about 
"the oops file" or similar.
where is this file ? I can't find it!
do I have to turn on some kernel compiler switches,
which one ?
it would be very nice if you would give me some hints,
thank you in advance.
 thomas
