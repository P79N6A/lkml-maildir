Tracing the problem further, it happens as soon as the init_irq (in
ide-probe.c) does the restore_flags(flags) call which reenables
interrupts.  There is no handler defined yet, but something is
causing an interrupt, so in ide.c in ide_intr, the line
if ((handler = hwgroup->handler) == NULL || hwgroup->poll_timeout != 0) {
will be true.  There is another test for a shared interrupt which I don't
know if it succeeds (but I tried bypassing the test).  That should ack
the IRQ and invoke the unexpected interrupt handler.  If it does, it
isn't having an effect.
a printk at the top of this routine is continually running, so the
interrupt is never turning off.
