It's always been broken, I think.  It results from the stub having to
sigreturn by hand because it has no access to the libc restorer, and thus 
needing to restore the stack pointer to where it was on entry.  I did this
by popping the requisite number of times.  Bodo fixed this for i386, and
I need to do something similar for x86_64.
