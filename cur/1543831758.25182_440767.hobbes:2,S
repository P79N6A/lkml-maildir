Looks nice.  For AMS, then, the userspace daemon can choose between deciding
for itself when to park heads using accel data, or to trust the firmware and
do it when told, or even to do both.
IBM *could* have done the same, since they already have an H8
microcontroller looking at that accelerometer :(  Anyway, IMHO it would be
good to have AMS-like behaviour where the kernel driver exposes head-park
events to userspace in the generic interface.
