Well, everybody has the right to make mistakes and trying to force people
not to use the official header is a big mistake.
If Linux was a complete OS and not only a Kernel and if it was always released 
with a full set of /usr/include files, libc, utilities,.... this could work.
But even then only if somebody would test the consistence of everything.
Releasing the kernel separately requires the kernel distribution to contain
a usable set of include files that match the interfaces inside the kernel.
