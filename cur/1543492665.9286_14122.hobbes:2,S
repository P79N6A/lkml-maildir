Whoa!  The size of the *random* tables is not related
to the size of the *hash* table.  Why should it be?
The sizes of the random tables depend on the number of
bits in each of the key fragments.
As I said in the original message, the values stored
in the random tables are in the range 0..PAGE_HASH_SIZE-1.
If you've been picking only smaller values, no wonder the
hash has been performing poorly!
You were earlier perfectly correct that this kind of scheme
has a large cache footprint.  On a modern processor with
a fast multiply, it would not be competitive.
