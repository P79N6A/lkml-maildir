CDROM_SEND_PACKET sounds nice, but do you have a way to:
1- Find all cdrom-ish devices in the system
2- Find if a given device is cdrom-ish
By cdrom-ish, I mean cdrom, dvdrom, cd writer, dvd writer or a
combination.
Point 1 is necessary to be a minimum user-friendly, point 2 is
necessary because you can't trust users :-)
  OG.
