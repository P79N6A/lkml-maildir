I am not a kernel or http server expert.  But is there really a reason
that a kernel based implementation would be inherently faster than the
same thing written for user space?  Here I am talking about a
specialized server, optimized to the hilt for serving static pages to a
large number of clients, with decisions about how to handle threading,
etc. made for maximum performance from the ground up, and with the
ability to hand off more complicated stuff to another "full" web
server.  On the other hand, as a module, having the *option* to use
khttpd wouldn't hurt.
