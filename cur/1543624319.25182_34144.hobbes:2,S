I'm not overly happy with this idea - there isn't anything that says an
ioport address has 4 digits.  I know of machines where an ioport address
has 8, and I'm sure on the Alpha or Sparc64 its probably 16 digits.
It might be a better solution to leave the 'port:' element as-is if
programs like kudzu rely on that label there, and just fix the missing
statistics for iomem ports.
Then file a bug against kudzu and get them to fix that so it doesn't
SEGV when it finds something it doesn't like, and teach it about the
'mem' tag.
If kudzu ignores the serinfo: line as well, that's also another kudzu
bug.
Then fix the proc interface to report a 'mem' tag for each port.
