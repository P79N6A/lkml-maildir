Why?
You really only need to know that _one_ of the entries break the 
recursion, and you need to know what the break depth is for that one 
entry.
So for example, if "c" is annotated with "max recursion: 5", then you know 
that the above loop will recurse at most 5 times.
I don't see why you need any other information.
