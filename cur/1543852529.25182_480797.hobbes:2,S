Mapping 'bidirectional' is a bit difficult.  It might be reasonable to 
interpret that as "userspace doesn't know" at lower layers, and then 
fill in a data transfer direction based on ATA command opcode.
Given that there are stupid apps/libs out there in the field with this 
behavior, even if the apps are fixed I think we are stuck with the 
stupidities.  At the very least, we could abort commands that transfer 
data in the opposite direction from indicated, based on a command opcode 
table.
