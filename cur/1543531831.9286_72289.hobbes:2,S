I was playing with the latest wine patch and I think I've found a kernel
problem.  Details are fuzzy :( Basically I ended up with several wine
zombies which wouldn't go away and I was unable to kill -9 them. Doing a
ps aux also hung the ps process and was unkillable.  I tracked this down
to ls-ing the /proc/PID dir, where PID was one of the wine zombies.  The
ls got stuck in D state.  I couldn't strace the stuck processes either,
although strace itself didn't get stuck.
I confess that I dont know entiraly what a zombie process is.  In any
case, I think that ls-ing a /proc/PID dir should never get stuck so it
looks like a bug to me...  I will try to reproduce it and get more info.
