Ah, I see. That is a different issue - converting the 32-bit dev_t
from userspace into a 32:32 internal representation.
But, a utility like mknod currently only knows about 8:8 anyway.
It needs to be patched to know about >8:>8 ... why not add
64bit (32:32) dev_t syscalls at the same time ?
I mean, if the 64 bit dev_t is not going to be exposed to userspace,
why bother with it in the kernel ? And if it /is/ going to be
exposed to userspace, why bother with a 32 bit encoding ?
Mike.
