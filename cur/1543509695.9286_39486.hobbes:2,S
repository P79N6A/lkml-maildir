It's a possibility.  Could you verify that the system is swapping, not
just discarding cached pages and re-reading them, by running 'vmstat 1'
while the system is in this state (and stopping top at some point in the
trace)?

Could you elaborate on the problems you're having so they can get fixed
allowing you to test 2.3.recent?  2.3.16+ have Andrea's LRU page cache
patch in, and as such have a much better replacement strategy for cached
data which should eliminate the behaviour you're seeing, so it would be a
very useful comparison.
