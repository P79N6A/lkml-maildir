Generally the way these patches have operated is accounting
only the interesting combinations of those with respect to
reporting in the interest of conserving space in the mm. These
have also been combined with various checks on e.g. address
ranges and some special casing of hugetlb. So it's not been
quite as simple as all that.
The code from my 2.6.0-test7-bk1 forward port of the Red Hat patches
for this was as follows:
static inline void vm_account(struct vm_area_struct *vma, pte_t pte,
					unsigned long addr, long adjustment)
{
	struct mm_struct *mm = vma->vm_mm;
	unsigned long pfn;
	struct page *page;
	if (!pte_present(pte))
		return;
	pfn = pte_pfn(pte);
	if (!pfn_valid(pfn))
		goto out;
	page = pfn_to_page(pfn);
	if (PageReserved(page))
		goto out;
	if (vma->vm_flags & VM_EXECUTABLE)
		mm->text += adjustment;
	else if (vma->vm_flags & (VM_STACK_FLAGS & (VM_GROWSUP | VM_GROWSDOWN))) {
		mm->data += adjustment;
		mm->stack += adjustment;
	} else if (addr >= TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE)
		mm->lib += adjustment;
	else
		mm->data += adjustment;
	if (page_mapping(page))
		mm->shared += adjustment;
out:
	if (pte_write(pte))
		mm->dirty += adjustment;
}
