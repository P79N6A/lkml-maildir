syscall() is an external function in glibc, not an inline.
And it saves all needed registers around it.
In fact, I don't see what you need inline syscall macro for outside of the
kernel actually. Performance critical syscalls are in libc, the rest (like
create_module) really can waste 10 additional instructions.
BTW: IMHO it is a bad idea to create _syscall_pic as new macros because on
most archs it will be the same. Instead, one should use
#ifdef __pic__
#else
#endif
in the definitions. __pic__ is defined by the compiler if you compile
-fpic/-fPIC on i386, sparc, maybe others.
Cheers,
