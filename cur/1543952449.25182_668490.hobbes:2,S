Subject: [patch 08/11] unprivileged mounts: make fuse safe
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/17/273

From: Miklos Szeredi <mszeredi@suse.cz>
Don't require the "user_id=" and "group_id=" options for unprivileged mounts,
but if they are present, verify them for sanity.
Disallow the "allow_other" option for unprivileged mounts.
Document new way of enabling unprivileged mounts for fuse.
Document problems with unprivileged mounts.

+Unprivileged fuse mounts
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
-Since the mount() system call is a privileged operation, a helper
-program (fusermount) is needed, which is installed setuid root.
+Possible problems with unprivileged fuse mounts
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+FUSE was designed from the beginning to be safe for unprivileged
+users.  This has also been verified in practice over many years, with
+some distributions enabling unprivileged FUSE mounts by default.
+
+However, there are cases when unprivileged mounting a fuse filesystem
+may be problematic, particularly for multi-user systems with untrusted
+users.  So here are few words of warning:
+
+Due to the design of the process freezer, a hanging (due to network
+problems, etc) or malicious filesystem may prevent suspending to ram
+or hibernation to succeed.  This is not actually unique to FUSE, as
+any hanging network filesystem will have the same affect.
+
+It is not always possible to use kill(2) (not even with SIGKILL) to
+terminate a process using a FUSE filesystem (see section "Interrupting
+filesystem operations" above).  As a special case of the above,
+killing a self-deadlocked FUSE process is not possible, and even
+killall5 will not terminate it.
+
+If the above could pose a threat to the system, it is recommended,
+that unprivileged fuse mounts are not enabled.
+
+Ways of enabling user mounts
+----------------------------
+
+Now there are two different ways of allowing unprivileged fuse mounts:
+
+ 1) new way: unprivileged mount syscall
+
+ 2) old way: suid-root fusermount utility
+
+Unprivileged mount syscall
+--------------------------
+
+To enable this do
+
+  echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/types/fuse/usermount_safe
+
+or add this line to /etc/sysctl.conf:
+
+  fs.types.fuse.usermount_safe = 1
+
+More information can be found in Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
+under the /proc/sys/fs/types/ heading.  Also see description of
+nr_user_mounts and max_user_mounts under /proc/sys/fs.
+
+This doesn't in itself allow users to create mounts, first root needs
+to create a mount owned by the user, under which the user can create
+submounts.
+
+For example to enable submounts under /home/xyz/mnt do:
+
+  mount --bind -ouser=xyz /home/xyz/mnt /home/xyz/mnt
+
+or add this line to /etc/fstab:
+
+  /home/xyz/mnt  /home/xyz/mnt  none  bind,user=xyz  0 0
+
+And finally, make sure, that the user has read and write permissions
+on /dev/fuse (installing fuse should have already taken care of this):
+
+  chmod 0666 /dev/fuse
+
+or create a file under /etc/udev/rules.d/ containing:
+
+  KERNEL=="fuse", MODE="0666"
+
+After this, mounting fuse filesystems under ~xyz/mnt should work, even
+if fusermount is not installed setuid-root.
+
+Suid-root fusermount utility
+----------------------------

+[Some of the details described here apply to the new, unprivileged
+mount system call as well].
