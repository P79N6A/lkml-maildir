Eric,
what you gain with this patchset is, one very simple container subsystem
can tie a container to a cpu, another can limit it's RSS, and suddenly
you can
	mount -t container -o ns,rss,cpuwhatever ns /container
And each virtual server you create by unsharing can get automatic cpu
and rss controls.
That is worthwhile imo.
