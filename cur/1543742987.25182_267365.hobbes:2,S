you've made a non-portable flags assumption:

>       ror     $8,             %r8             # (ror does not change ZF)

the contents of ZF are undefined after a rotation... most importantly they 
differ between p4 (ZF is set according to result) and k8 (ZF unchanged).
do you really measure a perf improvement from this assumption?  note that 
p4 would prefer "sub $1, %r11b" here instead of dec... but the difference 
is likely minimal.
