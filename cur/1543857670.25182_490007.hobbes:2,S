Hi,

Well, that's the most funny thing. It doesn't remount RO, it's still
mounted as RW.
Like here:
/dev/md1 on / type ext3 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
none on /sys type sysfs (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
/dev/md0 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
none on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw)
sunrpc on /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw)
/proc on /var/named/chroot/proc type none (rw,bind)
So it doesn't mount it to RO. And yes the system is just up and running.
It's a server. So it's on for 24/7. It now only happened for two times
when running the kernel 2.6.19. So it even looks like these messages are
false, because in all logs, I don't see Segfaults anywhere. And there
should be some if the error is really true what is said.
Anyway, I cannot trace back this easily as you can see.
So what can I do to help with these strange messages?
Thanks!
Jim.
