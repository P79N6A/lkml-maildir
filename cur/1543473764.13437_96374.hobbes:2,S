I had the same problem with a similar clone (I was about to replace
the card, which after all had cost less than the cable which connects
it to the wall).  I fixed it (after some fiddling around) simply by
undef'ing USE_LONGIO in drivers/net/ne2k-pci.c.
This almost certainly isn't the right thing to do; but it worked and I
forgot about it -- I know I should have reported this before!
Cheers,
