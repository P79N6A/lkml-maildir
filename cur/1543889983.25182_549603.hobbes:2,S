The outcome was, more-or-less, that we'll work on merging suspend2 or at least
some parts of it.
However, in the meantime there have been some discussions implying that we have
some important problems with suspend/hibernation that suspend2 doesn't solve
and that IMHO are more urgent than the merging of suspend2 right not.
So, as far as I'm concerned, the plan is to fix the more urgent problems first
and to work on merging suspend2 as far as there's time to do this.
The problem is there are only a few people working on it and there's a lot to
do, so I can only ask you to be patient. ;-)
Greetings,
Rafael
