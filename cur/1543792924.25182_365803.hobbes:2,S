int foo;
void bar(const int *local_var) {
     foo = *local_var + 1;
}
void show(void) {
     printf("%d\n", foo);
     bar(&foo);
     printf("%d\n", foo);

If GCC thought it could arbitrarily cache anything it wanted to, then  
code like this would die.  There is a whole mess of code in GCC  
designed specifically to watch for and avoid aliasing issues like these.

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.   
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by  
definition, not smart enough to debug it.
