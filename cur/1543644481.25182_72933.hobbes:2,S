Applied, booted, up and running.  I'll attempt to follow your work -
you are clearly way out in front of everybody in understanding this
driver.
Minor whitespace suggestion: don't worry too much about breaking up
lines to fit in 80 columns.  It's nice where it works, but where it
just makes more lines, don't bother.  We are going to go do spelling
patches to shorten a lot of those names anyway.
What test do you use to determine that some blocks are incorrectly
written?

I think you're right.  It's hard to imagine why it would be good to
optimize the module unload/reload case for DAC, and if there is a
correctness argument, I personally would rather find out about it the
hard way than never know it.

Yes, it seems a waste of effort.

Hopefully somebody with one of those will jump into the thread.  Where
in the mass of DAC init output do we look for the controller type?
