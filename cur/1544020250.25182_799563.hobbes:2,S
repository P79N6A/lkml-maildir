in this area there's a pet pieve of mine, or rather something that
shows up on kerneloops.org quite a bit:
There are several PCI quirks that get run with irqs off, but they are
just the "normal" boot time quirks, and when they get run there, they
can sleep. Some of them do things like call ioremap() and the like....
from memory some of the asus and via quirks come to mind...
