Hello,
this patch updates the av7110 (full-featured DVB-S/C/T cards) and the 
budget (Transport-Stream (TS) only cards) driver.
Fixed problems for both:
- replaced ddelay() wait function with generic dvb_delay() implementation
Fixed stuff for av7110:
- new DATA_MPEG_VIDEO_EVENT for direct mpeg2 video playback
- added support for DVB-C cards with MSP3400 mixer and analog tuner
- fixed up the av7110_ir handler and especially the write_proc() 
function; this fixed the bug the Stanford Checker has found
Please review and apply.
Thanks
Michael Hunold.
