I wasn't able to get MIDI working too, I guess that these onboard sound
cards doesn't have support for it (but I really don't know).
The random noise could be caused by wrong mixer setting. Try save mixer
settings when you are using OSS, and restore them while running ALSA
(you can use oss-preserve for it).
