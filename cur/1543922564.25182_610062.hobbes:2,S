which is what i meant, sorry for not being more clear
anyways, this is all moot ... we dont want "always inline" nor do we
want "static inline" for our string functions.  we want the classical
GNU meaning of "extern inline" which means we're going to either have
a Blackfin specific "extern_inline" define or we get one added to the
common compiler headers and use that.
Peter (or is it "H. Peter" ?): you going to post a patch or should i ?
