Subject: [patch 0/3] x86-64 memory hotplug support and fixups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Following this mail are three memory hotplug patches.  The first
two are trivial patches that merely remove warnings in the 1)ACPI
memory hotplug driver and 2) sparsemem code - these do not affect
functionality in either case.  The third patch includes x86-64
specific support for memory hot-add on single node (non-NUMA)
systems. These changes are specifically isolated to the arch.  
Patches are against linux-2.6.15-rc5.  I've tested the x86-64 
memory hotplug patch for logical and physical hot-add operations. 
Please review and consider queuing this one to -mm for additional
testing.  Thanks...
