As I said before, if it's just for you and your friends, and you
understand the pitfalls, then fine (of course, then patches to the
official kernel aren't appropriate).
If you're providing this for others, then I think you've doing them a
disservice, because you're giving something that looks really nice,
but has too many hidden traps.

It is my view that DSM is not an appropriate model for most classes of
real applications. DIPC minus the DSM bit is a different story. But
then we're talking about MPI. I've got no problems with MPI (not that
I've used it, since I've got my own API).
