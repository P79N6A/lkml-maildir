That's an excellent problem description.  I'm just a bit hazy on how the
patch fixes it. :)
What is the actual error in this loop?  The fact that we can go trying
to free pages when the count is actually OK?
BTW, try_to_free_low(count) kinda sucks for a function name.  Is that
count the number of pages we're trying to end up with, or the total
number of low pages that we're trying to free?
Also, as I look at try_to_free_low(), why do we need to #ifdef it out in
the case of !HIGHMEM?  If we have CONFIG_HIGHMEM=yes, we still might not
have any _actual_ high memory.  So, they loop obviously doesn't *hurt*
when there is no high memory.

The real problem with this line is that "count" is too ambiguous. :)
We could rewrite the original max() line this way:
	if (resv_huge_pages > nr_of_pages_to_end_up_with)
		nr_of_pages_to_end_up_with = resv_huge_pages;
	try_to_make_the_total_nr_of_hpages(nr_of_pages_to_end_up_with);
Which makes it more clear that you're setting the number of total pages
to the number of reserved pages, which is obviously screwy.
OK, so this is actually saying: "count can never go below
resv_huge_pages+nr_huge_pages"?
Could we change try_to_free_low() to free a distinct number of pages?
	if (count > free_huge_pages)
		count = free_huge_pages;
	try_to_free_nr_huge_pages(count);
I feel a bit sketchy about the "resv_huge_pages + nr_huge_pages -
free_huge_pages" logic.  Could you elaborate a bit there on what the
rules are?
