Bear in mind that syslogd only keeps timestamps to second resolution.
That isn't really useful for debugging races. Even microsecond
resolution can be insufficient for debugging races (these days there
are a lot of cycles per microsecond). Printing timestamps with
microsecond or better resolution would just get incredibly message.
I don't think the timestamps help much.
