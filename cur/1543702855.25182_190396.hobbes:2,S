Two things to try:
1. Check your HD with hdparm -I /dev/hdX, and see what it says at the 
"Standby timer values:" entry. Mine says:
Standby timer values: spec'd by Standard, with device specific minimum
In fact, when I set my HD to spin down in 20 seconds, it never spins 
down -- it's below the minimum. Try a higher value, or use my 
smart_spindown script instead (I posted this a while ago, with one of 
the laptop_mode patches).
2. Stop klogd, do "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump" and see which 
process keeps your disk spun up using dmesg.
Let me know if this helps.
