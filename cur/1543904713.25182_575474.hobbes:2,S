This issue wandered off onto a long thread "build fix for x86_64" which
died out without a final patch.  Here's the summary:
> +#if defined(CONFIG_X86_64) || (defined(CONFIG_IA64) && defined(CONFIG_COMPAT))
It was pointed out that x86-64 also has a CONFIG_COMPAT, so the "right"
#ifdef mess would be:
#if defined(CONFIG_COMPAT) && (defined(CONFIG_IA64) || defined(CONFIG_X86_64))
But this was thought too ugly.  Andi Kleen proposed making a new CONFIG
variable for this situation: CONFIG_COMPAT_FOR_U64_ALIGMNENT which could
be set in ia64 and x86-64 Kconfig files with:
config COMPAT_FOR_U64_ALIGMNENT
	def_bool COMPAT
So the C-code would simply have:
#if defined(COMPAT_COMPAT_FOR_U64_ALIGMNENT)
(IIRC the syntax correctly).  Peter Anvin had some worries about future
issues ... but I think he agreed that this was Ok.
Anyone still have any objections to this?
