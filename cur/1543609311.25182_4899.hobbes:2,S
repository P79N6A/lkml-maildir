   	i'm not sure about the enable_tasklet bit. I think it will prevent
   people from calling tasklet_enable from within an interrupt handler. But then
   again, why do you want to do that? Thanx, velco and
   	Any comments?
I've been looking at this and I sent Andrea+Linus private mail on this
to try and work out a fix.
You can't simply stop enabling the softirq when you hit the "locked
tasklet" condition.  That could deadlock the tasklet.
What really needs to happen is:
1) If tasklet is scheduled, but disabled, simply ignore it
   during tasklet processing.  Do not resignal softirq.
   But do leave it on the pending lists.
2) When tasklet enable brings t->count back to zero and
   tasklet is found to be scheduled, signal a local softirq.
To me, that would be the proper fix.  But I still haven't heard back
from Andrea or Linus yet :-)
Franks a lot,
