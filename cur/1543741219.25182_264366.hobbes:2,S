Andrea, I'm confused by your response.
Are you suggesting one or more of:
1. BK has improved LK workflow
2. BK has not improved LK workflow
3. BK has had no impact on LK workflow
4. you hate the license
Any of these or something else?
If your answer does not include 1, why?
I've read 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3148
>From my view, LK workflow post patch penguin (ie: BK)
is improved simply because fewer patches seem to be lost.
I too do not use BK because of the license restrictions
on developing any other SCM systems.  I think that portion
of the license is just wrong, but BK is BitMover's product
and I believe Larry can license it as he chooses.
