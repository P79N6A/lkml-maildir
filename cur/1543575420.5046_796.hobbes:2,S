HI!
 I have 2.4.0-test9 and 2.2.16 kernel compiled on my computer .I have
httpd server on this computer . With 2.2.16 apache work good ( via DSL
and modem ), but with 2.4 ( the same computer ) , when I wont to connect
to my page via modem first few kilobytes are downloaded "fast" and then
connection slow down and transfer rate is 1byte per second . When I
download this page from linux ( via modem ) everything is ok ! I have
this problem , when I want to see this this page from MS Windows
computers only via ppp connection . I have tested it on two different
computer and result is the same .
