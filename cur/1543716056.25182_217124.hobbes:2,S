It should be OK - after writepages completes the inode-level writeback code
will inspect BDI_write_congested and will propagate that into the
writeback_control for the top-level writeback code to ponder.
The pdflush silliness has been seen on smbfs and reiserfs too, so...
It looks like the problem is that the inode is stuck on the superblock's
s_io list, and we keep calling writepage(s) and writepage(s) keeps on
redirtying the page rather than writing it.  If so, moving the page off
s_io should fix it up.
