You're just supporting the point of view that Linus has been espousing, and 
I personally support:  Linux is engineered at a micro level[1] but evolves
on its own at a macro level.
Sure, Linux evolves with help from Linus, but he acts as a filter, not a 
designer.  When Linus does on rare occasions forget himself and actually 
design something, its micro-engineering like you or I would do.  So if Linux 
is designed, who does do the designing, can you name him?  I can tell you for 
sure it's not Linus.

Don't worry about me drinking the cool aid, first I already drank it and 
second I'm personally already fully devoted to the notion of design process, 
including all the usual steps:  blue sky, discussion, requirements, data 
design, detail design, prototype, etc. etc.  You'll find the 'paper trails' 
in the archives if you've got the patience to go spelunking, and you'll have 
a hard time finding one of those designs that became a dead end.  This design 
thing does work for me.  It doesn't change the fact that what I'm doing is 
micro-engineering.
I'll get really worried if Linus wakes up one day and decides that from now 
on he's going to properly engineer every aspect of the Linux kernel.  The 
same way I'd feel if Linux got taken over by a committee.
