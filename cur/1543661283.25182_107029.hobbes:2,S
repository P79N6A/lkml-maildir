I don't agree with this. Simply, why to activate devices which will not be
ever used? You'll occupy resources which can be assigned to another
device. Also, you simply removed my configuration templates, so the driver
cannot tell explicitly which resources PnP layer should assign. Also
activation (and resource allocation) should be on request allowing driver
to do things manually. Bad bad bad. We're again in state a month ago when
nothing worked and ALSA ISA PnP drivers are still broken, because your
model doesn't have all features like good old ISA PnP code. Also, with all
respects, I think that you're trying to write very clever code. It's also
bad. It will end with numerous problems and with undeterministic behaviour
like unnamed commercial OS. Let users to pass their own configurations.
