Patches 1-3 are fine.
Protocol switching via sysfs works too but if I switch from LBPS/2 to
PS/2 the device name changes from "/dev/event1" to "/dev/event2" -- is
this intended?
If I do "echo -n 50 > resolution" "0xe8 0x01" is sent. I don't know if
this is correct for "usual" PS/2-devices but for the lifebook it's
wrong.
For the lifebook the parameters are as following:
50cpi  <=> 0x00
100cpi <=> 0x01
200cpi <=> 0x02
400cpi <=> 0x03
