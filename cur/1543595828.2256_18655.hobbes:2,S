Correct, but all pages are not equal.
The problem with updatedb is that it pushes all applications to the swap,
and when you get back in the morning, everything has to be paged back from
swap just because the (stupid) OS is prepared for yet another updatedb
run.
Other bad activities include copying lots of files, tar/untar:ing and CD
writing.  They all cause unwanted paging, at least for the desktop user.
