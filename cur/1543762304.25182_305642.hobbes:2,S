For x86, the atomic op is a barrier, but not for other architectures.
You don't need a barrier in the else branch, because in that case
you are already in an enclosing RCU read-side critical section, so
any bleeding of code will be into this enclosing section, thus still
safe.

Let me make sure I understand the sequence of events:
	CPU#1				CPU#2
	task1: rcu_read_lock()
	task1: migrate to CPU#2
					task1: call_rcu()
					task1: rcu_read_unlock()
This sequence will be safe because CPU#1's active_readers field will
be non-zero throughout, so that CPU#1 will refuse to record any
quiescent state from the time that task1 does the rcu_read_lock()
on CPU#1 until the time that it does the rcu_read_unlock() on CPU#2.
Now, it is true that CPU#2 might record a quiescent state during this
time, but this will have no effect because -all- CPUs must pass through
a quiescent state before any callbacks will be invoked.  Since CPU#1
is refusing to record a quiescent state, grace periods will be blocked
for the full extent of task 1's RCU read-side critical section.
Or am I misunderstanding your scenario?  Or, for that matter, your code?

This would work too, but I don't believe it is necessary given what
you are already doing.

Well, I do believe that suppressing migration of tasks during RCU read-side
critical sections would simplify the flip-pointers/counters code.  But
that is easy to say in advance of actually producing this code.  ;-)
