Hi Dewet.

The relevant mount option is to specify the ext3 rather than the ext2
file system, and the flag you refer to gets set if ANYBODY sets the
"COMPRESS THIS FILE" flag on ANY file on that file system. As far as I
can tell, nothing ever resets that flag, even if the last file that
was compressed gets uncompressed.
I suggested a while back that fsck should check whether there are any
compressed files on the filesystem, and reset that flag if not, but as
far as I can tell, nothing was ever done to implement that suggestion.

You have an old version of tune2fs, and need to get the one that knows
about ext3 or alternatively apply the patch that was distributed some
time ago and recompile - I'm not sure which.
Stephen: What's the current status regarding tune2fs and ext3, I'm a
tad out of date in this respect?

That might help...
Best wishes from Riley.
