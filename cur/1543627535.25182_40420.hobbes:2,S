Hi,
	Because the type of brlock_read_lock_t can vary depending on
whether SPINLOCK_DEBUG is defined, I suspect that the initialisation
of __brlock_array in lib/brlock.c is incorrect.
I suspect the initialisation in the __BRLOCK_USE_ATOMICS case whould
be to RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED, not zero.  Otherwise, nasty things will happen
-- and wakeups may be missed on i386 (the rwlock_t should be initialised to
-MAXINT-1 for i386, not zero, as the transition from negative->positive
is used to trigger wakeups.  Other architectures have other requirements)
