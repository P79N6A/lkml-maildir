Uhm, it looks to me that you ran qemu with the -kernel option again (I 
can tell because the dump exhibits a few bugs that are characteristic of 
the qemu loader.)  This makes qemu itself load the kernel and not rely 
on the boot loader that's on your bootloader.
I was expecting you to run "qemu -S -s -hda /dev/hda -snapshot", which 
you previously said when run (without the -S -s) options reproduced the 
problem.
After taking the dump, please do:
	delete
	c
... to verify the problem is reproduced.
Thanks,
	-hpa
