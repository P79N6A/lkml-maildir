So it looks like we have this tracked and fixed.  Andrew included my
fix in:
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/2.6.16-rc5-mm2-pre1.gz
So just confirming that the fixed actually worked would probably be
the biggest help.
The problem should be fixed unless there is something else that
triggers the horrible and mysterious kernel death.  So you are
getting the same results as everyone else.
