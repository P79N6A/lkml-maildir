Ok, I applied Jens's patch, rmmod sg, rmmod cdrom, and retest "tstdvd".
This time, debug still shows the same "Illegal Request", BUT the drive
successfully authenticated.
I tried the following command, but still couldn't get scsi log ...
echo "scsi log error,scan,mlqueue,mlcomplete,llqueue,llcomplete,hlqueue,hlcomplete 9"
>/proc/scsi/scsi
Thanks,
Jeff
