RT signals work fine with clone()ed processes.

We've got that already in libpthread, and it would be easy enough to
transport over to liblthread if you wanted.

No technical problems there.

Maybe the community should sit down and hammer out the following
points, once and for all:
- do we actually need efficient (POSIX compliant) pthreads for Linux
- is there a solution to the pthreads/kernel problem that Linus will
  accept
- what is the cost of such solutions to the kernel and what complexity
  does it bring
- would an efficient lthread implementation provide an acceptable
  alternative for those who care more about speed than portability?
On the last point, it's worth noting that every vendor has had their
own threads API, and people have used it. In my own code, I've made
use of IRIX's native sproc(2), Solaris Threads and Linux's
clone(2). Sure, it's a bit ugly having all those #ifdefs, but it
works, and my code is portable.
What, I hear you ask. How is it portable? Simple: my applications use
my wrapper layer. What matters to me is that I've had threaded
applications for over 5 years. If I had to wait for vendors to
implement and debug pthreads, I'd only now be shipping threaded
applications.
Even now, I still retain my hooks to the native interfaces, because
there are plenty of installed systems which don't have pthreads. Not
everyone will or can install the latest OS version from the vendor.
If we come up with something like Solaris Threads, which is almost
identical to pthreads, then you can hide the details in a bunch of
macros. Of course, lthreads would be more different, since we'd drop
the process/thread distinction, but for a lot of threaded
applications, *that doesn't matter*!

We *are* following the standard. Or at least, pthreads in Linux is
supposed to. It's just that the efficiency isn't that good. I see no
reason we can't have both: pthreads for compliance, and lthreads for
speed.
