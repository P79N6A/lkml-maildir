The simplest solution is to keep wall-time maintained in a timespec as
well as the nsec_t based system_time/wall_time_offset combo. This avoids
the extra add in the hotpath, and only costs an extra add at interrupt
time.
I'll have an updated patch that includes some of Roman's suggestions
from earlier soon.

Many arches have userspace gtod implementations (x86-64, ppc64, and ia64
as well). Although my timeofday code allows for this as well (I had it
working for x86-64 awhile back).
