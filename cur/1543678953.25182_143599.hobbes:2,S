I think it's a reasonable request.  It's a pity that the future work on
the Orinoco driver won't be integrated into your driver automatically.  In
particular, scanning, monitor mode and switching to the separate wireless
handlers may be useful for the USB driver as well.
But indeed, Orinoco USB is very different from other Orinoco cards.  There
is a firmware that stands between the driver and the PCMCIA card, and that
firmware is less transparent than, say, PLX bridges.
It's a tough call, and it's up to you to make.

I don't know what happened to rtl8139/8139too but I think the situation is
different from your description.  Unless you are going to make more
development on Orinoco USB than David Gibson does on Orinoco, the Orinoco
USB is not going to be the development version.  Besides, the drivers
support different hardware, so there is no choice for users.
As far as I know, Orinoco USB devices are quite rare, so the pool of
testers is going to be small compared to the standard Orinoco driver that
supports Symbol and Intersil cards as well.

If you are going to create a separate driver, you should rename the
module.  I wouldn't bother with separate modules.  Just link hermes,
orinoco and orinoco_usb to one driver, say orinoco-usb.
You may also need to rename all files if you want the driver to live in
drivers/net/wireless rather than in drivers/usb/net.
That's of course assumes that you want to use separate versions of
hermes.c and orinoco.c.  But maybe you want to share them with the Orinoco
driver now or in the future?  Then I'd like to know about your plans.

That's a separate and very interesting topic.  It's good to encourage
developers to write for the current development kernel, but on the other
hand, if kcompat.h is shared between all drivers, changes in it (caused
by further changes in 2.5.x API) would break drivers in the stable
kernels.
Perhaps backported drivers should not share their compatibility code
unless there is some kind of coordination between their maintainers.
