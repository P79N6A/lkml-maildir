Yes thats what I thought.

lock_cpu_hotplug() in sched_getaffinity was supposed to guard from
reading the wrong value you point out. But with recent churn of cpu hotplug 
locking, this is broken now.
Ideally, lock_cpu_hotplug() should have taken something equivalent to 
cpu_add_remove_lock (breaking cpufreq in the course :), but moving 
mutex_lock(&cpu_bitmask_lock) few lines above (before set_cpus_allowed) should 
also work in this case.
Alternately, taking a per-subsystem lock in DOWN_PREPARE/LOCK_ACQUIRE 
notifications, which is used by sched_getaffinity also, would work 
(as you note below).

CPU_DOWN_PREPARE is a good enough time to acquire the (scheduler
subsystem) lock. But I am more concerned about when we release that lock. 
Releasing at CPU_DEAD/CPU_DOWN_FAILED is too early, since the tasks's 
cpus_allowed mask would not have been restored by then. Thats why having a 
separate notification to release (and acquire) the lock would make more sense I 
thought.
