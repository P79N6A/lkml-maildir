Some discussions on this thread made me more
curiuos... (sorry if that's a really dumb question).
I see that the text section of executable files
or shared objects is mmapped as private.
# cat /proc/$$/maps 
08048000-0808d000 r-xp 00000000 03:05 2036       /bin/bash
0808d000-08092000 rw-p 00044000 03:05 2036       /bin/bash
08092000-080a7000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
...
Will pages that are not modified still be shared?
If swapping takes place, will clean pages go to the swap
space or are they simply discarded (and reloaded
on demand from the file?
