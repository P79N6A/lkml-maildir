I think I may have found a bug in Kernel 2.4.19.   I am working on a
project that makes use of RAM disks.  In kernel 2.4.18, I am able to
create RAM disks using the /dev/ram devices.  Building a 2.4.19 kernel
using make oldconfig and not selecting any new options, limits me to only
being able to build a single RAM disk.  Regardless of what device I
instruct the box to use, it always trys to use /dev/ram0.  I am not a
kernel hacker by any means, but have tracked it down to 2.4.19 being the
only thing different when my system acts up.   I am not subscribed to the
mailing list, so please CC replies to me, thank you.
