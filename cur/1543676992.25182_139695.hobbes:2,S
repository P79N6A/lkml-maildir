Why are journaling filesystems only for servers?
Is file system efficiency not relevant on servers?
The important sections are more likely (ordered by priority):
- bug fixes (e.g. aic7xxx)
- support for additional hardware (e.g. ACPI update)
- new features (e.g. XFS)
These groups are not mutual exclusive, e.g. the ACPI update also 
includes new features.
The important thing is that this is inside a stable kernel series and an 
update that makes things better for 100 people but makes things worse 
for one person is IMHO bad since it's a regression for one person.
