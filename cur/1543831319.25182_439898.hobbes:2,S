Well, from the web page referenced at the top of this message, you
can see that they are already aware of these issues:
Cons:
    *      It breaks current upstream kernel builds and potentially
other direct usages of gcc. Kernel is by far the most important use
case. Upstream should change the default options to build with
-fno-stack-protector by default.
    *      It is not conformant to upstream gcc behaviour.
You can reach the key people who are working on this for Ubuntu here:
Matt Zimmerman -- mdz at ubuntu dot com
Martin Pitt -- martin.pitt at ubuntu dot com
Perhaps you can convince them to back out this functional change?
Does this mean that you don't want to see these fno-stack-protector
patches go into Andrew's tree?
