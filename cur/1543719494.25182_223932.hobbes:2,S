So it seems that the 2.6.x geometry code breaks dual booting, since 
Windows wants "sane" CHS values.  See the thread on slashdot, or 
http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2004-May/msg00908.html
Although Fedora Core is current taking grief for this, it's really a 
2.6.x kernel problem AFAICT.
Has anybody taken the time to hunt down the csets that cause this 
massive partition table breakage?  If so, it will save me some time 
tracking this down.
