I have code that has been running MPI NBPs, Pallas benchmark, and IPoIB
stress tests
for almost 10 days now on multiple vendors equipment. We are also close
to having
a major data base vendor's DAPL stress test running very well.  I'm
thinkin this code could be
running 1000 nodes clusters within a couple of months, if people wanted
to try it,
but that would require Mellanox to open source their TVPD.

The comments you have given on IBAL would probably only take a few weeks
to change.

Ok, the OEMS pushed for and got a distro to accept a TTM solution,
that's OK for getting
InfiniBand jumpstarted, 
but does that mean we have to accept it into Linux 
and live with that solution forever. 
I guess I just wish they had started working with us on this open source
project 2 years ago
when we started it, rather than developing a complete stack behind
closed doors and then
releasing it without any input from anyone. Now there are serious issues
that will take a lot 
of work to fix. At least our project was totally open from the 
start and anyone could have provided input at any time. 
Enough said.
I understand your position.  We will submit our code to openib.org.
