Subject: gettimeofday order of magnitude slower with pmtimer, which is default

Hi everybody,
For my open source nameserver (
http://www.powerdns.com
) I need to do quite a
number of gettimeofday calls. I've pared it down to almost the bare minimum
of 1 gettimeofday per packet sent and received. With these calls, I can make
stats like 
http://ds9a.nl/tmp/rrd/
 which my users need so they can verify
the proper performance of the nameserver.
Yesterday, together with Zwane, I discovered each gettimeofday call costs me
4 usec on some boxes and almost nothing on others. We did a fruitless chase
for vsyscall/sysenter happening but the problem turned out to be
CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER.
This problem has been discussed before
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0411.1/2135.html
Not only is the pm timer slow by design, it also needs to be read multiple
times to work around a bug in certain hardware.
What is new is that this option is now dependent on CONFIG_EMBEDDED. Unless
you select this option, the PM Timer will always be used.
Would a patch removing the link to EMBEDDED and adding a warning that while
this timer is of high quality, it is slow, be welcome?
Thanks.
