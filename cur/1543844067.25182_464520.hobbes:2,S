Ugh, yes that's somewhat problematic. It does seem rather unlikely that
there's a function call in the function prologue when we're busy 
offloading stuff onto the stack, but still ...
For the cases where we're prepared to overwrite the call instruction in
the caller, rather than insert an extra jump in the callee, can we not
do that atomically by overwriting the address we're jumping to (the
call is obviously there already)? Doesn't fix function pointers, etc,
but might work well for the simple case at least.
