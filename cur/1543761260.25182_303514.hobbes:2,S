Hi Christoph,
Do you have profile data from your modification? Which percentage of the 
allocations is node-local, which percentage is from foreign nodes? 
Preferably per-cache. It shouldn't be difficult to add statistics 
counters to your patch.
And: Can you estaimate which percentage is really accessed node-local 
and which percentage are long-living structures that are accessed from 
all cpus in the system?
I had discussions with guys from IBM and SGI regarding a numa allocator, 
and we decided that we need profile data before we can decide if we need 
one:
- A node-local allocator reduces the inter-node traffic, because the 
callers get node-local memory
- A node-local allocator increases the inter-node traffic, because 
objects that are kfree'd on the wrong node must be returned to their 
home node.

This line is quite slow, and should be performed only for NUMA builds, 
not for non-numa builds. Some kind of wrapper is required.

This line is very dangerous: Every wrong-node allocation causes a 
spin_lock operation. I fear that the cache line traffic for the spinlock 
might kill the performance for some workloads. I personally think that 
batching is required, i.e. each cpu stores wrong-node objects in a 
seperate per-cpu array, and then the objects are returned as a block to 
their home node.

You have moved the cache spinlock into the l3 structure. Have you 
compared both approaches?
A global spinlock has the advantage that batching is possible in 
free_block: Acquire global spinlock, return objects to all nodes in the 
system, release spinlock. A node-local spinlock would mean less 
contention [multiple spinlocks instead of one global lock], but far more 
spin_lock/unlock calls.
IIRC the conclusion from our discussion was, that there are at least 
four possible implementations:
- your version
- Add a second per-cpu array for off-node allocations. __cache_free 
batches, free_block then returns. Global spinlock or per-node spinlock. 
A patch with a global spinlock is in
http://www.colorfullife.com/~manfred/Linux-kernel/slab/patch-slab-numa-2.5.66
per-node spinlocks would require a restructuring of free_block.
- Add per-node array for each cpu for wrong node allocations. Allows 
very fast batch return: each array contains memory just from one node, 
usefull if per-node spinlocks are used.
- do nothing. Least overhead within slab.
I'm fairly certains that "do nothing" is the right answer for some 
caches. For example the dentry-cache: The object lifetime is seconds to 
minutes, the objects are stored in a global hashtable. They will be 
touched from all cpus in the system, thus guaranteeing that 
kmem_cache_alloc returns node-local memory won't help. But the added 
overhead within slab.c will hurt.
