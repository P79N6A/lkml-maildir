Argh... This is going to take some getting used to.  Why would ALPS not
have multi-finger detection?  That was such a cool feature.  gpm seems
to be having problems getting the tapping thing right though but I
should most probably just rtfm a bit more :).
btw Dmitri, that patch does not seem to work.  But the kernel panic that
kicks in when X starts up does imply that _something_ changed.  No sync
however, so no stack trace in the logs either.  In fact, looking at the
dmesg part of those two boot attempts the serio i8042 driver doesn't
even manage to find the KBD or AUX ports (No keyboard or mouse).
I can do more trouble shooting at a later point.  For now I'll just use
"i8042.nomux=1 usb-handoff" to boot with.  Thanks for the effort.
Jaco
