Ack.
There are some other similar problems still in /proc.
In my pid namespace work I have some managed to clean most of
this up, and finally split proc into two filesystems.
The only was I was able to get the union to work was
to let lookup return files in an internal mount.
The only problem was that /proc/irq/..  != /proc/
I will finish all of this up shortly but do you know a good
way to do a union mount when we mount proc?
