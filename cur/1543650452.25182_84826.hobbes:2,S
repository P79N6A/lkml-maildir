Okay, _may_ block. That's what I needed to know. So it's not a kernel
bug, but a bug in applications like socket(1) and nc(1).
With squid I see corrupted downloads, that probably means squid does
use non-blocking sockets but doesn't handle short writes correctly.

Thanks for the clarification.
Now I must go fix all those programs :/
