Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
the following patch corrects a bug where rmap would continue
trying to swap out a page even after it failed on one pte,
which could result in leaked pte chains and a bug when exiting
applications which use mlock().
The bug was tracked down by Christian Ehrhardt, the reason
it wasn't found earlier was a subtlety in the code, so I've
taken the liberty of changing Christian's patch into something
more explicit, we shouldn't let this one happen again ;)
please apply,
Rik
