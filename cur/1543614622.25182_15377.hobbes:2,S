OK, cool, just checking.  We're on the same page.

I think it is important to distinguish between BK and CVS.  CVS can't do 
what you want, BK can.
People can't have write access in CVS for the obvious reasons, the tree
becomes a chaotic mess of stuff that hasn't been filtered.  But in BK,
because each workspace is a repository, people inherently have write
access to *their* repository.  So they get SCM.  And they may eventually
get their stuff into your tree if you ever accept the changeset.
There are problems with this, BK isn't perfect, but it is much closer 
to solving the set of problems you are describing that CVS can ever 
hope to be.

Yes, and it works great for easy merges.  It sucks for complicated merges.
BK can help you a great deal with those merges.
