I have a vague recollection that at one point I disabled IDE-SCSI requests 
with lun != zero on the assumption that IDE devices with multiple LUNs didn't 
exist.
I assume that someone found a counter-example? If so, could we use a whitelist 
of targets known to have multiple LUNs, and default to blocking requests with 
lun != 0?
