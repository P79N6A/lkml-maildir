Do we?

It's already there for Linux. It's just that you have to
merge it yourself.
RR:
Some people have different opinions about what constitutes
a good filesystem. One half goes with ext, the other with
<CENSORED>, mainly because "it works" for them, has "proven
to be stable enough", "<CENSORED> has not proven to be
stable", or perhaps just out of fs beliefs/conviction.
I myself would not 'want' either zfs or r4 at this time,
and there's even an objective reason behind it.
