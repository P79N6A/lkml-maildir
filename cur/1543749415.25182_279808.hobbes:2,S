Yes, it's expected that you rebuild the kernel
(at least all affected files), then reboot that
kernel to use the new syscall.
OTOH, there has been some recent email on lkml about
dynamic syscalls and a way to allow them (mostly for
experimental use AIUI, but if that's the case, just
rebuilding and rebooting would probably do for most
people).
