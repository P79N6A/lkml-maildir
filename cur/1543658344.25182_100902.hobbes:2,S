Subject: PATCH: "enumeration value not handled in switch" in pcm_native.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/7/81

sound/core/pcm_native.c has a few switch statements where
SNDRV_PCM_STATE_LAST is not handled. Add a 'default' case which
perserves the current semantics but silences the compiler up. Patch is
against 2.5.54-bk.
