Considering the example Sam quoted, doesn't it make sense to split
resource classes (some of them atleast) independent of each other?
That would also argue for providing multiple hierarchy feature in Paul's
patches.
Given that and the mail Serge sent on why nsproxy optimization is
usefull given numbers, can you reconsider your earlier proposals as
below:
	- pid_ns and resource parameters should be in a single struct
	  (point 1c, 7b in [1])
	- pointers to resource controlling objects should be inserted
	  in task_struct directly (instead of nsproxy indirection)
	  (points 2c in [1])
