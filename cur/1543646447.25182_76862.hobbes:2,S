Hi FD, thks for joining the party ;)
Thks for the pointers -- now I know how to patch my kernel =)
So, are you effectively able to rip audio tracks with 2.4.20-pre8ac3 or
did you just mean that it is stable (in general)? Do you have the same
mobo I have (or another one also based on VIA VT8233 Southbridge)?
TIA,
Andre
