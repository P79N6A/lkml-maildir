Why? Linux historically required always some changes to port programs
(e.g. UDP or accept error behaviour), one socket option more for some
very special cases is not too bad.

The other guy unfortunately did not describe how exactly the java
fails, so I cannot say what is worse.

LD_PRELOAD for binary only programs, patches for free software.

Analy compliant java can use the setsockopt without LD_PRELOAD.

I don't understand why (3) is such a big problem for you.  It strikes
me as clean enough.  You can still have the sysctl, just the application
should be able to overwrite it.
