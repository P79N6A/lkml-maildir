You are free to perfect anyone's commit log in essence - i do it for 90% 
of all commits that go via -tip. I fix tyops and grammar mistaiks in every 
second commit, and have to fix basic formatting, structure, explanations 
and reported-by credits and tags in most of them. Submitting patches with 
a well-structured commit log gives you extra credit :-)
[ Obviously you are not free to make a commit log worse and then make it 
  appear as if the guy who submitted it did it ;-) ]
