For process zero, for thread quite high on x86 because you
would need per CPU page tables. Doing that would be extremly
nasty because you would potentially need to allocate a new
set of page tables every time the process is scheduled to a new
CPU it hasn't run on before.
If you limit it to a process then you can't get the current CPU
from such a mapping because a process can run threaded on
multiple CPUs.
My reference was more to high suggestion of keeping a second version 
of task_struct for export. That would require changing everything
in task struct that is changed on switch_to and should be exported
in the other function too.
