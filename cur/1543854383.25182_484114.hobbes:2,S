please use the "-u" option for diff; that's the preferred (only) form
the Linux kernel folks are used to looking at diffs, and applying them.
Also, it's very helpful and customary to also pass the "-p" option (this
improves the context so that reviews are easier)
would you mind redoing the diff and then resending it?
Thanks!
