Hmpf, I played with the idea to keep track of the seek pointer in
userland by writing a wrapper-library between an app and glibc.
The library replaces "lseek/write" combinations by pwrite and
the same for writev(,,1). It's a totally different idea but
great to reduce the number of syscalls.

It is part of a full autoconf/automake/libtool distribution for
that but it would need a cleanup (at least one person here knows why...).
Contact me to force a cleanup, it's hard to get it up without config.h ;-}
but you should see the (cool ?) idea behind it.
It keeps the linux-specific optimizing stuff out of your source.
