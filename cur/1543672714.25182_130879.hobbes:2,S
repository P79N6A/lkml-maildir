Sorry, I remember your solution now.  You're absolutely right (still).
I preferred the "include/exclude" flag, which covers the "what to do
when cpus come online/go offline" as well as the size issue, but
that's personal preference.
However, I shall dutifully attack the glibc people for this, then
(/usr/include/sched.h):
#ifdef __USE_GNU
/* Set the CPU affinity for a task */
extern int sched_setaffinity (__pid_t __pid, unsigned long int __len,
			      unsigned long int *__mask) __THROW;
/* Get the CPU affinity for a task */
extern int sched_getaffinity (__pid_t __pid, unsigned long int __len,
			      unsigned long int *__mask) __THROW;
#endif
Thanks!
Rusty.
