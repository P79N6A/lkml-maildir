Now that we've established that SDRAM doesn't neccisarily get erased from 
rebooting, does anyone know how long it takes for SDRAM to clear after 
losing power? It seems to me that the fact that the RAM isn't neccisarily 
wiped by the BIOS at boot is less important than wether or not shutting 
down the system and having it shut down for 10 minutes causes the RAM to 
be cleared so that any intruder/thief would be unable to get the 
information neccisary to decrypt the swap...
