Sure something is. APIC is broken for you, right ? As it's for
me - see
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107721911802649&w=2
Yes, it'd be nice to get it working without ACPI, but it's an
improvement that ACPI now works (also in 2.4.25).
But you wrote "This happens about once every 3 hours.", so it
doesn't seem to be completely broken as it's for me.
