In your query to LKML on 2 Jul 02 re: Initio ini9100
Why do you think proc/fs support would help?
Expand on tape problem (after chanting 1000 times "all tape drives aspire
to become as one with /dev/null").
What kernel version are you using?
Which kernel version worked successfully last?
I run a INI-A100U2W with kernels 2.2.x, 2.4.x and 2.5.25
What SCSI version does the Seagate need? U, UW, U2W or 160
