Notice the originally poster uses the make O=dir syntax - visible from the include2
directory being present on the commandline.
This issue is kbuild related. When using 'make O=dir' syntax kbuild process
options passed to gcc, and all -Isomething are processed.
Whitin the limits of the make syntax it it not easy to handle -I something.
When I originally implemented this I grepped the kernel and did not
find any uses of -I something, but only -Isomething.
I may easy have overlooked one.
And to the easy answer: fix kbuild.
If anyone can see a way to fix this using make syntax please let me know. I did not
find the answer.
The lines to pay attention to are in Makefile.lib where cflags are processed.
Escaping to a shell is no option since this would be needed for all .o files
even in an otherwise noop build.
That's because all flags has to be evaluated each time to check if the flags changed.
