No, that's just the glibc change, with a vanilla kernel.
The third column is glibc change + mmap_sem patch.
The fourth column has your patch in it, too.

Well, your patch causes the performance to drop from
596 transactions/second to 545.  Your patch is the only
difference between the third and the fourth column.

I wonder if the increased parallelism simply caused
more cache line bouncing, with bounces happening in
some inner loop instead of an outer loop.
Btw, it is quite possible that the MySQL sysbench
thing gives different results on your system.  It
would be good to know what it does on a real SMP
system, vs. a single quad-core chip :)
Other architectures would be interesting to know,
too.
