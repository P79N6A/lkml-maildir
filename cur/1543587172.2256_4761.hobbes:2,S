Well, a part of the attached dmesg output yields:

0.7.[2,3] are the usb devices. BIOS (and 2.2 kernels) had them at IRQ 5. 2.4
somehow picks the irq of the ethernet adapter, iqr 11, instead.
At least usb is then unusable.
As you say that you have the same board, what is the output of dump_pirq - are
your link values in the set of {1,2,3,5} or are they continuous 1-4? Maybe you
are lucky - or better say, I am having bad luck :(
