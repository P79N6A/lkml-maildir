Do you really want to add that crud just to monitor a value? That cost 
absolutely zero (in terms of pre-allocated resources) to bump up?
Is not like, that you want to keep the bound value close to the current 
peak because using an even higher value could result in pre-allocated 
resource waste. No because I could understand if rising such number to 
higher-than-needed values could result in waste of resources, so you want 
to monitor it to keep it as close as possible to the peak. But this is not 
the case.
So today we have three groups of users:
- Users that have been hit by the limit
  * Those have probably bumped the value up to the wazzoo.
- Unaware users with machines having potential of hitting the current limit
  * Those, monitor or not, being unaware, they won't notice it until hits. 
    And since rising it costs zero, they'd likely prefer to bump it to the 
    stars instead of monitoring an incrementing by small steps.
  * Applying a lomem-dependent max_instances default value like the two 
    lines patch I posted, is probably the best choice even for stable.
- Unaware users with low-load machines
  * Those won't even notice it.
The default value can be rised, bound to lomem sizes. I see no problems in 
there. Or, like Willy said, make (for -stable) the default unlimited, and 
let sysadmins to put the bounds if they feel the DoS can apply to them.
