That sounds like a configuration error to me, and here's why.
 1. One of the available reference clocks for xntpd is the local
    RTC, type 1 in the list of reference clock types, and that
    should ALWAYS be listed as one of the reference clocks to use,
    but with a higher stratum than any other reference clock used.
 2. My experience with the xntpd driver suggests that if no better
    reference is available and the RTC is one of the listed clocks,
    then it ALWAYS adjusts the time to match the RTC, irrespective
    of the time difference between them.
 3. AFAICT, if xntpd writes to the RTC, then it has achieved true
    synchronisation to a reference clock other than the RTC.
It's for these reasons that I'm rather puzzled by the comments in this
thread so far.

If you have the RTC as one of your reference clocks, then this heuristic
is not required as xntpd (at least) does the right thing for you.

Probably the 'heuristic' of ensuring that the RTC is one of the
reference clocks is sufficient.

True.
Best wishes from Riley.
