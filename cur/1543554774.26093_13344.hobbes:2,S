It's not the with sb/without sb thing. Everything is much simpler -
changing the get_empty_inode() prototype means mandatory changes in
all 3rd-party code. Code freeze and all such...
IOW, unmodified code doesn't break from the addition of helper function,
but changing get_empty_inode() will break (albeit in a trivial way)
every bloody filesystem out there. Not a problem for 2.5, but doing that
now for no good reason...
