In my case I cannot even estimate the time. It takes 8:33 ususally to do a
bzImage, and after 15 minutes I ctrl-c with only two lines printed in the
console. If you consider the ratio between the total number of lines that
a kernel build spits out, this couls have taken hours. Also, you might
want also to try a low number of processes with a short burn, like the new
patch seems to do to better hit mm players. Something like:
irman2 -n 10 -b 40
Guys, I'm saying this not because I do not appreciate the time Con is
spending on it. I just hate to see time spent in the wrong priorities.
Whatever super privileged sleep->burn pattern you code, it can be
exploited w/out a global throttle for the CPU time assigned to interactive
and non interactive tasks. This is Unix guys and it is used in multi-user
environments, we cannot ship with a flaw like this.
