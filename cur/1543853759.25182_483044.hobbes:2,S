OK.
By using zone.total_scanned, I have chose an easy way :)
To do the general vm timing in something like zone.vm_stat[NR_SCAN_INACTIVE],
a set of new functions will be required:
        global_page_state_raw()
        zone_page_state_raw()
        node_page_state_raw()
They do not check overflows, so that we can do
        time_elapsed = new_raw_value - old_raw_value;
However, before introducing the ugly *_raw() functions, I'd like to know if
        #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
                if (x < 0)
                        x = 0;
        #endif  
really helps some big NUMA system. I suspect object counters like
NR_FILE_PAGES will _never_ overflow, and an accumulated counter like
NR_VMSCAN_WRITE is expected to overflow. In either case, it is ok to
return an unsigned long raw counter.

Wu
