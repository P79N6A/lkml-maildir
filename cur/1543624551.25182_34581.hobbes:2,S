What is "best" on Linux 2.4.X (with any appropriate patches) ?
HPT370 RAID-1 or Software RAID-1 ?
And if Software RAID-1 is best of these two, where is it most stable; on an
i815 chipset, a VIA chipset (686B) or on a promise controller?
I define "best" as:
* most stable
* least complex setup
* least hassle when something goes wrong
