..and the above is, roughly, what I understand samba etc falls back on.
The problem ends up being that the above isn't in any way safe from people 
moving files around (oops, where did those attributes go?) nor does it 
have any consistency guarantees. So it only works well if _one_ 
application does this, and that application follows all the locking rules.
Is it enough? It may have to be.

If no application does, then why back them up? Why implement them in the 
first place?
In other words - some apps obviously do want to use the. Sadly.
