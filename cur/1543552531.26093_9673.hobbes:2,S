Also you can try setsockopt with SO_RCVBUF, from man 7 socket:
       SO_RCVBUF
              Sets  or  gets the maximum socket receive buffer in
              bytes. The default value is set by the rmem_default
              sysctl  and the maximum allowed value is set by the
              rmem_max sysctl.
rmem_max defaults to 65535 perhaps you could try to increase this and
then use setsockopt in your receiving program.
