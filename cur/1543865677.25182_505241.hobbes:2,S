No, David.
I don't know why you keep repeating this mantra, when it's WRONG.
Using "select" is a lot more sane and intelligent than assuming that users 
know what dependencies they want.
The Kconfig files should ask about *end-user* visible features. They 
should say "do you want to support X".
If "X" then needs Y, Z and something else to actually compile, then that 
Kconfig file should DAMN WELL use "select". Stop claiming anything else!
The user shouldn't know that they should say that they need some library Y 
in order to even see the question for "X". It's not a sane thing to ask 
them to know and care about. They care about the devices or capabilities 
they want to support, not about the fact that a USB storage device needs 
the SCSI core layer, for example.
So stop saying "don't use select".
