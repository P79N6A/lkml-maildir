There are certainly many others way to get gathering, without adding an
artificial delay.  There are already delay slots built into the code 
which could
be used to trigger the gathering, so with a little bit different 
architecture, the
performance increases could be achieved.
Some implementations actually do write gathering with NFSv3, even.  Is
this interesting enough to play with?  I suspect that just doing the 
work for
NFSv2 is not...
    Thanx...
