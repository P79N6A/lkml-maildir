I was envisaging a larger buffer where the current location pointer 
simply taken by the interrupt handler, and the remaining section of
that buffer was used for the "inner printk". Which is really just 
like a stack, so it makes more sense to just allocate this off the
stack really .... I think this would work? We might need to flush
on a certain size limit (128 chars, maybe?) to stop any risk of
stack overflow.

It seems that 99.9% of these cases are just assembling a line of output 
a few characters at a time. There might be a few odd miscreants around,
but not enough to worry about - I think it's overkill to do the runtime
timer check, but we could always run like this to test it, or try to
work some sort of automated code inspection (though that sounds hard to
do 100% reliably).
