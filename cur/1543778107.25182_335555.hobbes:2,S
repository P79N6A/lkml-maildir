http://www.intel.com/products/processor/xeon/index.htm
Shows that the lowest speed Xeon with EM64T is 2.83GHz.
http://commerce.euro.dell.com/dellstore/config/frameset.asp?c=607&n=3410&b=62417&m=gbp&cs=ukbsdt1&sbc=ukbsdpedge&v=d&cu=etstore&l=en&s=ukbsd&store=ukbsd
Shows a system taking 1-4 of those processors at 2.0, 2.2, 2.7 and
3.0GHz, making them 32bit only.
Memory you can configure is from 1GiB (4x256MiB) to 32GiB (16x2GiB).
If I'd buy a server I wouldn't buy one of those however, I'm just
answering the question.
Disclaimer: I do not have anything to do with either of the above
mentioned vendors. I just looked up the first vendor that came into
my head.
