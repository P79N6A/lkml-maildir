You actually show the solution to your problem.
echo * | wc
worked, right?  So pass your list of files to your apps the same way,
namely as a list to stdin.  (And if that's not an option, you can always
add a -f <filename> flag to your custom commands where the file holds
the list of files you're working with.)  Since we're dealing with
"custom commands" you should be able to customize them accordingly.
