this shows that agressive idle-rebalancing is the most important factor. I
think this means that the unification of the balancing code should go into
the other direction: ie. applying the ->nr_balanced logic to the SMP
balancer as well.
kernelbench is the kind of benchmark that is most sensitive to over-eager
global balancing, and since the 2.5.59 ->nr_balanced logic produced the
best results, it clearly shows it's not over-eager. hackbench is one that
is quite sensitive to under-balancing. Ie. trying to maximize both will
lead us to a good balance.
