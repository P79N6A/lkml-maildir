Yesterday I needed for some obscure reason access
from Linux to a bfs filesystem (/stand) on a SCO
Unixware 7 system.
Looking whether there was a bfs implementation already
I only found questions or negations, like
From Scott G. Hall (1999/05/07):
> The kernels (in /stand) are in a bfs type filesystem. 
> Most BSD & Linux boxes won't know how to mount it
> because they don't have a driver for it.
From Jingke Li (1999/09/02):
> I'd like to know ways for Linux to access SCO Unixware's
> vxfs, ufs, sfs, bfs, and/or s5 file systems.
So, I wrote something and it works for me.
Find it in 
ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/aeb/bfsmod.c
or in 
ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/aeb/
Note that this was written without specs of the fs
and with only one specimen of such a fs at hand.
If anybody has more information about the structure
of the superblock or inodes, I'd like to hear.
By the way, this is read-only only.
Making it read-write would be an easy exercise.

P.S. This is not the BeFS of BeOS.
