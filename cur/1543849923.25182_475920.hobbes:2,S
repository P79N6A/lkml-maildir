Yes, I got your idea in your first message, and well, that was
discussed (however, not being a fbdev), and the people thought that
putting them together will, maybe, cause confusion; so having them out
from drivers/video should be better. Your idea, which merge them into
a "drivers/display" could be a good one, but I don't think people will
like to change such critical tree right now. Also, I'm not the one who
maintain such tree, so my opinion won't make changes about that ;)

No. You are supposed to _use_ the ks0108's exported functions: I split
the code into the ks0108 and the cfag12864b because I thought it was
the logical way, as the cfag12864b LCD just send the data through two
different ks0108 controllers. The same way, you can use the ks0108's
exported functions to create another whateverlcd.c which has one or
more ks0108 controllers.

Why it shouldn't? It doesn't work for you? AFAIK, it is a usual fbdev,
and you can map any fbdev as they are simple character file devices.
