Why would the kernel NOT use available source of entropy? If the kernel is
gathering entropy, in what way is user mode better? Are you going to make
users install disk, keystroke, packet, etc daemons to do the work of the
kernel?
The only reason I can see for not doing this is if there is reason to
believe that it is not producing useful information.
