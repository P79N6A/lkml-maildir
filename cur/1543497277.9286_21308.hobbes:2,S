I see this problem on 2.2.5-ac6 and 2.2.9:
After a while (minutes to hours) of working fine, the console keyboard will
start acting as though shift is held down. Caps Lock will revert letters
to lowercase, but not numbers or symbols (so I can't type [,./;'-=\]).
It affects both text consoles and the X display. Sometimes the problem
will spontaneously fix itself, and the problem is always absent on boot.
Alt-SysRq-R says it's putting the keyboard into RAW mode, but does not
change the symptoms.
I have replaced the keyboard and the motherboard (FIC-2013), yet the
problem recurs.
I used the system for several months without this problem, and can't peg
its appearance to any particular change. Not do I know any way to trigger
it on purpose.
Other system hardware includes a Diamond V330, FirePort 40 SCSI,
Seagate SCSI tape drive, and Maxtor IDE drive. The processor is a K6-2.
I'll watch the list for replies.
