It doesn't, but EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL makes it quite clear what you can not do if
you are not a GPL module.

Then choose not to use it and move on, rather than lamenting the fact that

Its disturbing to you, and you alone.  If you stopped using Linux today because
of this, no one would miss you.  If enough like-minded people did this, you
would all be using your business model, and th F/OSS community would continue on
its way.  You appear to think that the community relies on people who make
drivers in you're model, and thats simply not the case.
