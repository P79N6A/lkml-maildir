Thanks for the reply.
I have tried with getrusage it is giving zero as the result. 
I have found one more method(using setitimer(ITIMER_PROF,&enc_timer,NULL);
and signal SIGPROF) which will give the user and system time of a process. 
Is it applicable for the thread?
Does this method give the expected results for thread?

man getrusage.
Pay special attention to the RUSAGE_SELF or RUSAGE_CHILDREN
flag, but I think current linux kernel does not perform a correct account
for threads rusage in the parent. Probably you will have to account each
thread, return info to the parent and sum or average (sum cpu times,
average elapsed times...)
