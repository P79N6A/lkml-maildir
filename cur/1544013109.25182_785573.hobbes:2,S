Yes, doing an audit of actual and potential local_t-like users is on my
todo list (after the merge frenzy).  I like your variable types, but it
make a trival implementation difficult/impossible, which is optimal for
sparc64 and similar to what SNMP counters currently use.  We might not
be able to please everyone though.

Yes, and this is a hack.  Eventually we want to grow the percpu area, but
that may not be done for 2.6.30.  Most allocations are tiny, so we'd need
thousands to overflow.  Those are the kind of people who do vmalloc= on
the command line, so percpu= shouldn't kill them.

Yes, and hence I double-checked it with allyesconfig.  We'll need to be
vigilant as we add more usages.

I don't think it's a problem.  You still can't use them directly (this
wording was not meant to imply that), but you can now hand their addresses
to per_cpu_ptr() etc.  So zero-based x86-64 should Just Work.
