Your analysis is correct. It is not necessary or useful to use dirtied = 1 
at the end of st_read(). It has been a long time since I introduced 
release_buffering() into st.c and I did not read all of the code now.

Please don't. I have a very conservative attitude to these things: my 
priority is to make sure that the data is correct even if it is not the 
fastest code. I will happily let others point out when I am too 
conservative.
