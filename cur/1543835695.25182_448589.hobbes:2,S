Uh?  Where did you face a problem there?
With maildir, you shouldn't face any problems IMO. Even users with
zillions of mails should work properly with the dir_index stuff:
	tune2fs -O dir_index /dev/hdXX
or alternatively (to start that for already existing directories):
	e2fsck -fD /dev/hdXX
Of course, you'll always face a problem with lots of files in one
directory at getdents() time (eg. opendir()/readdir()/closedir()), but
this is a common limit for all filesystems.
