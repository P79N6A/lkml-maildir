hi,
i've just tried to "search for something in the RAM", so i thougt 
/proc/kcore would be a good address to start. i really only wanted to 
grep for raw data throught it, i did not need any specific meta-data.
ok, i checked:
$ ls -lah /proc/kcore
-r--------  1 root root 256M Mar  4 23:25 /proc/kcore
which makes sense, since i have 256MB RAM.
$ su -
Password:
root$ cp /proc/kcore /data/Incoming/
`/proc/kcore' -> `/data/Incoming/kcore'
root$ ls -la /proc/kcore /data/Incoming/kcore
-r--------  1 root root 1.0G Mar  4 23:26 /data/Incoming/kcore
-r--------  1 root root 1.0G Mar  4 23:27 /proc/kcore
whooha! /proc/kcore and its new on-disk copy are now both 1GB in size.
how comes? i could imagine, that when "cp" tried to copy /proc/kcore the 
RAM gets filled with /proc/kcore again, thus doubling it...somehow...but 
cp continued with no errors, why should it double /proc/kcore 
(256MB->512MB) and then again (512MB->1024MB), but stop after this? i 
would've expected cp to never stop copying...
i don't get it,
Christian.
