Ok, I thought you were asking about the code that called filemap_fdatawrite, 
which does wait.  filemap_flush is used on the underlying block device.  In 
the case of a page that is already under IO, the io is not cancelled but 
allowed to continue.
This is the desired result.  When you're doing a number of operations in 
sequence, each operation will start io on the block device.  If they used 
filemap_fdatawrite instead of filemap_flush, they would end up being 
synchronous.
