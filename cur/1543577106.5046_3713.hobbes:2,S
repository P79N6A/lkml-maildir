There's a problem. depmod should not try to do anything besides giving
its version when --version is used, should it? I'd rather expect exit(0)
or _exit(0); for --version and --help.
(modprobe shows the same behaviour as depmod, insmod throws its version
number and the usage information, I did not bother to check the other
tools.)
$ /sbin/depmod --version
depmod version 2.3.24
