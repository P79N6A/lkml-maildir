* ide-scsi has problems with multiple LUNs detection (HP 8100 cdrw).
  There's also a report that it may hang with it turned off too but I
  can't reproduce it here.
* ide-scsi has problems with scsi command translation. After certain
  scsi-general operations the scsi subsystem is confused and IIRC it
  even lead to a crash once. I can reproduce this too with HP 8100 cdrw.
  The workaround is to eject and reinsert the cd after using sg.
