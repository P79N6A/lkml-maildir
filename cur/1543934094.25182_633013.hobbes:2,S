One some platforms, due to bootloader restrictions or whatever,
there are hard limits on how large the main kernel image can be.
On sparc64 for example the limit is around 6.5MB
But this "big question" isn't the important issue, in fact it's
tangental and has no bearing on the final decision we make
here.
Rather, choice is, and taking choice away is bad.  I may have a reason
to make AF_UNIX modular, I might not, but either way taking that
option away from me is not the right thing to do.
