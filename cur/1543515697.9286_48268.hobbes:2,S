I would like to concur with this.  Part of the problem with Disk
Manager et al is that they modify /dev/hda, which means that if the
Disk Manager signature is detected, there is no way to access the
whole disk as "random bulk storage"... including to wipe out Disk Manager.
I would like to at least be able to:
	really-use-whole-disk /dev/hda
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=1024 count=1
	fdisk /dev/hda
	  # Create partitions
	sync
	reboot
... all automatically.
