Yes, you need to apply each patch, using:
bzip2 -dc patch-2.5.53.bz2 | patch -p1
and you can test them first using:
bzip2 -dc patch-2.5.53.bz2 | patch -p1 --dry-run

Note - if 2.5.58 doesn't work, you can always download patch-2.5.58,
and apply it with:
bzip2 -dc patch-2.5.58.bz2 | patch -p1 -R
to create a 2.5.57 tree, even if you didn't go from 2.5.57 to 2.5.58
by using a patch.
John.
