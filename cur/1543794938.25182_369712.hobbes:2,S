I don't think this is the right place to drain the pcp.  Since direct
reclaim is already done, so it is possible that allocator can service
the request without draining the pcps.

Why this order limit.  Most of the previous failures seen (because of my
earlier patches of bigger and more physical contiguous chunks for pcps) 
were with order 1 allocation.

That code has issues with pre-emptible kernel.
I will be shortly sending the patch to free pages from pcp when higher
order
allocation is not able to get serviced from global list.
