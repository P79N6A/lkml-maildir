Yes.  I just happened to notice bitrev.c at the end of my git pull and wondered
if it was what it sounded like...

It doesn't actually make any difference, but I think such functions should be
so marked anyway: it gives both the code writer and the compiler more
information (though they're both free to ignore it if they like).

I'm not sure that's a good idea.  You have to be careful not to cause confusion
with ordinary "const".

Indeed, though I presume you don't mean in this particular case...
