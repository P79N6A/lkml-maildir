Unilateral backoff isn't guaranteed to work as well as multilateral
backoff which can't be done in software AFAIK.

The hardware specs don't guarantee fairness.  The only architecture I
know of that did guarantee fairness was IBM's 370 architecture and that
guarantee only appeared in registered confidential copies of the
architecture as an engineering note.
What you can do is write your own FIFO spin lock based on the bakery
algorithm.  It will require two words instead of one, one for the
"next ticket" and one for the "current ticket".   To get the next
ticket value use LOCK XADD which should be guaranteed to work.  Then just
spin until the current value equals your ticket value.   You also
have the advantage that when a contended lock is released all the
waiting processors all don't try to grab the lockword cache line
exclusive all at once.  That stuff was spaced out earlier.   If you
have lots of storage you can put the two words in separate cache lines.
Also it's quite easy to make a FIFO read write upgradable spin lock
out of it without increasing the path length of the write lock part.
Bakery algorithms are fun.
