It's not for native file system, but one that are coming around. I kind
of misspoke when I said that the VFS layer is going to be pushed into
userspace. It's not. Access to the VFS layer is going to be exported to
userspace. The system is interesting because of its potential programming
flexibility.

Don't know. But if you can get away from the typical C programming errors, then
it could be a win.

Message passing is used as a method of concurrency in that system outside
of the typical use of function calles. It makes access to kernel facilities,
remote or local, transparent. They also don't use a mutex for their locking,
but something called a token which is per-CPU kind of locking primitive. It's
definitely an interesting system with a lot of potential.
