I showed the case when it does not work at all. And then found (in this
mail), that task (part) has to be present in the memory, which means it
will be locked, which in turns will not work with the system which
already locked its range allowed by the limits.
And returning to the oom_adj and cpusets tunables. Why any new process
started in given cpuset can not be tuned by external application or some
script to have bigger/smaller oom_adj parameter? :)

Just the way it works right now :)
You do not object against patches which improve superh cpu support
with the argument, that it is not possible to enable that feature,
when system does not have superh cpu.

Let me draw the line in this discussion: people propose a patches to tweak
the oom-killer behaviour in some situation. You say that this does not
cover another case, and thus has to be dropped. You instead propose
another solution, which does not work either in some cases (IMO more
wider).
It may be a good idea, and likely it is (at least its notification
part), but please look a bit wider, since in cases when it does not work,
still there are lots of systems which want to have a proper OOM tunables.

You also used oom_adj which was not documented. Is this an argument?

Hmm, you likely missed the part in the last line. And in the first two,
where I said that before oom-killer started (and killed some processes,
usually not those which were need, but its a different story). System
just did not have a free memory to have _any_ progress neither in atomic
context, nor in process, so it had to invoke an oom-killer.
In that case userspace just can not reply or even awake. While kernel is
effectively alive if it does not need to allocate a memory. And could
kill some process to free up the ram.
Userspace notifications are great, no problem, but do not rely on them,
since there is a huge world outside the case it works in, which will be
quite unhappy when systems start freezing because oom-killer relied on
the userspace.
