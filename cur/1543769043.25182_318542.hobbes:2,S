Most of the benefit of this can be recovered by organizing the user
address space for compactness without incurring the context switch
overhead of TLB reloads or TLB footprint of a separate kernel address
space (or other issues of a third-party patch). Linking with low
starting text addresses, stack below text, and manual placement of
mmap()'s all help to conserve user virtualspace. It's also useful
in tandem with such in order to extract the maximum benefit from
the additional virtualspace (as the costs above warrant recovery).
