define "supported"; we have code to try it and it's great if it works.
But if it doesn't... you're out of luck.
We KNOW it can't work on a sizable amount of machines.  This is why it
is a config option; you can enable it if YOUR machine is KNOWN to work,
and you get some gains. But it's also understood that it often it won't
work. So any sensible distro (since they have to aim for a wide
audience) disables this option ...

"it works on my one machine so it works for everyone". That's simply not
true. We KNOW it can't work everywhere on UP, especially on i386. SMM
assumptions; people gluing the apic pins to the reset line, we've seen
it all. 
That it works for you is great. But that doesn't mean it automatically
works for everyone.
