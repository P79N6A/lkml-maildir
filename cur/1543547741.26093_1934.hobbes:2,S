Mindspring did this (maybe still does.)  I think they successfully pissed
off every one of their (then) customers doing this shit.  They lost an
unreported number of users as a result.
As an aside, they also have/had agressive transparent web proxying in
the network... everything on port 80 coming and going is/was cached.
EVERYTHING.

One could say this about SPAM in general.  SMTP was designed as on open
transport.  Now we have to go around and board up the windows so no one
can see inside.

They aren't rewriting your packects; they just simply force you to connect
to _their_ mail servers for incoming and outgoing mail.

ARIN (and other registries) don't like "static IP" ISPs.  Besides, the
provider wants to be able to charge a s***load for a static address even
when their DHCP hardware already is configured to prefer reassigning the
same address -- people have been known to have the same address for months
even after prolonged down time.
