No, the pgrp is required at mount time and must be the pid of the
process group leader. But it isn't enforced in the code so that "is" a
bug.

What your missing is that all I'm asking for is a little background
information on what the change is about so that I can understand it.
I think you are making assumptions that just aren't true about my
understanding of the pid namespace work.
The current situation is that pgrp corresponds to the session leader of
the automount(8) process and that process is started at boot so I guess
it is within the global namespace. All we need to do now (since the
issue will be much more complex if we consider multiple instances of
automount(8) started within pid namespaces) is verify that changes we
make to obtain the pgrp will correspond to the pid of automount(8) in
the global namespace.
I suspect the main issue that is looming for autofs wrt. pid namespaces
is that file system namespaces are not tied to pid namespaces. That will
probably lead to the situation were don't know whether we want the pgrp
of an automount(8) within the pid namespace or we actually need it for
the process in the global namespace, assuming the file system namespace
might be shared between multiple pid namespaces.
But, I'm not up with this at all so I could be very mistaken.
Hopefully this little rant will clarify what I'm asking, but then maybe
I've just got it all wrong and made the situation worse, so help me out!
