I'm not convinced it's *totally* off-topic.  I'll agree that third-party
binaries are on their own as far as active support goes, but I don't see
that it's off-topic to post a simple statement-of-fact like "2.6.mumble-rc1
breaks <popular-driver-FOO>" just so it's a *known* issue and people who
search the list archives don't spend forever re-inventing the wheel.  Also,
it's quite *possible* that the binary module has tripped over a geniune
regression or bug in the kernel.
