You don't. I discussed this last week with Russell King: the ARM port
also doesn't have the file hw_irq.h in include/asm-arm. According to
Russell it is only needed in the arch dependent subdirectories, and not
in the drivers.
Any driver that includes linux/irq.h is not written to be portable. The
only generic driver that includes it is driver/pcmcia/hd64465_ss.c, but
on second glance it's a Hitachi HD64465 specific driver anyway.
