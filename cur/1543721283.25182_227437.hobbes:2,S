I ran ext3 with data=journal on 2.6.6smp for about a week on a heavily
loaded system (I mean it).  I did not ever experience filesystem
corruption (related to the fs code).  I did, however, hit complete
system lockup once.  It *may* have been unrelated to the fs code.
(If you use quota, it *will* lock.  The author is working on a fix.
Above, I am referring to a lockup with quota off).
