We've got server crash after some day uptime, without any log : the
screen is black, server doesn't respond to icmp ping packets so we can't
figure about the problem ... press-reset-button is not the best solution
to live with this problem.
Configuration :
2.2.13 smp kernel with solar designer's secure linux patch
ABIT BP6 motherboard
2xCeleron-366 running at 5.5x95Mhz (yes, it's overlocked but it seemed rock stable)
Udma33 IDE disk (IBM-DJNA-371350, 12949MB w/1966kB Cache, CHS=26310/16/63, UDMA)
[it can do udma 66 too but it isn't used here at the moment]
96M ram
scsi controller : Chip NCR53C810, device id 0x1, revision id 0x2
some old scsi harddisk
strip mode software raid on two of scsi disks
average load on the server
Has anyone similar problem or solution ?
Thanx : gabor.
