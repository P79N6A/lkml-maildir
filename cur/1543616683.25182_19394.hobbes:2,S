If you're using an RPM-based distribution, you can use rpm to find this
kind of information.
$ rpm -qf /bin/mount
mount-2.10f-1
Now, get the mount-2.10f-1.src.rpm from your install media, use rpm -ivh to
install it, then rpm -bp on the installed specfile to recover the actual
source tree used to build that version of mount.
