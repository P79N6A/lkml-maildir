Daniel, you are still in denial. OF COURSE it changes something: it adds 
a line of code to a driver, where that line was not needed before. 
That's against the fundamental task of a driver model: TO KEEP THINGS 
SIMPLE. Yes, this concept includes single-line changes as well.
yes, a single line might not sound much, but it's exactly one line more 
than necessary.
