NFS don't see mountpoints. It's a strange feature but it is really done that
way. I can mount my /dev/hdc on a non-empty dir in NFS exported tree and
I see hdc filesystem when browsing it locally, but NFS clients
still see old dir contents - they don't see mounted drive there!
I don't know whether it's bug or a feature.
Every automounted dir under automount mountpoint is a mountpoint too,
that's why you can't export them via NFS.
