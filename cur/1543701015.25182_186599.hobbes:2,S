The primary benchmark for -tiny is how much space it frees up, which
is very straightforward. More generally, I think we've got something
of a crisis on our hands in terms of benchmarking as caching
architectures are making microbenchmark results worse than worthless
for real life and changes like these are often lost in the noise for
larger benchmarks.

For the purposes of my -tiny tree, I'd like to make every new feature
conditional as an aid to footprint measurement, benchmarking, regression
testing, etc. When I start feeding these patches to mainline, they can
be made unconditional as is warranted.
