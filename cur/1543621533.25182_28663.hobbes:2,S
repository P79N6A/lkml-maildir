It was a quick fix because I thought someone else was going to fix it...
How about the following patch?
kernel builds and boots with patch (with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD disabled).
I think this is unrelated but I suddenly got the following messages while trying to build another kernel:
Feb 18 00:02:51 frodo kernel: hdc: lost interrupt
Feb 18 00:03:31 frodo last message repeated 4 times
Feb 18 00:04:31 frodo last message repeated 6 times
Feb 18 00:05:31 frodo last message repeated 6 times
Feb 18 00:06:31 frodo last message repeated 6 times
now my some files (including gcc) are screwed and I cannot test this patch with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD enabled...
