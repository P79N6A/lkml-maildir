Okay.  More progress here.  The calculation of the "wscale" values
is based on the "tcp_rmem" sysctl numbers.
The defaults for these *differ* between 2.6.16.18 and 2.6.17-rc*.
2.6.16: 4096    87380    174760  
2.6.17: 4096    87380   2097152
If I change the tcp_rmem setting on 2.6.17 to match the old value,
then the website www.everymac.com becomes accessible again:
echo 4096 87380 174760 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
Looking at diffs between 2.6.16 and 2.6.17, I see a big rework
of the tcp_rmem code in linux/net/ipv4/tcp.c
Looks like something got broken there, or possibly the wscale
calculations have a bug that is only triggered by the new rmem values ??
