which leads me to the question:
Is there any reason for the (IMHO stupid) "dynamic" naming of
SCSI devices (in contrast to e.g. IDE devices or the "physical"
device naming used in Solaris)?
It may be possible always maintaining the "right" order with
one SCSI chain, but as soon as there is a second bus, it is
really a pain. Is devfs the only solution?
Regards,
Wolfgang
