Sometimes the "old" code is set up in such a way that the "right" way
to do it is not possible. That doesn't make the last guy "stupid": it
can be that when he did it, that was the right way to do things, but
that we've learned since then.
If the "cleanup" would result in changing more than say 60% of the
code, then a rewrite is in order. The old code is usually still in
place. That will allow you to "steal" code that is not the core of the
rewrite: just copy it.
I've heard that someone is trying to revolutionize "source code
control systems". He's rewriting almost everything, and not enhancing
any previous systems. What was his name again?
