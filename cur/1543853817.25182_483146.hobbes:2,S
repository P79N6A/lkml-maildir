If you can find a way to invoke init_cpufreq_transition_notifier_list 
earlier than core_initcall time, that would be okay.  I did it this way 
because it was easiest, but earlier should be just as good.
The only requirement is that alloc_percpu() has to be working, so that the 
SRCU per-cpu data values can be set up.  I don't know how early in the 
boot process you can do per-cpu memory allocation.
As an alternative approach, initialization of srcu_notifiers could be 
broken up into two pieces, one of which could be done statically.  The 
part that has to be done dynamically (the SRCU initialization) wouldn't 
mess up the notifier chain.  Provided the dynamic part is carried out 
while the system is still single-threaded, it would be safe.
