Can you explain what you mean by "network connections go bogus". Whether
or not you have more that 4GB or RAM and therefore have to page it
into lower virtual addresses has nothing at all to do with networking
unless you have a network device driver that did not allocate memory
properly. If so, that should be checked out.
Since there is only 32 bits of address space in the Intel machines,
the virtual memory seen by a process can't exceed that, including
the kernel itself. However, the physical memory can come from anywhere
and that's what the extended-memory specification attempts to provide.
If something is hurting the network, it shouldn't be so.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
