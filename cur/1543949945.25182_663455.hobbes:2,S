How's this:
PATCH Mempolicy:  update documentation and comments
Address stale comments and numa_memory_policy.txt discussion
based on Mel Gorman's changes to page allocation zonelist handling.
Specifically:  mpol_free() and mpol_copy() no longer need to deal
with a custom zonelist for MPOL_BIND policy, and MPOL_BIND now
allocates memory from the nearest node with available memory in the
specified nodemask.
In "fixing" the mpol_free() and mpol_copy() comments in mempolicy.h,
I wanted to replace them with something, rather than just deleting
them.  So, I described the reference counting.  Not directly related
to the zonelist changes, but useful, IMO.
