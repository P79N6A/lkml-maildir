Suppose I name an executable this:
"\n<0>Oops: EIP=0"
That comes out as a KERN_EMERG log message,
hitting the console and maybe a pager even.
There seem to be a number of places in the
kernel that printk current->comm without
concern for what it may contain.
Escape codes and non-ASCII can make for some
interesting log messages as well. Terminals
may have some programmable keys or answerback
messages. So one day root is using grep on
the log files, and they program the answerback
string to contain a "\r\nrm -r /\r\n"...
BTW, the 0x9b character is often an escape.
