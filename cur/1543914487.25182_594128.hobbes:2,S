But it isn't completely in-kernel.  It is policy, and policy belongs in 
userspace.
The kernel provides the mechanism for autosuspending idle devices and 
setting the idle-delay length.  But userspace must be responsible for 
deciding what devices to autosuspend and how long the idle delays 
should be.
