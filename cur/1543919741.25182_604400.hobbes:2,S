I would assume that that is true for all PHY's - if there is no link to keep the
carrier active on I would think that the power consumption is nominal across the
board. Once the PHY detects link pulses it should obviously use different power
levels to negotiate the link for each speed.
PHY autonegotiation just works the same across the board - the PHY's send out
little pulses (iow nominal power consumption) to detect a link partner, and only
when one is found do they engage in more aggressive conversation to establish
capabilities across the link.
