Like Matthew stated, either use the udev rc startup script, or put udev
into your initramfs image to catch all of the early boot messages.
Doing the initramfs method is still very tough to do right now, but
people have reported success that way.  I still recommend just using the
init.d script for now.
Oh, and if you do have any udev problems, please post them to the
linux-hotplug-devel mailing list.
thanks,
