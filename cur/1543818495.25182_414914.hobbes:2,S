Why do we need the 'up_mutex' mutex? Was this a bug in the old code?

I suppose this is an alright change. As long as it is understood that
there is no guarantee about the layout of the inotify_watch structure. A
comment in inotify.h should do.

Well, I think it's up for the kernel consumers to decide whether or not
this is acceptable. It's probably a good idea to come up with some use
cases for the kernel API and see if this _is_ a problem. Since the
callbacks will be run inside the VFS ops, they need to be small and
fast, so they probably should just be putting the event on a list and
handling it later.
Looking over the patch, nothing jumps out at me as being wrong. But some
stress testing would convince me faster than my eyes can.
