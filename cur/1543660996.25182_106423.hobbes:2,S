Seems to me the best place to do the graphical thing is at the distro.
Mandrake has been messing with GUI bootscreens for a few versions, now, and
while I haven't been excited by the results I think it's the right place. My
only reason for not liking Mandrake's screens is that I *like* plain text.
The distros will want to tailor the screens themselves, anyway, so let em
do the code, too.
