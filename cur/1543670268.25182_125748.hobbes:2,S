> Since then, i only got these "reset storms" versions over versions.
Jim Radford's nodemgr back-off patch fixes the reset storms, for me at
least. (check the list archives, he posted it a few weeks ago).
It should definitely be applied, but I would hold off until we fix the
nodemgr crash bug, since Jim's patch masks (but does not eliminate) it.
I'd rather force people to deal with the nodemgr crash :)
(if nobody picks up the torch on nodemgr, I'll try myself in a few
days - I'm too busy now but boy I want it FIXED! :)
Regards,
Dan
