Well the MDIO device actually is conceptually separate from the ethernet 
controller that shares register space with it.  For example, we may have a 
processor with 4 ethernet controllers on it.  We use the register set in 
controller 1 to get to the MDIO "device" for all four controllers.
Hopefully, Andy can provide further details about order issues and how the 
current PHY layer interacts with the ethernet controller.
However, the issue still exists that the MDIO devices registers live 
inside another devices register space.
