Are you being deliberately obtuse? Your "that would explain a lot"
comment is an obvious insult.
Al, I'm really tired of your snide comments. You've been hostile and
making personal attacks for years now. You've been rude and insulting
to other people on this list as well. Even if you don't care how
childish it appears, just save us all the bandwidth. We don't want to
play that game with you.
And I don't care to discuss this further. I know what your two
possible reactions are:
- you're not being rude (uh, yeah, right)
- it doesn't matter as long as your technical points are correct (I'm
  just quoting you there) (BTW: you're not infallible either).
