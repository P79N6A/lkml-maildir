I'll disagree cheerfully with this.   I've a bit of experience
in the area and find that the bulk of serious multithreaded applications
use and desire pthreads.

This might be true in linux, but is not true at all in the general
industry.   Pthreads are quite extensively used in large SMP applications.
Another example of a pthreaded application, available for linux, is 
the mysql database software.

I'll also disagree with this.   Thread private storage is quite important.
In any case, pthreads support is required by the Single Unix Specification, 
and divergence from that does neither linux nor the unix community in general 
any good whatsoever.  Let's not try to out-microsoft microsoft.

Of course they can, however, they have all the pitfalls and deficiencies
of the kernel mechanism, one of which is the requirement that thread 
stacks be fixed size which is not compatible with pthreads either as
defined by POSIX or as adopted by the Open Group.

Only if you are willing to live within the limitations of the trick, 
which may prevent portable software from being usable on linux.

You would rewrite it each context switch.  1 cache line or less of data.

This is of course a platform issue, and each platform may do it a 
different way.   On PA-RISC and ARM one can issue the system call, 
if it cannot be implemented more efficiently.

Again, the is platform dependent code  and doing it for x86 doesn't imply
it has to be done the same way on other archs.   Mips  does have features
that make a PDA easily implemented, for example.  
My proposal is aimed at ia32 platforms only at this time.

No, it cannot be globally mapped.  It must be only accessible to a single
processor.   This implies only that one page directory entry will differ
between two clones sharing an address space.   It will cause a TLB flush
in some (perhaps boundary) cases of two threads in the same address 
space are being switched between.  I don't consider this typical (see 
earlier post to Ingo Molnar). 
In fact, if it could be arranged that the TLB entry is never flushed, 
it would be good - since it will _always_ map the same physical page
for each processor forever.   I think this can be done just by setting
the global bit in the pte, it will remain cached on each processor
(assuming it isn't flushed by another 4MB page) even though each
processor will have as different physical address in the tlb.

Variable sized and autogrowth kernel stacks aren't bad.  I'd argue that larger
stacks aren't necessarily bad, either.   Depends on the system, workload, 
drivers, etc. 
The ability to, for example, allocate scatter-gather lists on the kernel
stack rather than call a memory allocator in the I/O path would be a
win.  Likewise for the struct kiobuf.

Keep a reserved page per processor for this very eventuality.  Take the
page back before dismissing the interrupt.   Panic if the subsequent
guard page is hit (assuming a recursive loop error).

True for getpid, that was a bad example on my part. 
It is not necessarily true for gettimeofday(), times(),
kernel random number seed  and other data frequently required
from the kernel;  The kernel could even use it to export 
code to user-mode, e.g. for signal handling.
