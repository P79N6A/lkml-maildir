In related news, the kernel zlib still claims to be 1.1.3.  The
security bug fixed with 1.1.4 was a double-free problem which doesn't
apply to the kernel version anymore, but other functional changes were
missed as well.  Does anyone really understand what those changes are
about? David perhaps?
If not, I will prepare a patch.
