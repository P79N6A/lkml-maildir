A subsequently started task, that wants to use the same port, gets from bind above error message.This is, in my opinion, wrong behavior, because of the connectionless nature of UDP. Only reboot solves this situation. It looks, as if in net/socket.c, TCP and UDP are handled in the same way without taking into account the different nature of the protocols?!
