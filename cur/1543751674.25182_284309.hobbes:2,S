Replace __LOG_BUF_LEN with log_buf_len.  __LOG_BUF_LEN is the default
size, log_buf_len is the actual size used, including boot time
overrides with log_buf_len=.

The debug caller needs to know where the ring pointers are as well.
Also __log_buf is not necessarily the current log buffer, boot with
log_buf_len= and you get a different buffer.  The caller needs the

That assumes that you have enough free space to copy the log buffer to.
In the general debugging case that is not true, especially if you want
the entire print buffer to be printed.  The only safe way to access the
complete print buffer is in situ.  Which is what the patch above does.
