Anything fork/exec-y should show it's slower. Most stuff either forks
and execs (in case it's silly to do it twice, and much cheaper to do
it at exec time), or it's a clone, in which case a different set of
rules applies for what you want (and actually, I suspect fork w/o exec
is much the same).
Of course the pig is you can't determine at fork whether it'll exec 
or not, so you optimise for the common case, which is "do exec", unless
given a hint otherwise.
For clone, and I suspect fork w/o exec, you have a tightly coupled 
group of processes that really would like to be close to each other.
If you have 1 app on the whole system, you *may* want it spread across
the system. If you have nr_apps >= nr_nodes, you probably want them
node local. Determining which workload you have is messy, and may
change.
Tweak the freak benchmark, not everything else ;-)
