Marcel,
This is the Linux kernel development ML, if you have a problem, you should
really try hard to see what could be wrong.
1. oops is of good help.
2. go into a tty (ctrl+alt+f1) and try moving between runlevels and see if you
notice anything. Additionally see if this only occurs when only shuting down,
or rebooting or if also when moving from runlevels.
3. Could this also be a distro problem associated with the intel_agp module in X?
Ask yourself questions, do some googling and once you have some outputs then
maybe people can have something for you here.
.Alejandro
