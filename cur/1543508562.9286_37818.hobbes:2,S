I too think Gaurav's has the right approach for most uses. It seems pretty straightforward
to add a "queue create" call, and an extra queue identifier parameter to the other calls.
Probably a "queue delete" would be needed to round things out. With that addition I think
the design should suit nearly everyone. The multi-queue addition seems worthwhile. Only a
small percentage of programs need this, but it should not cause a significant hit to the
others, so its a Good Thing.
I don't see why you would want to emulate the select call through the new API. You can't
really get rid of the existing select call - it would break too many programs. If both the
select and event queue mechanisms are handled in the kernel it doesn't seem like an event
queue push would be necessary.
The scalability web site refers to a "hinting" feature that is in progress, but the
description is not very detailed. Is this, in fact, an implementation of Gaurav's design?
