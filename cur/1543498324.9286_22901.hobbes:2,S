Notice that "diskless" was in quotes.  It's actually a dataless machine -
the only information on the disk is the cachefs and swap.  That way you
don't take the speed hit associated with running your filesystems over
NFS (since all the commonly used OS stuff will land in disk cache and
stay there even across reboots), but you get the managability of a
diskless box (i.e. there is nothing on the disk that has to be backed
up... you can even boot without the disk if it fails)
This sort of thing is great when you have hundreds of workstations to
centrally administer.
