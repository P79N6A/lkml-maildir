Normally a serial console is best, and if you have at least 2 machines
you can cross-connect the serial ports with a NULL-modem cable and run
a terminal emulator (e.g. minicom) to log it to disk on the other system.
Having netdump is also a good choice, though maybe not quite as reliable
as a real serial console.

At this point (and above) the process is in an IRQ handler, so it is likely
that the problem exists somewhere at that level.  However, the critical
part of the oops is missing - what actually went wrong?  It could be a BUG,
which is a kernel assertion, or it could be a bad pointer dereference, or
anything really.  There is nothing here which indicates what the problem is.
