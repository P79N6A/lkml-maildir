Subject: 2.4.18 memory leak, or just mis-understanding?

A 2.4.18 system in my domain swaps heavily with no apparent reason.  
Summing up memory usage according to /proc/meminfo, /proc/slabinfo, and
/proc/*/status shows as if an increasing amount of memory is unaccounted
for. As an example (details below) consider the following:
  Used memory: 108 MB
  Buffers:       1 MB
  Cached:       10 MB
  Slabinfo:      3 MB
  Processes:    10 MB
Which obviously doesn't sum up. What am I missing? Any clue from a 
kind soul is appreciated.
TIA,
Oded.
Details:
# cat /proc/meminfo

slabsum.pl sums up the active pages in /proc/slabinfo. It works as
follows:
  while (<>) {
    s/([a-zA-Z]) ([a-zA-Z])/$1\_$2/;
    ($name, $active_obj, $total_obj, $size, $active_slabs,
$total_slabs, $pages)= split;
    $sum+= $total_slabs*$pages;
  }
  print $sum*4096;
# slabsum.pl < /proc/slabinfo
2498560
The following sums up the resident size of running processes. It
ignores shared memory issues, so it is at least as large as the actual
memory used (reported in kB):
# grep VmRSS: /proc/*/status | awk '{s+= $2; print s}' | tail -1
10164
No ipcs shared memory:
# ipcs
------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key       shmid     owner     perms     bytes     nattch    status
------ Semaphore Arrays --------
key       semid     owner     perms     nsems     status
------ Message Queues --------
key       msqid     owner     perms     used-bytes  messages
