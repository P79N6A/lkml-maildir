Yes - But I had to change from SB16 to PAS16. Weird. I had sound in quake
until the change back in 129 then I heard from Heikke (sp?) that she had a
PAS16 working fine. So I just switched to the PAS16 and Quake worked fine.
Another data point - Paul who works in the office here has an original
AWE32 and it works fine with Quake in 132. Just for kicks we tried my SB16
in his machine and it did not work. Only difference is something about his
SB rev code being like 4.13 and mine is 4.16 (or something that is .03
difference)
