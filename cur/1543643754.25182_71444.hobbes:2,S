The problem is that you're going to leave out details to do this. 
This means that even the experts don't know what happened. 
From the reported message I was able to pinpoint the exact spot on
his hdb2 partition where his drive has a bad spot, and I can calculate
the size of his hdb1 partition (In this case probably unneccesary
information, but still...). 
If the error message says something like: 
	"your harddrive hdb seems to be failing. Replace it NOW!"
then I can't make a valid decision about this. I have had a WD 31600
drive which had the trouble that the last 400M would go "bad": Lots of
bad blocks. In that situation I had to monitor the drive to just have
bad blocks in the last 400M or so, while I used only the first 1000M.
(Yes, only for "tmp" stuff.)
I also have a drive that has exactly ONE bad block. Run it through
"badblocks", and you can use the disk just fine. A read-ahead
might hit on the bad block, leading to funny error messages. However
I DO need to know which block.
MAC and Windows both try to give "simple" error messages. As a 
knowledgeable person I then am confronted with:
	"Something went wrong. Contact your sysadmin if you can't
	fix it yourself". 
Well, I -=AM=- the sysadmin, and would like to know what went wrong. 
Otherwise I can't fix it. This is NOT the way to go.
