Maybe... I've got a patch for that variation too.

Brrr... I don't like that. If I'm going to pass in a second argument, then I
want it to be what Christoph's version because it's more readable and more
obvious what it's doing (and, since the value is constant, the optimiser can
obviously get rid of it easily). I don't think gcc is going to be a problem in
that respect since the activity member is not volatile.
