make defconfig compiled ok.  modules are enabled, although only
"kernel/drivers/net/dummy.ko" exist.
It is bootable on my system in spite of P4 cpu selected in .config while
mine is a PIII.
And "lsmod" returns only the header row.  (A good sing for me)
Here is my first problem:  (This problem exist since v2.5.49, and up to
v2.5.52)
In will be talk about the following 4 lines below:
=============================
General setup  --->
Loadable module support  --->
Processor type and features  --->
============================     
1.	I ssh into my box, terminal is ANSI, rows=25, columns=80
a.	Just after "make menuconfig", what I get is:
The letter 'P' is actuall at Column 5
=============================
General setup  --->
Loadable module support  --->
Processor type and features  --->
============================     
b.	Press <down arrow> once, what I get is:
The letter 'P' is actuall at Column 5
The letter 'C' and second 'G' is actuall at Column 15
=============================
                Code maturity level options  --->
General seGeneral setup  --->
Loadable module support  --->
Processor type and features  --->
============================     
c.	If I kept pressing <down arrow>, the first letter of the current
title will be overlay to the column 15 of the current, for each line.
2.	If I "make menuconfig" in Console, where terminal is "linux",
the "horizontal displacement" still occur but only at 2 columns to the
right hand side only.
3.	The same problem for v2.4.20
Is this a know bug?  Where should I search before posting here?
