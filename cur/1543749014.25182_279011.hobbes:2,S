Care to add a comment with this information?  Driver-global locks are
something we tend to avoid, and cases like this one where it's actually
nessecary should be properly documented.

This is missing some space, should be:
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

Put this into the header or at least ontop of the file?

Missing spaces again.

Dito.  (And a few more)
