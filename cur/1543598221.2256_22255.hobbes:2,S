Wouldn't that involve fixing login, sshd, and all other
programs using pam to set the limits before fork()ing ?
I know the pam library is responsible for setting the
user limits, but it's the program linked to libpam which
is responsible for the order in which the other things
are done, right ?
(then again, I don't know enough about the userspace side
of things here, I'd be happy if somebody could enlighten
me)
cheers,
Rik
