My card [I should say chipset - built in to mobo] initialised partially.
[Running 2.4.3-ac5]

I believe I saw something like this, but the sound subsystem
initialised, it was just the gameport that was dead.
I resurrected it by cat'ing the following into /proc/isapnp
card 0 YMH0802
dev 0 YMH0022
port 0 0x201
activate
What does your /proc/isapnp say?
