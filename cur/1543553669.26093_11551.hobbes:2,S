I don't think that is reasonable.
The first thing most drivers do is reset the hardware.   That inevitably
leads to some sort of blip, when it comes to sound drivers.  If you
-don't- reset the hardware, the driver is using hardware that is in an
unknown state.  (using hardware w/out resetting it == unknown state)
You are depending on the hardware to keep its state -between- driver
unload and driver reload.  That seems inherently unstable to me.  It
amazes me that such is supported.
