| In many ways, that is exactly what SATA is. :)
Until multiple devices be string are available SATA will have logistical
problems scaling. The small cable is an advantage running a few drives
in a box, but a server with 40 drives or so would go from a cable bundle
out the back, about 5cm by 1 cm, to a real bunch of those little round
cables running everywhere. Certainly doable, but I think I'd name the
server "Medusa" if I built it.
I believe SATA-2 will address this, if I may believe what's projected
for an unwritten standard.
