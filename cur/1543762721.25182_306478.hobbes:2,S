"Nota  bene:  if  the  deltas  being  commented have been committed to a
 changeset and have been pulled out  of  this  repository,  the  comment
 changes  will  not  propagate on the next bk pull.  It is strongly sug-
 gested that you use this only on  uncommitted  deltas  which  have  not
 been  pulled  or cloned.  In the future, we will add a way of enforcing this."
That would suggest otherwise.
