btw., this 5GB+ of compressed source code means (using conservative 
calculations, and taking code duplication across projects and packages 
into account), that the raw linecount of the OSS source codebase 
distributed via Debian has exceeded half a billion (500 million) lines 
of code. Wow!
That makes Linux and OSS the largest man-made science project in
history. It also means that the cost of redeveloping the Debian codebase
using commerical methods could exceed 100 billion US dollars. [Sidenote:
no wonder the only remaining anti-Linux company (MS) is worried - they
are quite big and rich, but no way can they hold up against such type of
grass-roots exponential growth, and they know it.]
