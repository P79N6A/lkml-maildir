These are basically #if 0 ... #endif blocks with an activation switch
conveniently placed at the top of the .c file.  In the quoted example,
the effect of the activation switch is also documented by a comment.
Of course we should restrain ourselves WRT the use of #if 0 ... #endif
blocks in in-tree code, but sometimes they have sensible applications.
