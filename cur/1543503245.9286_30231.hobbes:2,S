Following my own posting.
An idea have just come to my mind.
I could modify the data in the received frame an pass it to bridge code.
By modifying data I mean change the incomming Ethernet interface,
IP-addresses, (MAC addresses?), message type etc. Have to check the 
sk_buff struct. This way the br_receive_frame() would do the job, no 
need to go to IP-level code.
Any networking wizard having few spare minutes to comment on this one?
Any hints, comments etc. are wellcome.
Regards,
Chris
