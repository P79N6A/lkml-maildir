No.  I just view them as a backing store type system.  Yes, if you use
unionfs in an nfs context you better be sure about how the nfs backing
store is going to be used (i.e. read-only or only used by a single
user), just like if you put ext2/3 on a san block device, you better be
sure that either its only used read-only or only used by a single user.
Yes, unionfs enables you to use the backing store "incorrectly", but so
do ext2/3 or any other non clustered file system when used on a SAN.
