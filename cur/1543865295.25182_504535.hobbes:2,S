Yep, that's precisely what was addressed in the part you snipped. 
My main point being that what to do about the remaining workload
should be dependent on the size of the I/O. If we encounter errors on
sectors 4,5,6,7,8.. of a 1MB request, we should have a threshold for
giving up. It's not unreasonable for that threshold to be larger than
1, but it should not be 2048.
And if we do the I/O as four 256KB requests, we should have
approximately the same number of retries (assuming the whole region's
bad).
