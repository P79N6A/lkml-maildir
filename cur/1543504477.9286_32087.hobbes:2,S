No, this is still a no-go.
POSIX signal semantics say that traps go to the faulting thread; only if
they're not handled, the whole process is killed (and leaves a coredump).
So we can't send the signal to other threads in the process before we know
that it should have produced a core dump.
And, besides, at least _my_ plan is to implement the signal semantics
entirely in userspace using existing process group semantics.
