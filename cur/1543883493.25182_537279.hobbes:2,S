Right. Simply because these lists are assembled by someone
- who knows how to pick that reports from the mailinglists
- who knows how to sort them in a useful way
- who knows how to add the relevant folks on CC

No it failed not. It is not perfect. Way more bugs, which have been
fixed or are in the debugging process, would have been unnoticed and
ignored otherwise.
