Subject: Determining if a process blocks on a system call

hello,
  If a process is executing a system call and if the
concerned resource(like pipereadend waiting for data
from write end) is not available I want to insert the
process back into the runqueue and not to the wait
queue. For that, how can I determine whether the
process blocks or not while executing that system
call.
Can anyone help me regarding this?
Regards,
selva
