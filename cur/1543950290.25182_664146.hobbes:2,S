Thanks, I queued these for 2.6.25.
Greg has a memstick-convert-struct-class_device-to-struct-device.patch at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-01-driver-core
which still applies and compiles on top of these changes, but I didn't of
course check whether it works at runtime.
It would be good if you were to review and runtime-test his patch, if you
have not yet done so.  Testing next -mm would be a suitable way of doing
that (it wasn't in 2.6.25-rc3-mm1).
