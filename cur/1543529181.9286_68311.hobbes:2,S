As you've probably seen, Alan Cox corrected me on that: Whilst
xconfig has no official maintainer, it gets tweaked by the config
and menuconfig maintainers, plus lots of other people, as and
when they see fit to fix something in it.

I have to admit that surprises me, and suggests that there was a
bug in the config.in scripts somewhere. Of the three, xconfig is
inherently more forgiving of bugs than config or menuconfig.

Most probably.

Hardly - most of the boxes I set up don't even get X installed on
them. Personally, I prefer menuconfig, and from the comments I've
seen over the years, most people agree with me.

If you can find them, they'll be very much appreciated.
Best wishes from Riley.
