Oh, I agree.
But this is a code interface issue, in my opinion. I suspect the
interfaces in the serial case are just not very good, and a bad interface
will force people to duplicate code (possibly with small changes) just
because it's a bad interface.
Getting to a good interface is non-trivial, but in the end it's the most
important thing anybody can do. Once you have good interfaces, you can
then get to the point where sharing is easy without having the potential
downsides.
I definitely wouldn't argue about some tty layer and serial code changes.
