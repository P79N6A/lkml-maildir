Ah, yes, I know what this is (and can reproduce it) and I don't
have a fix as yet.  This is an unrelated problem - basically,
we are doing kmem_cache_alloc with __GFP_NOFAIL set within XFS,
but the allocations are failing and returning NULL (but we are
assuming they will not).
You (and I) are hitting this more frequently now because Linus'
patch bypasses the slab allocator and is more expensive in terms
of memory used.  However, I have heard of one person who hit this
"in the wild" too, so its something we will need to address.
[ Christoph, is this failure expected?  I think you/Steve made
some changes there to use __GFP_NOFAIL and assume it wont fail?
(in 2.4 we do memory allocations differently to better handle
failures, but that code was removed...) ]

I expect that this is a similar issue to the above, but from
ext2/3's point of view.

FWIW and IIRC, we didn't push any XFS changes (nothing major
anyway, that I could foresee causing this) on to Linus in
between -test9 and -test11.
cheers.
