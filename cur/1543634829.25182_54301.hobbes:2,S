This originally was asking for help regarding QLA2200's, but I've since
discovered it's a kernel param problem that I'm not sure how to solve.
Using a default RH kernel (from SGI XFS installer) and passing
max_scsi_luns=128 in grub, and for scsi_mod, it seems to work. 
But when I compile my own kernels, none of that stuff is modular, it's
all built in. I though that passing max_scsi_luns at boot time would
make the scsi subsystem just work with > 8 luns, but so far that doesn't
appear to be the case. 
Can someone please tell me where I've gone wrong? I'm so deep into this,
I can't tell which way is up. 
TIA
