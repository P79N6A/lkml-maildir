Nice idea.
It would be even nicer if you could allow a couple of them. Partition
the RT priorities into a few classes and have an own limit for each them.
A small number of classes (3-4) would be probably enough and not bloat
the rlimits too much.
I'm thinking of the case where you have different kinds of real
time processes. Like your mp3 player which you want to be slightly
real time, but with a low SIGXCPU limit. 
And then something else real time which is more important and
you would set a higher limit. etc.
