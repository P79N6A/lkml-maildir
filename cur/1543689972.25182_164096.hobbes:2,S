Usually the whole L1 cache is flushed between appliation context
switches anyway, so the cost of a miss is borne by the application
which causes it.
And that _still_ doesn't change the truth of my statement.  One cycle
saved in a loop which executes 1000 times is worth more than an L1
i-cache miss, always.

Yes, of course that is better when it is possible.
Modern OOO CPUs are subtle beasts.  Like I said, I added a single
"nop" (one-byte instruction) to a tight graphics loop once, and the
loop went significantly faster.  I could not explain it, except that I
know the Pentium Pro instruction decode stage has many quirks.

Those were written before GAS had a macro facility.  I agree with you,
it should be used more in the kernel.
The two examples you gave have been carefully tuned on particular
CPUs, by trial and error.  Changing the instruction order makes a big
difference to their performance.
