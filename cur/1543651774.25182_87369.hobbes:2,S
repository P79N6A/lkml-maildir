  Will  vmalloc()  help ?  The allocated memory is in special
  vmalloc address space (which is limited!) within the kernel,
  but accesses to it go via page-mapping tables, thus while it
  is virtually contiguous, physically it might be well scattered.
  What properties do you need, to be exact ?
  You are writing some sort of a device driver for a device that
  has somewhat stupid direct-memory-access facilities ?

  Both  kmalloc()  and  vmalloc()  allocate kernel space memory that
  is unswappable, and therefore can not be allocated in excessive
  amounts.
  Doing things in BIGMEM fashion will let you have gigabytes of
  in-core memory, but to access it, you must go thru the hoops
  (in i686 architecture) each time you access a page of it.
