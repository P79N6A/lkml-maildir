Hi,
i've bought a new Motherboard: Asrock K8S8X (SiS 755 based)
It's running pretty fine, but i can only use 448MB of my 512MB memory.
So here's why:
   Checking aperture...
   CPU 0: aperture @ e0000000 size 32 MB
   Aperture from northbridge cpu 0 too small (32 MB)
   AGP bridge at 00:00:00
   Aperture from AGP @ e0000000 size 32 MB (APSIZE 38)
   Aperture from AGP bridge too small (32 MB)
   Your BIOS doesn't leave a aperture memory hole
   Please enable the IOMMU option in the BIOS setup
   This costs you 64 MB of RAM
   Mapping aperture over 65536 KB of RAM @ 4000000
This is what the kernel tells me when booting.
I already mailed to Asrock that this might be an issue with their BIOS, 
but the answer was very "untechnical":
   We did not test Linux.
   If you need Linux driver, please check from SiS Web Site.
   www.sis.com.tw
The problem is, that i don't know enought to decide, if this is an issue 
than can be fixed in the Linux-Kernel or if this problem should/must be 
fixed in the BIOS. There is no IOMMU-Option in the BIOS.
Thx
   Sven
