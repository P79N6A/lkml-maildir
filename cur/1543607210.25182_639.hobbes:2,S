Hello,
Why after kernel panic in 2.4.x it is not possible to do anything? It is
little annoying that, for example after entering wrong partition into
root=<>, I have to press reset key. It is not even possible to check
kernel messages (like names assigned to scsi and ide devices) with
Shift-PageUp. And ofcourse, during next boot, all raid arrays need to be
rebuild. 2.2.x kernels do not have this feature.
Best regards,
				Krzysztof Oledzki
