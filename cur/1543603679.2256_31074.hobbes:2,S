I am using a Promise 20267 in an DEC Alpha XL 300 with kernel 2.4.10-ac4.
That machine has no bios-support for IDE-Drives, but the kernel (booting
from the ncr scsi-controller) detects my 60gb ibm-disk without problems
and does about 20mb/s.
I've got one real problem:
When I do a "shutdown -r now", the machine is completely dead when loading
the ide-driver after booting up (module).
The only way to get the machine up again is power-cycling.
"shutdown -h now" followed by power-cycle works.
And just now, trying to find out the exact harddisk-model for this mail:
# cat /proc/ide/ide2/hde/identify
-> *boom*, machine dead, network unreachable
Shit - will have to drive to work tomorrow to get my private webserver
back running :(
