I was confusing the two. I was trying to envision the interface 
from the channel driver's view, which I still understand to be an
ioctl interface for control by the entity that implements the negotiation.
The PPP options could be specified in the ioctl as a variable length
block encoded in the same fasion as an LCP frame (starting with
the LCP protocol ID). This way as new RFCs are added, the format
of the call would not change. I'm not suggesting any LCP type negotiation,
just a simple list of options that are supported or have been negotiated.

Where does the 'frame' begin? If the media specific PPP options are
implemented in the channel driver, then I would assume it starts at
the protocol ID field?
If possible, inform me any early implementations, so I can add these
interfaces to our driver and help with testing.
