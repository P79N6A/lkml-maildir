How about those other architectures, than i386 ?
Over the years I have learned, that while GCC may work OK in i386,
the same version used in SPARC does produce bad code.  This has
bitten me multiple times.
We weird people of other architechtures do tend to get "somewhat"
conservative over the years in finding, and finally staying with
a compiler that we have learned to work.   Multiple burned,
forever shy...
