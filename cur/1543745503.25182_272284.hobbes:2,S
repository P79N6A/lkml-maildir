That's why you could use a wrapper.

The wrapper could also not be part of the regular execution, and
you'd only use it if you really need it, much like nice, chroot,
etc.

I'm extremely sceptical about solutions that require the user to
quantify things. In the world of QoS, if you give users a knob
to play with, the'll stare at in confusion, and ask for the
"faster" button. I don't think the OOM case is much different.
A "victim" (or a "precious") flag has the advantage that the user
doesn't need to estimate peak demands, but still doesn't depend
solely on the verdict of some arcane algorithm working behind
the scenes.

Good idea. That would also help with the problem of browsers
immediately asking to be brought back to life, so that they can
spin the banner ads some more.
