Dear all,
is it possible to explicitly tell the kernel to prioritize PCI traffic
for a number of cards in pci slots x,y,z ?
I am asking as severe ide traffic causes lost frames when watching TV
using 2 DVB cards + vdr... This is simply due to the fact that the PCI
bus is saturated...
So, is any prioritizing of the PCI bus possible ?
Best
Soeren
