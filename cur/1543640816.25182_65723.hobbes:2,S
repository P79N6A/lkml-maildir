I am not so sure. The KDKBDREP is a very recent (2.4test/prerelease-to-final)
addition to the stock kernel. The kbdrate program is much older, and of course
used /dev/port - we had this discussion not too long ago.
Today kbdrate tries (i) KDKBDREP, (ii) KIOCSRATE, (iii) /dev/port.
What it does for KDKBDREP is conform the text of kd.h, and I think
conform what m68k has done for years (but I've never seen the m68k patch).
Alan Stern is entirely right that the current 2.4 kernels and the
current kbdrate program have different ideas about what KDKBDREP does.
One of the two has to be fixed. Preferably in such a way that ancient
m68k behaviour does not change. Does anyone have this old m68k patch?
