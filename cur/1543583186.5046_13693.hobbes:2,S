I remember auditing the exact code where this happens, but on 2.0 or earlier.
I had written a simple program 10-20 lines C to count pulses at rate of 1 per
second give or take.  It turned out that the driver disabled the UART's
generation
of interrupts completely for certain signals.  I don't remember which
exactly, but
I think it was DCD; I was using CLOCAL so the hangups wouldn't close the
descriptor.  The problems was that by disabling the interrupt at the source,
the ioctl's to read the bits stopped working!  not what I wanted.
I'm afraid I can't help, other that to suggest that that behaviour can have
problems.
The extra irq traffic was probably the motivation for this optimisation, but
I don't know of anyone's modem hanging up frequently enough to measure the
extra load.  Only people crazy enough to use the built-in serial port ($0)
as opposed to an $500 industrial digital io card are likely to care though...
