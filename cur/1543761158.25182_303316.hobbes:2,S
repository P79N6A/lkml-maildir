I don't think that's what's happening.  The kernel is perfectly happy to read 
data into any virtual address range that your process can legally write to - 
this includes any part of the heap and any part of the stack.  The kernel 
can't check whether writing to the given address would clobber the stack or 
heap - it's your memory, you manage it.  The kernel's notion of an "invalid 
address" is very simple, and doesn't include every address that you would 
consider invalid from a C perspective.
So what's probably happening is that your stack is (1632+256) bytes tall, 
including the buffer you allocated.  (Stack grows downward on i386.)  So 
ideally you read less than 256 bytes.  If you read more than 256 but less 
than 1888 bytes, the read would damage other elements on the stack, but it is 
OK as far as the kernel is concerned.  But if you read more than that, you're 
asking the kernel to write to an address that is higher than the highest 
address of the stack (the address of the bottom element), and this address 
isn't mapped into your process, so you get EINVAL.
If you were to type more than 256 (but less than 1888) characters before 
pressing enter, the read would silently overflow the buffer, thus clobbering 
the stack, including the return address of main().  So when main tried to 
return, you'd get a segfault.  Somebody with assembly skills could probably 
craft a string which, when your program reads it, would take control of the 
program.

No army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come.
