I'm glad you realise this.  The Netware method you mention above sounds
over complicated for the desired end result, and the NT method just sounds
like a gross hack.
The current 'compile for the arch you intend to run on' is right now,
the simplest, cleanest way to do this.
If you manage to pull something off in MANOS or whatever other OS,
to prove all this otherwise (without resorting to ugly hacks like the
above), great for you, I (and I assume others) would like to hear
about it.
regards,
Davej.
