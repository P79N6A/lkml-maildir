Is this (printing out versions. etc) really a big deal so we should add stuff 
like "/proc/xxx", KERN_XXXX to make things more complicated?  It sounds to me 
like to make the kernel "smaller" we'd actually end up with adding more code 
and complexity to it.  And quite frankly, if people don't read MAINTAINERS, 
they won't read /proc/maintainers either.
