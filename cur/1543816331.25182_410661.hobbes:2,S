The `= 0;' causes this to consume space in vmlinux's .data.  If we put it
in bss and let crt0.o take care of zeroing it, we save a little disk space.

That's potentially quite a few atomically-allocated pages.  I guess UML is
more resistant to oom than normal kernels (?) but it'd be nice to be able to
run page reclaim here.

rofl.  We really ought to have a #define for "this architecture's maximum
length of an asciified int/long/s32/s64".  Generally people do
guess-and-giggle-plus-20%, or they just get it wrong.

 * NOTE: Currently, only shmfs/tmpfs is supported for this operation.
 * Other filesystems return -ENOSYS.
Are you expecting that this memory is backed by tmpfs?
