I don't know what you really mean by "implementing ACPI" here. Certain 
queries may generate SMM traps, but I haven't seen any event driven code 
paths that do[1]. If you're polling hardware you may generate some 
latency, but I don't think that's any great surprise.
It would be interesting to have a test case under Linux so we could 
attempt to figure out whether it's an actual problem, or just Windows 
doing awkward things.
[1] outside sort of obvious stuff like ripping out a hotswap bay and 
/potentially/ critical battery status to switch on a warning light, but 
if you hit those situations you're probably pretty much dead anyway
