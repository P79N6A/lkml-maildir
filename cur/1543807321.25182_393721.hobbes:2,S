As others have reported on lkml ("Bad interaction between uhci_hcd and 
de2104x"), I'm having problems with de2104x driver. I removed usb-ehcd, 
but that alone didn't seem to help (other NICs doesnt work). Not loading 
de2104x does though.
The oops I got without USB can be seen at:

Now, I dont even use this NIC, and I probably wont for some time or 
ever, considering its 10Mbit or something. I only have it to have a 
spare port "incase I need it", which I havent yet =).
If anyone feels like debugging this though, feel free to tell me what to 
provide in the way of info etc. and Ill try to help.
