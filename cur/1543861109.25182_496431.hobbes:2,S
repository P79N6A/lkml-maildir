Didn't I?  
The proof goes like this:
	we only take the semaphore if tty->count == 1, in which case
we are opening the device for the first time and there can't be anyone
else looking at it, so the mutex_lock won't sleep.
However, now that you're making me think about it again, I'm wondering
about the sanity of introducing a mutex which is guaranteed not to
sleep.
This is starting to make sense, with (tty->count > 1) being the
OPENING flag:

Then, I think the mutex can just be thrown away.
