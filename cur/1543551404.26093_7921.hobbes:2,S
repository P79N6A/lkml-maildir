Hi there,
as of devfs and devfsd Xterm seems to need suid bit set so that chown
of /dev/pts/{pts number} can be done. devpts fs does not need it.
So it is buggy devfs/devfsd or it is a feature?
The first allocation of pts number has good ownership but if it is freed
and another allocation is done by different user pts number has still
ownership of firt allocation if Xterm is not suid. In Red Hat Xterm is
no more suid.
