I'd prefer to avoid lists unless there is some overriding concern, like a
real implementation issue. But I don't care much one way or the other -
what I care about is that the setup and usage time is as low as possible.
I suspect arrays are better for that.
I have this strong suspicion that networking is going to be the most
latency-critical and complex part of this, and the fact that the
networking code wanted arrays is what makes me think that arrays are the
right way to go. But talk to Davem and ank about why they wanted vectors.
