two things
1. linux shouldn't take longer to boot then windows (and if properly 
configured it doesn't)
2. there's a _long_ way between the current situation where a driver can 
spew 500+ lines of logging and there being so little logging that people 
don't know what's going on.
if you are on a slow console (say a serial console) just letting the boot 
messages scroll by can take quite a while today.
