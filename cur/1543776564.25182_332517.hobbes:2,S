Hi!
You know what I think about plugins, right? There are already plugins
at block device level, like raid5, LVM, device mapper... I do not see
why you should need another one.

Why the cast and why long in the first place?

How often are you doing this? Would hash table be prefered? How many
plugins do you have? Maybe statical registration is right solution?
