Not memory fragmentation, language definition fragmentation. 
There is no language called "LISP" (except the original). There are several 
dozen strains with slighly or very different syntax, scope rules and other 
variations. LISP1.5, MacLisp, Emacs Lisp, AutoLisp, Common Lisp, Scheme to 
mention a very few of the more known species, and most of these come in 
different dialects.
