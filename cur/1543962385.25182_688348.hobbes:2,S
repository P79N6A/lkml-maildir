(Subject modeled upon the "Who wrote 2.6.x" series from LWN)
Hello everyone,
following the implied "suggestion" of David Miller to track reverts in 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120959059828048&w=2
 , I stitched 
together a short script that evaluates the commit log summary and prints 
a overview who has the most reverts and who got reverted most. There are 
surprisingly few revert commits -- currently, perhaps because, as he 
says, a "reluctance to even suggest reverts".
One thing I noticed is that reverts are not always marked with the word 
"revert" in the summary line even though it normally would be, for 
example
	6b8e1c7e x86: 8K stacks by default
	d61ecf0b x86: 4kstacks default
(People evading the revert statistics?)
So that is not counted, but I wanted to make aware of it.
Stats are below.
> git log v2.6.25..linus/master --pretty="format:<%an>%s" | ./git-revert-stats
 P#  COMM#  NAME --- Top people doing the revert:
  1      1  Paul Mackerras
  2      1  David S. Miller
  3      1  Ingo Molnar
  4      1  Andrew Morton
