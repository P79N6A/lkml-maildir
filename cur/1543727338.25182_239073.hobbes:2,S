Actually that was "-vv" (two v's, not double-v), but don't bother.
The dmesg output shows this is a HID failure.  It's likely connected
with some changes in the unlink logic, since that's what returns
the "-ENOENT" status.  The usb_kill_urb() changes added a new
URB state as I recall, maybe that's part of the issue here... since
that routine replaced the previous "synchronous unlink" logic.
