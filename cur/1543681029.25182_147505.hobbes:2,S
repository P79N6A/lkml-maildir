This is funny. Every time I found something interesting to read (papers) I
print them and I stock on my desk. The are 25Kg of papers piled on my desk
right now. Thanks to you, 25.05Kg now ;) Upon a brief read, The Italian Job,
hemm ... paper, is very similar to SOFTRR. Once you change their "server"
notion with the per-user allocation I have in mind, it'll come even
closer. I really didn't have time to read the MS paper though. The problem
is not if it can be done, the problem is how bad ppl wants it.
