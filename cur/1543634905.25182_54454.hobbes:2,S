Hi, all,
	I'm curious that if a network card interrupt happens at the same
time as the kernel timer expires, what will happen?
	It's said the kernel timer is guaranteed accurate. But if
interrupts are not masked off, the network interrupt also should get
response when a kernel timer expires. So I don't know who will preempt
who.
	Thanks for information!
