Are you sure that your CF adapter has the DMA lines hooked up? See 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/23/198
 for instance - IIRC, the kernel has 
no way of telling whether the failure is because the card supports DMA 
and the adapter doesn't, or whether the card is lying. If it's the 
former, the card shouldn't be blacklisted.
