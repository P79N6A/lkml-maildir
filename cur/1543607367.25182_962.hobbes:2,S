I don't think it is a big problem. We can add virtual nodes. They way I
see it we either
	a) put in grungy subsystem hacks
	b) register virtual device nodes for subsystems when needed
b feels cleaner

Sound is more easily handled by not blocking user space but waiting until
the final IRQ off moment and grabbing the registers. That avoids a lot
of ugly locking gunge. It literally comes down to
	case suspending
		kmalloc buffer
		done
	case final suspend point
		turn off DMA
		readl
		readl
		readl
		readl
		...
		done
