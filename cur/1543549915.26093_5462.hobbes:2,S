So runtime checks don't have to be made. If you don't have DMA, the
functions just return -EINVAL (so they must return a value). Otherwise,
they don't return a value because they 'printk' their own diagnostic
message.

It does not 'blindly' write. The kernel has allocated a whole page as
a buffer. See ../linux/fs/proc/array.c, line 1517. This is only called
by kernel code that has already allocated a buffer so no checking is
necessary.
