I have filters set up so that my mailer puts all mm-commits messages 
from the mailing list into a special "mm-commits" folder.  Each time 
Andrew releases an -mm kernel, I rename my "mm-commits" folder to 
"mm-commits-%version%", such as "mm-commits-2.6.13-rc3-mm2"  (I will 
probably have to create a folder like this tomorrow, or in a few 
hours/days ;-) ... Then I create a new "mm-commits" folder to hold all 
new patches not yet in the latest -mm kernel.  As of right now, my 
current "mm-commits" mail folder has 153 patches in it, although I think 
I may have lost a patch or two...
ALSO, somebody has created a -git tree that pulls from the mm-commits 
list (i think) ... Anyway, I looked at the git tree last night and it 
seems to be delayed by a few days.  I dont have that link handy right 
now.  Does anybody else have it?
