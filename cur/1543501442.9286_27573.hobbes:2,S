Hi all
If I have this structure in a header file (NB: this is taken from MS C):
---------------
typedef volatile struct
{
        short           RomStat;        /* ROM Status Word */
        unsigned short  RomCmd;         /* ROM Command Word */
        unsigned short  RomErr;         /* ROM Error Word */
        unsigned short  DLStart;        /* Download start location */
        unsigned short  BoardType;      /* ACL Family product type */
} ACL_ROM;
---------------
and this statement in a C file:
---------------
        ACL_ROM *rom;
        unsigned long dpaddr=0xD000; /* address of dual port RAM */
<snip, snip>
        rom = (ACL_ROM *) MK_FP((dpaddr >> 4), 0); /* make a far pointer to
the dual port */
---------------
What would the equivialent be to the above statement in the Linux universe.
Also, in the book "Linux device drivers", Chapter 6: Flow of Time, under
Delaying Execution, the recommended method of waiting for an event to happen
is:
---------------
int delay_i ( int njiffies )
{
current->timeout = jiffies + njiffies;
current->state =  TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
schedule();     /* wait for  njiffies/HZ  sec */
return 0;
}
---------------
Only problem is current->timeout does not seem to exist in 2.3.x, what is it
replaced by, or better still, what is the recommended method in 2.3?
TIA
Colin
