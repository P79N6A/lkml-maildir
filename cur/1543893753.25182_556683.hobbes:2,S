Andi, Andrew,
any reaction to the submission for upstream inclusion below? We have put 
a lot of effort into it but this work is currently blocked by apparent 
silence from the x86_64 maintainer. Thanks,
	Ingo

The following patch series contains:
- dyntick bugfixes for -mm (caused by the cpuidle changes in ACPI)
- updates and improvements to high resolution timer / dynticks 
- high resolution timer / dynticks support for x86_64
The x86_64 support is based on an initial patch from Chris Wright. 
Thanks Chris !
The patch set has been tested in the -hrt and -rt trees for quite a 
while and the initial problems have been sorted out. Thanks to the folks 
from the PowerTop project for testing and feedback.
The -hrt tree at 
http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.22-rc4/
 
contains also an hpet force patch series from Venki Pallipadi, but I 
leave this up to Venki to send it mainline wards.
Thanks,
	tglx
