Did you read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt? If you have 1G of
ram and not many active processes, you might get a *lot* of queueing if your
settings are a bit off. 
I ran this for you on my favorite overworked Linux box. It processes 50% of
the incoming and outgoing mail of ~50.000 cable modem subscribers, without a
flaw:
[root@smtpe vm]# uname -a ; for a in * ; do echo $a: ; cat $a; echo ; done
