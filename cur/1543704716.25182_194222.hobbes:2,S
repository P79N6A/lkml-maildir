> It looks like one can make a preprocessor or even one's own compiler (with one's syntax) which will be used for kernel building. But it's not required to distribute this compiler. So I can distribute linux kernel source code modified this way but no one will be able to build it. Is it ok?
Only if those "compiler and other preprocessing tools" are normally 
distributed with the O/S the executable runs on. If you create your own 
compiler, and it's not "normally distributed", then you can't publish 
source code in that language under the GPL without making the compiler 
available as well.
