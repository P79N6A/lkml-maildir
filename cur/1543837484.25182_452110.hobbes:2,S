Generation numbers.
When the filesystem creates a new file it assigns a random number 
as the 'generation' number and stores that in the inode.
This gets included in the filehandle, and checked when the filehandle
lookup is done.
Look for references to 'i_generation' in fs/ext3/*
Other files systems may approach this slightly differently, but the
filesystem is responsible for providing a unique-over-time filehandle,
and 'generation number' is the 'standard' way of doing this.
