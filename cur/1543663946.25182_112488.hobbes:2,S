Cool, I agree 100% with this.

Again, I'm with you all the way on this.  If the scale up guys can adopt
this as a mantra, I'm a lot less concerned that anything bad will happen.
Tim at OSDL and I have been talking about trying to work out some benchmarks
to test for this.  I came up with the idea of adding a "-s XXX" which means
"touch XXX bytes between each iteration" to each LMbench test.  One problem
is the lack of page coloring will make the numbers bounce around too much.
We talked that over with Linus and he suggested using the big TLB hack to
get around that.  Assuming we can deal with the page coloring, do you think
that there is any merit in taking microbenchmarks, adding an artificial
working set, and running those?

That's really great, I know it's a lot less sexy but it's important.
I'd love to see as much attention on making Linux work on tiny embedded
platforms as there is on making it work on big iron.  Small is cool too.
