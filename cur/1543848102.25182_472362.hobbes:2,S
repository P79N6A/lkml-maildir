Here's another data point for your consideration. I've been seeing this 
error since I started running 2.6.18, I assumed it was hardware, so I've 
tried 3 different disks, a PATA and 2 SATA drives, with VIA and Promise 
controllers, the error has occurred on all of them. I see the error 
infrequently, always when downloading lots of small files from Usenet 
and building, copying and deleting large (200 - 300 MB). I haven't ever 
had an oops/panic, just this error.  When I run fsck, I always see a 
single message that "deleted inode nnn has zero dtime". I hope this will 
be useful.
