The build is broken for quite some v4l drivers already (zr36120,
zr36067, the mpeg card, afaik), and really, the ones not in the kernel
will not officially "support" 2.6.x anyway before it's stable. It
shouldn't be that much work. I'd suggest to try to get it in before
2.6.0. This whole "we'll now turn number 5->6 and everything will be
stable" is there to help developers in releasing a new stable version,
not to prevent them from innovating and improving. I mean, this won't
actually be a totally new subsystem like the VM that needs to be
debugged in the next few months just after we've release 2.6.0, right?
It's just a small move. Fixing the drivers shouldn't be hard, and if
we/you ("we" as in the v4l driver developers) synchronize that nicely
with each other, there shouldn't be an actual problem.
(Related, I [finally] got 2.6.0-test1 to work so a new patch for my
driver is coming up in one of the next few days; please, someone kick it
forward to Linus then).
