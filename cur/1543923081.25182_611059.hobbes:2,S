Nope, won't work.  I tried that last night.  VIDEO_DEV_SAA7146_VV
has too many "select"s involved, but select doesn't follow the dependency
chains.  IOW, as written in Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt:
	select is evil.... select will by brute force set a symbol
	equal to 'y' without visiting the dependencies. So abusing
	select you are able to select a symbol FOO even if FOO depends
	on BAR that is not set.
