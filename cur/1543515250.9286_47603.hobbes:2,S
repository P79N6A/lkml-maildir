 What do people think of the following idea:
dedicate one page to (some) system information, so that
later programs can mmap it and have (read-only) inexpensive access to this
information.
The stuff that I can think right away would be useful in this page
are current time information, time since interrupt (for xserver for
example), available ram/swap..
This way a program can have, for example, cheap timestamps by simply
copying the data from mmaped device to whatever place it needs the
timestamp in.
