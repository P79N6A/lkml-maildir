Most of IDE code access IDE_BUSY flag when queue lock is held. So just 
move it inside lock everywhere... As side benefit you do not have to use 
atomic test_and_set then, you can use faster non-atomic (without lock prefix) 
equivalents.
In fact it looks to me like that only tcq's udma_tcq_start accesses
IDE_BUSY without holding queue lock, and it is only read access to print
some BUG()-like message.
