You need to recompile your kernel and ensure CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN is
not set:
Probe all LUNs on each SCSI device
CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN
  If you have a SCSI device that supports more than one LUN (Logical
  Unit Number), e.g. a CD jukebox, and only one LUN is detected, you
  can say Y here to force the SCSI driver to probe for multiple LUNs.
  A SCSI device with multiple LUNs acts logically like multiple SCSI
  devices. The vast majority of SCSI devices have only one LUN, and
  so most people can say N here and should in fact do so, because it
  is safer.
ide-scsi emulation exhibits the above symptoms when the option is set.
