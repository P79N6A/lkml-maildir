The FC kernel trees rpms and source rpms are distributed from the fedora
site. 'Production' kernels go to the updates directory, others which are
intended for testing go to the update testing directory and may or may
not work wonderfully.
RHEL kernel source trees are also on redhat.com, although I suspect they
are of somewhat limited interest to most of the development community.
