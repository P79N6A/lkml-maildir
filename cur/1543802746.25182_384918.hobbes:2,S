Subject: [PATCH 1/2] hugetlb: Delay page zeroing for faulted pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've come up with a much better idea to resolve the issue I mention
below.  The attached patch changes hugetlb_no_page to allocate unzeroed
huge pages initially.  For shared mappings, we wait until after
inserting the page into the page_cache succeeds before we zero it.  This
has a side benefit of preventing the wasted zeroing that happened often
in the original code.  The page_lock should guard against someone else
using the page before it has been zeroed (but correct me if I am wrong
here).  The patch doesn't completely close the race (there is a much
smaller window without the zeroing though).  The next patch should close
the race window completely.
