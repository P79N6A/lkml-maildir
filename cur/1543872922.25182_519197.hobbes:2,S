I got it wrong, and I didn't CC myself so I couldn't correct it in time.
If it was a security risk, it would exist right now, too, because of 
other access patterns.

CONFIG_WOMBAT
Waste memory, brain and time in order to grant an atomic write which is 
neither guaranteed by the standard nor expected by any sane programmer, 
just in case some idiot tries to write to one file from multiple 
processes.
Warning: Programs expecting this behaviour are buggy and non-portable.

If you asume that you won't have short writes, your programs may fail on
e.g. solaris. There may be reasons for linux to use the same semantics at 
some time in the future, you never know.
If you asume you *may* have short writes, you have no problem.

I think it may be well-hidden in menuconfig.
