This can be done in Linux from user-space: write a script that monitors
free swap space (grep SwapFree /proc/meminfo), and adds/removes new swap
files err... on-the-fly, or --even better-- just-in-time.
The unique feature that Mac OS X VM does have, on the other hand, is
that it keeps profiles of access patterns of applications, and stores
then in files, associated with executables. This allows to quickly
pre-fault necessary pages during application startup (and this makes OSX
boot so fast).
