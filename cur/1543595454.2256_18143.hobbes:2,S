Some code contains very long lines (around 150 characters per line) and others
tend to limit lines to 72-80 lines.
And strings have been broken in the middle _just_ to keep the lines short, and
sometimes without caring about the additional newline. In such cases, either,
the lines should be merged or a backslash should be added to the end(s) of the
line(s).
Please refer to my patch (GCC v3 warning fixes #1) for examples.
