Unfortunately, this is only an academic exercise -- I don't actually have any
IEEE1394 devices to test this driver with! *blushes*
However, a bug is a bug is a bug, so I reported it anyway. If it's absolutely
necessary, I think I can get my hands on some IEEE1394 stuff from a few people
I know and test it with that.
