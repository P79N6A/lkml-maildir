HEAD got replaced with head-y sometime in 2.5.
It's about time to rip out the last bits.
About head-y:
From Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt:
   The very first objects linked are listed in head-y, assigned by
      arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile.
And later:
    head-y, init-y, core-y, libs-y, drivers-y, net-y
            $(head-y) list objects to be linked first in vmlinux.
            $(libs-y) list directories where a lib.a archive can be located.
            The rest list directories where a built-in.o object file can be located.
            $(init-y) objects will be located after $(head-y).
            Then the rest follows in this order:
            $(core-y), $(libs-y), $(drivers-y) and $(net-y).
