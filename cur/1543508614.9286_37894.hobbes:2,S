Ah, I thought you was pointing out a bug because you quoted my "bigmem
it's safe" before talking about the swapout/cow bigmem iteraction.

Yes.

Yes but that's really a minor issue IMHO. The fact that we have to bounce
the bigmem-page in regular-memory is more sensitive than the
double-swapout-cow thing.

Yes that's true but I believe that's really _not_ the interesting reason
for using bounce buffers.

It depends. If they are all static there's no reason to worry. But if they
are dynamic we should think about the deadlock issues. Right now to do the
thing _safe_ they _have_ to be dynamic to remap every buffer that enter
in the ll_rw_block path and not only the req->bh. If we remap only the
req->bh then we can simply lose PAGE_SIZE*NR_REQUEST memory and we won't
risk to deadlock but that's not a real protection and it may break also
with DMA driven operations if the PCI bus is not capable to access
physical memory over 2gigabyte (see my previous email to Stephen).

No.
