In the interest of efficiency, I'll try Ivan's patch against -rc4 before
I do anything else (although I *do* have my git tree updated and ready
for abuse if it comes to that :-)).  New kernel is building: I'll be able
to test it in about five hours (when I can get back to where the machine
is).
As usual, thanks to everyone for the quick responses.
