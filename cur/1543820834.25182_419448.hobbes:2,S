For -mm then please Andrew? Trees are
git://git.infradead.org/hdrcleanup-2.6.git for the header cleanups
and git://git.infradead.org/hdrinstall-2.6.git for the 'make
headers_install'.
This has been compile-tested on ppc, ppc64, x86_64, i686, ia64, s390 and
s390x. The exported headers have been used as the basis for a
glibc-kernheaders package and then to build glibc on the same set of
architectures.
Btw, I note there's no rbtree-git in your 2.6.17-rc2-mm1. Anything I can
do to remedy that? Did I just imagine that you had included it in a
previous -mm?
