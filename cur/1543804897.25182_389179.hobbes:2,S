Hello,
i have a linux system running:
Linux www 2.6.14-gentoo-r2 #4 SMP Mon Nov 28 10:35:23 CET 2005 i686
Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.20GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
I have a Marvell Yukon Ethernet card inside.
And i have some trouble with it (see the attached log file).
I get tons of error messages in my kern.log, all the same:
Jan 15 11:11:20 www kernel: KERNEL: assertion (flags & MSG_PEEK) failed
at net/ipv4/tcp.c (1171)
Then, after some hours, the error message changes to something like
this:
Jan 15 17:58:44 www kernel: KERNEL: assertion
(flags & MSG_PEEK) fa->rcviled at net/ipv4/tcp.->rcv_nxt || (iled at

and then, after some days i have this gibberish:
