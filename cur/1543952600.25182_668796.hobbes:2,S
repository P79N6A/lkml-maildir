I agree. I didn't think ramback was just an advertising mechanism for 
violin, I thought it was being presented as something that could be used 
with enterprise hardware like the Sun x4600 (which can hold 256G of ram) 
and that talk of the violin was just the claim that lots of ram is 
available so this was a possibility now.

P.S. 8xPCI-e slots are only able to do 2GB/s of data transfer, in an 
earlier post Daniel claimed that you needed 3GB/s of disk to mirror to the 
disk, so the scenerio listed above looses 1/3 of it's performance compared 
to what was being claimed earlier.
