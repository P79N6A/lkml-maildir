Alex,
Thanks for your reply, it is really good if I have to load another kernel.
But in my case the OS on the hard disk could be Windows, Linux or x86
Solaris. A reboot is required from Linux booted from floppy/ramdisk after
the hard disk has been imaged with requested operating system by a user. 
Because of the automated behavior of this, changing the boot sequence is not
an option. That is why I am after executing real mode BIOS interrupts to
load the MBR and then pass control to it. 
Any help will be appreciated :)
Thanks
Aboo

You probably want to look at kexec.
