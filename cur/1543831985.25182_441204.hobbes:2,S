It compiles with no error and no warning, so I haven't noticed.  This is as
binfmt_elf.c is, I believe, so that is probably wrong too.

I don't know.  It probably should.

Again taken from binfmt_elf.c, although I added the debugging stuff.  It
shouldn't matter as the compiler will make its own decision (or does "inline"
get #defined to always-inline nowadays?).

Okay.

Again, stolen verbatim from binfmt_elf.c.  I'd prefer to keep it comparable by
the blink-comparator method if possible.

It shouldn't do; we own our own vma chain, and because we're part of exec, we
have a fresh mm_struct to play with.  The VMAs themselves aren't allowed to
change, not even on NOMMU.
