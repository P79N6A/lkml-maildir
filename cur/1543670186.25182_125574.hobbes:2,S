Hi again,
(Thanks for replying, John.)
I ran Memtest86, and there're 290 errors that showed up from test 7. But the
thing that I don't understand is, if I use either of the RAM modules alone,
Linux loads and runs perfectly for as long as I've tried; Could it possibly
be a problem with something besides the RAM (e.g. motherboard, CPU)? And I
still don't know if my RAM setup is even supported by Linux -- I'm guessing
that it is though (?).
