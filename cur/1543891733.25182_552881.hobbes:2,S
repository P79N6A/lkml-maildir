I understand, but this is exactly the situation that I'm complaining
about.  There is no functionality to provide a nonblocking open - no
ability to come back around and retry a given open call.

This is exactly my point - there is no asynchronous system call to do
this work, to my knowledge.  I will likely fix this in my own code
using threads, but I see using threads in this case as working around
that lack of systems interface.  Threads, imho, should be limited to
cases where I'm using them to distribute load across multiple
processors, not because the kernel interfaces for IO cannot support
nonblocking calls.
I'm speaking to my ideal world view - but any application I write
should not have to wait for the kernel if I don't want it to.   I
should be able to submit my request, and come back to it later as I so
decide.
(And I did actually consider writing my own NFS client for about 5 minutes.)
Thanks for the response!
