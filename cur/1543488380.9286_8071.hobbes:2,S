	I'm not picking on the fellow who sent this message, but I 
received considerable feedback in private on vendor-assigned 
MAC number -> vendor mapping message; that perhaps justifies sending a 
public message to l-kernel.  
	The RFC you want is 1700, aka "Assigned Numbers", around page
170 (per the document pagination) as I recall.  It's available at ISI's 
site or at any one of many web-based archives.
	Interesting side-note is that this rfc, like so many other 
important documents, was co-authored by Postel.  
Regards,
Daniel
