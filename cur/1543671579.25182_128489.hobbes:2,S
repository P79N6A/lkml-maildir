That's basically the gist of it. The "larger page" is purely a software
construct anyway, so the search and replace approach should be fine.
i.e. s/PAGE_SIZE/MMUPAGE_SIZE/ for the appropriate bits of GART drivers
It won't fix the issues with true hardware page sizes of larger than
4KB, but the issues raised by the larger software page size (really
get_free_pages() allocation unit) are very fixable there.
