just playing with the "softirq_raise" would be much simpler but I can
see only one problem: we don't know what cpu the tasklet is scheduled
into, so we don't know where to signal the local softirq.
So it seems to fix the looping problem of disabled tasklets we should
really dschedule the tasklet in tasklet_disable (and of course to forbid
it to be scheduled when disabled in tasklet_schedule) and later to
reschedule it in tasklet_enable.
The looping of disabled tasklets was intentional though, it's true as
you noted that if somebody disable a tasklet we'll keep wasting time on
it (ksofitrqd or not, we would waste time anyways at every irq etc..,
ksoftirqd just makes it visible with top which is a good thing rather
than having the overhead hided in the irq handler and in the scheduler),
but the idea was that by design disabled tasklets should remain disabled
for a little time.
Infact at the moment it's even impossible to remove a tasklet from the
queue if it remains disabled forever. tasklet_kill will deadlock on a
tasklet that is disabled.
Comments Linus?
