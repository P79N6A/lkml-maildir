Having credible "private" -nice tree would be enough, I guess.

My priorities are
* highmem support (there are notebooks with 2GB ram; I have one too
  close to me)
  [I have hacky patch for this for swsusp1; at least its short]
* smp support (HT notebooks are going to be more common, I'm afraid)
Important but not at price of modifying too many files outside
kernel/power
* refrigerator should work (but if you have NFS server mounted, and
  its down, you are on your own)
* even if all memory is used, it should be possible to suspend
"If it is very non-intrusive it might go in"
* esc interrupts
* I'd say that one compression method should be enough for everyone
Features I'd prefer not to see in -linus kernel
* splashscreen
* /proc configuration
