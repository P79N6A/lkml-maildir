All current cases are not embedded, synchronize_kernel() needs
"arg" :-)

I can't see how the ordering of the RCU updates matter, so we can 
trivially change things internally without affecting the interface. 
That said, I disagree about the bloat issue, I don't see a problem there, 
atleast not yet. All the uses that I have seen so far, the additional "prev"
pointer is a very small fraction of the total memory allocated for
the objects. And it is certainly not an issue with IPC - just look
at the values for SHMMNI, SEMMNI etc.

Grr... I thought Mingming's patch modified only IPC common code
and was looking at the mm6 tree directly. My earlier suggestion
is valid only if RCU head allocation is limited to grow_ary(). Otherwise,
rcu_head should be embedded.
