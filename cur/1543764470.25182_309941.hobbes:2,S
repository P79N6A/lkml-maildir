That is indeed correct wrt pathnames. The current head of
monotone is a lot better in this regard (the order of 2-3
minutes for "monotone import" on a 2.6 linux untar). The
basic problem is that in the last release (0.17), a huge
amount of sanity checking code was added to ensure that
inconsistent or generally bad revisions can never be
written/received/transmitted.
The focus is now on speeding that up - there's a _lot_ of
low hanging fruit for us to look at.
