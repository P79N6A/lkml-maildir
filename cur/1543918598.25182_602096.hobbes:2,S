I wouldn't really view this as an adequate changelog.
- The Subject:s are pretty pathetic (please see my suggesed replacements)
- There is no description of the proposed new kernel<->userspace
  interfaces.
  As you are proposing new and permanent enhancements to the Linux API,
  this is something which should be spelled out in some detail.  Because we
  can change the implementation, but we can not ever change your interface.
  It would be nice to get that interface described in Documentation/
  somewhere, but it is *critical* that the design be fully revealed right
  now, during review.
Anyway, I am not a suitable person to review this submission.
I'll put the patches in -mm for a bit of eyeball-and-test (not that anyone
will know how to test it, due to the secret interfaces) but I do not want
to move this code into mainline until someone who is familiar with the PM
code has performed a detailed review of both the implementation and the
design (whatever that is!).
Please send new, complete descriptions of these patches.  I don't think
they can be effectively reviewed without that information.  Except perhaps
by someone who was at the PM summit, but that's cheating.
Thanks.
