Hi
In my workstation when I execute a poweroff command it will shutdown
the system and power off the machine
but when I do it in a rack-mounted server (with the same kernel
"2.4.*") it only will halt the machine ?
Anyone know what is the differrent ? I don't have an issue with that
but I want to learn why is that
