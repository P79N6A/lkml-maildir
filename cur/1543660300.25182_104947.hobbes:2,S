     If the size of the mapped file changes after the call to mmap()
     as a result of some other operation on the mapped file, the
     effect of references to portions of the mapped region that
     correspond to added or removed portions of the file is
     unspecified.

That would make sense.  But we'd have to go and create zillions
of copies of pages inside truncate, and given that the behaviour
is unspecified, it is questionable whether anyone should be
relying on the behaviour anyway..
