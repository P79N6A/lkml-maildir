Um ???  They're both western digital drives, the newer one is UDMA there
other isn't.  What exactly is "backspeeding"?  I remember when I got the 4
GB (UDMA) drive I had to do a BIOS upgrade for it to detect cleanly on
bootup...
Anyway the source of the problem seems to have been poor cooling in the
case (in fact, that would probably explain a _lot_ of sudden
lockup-with-no-sysreq-or-anything I've had) so it's a hardware problem.
False alarm, very sorry people :)
