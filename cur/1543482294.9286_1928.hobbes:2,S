It is really not hard to reserve a certain amount of memory (up to some
fraction, say 25% or 50% of physical memory) for use only by pagable
allocations.  Most desktop boxes will _not_ require more than 50% of
memory for locked kernel pages.  Recovering any given range of
contiguous pages from that pagable region may be expensive but will
_always_ be possible, and given that it will usually be a one-off
expense during driver setup, there is no reason why we cannot support
it.
