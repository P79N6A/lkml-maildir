Okay... I'll ask... what is the point with brk(), i.e. what makes it
faster?  If we didn't have brk(), we could get rid of UNMAPPED_BASE
and therefore get rid of the artificial splitting of userspace memory
(modulo prelink, but that's optional.)
brk() at least on the surface really looks like a strange legacy
interface.  Obviously it's important on nommu architectures, but on
mmu architectures it seems rather redundant.
