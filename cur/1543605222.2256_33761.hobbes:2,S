OK!  This is what I have learned.  The ide-pci init code has one case that
isn't caught.  Perhaps you can clarify what it means, for me.
* If an IDE controller has a PCI IRQ and has class code bit 0x5 set, it is
100% native.
* CSB5 _CAN_NOT_ have a PCI IRQ assigned (RO register).
* CSB5 spec clearly indicates that you can turn on class code bits 0x5 for
native mode operation.
* My system has the native mode bits turned on, but not an IRQ.  The driver
incorrectly drops this case into teh "bad irq" case.
* Solution: cleanup probe to something like:
if ((is_storage_ide || is_storage_other) && native_bits && pciirq) {
        /* 100% native mode */
        init_chipset();
} else if ((is_storage_ide || is_storage_other) && native_bits) {
        /* native mode */
        init_chipset();
} else if (is_storage_ide || is_storage_other) {
        /* non-native mode */
        init_chipset();
} else {
        /* what here ?!?! */
}
or simpler:
if (is_storage_ide || is_storage_other) {
	if (native_bits && pciirq) {
		/* 100% native mode */
	} else if (native_bits) {
		/* plain-old native mode */
	} else {
		/* non-native mode */
	}
	init_chipset();
} else {
	/* what here?!? */
}
What do you think of this case?  The other alternative is to turn OFF
native bits on any CSB5, since it can't have a PCI IRQ assigned.
Please let me know, and I'll work up and test a patch.
