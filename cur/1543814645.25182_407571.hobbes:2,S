I know, but in this case I got this answer: 
" Dear Friend :
  Thank you for contacting ASUS Customer Service.
  My name is ZYC, and I would be assisting you today. 
 sorry ,due to chipset limitation ,
when you add a PCI AUDIO card to a board which use VIA VT8237 southbridge
controller ,
the built in AC97 audio will be disabled automaticly .
it is a chip limitation without way to fix ."
Meantime I tried the patch against the 2.6.13-15 kernel shipped with SuSE 10
(applied without errors), and altough I see 
PCI: enabled onboard AC97/MC97 devices
in the logs, the onboard  card doesn't appear in lspci.
I'm downloading the 2.6.16-rc6 kernel to try with that one. Mine is an
A8V-Deluxe, so I don't know why it didn't work. :-( I have the latest Asus
bios and verified that it is enabled in the BIOS (I know, it doesn't really
matter, but I mention here).
