The CCCR register is by definition a per-CPU entity. However, the perfmon context where the
CCCR is saved is not. Any thread with access to the file descriptor can gain access to the
context. This can occur from any CPU. Of course, we do have checks in place but they
run after the context lock is held. The main restriction is that a thread cannot operate on
a context attached to another thread unless that thread is stopped (checked via ptrace_check_attach).
Yet there are a few perfmon syscalls, for which this restriction does not apply because they
do not need to touch the PMU hardware, yet they modify the context state.
I think this could work on P4, if we could clear the CCCR and yet retain enough state to detect
which counter(s) overflowed. On P6, where there is not overflow bit in the control register, we
simply check the upper bits on the counters. We could probably do the same for P4.
