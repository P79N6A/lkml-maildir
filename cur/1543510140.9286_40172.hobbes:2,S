Greetings, 
I need to create a user mapping to some SDRAM on a PCI board, but I can't 
do it via a regular file operation like mmap() or ioctl().  Instead, the 
mapping should be a side-effect of a device-specific system call I have added.
Further, I want the mapping to have its own vma so I can override the vm_ops
and wire in my SDRAM allocator.
The best way I can see is to dummy up a struct file, wire f_op->mmap to my 
own mmap, pass that to do_mmap(), then override vm_ops in my mmap function.  
Yuck!  But neither remap_page_range() nor anonymous do_mmap() result in a
unique vma whose vm_ops I can override.
What's the right way to do this?  Am I just trying to be too wierd?
Thanks in advance,
Jim
