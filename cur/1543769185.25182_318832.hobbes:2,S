I'm not sure I know of a SCSI drive which does that, either. It was a big
thing a few decades to use rotational energy to park the heads, but I
haven't seen discussion of save to nvram. Then again, I haven't been
looking for it.
What would be ideal is some cache which didn't depend on power to maintain
state, like core (remember core?) or the bubble memory which spent almost
a decade being just slightly too {slow,costly} to replace disk. There
doesn't seem to be a cost effective technology yet.
