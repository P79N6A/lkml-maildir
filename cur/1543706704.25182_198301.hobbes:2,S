Charset of a filename does make sense, though.  That's not per user,
it's per filename.
A name which one user entered as "£10.txt" should ideally display as
that sequence of characters to all users who want to display the name.
I already have this problem on my filesystems: some programs show the
names assuming UTF-8, other programs show them assuming
iso-8859-1.
But it's worse than that.  On my filesystem, names are stored in UTF-8
as is recommended these days.  "ls" on some terminals shows the names
as I wrote them.  But on other terminals it shows the wrong names.
If I create a file using a shell command, what I get depends on which
terminal I used to create it.  If I am using a terminal which displays
UTF-8 but ssh to another machine, the other machine assumes the
terminal is displaying iso-8859-1 even though the other machine's
default locale is UTF-8.  And so on.
