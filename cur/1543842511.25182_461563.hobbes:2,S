What is funny is that mozilla doesn't screw up whitespaces.
2 people checked that patch from the email applies to the kernel.
I even checked the email myself and the only difference between "good"
patches and mine is that mine has "format=flowed" in
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
It looks like some mailers replace TABs with spaces when format=flowed
is specified. So are you sure that the problem is in mozilla?
Thanks,
Kirill
