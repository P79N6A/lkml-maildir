You guys should listen to Ken.  He is a wise man.  Linux is a great little
OS and is probably the world's greatest software development environment.
On the other hand, there are a bunch of places where it leaves a lot
to be desired.  Using an off the shelf Linux for a firewall vs. using
an off the shelf Solaris as a firewall is an interesting comparison.
Using Linux when you really need 64 bits to work is also an interesting
problem.  I've been through 3 startups which are all Linux based and there
was many a time that I was ready to call Sun (I never did, but it was,
and continues to be, quite painful).
There is a huge difference between using Linux as a build machine and
using it to run 100% of your company.  It's getting better every day,
but Ken is absolutely correct in stating that it has a long way to go.
I don't think that any of us would suggest that our banks place their
databases on Linux today (and those of you who would, please suggest it
to *your* bank, not mine).
That doesn't say anything negative about Linux, by the way.  It just
says we still have work to do.  Which is true.
