You mentioned nothing about what sort of performance you were measuring.
Disk, network, memory bandwidth etc.., however at a complete guess you
are hitting this..
mtrr: Serverworks LE detected. Write-combining disabled.
This workaround was for older sewerworks chipsets which were
buggy. Rumour has it that revisions 6 and above are ok.
I have a patch pending for 2.5, if it turns out to be stable,
it should also get merged back to 2.4
