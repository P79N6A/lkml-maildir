Hi,
I dont see any conflicts with ac5, and it still doesnt work... I think
Linus's explanation of the problem is more probable... Also, I have not
been able to reproduce the crash with ACPI recently.. It seems that if I
have ACPI, but no APM, it does freeze... Kernel with APM or with no power
management at all will crash under the same circumstances... But how do I
fix that... I dont know...
show version:
ACPI enabled kernel works fine...
Everything else freezes with yenta...
