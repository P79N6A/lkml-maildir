The guest system /could/ publish all of its RAM, but with 256MB per
board, 19 boards per cPCI crate, that's way too much for a 32-bit PC to
map into it's memory space. That's the real reason I use the 1MB
windows. I could make them bigger (16MB would be fine, I think), but I
doubt it would make much of a difference to the implementation.

I've got a system like that right now in the driver that started this
thread. I tried to mimic the buffer descriptor rings in a network card.
The virtio system doesn't seem to be too different. I can probably work
something out.
What's keeping me from getting started is what to do with the
virtqueue_ops structure once I've got the functions to fill it in. There
isn't a register_virtqueue_ops() function. I'm not at all sure when to
use a struct virtio_driver or a struct virtio_device. I hunch I need one
of these.
If I've understood this whole thing correctly, then I should be able to
register a virtio_ops on both sides, and then insmod virtio_net and
virtio_console, and have them "just work".
I guess what I'm looking for is something trivial, something that'll
insmod and printk() whenever one of the virtqueue_ops pointers is
called. Something like a template. That's how I really learned when all
of the uart functions are called, for example.
Thanks,
