Hmm. In addition, isn't this broken (in that same function):
        memcpy(local_buf, txbuf, n_tx);
        x.tx_buf = local_buf;
        x.rx_buf = local_buf;
        /* do the i/o */
        status = spi_sync(spi, &message);
        if (status == 0)
                memcpy(rxbuf, x.rx_buf + n_tx, n_rx);
shouldn't that 'rx_buf' setup be
	x.rx_buf = local_buf + n_tx;
since the whole point was that we allocated a buffer that can hold _both_ 
the rx and tx parts? Especially as that final copy into the resulting 
"rxbuf" thing uses that "+ n_tx" addition?
