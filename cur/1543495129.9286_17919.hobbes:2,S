Thanks for your quick reply: this was a new idea, I hadn't checked for
any patches before my post. I'll download the patch soon.
Are there any plans to include the patch in the main kernel?

The last time I checked my old Nec P6, it had no keyboard ;->
I'm looking for a _simple_ solution which we could send to a linux
end user who's computer is crashing without an oops report.
No special cables, no second computer, etc.
