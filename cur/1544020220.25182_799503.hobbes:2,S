Heh. We already have that. Maybe you didn't realize. Look at VM_NORESERVE.
So shmem.c can just look at "!(vma->vm_flags & VM_NORESERVE)" if it wants 
to.
The only piece of information you don't have is that "accountable" flag, 
but that was why I was pointing out how totally _useless_ that flag 
actually is. We shouldn't pass it along, because it's always 1, except for 
one special case that we can always calculate (private hugepages).
But in fact, even leaving that untouched, we can trivially just change 
what 'VM_NORESERVE' means: we can just make it the end result of all that 
'accountable' logic, instead of having it just mirror MAP_NORESERVE 
blindly.

How about this pretty trivial patch?
TOTALLY UNTESTED. As usual. But the concept is pretty simple, and it 
actually removes a fair chunk of hacky code.  The only reason the diffstat 
output says that it adds more lines than it deletes is that I added more 
comments and made that helper inline function rather than make a complex 
conditional.
Whaddaya think?
