That's the same patch I just sent out (but you changed comments too), so I 
obviously agree. 
x86 didn't see this (even in 32-bit mode) because it doesn't use that odd 
__SWAB_64_THRU_32__ case, but does the 64-bit swab with native code.
Can you also verify that it works for you (not just compiles), just so 
that I can commit it?
