All of this won't happen when server foo exports /bar and a client
mounts /bar/x and /bar/y separately: there must be a shared subtree or
hard-links between files within them, right?
An obvious (but disruptive) server side workaround is to export the
subtrees with different fsid= but that would give the same list of
problems as above, right?
IMHO I'd only consider returning EBUSY when trying to mount _exactly_
the same directory with different flags, not for arbitrary subtrees. The
client should preferably not be bothered with server side disk
partitioning (at least not beyond the obvious such as df output).
