  * No [for] stupid[s] ML trailes in every sigle e-mail
  * Gmane News server handles crossposting, thus you will not hit same
    message in LKML and linux-ide, for example (How i could forget
    such useful feature? Nice things you are getting used to so fast
    without even noticing it. :) <

  * Spam is not only well-filtered, it is also removed, thus even if
    you see such headers (what is depends on mailing list, gmane
    doesn't remove them) you will not receive the body. After some
    time they are removed completely.

  * While it's service, it's free software available for download, but
    "is next to impossible to set up properly".
