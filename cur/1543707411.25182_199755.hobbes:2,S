 Note that if changing an I/O APIC input was indeed needed, the
replace_pin_at_irq() function could be used.

 I still wonder why these arrangements are made so late in a boot -- after 
all, ACPI IRQ configuration is table-driven and does not require any 
specific hardware initialization to work.  So it could be done at the 
stage MP-table parsing happens, couldn't it?
