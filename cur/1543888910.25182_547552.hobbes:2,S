Hi,
I have following readings:
w83627ehf-isa-0290
Adapter: ISA adapter
VCore:     +1.52 V  (min =  +0.00 V, max =  +1.74 V)
in1:      +12.30 V  (min = +13.46 V, max = +13.04 V) ALARM
AVCC:      +3.36 V  (min =  +4.08 V, max =  +3.95 V) ALARM
3VCC:      +3.36 V  (min =  +4.05 V, max =  +3.06 V) ALARM
in4:       +2.04 V  (min =  +1.78 V, max =  +2.04 V)
in5:       +1.60 V  (min =  +2.04 V, max =  +2.02 V) ALARM
in6:       +5.12 V  (min =  +6.12 V, max =  +6.53 V) ALARM
VSB:       +3.36 V  (min =  +4.08 V, max =  +4.08 V) ALARM
VBAT:      +3.30 V  (min =  +4.08 V, max =  +3.04 V) ALARM
in9:       +1.65 V  (min =  +0.98 V, max =  +2.04 V)
Case Fan:    0 RPM  (min =    0 RPM, div = 8)
CPU Fan:  1638 RPM  (min =    0 RPM, div = 4)
Aux Fan:  1436 RPM  (min = 4272 RPM, div = 4) ALARM
fan5:        0 RPM  (min =    0 RPM, div = 16)
Sys Temp:    +28°C  (high =   -65°C, hyst =   -34°C)   ALARM
CPU Temp:  +34.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, hyst = +75.0°C)
AUX Temp:  +38.5°C  (high = +80.0°C, hyst = +75.0°C)
Fan4 is disabled in the chip. I think the board has 4 connectors. I dont have 
time right now to check the manual.
