Subject: acenic failure with highmem in 2.4.12

Hello,
When I enable the Acenic network driver in combination with high
memory set to 4Gb, the driver fails during boot and prints:
eth0: Firmware NOT running!
This happens with 2.4.12 as well as with 2.4.12-ac3, but 2.4.11 was
working fine even with high memory enabled. With high memory disabled,
the problem disappears and everything works fine.
A diff on acenic.c between 2.4.11 and 2.4.12 reveals that the acenic
driver now does pci_unmap_single() calls which were previously suppressed
by an #ifdef. It thus seems that these are the cause of the problem,
but I don't understand how or why.
Details:
dual Pentium-III with 1 Gb SDRAM.
3Com 3C985 Gigabit Ethernet, Tigon II (Rev. 6), Firmware: 12.4.11
SMP enabled in kernel.
Any ideas ?
Thanks,
  Joris.
