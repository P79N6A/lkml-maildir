Hi Con!
Maybe reports about scheduler tests and feedback should by default go to this 
mailing list *and* the kernel mailinglist.
I bet that Linus doesn't read this list and thus misses most of the favorable 
reports for SD.
I am using 2.6.21-ck2 everywhere now and I am really happy.
I did not test recent CFS, but Ingo asked me do to it with my Amarok machine, 
to test for regressions since introduction of increased 3D performance. In my 
last tests SD and CFS behaved quite equivalent to one another - that was with 
CFS-v11. If CFS-v14 has not regressed, it would work for me as well.
But I also appreciate the other enhancements in ck patchset and I would like 
to have as much as possible of it into mainline.
Actually I think the decision on which scheduler to put into mainline should 
depend on its technical merits and the user feedback.
Regards,
