It's not so much gymnastics -- implementing different handling for cpufreq
drivers which do not affect the TSC is easy. It's just difficult to get to
know what drivers/CPUs are affected... and the test run you did yesterday
helped in evaluating this. Thanks for doing so.

Normally, when using cpufreq drivers the original state is known -- only the
ACPI spec has this severe flaw, but there are tries for a workaround [patch
is submitted]

IIRC, John Stultz intends to do a major upgrade of the timing code in 2.7.
