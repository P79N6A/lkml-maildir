It has to keep track of what DMA channel to use, which it gets when
the channel ADDED callback happens. So it's basically
if (some_client_struct->dma_chan)
    dma_memcpy()
else
    memcpy()
The async memcpy has the added requirement that at some point the
client must verify the copies have been completed, so doing async
memcopies does require more work on the client's part.

Haven't given any thought to priorities yet -- we've been focusing on
getting the 1 client case to perform well. :)
Chris posted a link to this: git://198.78.49.142/~cleech/linux-2.6
branch ioat-2.6.17
So you can post patches against that, or the patches posted here apply
against davem's git tree.
