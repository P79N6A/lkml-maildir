Ok.  Overall this feels good but a few nits below.
Would it make sense to split this into two patches.
The first to just do the cleanup that removes the allocations
for holding the mttr ranges?

Could we name it MAX_VAR_RANGES and not NUM_VAR_RANGES.
In practices this is going to be 8 for every cpu I know of,
so calling this NUM_VAR_RANGES may be a little confusing.

I think that should be:

Or even better yet the declaration moved to a header file.

This looks like it will handle the common case, so I have no major objections
to this code.
At least in theory and possibly in practice there are a couple of corner
cases we have missed her.
- Overlapping MTRRs.
- What happens if we have uncached memory lower down?
  Except for performance problems I guess that case is relatively harmless.
- Is it possible and worth it to amend the e820 map, so it shows the
  problem area as Reserved or otherwise not usable RAM?
