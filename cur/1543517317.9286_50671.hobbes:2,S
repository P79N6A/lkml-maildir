I have done it, but nsmod atyfb.o vc:0-0 don't work: insmod takes all CPU times
and don't give me the hand back... and lsmod don't show that module... so I tried
modprobe and the module got loaded, the other screen wake up, but the system crash...
So I could not give you any debug info... Is there another way?

I don't understand the modedb.txt: I have tried to put one append="video=1024x768-16@85"
in lilo.conf, but that doesn't work... How should I tell lilo that aty128fb should be
1600x1200-16@75 and that atyfb (if it would works once...) at 1280x1024-16@75?
Many thanks,
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
