Very odd.  I cannot reproduce this, but then my drives are somewhat
smaller than yours (though I'm not sure how that could be
significant).
Can you try a raid0 across 2 drives?  That would be more like the
raid5 layout than raid1.
My guess is some subtle hardware problem,  as I would be very
surprised in the raid5 code is causing this.  Maybe run memtest86?
