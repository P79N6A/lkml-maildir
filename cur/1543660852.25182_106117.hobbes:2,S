I agree with you that it's not the kernels main task to draw logos, though
it might be a little late to handle it in init. 2.4 kernels take quite
some time before entering init. True, 2.5 kernels are a lot faster
already, but, take an embedded device: all drivers might be built into the
kernel, and when the kernel is entering init, most stuff is done already.
Besides: There is no need for a user to see that the kernel detected the
CPU again. Maybe the kernel messages should automagically show up in case
of errors, and flip away the logo. Of course this implies the logo is
handled completely by the kernel.
I think you are mostly done by tweaking some fbcon code, it has
implemented some logo code already.
