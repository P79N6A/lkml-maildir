Hi all,
I've been following the evolution of kobject events patch. This is 
because I'd like to implement a netfilter target that is able to send an 
event to userland using it.
There's a small description of it and some background in the netfilter 
mailing list:
http://lists.netfilter.org/pipermail/netfilter-devel/2004-August/016342.html
Now that the events are strictly associated with kobjects (the original 
patch had a way to send arbitrary events) I have two choices:
1) Send the events so that they are always associated with the network 
devices class_device kobject. I guess this would be quite clean way to 
do it, but it'd require adding a new signal type and would limit the 
iptables target to be associated always with a interface.
2) Create a device class that has virtual timer devices that trigger 
events (ie. /sys/class/utimer). Each timer could have some attributes 
(like expired, expire_time, etc.) and would emit "change" signals 
whenever timer expires.
I'd like to hear what you think of the thing I'm trying to do?
And especially how "bad" idea the option 2 is (since the new class might 
not be useful for others)?
Any ideas how this could be done better?
