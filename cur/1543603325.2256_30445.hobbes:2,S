Folks, there's a problem aside of set_blocksize().  You are doing memset
and memcpy on unlocked buffer returned by getblk().  That's a race -
if that buffer is currently being read into, we will get a random crap.
And write it to disk afterwards.
General rule: don't modify buffer you've got from getblk() unless you've
locked it and mark it uptodate before you unlock.  We had the same
bug in ext2, BTW.
