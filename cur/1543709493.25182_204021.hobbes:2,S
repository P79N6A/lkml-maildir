Sure. One place, yes. But separate header sets are IMHO too much crazy.

Is it the kernel which is based on glibc, or is it glibc (and the rest of
the userland as glibc isn't that special) using the kernel interface?
The kernel doesn't need glibc at all, I don't know why do you want it
to require some external headers to compile.
Should the kernel behave differently when compiled with different glibc
header sets? :-)
IMHO all the defines should be in the kernel tree. Glibc can and should
use them, as it uses the ABI.

Don't think so. Anyway, there is no other acceptable option. The kernel
must compile without glibc headers (without any external headers, to
be precise) - as it doesn't need any external software to work.
The open question (of much less importance) is if we want to keep
the existing include/ layout or to move public parts to include/linux-abi
etc. It still has to reside in the kernel tree, though. I'd go with the
former for now as it requires less work. OTOH the latter might be
cleaner.

Examples?
If they are part of kernel API/ABI, then of course they are still used
by 2.6 kernel and they need to be there. If they aren't used by the
kernel (old #define names for instance) they should go to glibc headers
(#ifndef xxx #define xxx etc.).
