A quick google brings up this reference:
http://www.iglu.org.il/lxr/source/arch/x86_64/kernel/bluesmoke.c
The error appears to be generated by the code starting around line 152
in that file.
Btw, what is 'bluesmoke'?

Certainly I had a lot of trouble with this card, I was pleased the
aacraid driver worked enough to let me even install this time - the Red
Hat GinGin64 installer gave a kernel panic - so I wouldn't be surprised
if this card/driver were the cause. :(

What will I lose by disabling this?
I just tried booting with mce=0 and I am still getting the same errors.

I will give that a go and see what happens.
Thanks for the response Andi.
