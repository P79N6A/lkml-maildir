Hmm, can you include the same change for compat_sys_select()?
When that was introduced, sys_select and compat_sys_select were
basically identical in their code, which makes it a lot easier
to verify that the compat_ version is correct.
Interestingly, doing a diff between sys_select and compat_sys_select
in the current kernel seems to suggest that they are both buggy
in that they miss checks for failing __put_user, but in /different/
places.
