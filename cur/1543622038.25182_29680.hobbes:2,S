This is a question moreso for alan cox i guess. I was just wondering
about the change in the last -ac to combine the 2.4.18-rc2 patch with
the -ac2 as one patch. I was just wondering will this be a permanent
change? Also I was wondering why there is no changelog for the -ac
patches like for the other trees.
