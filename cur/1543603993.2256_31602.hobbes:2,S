Rik,
It work well when I pressure it under some intensive IO operations under
dpkg and made progress when previous VMs basically froze. I did have two
running programs that have large working sets which created a lot of
contention and some CPU choppiness, but possibly some per process thrash
control should allow for both to make progress. ;-)
Good work.
