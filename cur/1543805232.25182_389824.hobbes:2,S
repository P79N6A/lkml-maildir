Yes, true. Thanks for pointing this out.
Now I am thinking about s_umount semaphore that you mentioned yesterday.
I thought we could always do a down_read_trylock on it under the 
dcache lock.
Here is one more attempt at fixing the race :-)
Assumptions: 
1. Super block s is still valid after prune_one_dentry (found this to be true).
   This is required to do the up_read().
Costs:
1. Holding s_umount for each dentry
Comments?
Thanks,
Balbir
