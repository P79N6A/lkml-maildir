Bit 20 in edx is set if NX is available for C7:
eax in: 0x80000001, eax = 00000000 ebx = 00000000 ecx = 00000000 edx = 00100000
( from your posting "This kernel requires the following..." )
The official VIA Eden  datasheet seems to be NDA. I have not found any
official download link on the pages:
http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/processors/c7/
The /c3/ pages contain the documentation  for the C3 family.
I do not think the NX feature can be switched on/off by regular registers.
May be it helps to play around with the bios ?
Load "default settings" => see how the NX flag acts.
Load "optimized settings" => see how the NX flags acts.
I suppose the bios developer had used one setting to test and
work with the NX flag regular.

PS: @Simon, sorry that I missed the other thread. Too much traffic
and not enough time for me to read all. I suppose that's a fulltime job ;-)
