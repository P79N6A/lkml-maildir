Fwiw, -X34 does not fix the lockups for everyone else.

The board is not in the same country as me (Wales vs. France), but I
visit it every few months so there is some chance of me testing it on
that timescale.  AFAIK there are no computer experts in the area to
enable remote access ;-)

It does not look hopeful.  Let us look at an old email:

It has "Bus Master DMA" option, but no "UDMA" option.  It's an FIC
PC-2011, manufactured about August 1997.  I always assumed the hardware
did UDMA (that's one reason I bought it).

Will do, at my next recompile.  Would that be with the patch you sent me?

Is this strictly true?  You've obviously got all the chipset docs, and I
doubt anything on the motherboard interferes with IDE timings/state
machines.

I know, I did hdparm -X34 explicitly to avoid lockups.

And with these settings unchanged, the system locks up from time to
time.
