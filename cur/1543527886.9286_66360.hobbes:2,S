According to the old law of the land, and then enshrined in common law,
if an apple tree has a branch overhanging the road, passerby commit no
crime by plucking an apple from it to assuage their hunger.
In fact, passerby are welcome to satisfy their hunger from bushes off
the side of the road, as long as they only satisfied their hunger and
didn't carry anything off with them.  This didn't confer on them the
right to set up camp, but seems comparable to me of the use many people
make of network scans.
Its only neighborly to share some resources.  I practice what I preach.
