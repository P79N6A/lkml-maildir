Andi,
 Sometime in the last week something was introduced to Linus'
tree which makes my dual EM64T go nuts when X tries to start.
By "go nuts", I mean it does various random things, seen so
far..
- Machine check. (I'm convinced this isn't a hardware problem
  despite the new addition telling me otherwise :)
- Reboot
- Total lockup
- NMI watchdog firing, and then lockup
I've tried backing out a handful of the x86-64 patches, and
didn't get too far, as some of them are dependant on others,
it quickly became a real mess to try to bisect where exactly it broke.
Any ideas for potential candidates to try & back out ?
