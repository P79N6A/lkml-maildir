seems to be the same thing - an unbalanced preemption count, possibly
due to some locking error. Unfortunately the assert catches the
imbalance only at exit time. (it's unlikely that the do_exit() code is
buggy.)
i'll add a new feature to debug this: when crashing on an assert and
tracing is enabled the trace leading up to the crash will be printed to
the console. How did you capture the crash - was it in the syslog or do
you have serial logging? Maybe this is not the real crash but only a
followup crash?
