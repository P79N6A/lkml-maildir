Humm; I am also seeing eratic behaviour on the 2.4.12+ series using
eepro100. have you changed out the central point hub or switch? I did this
with a x-ovr and saw performance that should be expected under SuSE 2.4 16,
but still see issues under load with more than one target. Seems there are
differences for me under SuSE than RH, meaning the driver s compiled with
flags under SuSE or something that kills performance.
Regards,
Jon
