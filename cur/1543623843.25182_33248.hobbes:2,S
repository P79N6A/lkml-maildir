Thanks for the replies.
The entire purpose of this machine is to run big honking Lisp jobs (which,
BTW, it does very well).  I need as much user address space as I can get.
So `CONFIG_3GB' and `CONFIG_2GB' are out of the question.  I might be able
to live with `CONFIG_1GB', but I can also live with the problem.
Also, given that the machine is in service, I hesitate to try prereleased
kernels.  If it's thought that 2.4.19 will fix or ameliorate the problem,
I'd rather just wait for that.
But if the problem is not a known one, I am happy to do whatever I can do to
help diagnose it, as long as I can do that without more than an occasional
reboot.  For instance, is there some way to get a statistical profile of
where the kernel is spending its time?  Even something very rough like a
handful of samples of the PC might be revealing -- particularly if, as I
suspect, the CPUs are stuck in spinlocks a lot of the time.
BTW, this doesn't seem like a preemption issue, considering that throughput
is very definitely affected as well as latency.
Anyway, please let me know if there's anything I can do, within my
constraints, to help.  (As you can guess, though, I don't have any kernel
debugging experience.)
Please CC: replies to me, as I am not on the list.
