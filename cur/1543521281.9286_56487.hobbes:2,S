All,
I've been trying to install the bigphysarea stuff in
the 2.3.36 kernel.  However, the memory management
has changed somewhat and memory_{start,end} no longer
exist.  What's the new strategy for getting n contigous
pages at boot time (and a pointer to the start in the
kernels address space) ?
TIA,
-- 
  Fred.
