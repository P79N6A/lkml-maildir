Subject: Reasonable to add a warning for compilation with non-GCC?

Apologies if this subject has been brought up before.
It seems to me that it would be reasonable to have a warning printed via
#pragma if the compiler name/version the user is using is not one of the
known-good versions.  This should under no circumstances be a fatal error,
since the user should be free to try it anyway, but I think the warning
should be highly visible, so someone receiving a fatal compiler error, for
instance, will already have been informed that their compiler probably
won't work, and that they should use GCC 2.7.2.x.
Just an uninformed opinion.
