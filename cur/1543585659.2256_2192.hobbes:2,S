Thanks to all for their advice on this problem.  So far I've tried
hdparm flags six ways from sunday to no effect, but I have yet to
try suggestions such as those below.  Alas I have to set aside this
problem for the next few weeks.
In the mean time, I note that the linux machines at my Lab are being
subjected to fairly severe security attacks at the moment (the latest
involved a hold in the bind DNS server (?) ) - a reminder
to all to keep applying those updates and security patches.
