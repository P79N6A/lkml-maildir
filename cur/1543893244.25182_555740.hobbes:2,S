Great! Finally CFS is included ;)
Right now I'm using a patched kernel (2.6.21.4) with realtime-preemption patch 
and it works fine but I noticed something that I think you should know.
There's a problem with mac80211. I'm using "mac80211-8.0.1" 
and "iwlwifi-0.0.25" driver with my "Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG" card.
When loading the "iwl3945" module or when an application (like wpa_supplicant, 
dhcpcd...) tries to do something with the card, I get this message in dmesg:
BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code:

Anyway, the wifi card works fine.
I got rid of this message by commenting the code of the 
function "ieee80211_set_multicast_list()" that's 
on "net/mac80211/ieee80211.c" but this isn't a proper fix.
I think you should know about this because kernel 2.6.22 already includes 
mac80211.
Greetings.
