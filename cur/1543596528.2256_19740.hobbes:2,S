2.4.x and XFree86 4.1.0 is first combination that doesn't mess up my text
console and crash if there are graphics updates in X when console is in text
mode. XF 3.3.6 was just deadlocking my machine (I used Accelerated-X before
XFree86 4.x). I haven't tested the framebuffer in this machine.
GDA is Voodoo3 2000 PCI (SDRAM).
