This was my end result (or some sort of proper finer-grained lock) but I
was unsure of how to deal with the other llseek methods that may be
oddball.  I have no reason to suspect using the inode semaphore won't
work.
Another gain from pushing the locks into each method is that we can pick
and choose as-needed.  If it turns out inode semaphore is a global
solution, the following patch is sufficient.  Otherwise, we could
replace the lock_kernel in each caller with the inode semaphore, as
appropriate.  Oh Al ??
