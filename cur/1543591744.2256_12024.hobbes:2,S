To throw away dirty and dead swapcache (its done at swap writepage())
pages page_launder() has to run into its second loop (launder_loop = 1)
(meaning that a lot of clean cache has been thrown out already).
We can "short circuit" this dead swapcache pages by cleaning them in the
first page_launder() loop.
Take a look at the writepage() patch I sent to Linus a few days ago.
