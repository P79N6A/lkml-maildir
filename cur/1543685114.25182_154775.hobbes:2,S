On reflection, it could probably work in 2.4 and current nfs-utils,
but admin might be a bit clumsy.
To allow knfsd to see a mountpoint, you have to export the mounted
directory with the "nohide" option.  Currently "nohide" only works
properly for exports to specific hosts, not to wildcarded hosts or
netgroups.
So if your /etc/export contains:
  /path/to/some/--bind/mountpoint servername(nohide,....)
for every mountpoint and every server, then it should work.
In 2.6, you can (will be able to) just export the top level mount
point with "crossmnt" and it should all work for you.
Getting that functionality into 2.4 would be a very big job.
