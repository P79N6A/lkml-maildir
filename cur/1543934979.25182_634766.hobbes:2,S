I'm afraid this can't be put into practice.  (User says which hardware
and protocols he needs to be supported, scripts magically assemble a
suitable configuration.)
I think
  - sensibly modularize our software,
  - tell the user which software components there are,
  - what they are for,
  - how they depend on each other,
  - make it easy enough for the user to navigate in the dependency
    graph,
  - provide fundamental safeguards and checks for a proper software
    configuration
is the best we can do.
