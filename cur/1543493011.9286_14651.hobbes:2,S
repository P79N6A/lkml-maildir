But what of AFS (or, if you prefer, Arla)?  It has even less support for Unix 
file metadata... but it *does* have security, both for authentication and
data (at least in theory for data, by setting the Rx RPC layer to do encrypted
transfers).  It is reasonable to expect binaries from an AFS directory that
only allows administrators write access to be secure... but the metadata is
worthless for identifying such.  (Even the setuid bit has only spotty support.)

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
