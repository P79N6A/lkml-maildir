Well, for an MSDOS partition table, you would look for '253', for a  
Mac partition table you could look for something like 'Linux_RAID' or  
similar (just arbitrarily define some name beginning with the Linux_  
prefix), etc.  This means that the partition table type would need to  
be exposed as well (I don't know if it is already).
