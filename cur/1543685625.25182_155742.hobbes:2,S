Fun.
Have you read the excellent DRAM series on ars technica?

Sounds like you're thwacking into memory latency and bank switching and such.  
(Yes, you can thrash dram.  It's not as noticeable as with disk, but it's can 
be done.)
The memory bus speed will affect this a little bit, but it's not going to do 
to much for request turnaround time except make it proportionally even worse.  
Same for DDR. :)
