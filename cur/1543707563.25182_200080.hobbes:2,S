Greetings,
                                                                                                                             I was searching the source and changelogs of 2.6.3 to find the specific
patch that fixed the recent security hole discovered in mremap()
http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0014-mremap-unmap.txt
                                                                                                                             I found Andrew Morton's changelog entry that touched mremap:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1557.2.83?nav=index.html
|ChangeSet@-2d
                                                                                                                             I noticed however, that a fix to the same problem in 2.4.25 sent by
Andrea Arcangeli adds only one line to a different section of code:
 
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.4/diffs/mm/mremap.c@1.7?nav=cset@1.1136.94.4
                                                                                                                             Is this line missing from 2.6.3, or did Andrew Morton's fixes address
the problem already?
