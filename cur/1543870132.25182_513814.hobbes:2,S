I have the same problem, though it appears randomly. It seems like the 
chances for this happening are bigger if I do heavy disk I/O. The only 
way to fix that is to shut down the computer and wait a few seconds 
before rebooting (if I don't wait, the problem doesn't go away). I 
bought new harddrives, so it's most likely not caused by the drives, I 
also tried putting the drives onto a different controller (I have four 
on-board SATA controller and two harddrives), that didn't help either, 
so I suspect its the cable - SATA cables are very error-prone, I don't 
trust them as they don't hold that tightly in the socket.
