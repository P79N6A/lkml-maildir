Running with nmi_watchdog=2 has made the problem a bit harder to
reproduce[1], but when it does hang it doesn't produce a trace (I left it
for several minutes just in case..).  Checking /proc/interrupts after 
boot shows around 16 NMIs, which I presume means that it's being used? -
although it didn't seem to be going up at anything like once every 5
seconds.
Is it possible that I'm not seeing the trace because I'm using a VGA
virtual console rather than a real serial console?

[1] actually, on second thoughts I think this is due to the fact that
when I was previously producing the problem, there was an md resync
operation happening (from a previous crash :).  After leaving it over
the weekend the disks were idle - I couldn't get the problem back until
I attempted a backup of a particular file which seems to frequently
cause this problem.
