Was the lid open, so the cat pressed some keys that messed things up,
or was did it overheat from fans being covered by cat?
What model is the laptop?  My brother has a Fujitsu-Siemens where the
keyboard locks up if you plug a wheel mouse into the PS/2 port and
move the mouse at the same time you touch the touchpad.  He doesn't
have a cat.
