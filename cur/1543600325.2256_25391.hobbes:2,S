Hi,
I should have paid more attention to this error message:
>         scsi : aborting command due to timeout pid 0, scsi 1, channel 0, id 0,
> lun 0 Read (10) 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00

I disabled dma with hdparm, now the RICOH works like a charm.
As for the oops ... if there's anything I can try out, let me now.
Viktor
