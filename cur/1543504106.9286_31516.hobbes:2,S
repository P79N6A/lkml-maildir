correct. (except that docs i have suggest this was introduced in the ppro)

hmm, interesting thoughts. I can't at the moment think of a way to 
time the difference; i strongly suspect that the old way was not
better - mispredicted branches caused by an out of sync rsb would
probably outweight any benefits that one removed unconditional jump
could give. These funtions _can_ return without scheduling.
