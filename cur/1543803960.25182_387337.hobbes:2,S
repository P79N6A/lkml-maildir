I understood you to be saying that a raid-5 was less reliable than a 
single disk, which it is not.  Maybe I did not read correctly.  Yes, a 3 
+ n disk raid-5 has a higher chance of failure than a 3 disk raid-5, but 
only slightly so, and in any case, a 3 disk raid-5 is FAR more reliable 
than a single drive, and only slightly less reliable than a two disk 
raid-1 ( though you get 3x the space for only 50% higher cost, so 6x 
cheaper cost per byte of storage ).
