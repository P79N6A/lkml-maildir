Thanks.

Good - my usual benchmark for documentation is that at least one place
in the code or associated documentation clearly describes things.
My main concern in this patch was that there were zero instances of
documentation of this new /proc file.  The patch should include a text
explanation of this feature, and put it somewhere.
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt looked like a reasonable place, but
I don't really care where, nor do I lose as much sleep as I should when
some documentation is incomplete or stale.  Just so long as everything
is clearly explained somewhere.
