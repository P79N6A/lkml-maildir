Hi,
on an iBook, currently running 2.4.22-benh2, the dmasound_pmac does
not restore the mixer setting during PowerManagement resume. I need to
use e.g. umix or whatever to reset it - but a simple change on a mixer
value is enought to set a useful value.
The device in use:
Found KeyWest i2c on "uni-n", 2 channels, stepping: 4 bits
i2c-core.o: adapter mac-io 0 registered as adapter 2.
Found KeyWest i2c on "mac-io", 1 channel, stepping: 4 bits
tas driver [TAS3004 driver V 0.3])
using i2c address: 0x35 from device-tree
i2c-core.o: driver TAS3004 driver V 0.3 registered.
i2c-core.o: client [tas Digital Equalizer] registered to adapter [mac-io 0](pos. 0).
Audio jack plugged, muting speakers.
AE-Init snapper mixer
PowerMac Snapper  DMA sound driver rev 016 installed
Core driver edition 01.06 : PowerMac Built-in Sound driver edition 00.07
Write will use    4 fragments of   32768 bytes as default
The code in tas3004_leave_sleep() looks ok so ... any idea (maybe I
need to add a printk do test if it is really called?)?
Sincerely yours,
  René Rebe
