a)
vmware for linux needs a linux kernel to work. does that meen
you whant to gpl it? 
b)
you can write abstraction modules for different os's. and the 
non-gpl module works with all of them. so my module does not
need the linux abstraction module it also works with the free-
BSD module. the only #ifdef in my module will be around the 
module registration code. or i write a propriatary loader,
so that even the same binary works for different os's
