You know, if you wanted to get really really gross and disgusting about this, 
you could always have write(fd, NULL, count) punch a hole in the file.  (Then 
have libc's write() check for NULL and error out, and have a seprate punch() 
call that does the write with the null...)
Just one way to avoid introducing a new syscall...
