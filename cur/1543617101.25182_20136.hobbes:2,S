It's not nearly that easy.  If it were, we would all certainly switch to
the preemptive kernel design, and preempt whenever and wherever we
needed.
Instead, we have to worry about reentrancy and thus can not preempt
inside critical regions (denoted by spinlocks).  So we can't have
preempt there, and have more work to do -- thus this discussion.
