That works (on my system), but I don't think it should.  /bin/dmesg is 755 and 
syslog(3, ...) is allowed for normal users, which allows them to see stuff 
that maybe they shouldn't.
If this really is a bug, then it would be useful for normal users to see what 
the kernel has to say about their processes.
