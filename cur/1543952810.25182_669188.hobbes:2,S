!!!!! Yes you are right.
No, we don't need to change detach_pid(), but we can change transfer_pid()
and kill this line:
	old->pids[type].pid = NULL;
this can't break de_thread()->release_task(leader)->__unhash_process()
because leader is not group_leader() any longer.
And with this change we can't see task_session() == NULL under rcu_read_lock()
during exec, great!
And. this doesn't break do_each_pid_task(PIDTYPE_SID), we can't see both
old and new leaders.

Yes, good point. Except we need a couple of subtle but straightforward
changes, but I think this change worth it.
Perhaps I (or you ;) missed something, I'll re-check... but this all
looks like a good plan, thanks!
Oleg.
