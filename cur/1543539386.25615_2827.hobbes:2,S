In the tree? Then it's done. Otherwise put lock_kernel() upon the entry to
your ->release() and unlock_kernel() before each return from said
functions.

Which I did. But I _can't_ do it for 3rd-party code. If you know how one
could locate all boxen belonging to developers of such code, break into
each one, find their patches and do updates - pray tell, it should be
interesting. In-tree code _had_ _been_ _updated_. If you can show a
single time when I had submitted "oh, let's break everything and let
maintainers fix it" kind of patch - you are welcome, name the version when
it had happened and accept my deep apologies.
