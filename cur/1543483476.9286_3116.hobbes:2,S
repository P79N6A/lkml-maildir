Not my specific problem, but it crashed on a friend's machine and screwed up
his vfat partition so bad that booting off a 95 boot disk doesn't show a
drive c:
What happened was he was unacing (It's like unzipping actually) some files
from an nfs server to the machine that crashed.  As I understood it, there
were lots of network activity.  I don't know how long or anything like that
as the guy was almost too pissed to  give me more than what I put here.
As I said, the system was running 2.2.0-pre6.  The source files were over
NFS and going to a vfat paritition.  The HDD controller is a DTC using the
ncr53c8xx scsi driver.  The Nic is a generic NE2K.
I can't give anymore info than this...  I really don't want a responce
unless the problem has been pinpointed.  More likely, there won't be a
reproduction of this problem. (I don't use 95 here so I can't try this)
