On systems where one keyboard is shared between two or more
computers, when you switch the mechanical switch from one machine
to the next, the keyboard repeat rate gets reset to slowness.
I'd like the keyboard to maintain my repeat rate across this if
possible.  I'd like it to be seamless - so no user needs to do
anything.  Thus I figured the best way would be to have the
keyboard handler detect the keyboard disappearing and reappearing
and reprogram the repeat rate.  Another option would be to
reprogram the repeat rate upon VC switch.
Any other ideas?  Sample code?  I'd really appreciate it,
thanks..

I've overclocked my keyboard interface.  It's quite messy dipping my
hands into the mineral oil, but *MAN* is my keyboard ever fast now!
