Well, thanks for the reply and I'm going forward for now, but the Makefile
is actually calling this 2.6.25-rc8. My next "git bisect good" after the
above landed me now after 2.6.25 according to the Makefile. It could just
be a tags issue I guess, where my tree is confused about what tag belongs
to v2.6.25?
(new two lines in the log)
# good: [ba380013b681e91e059f95b51002f8d43024b371] b43: Add fastpath to b43_mac_suspend()
