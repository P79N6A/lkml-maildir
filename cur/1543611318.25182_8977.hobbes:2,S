Ok.  I could see this being a bad thing.
I could also see the easiest thing to implement would be updating the super
block on mount.
However, is this a case where Linux tries not to update the superblock
about being dirty until something has actually changed (ie, be slightly
smarter), and that's not working, or is the superblock simply not being
updated on mount?
Thanks,
