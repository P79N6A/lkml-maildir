Now I've upgraded to the latest tulip.c driver (0.91), and we'll see if
this works out.
I will state my case at the tulip mailinglist if there are more
problems.
Thanks (Allan, Mathew etc) for a speedy reply, this knocked the socks of
my boss who thinks a no-op reply from Microsoft after a month is a
normal thing and growls about unsupported linux :-)
