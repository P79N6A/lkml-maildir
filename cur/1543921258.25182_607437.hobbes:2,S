Jeff - 
You are correct, it is eth1 - which is the only hardware interface I
have available on the system.  It is implemented on the motherboard
using the Nvidia CK804 chip set.  My motherboard is an MSI product.
Attached at the end of this is an extract from an lshal command which I
hope will provide what you are looking for.
Bisect - I am willing to give it a try, but I see two problems.  
First, git12 was a dead dog on my system.  so what ever happened there
is not much of a spread between there and git14 which is where I am
having this problem.
BUT, I am willing to try if you are willing to do a little hand holding.
I have git 1.5.2.5 on my system.
I have NO git repository on my system no am I sure how to get it.  To
date the method I have been using is to download the newest patches on a
on a daily basis and work from there.
So, yes, I am willing to bisect, as long as you understand you may get a
few private, off-the-list emails asking for guidance.
