I seem to have experienced a similar problem, but I didn't have to
stress the system at all.
I upgraded to 2.2.2 from 2.0.36 because I needed 2048 bytes/sector
support for my new Fujitsu 1.3 GB MO drive.
The system is based on RedHat 5.1 + everything in mentioned in
Documentation/Changes except for procps (still at 1.2.7) and chsh).  I 
will upgrade these tonight.
I've got a 300 MHz Intel PII, 256 MB RAM, UP (not SMP), and the
Adaptec 294x UW SCSI controller.
Problem 1:
When I tried to mke2fs on a 1.3GB MO drive, it wrote out only about 16 
out of 760+ inode tables when the process seemed to get stuck.  The
first time it seemed to stick at 3, then jumped to 5.  I was able to
kill the task, but it took 10-15 seconds before it actually
terminated.  When I retried, it got a little further, but never beyond 
about 16 inode tables.
Problem 2:
I dialed up my ISP, and tried to telnet to a couple of different
hosts, but after the initial connection was made, no data seemed to be 
exchanged (per tcpdump).
Sorry for the lack of hard data to support these problem reports.  I
will try to collect it, but in the mean time, I wan't to see if other
people have been experiencing similar problems with 2.2.2.
regards,
Drago
