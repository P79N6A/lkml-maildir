Well, downloaded 2.5.13 last night.  Executive summary: 2.5.13 IS
buggy.
Explanation: some code now differs in the code path concerned, and
ide_register_subdriver now only calls ide_dma_check for UDMA drives
(previously all DMA drives), but ultimately ide_dma_check still ends up
in ide_config_drive_speed, and that's still fuctionally the same as
2.4.
My patch doesn't apply though, due to slight changes to types and
macros, but it's not exactly a hard patch to port.  Moreover, it's
probably better to fix the problem more directly than to port my patch
;-))
Neil
