I agree. I stated it in the terms I did because Alexandre originally 
brought "ethics and morality" into the discussion. Not that my word choice is 
wrong at all - violating a copyright license is, after all, illegal.

I agree that it is "bad for the community". The impression I've gotten from 
reading the GPLv3, reading transcripts of interviews with RMS, reading 
transcripts of interview with Eben Moglen *and* from the FSFLA members 
participating in this discussion the reason for the anti-tivoization language 
in GPLv3 isn't "its bad for the community" but "we find it ethically and 
morally wrong". That being the reason, what they are saying with the language 
in the GPLv3 is "this is bad/evil and things that are bad/evil should be 
illegal".

It is. Consumed a solid six-hour stretch of my day (5PM EDT to 11PM EDT, June 
14, 2007) (FYI: EDT is UTC - 4)
