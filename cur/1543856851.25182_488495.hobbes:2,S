We always run reclaim against the whole zone not against parts. Why 
would we start running reclaim against a portion of a zone?

Mel's patches are already managing "sections" (if you want to call it 
that) of a zone in units of MAX_ORDER. If we memorize where the lowest 
unmovable MAX_ORDER block is then we have the necessary separation and can 
do memory unplug on the remainder of the zone.

There are multiple issues that we discuss here. Please be clear. 
Categorical demands for perfection certainly wont help us.
