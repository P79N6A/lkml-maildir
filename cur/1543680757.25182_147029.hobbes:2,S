My first guess is that blk_oversized_queue is false but there aren't any
requests left.  That will pretty much spin in __get_request_wait with
irqs off, which sounds similar to what he's hitting.
I think we need this hunk even if it doesn't fix his problem.
Stephan, if this patch doesn't help, could you please boot with
nmi_watchdog=1?  An earlier email said sysrq wasn't working, so we'll
probably need the nmi_watchdog to get a backtrace.
