Okay, guess I misunderstood what you wrote before.
The patch below for 2.6.23 should do what you want (and more besides).  
It forces the USB Persist feature to apply to all persist-enabled 
devices, whether they were unplugged or not.
There's no chance of this getting accepted into the official kernel in 
such a simple form, but at least it will allow you to do what you want.
