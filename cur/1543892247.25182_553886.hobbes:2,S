I estimate something on the order 5-10 million Linux phones use
something similar to these patches.  I wonder if there are that many
provable users of of the simple cramfs.  This is where the community
has taken cramfs.
Nevertheless, I understand your point.  I wrote AXFS in part because
the hacks required to do XIP on cramfs where ugly, hacky, and complex.
 Please review the latest patch in the thread, it's just a draft but
the changes required are not very complex now, especially in light of
the filemap_xip.c APIs being used.  It just happens not to work, yet.

What??  You mean like use xip_file_mmap() and implement
get_xip_page()?  Did you read my latest patch?
