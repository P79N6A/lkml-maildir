I agree with these problems, but I think the proper fix is complicated.  AFAICT, 
POSIX capability evolution, as specified by whatever draft it was, is broken, so 
the hacks in prepare_binprm (cap_bprm_set_security in 2.6) are needed to avoid 
security problems.  Aside from the fact that non-inheritable-by-default makes 
little sense (and requires root to get capabilities re-added from the file 
_permitted_ set), POSIX cap evolution has some other problems:
1. Can a process have capabilities in its inheritable set and not in its 
permitted set?  POSIX allows such processes to be created (pI = pP = full, then 
execute (fI = 0, fP = 0).  Nevertheless, its pP evolution rule assumes that this 
never happens (pI capabilities can reappear).
2. If a process has pE < pP (i.e. some caps disabled, e.g. uid=0, euid!=0), and 
exec's fE=full, then its capabilities get re-enabled.  This seems like a pretty 
serious breakage of userspace.
I have a possible fix to these issues at 
<

 -- CONFIG_FS_CAPS (in 
cap-1-fscap.patch) changes the capability evolution rules slightly to make them 
(IMHO) both safe and sensible, as well as removing the ugly hackage in 
set_security.  This will allow your capabilities to persist through exec().  The 
second patch (cap-2-ext3.patch) adds file capabilities to ext3.  Both are tested 
on 2.6.0-test6, and they apply with fuzz and compile (but not tested yet) on 
-test8.  (These are different from my last attempt at this -- they are much 
closer to POSIX semantics.)
Unfortunately, I think it's too late to include these in 2.6.0.
