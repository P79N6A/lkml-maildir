Right.  Functionally they overlap (lvm can do the equivalent of md
linear) but structurally, the md drivers all operate under the md
framework and user-toolset while lvm has its own framework and toolset.

Since it's just two source files I would leave it in drivers/block/.
If someone starts merging in e.g. IBM lvm components it could make
sense to move it.
