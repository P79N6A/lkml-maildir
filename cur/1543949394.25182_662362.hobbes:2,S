"Less intrusive" in the sense of smaller line count for this particular 
patch, perhaps, but it makes it less obvious when reading the code 
what's going on (a size override in an entirely different file). 
Additionally, I'm hoping these kind of things can be used elsewhere; the 
C99 <inttypes.h> facilities are really quite nice once you get over the 
rather ugly look of them, and I for one definitely miss having access to 
the in the kernel.
