It would seem to me that after hearing how the macros are used in practice,
wouldn't turning them into inline functions be an improvement? This is
something gcc supports, it accomplishes the same thing, and has the added
advantage of type checking.

Or perhaps type checking macro arguments would be another fertile area for
the Stanford Checker...
