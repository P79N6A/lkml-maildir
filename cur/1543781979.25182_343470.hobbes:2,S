Subject: patch for drivers/sound/sb_card.c to recognize mpu_io bootline parameter

Dear developes,
I could not find any maintainer for the sound blaster audio driver so I chose
to address this to the kernel developer list.
Problem:
Unlike in kernels 2.2.X it seems no longer possible to specify during kernel
configuration the sound blaster mpu io address. This might be necessary with
old non-PNP ISA sb cards when not using the sb driver as a kernel module but
directly compiling it in.
The alternative would be to specify that address on boot time via a kernel
option; however sb= supports sb IO address, IRQ, DMA and DMA16 only.
Solution:
Add support for a fifth parameter to sb= representing the sb mpu IO address.
This is what the following patch, developed on Linux 2.4.31, does:

I could not find any documentation that would mention sb=, let alone its
parameters. If that one exists nonetheless it would of course also have to be
complemented.
