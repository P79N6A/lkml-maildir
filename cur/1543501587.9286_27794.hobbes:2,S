As far as I can see your patch adds local cli()s to the interrupt
handlers. This doesn't make too much sense, because they're normally
not reentrant (there will be no other interrupt for this device as long as 
this one isn't acked). It only prevents interrupts for other devices, which 
is bad for interrupt latency. So your change is unnecessary.
