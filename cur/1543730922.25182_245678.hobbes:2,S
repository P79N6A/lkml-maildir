I think this is the main reason of existence for -mm kernels: find problems, 
sort them out and fix them. I've been running -mm kernels since 2.5.80+ and 
all problems I have had were resolved in a timely manner.
What I think is that Con's scheduler is the one that needs to get into -mm 
kernels to give it more exposure. Currently, it has a very limited audience.
