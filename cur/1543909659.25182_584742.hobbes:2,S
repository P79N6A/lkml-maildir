Yup, the "__volatile__" after "__asm__" shouldn't be required. The
previous definitions allowed the compiler to optimize certain atomic
ops away, and considering we haven't seen any bugs due to the past
behaviour anyway, changing it like this sounds unnecessary.
The second behavioral change that comes about here is the force-
constraining of v->counter to memory in the extended asm's constraint
sets. But that's required to give "volatility"-like behaviour, which
I suspect is the goal of this patch.
Sebastian, could you look at the kernel images in detail and see why,
how and what in the text expanded by 1158 bytes with these changes?

Me too, but I do find these more palatable than the variants using
"volatile", I admit.
