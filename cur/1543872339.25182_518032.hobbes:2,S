But it IS okay for people to make special-case schedulers. Because it's 
MY machine, and how it behaves under mixed load is not a technical 
issue, it's a POLICY issue, and therefore the only way you can allow the 
admin to implement that policy is to either provide several schedulers 
or to provide all sorts of tunable knobs. And by having a few schedulers 
which have been heavily tested and reviewed, you can define the policy 
the scheduler implements and document it. Instead of people writing 
their own, or hacking the code, they could have a few well-tested 
choices, with known policy goals.

And has that been a problem with io schedulers? I don't see any vast 
proliferation of them, I don't see contentious exchanges on LKML, or 
people asking how to get yet another into mainline. In fact, I would say 
that the io scheduler situation is as right as anything can be, choices 
for special cases, lack of requests for something else.

This supposes that the desired behavior, the policy, is the same on all 
machines or that there is currently a way to set the target. If I want 
interactive response with no consideration to batch (and can't trust 
users to use nice), I want one policy. If I want a compromise, the 
current scheduler or RSDL are candidates, but they do different things.

We not only have multiple io schedulers, we have many tunable io 
parameters, all of which allow people to make their system behave the 
way they think is best. It isn't causing complaint, confusion, or 
instability. We have many people requesting a different scheduler, so 
obviously what we have isn't "good enough" and I doubt any one scheduler 
can be, given that the target behavior is driven by non-technical choices.
