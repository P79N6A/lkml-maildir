Hi,
Today I tried the new cdparanoia from Debian Sid (3.10+debian~pre0-2).
When I started ripping with "cdparanoia -d /dev/scd0 1" my system
freezes after some seconds. There is no oops and even the console
cursor stops blinking.
If I start cdparanoia with -g /dev/scd0 it starts ripping and but the
kernel prints many "program cdparanoia not setting count and/or
reply_len properly" warnings. But this seems to be a cdparanoia bug.
My CDROM:
Vendor:                    PIONEER
Product:                   DVD-ROM DVD-106
Revision level:            1.22
