No; malloc() still fails, because the 600K allocation exceeds free VM.
Only in the extreme case, "suicide mode" will the situation you
describe arise. (This could be useful if you have code allocating a
single large sparse matrix, for example.)

You are forgetting that disabling overcommit has reduced the available
VM significantly - by the time my overcommit system is really OOM,
yours barfed hours earlier because it had reserved VM just in case.

Why had the process allocated unused memory anyway? In the normal case
(allocate a buffer, then use it) overcommit never comes into play. It
is only if you malloc() a fairly large buffer (a few K or more) and
then do not use it until much later that there is a potential problem.
Just touch memory when you allocate it. Then, you will never have
these problems with implicit allocation of memory (except on the
stack...)

Situation 2 is a BIGGER problem without overcomit. Instead of failing
if there is a REAL problem, the application fails because of a
POTENTIAL problem. No real improvement.
