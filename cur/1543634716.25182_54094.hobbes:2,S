I'm already using the 1.0-2960 version, and that's the version in the 
report. It's possible that the NVdriver module is the cause of the 
problem, but the bug spots in kernel's vm, in a place which it's no 
supposed to, at the point I understand. So, or the module does something 
very ugly, or the kernel really have a bug, or yet it's nothing related 
to the nvdriver. Unfortunately, the backtrace don't help me figuring 
that out, since I'm no vm expert, but perhaps someone will. I may 
attempt to forward this to Nvidia folks, but reporting a bug which only 
spotted once and in a "pre" series kernel may hurt their feelings...
Thanks,
Alexandre
