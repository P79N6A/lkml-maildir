No.
That experimental patch is _experimental_, and has not been reported by
anybody to fix anything at all.  Also, the DMA timeout on PIIX4 seems to
have nothing at all to do with the very silent corruption on VIA. At
least nobody has reported any error messages being produced on the VIA
corruption cases.
In short, let's leave it out of a stable kernel for now, and add
blacklisting of auto-DMA. Alan has a list. We can play around with
trying to _fix_ DMA on the VIA chipsets in 2.5.x (and possibly backport
the thing once it has been sufficiently battletested that people believe
it truly will work).
