Yes.

Occasionally. Sometimes you get a clean trace and its obvious what occurred
from that you can then efficiently find bugs.
And its about efficiency. It isnt an efficienct use of my time to chase bugs
involving vmware.

If the modules don't enable an application to do uncontrolled stuff then
its rarely a big deal. In fact drivers have arrived in the Linux kernel
via the "I got this from my vendor but it crashes when..." route.

2.2.13pre15 - which is I hope what will be 2.2.13. We've fixed a lot of bugs
including some that could cause random crashes. As to the vmware - upgrade
that later - one variable not two...
