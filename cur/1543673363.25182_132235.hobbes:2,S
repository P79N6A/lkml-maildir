It's broken. It will report the kernel values, not the user values like the previous
version and also get it wrong for the current task
(KSTK_* is really a misnomer, it should be USTK_*. WCHAN is handled by a different 
mechanism) 
Something like this should work (untested)
#define KSTK_PTREGS(tsk) \
	((struct pt_regs *)((unsigned long)((tsk)->thread_info) + THREAD_SIZE) - 1)
#define KSTK_EIP(tsk) (KSTK_PTREGS(tsk)->eip)
#define KSTK_ESP(tsk) (KSTK_PTREGS(tsk)->esp)
