Hi, IT WORKED!

command line "linux-new init=/bin/bash i8042.noaux=1 atkbd.reset=1" 
booted 2.6.8.1 kernel with working keyboard. reset succeded. If AUX port 
is what not-keen-on-hardware people call PS/2 port, the problem is 
solved. my mainboard has damaged PS/2 port - it is detected but it does 
NOT work. Thanks for paying attention.
