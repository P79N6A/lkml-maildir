Subject: TCP Congestion Window Bug?

Hi:
TCP only sends a packet if:
         tcp_packets_in_flight(tp) < tp->snd_cwnd
         (function tcp_snd_test in include/net/tcp.h)
but regards transmission as application-limited if
         tp->packets_out < tp->snd_cwnd
         (function tcp_cwnd_validate in include/net/tcp.h)
So the kernel _always_ thinks the connection is
application-limited, forcing many un-necessary
reductions in the size of the congestion window.
I think the condition in tcp_snd_test should be:
         tcp_packets_in_flight(tp) <= tp->snd_cwnd
