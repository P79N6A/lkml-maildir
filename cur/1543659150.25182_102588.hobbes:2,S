At the moment I am not sure. Its stable on my boxes using gcc 3.1 and
built from make distclean. At least one reporter found a patch and
build over an old built tree failed but a clean tree did not.
The obvious candidates assuming 2.4.21-pre3 is stable are the mm/shmem.c 
changes (you can back out just the diff to that file and retest which
would be interesting), or the buffer cache changes which I plan to drop
out to test soon.
Neither of these two changes are due for Marcelo.
Are you using highmem (> 900Mb RAM in the box)
