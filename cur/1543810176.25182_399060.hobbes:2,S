What? That Suspend 2 was stable for me that time? Yes, it definitly
was. The same time when swsusp failed dramatically here, if there was
progress I could not see it that time.

Actually this was on resume, while the kernel was in full control. With
Suspend 2 I could have pressed escape (that is the ugly stuff you
complained about), while I had to fully restart the system with sysrq+b
with swsusp.

Nigel did, that is why the patch is so huge.

I think no such fixes are in Suspend 2, but still it works there.

Read again, I already said that this are some driver problems, and I
think that most of them are already submitted.
But then again, this was about work/not work, and there are still
problems, so there is still efford needed. In this situation it is not
good to just start over, but take the things that are already there and
work with it.

Actually it is, yes. This time is dramatic and includes the full time I
see from a user point of view.
Time for suspend was measured from the time I started hibernate (Suspend
2)/echoed disk into /sys/power/state (swsusp) until the moment the
notebook powered down.
Time for resume was measured from the time I pressed enter in grub and
the system was back will full X and drivers and ready to work.
I think this is a fair time comparision, and it is a dramatic factor of
2. (BTW: the time from powering on the notebook until the grub-menu
comes up takes 3 seconds, so feel free to add this. It would not make a
huge difference.)
However, this test was made with very empty caches, I suspect after some
more work when the caches get filled, this will change even more
dramatically, thanks to LZF compression (which might be in uswsusp, but
is not in swsusp).
> Anyway uswsusp solves that issue.
Maybe it will, but when?
I looks like that we are at the same point we started from: swsusp had a
lot of problems in the past and is still not working so great and also
very slow. Suspend 2 has proved to be stable and reliable for nearly a
year. Work on uswsusp has just started and needs a lot of time to become
mature.
And here is my point again: take the easiest way to make hibernation
working fast, and when that is done start to work on any new
implementation.
