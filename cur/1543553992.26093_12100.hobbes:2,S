Your Suns are using TCP mounts, this got introduced into 2.2.18
somewhere and is a bit broken, do a patch -R with
ftp://oss.sgi.com/www.projects/nfs3/download/nfs_tcp-2.2.17.dif
 and
these go away.  Suns try TCP mounts first.  Be careful to unmount them
first or they will hang waiting for the TCP server to come back up.
