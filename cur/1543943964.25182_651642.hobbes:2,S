Two comments:
* can you regenerate this on top of 2.6.25-rc1?
* take a look at the 'fe' branch of 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git
and see what you think about the work in there.  We need to get cleanups 
like that (and more) upstream.  It also intersects with Tom @ Google's 
"Reduce locking in TX path" patch.
