Hi kernel crew,
this morning my (userspace) nfs daemon crashed unexpectly
while copying 30 or so MB. 
Feb  4 06:18:06 endor kernel: nfs: RPC call returned error 111
Feb  4 06:18:06 endor kernel: RPC: task of released request still queued!
Feb  4 06:18:06 endor kernel: RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
Feb  4 06:18:06 endor kernel: nfs_revalidate_inode: libstdc++/libstdc++.a getattr failed, ino=151323555, error=-111
Feb  4 06:18:12 endor kernel: nfs: RPC call returned error 111
Other side, Linux 2.0.33 nfs server, was deadly crashed and
filesystem was damaged, must be rebooted.
The curious thing, the mountpoint on my client was deleted (?)
and not listed in filesystem. Mount said:
franky:/ on /mnt/franky type nfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,rsize=1024,wsize=1024,addr=192.168.0.6)
but there was no entry /mnt/franky with ls.
After reboot filesystem was not modified and my mountpoint was shown.
... never seen before with 2.0.36.
