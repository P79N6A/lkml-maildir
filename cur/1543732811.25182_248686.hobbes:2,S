Just a few comments.
- There appears to be yet another smc 91C111 driver in there, Takata,
  there should be a unified one in drivers/net/smc91x.c.
- arch/m32r/Kconfig could do with some trimming.
- arch/m32r/kernel/irq.c shows that we really could do with that irq
  consolidation.
- arch/m32r/kernel/m32r_ksyms, EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS is deprecated, use
  EXPORT_SYMBOL.
Thanks,
	Zwane
