I think it would be much too aggressive (_especially_ with preemptible
RCU, I would have thought?). And not just for the case of adding a lot
of idle time while other CPUs are busy not being preempted -- also
that if you have lots of CPUs reclaiming and asking to synchronize_rcu,
then you could have global RCU state getting ping-ponged.

I don't see a really good reason to add this kind of wait here. I mean,
we have to wait for RCU anyway, so we may as well scan what we can
until then?
Putting it in a slowpath at some point when we think we're heading for
OOM I think would be a bit better.
