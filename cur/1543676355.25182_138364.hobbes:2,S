oddly enough, i dont believe the list is iterated in interrupt
context.

yeah, i already read that.  it has a bit of a typo (rtln indeed).
it looks like rtnl_lock() is also used to protect dev_ioctl's
(thus my usage in atm_ioctl) and protect lookup's like __dev_get_by_name.
i didnt get rid of atm_dev_lock, i just dont use it unless writing
or if i couldnt safely use rtnl when a reader is iterating (like
atm_dev_hold() which could be called at interrupt--though no one does).
i thought this was the idea.
