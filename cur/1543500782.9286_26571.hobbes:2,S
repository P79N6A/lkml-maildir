	Yes, this is known as "extent mapping"
	I did some analysis on the topic a while back, and got to a
	concolusion that aside of certain constantly (slowly) growing
	log files, most of my files in the system were under 6 extents.

	Yes, once or twice, but never yet folded back into the kernel
	proper.  My own attempt, although it worked for me, wasn't
	quite generic enough to be used in all cases.  (And likely
	was full of all kinds of hazards and races.)
	Ted Ts'o is working on a generic approach where the metadata of
	extents is stored on a BTREE datastructure.
