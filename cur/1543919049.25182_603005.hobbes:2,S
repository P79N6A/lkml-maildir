Experience of convincing experienced patch author, that some things in
the patch are wrong :)

I vote for more little summaries in the `Subject'(again). Long, boring
threads with whole threading part of screen being empty due to same
subjects isn't fun, when some of thousands of messages can have
interesting stuff inside.
And it's easy not only for mailing list readers now, and for archive
readers also; readers of the www search results (who ever that may be):
google.com/search?q=reviewed+crashkernel
First hit on the review of the patch, i happened to make. And i just
thought "hell, just string parsing, what can be more simply?", yet there
was productive discussion and bug fixing. After i saw convincing
statements about testing, i've placed review mark. Though i'm really
"unimportant" random hacker.
