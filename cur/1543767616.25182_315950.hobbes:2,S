Hi All
  Our ia64 autobuild system has been moved from using
BK to Git. Here we do a nightly pull on Linus's 
(not so mainline) Git tree and test the ia64 build.
This may be a benefit to the Git developers to see
the results of a nightly 'cg-pull'.
Thanks to all for the effort, the conversation from BK
to Git was relatively painless.
