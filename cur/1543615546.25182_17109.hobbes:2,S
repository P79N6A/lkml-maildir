Hi,
I have "lcrash" installed on my system. I have 2.4.8 kernel. I would like
to know how to make a linux system panic so that I can take a crash dump
and analyse using "lcrash". Is there any command to make the system panis
as we have on other unices(SVR4 and unixware)?
Thanks in advance,
Warm regards,
