I've seen precisely that pattern with a couple of IDE controllers. In
both cases they had problems with very large I/O requests. XFS was
generating extremely long linear reads and writes while ext3 tended to
generate nice I/O patterns but never really huge ones.
(The IDE drivers in question have since been fixed except for IT821x
where some firmware versions in raid mode still barf)
