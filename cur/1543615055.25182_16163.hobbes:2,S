That's a bit of apples and oranges ;)
Starting a browser is equivalent to starting a mail client.  In some 
instances it's the same program.
Hitting 2-3 keypresses to archive an email...how do you manage that 
archive v.s. it being managed for you w/ bugzilla?
Logging into bugzilla can be automatic, searching for a bug across the 
archive is in my opinion much more easily done w/ a relational database 
than grepping several mbox files that collect hundreds of messages a 
day.  Not to mention that comments on each bug are localized to -that- 
bug.  All said and done there are a lot of pros and cons from the newbie 
v.s. the 'Linus' perspective.  I think there is at least one or two 
irate persons per week here that have been fighting to find a solution 
to their problem and someone finally speaks up "oh yeah, do this".
It really would be nice to have a reference database -somewhere- where 
we could find answers or even just suggestions about the myriad of 
problems related to the kernel and what the kernel touches.
