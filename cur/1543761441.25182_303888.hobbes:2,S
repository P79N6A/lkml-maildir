I'm not using TV output, and the original patch stated:

I suppose I should renable the TV DAC and see how much power it
actually consumes if I enable it.  It would seem to me that we should
have a way that we can power down whatever parts of the video chipset
that we're not using.  (For example if I don't have anything connected
to the VGA output, it would be good if we could power that down too...)
