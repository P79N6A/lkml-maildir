I have some memory-checker software. I will put it on my
server if anybody is interested.
I have discovered a VM performance problem that somebody should
look into.
The code:
1/	Allocates PAGE_SIZE buffers (using ordinary malloc()) until
	the swap file starts being used (reading /proc --slow).
	These buffers are in a linked-list.
2/	Writes all these buffers to a known pattern.
3/	Does lots of XOR operations, etc., on the buffers.
4/	Reads all the buffers to see if any bits are bad.
5/	Reports any bad stuff. If anything is bad, executes
	an ioctl() to a dummy driver to get the physical address.
6/	Deallocates all the buffers by running down the linked-list.
7/	Continues <forever> to (1) above.
Here is the performance problem observed. If I ^C out of the program,
killing it outright, with the kernel freeing all the allocated data,
everything is fine. There is little or no swap activity as a result
of this.
If the program deallocates all the buffers, as in (6) above, it will
take even up to 1 whole minute!! At this time, there is an enormous
amount of swap-file activity going on.
Since many programs allocate/deallocate data by setting the break address
via malloc(), this represents a severe performance penalty. Deallocating
pages should not result in any swap-file activity! This activity should
occur only when whatever got swapped out, needs to get swapped back in
and nothing needs to get swapped back in during a deallocation!
Since user's pages are not reordered (or should not be), there should
be no swap activity during page deallocation.
This problem is observed on 2.2.17, 2.4.0-test9, and 2.4.0-test12.
Could a VM guru please comment?
Cheers,
