Albert, look at the ext2/ufs/ffs directory layout. You'll see the reason.
Blocks *are* filled. Completely. Fresh directory (after mkdir) looks so:
<inumber><size of 1st record><length of name (1)><name (".")><slack>
<inumber><size of 2nd record><length of name (2)><name ("..")><slack>
<inumber (0, i.e. free><size of the 3rd record><slack>
Each block is filled with records. Some records are marked free. Records
may have a slack in the end. That's it. There is no meaningful sub-block
boundary.
