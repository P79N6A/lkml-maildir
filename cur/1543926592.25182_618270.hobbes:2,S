Just eyeballing your patch I made following observations:
1) make all*config, randconfig, defconfig is broken on 64-bit boxes
2) A pure code refactoring patch is reverted for no obvious reason
3) Behavioral changes are not documented:
   - 32-bit/64-bit can only be selected in config is you specify ARCH=x86
   - ARCH= takes precedence over kernel config for a configured kernel
4) The changelogs miss title on reverted patches
All points are trivial to fix so I do not say your approach is
bad - just that the supplied patch is not good enough.
I will fix it up tonight and test it.
