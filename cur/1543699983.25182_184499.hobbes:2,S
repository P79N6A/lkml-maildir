Never say never:
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.34 seconds = 38.38 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  8.60 seconds =  7.44 MB/sec
/dev/sdb:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.40 seconds = 37.64 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  8.60 seconds =  7.44 MB/sec
<...plus four more just like them...>
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.35 seconds = 38.17 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.05 seconds = 15.79 MB/sec
md0 is a simple RAID0 of all six disks.
Yes, these disks are dirt slow to begin with (Andrew Morton once
mentioned he had pencils that wrote faster than my disks) but apparently
md manages to get some parallelism going, even for sequential reads.
(This is 2.6.0-test11-bk8, FWIW.)
