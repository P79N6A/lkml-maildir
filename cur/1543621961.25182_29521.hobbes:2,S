Hi Marcelo,
as discussed in the thread of your 2.4.18-rc1 announcement (see [1] and
[2]) 2.4.18 adds CONFIG_FB_TRIDENT but the code doesn't compile.  It's
IMHO not a good a idea to add a new option that doesn't compile to a
stable kernel. Please apply the patch below that disables this option as a
workaround to 2.4.18:
