Ah yes simulators are a good example. Yet what matters is whether or not they
would fault on access to the MSR. It is okay if they implement the MSR but
they do not count anything, nor trigger interrupts. The IA-64 ski simulator is
like this and this is just fine, all you get is zeroes and you cannot sample.
