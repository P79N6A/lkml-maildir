I tried this patch against 2.6.17-rc2 (I hoped that it might be fixing my
kswapd oopses too, as they seem related; see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/26/124
 and followups), and it simply makes my
machine hang on bootup -- it seems to make modprobe hang forever on some lock
or something right after it loads raid6.ko (pulled in by evms_activate) in
initramfs. Without the patch, the machine boots just fine.
Since it's on serial console, I've got a SysRq+T log if it helps you.
