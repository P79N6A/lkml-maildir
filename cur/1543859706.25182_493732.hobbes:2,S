Platform specific bug, and has nothing to do with networking.
This problem will occur with any user visible interface definition
that uses __u64, and there are several both in and outside the
networking.
x86 and perhaps others protect the __u64 definition with:
	defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__)
for whatever reason, probably to avoid "long long" or something like
that.  But even that theory makes no sense.
I do not make this protection on any of the sparc ports, even 32-bit
sparc, for example, so I find it really strange that x86 does this.
