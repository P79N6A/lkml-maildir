Yes, sure, sorry. The module (from 2.4.14pre8) loaded perfectly and I could
read /proc/i8k. Also controlling the fans worked. The only thing that didn't
work was the key-thingy. Pressing any of the five keys (those two near the
power button and the Fn-keys) didn't do anything with the i8kbuttons script.
Btw Thank You Very Much!
