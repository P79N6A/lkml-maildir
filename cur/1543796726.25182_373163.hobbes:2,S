Ok. I guess I need help then in seeing why everything belongs in
userspace. Actually, let's revise that for a start - I know you don't
really mean everything, because even you still do the atomic copy in
kernel space... or are you planning on changing that too? :)
I'm not unwilling to be convinced - I just don't see why, with such a
lowlevel operation as suspending to disk, userspace is the place to put
everything. The preference for userspace seems to me to be just that - a
preference.
Regarding improvements to suspend2 being wasted long term, I actually
think that I could port at least part of it to userspace without too
much effort at all. My main concern would be exporting the information
and interfaces needed in a way that isn't ugly, is reliable and doesn't
open security holes. I'm not at all convinced that kmem meets those
criteria. But if you can show me a better way, I'll happily come on
board.
Regards,
Nigel
