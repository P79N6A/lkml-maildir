To me it looks much worse after you changed it as I can understand it at
the moment and afterwards with the ifdefs in, I can't.
Ignoring that issue, why does collie need them disabled? Do they break
collie somehow or is this just because the sharp driver didn't do it?
I'd prefer to keep the charging techniques the same across as many of
the devices as we can and I can't see how this technique causes a
problem. The charging hardware and the battery is very similar across
the models (although you wouldn't believe it looking at the charging
driver).
