Er.. no. I just use the uid_t and gid_t. Are they 64bit? Why are they a problem?

No. That's not my problem, is it? I just provide the mapping system.

The maps are on the client, so that's no issue. The trick is to make it
totally transparent to the filesystem being mounted, be it networked or
non-networked.

I suppose that would be a solution. But now that you know it's on the
client, is it still as big a problem? I don't think so, but I could be
wrong.

That's the way it's done now. If there's no map in the file, it's just
passed through. And of course you don't have to supply any file at all!

Right.

Still, the server does not know this is going on. It's all on the
client, so the memory usage is limited.
