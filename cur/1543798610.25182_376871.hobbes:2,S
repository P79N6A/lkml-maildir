This is almost trivially solvable from userspace (not tested, beware :-):
- check the return code of your write() to /sys/power/state
- if it is ENOMEM (better look into the kernel code if this is what is
  actually reported...), then write "0" to image_size and try again.
or (not as sophisticated, and i am not sure if the paths are all correct):
----
#!/bin/sh
echo 150  > /sys/power/image_size
echo disk > /sys/power/state
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo 0 > /sys/power/image_size
    echo disk > /sys/power/state
fi
----
this will retry on any error (e.g. process not stopped, no swap space
at all, device refused to suspend...) not only on ENOMEM, but echo
unfortunately does not return the error code, only success or failure.
Easy solution would be a small perl or C program.
I am not convinced that this should be handled in the kernel.
