I've fixed the problem in the git tree below, meaning I just did a quick 
compile without defining CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK_XFRM and everything appeared 
to link correctly.  I haven't had a chance to try booting the fix yet because 
my test machine is a little slow compiling right now, but the fix was pretty 
trivial (simply move the extern and the inline function) so I don't expect 
any problems.
