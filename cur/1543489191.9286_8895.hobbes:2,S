Yes and the kernel actually does this. Otherwise we would see much more
stalls. For every incoming ACK it calls tcp_data_snd_check(). 
This either puts new data on the wire or starts the PROBE0 timer. But
if there is currently no data on the write queue (skb==NULL) the function
does nothing. This is the only case where the stall can happen.
 New data arrives via tcp_v4_sendmsg() and for write sizes < mss no
data is put on the wire and the PROBE0 timer is not started.

Agreed.

Im quite sure. The patch looks fine for me. I actually tried this some
days ago , it fixed the stalls even with the broken cleanup_rbuf()
function.

I have the same problem with tcpdump on lo. It shows not all frames.
