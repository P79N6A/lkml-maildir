If you cat /proc/ioports does cpqarray show any registered ioports? I 
think it has a bug that means it doesn't request_region() for the 
ioports it uses and this means that any other driver that tries to 
auto-detect hardware by probing ports can stomp on its toes. This is 
certainly the case for EISA cpqarray controllers which is where I 
found this. I sent a report into arrays@compaq.com or whatever the 
address listed in the maintainers file is but haven't heard anything. 
This bug _may_ only exist for EISA controllers - I couldn't test the 
PCI version since the only machine I have with one in is running that 
other o/s.
