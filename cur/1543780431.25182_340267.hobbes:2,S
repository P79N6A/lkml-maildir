This is where my sugguestion on the ucb1x00 comess in
(although it seems to have ot lost as I have had no
reply :-( ). To repeat myself:
I was thinking of something like driver/bus into which
we might also be able to put the I2C and LL3 buses.
The only problem is that this might leave some parts
of the multi function chip homeless (if they can't
find a home in other subsystems).
I need to do more homework ;-), but
I think we need a bus driver (I need to see what the
bus subsystem offers) (IP block specific,
platform and arch independent), a core driver to
register busses and clients, and client drivers.
