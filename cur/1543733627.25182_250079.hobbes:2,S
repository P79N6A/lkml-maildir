Doing SIGBUS on ia64 was painful, due to the way the CPU chooses to not 
generate errors until bad data is actually consumed, but that's the approach 
we're taking at the moment.  I'd rather have the ioctls though, so I'm glad 
you're up for it.  My hope is that we can have a unified Linux device access 
method in X and get rid of all (or at least most) of the ppc/sparc/ia64/etc. 
specific hacks in the tree...
