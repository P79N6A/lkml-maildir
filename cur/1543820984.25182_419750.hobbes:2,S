FWIW, userspace is moving away from C as unproductive and unsafe. KDE is 
of course C++, mozilla, openoffice are C++, and gnome is moving towards 
(of all things) C#.
GCC considered adopting a C++ subset. My impressions of the discussion 
was that (a) a majority of the developers would like that (b) RMS would 
never allow it (c) there were concerns about bootstrap on platforms 
where a C++ compiler was not available.
Kernels of other operating systems (Windows, AIX (?)) allow C++. And 
don't start about Windows crashing whenever you sneeze at it - it's so 1998.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
