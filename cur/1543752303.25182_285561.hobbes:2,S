Which did not have any locks at all, and was broken for hotplug systems.

Yeah, blame me for that, but it was race proof for hotplug boxes.

Which is because I didn't think of that in the first place, sorry.

We now have a simple macro to iterate over all pci devices, in a
reference count and lock safe manner.
The next change will be to just delete the thing alltogether, as most
all drivers shouldn't be walking the list of pci devices in the first
place.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know I can't really do that, as there are lots of
places where it is valid to do so, but I can dream...
