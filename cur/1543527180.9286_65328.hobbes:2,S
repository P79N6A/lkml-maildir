Not really --- there is no reliable way to determine that it is the same
disk which has been replaced, and queuing things to the wrong disk would
be fatal.  You're also risking serious virtual memory deadlock problems
if you "pin" that dirty data without hope of writeback for an extended
period of time, although that effect could be limited with work.
