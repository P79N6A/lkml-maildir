Why?  What do you propose we do then?  Wait a year?  Two years?  I've
already stated that I'm going to wait 3 more months in order to be able
to fix up the currently supported distros to handle the changes needed.
I'll even dig up RC4 to get that working, as it shouldn't be that hard
to do so.  What more can I do?

No, but it does show that you are running on an unsupported distro.  Why
should the kernel developers have to support this?  When is the cut-off
date?

And that's the only group of people who would try to do this.
Seriously, I don't see the complaint here.  It's an unsupported distro
by the very makers of that distro.  How long should the community have
to care about a distro after the creators of it have abandonded it?

Not if we want to keep on making things better.  The real reason I made
these changes is to get power management working better.  We need to get
the devices into the proper place in the sysfs tree in order to handle
suspend/resume for classes of devices properly.  That's what Linus's
patch did, and now I'm moving the devices to allow it to really happen.
thanks,
