No, Chris is pointing out that an an O_DIRECT write can leave clean  
read pages in the page cache.
All it takes is giving a source buffer for the write which is an mmap 
()ed apeture of the region that is being written to.  If you get the  
offsets right you can get the get_user_pages() down in fs/direct-io.c  
will populate the page cache before the actual O_DIRECT write gets to  
it.
