Absolutely agreed.  I've already seen it happen a few times that
a user needed _2_ binary-only modules, modules which weren't even
available for the same kernel version.
As it stands right now it is IMPOSSIBLE to support binary only
drivers and I can only see two ways out of this situation:
(1) don't allow binary only modules at all
(2) have a stable ABI for binary only modules and don't allow
    these binary only modules to use other symbols, so people
    in need of binary only modules won't be locked to one
    particular version of the kernel (or have two binary only
    modules locked to _different_ versions of the kernel)
kind regards,
Rik
