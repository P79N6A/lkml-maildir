What I meant to say was, if a thread has just exited, since we do not use
locks anymore in ST case, the read of signal->utime may happen out of order,
(excuse long lines)
Last thread (RUSAGE_SELF)		Exiting thread
k_getrusage()				__exit_signal()
	.					.
	load sig->utime (hoisted read) 		.
	.					sig->utime = cputime_add(sig->utime, tsk->utime);
	.					sig->stime = cputime_add(sig->stime, tsk->stime);
						.
						.
						spin_unlock(&sighand->siglock); --> (A)
						.
					__unhash_process()
						.
						detach_pid(p, PIDTYPE_PGID);
	if (!thread_group_empty())		.
	.
	don't take any lock based on if --> (B)
	.
	.
	utime = cputime_add(utime, p->signal->utime); /* use cached load above */
	stime = cputime_add(stime, p->signal->stime); /* load from memory */
So although writes happen in order due to (A) above, there is no guarantee
interms of read order when we do not take locks,(as far as my understanding
goes)  so I think a rmb() is needed at (B), else as in this example, some 
counters may have values before the exiting thread updated  the sig-> fields 
and some after the thread updated the sig-> fields.  This might have a 
significant effect than the task_struct->xxx inaccuracies.  Of course 
this is theoretical.  This was not a possibility earlier because 
__exit_signal and k_getrusage() could not run at the same time due to the 
exiting thread taking tasklist lock for write and k_getrusage thread taking 
the lock for read.
I am also cc'ing experts in memory re-ordering issues to check if I am
missing something :)
I think we need a rmb() at sys_times too based on the above. I will make a
patch for that.

We know we don't need locks there, so I do not understand why we
should keep them.  Locks are always serializing and expensive operations.  I
believe on some arches disabling on-chip interrupts is also an expensive
operation...some arches might use hypervisor calls to do that which I guess
will have its own overhead...so why have it when we know we don't need it?
Thanks,
