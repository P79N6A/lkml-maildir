Still shouldn't cause such a big slowdown. Seems like they
might be getting written off the end of the page reclaim
LRU (although in that case it is a bit odd that increasing
the dirty thresholds are improving performance).
I don't think we have any vmscan metrics for this... kswapd
definitely has become more active in 2.6.9-rc. If you're stuck
for ideas, try editing mm/vmscan.c:may_write_to_queue - comment
out the if(current_is_kswapd()) check.
It is a long shot though. Andrew probably has better ideas.
