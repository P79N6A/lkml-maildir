? I never said I copied it into RAM. The ramfs is just used for /tmp &
/var
which are symlinks on the flash. I didn't know you could read/write
cramfs
like ext2/JFFS2? I still want to be able to update/create/delete files
like a normal ext2 partition. Oh I see the confusion, sorry my fault,
when
I said the root filesystem is compressed ext2, I meant it's ext2 with
chattr +c done on all files (the e2compr patch implmenents it). By the
way why isn't e2compr a standard part of the kernel. I've have no
problems
at all with it.
I didn't know about union-mounting, seems useful.
As for whether to use tmpfs/ramfs I think they do basically the same
thing 
only the implementation is different. tmpfs uses shared mem and so is 
probably more portable than ramfs which it tightly coupled with VFS. I
think I'll use ramfs (with limits patch) so.

How much more efficent is JFFS than say ext3+e3compr, wrt:
logic size/logic speed/RAM requirements/filesystem structure size.
