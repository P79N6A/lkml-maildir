Thanks, I discovered and was building that after I discovered the
"development and/or incomplete code/drivers" option is also required.
My system would not boot without SIIMAGE too, is that expected?
Should there be a dependency in menuconfig?
Sad news, at about 800 Mb, pdflush stopped completing and the device
was blocked.
Oooh, guess I needed to mount as a scsi dev now? but I don't see any
scsi devices available... must I first not mount the hdc partitions?
