thanks for your answer. the error messages are vanished for now. i
switched on/of the power supply for the hd-box sometimes and then it
suddenly worked normaly. it even negotiates  with  3 Gbps and UDMA/133.
Dec 18 13:05:50 proto1 ata2: SATA link up 3.0 Gbps (SStatus 123 SControl
300)
Dec 18 13:05:50 proto1 ata2.00: ATA-6: WD      My Book ES, 012, max
UDMA/133
maybe it is the cable, i have to investigate it. it also claimes to have
an automatic power on/off function, whatever this should mean.
best regards
