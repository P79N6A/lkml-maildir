Are you in a position to test a kernel without preempt? I have a
sneeking suspicion that its related to that.

There isn't anything similar at the moment, however we do know about
that and there is a bugzilla entry relating to it, #221300. I don't
think that in this case it will help though since I think this is
something more fundamental in the locking code.
I'll see if I can reproduce something similar locally in the mean time,
Steve.
