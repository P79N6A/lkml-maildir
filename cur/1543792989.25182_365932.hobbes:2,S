The capability I was talking about was the ability to figure out where 
the configured hugetlb pages are going (vs is this a hugetlb page?).
I suspect that one can use lsof+/proc/pid/maps and look for hugetlbfs 
mount points to gather that data. But for shared memory hugepages, we 
don't have a way.

Why do we need shmctl(IPC_STAT) then? Applications should remember what 
they did :)
