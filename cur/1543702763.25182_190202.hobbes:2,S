Yes.

cardmgr doesn't play a part when you've inserted a cardbus card - it
doesn't even know that a card has been inserted into the slot.

It's all done via the hotplug subsystem, which is integrated into the
driver model.
Basically, we discover that a cardbus card has been inserted, and ask
the PCI layer to scan the slot.  We add the new device to the list of
PCI devices, which automatically causes the hotplug system to call
/sbin/hotplug for the new PCI device.
The hotplug scripts are then supposed to load the driver as necessary
(using /etc/modules.conf) which creates a network interface.  This then
causes the hotplug scripts to be invoked again, this time for the new
network interface, which should configure it.
