Subject: linux-2.4.0-test5 slowed down unusable with OOM

this simple c app will make 2.4.0-test5 such slow,
it's unusable. i saw some progress in the xterm running this app,
but it was not possible to do anything else (like ctr-alt-f1 or
ctrl-alt-del, mouse and keyboard strokes also had no effekt).
ping to the box worked still.
it might be nice to kill the app much sooner,
instead of swapping for hours.
regards, andreas
