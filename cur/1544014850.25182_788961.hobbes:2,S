Subject: Too async libata breakage

commit f29d3b23238e1955a8094e038c72546e99308e61 aka
"fastboot: Make libata initialization even more async"
results in no findable /dev/sda2 to mount / here.
Kernel correctly sees sda as 750GB drive and the rest too.
CONFIG_ATA_PIIX is in use, everything built-in, plain partitions,
no initrd, DM, MD etc.
