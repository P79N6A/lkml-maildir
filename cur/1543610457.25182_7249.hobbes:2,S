Subject: [PATCH] remove trailing whitespace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This (23MB! (5Mb compressed)) patch removes trailing whitespace from
all files in the kernel, thereby reducing size from 121,865,495 to
121,640,841. I.E. reducing size by 224,654 bytes. I don't know if it's
of any use, but it should be applied now if it is going to be done
at all.
