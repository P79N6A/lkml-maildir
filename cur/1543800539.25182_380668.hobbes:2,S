Subject: unable to mount root device in 2.6.14.5  (was: Re: [PATCH] PCI patches for 2.6.10)

Hello,
I just upgraded from Kernel 2.6.10 to 2.6.14.5 and got this message:
PCI: Unable to reserve I/O region #1:100@10000 for device 0000:00:06.0
instead of the usual initialisation messages of my scsi controller. As
a consequence no scsi device and thus no root device is found. 
I tracked this down to this patch (to be precise, the PCI_CLASS_NOT_DEFINED 
part of it). Removing the 'class == PCI_CLASS_NOT_DEFINED ||' clause makes
it boot again.

Your patch description suggests that a platform specific solution might be
better. So can you point me tho the right place under arch/alpha to implement
this? Or would a patch to remove the comparison be acceptable?
Thanks,
Thorsten
