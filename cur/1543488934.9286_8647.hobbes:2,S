APM power-off doesn't not work on my mother's computer - halt -p makes the
kernel get a kernel panic.
I suppose this is yet another occurence on noncompliant APM bioses
expecting certain things (like being in real mode with certain segments
available...).
Is somebody working on working around this? I know the BIOS is broken,
but there are already so many kludges around hardware problems...
