Hi, 
On 2.3.51 with devfs and framebuffer support (not as module)
for a Matrox Millenium II, the top of the display turns into
a white block (with the exception of the little Tux) where
you ususally see messages such as the following:
e820: 0009fc00 @ 00000000 (usable)
e820: 00000400 @ 0009fc00 (usable)
e820: 00010000 @ 000f0000 (reserved)
e820: 00010000 @ ffff0000 (reserved)
e820: 03f00000 @ 00100000 (usable)

Obviously, not a critical problem.  Sometimes it reminds me
that I don't have a Sun workstation though. :)
