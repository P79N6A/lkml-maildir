That's caused by vmware bodules; I don't think they affect the situation.

What's the correct place for those? do_IRQ()? Or probably some other places 
also (APIC timer interrupt handler? exception handler?)
Unpleasant situation is that the problem is on a production server, which 
should be operational 24/7 ...  However, probably I'll try to install an 
instrumented kernel in the next kernel upgrade.
