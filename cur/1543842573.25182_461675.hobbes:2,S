Yeah, that's the current situation. I think pretty much everyone would 
like to see it die off, though :)

Right. My prime concern in this case is that userspace ends up seeing 
the drive for a significant period of time despite it having been 
removed.

Really? Ouch. I did hack up some vague support for pata hotswap some 
time ago, but dropped it when I realised that there wasn't a terribly 
easy way to remove a single device in drivers/ide. Removing an entire 
bus isn't helpful when your test machine has the hard drive and CD drive 
on the same channel.

The idea was to add something to init_scsi in drivers/scsi/scsi.c along 
the lines of scsi_platform_register(). On most platforms this would be a 
noop, but on ACPI systems it would do something like pci_acpi_init does 
in drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c. That way when SCSI devices (including libata 
ones) get registered, there's a callback into the scsi-acpi code which 
can associate them with the appropriate ACPI address. When an event is 
received that can then be handled by the scsi-acpi code, which has the 
corresponding SCSI device structure and can call the relevant hotplug 
code.
The added advantage of this is that it would allow fairly clean 
integration of the ACPI suspend/resume methods for PATA and SATA 
devices, plus any further information that ever gets exposed via ACPI.

 is the relevant part of the 
discussion, though the patch appears somewhere earlier in the thread. As 
Jeff mentions the SCSI layer may not be the ideal place to do this, 
though I haven't checked whether it's straightforward to do it in libata 
itself yet. Even if not, it wouldn't be hard to swap the code over when 
necessary.
