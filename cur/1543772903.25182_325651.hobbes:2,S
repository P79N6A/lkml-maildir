The idea is from the OpenSolaris sources, the implementation is 
independant. Actually OpenSolaris doesn't contain an implementation at 
all, it just mentions the idea.
Jim: From my understanding of the CDDL, only a file that "contains any 
part of the Original Software" must be licensed under the CDDL, there 
are no restrictions (except possibly patents, but I assume that even the 
USPTO won't grant a patent on such a trivial idea) on using methods or 
ideas from OpenSolaris in software that uses other licenses.
Is that correct?
