In my opinion, the priorities in address selection should be the following:
 1. always use prefsrc if it is specified
 2. then for local routes, use destination
 3. as a last resort, call that function guessing the address...

I would say that using of bound sockets is a bit risky.
I'm not sure whether such a connect may succeed with 2.2 kernels and
transparent proxy support, for example.
An unbound UDP connect, as autofs does, is a good solution if the mistakes are
acceptable.
The behavior of autofs in case of a mistake, as Peter explained, looks
reasonable and acceptable for me.
Using GETROUTE as Andi suggested is the other good alternative.
But it won't work without NETLINK socket support compiled in.
