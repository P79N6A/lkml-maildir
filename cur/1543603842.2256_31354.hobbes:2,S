Well, it SHOULDN'T affect the suspend...  I should have been more
precise here, but this was described in an earlier thread: the bug
does indeed prevent the machine from entering suspend mode at all.

In fact, it turns out that the power management callback routine
doesn't check whether a suspend or a resume event triggered it.  More
importantly, it doesn't provide a return value either.  This explains
what happens: The power management code looks for a status value
returned by the callback and gets a more or less random int, which
usually dosn't happen to be 0 (== successful suspend).
I've written a little patch (not included yet) that makes
pckbd_pm_resume behave well in connection with the current incarnation
of the power management code.  Suspend and resume work again without
problems.
Unfortunatly, now the actual tweeks done by the callback seem to
slightly confuse my keyboard driver...?  Will look into that soon.
