If you have any user-mode 'kernel' utilities, you need to be
extremely careful because you can build code that doesn't work.
That's why you should use an 'include' search path on the
compiler command line when you are compiling these. The search
path should point to the kernel headers of the version you
intend to use. The kernel tries to remain compatible, but
when you access internal structures, compatibility may be lost.

Yes. One can usually 'trust' a distribution and use whatever they
shipped.

No. User-mode programs must never, never, never, ever include
kernel headers directly. Instead, if they are for kernel utilities,
the include search-path must be explicitly set.

This is one of the newer places that's been defined. It's probably
worthless because it's just another sim-link! And, it's a sim-link
to some kernel source that probably doesn't exist anymore. You
need to explicitly define where you want the include-search-path
to include when you compile kernel-specific things. In other words,
when compiling things that interface with the kernel or with
kernel internals, there is no free lunch. You need to know exactly
what you are doing.

Kernel modules must use the headers for the kernel version you
wish to run. That is not necessarily the kernel that is running
now. That's why you need to define the search-path for the
'include' files.

Yes. You need to keep user-space and kernel space seperate.
