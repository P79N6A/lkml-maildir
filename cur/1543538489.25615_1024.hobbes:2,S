Hi folks,
yesterday I replaced my old 64MB SDRAM module w/o parity with a 128MV
SDRAM with parity on my ASUS P2B.
Now I'm having problems with X terminating about every 20 minutes
when working with larger programs like gimp, netscape or mozilla.
There's no slowing down or any other strange behaviour but X is suddenly
terminated. (2.2.16 with xf-3.3.5)
Any hints?
