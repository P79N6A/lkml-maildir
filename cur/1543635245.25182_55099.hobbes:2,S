Hi,
	thanks for the reply.  From an application point of view, when a
socket is created it is non-blocking by default.  If the application uses
ioctl or fcntl to set the socket to non-blocking mode, then all I was saying
was I don't see any indication in flags or msghdr->flags as to whether the
user wants to wait for the recv to complete or not.  How is my recvmsg()
function in my implementation of the new address family supposed to
differentiate.  I cannot see any reference to O_NONBLOCK or MSG_DONTWAIT in
the tcp_recvmsg() function.
Kevin

non-blocking is a matter of behavior. It easily doesn't block.
The man page says
 O_NONBLOCK or O_NDELAY
	When  possible,  the file is opened in non-blocking
	mode. Neither the open nor  any  subsequent  opera-
	tions on the file descriptor which is returned will
	cause the calling process to wait.   For  the  han-
	dling  of  FIFOs  (named  pipes), see also fifo(4).
	This mode need not have any effect on  files  other
	than FIFOs.
So it shouldn't work outside FIFOs. However, have a look at net/ipv4/tcp.c 
for more details.
