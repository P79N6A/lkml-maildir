I've got some suggestions for you.
First: be humble (sorry, I don't want to offend you at all) read the 
LKML FAQ. the address is at the very end of this email. it would give 
you the pointers you want. (including books/web pages).
second: bear in mind that Linux driver structure is not like minix. 
minix is Micro kernel, Linux is not. therefore, there is no main loop 
here. you just register the required device specific operations and you 
will receive all open/read/write/ioctl/close requests. (pls. See the 
design of Unix operating system for more information).
third: look for a similar device driver implementation in kernel (well, 
it is learning in the hard way :-) ) .
Good luck,
Masoud
