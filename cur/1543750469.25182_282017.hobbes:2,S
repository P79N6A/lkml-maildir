There's two different problems: the one seen by Thomas (the Xilinx FPGA
synthesizer), which is apparently just due to Wine (or, more likely, the
Windows app itself) depending on a certain memory layout for the stack
and/or other allocations. That one I think we can consider solved, and
indeed had nothing to do with TF.
The other one is the copy-protection code breaking for some game 
(Warcraft) for Jesse Allen, and that one is definitely TF-related.. Jesse 
can fix it with patches, but those patches aren't acceptable for other 
uses, so that's why I'm trying to find something that DTRT both for Wine 
and for a regular debugging session..
