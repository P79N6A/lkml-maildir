Anyone know offhand if the 2.4 kernel supports kernel profiling
via /proc/profile for ppc?
(Support for this for the 2.2 kernel was posted on 18 Aug 2000; see
http://members.xoom.com/greyhams/linux/patches/2.2/profile.patch
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=96684695930338&w=2
Unfortunately the patch in question is offline so it's hard
to just download it and check to see if it's in the source...)
Thanks,
Dan
