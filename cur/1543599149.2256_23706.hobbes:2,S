         after 4 hours of playing sound, ac11
    crashed too. this happened when i restarted esound.
         additional info: trace-pattern changed.
    now there was alot(6-7) of traces, and then host hung.
         additional unrelated info.
    apps still loses tty, but _much_ rarer...
    When i was hit, i had to restart playmp3list
    4 times to make it work normally, because it
    had lost tty immediately after each start.
    then suddenly all became ok.
    going to download ac12

cheers,
