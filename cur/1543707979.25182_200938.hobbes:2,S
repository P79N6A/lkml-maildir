That's a bit beside the point.  I was replying to the assertion that
everyone agreed to use UTF-8.  (And particularly, for large character sets.)
> UTF-16 is not an option;
Of course.  Perhaps my use of reductio al absurdum was unclear.  I was
trying to show that UTF-8, despite its sanity, is not universally agreeable.
The actual reason is because it came late to the scene (around 20 years ago)
and it is not backwards compatible.  But to make the point, I compared it
with UTF-16 which is equally not universally agreeable.
> it's not POSIX compatible,
OK, UTF-8 has one less reason than UTF-16 has, for being not universally
agreeable.  But the biggest reason still remains, as mentioned above.

Well, I thought I described them as I saw them used in Unix.  I no longer
have access to machines running commercial Unix systems, but some of the
stty options were the way I did describe.  I have a feeling that System V
might have implemented them slightly differently from BSD-based systems, but
regardless, the same functionality was pretty much "universally" needed and
implemented.
If you're asking whether I noticed similar stty options in Linux, I didn't
notice because of the reason mentioned (I just opened another terminal
emulator window using the locale that I temporarily needed).  But I'll try
to remember to look next weekend.  Sorry, I'm leaving for work in a minute
and can't look now.
