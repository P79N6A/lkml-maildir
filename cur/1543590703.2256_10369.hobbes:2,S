You are using binary only drivers. We can't debug them (least of all a 625K
module thats almost the size of the kernel).  Duplicate the problems on a boot
that never loaded vmware or nvdriver and its interesting, otherwise take it
up with vmware and nvidia - they have our source we dont have theirs
