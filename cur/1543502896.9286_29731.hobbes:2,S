Certainly you knew it couldn't be that easy.  The problem is that you've
gotta send the signal to some particular pid.  That pid won't be dedicated
to "multiplexing" signals... it needs to receive its own thread signals as
well.  That's the problem there.  So whatever you do, you'll need some way
to decide between delivering a signal to a process, or searching that
process's "group" for an appropriate process to receive the signal.
