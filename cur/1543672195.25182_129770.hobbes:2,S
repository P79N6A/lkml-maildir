No Alan and Kai are right.
The problem with the Infineon ISDN chips is that the fifos are small and so IRQ 
latency is relativ critical. 32 or 64 bytes are only 4/8 ms, and if one of these
32 Byte is dropped, the complete frame is lost. Modern ethernet cards allways
have fifos for multiple complete frames, so that such things don't happen here.
You can try to use HFC based ISDN cards (e.g. Conrad: ISDN TA 128K) the
fifos are much bigger (7.5kB) so at least 4 complete 1500 byte frames can be 
handled without segmentation. That increase the IRQ latency a lot (~900 ms).
