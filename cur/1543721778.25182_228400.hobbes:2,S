And they have problems for which fixes were merged into the
upstream kernel well over a year ago.
If these developers had just merged their own stuff into the
upstream kernel, they wouldn't have had to deal with all the
ancient kernel bugs - the community has solved them already
and the embedded developers could just inherit those fixes
from upstream.
In short, the work of merging your functionality back upstream 
is a way to reduce the total amount of work that needs to be done.
