This started as fork from the cloop-0.6x.
Now the file format is almost the same, but the code is quite different: 
the only thing that remains is the the basic logic and the block unpacker.
The current code is currently under testing for gentoo livecd and other 
projects that use the same tecnology, at least that I'm aware.
If Klaus thinks that gcloop is good enough for his knoppix I'd be glad.
Currently gcloop-0.99 uses 32bit indexes since my target are livecd, for 
livedvd would be better use the newer cloop-2.0/1.0 file format with 
64bit indexes.
gcloop isn't file format compatible with the old cloop-0.68 fileformat 
since I had to use in a different way the index and I prefer ucl instead 
of zlib.
