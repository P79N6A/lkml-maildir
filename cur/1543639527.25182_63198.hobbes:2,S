i have many oops when i'm unmounting the filesystem.
i can't get a oops file, and ksymoop doesn't get anything.
the oops comes only when i'm unmounting my filesystems.
there are a reiserfs and a ext3fs.
sorry for these informations.
i'm trying to get a oops file from ksymoops or others utilities.
best regards
