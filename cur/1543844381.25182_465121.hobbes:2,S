Works for me. We do need to keep pushing drivers each cycle (and we need
faster cycles just to keep up with the chipset people) but a situation
where people are told to keep those driver updates working with the old
core code would be fine (ie as 2.4 sometimes was) for some of the cycles
when they are not the goal.
