Hi,
I had a design problem of a Linux module (Linux 2.6.11) that lead me to do this:
int work_fn(void* data);
task_t my_task;
task_t* kthread = kthread_create(work_fn, NULL, "Task 1");
// assume kthread create was successfully...
my_task = *kthread;
// change what current maceo points to...
kthread->thread_info->task = &my_task;
...
...
wake_up_process(&my_task);
...
..
well... is it dangerous to change what current macro points to through
changing thread_info->task?
Please help!
Thanks for help in advance!
