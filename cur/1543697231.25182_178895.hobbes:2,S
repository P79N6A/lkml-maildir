I had a terminal with eGalax touchscreen for tests some time ago and it
worked.
But for new USB core (Linux 2.4.20+) it required a patch (unpatched
driver worked on 2.4.18 but caused Oops on 2.4.20):
http://cvs.pld-linux.org/SOURCES/touchkit-2.4.20.patch
(yes, it uses old GNU-style initializers, now I would use C99-style)
