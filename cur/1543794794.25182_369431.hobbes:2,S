Hey,
ok, I just thought you wanted me to say that. ;) But what's the problem
then? I didn't change any configs (expect the 'udev is no longer loading
mousedev'-problem on Debian - I put mousedev into /etc/modules).
However, this doesn't affect the mouse in 2.6.15-rc1 and 2.6.15-rc2. Is
this a timing issue? udev-detected modules get loaded earlier than
/etc/modules modules get loaded in Debian, don't they?. Maybe some resource
mess?
