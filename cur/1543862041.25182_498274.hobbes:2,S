You didn't mention another problem, a VMA maybe residents on multiple zones. To
multiple address space, multiple memory inode architecture, we can introduce
a new core object -- section which has several features
1) Section is used as the atomic unit to contain the pages of a VMA residing in
  the memory inode of the section.
2) When page migration occurs among different memory inodes, new secion should
  be set up to trace the pages.
3) Section can be scanned by the SwapDaemon of its memory inode directely.
4) All sections of a VMA are excluded with each other not overlayed.
5) VMA is made up of sections totally, but its section objects scatter on memory
  inodes.
So to the architecture, we can deploy swap subsystem on an
architecture-independent layer by section and scan pages batchly.

You mean add a new swap file/partition? I scan every UserSpaces by
init_mm::mmlist which has already been used by swap subsystem, and I've patched
in mm/swapfile.c.

I've noticed FreeBSD maybe has a similar design as I mentioned, I'm reading
their code to whether they have another two features -- UnmappedPTE and dftlb in
my Documentation/vm_pps.txt.
