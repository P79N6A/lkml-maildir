I pointed that out to the folk who proposed this and
gave him a fix that ensures that the child has at least a value of 2
higher.
Given the child all and the parent nothing is TOTAL BOGUS. The parent
essentially has to wait for a recalculate.
This so-called fix has to go in the next release.

        I only did that because I could not find another way
to make the child run first that worked in practice.  I tried
other things before that.  Since Peter Osterlund's SCHED_YIELD
thing works, we no longer have to give all of the CPU to the
child.  The scheduler time slices are currently enormous, so as
long as the child gets even one clock tick before the parent runs,
it should reach the exec() if that is its plan.  1 tick = 10ms = 10
million cycles on a 1GHz CPU, which should be enough time to encrypt
my /boot/vmlinux in twofish if it's in RAM.
