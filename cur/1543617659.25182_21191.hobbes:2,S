When I last used it it was 2.4.3 or something back then.

I stopped using Linux for a while and decided to install it over again and
found the video non-working (2.4.10), then I decided to upgrade and had the
same symptoms.  I had just recompiled a whole load of old kernels to see
under which it broke when all of a sudden I came across a web page stating
that acceleration didn't work on Rage 128 Pro chipsets, exactly what I have.
So I tried adding the "noaccel" kernel parameter (which I didn't used to
have to add) and it now works without a hitch under 2.4.18-pre3.  Go figure.
Thanks anyway,
