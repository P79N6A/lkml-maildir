Yes, that's what I was trying to get at.

Typically forward decl is enough, it's just that typedef that's
problematic.  But, it's not an issue, I was just clarifying that it
wasn't a core part of the patch, rather prep work.

I was looking for places where rka->context is referrenced assuming it
didn't go away (i.e. Oops waiting to happen).  Given the non-interrupitble
wait, this isn't possible.

That's a good idea.  I do appreciate the nice explanation.

Hmm, so we'll need a way for it to assume an identity, label and all.

Hehe, it was me, I blame overexposure to diapers ;-)
