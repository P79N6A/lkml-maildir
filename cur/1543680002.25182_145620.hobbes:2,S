Subject: Patch for 3.5/0.5 address space split
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Could anybody point out to patches available for 3.5/0.5 address 
space split for 2.4 and 2.5 kernels?
Any other working options? I managed to compile 2.4.21 kernel 
with 1/3 split, but not with 0.5/3.5. The last one simply doesn't 
boot. What could I be doing wrong?
Thanks
Giga
