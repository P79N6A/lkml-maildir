Hi,
Sorry for joining late, just a small annotation:

ACPI S4 turns off the machine completely and you can remove the battery (this
is even required somewhere in the spec). Any state saving is done in CMOS RAM
or flash.
But for example many Notebooks resume much faster if they go through the
ACPI S4 hooks during suspend (less than one second from "lid open" to "grub"
while they need ~10 seconds through the BIOS on a "normal" boot.
My Toughbook resumes on "Lid Opened" after S4, it doesn't after a shutdown.
So there will be differences.
I'm not saying that they are too important, but 20% faster resume still is
a good saving for me.
No need to restart this thread btw ;-)
Have fun,
    Stefan
