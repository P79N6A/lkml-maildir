Hello:
When I try to add IDE in /proc, it did the following thing:
ide_register_hw -> ide_revalidate -> grok_partitions -> msdos_partition ->
read_dev_sector -> sync_page -> __run_task_queue
When it tried to do f(data) in kernel/softirq.c in __run_task_queue,
error happens:
Unable to handle NULL pointer dereference at address 0x0000000
...
It's in the tq_struct, but what situation will cause this?
Thanks,
Jerry
