Could you explain why they can't coexist on the same PCI bus.  The
only problem I see with having all three cards DMA at the same time is
increased latency.  But he's getting CRC errors on the transfer
between the card and the drive, and that doesn't seem like a latency
issue.
I know Promise does funky stuff with their DMA, but I'm curious why no
more than two cards can co-exist on the same PCI bus.
