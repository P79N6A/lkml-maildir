however, this can be automaticly tested (or at least the config options 
specified can be tested)

this cannot be tested by anyone who doesn't use the driver in question, and 
frequently that includes the programmer who makes the changes.
there's no way to protect against a logic error in a driver, however it is 
possible to put a safety net in place to catch compile problems due to mistakes.
should such a net be put into place? (along with asking submitters what compile 
options are relavent to their code), or is this a mistake that is rare enough to 
just live with it when it happens?
