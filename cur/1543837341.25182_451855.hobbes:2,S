OK, so far so good, except we loose the notion of getting memory back
from
regular skbs.

dev_reserve_used() uses atomic_read() which isn't actually a LOCK'ed 
instruction, so that should not matter.

Not quite, if IFF_MEMALLOC is set new skbs _could_ get memalloc set. We
only
fall back to alloc_pages() if the regular path fails to alloc. If the
skb
is backed by a page (as opposed to kmem_cache fluff) sk_buff::memalloc
is set.

Your reasoning is sound, except for these two point above...

Ouch, where was my brain... Thanks!
Also, I've been thinking (more pain), should I not up the reserve for
each
SOCK_MEMALLOC socket.
