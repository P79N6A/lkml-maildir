Hi,
I have a question concerning the macro atomic_inc on REDHAT 9.0. I had used
atomic_inc on REDHAT 7.2 earlier. I installed redhat 9.0 and tried to run my
old code on this. I got the error saying atomic_inc not declared.
I tried to search the header file in which this is defined but with failure.
If any of u guys know about this problem pls help me ...
thx in advance
Sankarshana M
