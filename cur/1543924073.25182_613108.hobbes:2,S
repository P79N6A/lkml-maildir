Actually, what I had/have is a cond_resched_rwlock() that I needed to
convert the i_mmap_lock() to rw for testing reclaim scalability.  [I've
seen a large system running an Oracle OLTP load hang spitting "cpu soft
lockup" messages with all cpus spinning on a i_mmap_lock spin lock.]
One of the i_mmap_lock paths uses cond_resched_lock() for spin locks.
To do a straight forward conversion [and maybe that isn't the right
approach], I created the cond_resched_rwlock() function by generalizing
the cond_sched_lock() code and creating both spin and rw lock wrappers.
I took advantage of the fact that, currently, need_lockbreak() is a
macro and that both spin and rw locks have/had the break_lock member.
Typesafe functions would probably be preferrable, if we want to keep
break_lock for rw spin locks.

See the changes to sched.[ch].  Should apply to 23-mm1 with offsets and
minor fixup in fs/inode.c.
