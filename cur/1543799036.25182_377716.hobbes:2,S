It turns out that a lot of USB devices look for ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL for
various purposes, including flushing internal buffer-cache.  Several CF
readers do this, some "fixed" flash drives do this, etc.
Also, things like the iPod and others (and this group overlaps with the
aforementioned types of devices) give the user a visible indication that
_this_particular_ unit is ready to be removed.

The eject shouldn't flush anything from the kernel-level, but it won't
complete until the device's internal buffers are flushed.
