No obviously just using PAT for drivers wouldn't help, I was thinking more of 
having one PAT type be WB memory, and using it by default for most PTEs 
covering normal memory.  If that's not possible, then it seems sensible to 
try to fix this MTRR problem in a better way, either with something like the 
patch I posted earlier or a more advanced MTRR remapper that runs at early 
boot.  Depending on platform requirements though, that could get complicated 
pretty fast...
