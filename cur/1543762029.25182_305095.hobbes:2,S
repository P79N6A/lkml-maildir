Subject: [PATCH] - Fusion-MPT much faster as module

Here is a patch for mpt fusion drivers, which
fix's issue of poor performance when driver compiled
built-in to the kernel.
Thanks to Chen, Kenneth W.
History on this:
Between the 3.01.16 and 3.01.18, we introduced new method
to passing command line options to the driver.  Some of the
command line options are used for fine tuning dv(domain
validation) in the driver.  By accident, these command line options were
wrapped around #ifdef MODULE in the 3.01.18 version of the driver.
What this meant is when the driver is compiled built-in the kernel,
the optimal settings for dv were ignored, thus poor performance.  
There was actually a fix for this when I submitted SAS drivers
to the mailing list back in November, however the SAS drivers was
rejected, and later on I overlooked submitting a single patch to 
solve this.
Please apply this patch against the 3.01.19 version of the mpt driver
