The good thing about Linux is that, with some compile options, stuff (scalability)
can be insert and removed and any time. One shouldn't narrow their view of how an
OS can be out of a strict tradition.
I don't buy this spinlock-for-all-locking things tradition with no preemption,
especially given some of the IO performance improvement that happened as a courtesy
of preempt. Some how that was forgotten in Larry's discussion.
