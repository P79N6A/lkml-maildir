What makes you think you got that right? Do you have a
specification for the grammar? Let's look at an example
of /proc/net/dev, and I'll use my extensive /proc-parsing
experience to count your errors. Here is a sample:
Inter-|   Receive                                                |  Transmit
 face |bytes    packets errs drop fifo frame compressed multicast|bytes    packets errs drop fifo colls carrier compressed
  eth0:3077476015 33231846    0    0    0     0          0         0 101565261  774586    0    0    0     0       0          0
    lo:    1360      24    0    0    0     0          0         0     1360      24    0    0    0     0       0          0
  tap0:       0       0    0    0    0     0          0         0        0       0    0    0    0     0       0          0
  eth1:       0       0    0    0    0     0          0         0        0       0    0    0    0     0       0          0
  eth2:       0       0    0    0    0     0          0         0        0       0    0    0    0     0       0          0
Excuse me while I vomit.
Let's start with the device names. Users can change
them at will, and some driver authors aren't normal.
So, in C notation, a name could be "x1: 1 2 3\n".
It doesn't even need to that evil to screw up your
wimpy parser. A simple "av6:3" would do nicely.
Think it won't happen? Sorry, but it does and will.
This is the nature of /proc crap.
Now we get to format changes. Don't you think the
above is kind of ugly? I sure do. I'm not crazy
enough to touch the formatting, but that readable
ASCII is a temptation for many. Just look at the
history of /proc/cpuinfo, which long ago looked a
bit more like the above in terms of ':' placement.
Also, it's foolish to rely on that leading space.
Here is what my data might look like in a few years:
Iface |   Receive                                                |  Transmit

Subtle, isn't it? Your parser broke.
(then there is performance, or lack of it...)
