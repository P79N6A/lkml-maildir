Subject: [patch 0/5] enhance WARN_ON series

3rd try for this patch series; now with a split up patch for __WARN_ON
This series has the goal of extending the usefulness of the WARN_ON() information,
at least on architectures that use the generic WARN_ON() infrastructure. (Those who
do their own thing either already have the extra information, or could consider
switching to the generic code). In order to do that, WARN_ON() first needs to 
be uninlined since there's like 1200 callsites and adding code to each of those
isn't pretty.
As part of this, I had to split the __WARN_ON patch in -mm into 2 pieces, one to 
introduce __WARN_ON, and a separate one to do the ifdef cleanup.
