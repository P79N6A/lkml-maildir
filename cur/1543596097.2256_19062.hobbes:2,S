That has the same problem that AC was worried about.  Variables that
used to be treated as "undefined, don't care" are now treated as
"undefined, assume n and forbid".
As long as there is any ambiguity about how a rule is meant to treat
undefined variables, treating all undefined variables as 'n' is not
safe.  Before making a global change like this, first verify that no
rule treats undefined variables as "don't care".  Otherwise something
will break.
