I meant that when you use the "incomplete" syntax with mount (ie: no device
specified), it relies on /etc/mtab to find the mount entry you want to change.
And it's somewhat common to have /etc/mtab be a symlink to /proc/self/mounts
when you don't want /etc to be written to, because the 'mounts' entry has
nearly the same format as 'mtab' (a few missing options). Now if it was the
case, and /proc was not mounted yet, /etc/mtab would point to nowhere and mount
would have no way to find what was mounted on '/', which could lead to some
errors like this.

OK, so it doesn't come from this. Perhaps your /etc/mtab is simply broken by
some random mount option somewhere ? Also, do you use the "read-only" option
on the kernel command line ? And do your init scripts clear /etc/mtab at boot,
before the first mounts ?
