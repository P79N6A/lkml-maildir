Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.17 fix for running a SMP kernel on a UP box
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I can't seem to run a SMP 2.5.17 kernel on a UP machine, it locks up
during the boot process.  In talking to Jack Vogel, he suggested I make
the following patch, which seems to solve the problem for me.  In
looking at the code, I have no idea of why this seems to work, so there
probably is a better fix out there.
Any suggestions?
thanks,
