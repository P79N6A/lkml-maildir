Hello, Jeff.  Hello, Carlos.
I bought a sii3114 controller yesterday and took out my ST3120026AS for 
testing.  The drive times out during a WRITE_EXT, and locks up.
* The ST3120026AS works perfectly on a VIA controller.
* The sii3114 controller works perfectly with Maxtor 6B080M0 drives.
I don't know.  It acts and smells like m15w problem.  What are the odds 
of having the same symptom on the same combination?
Also, I've asked one of my friends who has a sii3512 onboard controller 
and an affected seagate drive to test.  The harddisk works on 2.6.13 
with the quirk, but it freezes on 2.6.14.  m15w affected seagate drives 
does _NOT_ work on 3512 and 3114 on 2.6.14, be it m15w or something else.
