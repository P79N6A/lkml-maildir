Actually, Ingo - there *is* one case where going through _syscallX() and
therefore int 0x80 from the kernel *is* the only way. This is when the
caller is a module. That is how I call sysfs() from BFS module. 
So, if nobody objects to allowing modules to make system calls (as we
established the corruption this morning was just my bug - so behaviour is
valid), I will send this trivial patch to Linus (exporting errno):
