Hello,
Under heavy SCSI disk load, my 2.2.10 SMB (dual P133) box is showing this
error, but it never recovers.  I haven't tried other kernels.  I am using the
standard NCR53C8XX driver, not the SYM53C8XX driver, with the default settings.
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 269291, scsi0, channel 0, id 0,
lun 0 Read (10) 00 00 2d f9 08 00 00 02 00
I would expect the driver to reset the SCSI card and recover, but it never
does, and the only thing left to do is to SysRq Boot.
Here is the relevant section of dmesg, let me know if you need more
information.  I can get this to happen by simply doing a large copy (couple
hundred megabytes) between the two disks.
