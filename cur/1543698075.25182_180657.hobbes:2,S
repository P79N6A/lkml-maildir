However, I've also tested it with my new Maxtor SATA. And I must say:
Many thanks, well done! Now, I can use 2.6.0-test under fedora with
a fine speed ~ 50MB/s in disk reads.
And with GNOME2 under 2.6.0-test11: I can compile the kernel, watch a 
movie trailer, play 2 OpenGL screensavers, download an Knoppix ISO
and the desktop has a good performance, like there is nomore running.
Cool! <

Jeff, if you ever come to Germany, Hamburg, I will invite you for a good 
drink in a fine location. :-)
Greetings,
