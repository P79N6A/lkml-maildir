This capability is built into the pxa2xx_spi driver.  
Excerpt from linux/Documentation/spi/pxa2xx:
The pxa2xx_spi driver support both DMA and interrupt driven PIO message
transfers.  The driver defaults to PIO mode and DMA transfers must
enabled by setting the "enable_dma" flag in the "pxa2xx_spi_master"
structure and and ensuring that the "pxa2xx_spi_chip.dma_burst_size"
field is non-zero.  The DMA mode support both coherent and stream based
DMA mappings.
The following logic is used to determine the type of I/O to be used on
a per "spi_transfer" basis:
if !enable_dma or dma_burst_size == 0 then
        always use PIO transfers
if spi_message.is_dma_mapped 
   and rx_dma_buf != 0 and tx_dma_buf != 0 then
        use coherent DMA mode
if rx_buf and tx_buf are aligned on 8 byte boundary then
        use streaming DMA mode
otherwise
        use PIO transfer
By enabling DMA tranfers, clearing the spi_message.is_dma_mapped and
providing transfer buffer NOT aligned on 8 byte boundary forced PIO mode
will transfer buffers aligned on 8 byte boundary forces a DMA mode.
My experiance has shown the most stack allocated transfer buffers are
not 8 byte aligned and thus use PIO mode.
