Whoops, I pasted in the wrong one, I guess, from earlier in the trace.  Here are 
the ones I was looking at:
  journal_submit_data_buffers():[fs/jbd/commit.c:242] needs writeout, adding to 
array pid 1690
      b_state:0x104005 b_jlist:BJ_SyncData cpu:0 b_count:2 b_blocknr:30045
      b_jbd:1 b_frozen_data:0000000000000000 b_committed_data:0000000000000000
      b_transaction:1 b_next_transaction:0 b_cp_transaction:0 b_trans_is_running:0
      b_trans_is_comitting:1 b_jcount:0 pg_dirty:1
and
  journal_submit_data_buffers():[fs/jbd/commit.c:242] needs writeout, adding to 
array pid 1836
      b_state:0x114005 b_jlist:BJ_SyncData cpu:1 b_count:2 b_blocknr:27130
      b_jbd:1 b_frozen_data:0000000000000000 b_committed_data:0000000000000000
      b_transaction:1 b_next_transaction:0 b_cp_transaction:0 b_trans_is_running:0
      b_trans_is_comitting:1 b_jcount:0 pg_dirty:1
