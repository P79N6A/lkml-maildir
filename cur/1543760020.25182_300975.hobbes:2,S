I've just had a look at it, and it seems possible. From what I have seen
in the firmware_class.c code, it would require:
 - registering a class somewhere in the initializaton code
 - every time a request from fbcon is generated:
   - register the class device
   - create a timer
   - call kobject_hotplug() to send the event to userspace
   - unregister the device
This requests sent to userspace are generated while switching consoles
and resetting the graphics mode. This whole create device - send the
event - remove device thing seems a little long to me. Would it be
acceptable?

The old one is already not supported. I mentioned v1 in the docs only so
that it would be clear where do the '2' in the helper's command line 
arguments come from.

I don't do now, but who knows when changes will be made to fbcon in the
future? There's a possibility that things will change enough to justify
a new splash protocol. 
On the other hand, if the hotplug way of calling userspace were to be
adopted in fbsplash, the whole splash interface with the versioning
scheme could be dropped, which, I guess, would be a good thing.

The reason for calling init in that place is the ability to use the
userspace helper to display a nice picture while the kernel is still
loading. Sure, you can just drop it and use the 'quiet' command line
option, but that will give you a black screen for a good few seconds.
And people who want eye-candy like fbsplash generally don't like that. 
I'm currently using a setup that is a combination of both the 'quiet'
option and the 'init' command. I'm using the splash helper to switch to
a selected tty and display a full-screen image, while keeping the tty 
in KD_TEXT. This looks pretty nice and lets me see the initial bitmap
for ca. 5 secs.

This is pretty nasty, right, but I just can't see a way around it. The
thing is, when the splash helper is called from the kernel, the console
semaphore is already held so we have to avoid trying to acquire it
again. And we can't just release it prior to calling the helper, as it
would break things badly.
To make sure no one uses fbsplash for malicious purposes, the
/dev/fbsplash device is used, which is kept root-writable only.

That could be arranged, but this would require a separate structure for
communicating with userspace and with in-kernel data storage (currently
both these tasks are handled with struct vc_splash), or changing
vc_splash in vc_data to a pointer to a structure. The latter option
would be better I think.

I can, but:
- there are the previously-mentioned security reasons -- the user might
  wish to make the fb device writable to some less trusted people, while
  the fbsplash device should be kept protected,
- fbsplash calls aren't really related to a particular framebuffer
  device, they are related to a tty. And we can't do ioctls on ttys when
  answering a kernel request because to the console sem problems
  (opening a tty = a call to acquire_console_sem(), which we need to
  avoid).

It's not my locking scheme, it's the scheme that is currently used in
the whole console subsystem. If someone can find a sane way to correct
the problem and avoid the whole FB_SPLASH_IO_ORIG* thing, I would be
very heppy to update fbsplash's code.

The original idea behind this was to group the fields that are common to
all fbsplash ioctl calls (ie. vc and origin) in one place. Of course,
it can be changed to three differents structs, each containing the vc
and origin fields and an int/struct vc_splash/struct fb_image, if that
is the preferred way of doing things.
Live long and prosper.
