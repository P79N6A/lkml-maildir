Ok. Its gone upstream now, but I'm happy to revert that change if it
turns out to be a problem. My tests show identical performance between
the two calls, but maybe there is a corner case I missed?
Both calls do writepage() but since the VFS has already done it for us,
the chances of there being any more dirty pages to write is fairly
small, so its unlikely to be much of a problem I think, but I'm willing
to be proved wrong if there is a good reason.

Its a tricky one to deal with. I would expect that the chances of an
application relying on an fsync on one node to cause a cross-cluster
flush is relatively unlikely. It would mean that there would have to be
another communication channel between the processes on the different
nodes through which the node that was writing data could request a flush
and then receive notification that it has finished, otherwise it would
not seem to make any sense. It would seem an odd way to write an
application, but maybe one does exist which does this somewhere.
Delving back into the history it looks like this is a change (with
respect to gfs1) made by Ken rather than myself. I don't mind adding
this feature though, but even so what we have now is still a marked
improvement on what was there previously I think,
Steve.
