Hi!
While going through the menus for configuring my new kernel the
following error occured:
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu6: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
With pure test3 this error didn't occur, but unfortunately that one
doesn't compile for me and I don't know if that errors are already
fixed.
Cheers
Udo
