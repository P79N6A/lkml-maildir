Since -rc5 is not to be found yet, I don't know what version of this
made it in. Is READA just being disabled on SMP, or was it the general
#if 0 change that got included? I'm asking since plain disabling READA
might have nasty performance effects. Andrew, I bet you did some numbers
on this, care to share?
