The power supply on this box is something upwards of 450W. Right now I 
only have four 7200rpm sata drives along with my athalon mb/cpu and a 
couple fans. I had six 7200rpm drives connected w/o raid and a P4 before 
and I had no problems. I'm pretty sure this isn't due to insufficient 
power supply.
