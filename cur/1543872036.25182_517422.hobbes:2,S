It should be. Imagine giving 20% bandwidth to a user X. X wants to
divide this bandwidth further between multi-media (10%), kernel
compilation (5%) and rest (5%). So,

Yes, the resource usage of children should be accounted when capping
parent resource usage.

Should be possible yes. That lets user X completely manage his
allocation among whatever sub-groups he creates.

The patches should give visibility to both nsproxy objects (by showing
what tasks share the same nsproxy objects and letting tasks move across
nsproxy objects if allowed) and the resource control objects pointed to
by nsproxy (struct cpuset, struct cpu_limit, struct rss_limit etc).
