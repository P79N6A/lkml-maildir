I do agree. EMBEDDED largely means "non-generic/non-standard" these days. 
It's also true that EMBEDDED does *not* necessarily mean "small", since 
some of the choices that it disables can often be choices that you want on 
*big* machines.
For example, the whole thing where VGA and keyboard/mouse support default 
to on when EMBEDDED isn't selected is quite possibly a good reason to 
enable EMBEDDED on big servers that aren't even meant to be general- 
purpose, but simply optimized for a particular environment.
That is, technically, what "embedded" really means. A lot of the time 
people talk about it as if it was always "small", but it can be a big 
computer that is just used in a very specific turn-key environment where 
some of the default kernel choices may not be sensible.
