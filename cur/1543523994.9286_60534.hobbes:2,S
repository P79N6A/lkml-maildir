Hi there,
following a 2.2.14 crash on one of our test webcache server (running squid
to test raid-0.90-19990824 stability), I compiled a new kernel:
- 2.2.15pre5
- raid-0.90-19990824 for 2.2.11 (I had to backout the diff to raid0.c in 2.2.13 -> 2.2.14
patch).
- reiserfs 3.5.16 for 2.2.14
After reboot and launching squid, kernel msg scrolled continuously on my pty:
'gfp called by non-running (1) task from da49e960!'
(~ 20 per second)
stopping squid stop also the messages.
At first I thought it could be either raid-0.90 or reiserfs related, so I've
reformated squid spooling area to a plain ext2fs on a normal partition (no raid)
but the get_free_pages msg keep scrolling at high rate when I start squid.
My squid is compiled with threads support, allowing squid disk i/o to be
scheduled outside the main select loop of squid.
Lot's of squid thread are sitting idle, waiting for the main squid
to dispatch it's disk i/o.
Context: PII 450 512MB SDRAM, Compaq proliant 1850R, Debian 2.1r4,
kernel and squid compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3 (part of debian).
2 other such server running vanilla 2.2.14 and the same squid
without a glitch.
