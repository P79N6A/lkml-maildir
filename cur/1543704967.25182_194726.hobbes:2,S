Err, well there are always the server and embedded markets, if the
device was cheap enough.

WHAT!?  You are making the project out to be several orders of
magnitude more difficult and expensive than it is.
Did you know that you can generate a 625-line TV signal with little
more hardware than a Z80 CPU?  Some 8-bits actually did that.

Quite a few.  Think of the TV-connected embedded appliance market, for
example.  Displaying a static menu of choices isn't exactly very
demanding.
