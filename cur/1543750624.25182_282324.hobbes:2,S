Hello,
 On Internet i found one document that states
following statement "Linux chooses to use linear
buffers and save space in advance because linear
buffers make many other things much faster."
I want to know what is linear buffers? are they
different than what we declare in normal C programming
syntax unsigned char *str.
regards,
linux_lover
