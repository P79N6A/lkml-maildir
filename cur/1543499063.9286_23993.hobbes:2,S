  Hi, all. Version 111 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.3.6. Highlights of this release:
- Created separate event queue for each mounted devfs
- Removed <devfs_invalidate_dcache>
- Created new ioctl()s for devfsd
- Incremented devfsd protocol revision to 3
- Fixed bug when re-creating directories: contents were lost
- Block access to inodes until devfsd updates permissions
				Regards,
					Richard....
