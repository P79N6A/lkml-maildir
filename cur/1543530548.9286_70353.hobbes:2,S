The BIOS doesn't have specific setting for power in regards to USB. I'm
not sure what you mean. In general, the BIOS is set to spin down the disk
after 5 min, reduce the clock speed automatically, etc.
What IRQ should USB be using? Since it is on the PCI bus, shouldn't it use
IRQ 9 (shared)?
Here is a what the interrupts look like. There isn't any big difference
when I insert the usb-uhci module:
[root@tool /root]# while : ; do cat /proc/interrupts|grep eth0; sleep 2
; done;
