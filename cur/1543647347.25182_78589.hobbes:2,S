Ah, is that how you do it?  (Where were you eight months ago? :)
The bigger problem is that the sucker belongs in the SCSI menu, not in the top
level menu, so something more like...  (Patch against 2.4.19)

The above "Works for me."  Not that I have a fusion MPT controller, but the config

controller, so life is good...
