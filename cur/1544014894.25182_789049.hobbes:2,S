You make me realize that I have never encountered an usb-acm device yet.
I did not even know what they were supposed to be :-/

Since it's probably the first time I read a report about usb-acm, I think
that this driver is very rarely used. So it may simply be broken or full
of race conditions or improper locking.
What you could do :
  - try without SMP if you're on an SMP machine.
  - try with an old gcc (2.95.3 is perfect for 2.4, 3.3 is good too).
Adding support for gcc 3.4 a few years ago was not easy, and it is
possible that some drivers are still not properly fixed.
Also, do you remember the latest 2.4 kernel where this driver worked
correctly (if any at all) ?
