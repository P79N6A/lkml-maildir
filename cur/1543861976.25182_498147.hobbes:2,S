Apparently here: drivers/base/core.c:
void device_del(struct device * dev)
{
	struct device * parent = dev->parent;
	struct class_interface *class_intf;
	if (parent)
		klist_del(&dev->knode_parent);
The obvious change with this device is that usb_set_configuration() is never
called, but that should not matter.
