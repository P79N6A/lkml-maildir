Most programmers (and thus programs) expect this to be a compile time 
decision.
What are the reasons of allowing to change it so dynamic at all?
What are the security implications of this?
My naive guess is, that it might defeat range checking of values 
in user space code.
What about limiting this to be called once per task or VM?
This will prevent most abuse scenarios, I can think of.
