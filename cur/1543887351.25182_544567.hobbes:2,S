Not a bad idea. When using the US_FL_IGNORE_DEVICE flag, that causes the
usb-storage driver to no load the device and allow another driver
properly load it? The reason I ask is because I previously had a
separate driver for the device, however there were priority issues
regarding which loaded first usb-storage or the separate driver.
Thanks,

We have to do a similar thing for some zd1211rw USB-wireless devices,
which appear as a virtual CDROM drive on plugin. To convert them to a
proper wireless device, the cdrom has to be ejected, then the device
disconnects and reconnects with different ID's (and the wireless
endpoints).
Originally I wrote a usb-storage subdriver to handle the auto-eject, but
this was rejected. It was decided to make usb-storage simply ignore the
devices, and have the zd1211rw driver do the eject operation. The same
may also apply in your case. See the US_FL_IGNORE_DEVICE flag, and the
DEVICE_INSTALLER handling in drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/zd_usb.c
