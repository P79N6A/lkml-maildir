Scary. This also happened to me. I'm running 2.2.8 and I was untarring
the 2.3.2 sources and I ran out of disk space. Then the tar froze. I
then tried deleting another file off of the same parition and it hung.
kflushd, update and rm all froze in __wait_on_super, some zsh shells I
was trying to exit froze in __down_failed and the tar froze in
wakeup_bdflush.
There is definately a race condition somewhere in there.
update was running, and I assume from this post and others that it is
bad to have update running? It seems to make to difference looking at
this post.
I WAS able to read off of that parition at the time, just anything
trying to write would freeze. Atleast reading some man pages worked for
me :)
My machine is a K6-2/300 w/ 128megs of RAM, Adaptec 2940, partition was
on a SCSI disk. Although I've been hacking USB alot recently, it was NOT
loaded at the time. My machine also had APM compiled/enabled.
