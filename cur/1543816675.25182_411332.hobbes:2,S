What do you mean by "support", exactly?
There are 3 different bits of xattr design which matter here.  There's
the namespace exported to users via the *attr syscalls; there's the
encoding used on disk for those different namespaces; and there's the
exact semantics surrounding interpretation of the xattr contents.
Now, a non-Hurd system is not going to have any use for the gnu.* xattr
semantics, as translator is a Hurd-specific concept.  The user "gnu.*"
namespace is easy enough to teach to Linux: to simply reserve that
namespace, without actually implementing any part of it, I think it be
sufficient simply to claim the name in include/linux/xattr.h.
For ext2/3, though, the key is how to store gnu.* on disk.  Right now
the different namespaces that ext* stores on disk are enumerated in
	fs/ext[23]/xattr.h
which, for ext2, currently contains:
        /* Name indexes */
        /* Name indexes */
        #define EXT2_XATTR_INDEX_USER			1
        #define EXT2_XATTR_INDEX_POSIX_ACL_ACCESS	2
        #define EXT2_XATTR_INDEX_POSIX_ACL_DEFAULT	3
        #define EXT2_XATTR_INDEX_TRUSTED		4
        #define	EXT2_XATTR_INDEX_LUSTRE			5
        #define EXT2_XATTR_INDEX_SECURITY	        6
If you want to reserve a new semantically-significant portion of the
namespace for use in the Hurd by gnu.* xattrs, then you'd need to submit
an authoritative Linux patch to register a new name index on ext2;
reservation of such an xattr namespace index is in effect an on-disk
format decision so needs to be agreed between implementations.

Certainly; I don't think anybody is arguing against that, and I regard
such backwards compatibility as an absolute requirement.
