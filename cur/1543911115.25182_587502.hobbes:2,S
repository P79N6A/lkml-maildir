Against the tip of the kernel + kgdb patches this config builds.  I 
wonder if is the compiler or the macros for atomic_read or cmpxchg have 
changed for in the -mm tree.  Perhaps it is not relevant though if you 
read on.

It was available for all the archs that the kgdb had been implemented on 
at the time.

Perhaps yes, perhaps no I guess it depends on what actually gets 
generated...  In the past the intent of this was to guard for the race 
to be the master processor and looked like some attempt to do it 
atomically.  This code had been in use for a number of years at this point.

Perhaps there is a cleaner way to do the same thing and avoid the 
cmpxchg all together.  I used the attached patch to eliminate the 
cmpxchg operation.
