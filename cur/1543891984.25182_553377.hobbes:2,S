Like I said, I would prefer NIL of if absolutely need be NIL_PTR. NULL is a 
pointer that doesn't point anywhere valid -- NIL is a pointer that points to a 
zero sized object.
If I'd have a few small children around I'd show them the word ZERO_SIZE_PTR and 
make pictures of them bursting out in tears.
