For the features that don't exist in Linux yet, you want to look closely
at Plan 9 From Bell Labs, whence UTF-8 originates. Plan 9 for example has
font cacheing in the kernel for huge glyph sets, if I read it right. The
Plan 9 C compiler, written by Ken Thompson, author of UNIX and ed,
specifically for writing Plan 9, is fully UTF-8 also. Everything else in
Plan 9 is also UTF-8, from ed to libc to the GUI.
Per-process namespaces are a Plan 9 idea also. That is the ultimate in
localization. Plan 9 was released relatively recently under a license
clearly patterned after the GPL. Congratulations once again to Richard
Stallman. Thompson, Ritchie, Pike and so on have embraced his most
important ideas. 
Plan 9 has a narrow platform base compared to Linux or NetBSD. I myself
haven't been able to install it on my oldish hardware. You probably need
to see it running, I suspect. 
My own Dotted Standard File Hierarchy mechanism in cLIeNUX
(Linux/GNU/unix) may also be of interest. See my "/" below. That could
easily be Japanese, Mandarin, Hindi, etc.
