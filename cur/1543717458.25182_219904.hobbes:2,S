Any patches applied against the current vanilla kernel.org kernel would
be listed in .patches.  This would include vendor, third-party, and even
pre/bk/mm patches.  
Keep in mind, .patches would not contain the entire patch, as that would
be WAY to large, but just a short entry such as the name, date last
modified, and date applied of the patch file.

Exactly as I stated, adoption would be the hardest part.  Paul's idea of
adding an option to patch w/o breaking POSIX sounds like a way to go. 
Of course that would require widespread documentation updates and
contacting vendors but would be very possible.

No need to be sorry, thanks!  :)
