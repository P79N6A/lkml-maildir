Subject: Race condition in 2.2.12 buffers?

This is what I get on a 2.2.12 system with 3 UW-SCSI disks using a Symbios
875 and running plain disk-striping (old md, not new 0.90 code) across
two devices:
/dev/md0        raid0,4k,0,d143a62f     /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 
/dev/md1        raid0,1024k,0,64861e07  /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdc3 
The kernel seems to hang solid after running for about 48 hours under
heavy disk IO (it's a newsserver) with the following clue left in the
syslog (surprisingly, this was flushed out to disk cleanly; the log
partition is not on either of the md devices, it's on /dev/sda6):
Aug 31 12:08:48 kernel: Whoops: end_buffer_io_async: b_count != 1 on async io. 
The machine did not react to keyboard or to network traffic anymore.
The latest log entry present on disk appeared about 46 seconds after this
bcount error.
