I made a quick test with the ac3 encoder aften, I tested against rsdl 0.36 (I 
think it was). Time was slightly worse: >5.9 secs (with two threads on 
Athlon64 X2 x86_64). mainline gives me 5.4sec. rsdl took 5.8 sec.
I haven't testes earlier cfs nor later sd. Seems scheduler gets optimized more 
for single core than smp?
