Laws don't get changed by people moving, they get changed working to get
them changed.

I agree with that, I wouldn't want to see this happen either.

I would gladly publish them on my site, however, I'm unsure how I could get
them, and I unfortunately don't have the skill to completely understand them
from only the source.  If someone can help me with this I'll be glad to
provide the space.
Also, shouldn't some company with Linux interest be willing to take on this
risk?  Say, Redhat or IBM.
Later,
Tom
