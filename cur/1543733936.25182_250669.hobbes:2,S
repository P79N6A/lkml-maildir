I rest assured that nothing I've written thus far will apply to or be
included in any of it, as a matter of course (nothing specific to you).

This may be; I'll leave that decision to you as the interface designer.

I took the structure fields to be just an argument passing convention
giving the nommu case an identical prototype much like the helpers in
fs/proc/task_{no,}mmu.c. Using different field names and etc. is also
feasible, of course. I'll wait for your updates to follow up further.
