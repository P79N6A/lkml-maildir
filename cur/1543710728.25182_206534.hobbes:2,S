Subject: [PATCH] Do not include linux/irq.h from linux/netpoll.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
(I hope netdev is the right place for netpoll stuff)
It seems that the changeset at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/cset/cset-jgarzik@redhat.com
|ChangeSet|20040302073919|27676.txt breaks the current BK tree build for ARM.
The culprit would appear to be the addition of a 
	#include <linux/netpoll.h>
to net/core/dev.c which in turn pulls in <linux/irq.h> which (as Russell
King notes in a comment therein) should not be included from generic
code.
>From what I can tell from the netpoll code used to call the drivers irq
handler to simulate a poll but now it uses the poll_controller function,
therefore I don't think the linux/irq.h needs to be included any longer.
The patch below removes the include.
I successfully built an ARM kernel with NETCONSOLE and NETPOLL enabled,
although I was not able to test it since my network driver has no poll
method.
Cheers,
Ian.
