After the patch is applied, the kernel finishes initializing the IDE
chipset and then hangs; every so often the message "hda: lost interrupt"
gets printed. For the record, the controller here is an ALI 1543.
On another note, I'm not subscribed to linux-kernel; I read it through
one of the web archives. Is there any resource I can use that will avoid
HTML-mangling the patches that are posted? It's getting really annoying
having to manually clean up posted code.
Thanks,
