Ok, the reason for this one is that we don't really emulate a
trap/interrupt gate correctly when taking a lcall. We _do_ set up the 
stack to be identical, but a real trap/interrupt will also clear TF and NT 
in EFLAGS on entry to the kernel (_after_ having saved the value off), and 
our emulation code didn't do that.
So when we returned with an "iret", we had NT set in EFLAGS, causing the
iret to do all the wrong things.
This is my 2.5.x fix, I suspect it applies as-is to 2.4.x too. I don't 
think anything has changed here in a long time. 
Does anybody see anything else we're missing from the emulation path? 
(Or path_s_, as I noticed after fixing the bug once already ;^p. We should
probably try to do this all as common code rather than having two separate
paths for lcall 0x7 and lcall 0x27 - the code is identical apart from one
little constant.. This looks like the minimal patch, though.)
