   State of your system - on/off. Power saving as done by user herself: 
power is consumed only when user want to boil the water ;-)
   Two devices I was working on were little bit more complicated and I 
had internal UPS to be able to handle power offs/fails gracefuly (like 
switching off of LCD + save of the mechanics state).
   As for me - I already expressed my point on subject: we should fix 
compiler and language (C's inline is definitely not ehough to express 
our intentions to compiler). That's the compiler should be optimized to 
gain space for performace or gain performance for space.
   And sure kernel should be more configurable too.
