Yeah, the problem is that laptops don't implement _SUN, which is used
for the slot numbering by the existing acpiphp code.  So the slot number
will read -1 if _SUN is missing.  I'm not sure if 0 is a valid slot
number, and I wasn't sure if that would make sense either.  I think that
I'm going to have to provide a separate user space interface to the dock
anyway, since we now know that it's possible to have a dock station that
has no pci slots at all.
