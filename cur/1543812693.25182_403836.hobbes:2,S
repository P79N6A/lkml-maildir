I like it.  If we run top we wind of with the same number of dynamic
allocations, with task_refs (because /proc uses them).  The amount of
memory utilized is lower.  Probes for unused sessions and process
groups are a little more expensive but not noticeably so.
Unless we can implement do_each_task_pid/while_each_task_pid in terms
of for_each_task_pid.  I am nervous about making the conversion.
During fork is a very nice time to allocate these as it allows the
rest of the code to assume they are always available.
I think we had something similar several years ago, that's where
the name struct pid came from.  But it used a separate head for each
type of pid, and it used a separate structure for what we now embed
in struct task.
It completely breaks my patch for multiple pid spaces. Oh well it
isn't merged anyway. :)

I will take a good hard look at it once I send off my patchs to shore
up task_refs in the -mm tree.
