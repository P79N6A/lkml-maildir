Hi, Li-san
Thanks for your framework. It's one of patches what I really want.
My test machine has SATA controller and works with ata_piix driver with no
.suspend and .resume entry while ide.c has them.
The first thing I did is to create them and add some function calls to save
and restore the device specific PCI configuration space.
But then I had no idea how to execute ACPI's IDE specific method like _GTM,
_STM.
As I am not familiar with IDE driver too, I hope the module owner will
change ata_piix source to support .suspend, .resume, .platform_bind entries
soon.
Regards, Hiro.
