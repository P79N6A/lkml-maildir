	The smbfs file system with linux 2.1.70 and higher (that includes
2.2.x) requires the smbmount program from Samba.  The smbmount program
from Samba 1.9.x package will not compile on RedHat 5.x and I'm not
supporting ANY bug reports from that version.  Other people have announced
patches to get smbmount from 1.9.x to work on RedHat, but none are supported
and none are going into the 1.9.x source tree, so you pays your nickel and
you takes your chance there.  1.9.x Samba development is totally frozen out
with the Samba 2.0 release.
	Get the samba 2.0 package from www.samba.org and recompile Samba.
When you run configure add the --with-smbmount option.  That will then
generate three programs, smbmount, smbmnt, and smbumount.  Install them
(or install the whole blinken Samba package - it's a good'n).  Installing
on RedHat, there are a couple of patches in the packaging/RedHat that you
might want to apply.
	Here is the order I do things:
	# cd /usr/src
	# tar xvzf samba-2.0.0.tar.gz
	# cd samba/source
	# patch -p2 < ../packaging/RedHat/makefile-path.patch
	# patch -p2 < ../packaging/RedHat/smbw.patch
	# ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-smbmount
	# make
	# make install
	Should give you everything you need.
	NOTE:  The smbmount program syntax has changed!  The old syntax
no longer works.  It's currently on my todo list to work out a compatibilty
mode for the syntax and to get smbmount to cooperate with autofs.  There
are currently OTHER problems with autofs that are higher priority (such as
a $#@$#@ deadly embrace that I'm trying to sort out).
