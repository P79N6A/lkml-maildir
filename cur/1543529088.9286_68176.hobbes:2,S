Hi guys,
I don't know if the original SGI version of kdb has moved further ahead or
not (I didn't follow their developments closely) but I just needed kdb
tonight so I ported the version I was using up to the today's 2.3.50 and
of course would like to share the result with you:

Applies cleanly to 2.3.50 (and even works!)
Regards,
Tigran.
