Hi!
I just brought two D-Link DGE-528T (uses r8159 driver) network adapters
to have nice 1 Gbps home network between two computers.
I have gigabit crossover cable that is connected like this
Pin  Connector #1  Connector #2
1    white/orange  white/green
2    orange        green
3    white/green   white/orange
4    blue          white/brown
5    white/blue    brown
6    green         orange
7    white/brown   blue
8    brown         white/blue
(from: 
http://logout.sh/computers/net/gigabit/
)
and when I use this cable I only get 10 Mbps connection when connected
another D-Link DGE-528T.
However if I connect other end of cable to Intel EtherExpress 100 Mbps
card, I get 100 Mbps connection auto-negotiated OK.
I can however force gigabit link on both D-Link DGE-528T using
	insmod ./r8169.ko media=0x10
command. And I get about 15 MiB/s transfer speed when testing
with netcat and pmr[1] (without NAPI). Which I count as some kind of
sucky gigabit connection.
Few questions for you:
Do anyone know if there some known bug in auto-negotiation with
Realtek 8159 chip? (Or is that just wrong cable?)
Can I force 1000 Mbps link on some other way than giving option to
insmod? Using /proc or something?
What kind of transfer speed you have reached with these cards? That
15 MiB/s is not what I expected.
Thanks!
Best regards,
Petri Koistinen

Test setup:
Server: nc -l -p 2000 </dev/zero
Client: nc 192.168.1.1 2000 | pmr >/dev/null
pmr (ex. pipemeter) is a command line filter that measures
bandwidth going through the pipe:
