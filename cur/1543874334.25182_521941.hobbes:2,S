For pte pages (which are far more common), more than a single cacheline
will be in cache.
Yes, a common quicklist implementation is good.  But no quicklist
implementation at all is better.  You say that will be slower, and you may
well be right, but I say let's demonstrate that (please) rather than
speculating.
Then we can look at the difference and decide whether it is worth the
additional complexity of this special-purpose private allocator.

I believe that work predated per-cpu-pages.

It has a lot to do with this patch.
If we decide that it is useful to optimise the full-mm teardown case then
we will need to zero these pages when we start to use them so we might as
well get them straight from the page allocator.  Hence this patch goes into
the bitbucket.

It is not pie-in-the-sky to ask "is this code still useful?".
