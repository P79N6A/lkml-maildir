is there any fix for that? Loading 14 jack_test clients only uses up
~33% of CPU time on my testbox. Or should it be possible for me to
trigger xruns using so many clients and 33% CPU utilization already? 
Could you perhaps try 14 instances of jack_test on your box, and see
whether you can generate similar xruns as you could generate with
fluidsynth? jack_test should certainly exclude as much jack-client side
complexity as possible.
