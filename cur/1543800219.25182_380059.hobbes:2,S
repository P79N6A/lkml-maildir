Dear Kernel mailers,
I have specific requirement of building kernel 2.6.11.12 with gcc- 3.3 over the FC4 dist. 
I have downloaded the gcc-3.3.
As FC4 comes with a default gcc-4.0, how do I set the kernel Makefile to use the gcc-3.3 instead of gcc-4.0.
How do I achieve it? I know it is a very small issue and searched google and I am unable to find it.
Please help.
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
