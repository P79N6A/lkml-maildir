should probably be in here - can you add something of the form "Setting this
too high can cause vmalloc failures, especially on smaller-RAM machines",
and/or *say* how much RAM the default takes?  Sure, it's 1M entries, but
my tuning on a 2G-RAM machine will differ if these are byte-sized, or 128-byte
sized - one is off in a corner, the other is 1/16th of my entire memory.
Also, would it be useful to *lower* the value drastically, if you know a priori
that no process should get up to 1K file handles, much less 1M? Does that
buy me anything different than setting RLIMIT_NOFILE=1024?
