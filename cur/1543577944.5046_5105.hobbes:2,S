Yes, I was thinking i_blocks, but you are correct - I wasn't accounting for
the indirect blocks.  This limit is still {2,4,8,16} times smaller than the
limit you were calculating for i_size.  If we do the i_blocks limit checking
at block allocation time (for large sparse files) this is even better, but
so far it wasn't done...
Cheers, Andreas
