Ok. I applied this patch. What I experience is this:
meminfo Before test:

I see the cache grow slowly but constantly during file-copy. I stopped the test, when the first errors occured from NFS at client side (cp: /backup/Aug/day_18_10.gz: Stale NFS file handle). Interestingly the errors came up, when all physical memory was eaten up by the cache, the free section was very low, but no swapping occured (swap _is_ turned on).
I could copy 766389 kB in total which looks roughly like cached-value. I guess there is simply no release done. Does the aging algorithm really work (as expected)?
