flags are atomic as they are a machine word.  So they do not
require a read/modify write so they will either be written
or not written.  Plus this allows write-sharing of the appropriate
cache line which is very polite (assuming the line is not shared with
something else)
I do need a big fat comment about this though.
There is serialization as there is only one process that can write
to this value from exactly one spot.

Agreed.  I need to change the name to something like state and stop doing
bit tests.  To make this clear.

Yes. I may need a memory barrier in there.  I need to think
about that a little more.

Well the only bad thing that can happen is that I get a process that
can run and observe pid == 1 has exited.  So Bang!! is not too
painful.
For an initial implementation that is not yet ready for kernel
inclusion, and was posted to show the form I expect my patches
to take that wasn't too bad.

So the SIGKILL is not about pspace clean up so much as making it
impossible to observe a state where pid == 1 is not running.

Yes references counts can work, and do so regularly in the kernel.
Work queues will put you in a process context trivially, so being
dropping the last ref from an irq handler and then needed process
context to do the cleanup is not a problem.

Does not follow.
Kirill you are not making all of your reasoning explicit and making
mistakes in the gaps.
The steps you are making seem to be.
containers are simpler.
simpler means easier to get correct.
bugs will happen.
therefore you will use the simpler solution.
The above reasoning seems to assume that containers are not prone
to the same reference counting bugs as namespaces.  Given that
we are solving the same problem in similar problems this seems 
unwarranted.
In addition the rejection of the basic container approach is largely
based upon lack of flexibility.  No amount of additional simplicity
can make up for not meeting real world requirements. 
Kirill there may be a case where your container concept performs
beautifully and simplifies the problem, but I have looked and I
have not seen it.
