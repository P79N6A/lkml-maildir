Hi Micha,
(1) Ugly split-include frotz showing up on the screen
I have a patch for this.  After 2.2.0, I will get it out and put it
up for testing.  It's more than ugly; it will actually be a bit nicer
and cleaner to do this at the beginning of 'vmlinux' rather than at
the end of configuration (the four copies of the code become one,
and the 'if' test goes away).

I don't understand you -- please be more specific.  What exactly are
you seeing?
