This transname hack was not NFS specific!
it allowed to have name suffixes like "name#HOST=term2#".
When you tried to open the file "name" and your hostname is "term2" you will
succeed in spite of a file "name" nmot existing: you will open
"name#HOST=term2#"
I've setup a pool of X-Terminals using this patch, so feel free to ask for
more details. (But I have to recheck.) I can provide a diff against 2.0.36.
But maybe the developers of the patch (Stuttgart) have ported it to 2.2, I
don't know.
