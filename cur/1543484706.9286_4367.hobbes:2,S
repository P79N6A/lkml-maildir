Hi Richard,
	I agree with you completely, the cpu detection sequence should be
completely overhauled for 2.3.  I think that it should happen at a much
earlier point.  Doing so would avoid the dodgy_tsc hack below, and the
recalibration of bogomips.  I think the main problem for not doing so has
to do with SMP setup.  If given a chance I would put the cpu detection
right after the printk(linux_banner)  ;-)

There shouldn't be any TSC cap. flag to be cleared anyways, on a 686.
Your cpuinfo is correct for a 686 clasic, only the fpu flag should be
there (and it is!).
Now the dodge_tsc *is* an ugly hack without a simple soln.  IIRC, the
problem is that MediaGX reports a TSC that is not there (so it crashes and
burns), but since setup_time(), et al.  code runs before the cpu is
properly identified, it assumes that the capabilities read in head.S are
correct!  Still calling the same setup routine twice is a dirty hack in my
book.  You can argue that this is Cyrix fault, but in the end people still
want to use their chips with Linux.

What extra-capabilites are you talking about?  What cpuid returns is all
there is.
The convoluted part of check_cx*() is my bad.  The cosmetic fix is simple
though, do the calls to the check_cx*()  functions from within
cyrix_model().  At the time I was just trying to be consistent with the
rest of the bugs.h code.
Anyways, check_cx686_cpuid() checks that the processor is actually a
686(L,MX,MII) so it *will* read the right capabilities.  The problem is
that some braindead motherboard BIOS disable the cpuid inst. on Cyrixes
686MX & MII's, plus the 686(L)  have it off by default.  So this hack is a
must have.

Yep it is convoluted.  It is a myriad of undocumented interactions that
somehow make it work right, and it is extremely fragile...
