ACK, and thanks.  Regression against 2.6.23...
I should have searched for other device_for_each_child() calls
when I had to do the same thing to fix the mmc_spi breakage.
Looks like the pxa2xx_spi suspend() code probably broke too.
I CC'd the maintainer of that code, though I'm not sure how
much time he has for this lately.
I'll hope someone else checks for non-SPI driver stacks which
such "class_dev" elimination may have broke...
