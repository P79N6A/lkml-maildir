I have for several month now had my kernel randomly freeze on me
without me getting anything in the log files. The other day I let the
machine stay in virtual console 1 (ascii mode) and let X run on
virtual console 7 (vc7). The machine still crashed, but I got the
kernel death cry. Here goes (after running it through ksymoops):

aiee, killing interrupt handler
kernel panic: attempted to kill the idle task!
in swapper task - not syncing
1737 warnings and 5 errors issued.  Results may not be reliable.
Looking at the trace, I can see the cpu wasn't actually doing
anything when it crashed. Well, an interrupt occured, and that
apparently is fatal on my machine. Now I wonder why. There is not much 
to go on with, except debugging the interrupt handler, which I an NOT
qualified to do.
Out of interrest, I looked at /proc/interrupts:
           CPU0

Should I be worried about the nvidia driver/hardware sharing
interrupts with the USB port? That's apparently the only problem I can 
see, but I have earlier had USB be shared with eth0 and the system
still crashed, though not that often. The NIC generates less
interrupts than the graphics card.
This is my general hardware setup:
AMD Athlon 500
Microstart 6167 motherboard (RedHat kernel 2.2.16-22)
Nvidia TNT2 (now GeForce2MX) (XFree86-4.0.1-1 with nvidia drivers)
Yamaha YMF724 (oss drivers)
3com 3c905b (now RealTek 8139) (3c59x/3c90x or rtl8139 drivers)
ISA scsi card (sym53c416, drivers not loaded).

USB drivers was using irq 9. USB is now disabled. The log above was
with USB enabled, though.

USB would be listed here as the AMD usb interface (taken from /etc/sysconfig/hwconf):
"Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]|AMD-756 [Viper] USB"
I have had USB be shared with eth0 and nvidia, both leading to
freezes. I guess the kernel death cry would be that same as the one I
losted in this mail.
I realise that I am not using a standard kernel, and that you might
not use my bug report because of that, but I don't think RedHat would
change the interrupt handling of the kernel. They would rather add
features (such as USB support and AGP driver support). Anyway, I have
tried a standard kernel (2.2.16) with no success. Apparently interrupt
sharing is not stable with my chipset.
I hope I have given enough information to aid the debugging. If not,
please email me (as I am not a subscriber to this list).

Bernhard Ege
