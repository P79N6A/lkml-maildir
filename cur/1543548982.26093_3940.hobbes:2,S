The problem was that the kernel was overwriting a userspace buffer, used
to copy the data to. I can have a look at the code to see if it is really
fixed.
It seems really fixed, even dd likes the new sitation.. It always
segfaulted with the old kernel.

Both kernels are VERY OLD. 2.3.5 is ancient, 2.2.14 is also. Upgrading
should be done anyway due to security bugs present in < 2.2.16

I'll have a look at the code these days..
