I think it would be better to do the latter, add another mode for 
simple keyed digest processing (KMAC?), where a function called something 
like kmac_init() takes the tfm/key/kelen paramters.  The kmac_update() and
kmac_final() methods are just wrappers around the digest methods, and we 
also kmac_kmac() similar to the HMAC method.
This would be a config option.

Is there an 802.11i spec available?  It seems like there are only drafts 
available which require payment.  I'd like to see the Micheal MIC 
algorithm description & know of any potential IP rights issues.
Also, is there any mainline kernel code which would use this feature?
