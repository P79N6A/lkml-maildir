Hi,
I just found the following strange messages in the syslog:
  Aug  8 22:43:48 arthur kernel: NET: 4 messages suppressed.
  Aug  8 22:43:48 arthur kernel: Remind Kuznetsov, he has to repair gtalk eventually
  Aug  8 22:43:52 arthur kernel: NET: 3 messages suppressed.
  Aug  8 22:43:52 arthur kernel: Remind Kuznetsov, he has to repair gtalk eventually
What's this all about? I started gtalk (GNOME talk) by accident, but I
didn't expect to see this kind of kernel messages in the syslog. It's
a funny kind of assert(), though ;-). I'm currently running
linux-2.4.0-test6/pre5.
Erik
