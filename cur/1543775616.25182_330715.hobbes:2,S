Hello,
I wanted to activate my old dust-covered IOmega ZIP-Drive 100MB (PPA),
but didn´t get it working (see dmesg-extract). Sadly, google could not
help me in my case.
Therefore my decision to ask the good people at this newsgroup  :-)
---dmesg---
pnp: Device 00:0a activated.
parport: PnPBIOS parport detected.
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7, dma 3
[PCSPP,TRISTATE,COMPAT,ECP,DMA]
SCSI subsystem initialized
ppa: Version 2.07 (for Linux 2.4.x)
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use EPP 32 bit
ppa: Found device at ID 6, Attempting to use PS/2
ppa: Communication established with ID 6 using PS/2
scsi0 : Iomega VPI0 (ppa) interface
scsi: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery: host 0 channel 0
id 6 lun 0
---lsmod---
Module                  Size  Used by
parport_pc             41540  0
ppa                    12808  0
scsi_mod              137672  1 ppa
parport                37448  2 parport_pc,ppa
Things I´ve already tried:
- BIOS Settings switched to SPP, EPP, ECP, ECP/EPP
- Reconnected the cabling
- Rebooted with ZIP-Drive a) connected and powered b) disconnected
- Loaded modules with both disk inserted and ejected
- Tried kernel-settings CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_EPP16 and
  CONFIG_SCSI_IZIP_SLOW_CTR
Other Information:
- Mainboard: VIA Apollo CLE266 (EPIA M10000 with VIA C3 1GHz CPU)
- Drive works with Windows 2000 on the same machine
- No printer connected to the ZIP-Drive
- Linux second 2.6.12.2 #3 Sat Jul 2 20:51:04 CEST 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
Surely there is someone out there knowing a hint or solution? At least
I´m hoping so.
Thanks in advance - Sebastian
