Hi,
In the bad days of devfsd, no user program could remove /dev/stderr
(bacause fs didn't allow for that).
But I switched to udev sometime ago.
Today I discovered that my mysqld was happily unlinking it and
recreating as regular file in /dev (I pass --log=/dev/stderr
to mysqld).
Can I make /dev/stderr non-unlink-able?
