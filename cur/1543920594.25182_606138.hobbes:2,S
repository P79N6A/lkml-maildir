Hi Linus,
Please pull from:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git for_linus
It has a number random cleanups and bug fixes, and two new features.
The first is uninitialized block groups, which allows fast mke2fs
operations plus as well as speeding up e2fsck by allowing it to skip
parts of the inode tables that haven't been used yet.  A checksum has
been added to block group descriptors so we can tell detect corruption
in that data structure, since we are depending on it being accurate so
we know what portion of the inode table is really in use.
The second feature is flexible block groups, which allows inode tables
and block/inode bitmaps to be grouped together outside of the block
group that they administer, to allow contiguous regions of data blocks
to span multiple block groups, which helps for large files significantly
bigger than the size of a block group (i.e., 32 gigabytes on a 4k block
filesystem).
All of these patches have been baking in -mm for a while.
Regards,
							- Ted
