After digging some more, I finally managed to get my hands back on it:

This isn't "randomly hitting ISA ports", this is reading the base I/O
addresses from LPC configuration space. That's much better than letting
the user set the addresses using module parameters.
Lennart, can you please provide the output of the following commands on
your system?
isadump 0x2e 0x2f 5
isadump 0x2e 0x2f 6
isadump 0x4e 0x4f 5
isadump 0x4e 0x4f 6
(isadump is part of the lm_sensors package.)
