I rewrote the title to
	kexec: add dmesg log symbols to /proc/vmcoreinfo lists
it's nice to identify which subsystem is responsible for a patch.
I also did all the below.  Please check it.  (Is anyone else reading all
this stuff??)
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
- switch didnt-need-to-be-a-macro to inline
- Remove unneeded ifdefs (we already did that in the header)
- repair bouncy enter key
