What chunks?

And is fine with 16MB anyways I think.

That is the only case where there are rumours they are not fine with 16MB.

b44 is 30bit. That's true. I even got one here.
But it doesn't count really because we can handle it fine with existing 
16MB GFP_DMA

That one only needs one page or so. In the worst case memory could be preallocated
in .bss for it.
