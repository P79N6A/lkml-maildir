Because I believe one should *always* resist the urge to write
infrastructure.  Wait until the users of your functionality gather out
the front of your house with torches because they're all sick of the
burden of using existing infrastructure.
Really.
I don't even want to learn 28 bitops primitives.  I certainly don't want
to learn 28 nodemask and 28 cpumask primitives.
I prefer a single set of operators, but preempting complaints means
figuring out what people want.  I'd be happy with the obviously
cpu-specific ones, myself:
	first_cpu
	next_cpu
	any_online_cpu
	cpumask_of_cpu

Agreed.  That's a big benefit of cutting it out altogether.

That'd be a noop, I think.
Cheers,
Rusty.
