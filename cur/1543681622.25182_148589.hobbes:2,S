Looks good, but are you _really_ building all of those drivers into your
kernel?  Make them modules, that way booting will not require a small
nap :)
Then load only the i2c bus driver that you have.  See if that causes the
system to slow down, or cause any kernel log messages?
Only then try loading a i2c client driver, for your hardware.
Exactly what i2c hardware do you have anyway?
thanks,
