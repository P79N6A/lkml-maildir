Subject: e2fsck bogus message

e2fsck complains "Your /etc/fstab does not contain the fsck
passno field..." when there are no entries in /etc/fstab.
This message is bogus in this case.
Why I don't have any entries?
I refer to my root fs as /dev/root (thanks to devfs)
and I have nothing else to mount yet.
