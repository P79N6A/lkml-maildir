This patch is from John Rose <johnrose@austin.ibm.com>.
The function __ioremap_explicit() misses a possible (obscure) case when
reserving the imalloc area for the new region.	This can result in the
unexpected DLPAR-add failure for an I/O slot.  The failure will be
characterized by a kernel message resembling "could not obtain imalloc area for
ea 0x..." Here's an explanation:
At boot time, imalloc regions are created for the ranges of all PHBs.  Upon 
removal of a child slot for one of these PHBs, the imalloc region is split
so that the region for the child slot can be removed.
A GFW testcase revealed the following scenario.  A PHB is remapped at boot for
virtual address range A through C.  At boot, the partition owns a slot that
spans from A to B.  This slot is DLPAR-removed, leaving an imalloc region from
B to C.  At this point, the user DLPAR adds an EADS slot that was not present
at boot, but is a child of the PHB.  The new slot happens to have a range that
directly matches the leftover PHB range, from B to C.  The existing code does
not expect this, so the operation fails.
