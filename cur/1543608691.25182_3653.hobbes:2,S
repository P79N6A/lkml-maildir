Well, it's hard to see how the fsck could hurt, since all the blocks of the 
directory look like legitimate empty blocks.  When did

True.  Right now, I'm interested in finding out exactly how the old fscks are 
going to behave when they run into indexed directories, so I'll leave the 
COMPAT flag off for now and turn it back on when we hit the first 
format-frozen release.  The method of restoring a partition to a fsckable 
state is easy to document:
    # debugfs -w root_fs
    debugfs: feature -dir_index
Anybody who's running the patch will have access to a recent version of 
debugfs that knows about the dir_index flag.

Yes, as long as testers heed my warning and stick to test partitions there's 
no particular danger.  There's a simple recovery procedure for anyone who 
doesn't want to bother re-mkfsing the partition.  We're in pretty good shape. 
My improved show_buckets routine is working code that could be used to get 
started on the new fsck code.  It walks the index in hash bucket order 
dumping out statistics, and, together with the checks in dx_probe, basically 
defines the index format.
