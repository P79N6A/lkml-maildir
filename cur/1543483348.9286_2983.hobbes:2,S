	OK, several questions: does it happen on both sides? Only on the
slow one? What happens if you are pinging the thing? I.e. does another
side see your packets? (ifconfig)
	Another thing: could you include printk's (with KERN_DEBUG
priority) into ENABLE/DISABLE (guess why they became macros ;-) and
into the beginning/end of plip_send_packet/plip_receive_packet?
(convenient variant being: < and > for send, { and } for receive, E(line)
for enable, D(line) for disable). Try to beat the fscker into the hangup
and extract the stuff from the log. It should demonstrate the path where
the shit hits the fan.

	Erm... Look two lines above that piece. It happens only for
sending.

	See above. I agree that reassigning error was dirty hack, but
originally I had written (error == HS_TIMEOUT || error == ERROR &&
nl->connection==PLIP_CN_SEND), looked at the wrapped line and decided that
we could remap ERROR -> HS_TIMEOUT in if() several lines above and be done
with that. Probably it required a comment. Sorry.

<shrug> I have a nasty gut feeling that you've got a race or two that way.
I can't back it right now, but... OK, I'll dig out my records and look
them through. BTW, there is another implementation of PLIP and we can't
say 'Linux<->Linux link works, screw everything else'. Actually there are
at least two other impementations: BSD one and original Russell's (for
DOS).

	Races.

	Ahem... Look at it that way: system call is an additional
processor instruction for userland. Signals correspond to
software-generated interrupts. Real hardware interrupts are mapped to
something similar. We have two-stage mechanism - IRQ triggers the handler
that should do absolute minimum (ACK the interrupt, do IO that should
be done *immediately*) and schedule the appropriate bottom-halves. Bottom
halves are executed on the return from system call, on the rescheduling,
amd on return from exception. It is also done upon the return from IRQ
handling. Bottom halves are executed with interrupts enabled, but they are
serialized wrt each other (grep for do_bottom_half and you'll see).
	If you disable IRQ from bh it will stay disabled. Next call of bh
may never happen if the only beast that schedules it is the first-stage
IRQ handler sitting on the (disabled) IRQ.
	In case of PLIP there are two bottom halves. One (plip_bh) is
scheduled by interrupt (plip_interrupt) and by the other bh
(plip_kick_bh). plip_kick_bh is scheduled by timer. Typical scenario:
<interrupt>
plip_bh either does everything or does part of work and schedules
plip_kick_bh. In the later case after a while (1/100s) plip_kick_bh
happens and schedules plib_bh, yodda, yodda. That's a receiving side.
Sending side is activated by ethernet layer and then goes the same way. 
plip.c emulates a card with 5 subsystems:
1) byte-sender
2) byte-receiver
3) packets-sender
4) packet-receiver
5) top-level control
Each part has its own state. Think of them as of separate ICs. Top-level
part decides what parts will work on the next step and resets them if
needed. It also listens to requests from the kernel (send) and interrupts
from the line (receive). 
	I don't like the idea of leaving the IRQ enabled by several
reasons. First of all, it has a chance to confuse the hell of top-level
part. Another thing being:
<rant intensity=mild>
	 Russell did a messy work when he designed the protocol. We have 5
incoming lines. One of them triggers interrupt. When we read from the port
we get those lines in bits 7,5,4 and 3. Interrupt line is in bit 6.
Russell <substitute your favourite expletive> decided to use bits 6,5,4
and 3 for data and bit 7 for sync. Sheesh...  Yes, sir, shuffling bits
would be terrible. Except that we can create a table and use it instead of
bitops. Yes, whole horrible 512 bytes.  Sync-on-intr would be much nicer,
but no such luck. And we can't change the protocol - compatibility hits
and all such. We could implement the second protocol and that would be the
Right Thing, but that's another story. 
</rant>
	Please, try to put printk's into the code and look at the log. It
shouldn't hang. Since it does I'ld like to know *why* it happens. We can
try to woodoo it out, but it will mean that we are in for the next portion
of shit several releases later ;-/ I'ld *really* like to look at the log.
I can't reproduce the problem here, so your assistance is needed.
