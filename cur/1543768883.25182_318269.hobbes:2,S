Yes, but Ben has SATA, which is the hardware in question.
The 400nS delay which interests you so much in this thread isn't the 
interesting delay.  The 400nS delay isn't going away.  The 
udelay(10)-in-a-loop is what slows things down, and shows up on Ben's 
profiles.
The best solution is to convert PIO from polling to interrupt driven, so 
that we're not beating up the bus (big reason for the udelay).

After a tiny period of time, it's required to have set the BSY bit.
