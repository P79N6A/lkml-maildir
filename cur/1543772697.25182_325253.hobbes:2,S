It's longer than PIT overflow, which means it can be used.

PIT + PM timer / TSC is already working quite nicely. Of course it does not
allow long sleeps, but it still helps in bringing down the HZ to about 35HZ.

I don't have any x86 HPET hardware right now. But it sounds like it should
allow multisecond skipping of ticks.
