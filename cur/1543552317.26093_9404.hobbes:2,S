Subject: getting include-files from arch/<arch>/subdir

I need to include (in a driver) a header-file from arch/<arch>/subdir. I
could, of course,
do something like #include "../../arch/i386/{etc}" with a couple of #ifdef's
to get things
working for each environment. I guess that's now the way to do it cleanly.
What would be _the_ way to do it?
Thanks.
