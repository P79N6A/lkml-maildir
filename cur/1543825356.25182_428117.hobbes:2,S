For workloads where plugging helps (ie. lots of smaller, contiguous
requests going into the IO layer), should be pretty good these days
due to multiple readahead and writeback.

If you submit IO, it will be needed at some point in time. The benefit
of plugging is to hold it there in anticipation of more IO to merge
with this request.
Not sure what you mean by IO request feeding point...?

It is a heuristic. I don't see anything obviously correct or incorrect
about it. If you were to submit some asynch requests and _knew_ that
no other requests would be merged with them, plugging would be the
wrong thing to do because the disks would be needlessly idle.

Because of this bug ;)
I'm not saying it would never be of any benefit; I was hoping that it
might be unneeded and getting rid of it would fix this bug and
simplify a lot too.
Anyway, clearly a plug friendly bugfix needs to be implemented
regardless.
