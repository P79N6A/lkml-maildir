Admittedly, extent-based might not be a particularly bad answer at least to 
the I/O side of the equation...
I do feel larger blocksizes continue to make sense in general though. Packet 
writing on CD/DVD is a problem already today since the hardware needs 32K or 
64K blocks and I'd expect to see more of these and similiar situations when 
flash gets (even) more popular which it sort of inevitably is going to be.
Rene.
