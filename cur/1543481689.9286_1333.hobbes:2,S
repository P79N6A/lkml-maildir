sure, 'mail mmuscovi < ./42bytefile'. What are you trying to achieve and
why?

what do you mean by 'true'. what is 'user capabilities'. If you mean
military grade security, where one can restrict a user to be able only to
execute the 'nop' assembly instruction, then you are right, Linux's doesnt
want to do that. Linux has a capability model that splits up _system_
priviledges (thus risks) so that eg. a security hole in 'ping' doesnt mean
a full system compromise.

take a look at async networking IO, fcntl(SETSIG), etc, implemented by
Stephen Tweedie recently. (it's in 2.2)

Albert, do you have the slightest clue how often it happens to restart a
system call, in a typical Linux system? Just for kicks, i've added a small
hack to my kernel 5 minutes ago to count them:
total syscalls: 28456
restarted syscalls: 7
what overhead exactly are you complaining about? ...

the application sees _nothing_ from a system call restart to begin with.
It's handled in libc.
