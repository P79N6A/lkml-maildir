It is checkpatch's role to point out things which are likely to be
wrong.  There will always be exceptions.  Lines whihc are much more
readable if they spill over 80 characters, typedefs which do make sense.
atomic_t's for example.  This may well be a valid use of them.  Note
that this is mentioned as a WARNING not an ERROR.  As is stated in the
patch submission notes, you are meant to be comfortable with everything
which checkpatch is still reporting.
checkpatch is a style _guide_, not the be all and end all.  It is meant
to carry a preferred style to try and maintain some consistency kernel
wide.
