And it appears to behave well. (A few hours compile/clean cycling kernel builds 
on that filesystem were OK).
Historically I've done:
sync
echo platform > /sys/power/disk
echo disk > /sys/power/state
# resume
and had filesystem corruption (only on this machine, my other hibernating xfs 
machines don't have this problem)
So doing:
xfs_freeze -f /scratch
sync
echo platform > /sys/power/disk
echo disk > /sys/power/state
# resume
xfs_freeze -u /scratch
Works (for now - more usage testing tonight)
