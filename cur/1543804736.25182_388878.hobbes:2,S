I had also had the problem that my Shuttle ST20G5 (a RS480 IGP based
system) hung in pci_init. This was with one of the Fedora Rawhide
kernels, after reporting it  Dave Jones fixed it cause the next rawhide
kernel worked again, maybe he could explain what it was, and where the
fix is (if it is the same thing, but it really looks like it).
