Maybe I should take performance numbers with the patch.
But is it too costly that flushing icache page only if a page is newly
installed into the system (PG_arch1) && it is mapped as executable ?
I don't want to leak this (stupid) corner case to the file system layer.
Hmm...can't we do clever flushing (like your idea) in VM layer ?
