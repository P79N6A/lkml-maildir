Yes.  UNIX semantics dictate that unlinking an open file (and it's open if
it's mounted) simply removes its directory entry.  The inodes and whatnot
are not reclaimed until the last user closes the file.

... because it's busy deallocating inodes and marking blocks as free.

You can't remove the directory the image is mounted on, but the image file
is fair game.  It's just another file, after all, that a process (well, I
guess the kernel's not a process, but it's close enough) happens to have
open.
