Hi Jeff, et all
I pulled this down last night from 
git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git
as I don't have an account on master.kernel.org, I assume these are the 
same physical tree.
This built fine and seemed aware of all the SATA disks on my controller 
(as did previous git branches).
Again using my raid5 (7 disks 1.4tb) example, I am unable to build an 
array without the machine hanging.
I am able to access the individual disks for a short period of time 
before the box hangs totally which I assume is why the raid array will 
not build as the access for the disks hangs, not the actual building of 
the array.
I havn't got any output yet on the errors (if there are any) as I left 
the array building overnight (300+ minutes) and when I woke up this 
morning the box had hung, but power saver had come on the screen so I 
couldn't see the messages.
I'll do another test this afternoon and try to get some output for you, 
but I just thought I'd let you know this was coming.
Aslo FYI: I'm using maxtor SATA disks, so your patch was of particular 
interesting to me.
Many thanks,
Matt
