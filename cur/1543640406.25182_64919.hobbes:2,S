yes, this is ugly beyond belief.
eg. under bash start up some code that blocks, eg:
	# cat
the shell will not display a prompt, it wait4()s for the 'cat' process to 
exit.
strace the bash PID - it shows the wait4().
strace 'cat' PID (via strace -p) and keep the strace running - it will
show 'cat' blocked on console input. [some signal like this could happen
to a shell anyway, in a reasonably complex script.]
now do something that breaks bash out of its wait4 - eg. send a 'kill
-SIGCONT BASH_PID' signal - bash returns with a prompt! The 'cat' becomes
a 'background' task - and it gets majorly confused when doing the next
shell command in bash - it displays "cat: -: Input/output error" and goes
zombie.
ptrace is clearly broken - and i tested this with a stock 2.4 kernel.
