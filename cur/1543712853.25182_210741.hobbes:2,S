AFAIK choosing the optimal latency timer for each device on a PCI bus is
not a trivial thing, one needs to take into account a lots of things.
But making it a "bit smarter" would be "good enough".

My BIOS seems to always initialize the latency timer. There is a menu
in which one can choose the value (32, 64, 96, etc), and the default
setting (when "loading failsafe settings" or "loading optimized
settings") is 64 (that is where the value is coming from). The BIOS
does not offer an "auto" value that would be computed dynamically for
optimal performances.
