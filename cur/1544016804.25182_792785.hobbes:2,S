I have another question for you Arnd.
What did you use as the host and guest drivers when you ran virtio over
PCI? Did you use two unmodified instances of virtio_net (one on host,
one on guest) for networking, or did you write new virtio drivers for
those? How about for virtio_console (if you ran it at all).
Thanks again,
