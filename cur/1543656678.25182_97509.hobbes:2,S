Having the driver for the root device not load from the initrd kind of
sucks as well. Actually I always build the loopback and ramdisk in, I
don't want to find out if initrd boot would work without them ;-)
But trying to build a single kernel for multiple configs of hardware is
much harder if you can't just roll multiple initrd files from the single
compile. I guess you can build every possible driver in, but I'd rather
not.
