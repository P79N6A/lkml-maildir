What is the reason that sys_close should not be used by modules ?

There are some checks that might be skipped. But I think that calling
sys_close is the right thing to do here, because this way future changes
to the procedure of closing an open fd will not need to be copied to
the recovery code of load_misc_binary. Do you expect there will be any
visible gain in performance if the unnecessary steps are skipped ?
Please
remember this is only recovery code - this is not the main stream
execution.
Thanks,
Yoav.
