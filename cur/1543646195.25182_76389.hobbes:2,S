Hi,
after the call of linus for giving the 2.5.40 a test I decided to make my 
first experiences with the new kernel series.
But I was'nt very lucky, the make menuconfig breaks when I try to enter the 
following entry:
sound -> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture -> 'crash'
The relevant part of the error is:
Q> ./scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu74: command not found
I've no special hardware here and if you need more informations please ask ;-)
any hints how I can get the alsa stuff into the kernel?
regards
micha
ps: I hope it's all correct with this post, its my first mail to lkml...
