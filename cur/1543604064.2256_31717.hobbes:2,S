Yesterday, I was able to observe my machine running 2.4.10 
half-crash while mozilla tried to dump core: Six minutes after 
core.<pid> had been created for the process in question, any process 
trying to read /proc/<pid>/stat (which still existed then; note that 
there was no disk activity at that point) would hang, and was 
apparently unkillable.
There was no ooops or kernel panic in the logs.
