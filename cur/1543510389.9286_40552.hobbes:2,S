I should have thought of that earlier.. but  I added that to
/etc/conf.modules -- The kernel doesn't complain about
finding the synth0 module, but midi player complains about No such device
/dev/sequencer. The permissions for it are as follows:
crw-------   1 compwiz  sys       14,   1 Apr 17 15:53 /dev/sequencer
I'm assuming the owner is compwiz because that's the owner of the console
at the time..
