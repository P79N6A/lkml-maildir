Yes.
For the coretemp developers: coretemp_cpu_callback() needs to be more 
careful about what it does.  During a system sleep transition (suspend, 
hibernate, resume) it isn't possible to register or unregister a 
device.  Attempts to register will fail and attempts to unregister will 
block until the system sleep is over -- and for this callback that 
means hanging.
It's not clear what the best way is to fix this.  Perhaps the CPU 
notification should be sent along with a special flag indicating that 
the CPU transition is part of a system sleep (although this seems 
racy).  Perhaps the driver should notice when a system sleep begins, 
and defer all CPU-change handling until after the sleep is over.
