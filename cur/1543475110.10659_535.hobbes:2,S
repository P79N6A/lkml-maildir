Well, you could increase /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/eth0/base_reachable_time
from 30sec to something about twice longer, than tftp time
and, probably, /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/eth0/delay_first_probe_time
to tftp time.
What is not clear: 15sec should be enough to load image.
I have an impression, that this arp entry never enters to reachable
state (i.e. server never receives arp reply) Could you make tcpdump?

No, it does not. When host works normally, forward progress
notifications and lazy arping make their work and total
number of unicast pings is less than it was in 2.0.
