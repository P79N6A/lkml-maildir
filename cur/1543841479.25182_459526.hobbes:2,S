Help and Search options aren't much use if you cannot see the option and if
you do not know that it exists.
A better UI design would be to show the unselectable option in some
dimmed-out fashion and then provide an interface which permits the user to
a) query the item to find out why it's not selectable and
b) turn on the depends-on option(s) at the present site, thus making the
   present item selectable (ie: not dimmed any more).
I dont't think any of that would require any Kconfig changes - it's purely
a UI thing?
