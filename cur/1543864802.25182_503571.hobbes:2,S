To give proper credit firescope originally came from Ben Herrenschmidt
for PPC. I just ported it to x86 with a few changes.
BTW if you like firescope you might also like fireproxy
http://www.suse.de/~bk/firewire/
There's also a early ohci1394 driver in there to make
firescope/fireproxy work earlier during boot, but it's still somewhat
experimental.
