Could you send the same info I requested before (available_clocksources,
current_clocksource, dmesg) for both good and bad configs? Also make
sure they're on the same kernel version (as the configs are from
slightly different kernel versions).

Bisecting the config difference is probably the most reliable way, but
you might try some shots in the dark first:
CONFIG_X86_VISWS: If I recall, this is support for SGI workstations that
had different apics then most systems, and might be related.
CONFIG_PARAVIRT_GUEST: I really haven't been paying much attention to
the paravirt bits, but this has some clock related subconfig options
that might be affecting it.
