For the same reason I tried several times to _introduce_ the 
"dev->release = (void (*)(struct device *))kfree" stuff in the zfcp device
driver, but Greg objected every time that it wouldn't be necessary.
I still disagree with him and that's why the zfcp module doesn't have a
module_exit function :)
