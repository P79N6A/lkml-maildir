The bit that scares me is the hook into effective_prio() in the
scheduler fast-path for the prio boost. It is a minimal op, but I know
how cautious are you guys on poking there.

That's what I did initially and many people barked at me because it made
sys_futex even uglier. Somebody [I can't remember the thread and I cannot
find it] said that sys_futex() should have been split in a number of syscalls
from the beginning, not multiplexing--and that they should do that in 2.7
to ease up a transition.
As well, I need to take different arguments [flags for the fulocks, for example].
For the sys_ufuqueue_*(), it makes sense to do a redirection for simplification,
emulating the sys_futex() thingies, but for fulocks, they are completely 
different beasts. It makes little sense, it is a locking interface, not a 
waitqueue interface.

I'll work on the sys_futex() redirection to ufuqueues during today [let's
see if I can get something done before taking off on vacation] and as soon
as I come back, but for the ufulocks...the interface is too different. I
think it makes more sense to clean up the glibc implementation, make a truly
layered set of calls redirecting the lll_ stuff at compile time [and run
time where needed/desired] that would allow the user to select what he wants
to do (when in the know) and default to the best combination for the general
public.
