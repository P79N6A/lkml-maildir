I got the same as well here on my box.
I am using Red Hat 9, with a lot of things upgraded.
I found other "hints" that this might be a binutils issue,
which obviously hasn't been touched in years on Red Hat 9,
so I picked up the binutils built for Fedora Core 3,
and installed them...
That solved the problem.
