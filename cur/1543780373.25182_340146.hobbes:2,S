As far as I remember enabling AMD stop grant disconnects all cpus. This
means the system won't be able to do any work until the dyntick timer
interrupt wakes up the system.

Probably all AMD SMP based systems? Somebody with better knowledge should

Not in the current case, as the system is completely idle until some
interrupt wakes up the system. Of course it would be different if you make
it per-CPU.

Well we need to be able to do various things in the idle loop depending on
the length of the estimated sleep. For example, if next_timer_interrupt is
2 jiffies away, we cannot do much. But if next_timer_interrupt is 2 seconds
away, we can idle pretty much all devices.

Yeah. It only seems to work on P3 systems.

Cool :) Sounds like SMP and HPET are about the only things that still need
work. Or can somebody think of anything else?

OK
