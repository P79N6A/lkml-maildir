Thank you very much for clarifying.

I'm all for 64-bit support, and for easy transition from 32 to 64 bits. 
Really: I was around to watch the pain of transition from 16 bits to 32 
bits, and I'm thrilled to see people taking the problem more seriously 
this time.
So: does it help to specify that the sys_security arguments be (say) 
"unsigned int"?  Then you can just zero-pad them, or truncate them.
And even if the 32bit emulation layer doesn't perfectly translate the 
sys_security arguments: that just breaks LSM modules. It would not 
surprise me that something like an application trying to talk to a 
security module might not cleanly port from 32 to 64 bits. By carefully 
stating the assumptions (clean data types) most of these problems should 
be addressed.
I don't get why this is a hard problem.
