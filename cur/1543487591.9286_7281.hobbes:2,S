What would the consequences be of a select-like call which had the semantic
that only one of the tasks sleeping for that resource was woken (the
longest-sleeping, perhaps)? (And, probably, all tasks sleeping because
of regular select())  To my naive mind it sounds like a way to avoid
the thundering herd problem.  Are there unforseen pitfalls in this, or is
it more a matter of doing something nonstandard, or of the change requiring
widespread kernel changes?
