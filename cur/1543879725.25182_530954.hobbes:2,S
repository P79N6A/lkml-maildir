Subject: [patch] use C99 initialisers for PCI_VDEVICE()

Not much to say about the patch (it's against 2.6.20.6), it just converts a 
macro to generate C99-style initialisers.

However, I still have two issues with this:
1. It explicitly allows in the comments for PCI_VDEVICE to have non-C99 fields 
follow for the driver_data field. IMHO this is wrong per se (just as 
old-style initialisers are), so the comment should perhaps be removed.
2. What happens to fields not initialised with this? I believe that these are 
initialised with zero, just like missing fields in old initialisers are, 
right? In that case, I would remove the initialisers for class and 
class_mask, so that people can at least optionally use them. However, this 
goes hand in hand with issue #1 because it would definitely break code that 
lets old-style initialisers follow.
As far as issue #2 is concerned, I did some checking (grep -r PCI_VDEVICE) and 
the only places where this is at all used is in the ATA code (drivers/ata)! 
Hmmm, no problem, that is grunt work but easily patched, too. If consensus 
exists that the class/class_mask fields should be removed, I hereby volunteer 
to submit a patch for that and the ATA code.
