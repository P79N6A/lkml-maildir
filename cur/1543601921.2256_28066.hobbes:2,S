Just booted pre13 and I notice this line in ps:
eyal       631  0.0 99.9  8232 4294965340 ?  S    00:41   0:00
/usr/bin/X11/xterm -sb -j -ls -fn 7x14 -geometry 80x80
Also in top:
  PID USER     PRI  NI  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  LIB %CPU %MEM   TIME
COMMAND
  631 eyal       9   0  5656  -1M   992 S       0  0.0 99.9   0:00 xterm
This is one of a few xterms I have open. Not a special one, it is active
and shows no trouble.
However, the system itself is suffering. It has been a long while since
I last had these long pauses, every minute or so, where everything
freezes. And the machine is practically idle all this time.
