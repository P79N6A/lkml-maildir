-I have a IDT Winchip 240 running under Linux myself on a SIS chipset based
 board (and you??) and i have no problem with my 128 MB RAM.
-I can only run my Winchip with 486 optimization. With higher (pentium...)
 my system crashes after 1-5 hours!!! (no debug-reg output, not pingable ...)
 (i'm not sure wheather i tryed newer kernels than 2.2.5 :-( )
