Hmm? I tried it, and for me it does:
	torvalds@home:~> ./a.out 
	SIGNAL .... 11
	Segmentation fault
but I have to admit that I didn't even try it before my kernel change, so 
maybe it worked for me before too ;)
There could easily be glibc version issues here, ie maybe your library 
sets SA_NOMASK and mine doesn't.
