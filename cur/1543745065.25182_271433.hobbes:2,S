Doing it with variables is not exactly the same. The compiler has been told to
optimise arithmetic on constants, and as such it has to represent a div-by-0
result, which obviously it can't.
Now, I agree that given the if-condition automatically precludes the div-by-0,
but maybe that's asking too much. Perhaps I should go and raise hell over it
with the gcc posse.

And drop the conditional entirely? I can go along with that.

Not unless you spell colour correctly:-)
