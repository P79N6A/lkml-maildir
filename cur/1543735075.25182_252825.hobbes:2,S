It's a can of worms, is what it is.  And I'm not sure what a good fix
would be.  Would it just be enough to send a generic "mount-table changed"
event, and let userspace figure out the rest?
Or really, why is the kernel broadcasting a mount, which originated in
userland.  Couldn't mount (or a mount wrapper) do that?  It's already
running in the right namespace...
