Hmm. I don't understand here yet... Could you explain more? 
This issue occurs only when ZONE_MOVABLE is specified.
If its boundary is aligned to MAX_ORDER automatically,
I guess user will not mind it.
From memory hotplug view, I prefer section size alignment to make
simple code. :-P

Anyway, the patch works well.
Bye.
