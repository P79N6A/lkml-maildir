I was going to answer that we do bforget() everywhere so that the problem
does not arise. But checking I find a handful of brelse()'s as well.
Probably you should change these to bforget().
Other than that, I do not think your problem occurs.
On the other hand, a problem that does occur is the aliasing
between block 15003 of hda and block 3 of hda2.
It is a misdesign of the buffer cache. [Wait until 2.5 before repairing.]
The current state of affairs causes strange things around fdisk
and various partition repair programs.
