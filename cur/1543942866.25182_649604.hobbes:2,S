Yeah, andrew already complained about that, fixed up.

Oh yeah, definitely agree, I wrote that in the intro as well. The
interface is horrible, not meant to go anywhere, just serve for testing.

That's definitely a possibility, Nick had something like that. I just
didn't like having to allocate a cookie object to store the function and
data.

That would indeed be nicer and not require any arch changes. I was
afraid it would be more costly than massaging the softirqs a bit though,
perhaps that is unfounded.
