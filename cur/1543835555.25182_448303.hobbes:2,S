Ok, that's probably way over my head, but I'll dig in none the less
and see what I can do to help. It'll probably land me in a world of
hurt, but I've taken flames before and I'm still here ;-)
Don't expect much, but I'll see if there's anything I can do at least.

Ok, that is (again) probably beyond me, but I'll still take a look at
it just for the hell of it.
If nothing else I can at least keep an eye out for when we reach the
point we want to be at and then submit renaming patches...  let's
