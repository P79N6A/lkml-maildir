It was a bug in our original nForce reference BIOS that we gave out to vendors.  Since then we fixed the reference BIOS, but since it was after products shipped, most of the motherboard vendors won't pick up the change unless they get complaints from customers.
We've fixed it for our reference BIOS for future products though.
