There's nothing stopping you from adding that functionality to the kernel
_you_ use. That doesn't mean you should expect Linus to accept patches that
are relatively untested to the stable kernel. You can use the patch with
your stable kernel and at the same time port it to the latest development
kernel and hope it gets accepted in time for the next stable release.
It seems as if this is getting even easier now that people are working to
shorten the development cycle.
