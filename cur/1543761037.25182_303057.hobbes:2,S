i don't think i've run plain 2.6.10 at all, syslog does not say so. i've
run several versions of 2.6.9, then 2.6.10-rc1, 2.6.10-rc1-bk19,
2.6.10-rc2-bk9, 2.6.10-rc3-bk11, 2.6.11-rc2-bk10, 2.6.11-rc5-bk2.
as stated earlier, the problem kicked in when i switched to 2.6.11, i
switched back to 2.6.11-rc5-bk2 and it happened again. by looking at the
syslog i am (still) suspecting pppd to be the source of OOM, but it did
not show up as a memory pig in "ps". i am running 2.6.11.3 now and the
machine survived almost 2 passes of pppd's daily hangups. i'll keep an eye
on it.
thank you for your concern,
Christian.
