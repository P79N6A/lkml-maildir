Sorry, but this sort of statement can't help but piss me off. I do all
the work forward porting 2.4 IDE to 2.5, then you slap a LAD label on it
(why?! To sprinkle it with "LAD Storage Consulting Group" [1] pee?) and
claim the foundation on which you stand is _broken_?
Feel free to point out where I'm wrong.
[1] 'group' meant more than 1, last I checked.
