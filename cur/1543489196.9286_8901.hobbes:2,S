Subject: [CFT] rename patch (2.2.3)

	Folks, I've rediffed rename patch against 2.2.3 and had put it to
ftp://ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/rename-patch-9.gz
	There were no changes since the moment when 2.2.2 came out
(actually even earlier). I run it here and I consider it a stable code (at
least as stable as the current code in the kernel). AFAIC it is the final
variant. I'm submitting it to Linus.
							Cheers,
								Al
