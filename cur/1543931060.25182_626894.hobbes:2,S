I tried unrolling the loop, but a single byte read for i = 0 is enough to lock things up.

Unfortunately, I don't know. I swapped this card out of the old 2.4.x machine into a machine
already running Fedora 7. The card works when I put it back into the 2.4 machine too, so it's not
a hardware problem with the card.
So I suppose the next step would be trying a linux 2.6.0 kernel? Or was hostap included in the
kernel later than that?
Cheers,
Chris
