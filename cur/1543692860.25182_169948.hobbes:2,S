My argument against that is that it actually loses information. Now there 
is no way to easily look up the current thread stuff.
If /proc/self points to a thread, it's easy to look up the process with a 
"/proc/self/../..".
So in that sense it's a bad interface to point to the process, not the 
thread.

It's not hidden. It would just point to the real thread directory..
