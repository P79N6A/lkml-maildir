I am not sure if it will handle EXPORT_SYMBOL correctly. Sometimes
we have the situation that a function is only referenced from EXPORT_SYMBOL,
but we do not want the linker to drop it because modules may use it.
(this regularly causes problems in lib-y files) 
If it did it would be great to use though. I am sure there are other
dead functions around too. Or maybe someday we could even use the 
IPA functionality in gcc 3.4 ...
