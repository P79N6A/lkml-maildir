Has anyone else seen SEGVs from this combination ?
/var/log/xdm.log is less than helpfull, only mentioning that VC7 (I run
X on 3 VCs) had a Signal 11.
I've not yet identified whats running on VC7, and not on VC8-9 that might
be causing this...  Wish xdm gave a little more information...
Sigh, back to 2.2.19prex on this box (the rest of my boxen are running
2.4.1-ac20 w/o problem (ok, except for the olympic.c nit)
Thanks,
