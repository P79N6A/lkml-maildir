Subject: Patch 2.2.11 oddness?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I observed what I thought was an
odd "one-liner" when I was looking
at the diff's in the patch for
kernel 2.2.11 (as received from
ftp.us.kernel.org.)
There appears to be a short error
message:
  "\ No newline at end of file"
that appears at the end of the section
containing the diff's for arlan.c.
I didn't notice anything until *after*
I updated 2.2.10 to 2.2.11, when I was
looking through the diff to see what
changed...
Please see attached snippet below.
My apologies if this is a "multi-post"...
I've been off the list for 2 weeks.
The retrieval from kernel.org and gunzip
went without incident. The patch applied
cleanly.  As a consequence, I don't think
the file was corrupted....
So far, 2.2.11 plays very nicely  :-)
Regards,
Paul
[ Ohhh, and I don't know what an "arlan"
is, either ;-)  ]
