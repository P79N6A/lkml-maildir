When they are suitable for Marcelo, I'm going to send them to Marcelo.
As I wrote in the quoted message, they need some more patches, and I'm 
also interested in feedback from Intel Q/A (which is scheduled for 
sometime this week).
If you are interesting in maintaining 2.4.x patches for a short time, go 
for it.  But I would rather not have a almost-ready e100 go to Marcelo 
and get released in 2.4.19 in incomplete form.  It's out there, it's 
public, let's leave at that for a little while.
