Unfortunately, the current code is racey even on the S/390.
We originally wanted to use the IPTE instruction to flush
a particular TLB entry, and this requires that the old PTE
value is still present at the time IPTE is performed.
Thus we wanted to place IPTE inside flush_tlb_page, and have
flush_tlb_page called before the new PTE is written.  However,
even with the current establish_pte routine this doesn't work,
as flush_tlb_page is called from several other places *after*
the PTE has been changed, so we still cannot actually use IPTE.
So, what we do now is simply flush the complete TLB in
flush_tlb_page, and don't use IPTE at all.  This is obviously
not ideal, but at least correct.  Except, that is, for the
race condition in establish_pte that we now share with the
other architectures :-/
IMO you should apply Steve's patch (without any #ifdef __s390__) now.
However, we'd like to look further for a more general solution
that would allow us to make use of IPTE again in the future.
This would possibly involve something like making establish_pte
architecture-specific.
