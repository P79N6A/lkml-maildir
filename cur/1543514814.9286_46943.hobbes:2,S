The names tell it. le32_to_cpu is used for convesions from 32bit little
endian data into CPUs endianness, cpu_to_le32 is used for convesions from
CPU endianness to little endian 32bit data.
Actually, both macros do the same thing, but one should make the differences
clear to make code more readable so that anyone can quickly find out whether
some data is kept in native endianness or some particular one.
