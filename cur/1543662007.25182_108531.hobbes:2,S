I certainly agree, but the problem is the NDA puts the shoe on the
other foot and now it's the customer that has to consult a lawyer or
risk a nuisance suit before proceeding. So while it may not forbid, it
certainly discourages and impedes. Let me point out that I never saw
the NDA in question but said coworker was sufficiently intimidated by
it that he was unwilling to give me a copy of the kernel and gcc
sources because of it.
Not that it ended up mattering - I managed to get stock Debian running
on the board with all the board support I needed in a matter of a
couple of days.
