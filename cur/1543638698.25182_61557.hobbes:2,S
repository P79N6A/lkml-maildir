I'm having trouble getting the 2.5 kernels from 2.5.5 onwards to run on my
Pentium 200 MMX system. The same kernels all work fine on my K6-2-400. I am
compiling for the right processor (I've tried a few different ones with no
effect).
It's getting to the "Uncompressing Linux..." stage but I never get the Ok
message. The actual crash varies as below. My .config is attached. I'll work
on this some more tomorrow but any hints would be appreciated. Is there a
way I can take out the highmem update that was part of 2.5.5 to see if its
that?
The results of different versions are as follows:
2.5.1 works
2.5.4 works
2.5.5:
Uncompressing Linux...
crc error
 -- System halted
2.5.6: reboots just after loading into memory
2.5.8: reboots just after loading into memory
2.5.15:
Uncompressing Linux...
invalid compressed format (err=1)
 -- System halted
2.5.30 same as 2.5.15:
Thanks,
RP
