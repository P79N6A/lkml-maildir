I just tried it and - no it does not work.  
At least not with the following changes:
added #define PF_MEMDIE  0x00001000 to sched.h
replaced oom_kill.c with the 2.4.22 version
added out_of_memory() to the end of try_to_free_pages_zone()
replaced if (current->flags & PF_MEMALLOC && !in_interrupt()) {
with
replaced if ((current->flags & (PF_MEMALLOC | PF_MEMDIE)) && !in_interrupt()
) {
in page_alloc.c
effect is still unchanged. 
processes get killed by VM and not oom_kikll.c
any hints ??
