We have redone the I/O layer in the Altix code.
We are posting this code for review before submitting for
inclusion in the 2.5 tree.
The code can be seen at:
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/sn2/sn2-update/
The general changes are:
o added new hardware support
o ran all code thru Lindent
o code cleanup (typedefs, include files, etc.)
o simplified the directory structure (all files under arch/ia64/sn/io/
  are deleted, new files are under arch/ia64/sn/ioif/)
o code size reduced by >50%
o major reorg of the code itself
o copyright updates
The code is organized in the following manner:
diffs_of_common_c_files - this has the diffs of 'C' files that were changed
                          but not renamed.
diffs_of_common_h_files - this has the diffs of include files that were changed
                          but not renamed.
diffs_of_renamed_files  - this has the diffs of all files that were renamed.
source_code.tar.gz      - tarball of new source files.
Source_code_tree/       - directory of new source files.
The diffstats are:
=> diffstat diffs_of_common_c_files
