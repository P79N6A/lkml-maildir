Hello, Keith!
I also noticed this error when I upgraded from ac9 to ac11.
My understanding is that if "make depend" is run on the sources that have
already been compiled, then names.o depends on devlist.h (with full path)
is ".depend".
If I run "make clean" first, then everything is fine. But I think that
something must have been broken in ac10. I'm always running "make clean"
after "make depend" and it's the first time that I have a problem with it.
Regards,
Pavel Roskin
