If the problem is due to the card and driver then you can just restart
networ if you have root access.
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart
This will shutdown the network card driver and will start again.. that will
lead to start the card again which might help.

Hard to say what went wrong. I might need some more info like kernel
version, more log
info and wether the driver was builtin or module. When did you first
encounter this
problem??
