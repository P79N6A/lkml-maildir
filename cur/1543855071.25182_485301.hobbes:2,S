Rather than mark an existing entry as ready, how about a call to inject 
a new ready event?
This would be useful to implement functionality at userlevel and still 
use an event queue to announce the availability.  Without this type of 
functionality we'd need to use indirect notification via signal or pipe 
or something like that.
