Was that 10% speedup on suspend or resume, or both? With LZF, I see 
approximately double the speed with both reading and writing:
nigel@nigel:/usr/src$ sudo cat /sys/power/suspend2/debug_info
Suspend2 debugging info:
- SUSPEND core   : 2.2.7.2
- Kernel Version : 2.6.18-rc1
- Compiler vers. : 4.0
- Attempt number : 4
- Parameters     : 0 25 0 0 0 0
- Overall expected compression percentage: 0.
- Compressor is 'lzf'.
  Compressed 733736960 bytes into 349517344 (52 percent compression).
- Swapwriter active.
  Swap available for image: 244981 pages.
- Filewriter inactive.
- I/O speed: Write 79 MB/s, Read 77 MB/s.
- Extra pages    : -53 used/4000.
Without compression:
nigel@nigel:/usr/src$ sudo cat /sys/power/suspend2/debug_info
Suspend2 debugging info:
- SUSPEND core   : 2.2.7.2
- Kernel Version : 2.6.18-rc1
- Compiler vers. : 4.0
- Attempt number : 5
- Parameters     : 0 25 0 0 0 0
- Overall expected compression percentage: 0.
- Swapwriter active.
  Swap available for image: 244981 pages.
- Filewriter inactive.
- I/O speed: Write 39 MB/s, Read 38 MB/s.
- Extra pages    : -72 used/4000.
On resume, how are managing to keep the speed up? I implemented readahead of 
up to 2000 pages, only waiting on a page if we actually manage to submit the 
next 2000 pages for I/O and the page we're waiting on isn't yet complete. If 
you do something like that, how do you know when I/O is complete on the page 
you want?
Regards,
Nigel
