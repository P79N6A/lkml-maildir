Basically, I did a:
#if 0
	yenta init code here
#else
	printk("yenta_init() disabled\n");
#endif
Well, It appears that yenta_init() isn't required on my machine.  I can
ping, etc.  dmesg shows that printk above so I know it's not doing anything.
Until gpm (or any program reading /dev/psaux) is killed, the keyboard gets
locked the first mouse event that occures.
Since you meantioned something about messing with the power, I decided to
put a meter on my ps/2 port.  After thinking about it, the power on that is
probably hardwired (just guessing), but the voltage never dropped below
4.97, never above 5.00vdc
Any other idea's on the keyboard lockup/mouse disfunctional problem?
