Hi folks,
does anyone have an idea where this could come from? I used the same wicked
patchset as usual when building this 2.6.16-rc6 custom tree a few days ago, but
the thing oopses on me all the time. The funny part is that a -rc5 built exactly
the same way did not indulge in such inappropriate behaviour, so I figured the
gurus should have a chance of a look at this.
I have to admit that I played with some more recent compiler flags that came
with gcc-4.1, and am yet trying to narrow it down by cutting down the number of
patches added to vanilla, leaving cflag mods out altogether for the time being.
But, as stated above, same insanity added to -rc5 was perfectly smooth, -rc6 and
release 2.6.16 (plus my wicked patches) screw up.
This is the log excerpt from the last time my laptop became unusable because of
this, I merely switched from X to console and tried to login:
