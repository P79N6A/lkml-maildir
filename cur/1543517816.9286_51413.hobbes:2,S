	Alan, mingo, others...
	Wondering, does anyone have a clue how to rebuild a RAID mirror
when you know one half is good and the other half is bad?  My setup is
as follows;
	many disks->raid0(md0)--\ raid1 mirror(md2)
now bad-many disks->raid0(md1)--/
	One of the disks in one of the raid0 stripes had issues that have
now been resolved.  However, it's obviously no longer consistant with the
other disks in that raid0, or the raid1 mirror.  Now my question is, how
do I get it to rebuild the 2nd mirror?  Do I actually have to back
everything up, nuke the raid partition, and bring everything back?  I'm
running 2.2.13+raid0145-19990824 and raidtools 0.90.  Many thanks for
any help...
