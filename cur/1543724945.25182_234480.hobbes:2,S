I'd say "unclean shutdown is not going to cause any problems *if it
was due to powerfail". If unclean shutdown is caused by software
problem journaling is not guaranteed to help.

Well, if you suspend, resume and then your machine crashes, you should
better run fsck, or it is not going to be pretty. Problem is that
during bootup, its hard to tell if machine failed due to powerfail or
if software problem caused shutdown.
Of course, "5" is very wrong number in any case. Do you see any
non-ugly way to make it configurable?
