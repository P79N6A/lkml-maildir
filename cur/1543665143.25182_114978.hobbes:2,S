this does not appear to happen, at least with the current incarnation,
make -j5 jobs of the kernel tree (on UP), with your patch alone are
hoovering at a considerably higher dynamic priority than they are with my
patch. But interactivity itself is good as far as i can tell, in both
cases - but i think Andrew would be a better tester in this regard.
plus my patch doesnt really change the core CPU-hog detector, what it does
is that it changes the way children/parents will inherit priorities, plus
changes the order of how children get their first timeslice. The
end-effect is that the 'CPU-hog' make job is better recognized as that -
but X itself will not be recognized in any different way.
