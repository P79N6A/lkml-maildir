This is essentially what we are proposing, only instead of reading 4K,
read 1 sector and stash the 4-byte disk signature where we can get at
it later, and export it via edd.o for comparison later.  This much is
easy, as the empty_zero_page has 512 bytes free for reading the sector
in setup.S, and 4 bytes we can use to stash the signature until
setup.c runs where we can copy it somewhere safe.  Then export it via
edd.o through /proc (2.4) or /sys (2.6).
The thing that writes the signature to disk can be anything that can
issue int13 calls.  Right now we do it in a FreeDOS app, but a special
loadlin/syslinux/isolinux used for OS installation may be simpler and
not require a FreeDOS environment be run ever.
