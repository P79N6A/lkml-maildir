Ever since 2.6.29-rc, I see this in powertop on my macbook5,1:
Top causes for wakeups:
  24.1% ( 27.8)   USB device usb1 : OHCI Host Controller (Linux 2.6.29-rc2-wl-di
  21.5% ( 24.8)       <interrupt> : ohci_hcd:usb1 
  14.5% ( 16.7)   USB device  1-5 : IR Receiver (Apple Computer, Inc.) 
which is way way more than what it used to be, I never saw the IR
receiver before. I could bisect, but wondered if somebody had seen this
before?
