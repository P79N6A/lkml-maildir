Asking keventd to do this might be problematic: there may be code in various
dark corners of device drivers which also depend upon keventd services for
IO completion, in which case there might be obscure deadlocks, dunno. 
otoh, keventd already surely does GFP_KERNEL allocations...
But still, the whole thing seems pointless: kswapd is already doing all of
this, replenishing the page reserves.  So why not use that?

I'd say just remove the whole thing and use kmem_cache_alloc().
Put much effort into removing the GFP_ATOMIC and using GFP_NOIO instead:
there's your problem right there.
If for some reason you really can't do that (and a requirement for
allocation-in-interrupt is the only valid reason, really) and if you indeed
can demonstrate memory allocation failures with certain workloads then
let's take a look at that.  As I said, attaching a reserve pool to your
slab cache might be a suitable approach.  But none of these things are
magic: if memory allcoation failures or deadlocks or livelocks are
demonstrable with the reserves absent, then they'll also be possible with
the reserves present.
Unless you use mempools, and can sleep.
