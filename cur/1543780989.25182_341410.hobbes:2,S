But are you using libc6-i686? That enables NPTL. Perhaps the behavior
difference is there? I'm surprised int 80 doesn't really cause an
interrupt; it doesn't jump to the appropriate place in the x86 vector
table? Interesting.

root@jcarr:~# dpkg -s libc6-i686
...
 This set of libraries is optimized for i686 machines, and will only be
 used if you are running a 2.6 kernel on an i686 class CPU (check the
 output of `uname -m').  This includes Pentium Pro, Pentium II/III/IV,
 Celeron CPU's and similar class CPU's (including clones such as AMD
 Athlon/Opteron, VIA C3 Nehemiah, but not VIA C3 Ezla).
 .
 This package includes support for NPTL.
