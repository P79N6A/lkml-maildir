My name is Dayo Adams and I am an artist.I live in Netherland,with my two
kids, four cats, one dog and the love of my life. It is definitely a full
house. I have been doing artwork since I was a small child. That gives me
about 23 years of experience. I majored in art in high school and took a
few college art courses. Most of my work is done in either pencil or
airbrush mixed with color pencils. I have recently added designing and
creating artwork on the computer.I have been selling my art for the last 3
years and have had my work featured on trading cards, prints and in
magazines.I have sold in galleries and to private collectors from all
around the world.I am always facing serious difficulties when it comes to
selling my art works to Americans,they are always offering to pay with a
US POSTAL MONEY ORDER,which is difficult for me to cash here in
Netherland.
I am looking for a representative in the states who will be working for me
as a partime worker and i will be willing to pay %10 for every
transaction,which wouldnt affect ur present state of work,someone who
would help me recieve payments from my customers in the states.i mean
someone that is responsible and reliable,cause the cost of coming to the
state and getting payments is very expensive,i am working on setting up a
branch in the state,so for now i need a representative in the united state
who will be handling the payment aspect.
These payments are in money order and they would come to you in your name,
so all you need do is cash the money order deduct your percentage and wire
the rest back.
But the problem i have is trust,But i have my way of getting anyone that
gets away with our money,i mean the FBI branch in Washington gets involve.
It wouldnt cost u any amount,u are to receive payments which will be sent
to u by fedex or usps from my business patners, which would come in form
of a money order then u are to cash it and send the cash to me via western
union money transfer all western union charges will be deducted from the
money.
If you are interested,please get back to me as soon as possible.
Regards
Dayo Adams
