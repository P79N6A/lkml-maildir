Hi, 
I can't make TPM work on an IBM thinkcenter S51
running 2.6.12-rc5 kernel. Here is what I did:
1. build the drivers tpm.ko and tpm_nsc.ko and
modprobe tpm
2. create /dev/tpm
3. build tpm libtcpa (version 1.1)
4. run tcpa_demo 
then I got an error "Can't open TPM driver". 
I also tried tpm_amtel (though I believe mine is nsc)
and the same error too. 
Does anybody experience the same problem and have a
clue? 
thanks,
Gavin,
