Subject: [PATCH] free_irq(): Actually handle DEBUG_SHIRQ
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

 Code used for DEBUG_SHIRQ in free_irq() is unreachable -- the for() loop 
within never terminates otherwise than by return.  This is an obvious fix.

 Please apply.
 While at it, I have a question about the complementary code within 
request_irq(): when the option in question is enabled, a spurious IRQ is 
posted before internal setup is done by setup_irq().  This includes the 
->depth counter.  Now if the interrupt handler of some driver calls
disable_irq_nosync(), then code in setup_irq() will mess up the state of 
->depth afterwards if this is the first handler being installed (i.e. 
within the "if (!shared)" block).  This is reported later on when 
enable_irq() called by the driver, by means of a message like this:
Unbalanced enable for IRQ 34
WARNING: at kernel/irq/manage.c:158 enable_irq()
Now given DEBUG_SHIRQ is a debug facility, not to be normally used for 
production, is the phenomenon as described considered a design limitation 
we can live with, or is it a bug that qualifies for a fix?
 I can reproduce this problem easily with phylib.
