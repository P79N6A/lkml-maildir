Apparently we are doing synchronous writes. That would explain why
it is slow. We shouldn't be doing synchronous writes here. I'll see if
I can reproduce this.

Yes, I can reproduce the sync writes coming out of xfssyncd. I'll
look into this further and send a patch when I have something concrete.
Cheers,
Dave.
