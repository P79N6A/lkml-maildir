Well we stick a "/%d" at the end, which gets us up to 14 chars, assuming
NR_CPUS < 1000

Yup.  But it'd be fairly silly to go adding the /%d, only to have it
truncated off again.
We could truncate the name before adding the CPU number, but it sounds
saner to just prevent anyone passing in excessively long names.  Via
BUG_ON, say ;)
What's the actual problem?
