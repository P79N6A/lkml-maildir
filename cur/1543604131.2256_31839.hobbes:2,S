I think yes, more kernel threads need to use this function.  Most
particularly, threads which are parented by a userspace application
and which can terminate.  For example, the nfsd threads.
Right now, it's probably the case that nfsd threads will turn
into zombies when they terminate, *if* their parent is still
running.   But of course, most kernel threads are parented
by very short-lived userspace applications, so nobody has
ever noticed.
