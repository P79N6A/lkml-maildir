Hi all.
I've been seeing some funny bad_scheduling_while_atomic messages that might be 
my own fault (they only occur after suspending). The funny thing, though, is 
that they are all the same, and show a calling chain:
schedule_tail -> preempt_schedule -> cpu_idle
Am I misunderstanding this, or is a thread being preempted by cpu_idle? If 
that is the case, real work shouldn't be preempted to idle, should it?
