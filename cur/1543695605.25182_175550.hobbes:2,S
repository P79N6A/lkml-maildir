Hi.
When I attach a camera to a 2.4. based machine hotplug starts up some
script to download images of that camera and fine thats it.
In 2.6.0-testX I see kernel messages like:
hub 2-0:1.0: new USB device on port 1, assigned address 2
bus usb: add device 2-1
bound device '2-1' to driver 'usb'
bus usb: add device 2-1:1.0
bus usb: remove device 2-1:1.0
bus usb: add device 2-1:1.0
bus usb: remove device 2-1:1.0
bus usb: add device 2-1:1.0
bus usb: remove device 2-1:1.0
bus usb: add device 2-1:1.0
[...]
and several of these hotplug scripts get started... Is this a wanted
behaviour and something has to be fixed in userspace or is it a kernel
bug ?
