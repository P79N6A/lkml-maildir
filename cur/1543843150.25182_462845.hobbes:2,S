Subject: [-mm patch] AVR32: Make PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC imply PROT_READ
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The AVR32 MMU has three protection bits for allowing unprivileged
access, write access and execute access respectively. There is no
way to deny read access while allowing write or execute access.
make-prot_write-imply-prot_read.patch in mm does basically the same
thing for several other architectures. One important difference is
that this patch makes PROT_EXEC imply PROT_READ as well, but it looks
like this is the case for most other architectures already.
