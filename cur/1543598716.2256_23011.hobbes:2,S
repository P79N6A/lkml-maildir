I am using 2.4.8-ac7 on a Dual P3@450Mhz. The machine has two serial
ports. ttyS0 & ttyS2 are covered by the first with ttyS1 & ttyS3 covered
by the second. Now typically in /proc/interrupts only one serial port is
configured. The IRQs 3 & 4 are shared by the two ports. Its not consistent
which one gets which IRQ. Sometimes the first has 3 and the second 4.
Today the situation is reversed. This ofcourse is wreaking havoc on
setting my pilot for synchronization.
Is there a options that I failed to select while configuring the kernel?
Do I need to add an option to the boot via lilo?
I will do an idiot check by checking the bios.
