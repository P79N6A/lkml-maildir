I should have said 490030594 sectors or 245015297 KB, which would have
made it clearer, sorry.

Definitely the cause.  If you really need to add this array, you may
be able to reduce the usage of the array, then reduce the size of the
array, then add the drive.
Depending on how you have partitioned the array, and how you are using
the partitions, you may just need to reduce the filesystem in the last
partition, then use *fdisk to resize the partition.  Then something
like:
   mdadm --grow --size=243000000 /dev/md_d4
Is is generally safer to reduce the filesystem too much, resize the
device, then grow the filesystem up to the size of the device.  That
way avoids fiddly arithmetic and so reduces the chance of failure.
