Its an Inspiron bios bug - they fail to preserve the locked stat of the zip
drive across a suspend. Its not the worst bug in the world. In theory the
scsi/ide layer could use a PM notifier to check the locked stat is right
and force the drive into the right state. I'd take patches for it but lets
say its not high on my 'urgent problem' list
