Hi !
I am so glad to find somebody interested in this issue ;-)
I am not sure about which watchdog is working in the P8SCi. On my P4Sci, the 
working watchdog was the one in Intel's southbridge with the i8xx-tco driver. I 
tried to use this driver with the P8SAA. To do that I had to use 2.6.11rc2bk9 to 
get ICH6 support in the i8xx-tco driver. But as you may know, the watchdog is 
not working on the P8SAA.
This might be a good bet for you.
	sincerely,
