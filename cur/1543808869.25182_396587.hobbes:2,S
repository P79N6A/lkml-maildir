Except for mentioning some DMA related problems at the beginning of this
monstrous thread, you haven't shown anything which even remotely qualifies
as a bug.
You are only endlessly complaining about Linux not following the same
model of SCSI access as you love, which might be a little incovenient
for you, but that certainly doesn't make it a bug.
You tried to juggle with dubious POSIX references, but so far nobody has
found any place in POSIX or SuS saying that anything has to be stable
across mounts/umounts.
So what damned bugs are you speaking about?
				Have a nice fortnight
