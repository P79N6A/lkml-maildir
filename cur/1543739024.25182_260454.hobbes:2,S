It seems that way to me too. Long ago I implemented preemptible
RCU, but did not follow it through because I believed it
was not a good idea. The original patch is here :
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0205.1/0026.html
This allows read-side critical sections of RCU to be preempted.
It will take a bit of work to re-use it in RCU as of now, but
I don't think it makes sense to do so. My primary concern is
DoS/OOM situation due to preempted tasks holding up RCU.

I would be interested in this too.
