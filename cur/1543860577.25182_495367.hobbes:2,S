Hi Vivek,
Sorry for the delay, I'm just back from vacation. I tried it all again

I've shared the whole build tree so that you can peek at files without
waiting for me to upload them. It is temporarily available at:
  
http://jdelvare.pck.nerim.net/linux/relocatable-bug/
Hidden files are there too, just not listed.
Thanks,
