Wrong choice of words on my part, it's not unsafe, but you might get
kernel panic on a suficiently corrupted FS... But of course in that case
you're better of running fsck manually from a boot floppy *after* correcly
running hwclock anyways; so yes, run hwclock prior to fsck and forget it ;)

In any case, lets keep this in perspective, it is only for those people
that need to keep their RTC non-UTC to run less-capable OS'es.  These
people are likely to run linux off std. distributions.  I quickly checked
a Debian2.1 and a Redhat6.0 system at work, and both fsck root *prior* to
hwclock.  Most of these installs are also done into a single partition, so
the wrong time is potentially propagated to more files.
So it seems the bug is in the distributions' boot scripts and (mostly) not
a kernel issue.

All too true!
