I had the same error when I compiled a module without -D__SMP__ and tried to
load it into an smp kernel. The problem I faced was that spinlock_t is 8 bytes
for smp kernels and 0 bytes for up. Due to this size of zone_struct was
different in kernel and the module. Following check failed because of that.
extern inline struct page * alloc_pages(int gfp_mask, unsigned long order)
{
	/*  temporary check. */
	if (contig_page_data.node_zonelists[gfp_mask].gfp_mask != (gfp_mask))
		BUG();
Did you compile kernel and modules with mp config and then compiled kernel
only with SMP?
