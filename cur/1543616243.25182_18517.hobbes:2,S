I suspect this might be about as religious an issue as there is but has 
anyone thought about coming up with some "standard" debugging macros, 
perhaps something that can be configured at compile time from the 
configuration for everyone to use everywhere?  I've got my own debug 
macros,  essentially a printk with the file, function and line added 
wrapped in #ifdef DEBUG.  I've seen several other schemes in other parts 
of the kernel and now some of them aren't correct.
I guess what I would envision is some kind of debug menu item in the 
configuration tool that let's you select if you want messages, and/or 
filenames, and/or line numbers, and/or function names, or nothing at 
all.   They could still be controlled at the module level by defining or 
not defining some constant.   It just seems kind of pointless to have 
10-20 different macros or methods that all do the same thing for 
different parts of the kernel.
