Twice I've had my PCI S3 audio card go nuts on me. After some unknown
trigger, it can only make an initial 'pop' whenever opened (or first
written to?). This cannot be reset with rmmod/insmod. No errors are ever
logged, each insmod goes fine (except for the still not working part). 
A reboot is needed to reset the card, don't know if a warm boot works 
(never needed a reset button before).
Cursiously, it does make a series of pops as I slide the vol & pcm scales
in aumix, with each pop changing volume appropriately. With the
speech-synth
program Festival, strace noticed it would get hung up on close(), chewing
a lot of system time (top's term for kernel space work, right?). 
Both failures seemed to co-incide with using smpeg3.1, though I'd have to
reboot
more to be sure. 
I'm willing to perform mild acts of magic to diagnose this, such as
providing a card register dump (how?). I won't put my HD's at risk for
this, though. That counts out fooling with kernel 2.3.
