Hi all,
on our CPU's we have new DEC 21142? chips. I managed to let them go well
with tulip.c 0.91g but no way with standard 0.89h. 
for 2.2.12 I easily dropped 0.91g into the source but for 2.3.21 some
more work is needed. Is it scheduled or has someone else already done
the work ? otherwise I can do forward port 0.91g to 2.3.X.
maybe, future releases for the driver should use a unique driver with
suitable #ifdef/... 
regards.
