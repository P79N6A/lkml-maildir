    Well, Linux may stress the hardware more than other operating
systems because it tries to optimize usage and performance. But in
this particular case I will think you are very unlucky O:) I've seen
that before, unfortunately.
> Could a hardware failure look like bad sectors to fsck?
    Yes, depending on the hardware failure.

    You should use 'integrit' (
http://integrit.sourceforge.net
). I
use it to know whether a file whose contents shouldn't change has
changed, but it has more usages. And use memtest86 (there are two
versions out there) to check your RAM, just in case. Bad RAM can
cause 'apparent' hardware failures. A bad RAM chip can cause disk
errors (if you write to disk from *bad* RAM, you'll write *bad* data)
and other failures. Use 'integrit', read the documentation for
details.
    Good luck, you'll need it with that laptop :(
