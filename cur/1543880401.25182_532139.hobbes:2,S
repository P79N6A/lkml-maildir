Actually, this formula can't be used for the migration thread itself as 
its load_weight isn't an accurate reflection of its static priority. 
But as the migration thread is a real time task this probably isn't an 
issue, right?
If this assumption is correct (i.e. curr is never a real time task) then 
my earlier caveat re division by zero being possible is invalid because 
the migration task will never be the only task on the runqueue when this 
code is called.
I'm also assuming here that (because of its name) curr is already on the 
runqueue when this code is called.  If it isn't the divisor in the above 
expression should be (rq->raw_weighted_load + curr->load_weight).  This 
would also preclude the possibility of divide by zero.
