Every recent system I've turned the shadow copy off on won't boot any more.

That is a card specific problem that needs to be addressed in the
driver for the card. As long as the ROM is run the hardware will
correctly respond to commands asking it about the secondary heads.

Don't worry about multiple cards in a single system yet.

BenH has source for a working emu86. I would wait on that project
until klibc has been merged.

OpenGL is perfectly capable of doing 2D drawing as well as 3D. Check
out the profile option of OpenGL/ES. It has been proposed before to
chop mesa down into a smaller OpenGL/ES profile for system where space
is at a premium. There is a commercial minimum profile OpenGL/ES
implementation that fits in 100K.
I would leave accelerated 2D alone to begin with and I would remove
the fbdev 2D acceleration from any fbdev drivers that you merge. The
fbdev acceleration code conflicts with the DRM code. If you ask me,
there should be no in kernel access to acceleration of any kind.
Anything wanting acceleration would need to ask for it from user
space. More details on consoles and acceleration are in:
http://jonsmirl.googlepages.com/graphics.html
Merging and fixing the kernel graphics subsystem is a gigantic
project. My strategy would be to split it up into small steps and get
one step accepted at a time. Don't start writing code for the next
step until the first one is accepted. The number of changes you will
get on the first step will invalidate anything you do on the second
step.
A good first project would be to start building a set of user space
apps for doing the mode setting on each card. All of the code for
doing this exists in the X server but it is a pain to extract. X has
1000s of internal APIs and typedefs. You would end up with a set of
apps that would be able to list the valid modes on each head and then
set them. The code for achieving this is all over the map, sometimes
we know everything needed like for the Radeon, sometimes you need to
make a VM86 call to the BIOS to get the info (Intel). Load an fbdev
driver and check out the current support for this in sysfs.
When you get done with a command it should be a tiny app statically
linked to klibc and have no external dependencies. These apps should
be 30K or less in size. You probably will end up with about ten apps
since a lot of the uncommon cards only have a standard VBE BIOS and
will all use the same command.
You will also need to make a licensing decision. X and DRM are MIT
licensed and fbdev is GPL licensed. If you use any code from fbdev you
have to pick GPL for your license. This won't bother Linux but it will
bother BSD. I'm a Linux user and I've never booted BSD so I don't
care, but other people do.
