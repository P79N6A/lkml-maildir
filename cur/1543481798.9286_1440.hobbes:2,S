apmd3.0pre4 hangs up machine when called from rc.local
I put an echo msg before and after.
I can reboot with the 3 finger salute
When I do that I get two messages [104] [105] about apmd exiting.
Seems to be a vfork problem. When I remove the vfork code from
2.2.0-final by reversing the change in entry.S, all goes well.
