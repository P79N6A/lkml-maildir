I am led to believe that this is normal for CompactFlash. I seem to
recall that the phrase 'bogroll technology' was used by the last person
to attempt any serious testing.
It's fine for short-term storage of stuff like digital photos, but don't
try using it for long-term storage. Think of it like a floppy disc -- if
you have any _important_ data, make sure it's backed up or copied onto
at least three of them to avoid loss.
Not that there's any _fundamental_ reason why PCMCIA-ATA should be
completely unreliable, that just seems to be the way it's done.
Reliability costs, you see.
