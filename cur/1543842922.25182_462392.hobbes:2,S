This seems a bit.... late.
The patch adds a whole bunch of new extern-decls-in-C.  It'd be nice to get
those into a header file sometime.
And sparc64 allmodconfig broke.
kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x36834): In function `audit_filter_rules':
: undefined reference to `audit_classify_syscall'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Possibly because the audit git tree fell out of -mm ages ago, partly
because its owner (ahem) ignored my request to resync it with upstream.  I
have new scripts from Junio and shall try again.
