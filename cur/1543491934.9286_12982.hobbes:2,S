Proprietary? Funny, I thought it was freely available. Let's see
here... Aha! From the RPM HOWTO, conveniently linked from
http://www.rpm.org
:
"Permission is granted to use and distribute RPM royalty free under
the GPL."
All FSF arguments aside, that doesn't sound so proprietary to me. And
the www.rpm.org front page doesn't mention RedHat even once. So before 
you start spouting RedHat conspiracy theories like the Slashdot
freaks, maybe you could do a minute or two worth of research? Really,
a rant works much better if it's even vaguely based in fact.
