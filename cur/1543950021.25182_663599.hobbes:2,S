ARM6, ARM7500 and similar do exactly this for short (and unsigned
short), although not for int, long, or pointers:

becomes (arm-linux-gcc -mcpu=arm6):

note the two single-byte stores, as ARM6 didn't have the "store
halfword" instruction.
So I think Alan Stern's
"For all properly-aligned pointer and integral types other than long
long..."
should be amended to
"For all properly-aligned pointer and integral types other than short or
long long..."
