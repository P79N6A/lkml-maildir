hello
i think there is a bug in this patch
when i trie to open the cdrom bay with cdcd open, i get:
ioctl -1 returned
and when i use cdcd close, nothing happens
also, when i try to see some dvd, xine can not read the drive (cannot read
dev/dvd)
everything works ok with the previous (pre1) patch
greetings
erasmo
