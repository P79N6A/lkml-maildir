Personally, I like to buy tulip based cards. One you might easily get is
the KTI KT-320 (or was it KF-320? Both exist, one is el-cheapo, the good
one is at about 40..50 EUR or US-$).
Some time ago, I also used eepro100-based cards. But since Intel has
started to put these into their chipset (as it seems with some
additional silicone bugs, which freezes the box with eepro100, but not
with working-around Intel's e100 driver) I don't use them any longer...
MfG, JBG
