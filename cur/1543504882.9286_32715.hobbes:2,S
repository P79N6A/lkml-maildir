I'm pretty sure he has security options on, the standard kernel supplied
with RH6 has problems with the access permissions, notably the uid/gid
squashing and some other issues I can't remember right now.
I've had the same problem with the stock kernel, I solved this by
exporting world readable and not using RH6 / kernel 2.2 for machines that
need more security then that.

I am currently using 2.2.10-ac12 on the only production machine that runs
a 2.2.X kernel, I haven't tried permissions, but the NFS server and
client don't seem to fail for me, uptime over a week now and used by 20
people as home.
Reading this list I discovered that knfs is still being in a debugging
phase, so I think everyones mileage may vary depending on their
circumstances.

 There are three ways to get something done: (1) Do it yourself.
 (2) Hire someone to do it for you. (3) Forbid your kids to do it.
