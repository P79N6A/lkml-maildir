The problem with supporting 
  /dev/hda1   /mnt/windows   ntfs-3g   rw,...
type syntax in /proc/mounts is that it would add much more complexity
to the kernel.  The same could be achieved in userspace by teaching
the mount utility about special filesystems like ntfs-3g.
This patch aims for the minium footprint for a feature, that really
doesn't concern the kernel at all.
