    Nonsense.   GCC may be the best free C compiler out there, but it's
    certainly not the only one and it certainly wasn't the only one in
    1991.   If GCC wasn't around, one of the other free compilers would
    have been suitable for the job, unless you're actually stating that
    writing a compiler is such a grim horrible job that only a saint
    would sacrifice themself to do it.
