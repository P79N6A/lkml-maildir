That wasn't my design goal. The initial trigger for this was all the 64bit 
math in CFS and the question how can this be tuned using arch specific 
knowledge about the input values. For this I needed a correct and 
verifyable model to analyze, so I know where the limits are and how it 
reacts to different sets of inputs. This is where I got into trouble with 
all the rounding - I couldn't substantially change the math without 
convincing myself that it's still correct for all kinds of input data. 
That's why I completely redid the math from scratch - it's based on the 
same basic ideas, but the solution and thus the math is quite different.
The main reason I didn't concentrate on the behaviour so much is that 
since both scheduler are conceptually not that far apart, it should be 
possible to apply any tuning done to CFS also to my model. But this 
requires someone actually understands what tuning was done and it wasn't 
done by random changes and seeing what happens, i.e. someone should be 
able to explain it to me.
BTW in this context it's rather interesting to see that Ingo attacks me 
now for not having done this tuning yet and for which I explicitely asked 
for help...

Maybe he didn't understand it at all and is too proud to admit it?
(At least that's the only explanation which makes sense to me.)

Did I demand anything like that? It had been fine if he had been asking 
for more time or if he had more questions first, but it took him only a 
few hours to come to his conclusion without any need for further 
questions.

I don't think the math is that complex, it may need some more explanations 
outside the math formulas though. But the math is needed to analyze what 
effect changes to scheduler have, otherwise there is a risk it becomes 
only guesswork with random changes which may help in some situations but 
break others.
