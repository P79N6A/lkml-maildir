It isnt just an acorn problem. In fact the current EFI draft will mean it
even might bite you on a PC at some point in the future. All this requires
is you enforce the order, and maybe if someone really cares enough they
provide partition=hda,pc or some other setup option.
Finally the disallow other types on an Acorn machine isnt a practical option,
so it does need to be fixed. Acorn boxes use all kind of partition types.
