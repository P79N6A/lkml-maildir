I made page->reserve into PG_emergency and made that bit stick for the
lifetime of that page allocation. I then made kmem_is_emergency() look
up the head page backing that allocation's slab and return
PageEmergency().
This gives a consistent kmem_is_emergency() - that is if during the
lifetime of the kmem allocation it returns true once, it must return
true always.
You can then, using this properly, push the accounting into
kmalloc_reserve() and kfree_reserve() (and
kmem_cache_{alloc,free}_reserve).
Which yields very pretty code all round. (can make public if you like to
see..)
However...
This is a stricter model than I had before, and has one ramification I'm
not entirely sure I like.
It means the page remains a reserve page throughout its lifetime, which
means the slab remains a reserve slab throughout its lifetime. Therefore
it may never be used for !reserve allocations. Which in turn generates
complexities for the partial list.
In my previous model I had the reserve accounting external to the
allocation, which relaxed the strict need for consistency here, and I
dropped the reserve status once we were above the page limits again. 
I managed to complicate the SLUB patch with this extra constraint, by
checking reserve against PageEmergency() when scanning the partial list,
but gave up on SLAB.
Does this sound like something I should pursuit? I feel it might
complicate the slab allocators too much..
