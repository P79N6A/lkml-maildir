To be honest, you've asked the wrong question, so can I ask the
correct one for you?

To put that in context, a friend of mine works for a travel agent, and
his first language is Gaelic (the native language of Scotland), but he
has learned English in recent years. I showed him your message, and he
freely admitted that the latter example message was meaningless to
him. However, the former is of a form he is more than used to seeing
at work as WIndows 98 regularly displays messages of that form, and he
thus knows exactly what to do when he sees a message of that form.
Best wishes from Riley.
