AFAIK Fedora sets up the kernel command line with "root=LABEL=/" in
grub.conf and therefore needs the initrd in order to work correctly.
If you do not want an initrd, then change this to
"root=/dev/<your_disk>" in grub.conf. Note that the reason Fedora uses
the LABEL is so you can move disks around in your system without a
problem, so you should be careful doing so after making the change.
