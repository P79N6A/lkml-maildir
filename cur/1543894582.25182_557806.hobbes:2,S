That would be good.

I didn't say your old code was a hack. It just didn't work together with
the vmem map approach, so it had to be converted. Otherwise there wouldn't
be a 1:1 kernel mapping or struct pages for your memory region.
If you can write code that doesn't need any struct pages that would make
life a bit easier, since we wouldn't need any pseudo memory hotplug code
that just adds struct pages.
We would still need to add the kernel mapping though.
