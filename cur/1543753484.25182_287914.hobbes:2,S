Subject: [PATCH] fix INIT_SIGHAND warning on mips
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

sa_handler isn't the first member of struct sigaction on mips.
Use C99 initializers to avoid a compiler warning.  (There don't
seem to be more serious problems as mips worked with that warning
for ages)
