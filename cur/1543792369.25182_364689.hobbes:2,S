Subject: Future of DONGLE_OLD drivers?

Looking at drivers/net/irda/Kconfig, it seems all DONGLE_OLD drivers 
except EP7211_IR have more recent drivers.
My questions are:
Is there still any reason to keep the DONGLE_OLD drivers except 
EP7211_IR?
Is the Cirrus Logic EDB-7211 evaluation board still an actively 
maintained and supported platform or an obsolete platform?
TIA
Adrian
