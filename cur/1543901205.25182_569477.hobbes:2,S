Perhaps you could try updating your BIOS, if possible / applicable (?)

Hey, just try git-bisect already :-)
In fact, you can first try by just reverting / un-applying that patch that
you initially had a suspicion on. Or, because you've already spent
some time tracking down the issue, you could simply go through the
git history of that file / subsystem in question and play around reverting
individual patches that you find suspicious -- but really, there's no need
to try and be cute with this: you could simply do a git-bisect (say
between 2.6.20 and 2.6.21) and find the offending patch (or at least the
one that un-hides the bug) that makes the boot fail ...
[ BTW you haven't sent your dmesg / boot-time output ... if it isn't
getting saved to disk, you could try serial / netconsole, copy it by
hand, or simply take a photo and post it here. ]
Cheers,
