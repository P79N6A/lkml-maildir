I got this too running a similar load test.  My system is Intel PPro
200(UP) w/96MB ram. Kernel 2.2.0.  Gcc 2.7.2.3.  My scenario:
I had 10 processes chewing on memory (10mb each) and a
make "MAKE=make -j" zImage
This caused a bit of a slowdown :-)  When the smoke cleared they had all
exited with signal 7 or 9, dmesg showed a bunch of 'Out of memory for
process xxx' and top was stuck in __down_interruptible according to ps
-alx.
Note, during the heavy swapping period a few oddities arose:  for about
ten seconds in the middle, ALL disk I/O froze.  Then the kernel climbed
back on the horse and went on with it's business.  Secondly, as soon as
heavy swapping/context switching starts all process information becomes
unattainable through ps, top, or vmstat.  Additionally, at a certain point
when OOM was reached, ALL the memory eaters were killed.  This may have
been a side effect of the 'fork bomb' make -j though, which was entirely
unsuccessful at building my kernel.
