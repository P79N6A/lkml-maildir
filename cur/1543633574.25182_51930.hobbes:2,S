Just to chime in my support (not that I don't think anyone needs it), I 
think socket-based counters are An Extremely Bad Idea.  
They might be useful in some rather specific debugging scenarios (like 
100's on debugging printk's too!), but definitely not something we want to 
be cluttering the main tree with, _especially_ before they've shown their 
worth (doubtful).
