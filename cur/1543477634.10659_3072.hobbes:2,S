Writing something like that really makes no sense. The requirements are
clearly for Intel only (and I'm not sure if e.g. the 5MB limitation is
correct), so if you'd want to write something like that, you'd probably have
to list the ports and then for each platform list the minimum
requirements, or at least mention the ia32 requirements under some
Intel section. Also, I don't know where the 80MB comes from... that's just a
wild guess, I'd think.
On the other side, for a kernel announce it would be a good idea to list all
the ports, not just some. It is fairly easy to do ls linux/arch/

I don't understand why do you have to put numbers everywhere, especially
when they are incorrect. Linux happily runs on 30 CPU boxes, it might soon
run on 64 CPU ones as well, so why the 16 there. Of course, there are
several SMP bottlenecks to be worked out in 2.3+, but they just mean Linux
does not scale as much as it could on high end boxes.

Mentioning ROM fs is an implementation detail, I'd guess there are far more
much more important new things in 2.2 than this one (not that I'm not using
it for install floppies).
I'd think kernel press release should either give correct numbers, or none
at all.
Cheers,
