I use 2.6.0-test9 (preemptive) and an 8-button analog joypad plugged in my
SBLive gameport, so I load the following modules:
analog
emu10k1_gp
joydev
gameport
Joypad response in xmame and other apps (even jscal) seems a lot worse than
in 2.4 kernels; even with a low system load, a lot of inputs "get lost", in
the sense that I have to repeat the command two or three times before
actually seeing it accepted.
The same does not happen using a usb Sidewinder, and the appropriate
modules.
