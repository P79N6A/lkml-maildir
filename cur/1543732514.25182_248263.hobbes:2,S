This should be fixed in Nautilus, not the kernel.

Why do this in a tar file?  tar = "tape archive".  It isn't designed to
be a file system.  Sure, it's nice to have tools that make it easier to
access files in a tar file, but to this isn't a job for the kernel.

Please don't tell me that we have expectations to run make from within a
tar file.  This is getting silly.  tar does a pretty good job of
extracting files into real directories, and putting them back into an
archive.  I don't see a need to teach the kernel how to deal with
compound files when user space can do it very easily.
