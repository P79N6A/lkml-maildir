If the problem is that after a link/ISP failure some already stablished
connections or new connections use the cached route to go through the
failed link, you can make the kernel forget about any route caches it
currently has with the command:
# ip route flush cache
You can check the routing cache at any time with:
# ip route show cache
Hope it helps.
