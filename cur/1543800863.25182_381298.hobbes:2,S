Andrew,

The arch_remove_kprobe() prototype declaration in
include/asm-*/kprobes.h needs a forward declaration of "struct kprobe"
due to the order in which the kprobe.h files (include/linux/kprobe.h and
the arch specific ones) are included. Though other archs build fine,
the powerpc compiler throws out an error:
include/asm/kprobes.h:53: warning: its scope is only this definition or
declaration, which is probably not what you want
arch/powerpc/kernel/kprobes.c:84: error: conflicting types for
`arch_remove_kprobe'
include/asm/kprobes.h:53: error: previous declaration of
`arch_remove_kprobe'
make[1]: *** [arch/powerpc/kernel/kprobes.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/powerpc/kernel] Error 2

The patch that introduced kprobe_mutex instead of the spinlock had an
undesirable portion that passed a struct semaphore * as a parameter.
This obfuscates locking and will lead to hard to maintain code.

My understanding was that the preferred method is incremental patches over
the released -mm.

You are right. The patch in question fixes a build break and other issues
in the kprobe spinlock to mutex patch. And it is indeed better to redo the
patch with these fixes included. Does that sound reasonable?

Point taken :)
