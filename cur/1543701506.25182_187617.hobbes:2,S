	Sounds like you have buggy hardware. I routinely use GCC to try to break 
machines because it is so CPU/Memory intensive. Because of the massive amount 
of work gcc does, it will push out bugs/problems in your hardware. I would 
recommend you look into it further. Overheating? Bad memory? Byggy chipset? 
Cheap mobo?
	Even if the system *seems* stable, I wouldn't trust it. You may have a VERY 
subtle hardware problem if the system seems stable otherwise. A normal 
program might only crash 1/1000 times with MCE where GCC will do it 1/10. 
Check out your hardware then reply back if that doesn't fix it.
	I tried to look up the error code, but man those proccessor spec manuals will 
run circles around your head sometimes. The best I could come up with is that 
your processor should never return MCE ;) MCE indicates some pretty heavy 
trouble with data maniupulation.
