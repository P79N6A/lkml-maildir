No, *please* don't do this. Subarch for .c files is *broken*.
Last time I looked (and I don't think anyone has fixed it since) 
it requires copying files all over the place, making an unmaintainable
nightmare. Either subarch needs fixing first, or we don't use it.
Let's just stick with your original patch - it's fine.
