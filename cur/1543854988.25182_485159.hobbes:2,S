Well, there's a very good explanation for that. The server has nothing
but XFS file systems (well, /boot is ext3, but that doesn't get used
for anything but the kernel image and System.map file).

Using 8K stacks works arround the problem, so for now the above patch
may well make sense. But, it would be better to get XFS fixed rather
than start adding dependencies for 4KSTACKS - it might be troublesome
getting rid of it again.
