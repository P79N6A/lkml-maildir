Pavel,
You can't blame me for not doing these things, because I am not a maintainer.
However, you are, and you defend yourself so hard for that position, so if _you_ 
don't do these things, people complain.

Oh yeah? Let's check the archives:
"I seriously claim that STR _should_ be a lot simpler than suspend-to-disk, 
because it avoids all the memory management problems. The reason that 
we support suspend-to-disk but not STR is totally perverse - it's simply that
it has been easier to debug, because unlike STR, we can do a "real boot" 
into a working system, and thus we don't have the debugging problems that
the "easy" suspend/resume case has."

Maybe it's why he didn't like the STR design you had?
Maybe I am still wrong, maybe Linus is wrong too, but you can't attack me
not doing my homework.
