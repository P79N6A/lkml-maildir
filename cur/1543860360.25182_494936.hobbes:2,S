Subject: [PATCH 2/3] change libfs sb creation routines to avoid collisions with their root inodes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This changes the superblock creation routines that call new_inode to take steps
to avoid later collisions with other inodes that get created. I took the
approach here of not hashing things unless is was strictly necessary, though
that does mean that filesystem authors need to be careful to avoid collisions
by calling iunique properly.
