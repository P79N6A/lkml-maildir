You can refer the following books:
 Love Robert -- Linux Kernel Development (2.6.x kernel)
 Bovet,Daniel and Marco Cesate -- Understanding the Linux Kernel,Third Edition 
 Jonathan Corbet, Alessandro Rubini and Greg Kroah-Hartman -- Linux device drivers Third Edition.
I hope those books could give a mountain view about Linux kernel.

Subject: how to use the new wait functions in wait.c?
Looks like linux kernel switched to new wait function sets in wait.c.
But I cannot find any document about the new APIs. Can someone kindly
let me know where I can find them or let me know how to use them?
Thanks a lot!
