 the damage is done because "admin" rights are forced out of the control
 of the users and sysadmins and into the hands of the dumb-ass app
 writers, for both the setup stage and then the actual day-to-day
 usage of the app!
 the registry on NT has ACLs - which are completely irrelevant as far as
 users running as admin are concerned (because the dumb-ass app writers
 force them to).
 the nt registry - imagine it to be .... _like_ a filesystem, or _like_
 an LDAP server.
 except with proper ACLs and access controls [which everyone bypasses
 because duh it's windows duh, not because it's impossible to do a decent
 job with the API and its implementation].
