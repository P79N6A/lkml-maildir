Subject: PPP: VJ decompression error: on VC switch?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I am seeing lots of decompression error messages.  They seem to correspond
suspiciously well with virtual console switches.  When I switch VCs when
the link is saturated, I often get 8-12 of these messages in a row, about
2 a second.
Does anyone know why that could be?
Tim.
