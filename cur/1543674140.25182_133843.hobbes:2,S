What Alex didn't mention was the reason why we developed this patch in the
first place - speed.  Storing EAs in external blocks is slow, and if you
have a lot of inodes with external EAs it is fatal, as the EA blocks consume
so much RAM that they force all of the inode/directory data out of cache.
Some benchmarks (from Alex):

Some minor improvements could be made, such as not storing user EAs inside
the inode if there are system EAs that could be stored there.
Cheers, Andreas
