This paper tells about the "heuristic learning algorithm" used to park
the drives:
http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-53432
It seems that by IBM's calculations, desk-to-floor distance is
insufficient time to detect freefall and park the heads. So they
actually park the heads when it detects "starting to slide off table"...
Freefall detection: 300 ms
Head park time: 300-500 ms
  (from page 2 of document)
Still doesn't seem too bad to figure out how to code though, at least
once we can figure out how to get the data stream!
P.S. The main control system runs as a Windows kernel driver. Not as
safe as full hardware, but probably better than userspace. :)
