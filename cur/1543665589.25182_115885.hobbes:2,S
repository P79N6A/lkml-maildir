Hi All,
Some more tests...
In fact, it is related to the APIC stuff, not only the IO APIC part.
As it is working perfectly with a 2.5.63 kernel, I also gave a try
to a SMP config...
Result is the same...
Got :
Uncompressing .......
Now boot linux kernel ....
and then, booh... wait 5 to 10 seconds, and then the machine reboots...
Something went wrong from 63 to 64...
