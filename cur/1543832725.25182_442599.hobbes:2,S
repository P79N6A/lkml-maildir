It only breaks if it's being totally brain-dead and doing this:
	if (!strcmp(inputdev,"/dev/tty0") inputdev = "/dev/vc/0";
and not bothering to check that /dev/tty0 could *possibly* actually
appear in the /proc/tty entry.  In fact, it would have to be actively
asserting that it can't appear.
Code that does this sort of thing:
	if (!strcmp(procentry,"/dev/vc/0") procentry = "/dev/tty0";
	if (!strcmp(procentry, inputdev)) { whatever to to do when found }
will still work.

Oddly enough, "This PoS code only happened to work" is considered a good
and sufficient reason to fix kernel code. :)
Also, please note that I *did* agree with Alan - this needs to be done right
in /sys first, and then tools updated.  However, having provided a *correct*
way to do it, we should not *then* use "old crap might break further" as
a reason to not finish the cleanup.
