Hello,
what is the status of IrDA in the 2.4.0-test* kernels?
I am asking this because I am able to get reproducible hard
lockups with IrCOMM using vanilla 2.4.0-test8. However,
if I apply the patch-2.4-test6-irda3 from Dag Brattli's
site, all works fine (well, at least what I have tested),
so there is probably no need to report the exact data here.
Dag says in the Linux-IrDA mailing list, that he sent
the patch, but it has yet to be accepted, probably for
size reasons. Is this on the TODO list for 2.4? Search
for irda / ircomm in the l-k archive does not reveal
anything relevant.
Regards
