Leaving the standard aside, I think there is a bit of a problem in the 
idr code (.../lib/idr.c) which manages the id allocation.  Seems we 
are returning "long" from functions declared as int.  If I remember 
the code correctly this will work, but it does eliminate the sequence 
number that should be in the high 8 bits of the id.  This assumes that 
you never allocate more than 2,147,483,647 timers at once :)  I will 
look at this and send in a patch.  I think we should return what ever 
timer_t is, so we should run that to ground first.
I suspect we should also have a look at all the structures with a view 
to alignment issues or is this not a problem?  I.e. is this struct ok:
struct {
	long a;
	int  b;
	long c;
}
