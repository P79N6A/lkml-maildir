After some thought, I agree with this assessment.
It has been my goal for a long time to separate out the various chips 
from the tulip driver, for easier maintenance.  One of the reasons I 
have not applied a "fix tulip for ULi" patch is that it changes PHY 
details that I am not sure are OK for the myriad tulip clones.  A 
separate driver eliminates this objection.
I have applied your patch to the new 'uli-tulip' branch of git 
repository 
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git
Please now do the following tasks:
1) Submit an incremental patch addressing Alexey Dobriyan's minor complaints
2) Submit a patch removing all ULi support from the 'tulip' driver
I will then conduct a final review, and probably request another patch, 
with more updates.
After that, your driver will be sent upstream, to be included in the 
official 2.6.x kernel.
Thanks and regards,
	Jeff
