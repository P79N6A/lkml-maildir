Hi!
I tried to recompile 2.2.14 after I found out that I had to go to the
sound section to enable MSP3400 support, but this breaks
OSS/Commercial completely! It refuses to load if there is already a
soundcore module compiled for the kernel. Deleting soundcore.o will
allow loading OSS/Commercial (IIRC, I'm gonna check it again now with
2.2.15pre13) but msp3400 fails to load with unresolved symbols.
I just grabbed pre-patch-2.2.15-13 now and I see that MSP3400 is still
in the sound section.
So, please move msp3400 out of the sound section. As Gerd Knorr said
in <200001061829.TAA00686@macintoy.masq.in-berlin.de>, it does NOT
depend on soundcore if the kernel is compiled without sound, it just
breaks OSS/Commercial (and probably ALSA too).
