Hi:
    Did anyone ever test a single UDP echo server which is shared by
multiple UDP clients? Is it going to cause more packet loss or other
problems?
    I tried three clients which send 64 byte packet to the same server
at same time? But I can't prove the packet loss is caused by sharing the
server?
Thanks!
Tracy
