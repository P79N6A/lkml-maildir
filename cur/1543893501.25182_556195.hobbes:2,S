There's no 4 line limit for Kconfig entries. If it takes a 10 line 
paragraph for a short explanation what the NX bit is and when enabling 
NX support makes sense (because it will be used) then that's completely 
appropriate here. The same goes for the other parts.
The kconfig help should give anyone running "make oldconfig" a rough 
understanding what this option is about and a clear understanding what 
to answer for this option ("If unsure, say Y/N." is a standard text we 
use for the latter).
