An application might want to display quickly a set of images, not for
doing animations but rather displaying 'fake' greyscale images.

That's true for devices which have a frame buffer. But it's not your
case. You _emulate_ this behaviour and I can see big drawbacks to
this design:
  - You need to keep synchrone your buffer and the display every
    100ms. It makes your CPU busy even if nothing has been written in
    LCD for a while. Futhermore this kind of display is likely to run
    on embedded system where CPU speed can be less than 100MHz.
  - All accesses to the device depend on the previous behaviour whereas
    write(), read() syscall could be synchrone and easier to use for
    fast writing of image sets. Actually the refresh stuff is really
    needed only if you mmap the device. And it seems not really used
    for now since it was broken on your last patch.
  - Your driver _is_ a frame buffer driver by design, I think you
    don't need to seperate cfa12864cb.c and cfa12864cfb.c
So ok you code is very small with this design but IMHO it is not the
most polyvalent if you want to address all needs. Why not starting the
refresh stuff only if you mmap the device and keep the rest synch ?

maybe fb_ioctl() can return that. Or your driver can have its own
ioctl() method which could return such specific info.
