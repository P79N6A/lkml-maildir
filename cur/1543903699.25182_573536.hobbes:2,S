Using se.sum_exec_runtime to generate ->utime and ->stime breaks
the process accounting we have on s390 (and probably on PowerPC too).
With CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING we already have precise values in
->utime and ->stime. Can we make the calculation of the CFS-based time
values conditional by CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING?
