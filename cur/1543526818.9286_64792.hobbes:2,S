Hi James,
    Well, if i had to FTP the slack 6.0 , what are all the things i need to 
get, i would like the sources, not the binaries. I would like to compile the 
things myself. ( I have never tried it though ). Do i need the latest 
compilers, & libs. If yes where do i get them. Is kernel.org ( & its mirrors 
) the best place???
    I would appriciate if you could give me a list of the things i need to 
get, before i do anything. I have read through the kernel HOWTO's but i am 
quite unsure what exactly i need to get or to have to make things run fine.
    What is that glibc & how do i get it & is it required if i have to get 
myself to the latest kernel???
    Hope some one could help
Regards
Pavan
