The 2.6 tree is somewhat better about this but at the end of the day if
your I/O subsystem can't do the job your box will not perform ideally.
For some workloads its a huge win to have the extra RAM, for others the
I/O is a real pain. Also in some cases it might be interesting to try
using the extra RAM above the 4G boundary as a giant ram disk and using
it as first swap device.
I don't know anyone who explored that however
