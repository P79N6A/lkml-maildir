Yes. We would like to set 64BIT or not in other than x86 cases.
And way forward was not to override ARCH as in the x86 case.

I thought this was not possible but it must have been the limitation
of choice symbols I have hit when I played with it.

I will finish up your patch and target it for next merge window.
Thanks.

This is wrong considering the amount of people that hand edit the .config file.

Took a deeper look.
So we can have 4 different set of vlaues where the value indexed by S_DEF_USER
is the one that is actually used and the other three can be used to hold values.
I will try to document this in expr.h
Patch will be sent to you for review.

Do you have any suggestions how to properly fix this?
