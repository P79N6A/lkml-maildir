The key word here is "usually". If you're designing a system from the
ground up, you can have absolute failsafes for OOM - but only if
syscalls such as mmap and brk return ENOMEM for mappings which cannot
with 100% certainty be met. I'm sure people running simulations that
take weeks or embedded systems would also like such behaviour. And as
for fork(), I never did like the concept of cloning the entire process
only to replace it. vfork() is perhaps not elegant, but it does solve
the problem. Dare I mention NT has a "nice" way of spawning a new
process complete with specified file descriptor sets etc.
If you patch mmap/brk to return ENOMEM when they would overcommit and
then use vfork() instead of fork() for all your apps, you can guarantee
that once all memory is allocated they will never die unexpectedly. And
if they can't allocate memory in the first place, they can gracefully
take an appropriate course of action: inform the user, wait a few
minutes, or perhaps even quit (with an error return value saying why).
The exceptions here are read()/write() (and friends) which need to
allocate buffers - but you can specify a minimum buffer cache size, as
well as a few kernel reserved pages. And even then, you can wrap up your
read/write calls to take appropriate action... Or mmap() a file which
would contain the results, mlock() it into memory and write to that - no
need for buffers being allocated!
This is not as silly as it sounds. If you want a guarenteed stable app,
you at least want guarentees from the kernel. A way of turning on/off
overcommit per-process would be absolutely ideal for some of the things
I'm doing.
