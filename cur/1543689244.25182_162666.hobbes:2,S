To that part of the kernel interested in dirty pages, yes.
But when interested in futexes, it seems not.
If we're going to document a behaviour as depending on whether the user
said MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE, then it's VM_MAYSHARE we should check to
decide which behaviour to use.
We could use VM_SHARED, and document the behaviour of the futex as
depending on whether it's in an area that was MAP_SHARED from a file
which was opened for writing as well as reading - but do we really
want to complicate the documentation that way?   Principle of least
least surprise, principle of minimal doc.
