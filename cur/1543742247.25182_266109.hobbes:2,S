Thats odd.  Actually, I'm not sure what the "async" option is meant
to do, it isn't seen by the fs afaict (XFS isn't looking for it)... 
we also use the generic_file_llseek code in XFS ... so we're not
doing anything special there either -- some profiling data showing
where that CPU time is spent would be insightful.

You may get better results using a version 2 log (mkfs option)
with large in-core log buffers (mount option) for these (which
mkfs version are you using atm?)
cheers.
