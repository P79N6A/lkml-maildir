We already do that. It's not enough. The HT thing will still steal cycles 
continually, since the "rep nop" is really only equivalent to a 
"sched_yield()".
Think of "rep nop" as yielding, and "mwait" as a true wait.
(I don't actually have any real information on "mwait", so I may be wrong 
about the details on the new instructions. They looked obvious enough, 
though).
