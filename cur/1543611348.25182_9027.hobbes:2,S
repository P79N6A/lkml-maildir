Well, I gave that a try.  
note:
/dev/md0 is a 180 GB reiserfs on software RAID 5.
/dev/hda9 is an 18 GB reiserfs on a normal partition.
System is a dual PIII-800 with 512 MB RAM.
Kernel is 2.4.16 + Andrew Morton's Low Latency and I/O 
scheduling patches.
before:
cat /proc/sys/vm/max-readahead:	31
dbench 32 on /dev/md0  :	8.11 MB/sec
dbench 32 on /dev/hda9 :	24.85 MB/sec
after:
echo 1023 > /proc/sys/vm/max-readahead
dbench 32 on /dev/md0  :	8.047 MB/sec
dbench 32 on /dev/hda9 :	24.65 MB/sec
So that change actually made things a little worse,
at least on this kernel.  :-(
