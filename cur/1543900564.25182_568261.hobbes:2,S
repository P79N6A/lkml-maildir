Hm, it seems that the class device's kobject is not set up correctly
(at least, not its name) when make_class_name() is called. Might be
that it is unregistered before it has been added completely (at least,
before kobject_set_name() has been called).

Turning on verbose driver core messages (CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER) while
leaving on CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED may also be worthwile.
