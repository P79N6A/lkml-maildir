You also "fixed" my assertion that snapshot-origin "base device" (parameter 
n.1) must be a DM device. Should I readd it too?
IIRC I checked the code and it looks up the first param as a DM device, even 
because the list of snapshot is maintained for DM devices, not for general 
block devices.
Right?
