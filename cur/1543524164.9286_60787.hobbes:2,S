I meant nchunks=2, nleft=0. Btw, the value you reported could occur only
if the userspace passed nfds=2G-512,2G-511,...,2G-1, but that should have
been caught by the clause:
  if (nfds > current->files->max_fds)
                return -EINVAL;
So, it is still an open problem; I will try to see what may go wrong but
any extra data (especially strace output containing calls to poll(2))
would help greatly.
Regards,
Tigran.
