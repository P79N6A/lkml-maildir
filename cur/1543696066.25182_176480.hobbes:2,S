Interesting. The 2.4.22 sequential "per char" results are totally out of
line with anything else.
The thing is, the overhead for the per-char stuff really should be almost 
all in user space unless I'm mistaken. It's just using getch/putch, no?
Which makes me suspect that either the libc does something different
depending on kernel version, _or_ 2.4.22 returns a different st_blksize
thing, causing stdio to use a different blocking size.
Have you tried stracing the "per char" parts of the benchmark to see what 
the system call patterns are? That should show both effects.
