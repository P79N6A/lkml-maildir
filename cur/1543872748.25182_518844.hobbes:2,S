Certainly appropriate content for something on your website, and vendors who
provide programs like dmidecode and parsemce are always welcome. I could
probably be convinced that such info should have at least a pointer somewhere
in Documentation/lsi_debug.txt or some such.  But quite frankly, if I'm reduced
to wading through *.h files to figure out what some recalcitrant hardware is
upset about, there's been a failure in documentation.  *ESPECIALLY* if I
go look at drivers/whatever/source.c and it doesn't even *reference* the *.h
file in question.

Feel free to include mpi_inb.h when you submit the interface for merging.
