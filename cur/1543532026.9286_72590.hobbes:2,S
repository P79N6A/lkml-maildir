Hello,
I tried your patch, and I also compiled pre2 with pre3/7 prepatch. You
know, your case is pretty interesting :)
pre3/7 works perfectly, as it is the latest patch with the LDK1.1.2 code.
After adding the code between #if 1 and #endif, and also the single line a
bit farther, everything started to work. But after investigating that it
should display some descriptor %i errors, I don't see any! I don't seem to
get any message in /var/log/dmesg, so I tried putting a single
printk(KERN_ERR "blah"); just after the if loop (to check where it's
written), and I saw a lot of "blah"'s on screen. (I'm testing this with
via-rhine compiled as a module; much faster to test changes).
dmesg | grep Descriptor says nothing too.
Result: Like you said, it seems that by doing the "if" instruction, the
old value doesn't get wiped. The inside loop doesn't ever get run!! It's
weird, because it may suggest that the system runs too fast or
something.. like if the value wasn't written in memory.. but it's weird
since cpu_to_le32, after investigation, is only a way to swap between the
higher and lower 16-bits (I don't have much experience in kernel
coding/debugging).. or we'd have to wait after a timeout, but what
timeout?
It could be a bug in GCC 2.95.2, a bug that does an optimization
wrongly. I'm using this compiler. I haven't tested with egcs-1.1.2 yet
(and I don't have GCC 2.7.2.3 compiled at all)
My K6-2/450 isn't overclocked, runs at 100MHz bus speed at 4.5x.
