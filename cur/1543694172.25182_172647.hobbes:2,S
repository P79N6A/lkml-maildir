Well, you are right; functionally speaking, there are no concerns,
however, there are problems.
Not all architectures have really simple atomic operations like
for example, ia32 or PPC. For example, Sparc has to do this ugly 
spinlock thinguie and that's why you can only count on 24 bits 
out of the whole atomic data type; another example is ARM,
you just disables irqs and preemption, I guess, and operates), there
is no way they will work in user space
When you have implementations like this, where ia32 is one of the 
lucky exceptions because you can do it with a couple of asm opcodes,
it is really impossible to offer something that can float up to
user space.
