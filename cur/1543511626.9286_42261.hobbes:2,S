IMHO it's not possible to lockup a machine due OOM using an userspace
application. This because userspace will be swapped out or will generate
faults and you'll get a SIGKILL before you'll have filled all the memory
with vmas.
The network instead doesn't run from userspace and data structures gets
allocated per irq demand and you can't kill the source of the memory
allocation as it's not on your machine.
