well, deadlock detection happens at lock-acquire time, so the deadlock
will be detected _first_, any PI spinlock-locking will happen on already
blocked (== no deadlock detected) tasks. This would also serve as a nice
secondary check for the deadlock detector.

agreed.

well, blocking on a mutex happens quite frequently. But i dont have a
problem with the big lock other than the usual "if we can do better then
we should do better" attitude :-)
