[snip original discussion thrashing swap on 2.6test with 32mb ram]
Chris
By an unusual coincidence I was looking into the patches that were supposed to 
speed up application startup and noticed this one was merged. A brief 
discussion with wli suggests this could cause thrashing problems on low 
memory boxes so can you try this patch? Applies to test11.
