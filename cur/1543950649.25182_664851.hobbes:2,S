Not exactly - when rebooting through EFI or BIOS, the old code didn't
go through mach_reboot_fixups(), and I think that is the correct
behavior (albeit, when the EFI path fell back to the triple fault
mechanism, it should have honored the fixup logic, and I think it is
more correct that the new code tries the keyboard method first).
Perhaps the most reasonable way to go is to honor all reboot=
settings without using the override code first:

(with the exception that reboot=keyboard will still have the effect
of honoring the fixups, but I think this is better than further
complicating the logic).
