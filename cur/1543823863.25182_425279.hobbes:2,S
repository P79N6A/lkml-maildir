Yeah, the PCS bit is sad to look at.  From ICH6, the docs say that the 
AHCI SStatus should be used for presence detection but that cannot be 
done without AHCI BAR mapped.
ICH7 (or 6 was it?) added a window register into AHCI area, which 
weirdly cannot be used without actually enabling AHCI BAR - what's the 
point?  My suspicion is that they designed it to work without AHCI BAR 
enabled but maybe some revisions screwed up and ICH7 still had PCS 
presence bits working, so the weird result.
I don't have ICH8 docs but, again, my guess is that they've got the 
window register correct this time and determined to screw PCS presence 
bits.  All these suspicions and guesses need verification, but if my 
guesses are right, the solution would be...
* leave anything order than ICH6 as it is now
* trust PCS presence bits for ICH6/7
* use AHCI window register to access SStatus on ICH8
