Hi all,
i'am having a problem with this isdn card, sometimes, when the 
connection is working hard i get the message "W6692 IRQ LOOP"
and the isdn system gets blocked, i have to reboot the box to get it to 
work again (statically compiled driver).
I take a look to the driver's source and i found the reset procedure 
used in this case is a lot different from the procedure used in the function
resetW6692 so, without too much knowledge of kernel programming nor C, 
i've copied the code from the resetW6692 function to this point and i 
got it working.
