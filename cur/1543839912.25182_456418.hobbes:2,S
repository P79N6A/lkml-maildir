Sounds reasonable. May actually be close to what Patrick and I had in
discussion (I cant find my notes) i.e hashinfo would contain
table{size,index,mask,lock, and pointer to table}
After staring at the code for a minute, I think the challenges you may
face are in the conversions of: tcf_ {dump_walker(), del_walker() and
generic_walker()}
Thanks for taking this up Dave. And if you get it started and get
distracted somewhere, I could take it over.

act_police deviates from the generic layout; the intent is to allow for
that. The desire was/is for usability for whoever uses the generic
layout (read: joe-netfilter) could write a single page of code quickly
to do something powerful (like gact for example). It is turning out code
augmentation is not such a practical idea in the kernel.
