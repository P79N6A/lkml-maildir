Why do you need this?

This is fine, although I do wish you wouldn't number the exception labels.
If anything is changed, someone might try to rearrange and renumber them
and that leads to bugs.

What in the world is this supposed to do? Under what conditions can
result be zero here?
Personally, I would get rid of the printk. If your modprobe fails,
it's a good enough indication. Or at least, change the text to
something more neutral, like "unable to initialize (%d)" and print
the error code. It's not just about workqueues now.
