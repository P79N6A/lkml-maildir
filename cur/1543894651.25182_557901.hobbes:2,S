So we are violently agreeing, then?
This sub-thread started by me showing that:

This is a somewhat crude measure but it shows that only about 30% of the 
kernel is "v2 or later" and those pieces could be used on some other "v2 
or later" project (including v3). But the kernel as a whole is v2 and my 
point was that the claim that there are just a few "v2 only" files was 
bogus.
