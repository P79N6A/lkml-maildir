Ok, thanks Ivan/Russell for clearing this up for me.
If/When x86 (or all?) architectures use this, will it make sense to
remove the PCI space cache line setting from drivers ?
Or is there borked hardware out there that require drivers to say
"This cacheline size must be xxx bytes, anything else will break" ?

Davej.
