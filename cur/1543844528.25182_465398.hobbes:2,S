Oh, wow.  I had no idea there was a workaround.  What kind of
performance hit does that entail?  R200 performance is pretty dismal to
begin with, but it would be awfully nice to not have all our
workstations crashing all the time...
I wonder why that works.  What chipset do you use?  All our machines are
AMD 8151.
I'm about to leave town for several days, but I'll try that when I
return.
