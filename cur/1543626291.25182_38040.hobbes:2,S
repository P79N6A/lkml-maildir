"I'm distrustful of projects that do not have well-defined goals, and
 well-defined interfaces.  They tend to bloat and do "everything" over
 time.  This is what gives us horrors like GNU emacs and Mach: they
 don't try to do one thing well, they try to do _everything_ based on
 some loose principle" (Linus Torvalds, 26 Mar 1998)

"First off, I don't like a lot of the elitism that does on among Linux
 hackers.[...] If you think using Un*x makes you some kind of super
 genius who should be feared by mere mortals and
 end users, either get over it or start using *BSD. *BSD users (and
 developers) are all complete jackasses, so you'll fit right in."
