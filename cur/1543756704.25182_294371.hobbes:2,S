It's not a perfect fit, I'll readily agree.
But consider this: with RLIMIT_RTPRIO, I can restrict a user to the
lowest N RT priorities. Then at N+1, I have an RT watchdog taking care
of runaways, tickled by a SCHED_NORMAL task. So it can still be looked
at as a meaningful limit, just a bit different from the others.
The RT LSM gives full CAP_SYS_NICE out, so there's no way to guarantee
that the watchdog has higher priority.
