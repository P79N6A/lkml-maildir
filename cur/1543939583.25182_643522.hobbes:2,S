Hi!
I have just updated my server to 2.6.24 and the dl2k driver has stopped
working.
The problem seems to be when autoselecting the media, the driver says that
the card is set as "Auto 1000 Mbps, Half duplex" instead of the usual "Auto
1000 Mbps, Full duplex", I have tried setting "options dl2k
media=1000mbps_fd" but that didn't seem to change anything (the driver still
said "Auto 1000 Mbps, Half duplex").
I've been playing with ethtools and got it to work at 100FD by setting it
manually, but if afterwards I set it to auto it again goes 1000 HD and thus
not working again.
I'm not getting any special messages from the kernel, the ifconfig shows
this when the card is failing:

The machine is a PIII with a via chipset and the card was working perfectly
at 2.6.23 and before.
If you need any more info don't hesitate to ask.
