IIRC, there have been some reports on lkml regarding data/fs corruption in combination with
SIL 3112 (both IDE and SATA drivers) and Seagate drives.
searching lkml archives leads at least to
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108766862501122&w=4
(this report is based on 2.6.5/2.6.7)
maybe Jeff Garzik can comment more on these problems. I'm not sure, if
these probs are supposed zo be fixed in recent kernels.
cheers.
