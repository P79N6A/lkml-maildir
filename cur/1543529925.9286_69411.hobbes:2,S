i've introduced atomic_inc_local() and atomic_dec_local() to implement
'local-CPU-IRQ atomic' increments and decrements. The following increment
which you are using:
	current->blah--;
is not theoretically local-IRQ-safe, because the compiler is free to
reorder this with other lines. (and thus those other lines could get
possibly moved into the 'freely preemptable' area, causing subtle
small-window bugs.)
the following is safe as well:
	barrier();
	current->blah--;
	barrier();
but i just felt we want to make it IRQ-atomic as well (although this is
not strictly necessery now as IRQ contexts never change current->blah.) If
current->blah is modified from IRQ contexts as well then 'current->blah--'
is not IRQ-safe as it might get compiled into several instructions:
	movl blah, %eax
	decl %eax
	movl %eax, blah
although this does not happen on x86 currently, it could theoretically.
But your version is definitely buggy because it lacks a compiler-level
barrier. (which atomic_dec_local() automatically is)
