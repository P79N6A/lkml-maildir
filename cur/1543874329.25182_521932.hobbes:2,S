That's not proof, it is handwaving.  I could wave right back at you and
claim that the benefit from returning a cache-hot pte page back to the page
allocator for reuse exceeds the benefit which you waved at me above.
You may well be right, but nothing is proven, afaict.

Yep.  It's possible that process shutdown is a sufficiently common and
costly special-case for it to be worth special-casing.

No, these are unrelated.  We can get pte pages from the page allocator and
zero them without touching the munmap handling.
But it's possible that if we _were_ to optimise the munmap handling as
suggested, the end result would be superior.
