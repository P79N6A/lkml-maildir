If we did that, then people would use it.  And that would be bad.  It'll
lead to code which behaves differently on non-preemptible kernels, to code
which works less well on non-preemptible kernels and it will lead to less
well-thought-out code in general.
Really, this all points at an ill-designed part of the leds interface.  The
consistent pattern we use in the kernel is that callers keep track of
whether they are running in a schedulable context and, if necessary, they
will inform callees about that.  Callees don't work it out for themselves.
