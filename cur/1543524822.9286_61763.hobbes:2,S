i've tried, but with the same result. i can't go online, but now also
under the 2.2.14.
when i try it, comes following message:
-
/usr/sbin/pppd: no device specified and stdin is not a tty
-
i also try to compile ppp as a module an alias ppp to ppp_async in
conf.modules. the result was the same message.
