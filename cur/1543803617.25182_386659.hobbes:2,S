Hello,
I realized two things when I was porting my small script oops2line
to x86-64. (read call trace, find correspondance modules, calculate addr
and addr2line)
If I'm missing something, please let me know.
a) On x86-64 we get different Call Trace format than other architectures
   when we get oops or press SysRq-t:
   <ffffffffa008ef6c>{:jbd:kjournald+1030}
   There is a architecture independent function print_symbol().
   How about using it on x86-64? But it changes to:
   [<ffffffffa008ef6c>] kjournald+0x406/0x578 [jbd]
b) I can't find useful usage for the symbol size in print_symbol().
   And symbolsize seems to be fixed when vmlinux or modules are compiled.
   So we can calculate it from vmlinux or modules.
   How about removing the field of symbolsize in print_symbol()?
   [<ffffffffa008ef6c>] kjournald+0x406 [jbd]
