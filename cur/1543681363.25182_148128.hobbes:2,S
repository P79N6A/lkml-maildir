I have been doing some real (workstation-class) work with Debian Sid and
2.5.x kernels with great success for a while now. The only problem I had
so far was starting at 2.5.74, when DM/LVM2 ioctl version changed, and
my current Sid device mapper tools are not still up to date (and
compilation of LVM2.0.0 from sources fails).
Hope this helps.
