I have a dual celeron machine, and am having problems with 2.2.X.  The problems
being that programs appear to be using almost half of my total processing
power, when they really should not, which is strange.  Now the interesting
thing is that this problem does not occur in 2.3.X.  
When I boot 2.2.15pre4:

That is the output of top.  All my monitoring applications report around 80% cpu
utilization, when none of those things really use that much processing power.
I don't know if this is my hardware, which I don't think it is, because I've
talked to at least two other people who have this problem, and it does not do
this when I boot with 2.3.47pre6 (I get near 0% - 3% utilization at idle,
which is really what it /should/ be).
So if anyone could shed some light, or information, I'd appreciate it.
Regards,
Patrick.
