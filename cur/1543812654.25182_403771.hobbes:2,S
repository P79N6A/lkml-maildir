Since the patch you sent me didn't apply cleanly to the mm kernel I made the
changes by hand. This is what I ended up with (should be the same end result
as what you intended as far as I can see) :

Unfortunately that didn't fix it. After booting the patched kernel I found
this in dmesg :

Let's see what happens.
I've applied it on top of the changes mentioned above - let me know if 
that's wrong.

I'll try that after booting with the patch you just supplied and let you 
know the results shortly.
