Not that I'm aware of, but that does not mean they don't exist. Until
yesterday, I even thought that it was never implemented. As most other
systems don't implement it, the applications, if they exist, are Linux
or BSD-dependant. It's even difficult to use because the two ends must
loop around the connect() call until it succeeds, because as long as
they're not both trying to connect, they get RSTs back.

In doubt, I consider that they might exist. It's just like martians :-)
