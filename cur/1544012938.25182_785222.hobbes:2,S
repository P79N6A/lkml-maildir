I did not tested it very much, but xfs is around 1.1M on disk, and ~750K when 
loaded. I think it breaked being 1/4 through the relocations.

Sure. I'll respin the patch.

Yes, good.

BTW, although the comment states that arches can change section sizes 
in the module_frob_arch_sections() function:
/* Allow arches to frob section contents and sizes.  */
it will break horrible if you do so.
What I found was, that if you change sh_size, at least the module
references / dependency chain will break when running lsmod.
