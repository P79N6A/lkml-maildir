I am NOT wrong. I have crt startup code and if you actually CALL
the value in %edx, you __will__ segfault. So do a bit of research
before you claim that I'm wrong. Newer versions of the 'C' runtime
library simply fail to call that pointer in atexit(), before exit()
is called.
These things are so easily checked. Just assemble and link this code
against your favorite shared library.
#
#	This is the entry point, usually the first thing in the text
#	segment. The SVR4/i386 ABI (pages 3-31, 3-32) says that upon
#	entry most registers' values are unspecified, except for:
#
#   %edx	Contains a function pointer to be registered with `atexit'.
#   		This is how the dynamic linker arranges to have DT_FINI
#		functions called for shared libraries that have been loaded
#		before this code runs.
#
#   %esp	The stack contains the arguments and environment:
#   		0(%esp)			argc
#		4(%esp)			argv[0]
#		...
#		(4*argc)(%esp)		NULL
#		(4*(argc+1))(%esp)	envp[0]
#		...
#					NULL
#
.section .text
.global _start
.type	_start,@function
_start:	call	*%edx
	pushl	$0
	call	exit
.end
It works, i.e., exits without any errors with the ld-linux.so that
exists on all my systems except the Red Hat 9 system.
On the Red Hat 9 system, it will segfault.
Cheers,
