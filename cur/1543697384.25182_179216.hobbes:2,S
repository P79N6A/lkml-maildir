Hi Markus,
Thanks for testing. That sounds quite remarkable, is it possible that
some other change has made the difference? What kernel version did
you patch against, and did you try that same kernel and .config without
my patch? Anyway, I'm glad you're having good results.
Yes, this one will probably apply to test10 should it ever apper. If not
I will port it.
Nick
