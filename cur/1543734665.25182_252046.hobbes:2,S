Obviously I can't comment on the problems you're seeing with those due
to the lack of details.  However, last time I built a pure bk-based
tree (4 days ago), the following worked:
- ebsa110
- netwinder
- imx
- integrator
- lubbock
- rpc
- s3c2410
- versatile
However, many of these have sub-classes of either cpus or machines,
and running allnoconfig against these will again generate invalid
configurations.
So:
$ make netwinder_defconfig
$ make
will build a working kernel.
