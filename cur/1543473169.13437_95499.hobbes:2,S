Anyone could and someone probably would file a lawsuit against FSF
asking the court to block the change in meaning, relying on the language
in section 9 of GPL v2:
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  >>Such new versions
will
be similar in spirit to the present version,<< but may differ in detail
to
address new problems or concerns.
