So here is an updated patch. Notice that I've removed the
redundant COMMAND_LINE_SIZE from param.h of i386 to make it
closer to other architectures. It was required in the past
to allow a boot loader to know the COMMAND_LINE_SIZE, but
LILO, GRUB, syslinux have a local definition for this, and
is not required in boot protocol >= 2.02 since a boot loader
can pass any null terminated string.
