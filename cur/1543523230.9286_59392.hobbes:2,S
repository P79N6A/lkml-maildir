You'd do it anyway at the expense of other pages, if it improves
performance...  The reason it might improve performance is that you do
the zero-fill in otherwise idle time.  So you get getter overlap with
I/O.  In theory.
And on a multiprocessor system one idle processor can zero pages while
the other is consuming them.
For similar reasons it might be worth pre-copying COW pages.  I don't
know if that's at all plausible.  It's a pretty similar thing to
pre-emptive swap-in.
Perhaps you'd do the freepages.min pages -- pre-zeroed pages are quickly
reclaimable after all.
