Two reasons: security and robustness.
1. sysreq must work, always work. Ideally you even do the dump
in hard irq. USB has been modified to support this.
2. A true SAK key must be processed in kernel space
There are additional reasons that make it nice to have a kernel driver,
but these reasons make it necessary.

It does not support all features it is supposed to without that module.
There's nothing preventing you from using uinput if you want to. But full
function needs a kernel driver, either statically compiled or as a loaded
module.
