I hope I'm not missing the point. But let's put things into perspective:
	The computing industry has been around since World War II when
	the US spent tons to build computers to break German code. (I
	know about Babbage, I'm talking about modern computing devices).
	So, that gives us, roughly, 50 years.
	
	Since then, we have gone from monster machines which occupied
	whole buildings to fast computers which fit in the palm of your
	hand.
	In the last 30 years alone we have seen the advent of home
	computers and embedded devices. In that time, they have become
	more and more powerful and use less and less energy.
So, I'm simply saying that, while looking into my crystal ball, the vast
majority of people in 2038 will be running 64-bit machines and that OS
support for 32-bit machines will hold the similar facination that support
for 16-bit machines does today.
Support for embedded systems is another matter. From what I understand
about embedded systems (which isn't all that great yet), you need a
special OS for them. If an ES needs to tell the time after 2038 and is
still running a 32-bit processor, then perhaps they should patch the
kernel themselves or recalculate the epoch (which has been suggested
before)?

There are people offering support for [234]86s?

And I too have a computer which is 3+ years old. But I'm not kidding
myself in believing that it will fill my needs for the future.
