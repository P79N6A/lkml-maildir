That isn't related to "dynamic attributes", right?

That "problem" is actually a good thing. If you look at the change
rate of the internal kernel API, it saves us so much trouble. Like in
this case, James can just add a callback without caring about any
(almost :)) of the current users.

I think we should move in the opposite direction. You are right, it
isn't neccessarily pretty, but having encapsulations like this saves
us a lot of trouble while interacting with so many other people and
extending API's all the time. It's a trade, and it's a good one, if
you need to maintain code that has so many callers, and  so many
architectures, you can't even check that you don't break them.

Again, I don't think, that we want to get rid of the struct container
housing all the parameters and beeing open for future extensions
without changing all the callers.

What do we get out of this constification compared to the current code?
Thanks,
