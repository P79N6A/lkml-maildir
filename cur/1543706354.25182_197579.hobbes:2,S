You could go through the block devices in /sys and check if it is
attached to a pci card from one of the ataraid vendors...?

Nope.

Well, if the device is used by DM at least you cannot mount it anymore
(because it is bd_claimed), but still see and access it via open and
read.

I have a really bad idea :)
Try to combine it with udev. udev calls the ide script, the ide script
then calls the ataraid detector. If the device is non-ataraid, go on as
usual. If it is, build the device-mapper device and symlink (if it
doesn't already exist) and tell udev to not create anything.
