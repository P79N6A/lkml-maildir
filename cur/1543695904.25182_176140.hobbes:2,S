aargh.  I thought Debian's 2.6 kernels were unmodified.  Are they carrying
any other changes?

That _should_ work.  The pagecache pages should be in such a state that all
buffers are freeable and yes, we can leave the pagecache there.  But this
could cause problems if the device was repartitioned in between, or if it
was hotswapped.  I don't think we shoot down pagecache anywhere else for
this.
truncate_inode_pages() will unconditionally remove the pages from
pagecache: they're gone.  So if some poorly behaved piece of code
(reiserfs's read_super_block()) holds a reference against a buffer, that
piece of code ends up owning the page - the VFS has lost interest in it.
This is almost always very bad - if truncate_inode_pages() against a
blockdev fails to cleanly remove all pages then it often means memory
leakage or data corruption.  I would like to have a warning which detects
this case but I never got around to it.
