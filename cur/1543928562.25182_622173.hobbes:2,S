However things are implemented completely differently now.  I don't think
the coherent hypertransport domain of AMD processors actually routes
ExtINT interrupts to all cpus but instead one (the default route?) is
picked.
So I think for the kdump case we pretty much need to use an IOAPIC
in virtual wire mode for recent AMD systems.
For current Intel systems I believe either scenario still works.

It's worth a look.
I still think we need to just use apic mode at kernel startup, and
be done with it.
