What I meant is e.g. 
	f1();
	f2();
both f1 and f2 use the same stack memory, but f2 uses it uninitialized,
then I think valgrind would still think it is initialized in f2 from the
execution of f1. It would only detect such things in f1 (assuming there
were no other users of the stack before that)
In theory it could throw away all stack related uninitizedness on each
SP change, but that would be likely prohibitively expensive and also
it might be hard to know the exact boundaries of the stack.
BTW on running a test program here it doesn't seem to detect any uninitialized
stack frames here with 3.2.3. Test program is

(should be compiled without optimization)
