Why restrict it to Intel only? I don't know if it works properly on
other architectures, but at least it would give people the opportunity 
to test it on embedded PPC/Arm/MIPS/CRIS/whatever.
From a quick grep over a recent BK tree, the only files who have 
sections conditional on CONFIG_SWAP are:
include/linux/page-flags.h
include/linux/swap.h
mm/vmscan.c
mm/Makefile
no architecture specific code at all. From a quick look, the
conditionals are rather simple (most of them are replacements of
actual functions by dummies) and should work on all architectures.
Please let people test it on non-X86, after all it's still a 
development kernel. Any breakage is unlikely to be serious and 
embedded people are going to be the most interested since it 
saves some space.
