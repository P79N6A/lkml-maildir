Hi,
If you validate the www.kernel.org web page with W3C validator (http://
validator.w3.org/), you can see that it's not valid. Do it!.
I think that it's important that the web page of the kernel were W3C valid 
because the this web page is the one of emblematic web pages of the Community 
and so it should follow the W3C standards. So it should be W3C.
I don't know who concerns this....
Another thing: is the webpage of kernel accessibility?. I think that it's 
(very) important that _everybody_ could access to our web page, without any 
requirement of physical features of her/his body. I think that it's crucial 
to have an _universal_ web page.
Thanks,
Xan.
