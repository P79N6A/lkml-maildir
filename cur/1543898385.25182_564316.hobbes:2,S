At last I got it due to all of everybody's very nice explanations :). 
Here's the provisional page tables intialization scenario:
We want to store pg0 pte addresses to high 20bits swapper_pg_dir entries,
we also want the PRESENT,RW,USER flags be set in those entries. This is 
done by  getting the address of each pg0 entry and adding 7 to it (Brian's
note). Since pg0 entires address are page aligned(Andreas, Jeremy notes),
adding 7 will assure that the first 3 bits are set without affecting the
high 20 bits.
Big Thanks!,
