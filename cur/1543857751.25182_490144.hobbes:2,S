Andrew,
My stance on handshaking has always been that it should be something
controlled via termios, not via some driver specific ioctl() which is
different for every single driver.
I see that this 2.4 patch actually does that, which is great.  A
couple of points though:
1. CRTSCTS should select RTS/CTS flow control.  There should be CDTRDSR
   for DTR/DSR flow, not CHWFLOW plus some additional ioctl.
2. the patch does not adequately handle switching flow control modes.
   The handling in set_termios is not sufficient - eg, when switching
   from CRTSCTS with de-asserted CTS to CDTRDSR with asserted DSR will
   result in the driver believing that the flow control signal is still
   deasserted.  Incidentally, this also directly affects changing the
   flow control method via the additional ioctls.
