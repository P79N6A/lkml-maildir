I do not think so. I have printk (KERN_NOTICE ...) scattered  
throughout to make sure the ioctl() is succeeding and to print out  
registers on the hardware. Those are showing up in /var/log/messages  
without a hitch. If there is a setting for printk in interrupts, then  
maybe because I would not know the macro to look for in the  
configuration.
