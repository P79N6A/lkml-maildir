Still wrong.  SCSI also needs HAS_DMA and SCSI_DMA.  HAS_DMA furthermore
depends on !NO_DMA.  So that would mean
menuconfig USB_STORAGE
	tristate "USB Mass Storage support"
	depends on USB && BLOCK && HAS_DMA
	select SCSI
	select SCSI_DMA
But copying all (currently existing) dependencies of SCSI to USB_STORAGE
is arguably a bad solution.  There are four other potential solutions:
  - Let kconfig look up the dependencies of SCSI.  If they are
    fulfilled, present the option USB_STORAGE and switch on SCSI if
    the user chooses USB_STORAGE.
  - Let kconfig recursively look up all dependencies of SCSI and their
    subsequent dependencies.  Try to switch them all on if the user
    chooses USB_STORAGE.  If that fails for whatever reason, say to
    the user:  I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.
  - Don't use 'select' on options which have further dependencies.
  - Design and implement UIs which don't need 'select' in the first
    place.
