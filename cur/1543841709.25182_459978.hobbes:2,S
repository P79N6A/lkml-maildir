Subject: prevent swsusp with PAE

Next version of prevent-swsusp-with-PAE, this time I disable it in
Kconfig.
PAE + swsusp results in hard-to-debug crash about 50% of time during
resume. Cause is known, fix needs to be ported from x86-64 (but we
can't make it to 2.6.18, and I'd like this to be worked around in
2.6.18).
