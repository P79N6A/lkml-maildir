Did you compile ELF support as a module?
You _have_ to set CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF=y for kmod to work. Otherwise,
the first time you trigger kmod it will try to call modprobe,
which will trigger a load of the ELF binfmt module,
which will try to call modprobe,
which will trigger a load of the ELF binfmt module,
...
ad infinitum until we die with ENOMEM.

There was a change to kmod in 2.3.27, but I fail to see how it
could cause the problems you described. If you try 2.3.26,
does it still not work?
