Well not exactly. Many models of Cyrix cpu's (6x86L and 6x86 pr200+)
ran at bus speeds of 75mhz, which is why cyrix claimed its chip running at
150 clock, outperformed a P1 200. I haven't seen a K5 or an original K6
that was intended to run at anything greater than 66mhz bus speed. On
motherboards intended for P1 cpu's, many manufacturers allowed for 75mhz
bus speed, but warned the configuration may be unstable. Cyrix 6x86 have
voltage settings of 3.5v and 3.3v. K6's can have voltage settings of 2.9v
or 3.3v. 
The problem may very well have nothing to do with the cpu, or have
something to do with kernel code dealing with cyrix cpu's. However testing the
configuration with an intel P1 cpu will only help to isolate and track
down the problem. I have to say that my cyrix cpu didn't seem to become
really unstable until the 2.2 kernels arrived, but replacing the cpu with
a pentium appeared to fix the problem..and at the time I wasn't concerned
in isolating the source of the problems I was having, just stopping them.
