Yup.  We're ok with the current stuff, thanks.
(I haven't updated the mdev code yet because I need to build a 2.6.16-pre 
kernel with the new layout to test against, but I've got a couple options 
worked out.)

  The hotplug helper /sbin/hotplug is now officially deprecated. The control
  file /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug has moved to /sys/kernel/uevent_helper, but it
  is expected to be disabled on most systems in favor of udev and the netlink
  interface.

Cool.  For busybox, /sbin/hotplug is "the easy way".
