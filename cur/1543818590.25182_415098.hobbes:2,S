After having read-only mucked with the headers of a bunch of files[1]
I've selected a subset of 2500 or so with sizes going from 2K to 85M
which I want to copy to another directory in the same local
filesystem.  What is the "best" (CPU usage, fragmentation, wall clock
time, system responsiveness during and after the copy) way to copy
these files?  read+write, mmap+write, read+mmap, mmap+mmap+memcpy,
something else?  That's with recent kernels, of course.
  OG.
