It is always useful 8)
At least, looking at isdn, I see that it sometimes forgets to mark
NET_BH clearing tbusy. And even the fact that in the cases when
it does not forget it, clearing tbusy and marking bh are made
in different parts of code tells that the driver assumes wrong things.
I have to recoginse, it is exactly the reason why all the reports
on bugs related to isdn were directed immediately to wastebusket.
Certainly, I apologize, but if the bug were not confirmed for ethernet
and slip, this politics would be continued.
