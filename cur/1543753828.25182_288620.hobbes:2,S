No, it's "repeat until %ecx is zero or ZF is cleared", but the latter never happens
with movsl.  It's intended for cmpsl, scasl and friends (the assembler should
complain about using it here).

Yes, it should.

I have a suggestion.
hugang, you are currently replacing an array of pbes with a list of arrays
of pbes contained within individual pages.
I would go further and replace it with a single one-directional list
of pbes.  Namely, I would modify "struct pbe" in the following way:
struct pbe {
	unsigned long address;
	unsigned long orig_address;
	swp_entry_t swap_address;	
	struct pbe *next;
};
(AFAICT, the "dummy" field is only used by hugang - as a pointer)
and I would define "for_each_pbe()" as:
#define for_each_pbe(pbe, pblist) \
	for (pbe = pblist;  pbe;  pbe = pbe->next)
Then, the only non-trivial changes would be in alloc_pagedir() and
in swsusp_pagedir_relocate(), where I would need to link pbes to
each other.
This also would make the assembly parts independent of the
sizeof(struct pbe), which is currently hardcoded there.
What do you think?
Greets,
