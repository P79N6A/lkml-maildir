i think we could use your patch for development purposes as well, lets
merge the two efforts?
i'd suggest to name the /proc/sys/sched/ values the same way the constants
are called. Eg. /proc/sys/sched/CHILD_FORK_PENALTY. This makes it easier
to communicate suggested parameter changes.
i have a script that dumps the current sched-parameters state:
 [root@mars root]# ./getsched
 echo 95 > /proc/sys/kernel/CHILD_FORK_PENALTY
 echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/EXIT_WEIGHT
 echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/INTERACTIVE_DELTA
 echo 200 > /proc/sys/kernel/MAX_SLEEP_AVG
 echo 30 > /proc/sys/kernel/MAX_TIMESLICE
 echo 100 > /proc/sys/kernel/PARENT_FORK_PENALTY
 echo 70 > /proc/sys/kernel/PRIO_BONUS_RATIO
 echo 60 > /proc/sys/kernel/PRIO_CPU_HOG_RATIO
 echo 20 > /proc/sys/kernel/PRIO_INTERACTIVE_RATIO
 echo 200 > /proc/sys/kernel/STARVATION_LIMIT
the script is very simple:
 cd /proc/sys/kernel
 for N in *[A-Z]*; do echo "echo "`cat $N`" > /proc/sys/kernel/$N"; done
otherwise our approach is identical. This patch would always stay
separate, but could be readily applied by people who want more control
over the scheduler for development or whatever other reasons.
