Thanks very much, Rik. I need this eagerly.
I want to find a kernel project that can both be my graduation thesis
and contribute to the Linux kernel community. I read that page and
think your project--Swapout Clustering is interesting for me.
Is it alright for me to work on it? And can you give some help?
Thanks!
