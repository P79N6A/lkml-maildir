Subject: why is it called "asm-generic/atomic.h"?

  i'm just curious -- why does that particular header file have that
name?  its opening comment reads:
 * Allows to provide arch independent atomic definitions without the need to
 * edit all arch specific atomic.h files.
but that's *not* what that header file does.  rather, it simply
defines the "long" form of the atomic operations that can be used *in
addition to* the arch-specific ones.
  wouldn't it make more sense to have called that header file
something like "asm-generic/atomic_long.h", so as not to mislead folks
into thinking it represented an *alternative* to those other header
files?
