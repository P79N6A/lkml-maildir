Tested 2.6.1[-mm#] and 2.6.5[-aa#]:
inexplicables crashes, mouse, NFS etc.,
on 2-3 of our 8 Linux machines (0.1-6 years old),
not usable for production, need five 9 (99.999).
I don't have logs, always switched back to 2.4.25.
Starting with AT&T UNIX SVR2 (1986, rock solid),
later Linux 2.0, then 2.2, then 2.4,
2.4.17 was the 1st veritable stable 2.4 kernel.
2.4.25 had an uptime >=33 days before changing
all machines to 2.4.26.  Stable since 1-3 days.
Feedback only and
kind regards
Mario Vanoni, _not_ in lkml!
PS The standalone 9th M$ machine at job,
    boot each morning,
    some days needs 1-3 reboots on the same day.
    From the view point five 9 a piece of jewellery.
