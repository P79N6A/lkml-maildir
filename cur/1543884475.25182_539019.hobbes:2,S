Whatever names the FireWire modules will get, we shouldn't change the
names anymore _after_ the new code appears in mainline.
Anyway, if the same names really should be used, as Olaf demands, then
it affects at most ohci1394, sbp2, eth1394, ieee1394.  However, ieee1394
is probably never loaded explicitly by scripts (only auto-loaded per
dependency of the others), and the other three all have proper module
aliases.
If the new modules are meant to look like the old ones, then there is
also the problem with module parameters.  Many of the old stack's module
parameters are merely there as hacks or workarounds though;  therefore
they shouldn't appear in shipped scripts and shipped configurations anyway.
