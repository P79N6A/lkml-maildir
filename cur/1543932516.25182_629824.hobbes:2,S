Now I have some numbers on 100,000 sequential mmap reads:
                                    user       system    cpu        total
(1-1)  plain -mm, 128KB readaround: 3.224      2.554     48.40%     11.838
(1-2)  plain -mm, 256KB readaround: 3.170      2.392     46.20%     11.976
(2)  patched -mm, 128KB readahead:  3.117      2.448     47.33%     11.607
The patched (2) has smallest total time. It has no cache hit overheads
and less I/O block time(thanks to async readahead). Here the I/O size
makes no much difference, since there's only one single stream.
Note that (1-1)'s real I/O size is 64KB and (1-2)'s real I/O size is
128KB, since the half of the read-around pages will be cache hits.
