Hi people,
I gave a shot at linux 2.6.6-bk9 on PPC32 (ibook G4) today, noticed two
problems. First, pbbuttonsd complains about /dev/adb missing and indeed,
it isn't there. Looks like related to Ben's changes to
drivers/macintosh/adb.c, but maybe due to some devfs (I know, outdated
;-)) configuration problem?
Second problem, tried to mount an usb key, and it failed: mount hung.
(ehci driver).
I didn't have time to investigate this stuff, but thought it could help
to mention it ?
Thanks,
