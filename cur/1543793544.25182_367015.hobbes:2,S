BTW, the issue is that in packet split mode, the e1000 driver is
feeding paged based non-linear SKBs into the stack on receive which is
completely legal but aparently netpoll or something parsing netpoll RX
packets does not handle it properly.
That's why the reporter suggested that perhaps an skb_linearize()
call could be added to fix the problem, but it is unknown whether
that call can be made in the context in which it would be needed.
