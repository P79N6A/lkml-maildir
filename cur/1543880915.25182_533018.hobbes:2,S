ugh, that was bad of us.

But there might be 32-bit applications out there which are using the
present wrong structure?
otoh, I assume that those applications would be using taskstats.h and would
hence encounter this bug and we would have heard about it, is that correct?
otoh^2, 32-bit applications running under 32-bit kernels will presently be
functioning correctly, and your change will require that those applications
be recompiled, I think?
This patch looks like 2.6.20 and 2.6.21 material, but very carefully...
