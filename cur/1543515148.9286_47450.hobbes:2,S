I hate to be so verbose, but I just thought I'd throw one more factoid out
there, in case it makes anyone say, 'Ahhh yes':  
All of the illegal blocks are actually ASCII data from the files I was
accessing at the time:
raid0_map bug: hash->zone0==NULL for block 808464440
raid0_map bug: hash->zone0==NULL for block 171521844
raid0_map bug: hash->zone0==NULL for block 959524912
808464440 -> 0x30303038 = "0008"
171521844 -> 0x0A393734 = "\n974"
959524912 -> 0x39313030 = "9100"
The large files were all 'call records' containing only ASCII digit
characters and linefeeds.  Subsequent accesses to the files caused no
problems.
