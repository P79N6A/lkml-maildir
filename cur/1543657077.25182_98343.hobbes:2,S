Presumably the run-child-first change.  process_load is complex.  I
haven't looked into its dynamics and I'm not sure what, if anything,

Well for the sorts of things which you are interested in, SMP is not the
target market, shall we say?
Is the variability seen in other kernels (especially 2.4)?  If not then
we'd need to find out what causes it.
