There were no reasons given in the mail I replied to. Perhaps I missed
another mail from you earlier.
I'm also puzzled by the one comemnt you made. You seem to imply that
seeing
foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo))
means it doesn't need checking. That is false on various grounds
1.	A lot of stuff is using void *, char * etc
2.	You've no idea that foo is the full object not a generic object with
stuff tacked on.
So thats very much false. You have to know what is really being
allocated in both cases. In the sizeof(*foo) case you also have to go
back, work out wtf foo really is and check that its not an array pointer
because sizeof char[40] is not the same as sizeof(* char *).
Thankfully Linus hates typedefs so that removes many of those
