It is not so obvious to me what should be done. Note that this problem is not
connected to recent changes, there were (I hope) completely transparent for
the delayed works.
The comment for cancel_delayed_work() work says
	Note that the work callback function may still be running on return from
	cancel_delayed_work(). Run flush_scheduled_work() or flush_work() to wait
	on it.
The same is true for cancel_rearming_delayed_work(), but not documented. Note
also that the comment above is wrong, we can't use flush_work(dwork->work), it
was never supposed to do because queue_delayed_work() use work->data "wrongly".
Now,
	- We can change cancel_rearming_delayed_work() so it does a final
	  flush_workqueue(). But this means that 2 flavors of cancel delayed
	  work will have a subtle difference.
		OR
	- Document the fact that cancel_rearming_delayed_work() doesn't
	  garantee that ->func() is not running upon return, fix affected
	  callers.
Finally, we can also tweak delaed_works so it will actually be possible
to use flush_work(dwork->work) after cancel_{,rearming_}delayed_work().
Seems to make sense, but needs (hopefully not too horrid) changes.
And other problems. Currently cancel_rearming_delayed_work(dwork) will hang
if dwork was never scheduled, or cancel_rearming_delayed_work() was already
called before. The first problem is solved by this patch, the second is still
here. The fix is simple _unless_ we are going to implement "flush_work() works
on dwork->work" above.
Oh, I can't make a decision, please tell me...
Oleg.
