Subject: [patch 22/60] KVM: Fix hang on uniprocessor
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

2.6.23-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Marko Kohtala <marko.kohtala@gmail.com>
This is not in mainline, as it was fixed differently in that tree.
first_cpu(cpus) returns the only CPU when NR_CPUS is 1 regardless of
the cpus mask. Therefore we avoid a kernel hang in
KVM_SET_MEMORY_REGION ioctl on uniprocessor by not entering the loop at
all.
