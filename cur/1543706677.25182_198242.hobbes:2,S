Hi Richard:
    I am not sure looking at the ksyms will give me an actual measure.
Lets take an example,
I have a driver "foo.o" that i insmod, lets say. If this driver uses kmalloc
or malloc to dynamically
utilize RAM space for its internal operation, I don't think your suggested
method will capture
that dynamic allocation of memory, am i correct?
  I want to get a real-time ram usage of a specified dynamically loaded
module.
thanks,
Gopi

You might make some sense of /proc/ksyms...
This is for a module called ramdisk.
