Hi there, all masters of kernel code,
I just discovered that the kernel code for 2.4.33.3 contains three
if-statements that never can change their values, whence they should
be repaired or eliminated. In source directory linux/drivers/char the
files vt.c and keyboard.c produce these warning upon compilation:
    vt.c:166: varning: comparison is always false due to limited range  
              of data type
    vt.c:289: varning: comparison is always false due to limited range
              of data type
    keyboard.c:640: varning: comparison is always true due to limited
                    range of data type
I did the compilation with gcc 3.3.5 on Debian Sarge. This behaviour
appeared first for kernel 2.2.19, since I wanted to revive the old
minirtl edition, but to my surprise the same warnings appear also
with the brand new kernel 2.4.33.3.
Best regards
