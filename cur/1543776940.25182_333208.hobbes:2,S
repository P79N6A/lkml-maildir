While adding support for partitions on sr is trivial it has a huge
drawback: it's chaning the dev_t space by using up device numbers
for partitions, so /dev/sr0 ff will have different device numbers
with that change applied.  I have an old patch that's supposed to
enable support for partitioned scsi removable devices at
http://rechner.lst.de/~hch/hacks/sr-parts.diff,
 I'm not sure it
actually ever worked (but you should get the basic idea from it)
