Yes, the reaction was legitimate but it could have been better.  It would 
have benefited everyone if instead of posting rants, numbers and patches or 
suggested solutions were posted.  Up until today, some posters that 
complain on how CFS fairs worse than SD simply post reports that say:
"I use this system in this way and it does not fair well with cfs!"
Look at this one for example:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/31/199
It looks technical but it isn't.
The author simply stated that he built his own lightweight Linux box that 
specializes in audio but there has not been any technical characteristic of 
the problem.  We don't even know the audio libraries he's using but simply 
claimed that he wrote his own.
The report, if I were the one to debug it, is completely useless since it 
does not even give some reproducability hints nor technical characteristics 
of the system.
This is what some of the SD fan-boys do.  Rant.
Thank you very much.
Best Regards,
Carlo
