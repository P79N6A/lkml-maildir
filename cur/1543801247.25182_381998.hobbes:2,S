gcc 4.1 calls them .text.unlikely and you need to use
-freorder-blocks-and-partition
switch.  But I haven't been able to reproduce it on a short testcase I
cooked up, so maybe it is broken ATM (it put the whole function into
.text rather than the expected part into .text.unlikely and left
empty .text.unlikely).
