in 2.4 you can disable swap just fine (with oom killer disabled). until
I/somebody fix 2.6 you can workaround this problem while still avoiding
to swap much by setting /proc/sys/vm/swappiness to 0 or similar to tell
the VM "please don't swap" even if swap is enabled ;). That will still
prevent the oom killer to kick in. The oom killer is forbidden to run
as long as `free` tells you that >= 4k of swap are still available to the
OS. There are no other fundamental vm problems left I'm aware of in
latest 2.6 besides these no-swap and oom issues.
