   I think asking if devfs is safe round here is probably a bad
idea. You might get an answer. At length. :)
   However, it works for me (2.4.21-pre5-ac3), and has worked for many
previous versions of 2.4.

   I've not met one which doesn't, but then I don't have lots of
hardware to test on.

   The udev stuff in 2.6 looks like it might become very nice indeed,
but you don't have to wait for that to use devfs.
