That's pretty much the idea behind MSI... it looks like any other PCI 
bus transaction, rather than needing a separate pin.

That reminds me of a potential driver bug -- MSI-aware drivers need to 
call pci_intx(pdev,0) to turn off the legacy PCI interrupt, before 
enabling MSI interrupts.
So far, MSI history on x86 has always followed these rules:
* it works on Intel
* it doesn't work [well | at all] on AMD/NV
The only thing that has changed recently is that people are trying to 
get it working on AMD/NV as well.  (Brice Goglin's stuff starting at 
6397c75cbc4d7dbc3d07278b57c82a47dafb21b5 in 'git log')
Seems to me this hda-intel driver patch is fallout from 
pci_msi_enabled() not failing on enough systems (all AMD/NV?).
Anyway, if you want your master switch, put it there, not in each driver...
