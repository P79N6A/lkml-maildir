I have 14 machines all running Linux 2.2.19 with reiserfs.  All
have been running for at least 4 months 24/7.
All are AMD Athlons or Durons, with 1.5GB memory, and are
interconnected by a 16 port 100mbit/s switch.  All machines have
tons of cooling and are in a temperature, humidity and power
controlled environment.  No overclocking.
The particular machine valen is a 1.333 GHz Athlon Thunderbird
Earlier today it started reporting:
Feb  3 08:24:57 valen kernel: kmem_alloc: Bad slab magic (corrupt)              (name=size-4096)
Feb  3 08:25:17 valen last message repeated 7 times                            ...
Feb  3 08:27:46 valen kernel: kmem_alloc: Bad slab magic (corrupt)              (name=size-4096)
Feb  3 08:27:47 valen kernel: nfs: task 2109 can't get a request slot
Feb  3 08:29:16 valen kernel: nfs: task 2111 can't get a request slot
Feb  3 08:29:24 valen kernel: nfs: task 2112 can't get a request slot
Feb  3 08:29:47 valen kernel: nfs: task 2109 can't get a request slot
...
rebooted machine, then later...
Feb  3 16:50:27 valen kernel: call_verify: server accept status: 2
Feb  3 16:50:27 valen kernel: RPC: garbage, retrying    0
Feb  3 16:50:27 valen kernel: call_verify: server accept status: 2
Feb  3 16:50:27 valen kernel: RPC: garbage, retrying    0
Feb  3 16:50:27 valen kernel: call_verify: server accept status: 2
Feb  3 16:50:27 valen kernel: RPC: garbage, exit EIO
Feb  3 16:50:27 valen kernel: nfs_get_root: getattr error = 5
Though I think most of the machines occasionally get these later
messages.
