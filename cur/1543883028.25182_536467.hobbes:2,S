--- BTW, I don't think that writing to unallocated parts of disk is good 
idea. These filesystems have cool write benchmarks, but one subtle (and 
unbenchmarkable) problem:
They group files according to time when they were created and not 
according to directory hierarchy.
When the user has directory with project files and he edited different 
files at different times, normal filesystems will place the files near 
each other (so that "grep blabla *" is fast) and log-structured 
filesystems will scatter the files over the whole disk.
