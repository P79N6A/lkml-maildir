Do the patches need to be applied all together?  If I apply just the first
two, do I get something that's broken?

I mean, have dvb_net_close() call dvb_generic_release() and then do the
extra stuff.

What about this?  I don't have any hot pluggable hardware, so how does
dvb_net_release() get called when the device disconnects?

fopts_put() lowers the usecount of the module that owns the inode.  I don't
see how it works to add this when it wasn't here before?  Isn't it going to
mess up the module usecount by doing a fopts_put() that's not matched by a
fopts_get()?  I didn't see anything in your patch that added a fops_put().
