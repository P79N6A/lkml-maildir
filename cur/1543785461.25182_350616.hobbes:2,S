another advantage of having an auto-config for the kernel is that people 
who are experimenting may have the auto-config find hardware that they 
didn't realize they had (or they didn't realize that support had been 
added)
I know that most of my kernels don't have support for everything the 
motherboards have on them (mostly I don't care much about the other 
features, but in some cases they weren't supported, or weren't worth the 
hassle of figureing the correct config for when I started, and I've never 
gone back to try and figure it out)
and while I'm not a kernel hacker, I've been compiling my own kernels 
since about '94 so I'm not exactly a newbe :-)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
