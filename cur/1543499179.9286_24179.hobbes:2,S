i suspect your problem might be a BIOS bug not setting the MTRR's
correctly for the base memory - i've seen that happen once. Take a look at
your /proc/mtrr output: 
[root@moon mingo]# cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
if you see the above output then the settings are wrong, just do this to
fix it up for 1G physical RAM:
  echo "base=0x00000000 size=0x40000000 type=write-back" > /proc/mtrr
i hope this helps,
