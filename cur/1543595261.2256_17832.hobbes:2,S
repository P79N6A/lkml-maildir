I think that's accurate.

That's not accurate.  The Linux way is an infinitely nicer architecture.
For each thing that is shareable you have code like
	vm_fork(... flags)
	{
		if (flags & VM_SHARE) return;
		do the work to fork the data structure
	}
In other words, it's designed to be shared.  The IRIX stuff is disgusting,
you really don't want anything to do with sproc().    It _sounds_ like they
are the same but they aren't - for example, with sproc you get your very
own TLB miss handler.  Doesn't that sound special?
