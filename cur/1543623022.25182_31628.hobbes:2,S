Should this still be reporting becker@scyld.com if you guys are now
maintaining it?  This is doubly true of the URL, since that URL will
not have the driver that is in the kernel.
PS - any chance you can fix this for xirc2ps_cs?  I can test if you want,
     as my current card always fails to word after APM suspend (needs a
     "cardctl eject; cardctl insert" to work again.
Cheers, Andreas
