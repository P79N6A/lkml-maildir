OK, thanks.

And indeed I do build tg3 in-kernel. But since the config
 option was present previously, perhaps it would have
 been the case to change the help text for tg3 explaining
 that now a non-modular build requires an extra step ?
Or maybe kbuild allows to select FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL
 if tg3 is built non-modular ?
My only observation is that a make oldconfig shouldn't
 change a working setup to a non-working one (though
 it already happened once to me in a couple of weeks,
 the other being I915 DRM being silently skipped as a
 consequence of becoming dependent on CONFIG_FB)
 with a new kernel patch.
Clearly, if there is no easy way to avoid such a situation,
 it's okay - LKML and the other Linux-related lists are
 always helpful.
Thanks again, ciao,
