I think you can "remove" (well, not literally)
some of the not-so-random data in the inputs
for the random generator (like the 60Hz of the
current, processor harmonics, etc.) by first
sending the random-data trough a compressor.
bzip2 or gzip or whatsoever. By compressing
data, you'll remove redundancy from data which
should remove repeating events like the 60hz
stuff. See also the thread that spawned on this
mailinglist on that message I wrote about the
randomness of the kernel :-)
