I am trying to keep add_memory non-sparsemem specific.  With reserve
memory the memory is already present and so using
register_memory_resource as a key to find out if it is already present
won't work.
I can build ontop of this if you want me to.  I would like to test this
to make sure it works for me. (I will do this sometime today)
Thanks,
