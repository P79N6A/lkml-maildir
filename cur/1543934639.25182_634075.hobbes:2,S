I am hoping that Nick's ticket spinlocks will fix this problem.
Would you happen to have any test cases for the above problem that
I could use to reproduce the problem and look for an automatic fix?
Any fix that requires the sysadmin to tune things _just_ right seems
too dangerous to me - especially if a change in the workload can
result in the system doing exactly the wrong thing...
The idea is valid, but it just has to work automagically.
Btw, if page_referenced() is called less, the locks that try_to_unmap()
also takes should get less contention.
