I've finally gotten around to applying you patches, but I've only
put them in the 2.3.x development series kernel because I don't
want to put this into the stable kernel just yet.
I had to fix several formatting and true bugs while integrating your
changes, for example:
+static inline int solaris_m(unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd, u32 arg)
+{
+
+	struct file * flip;
+	flip=fget(fd);
This causes a file descriptor leak, you never fput(flip), and in fact
you never even use the flip variable anywhere in this function so I
just removed these two lines.  Next:
+	printk("solaris_setsockopt: optname (%#x) optval (%#x)\n", optname, val);
Please don't leave such debugging print statements enable in patches
you'd like me to apply to the real tree, I removed this.
Otherwise your patch was mostly fine, thanks for the work.
Later,
David S. Miller
