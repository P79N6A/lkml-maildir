It simply needs changes to every arch codes in architecture specific way, as
I explained in #2. This is practical, or not depending on how we view :)
Better not go on with this since there's lighter, better known solution.

See how each and every php drivers in 2.5 manage this differently only to
fake pci driver for non-existing pci_bus w/ own overhead. It's ugly.

The simplest, sound way of exporting bare pci config access function is what
I proposed as #1. It doesn't need any change on arch pci codes.
More specifically, pci_bus_read_config_##size(pci_bus, ...) is simply
replaced with
pci_read_config_##size(pci_dev, ...).

I proposed pure PCI config access method required by some kernel components,
not just to get around the absence of pci_bus in 2.4, but also to address
the ugliness of having everyone fake pci driver w/ individual's overhead.
The #1 proposed is the solution for all architectures w/o any change in
existing arch pci codes, while the concept has already been proved.
Below is copied from previous email thread.
