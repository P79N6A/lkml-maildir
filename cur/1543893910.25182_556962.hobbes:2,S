I think it might be made not too unreasonable by adding a TASK_FROZEN state.
But I am still persuaded by my "hide in the corner" plan.

The bug was about a case where recalc_sigpending_tsk would set
TIF_SIGPENDING when it hadn't been set before (wants_signal).  It has
nothing to do with the rm_from_queue_full being done there.  It's just a
violation of the necessary rule that when you set TIF_SIGPENDING on another
thread you better call signal_wake_up on it.

There is no need for the +, just the -.  The calling thread is the one
where know there is certainly no perturbation of behavior due to leaving
TIF_SIGPENDING set rather than clearing it.  It's just going to exit the
syscall and deal with signal state properly on the way out either way.
Doing recalc_sigpending is an unnecessary optimization of the corner case.

Before completely revamping the whole set of entrypoints to be saner all
around, yes.
Thanks,
