Hello,
lilo has its own COMMAND_LINE_SIZE constant.  It is not depended on
the kernel one.
lilo-22.7 lilo.h:
#define COMMAND_LINE_SIZE        256     /* CL_LENGTH */
lilo-22.7.2 lilo.h:
#define COMMAND_LINE_SIZE       512     /* CL_LENGTH */
So at worse case scenario it passes 256 bytes into the kernel
truncated with null terminated. Best case scenario it passes 512
bytes. Anyway... As long as you don't modify lilo, the kernel can
expect what-ever command-line length it wishes and truncate it to
match its own COMMAND_LINE_SIZE.
Please notice that we modify the kernel so it can accept long command
lines at boot protocol >= 2.02, but we don't modify  lilo behavior. So
lilo user will not be able to use the long command line size, until
lilo is modified to support it.
There is also a problem with grub, I've written a patch for it:
