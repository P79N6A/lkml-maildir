Here's another suspend/resume artifact: one of my boxes wouldnt resume, 
it hangs at:
[    1.456633] pci 0000:00:18.2: resuming
[    1.456641] pci 0000:00:18.3: resuming
[    1.456648] 8139too 0000:05:07.0: resuming
[    1.456667] radeonfb 0000:01:00.0: resuming
the box is pingable but otherwise no console and it's hung as well. [I 
got the log above via netconsole]
disabling the following radeonfb options in the .config made resume work 
again:
 CONFIG_FB_RADEON=y
 CONFIG_FB_RADEON_I2C=y
 CONFIG_FB_RADEON_BACKLIGHT=y
