Out of concern that this problem may be caused by the smpnice patches 
(which modify load balancing) I've done some testing on my HT 
workstation (with 2.6.16-rc4 installed).  The short summary of the 
results of my tests is that the smpnice patches do not appear to be at 
fault and that the problem lies in the kernel build mechanism for recent 
kernels.
More detail:
Test 1: build linux-2.6.14 with "make -j 2" and observe the results 
using top with the "latest CPU ran on" column enabled.  Result: both 
channels are being used and the build appears to be running in parallel.
Test 2: do the same test with a 2.6.16-rc5 kernel source.  Result: both 
channels are not being used and the build appears to be running serially.
Hence my conclusion that the problem is caused by recent (since 2.6.14) 
changes to the build mechanism and that it is not a scheduler or load 
balancing problem.
The good news from this is that a binary search trying to find when the 
problem doesn't need to reboot with the kernels each time but just 
evaluate the build process.
