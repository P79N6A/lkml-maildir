Which device is hdc?  You should not have a slave without a master after
all, since that technically violates ATA specs as far as I know.
Do you have DMA enabled?  Are you even using a native driver for the
PATA interface (many distributions have a nasty habit of loading the
ide-generic driver when using SATA drives for the HDs and only optical
drives are on PATA).
The dmesg output at boot would give an idea as to which driver is used
for PATA drives.
DVD burning without DMA just doesn't work in general.  Also some DVD
drives require an 80wire cable to work reliably.  It does appear from
hdparm though that DMA is enabled, although I am never sure if I can
trust that part of hdparm so I ask /proc/ide/hdX/settings instead.
