Two answers to this I just found out..
This is a system I installed BusyBox 1.8.0 on, and running 'fbset
1280x1024-75' does nothing. I copied over the real fbset binary from
my Debian install and when I ran it the same way, it worked perfectly.
So, yes, it appears that it is possible to change it after the fact,
but for some reason BusyBox can't do it. The only problem then appears
to be setting the fb mode from the boot line.
BusyBox 1.8.0 binary:
# fbset 1280x1024-75
mode "1280x1024-75"
        # D: 134.880 MHz, H: 79.905 kHz, V: 74.958 Hz
        geometry 1280 1024 1280 3264 8
        timings 7414 232 64 38 1 112 3
        accel true
        rgba 8/0,8/0,8/0,0/0
endmode
(nothing happens)
Debian binary:
# /tmp/fbset -v 1280x1024-60
