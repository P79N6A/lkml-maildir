Agreed, but this is not about sensible kernel configuration.
The synclink drivers have been building and working with generic
HDLC for some time with no problem.
What we are cleaning up here is errors from building
randomly (and not necessarily usable) generated configs.
The only thing I'm unsure of at this point is the
changes to net/wan/Makefile. I'm setting up some
test builds to check this out.
