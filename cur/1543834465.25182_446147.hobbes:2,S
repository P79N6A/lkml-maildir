Well, I changed the TSC vs ACPI PM timer priority ordering to be more
like x86-64 (Andi had a similar patch he was proposing as well). For
awhile suse/redhat kernels have been swapping them, as the TSC gives
such a performance boost, however the ACPI PM timer is usually the safer
option (distro customers are often told to use clock=pmtmr on some
boxes).
I'll see what we can do to narrow it down, but its been assumed by both
x86-64 and the new i386 code that the TSCs on Intel SMP boxes are
synched, unless we're explicitly told they aren't (Summit, etc).
With the current code it is trivial to mark the TSC as unstable and the
system will automatically fall back to the next best clocksource. The
difficulty is just making sure we've got all the cases covered without
needlessly disqualifying synced systems.
Andi: If this is a generic issue, and not specific to Matthias' box, we
may need to re-think the assumption that Intel SMP is synced. You're
thoughts?

Matthias: "clock=pmtmr" is probably the best workaround in the short
term. Could you send me your dmesg and dmidecode output? We'll try to
find something to key off of so it will mark the tsc as unstable by
default on your system.
