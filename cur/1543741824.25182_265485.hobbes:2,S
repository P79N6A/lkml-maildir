To answer that you should have quoted a bit more: "the annoying part are 
the business practices of its owner".

Unfortunately it's not that easy, because you're still missing the point.
I don't care what software you use, I don't care what license Larry uses 
for its products. I absolutely don't care.
The problem is that you support a license which limits everyones ability 
on how to access the kernel source and gives Larry full control over it. 
Give me a good reason, why he can deny me that rather simple request to 
get some data out of the repository. On the one hand you blame Andrea for 
not developing an alternative, on the other hand we don't have access to 
the data to actually help other projects. The kernel source is the data 
that we care most about, why can Larry limit the ways we can make use of 
it?
Linus, what happened to the early promises, that the data wouldn't be 
locked into bk? Is the massively reduced data set in the cvs repository 
really all we ever get out of it again?
bye, Roman
