you're right:
int install_page(struct mm_struct *mm, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
		unsigned long addr, struct page *page, pgprot_t prot)
[..]
	flush_icache_page(vma, page);
	set_pte(pte, mk_pte(page, prot));
	pte_chain = page_add_rmap(page, pte, pte_chain);
	pte_unmap(pte);
[..]
(this make me understand better some of the arguments in the previous
emails too ;)
So ether we declare 32bit archs obsolete in production with 2.6, or we
drop rmap behind remap_file_pages.
actually other more invasive ways could be to move rmap into highmem.
Also the page clustering could also hide part of the mem overhead by
assuming the pagetables to be contiguos, but page clustering isn't part
of mainline yet either.
Something has to change since IMHO in the current 2.5.73 remap_file_pages
is nearly useless.
