Yeah, sorry.  I've uploaded the below to the hot-fixes directory - it
should repair things.
Jeff, given its track record, I have to say that my confidence in this work
is nanoscopic.  Given that, and given the importance of reiserfs and given
the low rate of reiser3 development and given my ignorance of how reiserfs
works, I'm inclined to move very slowly on these patches.
It would really help if Chris or one of the namesys developers could take
the time to review and test these patches closely, please.
