A -final should never be changed from the last -rc. That defeats the
purpose of having -rc releases (rc == 'release candidate' ;)). If you
do make changes to the last -rc, then you need to release another -rc
with those changes. If all's good, then you can release that /last/
- -rc with /no/ changes as the One and True Release.
