AFAIK, Andrew Morton was considering concurrent calls to die() when he
added die_lock.  There had been bug reports where both cpus were trying
to dump registers at the same time so the output was interleaved and
unreadable, die_lock prevented that.
IMHO it is unrealistic to expect that all code inside die() will never
fail.  Any unexpected kernel corruption could cause the register or
backtrace dump to fail.  The patch gets the best of both worlds.  It
protects against recursive errors and against concurrent calls to
die().
