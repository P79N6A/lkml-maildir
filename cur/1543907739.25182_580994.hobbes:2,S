Okay, instrumented it and all of that now.
Yes, sd + libata-scsi send the proper FLUSH_CACHE_EXT and STANDBY1 commands
immediately prior to the suspend-to-RAM, and there are no other commands
sneaking through at the same time.  Good.
But the retract count still increments if I've recently written a signficant
amount of data.
My suspend script now has this little chunk of code at the point
where it actually does the suspend-to-RAM:
    sync; sync
    hdparm -F /dev/sda   ## flush drive write cache
    sleep 1              ## allow time for the flush to complete
    echo mem > /sys/power/state  ## suspend-to-RAM
 
Without the "sleep 1", it doesn't always eliminate the extra Retract,
so I hypothesize that the FLUSH_CACHE_EXT command is implemented in
an asynchronous fashion by the drive:  it returns immediately before
it has actually completed writing cached data to disk.  The "sleep 1"
seems to give it enough time to finish up, at least for me.
