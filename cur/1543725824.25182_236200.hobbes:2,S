This bug is probably unique to yourself and a couple of other people.  If
it was hitting everyone, all the machines in the world would be going oom
during the nightly updatedb run.
Can you try a different compiler version?  And try disabling any "unusual"
config options, such as filesystem quotas, extended attributes, etc?
Can you narrow the onset of the problem down to any particular kernel
snapshot?
Try disabling laptop_mode, if it's set.
Carefully review the logs for any oopses: oopsing while holding
shrinker_sem will do this for sure.
