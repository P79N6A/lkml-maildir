very nice approach! It might require smarter hardware to be really 
efficient, but the generic ability for Linux to utilize S3 automatically 
would _quickly_ drive the creation of smarter hardware i'm sure - so i'd 
propose to include this even if it wastes power in some cases.
a quick feature request: could you please make the wake-on-RTC 
capability generic and add a CONFIG_DEBUG_SUSPEND_ON_RAM=y config option 
(disabled by default) that does a short 1-second suspend-to-RAM sequence 
upon bootup? That way we could test s2ram automatically (which is a MUCH 
needed feature for automated regression testing and automatic 
bisection). In addition, some sort of 'suspend for N seconds' /sys or 
/dev/rtc capability would be nice as well.
btw., how far are you from having a working prototype?
