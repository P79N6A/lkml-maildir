Hi all...
I have many problems with kernels from 2.6.8.1-mm3 and above (-mm4,
2.6.9-rc1,-mm1).
When initscripts reach the load of stored iptables rules, the box hangs.
If I disable iptables, it hangs on loading the sound module (snd_intel8x0
in my case).
I think the only common thing is that both do some load and _removal_ of
modules to check things.
Previuos kernels work fine (apart from the need to boot with pci=routeirq).
Any idea on what changed in 2.6.8.1-mm3 ?
TIA
