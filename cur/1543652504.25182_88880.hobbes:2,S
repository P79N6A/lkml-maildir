I have applied it again, now on 2.4.20-rc1 and it seems to work ok here, I
had the two cards tested in different orders, no problems. The machine is a
Dual Pentium with SMP enabled in case that matters.
I think it would be good to have this patch on 2.4.20, but if it is too late
for that, then please consider it for 2.4.21.
Regards...
