Well, as much as I hate to suggest it again, you _could_ hack the nfs
client to honor sticky as cap-enabled, but only if you can exercise total
filesystem security.  I only like the sticky bit for compatibility
reasons, because currently it has no other interpretation.  I still
disdain setuid root, because both the setuid bit and the uid already serve
another purpose.  I reallize this information can be duplicated in the
headers, but I just don't like it.
cheers,
	David
