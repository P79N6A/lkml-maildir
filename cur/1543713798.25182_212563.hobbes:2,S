I seem to recall reading that the DM based programs also need to be 64 
bit, since their 32 bit stuff was also broken?
The question I have is whether or not this is a kernel bug that should 
be fixed? As I understand the DM case, fixing it so that 32bit works, 
then breaks the 64bit interfaces, requiring re-compiles of the DM 
programs.
Cheers,
