That's not completely true; for example, openlog() opens a file
descriptor for the library's own use, as does sethostent().  I agree
that it creates difficulties if the library implementor wants to use a
file descriptor in a set of functions that didn't previously use one,
but with a bit of assistance from the kernel, that can be solved
without breaking the ABI.

Buggy in what way?  In the use of the NR_OPEN constant?

For specialized programs like that we can offer alternative fd
allocation strategies if necessary (although I expect that with
100,000 fds other things will limit performance more than
allocation).
None of those things is an excuse for breaking the ABI, however.
As I said to Davide, I was really protesting about the attitude that
we can just break the ABI however and whenever we like and force
programs to adapt.
Paul.
