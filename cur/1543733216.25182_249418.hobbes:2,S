So how do multiple root buses work? Since they are all in the same
domain it seems like a single IO operation would go to all of the root
bridges simultaneously. Then each root bridge matches to the address
and decides to send the IO operation on if there is a match.
Would the diagram be equivalent to having a single root bridge with
six transparent PCI bridges attached? The purpose of the six host
bridges is to let six PCI transactions happen in parallel, right?
Other that probing the PCI config space of the host bridges, is there
any way in software to know that there are six bridges, or is this
completely transparent?
When implementing the VGA control I'm running into the problem that
there is no root node in sysfs for the top of a domain. I need a
domain node to attach an attribute disabling all VGA devices in the
domain. In the zx1 diagram I could have vga devices on any of the
PCI-X or AGP buses.
With the xz1 sysfs would look like this:
/sys/devices/pci0000:00
/sys/devices/pci0000:01
/sys/devices/pci0000:02
/sys/devices/pci0000:03
/sys/devices/pci0000:04
/sys/devices/pci0000:05
would it make more sense if it looked like this?
/sys/devices/pci0000/00
/sys/devices/pci0000/01
/sys/devices/pci0000/02
/sys/devices/pci0000/03
/sys/devices/pci0000/04
/sys/devices/pci0000/05
Now I have a node for the top of the domain. I can make a vga
attribute like this:
/sys/devices/pci0000/vga
set it to zero and my code will disable all VGA devices in the domain.
My home system would switch from 
/sys/devices/pci0000:00
to
/sys/devices/pci0000/00
pp32 from
/sys/devices/pci0000:00
/sys/devices/pci0001:01
/sys/devices/pci0002:06
to
/sys/devices/pci0000/00
/sys/devices/pci0001/01
/sys/devices/pci0002/06
