The connection is that windows people don't see those errors, linux folks do. 
I believe, but don't know how to use the tools to verify it, that the first 
byte of a packet is being thrown away about .1% of the time for the pl2303, 
but I'm not sure if the FTDI driver still suffers from a similar rash.  I 
have only one such FTDI adapter in the system atm, and its in series with 
manual heyu commands only, so it doesn't get regularly exercised.  I figure 
it will do the least damage there.  The pl2303's are all hanging on a peg 
waiting for emergency use only, they were just too much trouble when they 
miss-fire and the system issues -wall warnings several times per hour.
