Hello,
After digging a bit in the archives I couldn't find the solution to my problem,
so I'm asking you guys.
I found the "matroxfb and 2.6.0-test2" thread, so it's possible to compile the
kernel with the matrox framebuffer, but I can't find what I'm missing. Did I
forget to set a config option (all copied from the 2.4.21 config except the
nForce2 agp chipset)?
This is the error I'm getting while linking. 
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x89c80): In function `matroxfb_set_par':
: undefined reference to `default_grn'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x89c85): In function `matroxfb_set_par':
: undefined reference to `default_blu'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x89c93): In function `matroxfb_set_par':
: undefined reference to `color_table'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x89c9b): In function `matroxfb_set_par':
: undefined reference to `default_red'
I would suspect I'm missing libraries, but I don't know which set. I'm runnig
with a dabian sarge distro, the system has an Athlon XP CPU, with asus A7N8X-X
mainboard, matrox G550 graphics card.
Could someone point me in the right direction to get this working?
