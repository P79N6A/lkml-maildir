Lest we get more wires crossed, the "x" in /proc/self/maps indicates
that userspace _requested_ executable mapping with PROT_EXEC.
It is independent of whether the kernel and hardware can grant a
non-executable mapping.  On my Athlon:
08048000-0804c000 r-xp 00000000 03:02 95153      /bin/cat
0804c000-0804d000 rw-p 00003000 03:02 95153      /bin/cat
bfffe000-c0000000 rwxp fffff000 00:00 0
The stack is mapped executable, and the data segment is mapped
non-executable, according to /proc/self/maps which reflects the
PROT_EXEC request.  But in fact because of hardware limitations,
despite the "rw-p" my data segment is actually executable.
If you map a segment without PROT_EXEC on Alpha, using a kernel newer
than 1.1.84, you'll get a non-executable mapping.  That's what I mean
when I say the Alpha maps data without executable permission.  The ELF
loader appears to ask for exec permission anyway, which is another
thing entirely.
