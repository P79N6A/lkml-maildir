Now that the GDT is a full page for each CPU there's plenty of space
for all kinds of per-cpu data, even if we waste 75% of it.  LSL seems
pretty fast; I got 13 clocks for the whole lsl/jnz/and sequence on K8
and 21 clocks on PII.  Myabe you can test P4?

I can't write those.

Andi has x86_64 patches in his tree and is considering this method for
ia32 support.
