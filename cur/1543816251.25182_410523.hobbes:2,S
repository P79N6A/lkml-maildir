I'm less sure. It's what the function does, and I can see very valid usage models for it;
to detect that a certain type is NOT present. And the code is clearly written with that goal
in mind at least. I'm tempted to write a real range function but I also was hoping to avoid
doing that, since for the MCFG test it really is a bit overkill.
