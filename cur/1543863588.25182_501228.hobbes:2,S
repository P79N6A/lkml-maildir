Thanks for your reply.
But more details are appreciated. Actually I checked linkage.h before
I sent last email. Looks like "fastcall" is used to direct the
compiler to put the first 3 parameters into registers instead of
stack. But I just don't understand why that causes "general protection
fault".
I am writing a new file system on Linux platform. So I thought this is
the right email list where I can discuss Linux kernel developing
questions. Is this email list only used to post patches and report
bugs? If so, I will stay away.
