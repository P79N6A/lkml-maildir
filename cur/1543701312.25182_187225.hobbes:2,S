This is my sample syscall implementation
---
asmlinkage int sys_mysyscall (int arg1, char * arg2)
{
	char * argv[2], * envp[3];
	
	argv[0] = "/usr/test";  //this program does nothing, simply returns
0
	argv[1] = 0;
	
	envp[0] = "HOME=/";
	envp[1] = "PATH=/bin:/sbin/:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin";
	envp[2] = 0;
	call_usermodehelper (argv[0], argv, envp);  //calling this way leads
to memory leak in kernel.
	return 1;
}

Is there any alternative to call_usermodehelper in kernel 2.4.20?
Any suggestion of patch will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks & regards,
Srikumar
