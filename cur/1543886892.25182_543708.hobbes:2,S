That's not correct.  Just as today, it's entirely trackable.  We've had
the sign-off thing for quite a long time, and we've also had the ARM
patch system for ages.  That's what the "2271/3" number means.

First submitted on 22 November 2004 by Nicolas.  Went through a couple
of revisions until 2271/3 which was committed on 27 November 2004.  No
indication that the code was done by anyone other than Nicolas, though
maybe Nico didn't add appropriate creditation to the real authors.
Slap Wrist if we're missing the proper creditation!
