Subject: Using kill_fasync for sig >= SIGRTMIN ?

I'm using kernel 2.4.20.
Is it possible to kill_fasync a signal >= SIGRTMIN to asynchronously notify
a user of the availability of data from a driver ? 
It seems to me the code always sends a SIGIO instead.
Looking at fs/fnctl.c and kernel/signal.c, it appears to fail in
send_sig_info().
signal chosen is 40 ( lower than 64 on i386 )
bad_signal() , should not fail, except if kernel mode is not allowed to send
RT signals ...
then deliver_signal is called, which in turns call send_signal() .
rtsig-nr = 0  , rtsig-max = 1024, there is no reason to fail...
Any explanation would help, thank you.
Please CC me.
