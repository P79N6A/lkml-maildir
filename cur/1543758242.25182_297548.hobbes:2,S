Just to make it 100% clear: I don't particularly like to work around
the shortcomings of the ARM toolchain by adding hacks to the kernel.
It should be first and foremost up to the toolchain people to fix the
problem.  If someone maintaining the ARM toolchain could be persuaded
to maintain a bugfix only branch, this would be a huge step forwards.
