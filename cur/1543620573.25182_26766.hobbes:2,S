Just get the .ssh/id_dsa.pub from the client you want to allow in without 
a password and copy it inside .ssh/authorized_keys2 in the server.
ssh-agent is useful if you protect your keys with a password so that you
don't have to retype the password to unblock you own key over and over.  
Nothing to do with accessing other sites.
If you need any help just tell me.
