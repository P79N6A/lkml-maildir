Subject: KERN_ERR for missing codecs?

Hello!
The following piece of code from drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c would print a
kernel error message:
        if ((audio = codec->codec_read(codec, AC97_RESET)) & 0x8000) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "ac97_codec: %s ac97 codec not present\n",
                       codec->id ? "Secondary" : "Primary");
                return 0;
        }
I believe that the kernel should not worry _so_ much about things that
don't exist on the system. KERN_ERR is normally used for really serious
problem.
Probably this error indicates that the driver of a particular card expects
more codecs than there are. But it's a issue of that driver - some of them
may refuse to load, some of them may print error messages. It depends on
what that driver expects.
I suggest removing that printk - the sound card drivers that care about
codecs already print appropriate messages (maestro3.c, via82cxxx_audio.c).
Some drivers that don't care (trident.c, ymfpci.c) because they are
probing more than one codec.
Or at least that KERN_ERR could be downgraded to KERN_WARNING.
