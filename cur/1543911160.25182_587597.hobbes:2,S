Most people get it right, so there must be a solution available that
doesn't involve changing the kernel. ;-)
Most likely the problem is that you cut'n'paste your patches into your  
email client (or the editor your email client opens). If your client has 
some "Insert File" functionality use this instead.

Open source email clients I have personally used to send patches are 
(al)pine with the included pico as editor and mutt with nano as editor, 
but it might be harder to find ones that don't work than ones that do 
work...
