    Now that the -rt patch has been first release in the broken-out version, 
let me tell you that the following 3 patches in the series can be just 
annihilated:
preempt-irqs-ppc-ack-irq-fixups.patch
preempt-irqs-ppc-fix-b5.patch
preempt-irqs-ppc-fix-more-fasteoi.patch
as all that the latter two are doing is undoing the former one.
WBR, Sergei
