Nonetheless, with your first patch and my patch, the system starts off
using the old method of trying to allocate 8 frames buffer (which is
essential for performance) and falls back to the current (as of
test13-pre2) way in low/fragmented memory situations. To me, that's
better than either the previous or the current method, with the slight
increased cost of the failed kmalloc every time in the low/fragmented
memory case.  BTW, have you gotten reports of that kmalloc failing for
people?  I've been ripping audio with every kernel since pre4 and have
never had a failure.  Granted, I put 'workstation' loads on my machine,
but I run some benchmarks from time-to-time, put memory pressure on
etc.  (H*ll, just netscape alone is memory pressure enough :-).
I just don't want to have to patch every kernel I run from here to
eternity.  Call me selfish.
