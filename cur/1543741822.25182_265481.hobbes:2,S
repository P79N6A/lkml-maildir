Well, as soon as the boot scripts "initializes" an LVM2 volume group;
just create one with vgcreate(8) from the lvm2 tools (I guess it'd fail under
faulty kernels like the latest -mm's).
Then boot 2.6.9-mm1 or 2.6.10-rc1-mm1, either the distro specific init scripts
will yield an error (No volume groups found), or just issue 'vgchange -a y',
to activate all available volume groups, and it will fail with the above error.
In my case, no kernel messages in dmesg related to these errors.
