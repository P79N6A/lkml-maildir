Take a look at the latest code in linux-2.5.66/drivers/video/aty/aty128fb.c
It no longer looks specifically for "R128". Also see the function 
aty128_map_ROM() for an example of how the ROM resource assigned 
automatically in the latest code.
You could add this to the 2.4 code or try 2.5. I imagine the new driver 
code will eventually get backported to 2.4 once it is considered stable.
