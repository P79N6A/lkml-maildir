 I see "EMFILE", it's still supported by the latest mount(8).

 Copy & past from mount-0.99.2:
  /* Mount failed, complain, but don't die.  */
  switch (mnt_err)
    {
    case EPERM:
      if (geteuid() == 0)
	error ("mount: mount point %s is not a directory", node);
      else
	error ("mount: must be superuser to use mount");
      break;
    case EBUSY:
      error ("mount: wrong fs type, %s already mounted, %s busy, "
	"or other error", spec, node);
      break;
    case ENOENT:
      error ("mount: mount point %s does not exist", node); break;
    case ENOTDIR:
      error ("mount: mount point %s is not a directory", node); break;
    case EINVAL:
      error ("mount: %s not a mount point", spec); break;
    case EMFILE:
      error ("mount table full"); break;
    case EIO:
      error ("mount: %s: can't read superblock", spec); break;
    case ENODEV:
      error ("mount: fs type %s not supported by kernel", type); break;
    case ENOTBLK:
      error ("mount: %s is not a block device", spec); break;
    case ENXIO:
      error ("mount: %s is not a valid block device", spec); break;
    case EACCES:
      error ("mount: block device %s is not permitted on its filesystem", spec);
      break;
    default:
      error ("mount: %s", strerror (mnt_err)); break;
    }
