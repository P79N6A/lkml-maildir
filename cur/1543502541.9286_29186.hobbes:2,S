No, you don't want /proc/self/fd unless it's really necessary (setuid)
because it loses the path information which is going to break some scripts.
This loss is not important for setuid scripts (they didn't work before
anyway).
And using a /proc/self/<scriptname> trick is not enough either.
The whole path might be useful (to find other files in the same dir as the
scripts, ...)
