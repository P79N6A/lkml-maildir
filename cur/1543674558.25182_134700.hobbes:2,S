Now try:
# time ps auwx > /dev/null
Here it takes more than two seconds :) That's because ps is trying to 
access /dev/pts[0-9]+ first. That results in a attempt to insert a 
module for that device.
Because I was getting tired of this i made a quick hack:
     # some confusion with devfsd and devpts in 2.5. Quick hack:
     for i in `seq 0 512` ; do  ln -s /dev/pts/$i /dev/pts$i 2>&1 > 
/dev/null ; done 2>&1 > /dev/null
..in my init scripts.
Using devfs (and devfsd) and devpts.
This is "new" in 2.5.68 and 69 :)
