The whole patch affects just one line in one Kconfig file outside
arch/bluefin, so I don't see a reason why this needs to be tied into the
two-week-window thing.  I figure that if we can get it into -mm within a
few weeks we'll be OK for 2.6.17.
But that depends upon review comments.  My ten-minute-peek was not
sufficient.  But given this discussion and its probably appearance in -mm,
I'd expect a few more people will get in there and help.
We'll see how it goes.
