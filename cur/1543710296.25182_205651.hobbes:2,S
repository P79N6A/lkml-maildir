Grrr,
this is driving me nuts. Now with the same kernel/config I used 
yesterday I again have 51°C of idle temp after 2h of uptime. Yesterday I 
had 12h of uptime and at the end temp was at 39°C. I slowly begin to 
think that the sensors show something wrong? At least I can't explain 
the difference. Yesterday after going back to tsc timer, temp 
immedeatley started dropping after booting up that kernel. I will now 
compile 2.6.3 again and see whether temp starts dropping after boot.
I am really starting to get frustrated...
