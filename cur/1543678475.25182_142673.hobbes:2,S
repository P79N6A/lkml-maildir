Hm, you shouldn't possibly hire in management of one of the several SAP
consultant companies ;-)

Well, Larry, probably you should not wonder about not getting suggestions how
to put M$ out of business by consulting for a bitkeeper-like software
application. I guess that wouldn't really work out.
If you are looking for competing with M$ you should call up one of the linux
distributors and merge with them. It does not really look like RH or SuSE do
all that bad (to name examples). And I do believe they could earn a lot more
bucks if (even) more focus is put on consulting.
To my knowledge a consulting company can scale just as well as a (software)
manufacturing company. For sure this type of business is more complex, but
nevertheless I can very well see more income per customer by service contracts
or the like. I mean this is an original M$ statement: "compared to the TCO the
prizing of our product is not interesting", which basically reads: you have to
spend the big bucks _after_ you bought the software...
Which sums up to the point where M$ and open source people basically tell you
the same thing, only you are no believer (don't take this as critics).
Regards,
Stephan
