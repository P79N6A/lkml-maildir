It has an edge connector, a full 64-bit ribbon connector, and
a 32-bit ribon connector.  As far as I can tell, there are no
shared signals.
It is made by Adex electronics, and is part number:  P/NPCITX3S1 884-335-185
I tried two different systems, and the problem is identical, so I believe
it is not a hardware manufacturing glitch.  It may be a hardware design
issue in either the riser or the motherboard.  Or a BIOS PCI irq mapping
problem...
