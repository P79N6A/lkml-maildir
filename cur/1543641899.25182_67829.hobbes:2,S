I think I will have to take this back.  It looks like even the old kernel
treats the game server as a background process, but as you said, it does
not make such a big difference.  Another change is that the prio value 
varies very quickly over time (as seen in top).  I do not recall seeing 
that using the O(1)-scheduler.
But I still do not understand why the process is classified as
non-interactive...  Around 20 times per second it does a nanosleep for
1 ms which takes around 40 ms in reality.  (Seeing this makes me believe 
that I should try to increase HZ, but that is a separate issue.)
