Why must we use jiffies to tell when a timer expires? Honestly I'd like
to see xtime and jiffies both disappear, but I'm not very familiar w/
the soft-timer code, so forgive me if I'm misunderstanding. 
So instead of calculating delta_jiffies, just mark the timer to expire
at B. Then each interrupt, you use get_fast_timestamp() to decide if now
is greater then B. If so, expire it. 
Then we can look at being able to program timer interrupts to occur as
close as possible to the next soft-timer's expiration time.
