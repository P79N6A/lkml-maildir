Subject: IRQ off latency of printk is very high

I've been looking at 'IRQ off' latency in the Linux kernel, on
version 2.6.22 for target using an ARM processor.
I use a serial console, at 115200 bps.
I've noticed that calls to printk disable interrupts for
excessively long times.  I have a long test printk of
over 200 chars, that holds interrupts off for 24 milliseconds.
The kernel drops ticks in this case.  I changed to HZ=1000
to more easily see the dropped ticks, and I'm losing about
23 ticks (no surprise there).
I see long interrupt off periods for vprintk and release_console_sem,
both in kernel/printk.c
Results with HRT disabled, HZ=1000:
Below is output from a test printk I inserted into sys_sync().
I have PRINTK_TIMES turned on.
/proc # sync
[ 2292.851106] I'm now in the sys_sync system call, performing an extremely long
 printk with lots of words that go on and on and on and if it gets any longer I
just might scream but that's beside the point, as a test of interrupt disable ti
me for the printk system itself.
[ 2292.895751] interval=44816825, jiffies=22
[ 2292.904529] This is a shorter string - will we drop jiffies here??
[ 2292.933729] interval=29173886, jiffies=23
/proc # sync
[ 2296.353092] I'm now in the sys_sync system call, performing an extremely long
 printk with lots of words that go on and on and on and if it gets any longer I
just might scream but that's beside the point, as a test of interrupt disable ti
me for the printk system itself.
[ 2296.377637] interval=24573237, jiffies=1
[ 2296.381856] This is a shorter string - will we drop jiffies here??
[ 2296.388356] interval=6488141, jiffies=1
--------------------------
Data from irq_latency measurement tool
Notes:
 * 24 ms vprintk = long printk
 * 6 ms printk = shorter printk
 * 4 ms printk = timing report printks
 * I don't know what the heck that preempt_schedule_irq is doing in there.
 I only saw that once, on this test.

It looks like vprintk() holds off interrupts for the entire
duration of outputting the data to the serial console.
release_console_sem() appears to as well.
The local_irq_save and restore appear to have been added
in February, 2007 by Mathieu.
Are these are really needed, with all this other locking
going on?  Any ideas for fixing this?
