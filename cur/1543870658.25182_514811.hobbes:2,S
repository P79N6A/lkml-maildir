The plan is the typical layered approach to enabling.  Post the basic
enabling patch, followed by a patch or software to actually exercise the
feature.
The code to exercise the feature is complicated by the fact that the
memory will need re-training as it comes out of low power state.  The
code doing this is still a bit confidential.
I have the base enabling patch ready for RFC review.
I'm working on the RFC now.

I think so, but need to double check with the HW folks.
Technically, the dims could be powered off, and put into 2 different low
power non-destructive states.  (standby and suspend), but putting them
in a low power non-destructive mode has much less latency and provides
good bang for the buck or LOC change needed to make work.
Which lower power mode an application chooses will depend on latency
tolerances of the app.  For the POC activities we are looking at we are
targeting the lower latency option, but that doesn't lock out folks from
trying to do something with the other options.
