This is one of the rare cases where the usage of KERNEL_VERSION is valid. 
This is the code there:
#include <linux/version.h>      /* for KERNEL_VERSION MACRO     */
#define RADIO_VERSION KERNEL_VERSION(0,7,7)
This macro is required by V4L API to indicate the module version.
One possible solution would be to fork KERNEL_VERSION into something like 
V4L_VERSION, and replace it on drivers/media/video/* and 
drivers/media/radio/*.
Yet, I'm not sure if it would be nice to have two macros with the same 
code.
