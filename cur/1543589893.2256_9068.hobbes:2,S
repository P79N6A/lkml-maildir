Ok, this is not a patch per se, just a description of what I think should
work..
In include/asm-i386/pci.h, change the line
	#define PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM		0x10000000
into
	extern unsigned long pci_mem_start;
	#define PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM		(pci_mem_start)
In arch/i386/kernel/setup.c, at the very end of the
"setup_arch()" function, add
	/* Start PCI allocations at max_low_memory rounded up to 1MB */
	pci_mem_start = ((max_low_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) + 0xfffff) & ~0xfffff;
and somewhere in the same file, add the actual variable:
	unsigned long pci_mem_start = 0x10000000;
and you're done. Does this work for you?
Alan, do you have access to that Dell laptop to test? The thing looks
obvious, but I'd rather not apply it to my tree until somebody sends me
the above back as a tested patch.. Call me a sissy.
