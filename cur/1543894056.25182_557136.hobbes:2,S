Possibly. In fact, myapp receives a 40 Mbit/s stream.

I went hunting, and found a memory leak in our syslogd. Doh!

I didn't mention that there is no swap on this system.

Are you referring to these /proc/sys/vm entries?
# cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
0
# cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
50
Are you suggesting I set overcommit_memory to 2?
The manual states:
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode.
Values are:
   0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
   1: always overcommit, never check
   2: always check, never overcommit
In mode 0, calls of mmap(2) with MAP_NORESERVE set are not checked, and 
the default check is very weak, leading to the risk of getting a process 
"OOM-killed". Under Linux 2.4 any non-zero value implies mode 1. In mode 
2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space on the 
system is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)), where SS is the size of the 
swap space, and RAM is the size of the physical memory, and r is the 
contents of the file /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio.
In my case, SS=0 and RAM=256MB.
If I understand correctly, if I set ratio to 50, then processes can only 
address 128MB. I'd be, in effect, reserving 128MB for the kernel, right?
Are there other entries in /proc/sys/vm I should be playing with? :-)
