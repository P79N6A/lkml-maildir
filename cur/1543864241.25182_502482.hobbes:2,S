No, I don't think so. I meant the PCI Interrupt Pin register and not the  
Interrupt line register. I do know, that the latter contains a platform  
dependent interrupt assignment. In the former a device states which  
interrupt "trace" the device is connected to (Int A-D).
Perhaps you take at look at the code, I think, it's dealing with the  
register I described (Interrupt pin).
Linus stated his opinion about the patch and thinks, it should be well  
tested in -mm kernel, because it might break devices, which do not comply  
to the PCI spec.
I second that. If there're indeed devices out there, which violate the  
spec in this point, the patch would hurt more, than it's doing any good.
As I wrote in my first message, the consequences of this rather small bug  
(if it is one and not a workaround for bad devices) are harmless.
Regards,
Andreas
