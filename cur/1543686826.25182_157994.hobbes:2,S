True - but there are a million and one ways of similarly DoSing a box;
an option to log programs terminated by a bad uncaught signal would seem
useful to me; at least one of which could be as a sign of someone trying
out buffer overrun type attacks on a system; and just as a diagnostic
to catch apps that go pop when you aren't expecting them too.
(I seem to remember ARM Linux actually does log user exceptions and very
useful it is too).
