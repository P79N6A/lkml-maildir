Subject: [ANNOUNCE] HotPlug CPU patch against 2.5.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
The Hotplug CPU patch for 2.5.0 is uploaded.
  
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lhcs/
This patch works on s390, s390x, x86 and ia64 architectures.
It can also be applied against 2.4.16 with a little modification.
Down CPU
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/cpu/<id>/online
Up CPU
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/cpu/<id>/online
For ia64, number of CPUs to be initialized can be
specified with "initcpus=<num>" option for elilo.
With using the option, you can test real hot-add CPU
function without a HW ready for hotplug.
Thanks,
Kimi
