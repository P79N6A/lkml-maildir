Depends on what the cpu_intensive_process does. If it tries to allocate 
lots of memory, maybe. If it's _just_ CPU (as in `perl -e '1 while 1'`), 
you get a chance that you can input some commands on a terminal to kill it.
SCHED_FIFO'ing or SCHED_RR'ing such a process is sudden death of course.

Why would you need it to run at -20 anyway?

In case of md5sum: it should not be. At least you should have been able to 
unblank the console pressing any key, or have sysrq available.

Sysrq+T (and/or +P) will tell you where the CPU is running.
