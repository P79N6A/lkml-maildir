Why RTT_ALPHA and RTTVAR_BETA, and not just RTT_BETA? Or even RTO_xxx?
Is there any reason to change them, ever? What happens if you change them?
Restrictions on values? All this should go with such a patch IMHO (at least
pointers to relevant discussion).
Must go over it with a fine comb to make sure no unrelated 2 or 3 got
replaced... out of my league, sorry.
Your patch is MIME-mangled, =3D, =20, =\n shows up all over the place here.
