hm, does the patch below help?
If not then please try to capture the full oops via serial logging, or 
if it's not possible, here are some guidelines wrt. how to minimize work 
when writing down oopses by hand:
1)
write down the EIP of the crash, and do:
	objdump -d vmlinux > vmlinux.asm
	grep -C 100 c0xxxxxx vmlinux.asm > toingo.asm
c0xxxxxx is the EIP of the oops. This way i'll know precisely which 
instruction crashed, and can match it up in my kernel image, even if i 
have a different .config and different build environment.
2)
Or write down the 'EIP is at ...' line plus ~10 bytes of the 'Code: ' 
line of the oops too, starting at the byte that is enclosed by <>. This 
info is enough in most cases.
