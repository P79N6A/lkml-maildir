Hello
Recently while copying large files (>10mb) as a normal user between my root and windows partitions
my system has essentially locked up.  My system is Debian 2.1 with a few upgrades.
INIT goes to 100% cpu usage and only a hard reboot seems possible.
There is no oops generated but the following error message prints repeatedly:
"ll_rw_block: device 03:01: only 512-char blocks implemented (4096)"
I hope this is enough information to be useful.
But if it isn't I will provide what more i can.
Thanks for your time,
Michael O'Cleirigh
