actually i think its a good idea to uncouple the atm
devices and the vcc.  while the vcc is useless w/o the
atm dev, there are quite a few resources tied to the vcc
(via sk side).  not having them seperate orignally led
to the 'nodev' atm device as a place to keep track of 
vcc that are going away.
once the atm device/vcc are uncoupled they can easily be
converted to a net device.  this keeps me from needing to
replicate the net device code (particularly the sysfs
stuff -- or so i hope).   netdevices already have a handy
register/unregister that works (and will keep working).
why would i want to duplicate the net device work?
