Ok, let me try again!
The primary communication needs to be high-speed above all else.  The amount of
data that needs to be sent is rather small, typically just a small structure.
However, there will be plenty of pointers in these structures, and these
pointers mostly point to buffers of about 1-8KB.  Since the kernel is
monolothic, I don't expect there to be a need to translate virtual addresses.
As for how often, these calls are made probably as much as 50 times a second,
but irregularly.  One of the drivers involved is attached to the VM, so it will
need to pass data along as often as the VM is called.
