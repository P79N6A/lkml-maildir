Subject: [patch] sched: introduce SD_BALANCE_FORK for ht/mc/smp domains
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Introduce SD_BALANCE_FORK for HT/MC/SMP domains.
For HT/MC, as caches are shared, SD_BALANCE_FORK is the right thing to do.
Given that NUMA domain already has this flag and the
scheduler currently doesn't have the concept of running threads belonging
to a process as close as possible(i.e., forking may keep close, but periodic
balance later will likely take them far away), introduce SD_BALANCE_FORK
for SMP domain too.
