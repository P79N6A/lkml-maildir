Hi!
>   * There's a writeable sysfs "wakeup" file, with one of two values:
>       - "enabled", when the policy is to allow wakeup
>       - "disabled", when the policy is not to allow it
>       - "" if the device can't currently issue wakeups
Could we either get "not-supported" value here, or remove the file if it is not
supported? Having empty file is ugly...
