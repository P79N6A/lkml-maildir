Well depends on what you mean by working set.
In our memory manager, there is a point where often used
"file cache" (ie. unmapped cache) is considered preferable
to unused or little used "application memory" (mapped
memory).
There will be a point where even the most swap phobic desktop
users will want to start swapping.
I missed the description of your exact problem... was it in
this thread somewhere? Testing 2.6 would be appreciated if
possible too.
