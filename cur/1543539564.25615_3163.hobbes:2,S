NUMA is not necessarily cache coherent. Being coherent scales very poorly.
Until a port to a NUMA machine exists, it's probably best to ignore the
issue. Locking on NUMA will probably use some non-memory-based form of
messaging.

The things that need to be protected by locks and memory barriers on SMP
will likely still need protection on NUMA. The races are more or less the
same, the windows will just be wider.

I'm not sure what your auditing structure looks like but I think a lock of
some form is unavoidable. For instance, a child process may need to
propagate something to the parent's audit trail on exit, but the parent is
running on the other CPU. It's probably best to begin with a single audit
lock or even the big kernel lock for simplicity.
