With source compatibility you get the ABI at compile time.  This is how
Linux handles internal interfaces.  This is about an internal interface
between kernel and a platform layer.  The raw hypervisor interface is
hidden (translations done in the platform layer), and the hypervisor
needs to provide stable ABI.

It's the very notion of creating such a large internal binary compatible
interface.

You could compile all platform layers you want to support with the kernel.
