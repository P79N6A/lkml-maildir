_Ouch_.  Then I have to agree with Martin - it's a blacklist time.  There's
not much partition code could do with that - you really have a partition
with a chunk that _can't_ be handled by 1Kb request.
Old code (pretty much by accident) hid it from you, so I'd suggest just
decrementing partition size - it's not that you had anything in that last
half-Kb.  At least nothing that could be accessed by old kernels.
