Sorry - you are right. Userspace doesn't need to understand kernel
resources. It just needs some sort of handle so it can talk
to the device in whatever way is appropriate. I was thinking
the resource content (which happens to be CPU View of a BAR)
could be that handle.

What is wrong with reading the BAR?
Is the "IO View" needed in the performance path someplace?
It should be trivial since config space is exported via /sys and /proc.
libpci probably already has everything that's needed.
