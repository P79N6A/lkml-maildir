If you are saving the pci device point then yes you should. If you are
using pci_module_init() and the hotplug interface instead then it may
not be neccessary.

Its up to you how you implement this. One requirement I suspect would be
that the boards have unique serial numbers. Most drivers do not retain
state if someone unplugs a board, moves it and plugs it back in. Instead
they report the old device as "gone" and let user space sort it out
