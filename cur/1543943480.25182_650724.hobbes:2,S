I think that's why he said he "Wasn't Sure" - as was pointed out in another 
post, the Lexmark ruling appears to apply for more than the "interface" 
portion of the ruling.
And Alan, while it might be legal to make the changes, making them for the 
sole purpose of using them in a proprietary module - when the people who 
actually hold the copyright have said "I think this is so core to the kernel 
that anything using it is a derivative work" - is what he thought *MIGHT* be 
legally actionable under the DMCA.
