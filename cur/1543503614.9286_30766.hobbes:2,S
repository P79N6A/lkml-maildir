Actually sysctl allows converting everything, if you just put in a pointer to
your own handling function [of course for ms it should be put into sysctl.c
as a generic mechanism]. proc_dointvec is just a default.

At least there is already Ulrich Windl's "nanokernel" patch around, based
on the BSD NTP reference work. So far it doesn't seem to have a nano
"add_timer", but it probably wouldn't be too hard to add (and will be needed
anyways for POSIX timers)
