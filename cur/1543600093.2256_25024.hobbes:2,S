Waiting uninterruptibly on a local device is somewhat saner than waiting
uninterruptibly on a network server. If you ignore the cases where we end up
in D state waiting for a removable medium which has been removed, of course.
These days, disk technology is sufficiently complex that the cop-out of 
saying "nothing will ever go wrong, let's not bother to implement the 
cleanup code" is probably no longer appropriate even there.
