Subject: [linux-usb-devel] [FEATURE REQUEST] Transparent hot plugging of root file system on portable storage devices.

Hi,
I would like to request a feature in the Linux kernel that would allow
a user to unplug a live read-only root file system which exists on a
detachable storage device such as a USB key drive. The desired
behavior is that once the same device is reattached to the computer
the user can continue work transparently without having to reboot.
Having such a feature is becoming more important with advances in
detachable solid state drive technology.
Having the root FS on a wireless storage device such as D.A.V.E.
(

)
would require such a feature in the kernel in case the wireless
connection between the storage device and the computer is temporarily
lost. The user should have the ability to continue work transparently
once the wireless connection is reestablished.
Thank you,
Raymano G.
