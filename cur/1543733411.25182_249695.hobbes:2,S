Ok, first sorry for the late reply. I'm working on a vfs-based 
union-mount implementation for linux. The focus is on the basic 
functionality explained by McKusick [1] without a need for a new 
separate filesystem, without options like "before". "after", "in 
between" or something like that, with permanent whiteouts if the fstype 
supports them. For the copyup I plan to use Jörn's patch.
At the moment some basic stuff (actually the unions) is working, so you 
actually can "see" something but I don't think that the patches are 
ready for being posted now. Please relax and wait a few weeks because I 
have to go back to university for some final exams. After that I'm back 
for some more full-time hacking on union-mounts.
