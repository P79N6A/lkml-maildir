Don't forget that 2^20 > 10^6, hence if you really want units of
microseconds, you actually only need to save 3 bytes worth of data per
timestamp.
For the purposes of NFS, however the 'microseconds' field doesn't
actually have to mean anything. It's just used as a cookie.
Furthermore, only the mtime field, and to a limited extent the ctime
field, are used for attribute consistency checking.
If NFS was the only concern therefore, you would get far on just
saving one extra 24-bit field.
Cheers,
