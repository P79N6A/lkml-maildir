I upgraded to samba 2.0.3 as suggested, and the kernel still is
returning errors when I try to access the mounted share after a large
amount of times (less than the 20 hours someone reported).
From the mount/unmount end, I get the following:
root:reliant me2v$ mount | grep WINNT
//WINNT/C$ on /home/me2v/mounts type smbfs (0)
root:reliant me2v$ ls mounts
ls: mounts: Input/output error
root:reliant me2v$ smbumount mounts
Could not open mounts: Input/output error
root:reliant me2v$ umount mounts
root:reliant me2v$
As you see, umount works, but smbumount, I had thought was what normal
users (as opposed to root) were supposed to use.  I did all the above
(except the umount) as a normal user, also, with the same results.
From /var/log/messages:
Mar 25 10:12:18 reliant kernel: smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
Mar 25 10:12:45 reliant last message repeated 3 times
I'm not quite sure how to diagnose this problem and fix it.  Any
suggestions would be welcome.
