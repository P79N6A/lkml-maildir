I just tried a kernel with this patch but still have the same troubles
on insertion of a Cisco Aironet 340 card in my Ti PowerBook. 
This is what I get in the kernel message log:
cs: unable to map card memory!
cs: unable to map card memory!
I believe this worked at the point when I got this notebook but didn't
have the AirPort card builtin so maybe this is the culprit;
unfortunately I'm not in the mood to disassemble the notebook again
to verify that.
Ideas?
