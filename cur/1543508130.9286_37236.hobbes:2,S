Hear, hear.
I've created a patch that flattens out the IPV4 statistics into individual
longs retrievable via sysctl (so you can still find them in /proc if you
want them there) that I mean to hack into UCD SNMP at some point, for just
this reason (among others).
There's still a problem though, if I understand sysctl's argument
structure:  you can only fetch (or set) one thing at a time.  That means
that a monitoring tool could be causing quite a lot of context-switching.
A better way would be (say) a sysctln() that would take a whole list of
items and return them all in a single pair of context switches.
(*Setting* N items in one call leads to difficulties with partial success,
so maybe it should be a read-only sysjustshowmen(). :-)

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
