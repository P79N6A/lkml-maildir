ok - the loop-device-problem is solved by workaround (thanks for the 
asisstence - btw. "cat /dev/zero >/dev/loop" is also helpful) - 
but now I've got a new one:
whenever I try to build a root/boot-disk with a 2.3.xx-er kernel, I'll get an 
Oops:
after kernel-loading and startup-messages
...
...
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000030
 printing eip:
c012fb51
*pde = 0000000000
Oops:  0000
CPU:   0
EIP:   0010:[c012fb51]
EFLAGS: 00010202
...
I've build several thousends of root/boot-disks with 2.0.xx and 2.2.xx 
kernels - any hints or ideas ?
best regards
ralf
