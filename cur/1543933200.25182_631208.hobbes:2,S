Can we please have the hardcoded 8192 replaced with a proper constant.
I assume this is PAGESIZE?
See hwat other archs does to make PAGESIZE available for assembly
files and ldscripts. The macro AC is the key point here.
And then please explain why it make a diffrence to put the
alignment in a section like you do.
I do not see it used in the other archs.
