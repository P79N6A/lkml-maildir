In fact the block layer already does attempt to do what Linus describes.
We queue the events for the target cpu, and then do:
        local_irq_save(flags);
        list = &__get_cpu_var(blk_cpu_done);
        list_add_tail(&rq->csd.list, list);
        if (list->next == &rq->csd.list)
                raise_softirq_irqoff(BLOCK_SOFTIRQ);
thus only triggering a new softirq interrupt, if the preceeding one
hasn't run already. So this is done for the block layer
trigger_softirq() part, but could be provided by the lower layer as well
instead.

As far as I remember, it was just the way to allocate memory for the
non-wait case. The per-cpu single csd will limit you to a single pending
entry on the cpu queue, you could have more (like the block layer will
do) and get a nice batching effect for ipi busy workloads instead of a
1:1 mapping between work and ipi's fired.
