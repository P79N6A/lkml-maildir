Subject: page-flags.h pollution?

In the 2.5.3x kernel, what's the point of defining pte_chain_lock()
and pte_chain_unlock() in page-flags.h?  These two routines make it
impossible to include page-flags.h on it's own, because they require
"struct page" to be defined (and a forward declaration isn't
sufficient either).  This can introduce rather annoying circular
include-file dependencies.
