Cool. Not sure if I like the introduction of poolbits. My personal
preference would be to s/poolwords/words/ and just use ->words*32, since
foo->foomember is a throwback to pre-ANSI compilers with a flat namespace
for structure members. Note that we don't bother prefixing tap*.
If not, at least put poolbits in the structure first...

                ^^^^^
...because it's not as confusing comparing the polynomial in the comment
to the initializer.
