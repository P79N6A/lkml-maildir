yes, the ALSA fix is in (don't know which -bk it was
added) but it works fine with -bk13 as
pci_disable_device now is in there.
Boris, when we go into S3 mode, the drivebay light
remains on, draining power.. How can this be shut off
when we enter S3? aside from manually shutting the LED
off before suspend. Any code hooks we can trigger apon
entering S3?
