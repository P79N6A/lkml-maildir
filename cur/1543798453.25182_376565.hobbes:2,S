wbsd can do 1 to 4087 (it wants CRC bytes in the size so it goes to 4095
including those). Which means I probably set incorrect sg limits... I
guess I should fix that.
sdhci, which I'm currently developing, can do up to 0x7FFF. The register
is 16-bits, but the upper bit never sticks so I assume it cannot be used.
