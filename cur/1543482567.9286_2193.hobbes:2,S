int main(void)

'try' generates core with 0600 permission
% ldd ./core

kernel gives warning:
kernel: free_one_pmd: bad directory entry 000001e3
kernel: stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU#1)
just before dying
glibc 2.0.7-19 RH 5.1
pgcc 1.0.3
Dell Optiplex dual PPro 200MHz
the kernel also generates lots of "spurious APIC interrupt
warning that should never happen".
