Why?  I see no problem with the semantics, "you remove an active floppy,
all outstanding activity is lost."  As long as the kernel doesn't defer
IO unnecessarily, that's just fine.
The old behaviour of some desktop OSes of tracking multiple "mounted"
floppies at once arose in the times when many machines had nothing
_except_ floppy drives, and good management of multiple concurrent
floppies was very important.  That no longer applies.

But I don't.  A removed floppy is _gone_.

But on a multi-user OS, it's simply not always possible to do that, and
I haven't seen a convincing reason why it is necessary.
