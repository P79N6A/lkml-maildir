Robert Hancock explained what's wrong with your proposal of:
+	if (off)
+		return 0;
For an alternative that seems to work better, see the processing
behind the /proc/<pid>/cpuset file, by grep'ing for seq_file in
kernel/cpuset.c.
Essentially, it composes the result string on the open, and then
lets user code read and seek over that string at will.
