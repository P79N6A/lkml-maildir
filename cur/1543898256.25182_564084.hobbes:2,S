Hi
I'm using vmware and bridged networking with interface eth1.
The brigde works only when eth1 has the physical connection enabled, so
i always need to have another pc running.
with tcpdump i can see packets coming from virtual machines, but none
sent back.
I wonder if it's possibile to have the interface always "alive" (as
ifconfig reports it up) in order to have the bridge working.
I looked for some ethtool options...but nothing...
thanks for support
Patrizio
