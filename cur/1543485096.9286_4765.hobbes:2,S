yes, I also get ppp problems. And I have found the reason why my
ppp-connections with the new kernel are so slow: Every time I turn on
the APM and some features in the APM-section this happens. Without APM I
can compile in and out everything I like without consequences to speed
of ppp-connections. Perhabs this is a kernel-bug but perhabs it is my
bios which is a little bit buggy, I do not know. 
I also remember that this topic was discussed some days ago on this list
so you can lock it up in the archives.
Bye, Andreas.
