Well, at least having interrupts enabled is really nice for us on PPC
since we have this nasty chip (the PMU) that don't like at all beeing
interrupted for a long time in the middle of a message exchange.
It has caused endless trouble in the past and still, occasionally, when
you set your powerbook display bit depth to 32 and don't enable HW 
acceleration in the fbdev driver.
I hope your patch will be merged in as soon as possible :) I'll do some
tests here.
Ben.
