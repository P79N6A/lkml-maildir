Well it is for buffered writes, right? And in general it will be OK,
but if you run into queue/memory congestion when submitting the IO,
it will be locked for a lot longer than required.

That's exactly what my patch does too!

Well we do have a reference on the buffers, so in this particular case
perhaps not. But we have no mutual exclusion on the page or buffers
so I agree it could be racy against a lot of things.

block_read_full_page does the walk in order to gather up the buffers.
They then get submitted for IO via the buffer head array walk.
I prefer my patch. I don't think it is particularly complex.
