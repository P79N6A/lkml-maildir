After a look through the CVS, it seems that prior to 2.1.45 we actually
had that behaviour - for swap partitions swapoff() cared only about
major:minor.  Since 2.1.45 we really need the same dentry - not even
the same inode (i.e.
swapon /dev/sda6 && ln /dev/sda6 /dev/foo && swapoff /dev/foo
is guaranteed to fail; prior to 2.1.45 it used to work).
In other words, during the last 4 years quite a few pieces of mm/swapfile.c
had been a dead code.  Looks like we either need to restore old behaviour
or perform the amputation.  Snippet above is not the only place of that
kind.
Linus, it's your call.
