One of two things:
1: Your code is leaving the semaphore in a down'ed state
   somehow.
2: The semaphore code is leaving the semaphore in a funny
   state.
hmm.  I see from your other email that the sema_init() has 
made the problem go away.  Could you please review the code,
see if there's an imbalance somewhere?
What is parport_ieee1284_write_compat() trying to do with
the semaphore?  It will leave the semaphore in a downed
state.  Intentional?  Is this code actually being used
by the person who is having the problem?  Could this
loop be replaced by a simple sema_init()?
(As you can tell, I'm desparately avoiding having
to understand the semaphore code again :))
