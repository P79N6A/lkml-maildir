Ok, I can remove the module so it no longer is loaded ..
It is replicate able, but randomly. Seems to occur when I hammer on
the SATA drive in the system, which is running on a add-on SIL 3112a
controller card.
Anyway, driver is removed, system rebooted, ksyms logged.
I will hammer again on the system to see if it fails ...
Thanks  ...
