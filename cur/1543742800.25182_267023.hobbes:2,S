I am not able to get V0.6.2 to boot on my SMP system here. There is no 
indication as to why. It just locks. I don't see anything in the log 
that gives an indication as to why so I am only attaching the end of the 
log. If you would like all of it, just let me know. I am going to try 
building it for my SMP system now.
