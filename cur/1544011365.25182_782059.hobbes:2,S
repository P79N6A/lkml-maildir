I may give that a shot.
But it also looks like my major numbers are wrong on the actual device nodes?
brw-r-----  1 root disk   9, 0 Dec 17 19:13 0
brw-r-----  1 root disk 259, 0 Dec 17 19:13 1
brw-r-----  1 root disk 259, 1 Dec 17 19:13 2
brw-r-----  1 root disk 259, 2 Dec 17 19:13 3
Shouldn't this be 9,something, not 259?
If I change the partition type from fd to something else, and don't
allow the kernel to auto assemble, then assemble manually via mdadm,
things work right.
Any idea what could cause thee major numbers to be wrong?
