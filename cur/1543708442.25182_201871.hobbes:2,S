And you get an effective "context switch" even if you're not crossing 
process boundaries.  (it could be argued that different layers on 
seperate rings are effectively now a "process"...)

One way or another, you'd have to have a "personality".  With Linux 
there is one in the kernel, and possibly many in userspace.  You won't 
find many here that will agree it should be any other way.
