Subject: [RFC][PATCH] HZ as a config option
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/4/348

On large systems (like NUMA-Q, Intel Profusion, etc...), latency and 
user responsiveness become much less important.  The extra scheduling 
overhead caused by higher HZ is bad.
This is x86-only right now.  Is there any wider desire to tune this at 
config time?  Do any architecutures have strict rules as to what this 
can be set to?

   If in doubt, say N.
 
+CONFIG_HZ
+  This is unrelated to your processor's speed.  This variable alters
+  how often the system is asked to generate timer interrupts.  A larger
+  value can lead to a more responsive system, but also causes extra 
+  overhead from the increased number of context switches.
+
+  In older kernels, this was set to 100.  In 2.5, it was set to 1000.
+  HZ must be greater than 11 and less than 1536.
+
+  If in doubt, leave it at the default of 1000.

 CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_24_API
   This enables the /proc/sys/cpu/ sysctl interface for controlling
   CPUFreq, as known from the 2.4.-kernel patches for CPUFreq. Note
