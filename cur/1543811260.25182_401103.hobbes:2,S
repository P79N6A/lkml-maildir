I will give 2.6.16-rcX a try shortly, here is the error again (with a 
freshly patched 2.6.15.4) just to rule out any problems with the first 
time that I patched:
[ 1037.451784] ata3: translated op=0x2a ATA stat/err 0x51/04 to SCSI 
SK/ASC/ASCQ 0xb/00/00
[ 1037.451791] ata3: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
[ 1037.451796] ata3: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
[ 1517.050496] ata3: no sense translation for op=0x2a status: 0x51
[ 1517.050504] ata3: translated op=0x2a ATA stat/err 0x51/00 to SCSI 
SK/ASC/ASCQ 0x3/11/04
