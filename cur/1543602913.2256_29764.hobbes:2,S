So then you can no longer 'make modules && make modules_install', or you
have to cp or chown /usr/src/linux on a fresh install to compile your
kernel?   Doesn't sound pleasant to me.
I think the "trick" is to redirect stdout and stderr to /dev/null as well,
so that /dev/null doesn't get removed from the file system since it is
held open by the shell.
Something like:
	gcc -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null /dev/null 2>&1
Perhaps someone just forgot the I/O redirection in one of the tests?
However, I just compiled (but did not install) 2.4.10, as root, and my
/dev/null still exists...
