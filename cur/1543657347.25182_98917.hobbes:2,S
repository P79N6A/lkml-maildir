Just a heads up, as this bit me with agpgart which had a module_init()
but no module_exit() and then found itself un-unloadable[1].
I don't know if agpgart found itself in the unique position of doing
this (It only really used its _init function to clear some vars,
and printk a banner), but its something to keep an eye out for.
I fixed it by adding a null _exit function, (which later did a
sanity check just for good measure).
