I have had that same dream too, Jeff :)
Especially after spelunking through the SCSI drivers, and being amazed
that only one of them uses the, now two year old, pci_register_driver()
interface (which means that only that driver works properly in PCI
hotplug systems.)
Having someone with "taste" to run driver patches by first would have
been a great help when I started out writing them.  I've been trying to
provide that resource for the new USB drivers.
