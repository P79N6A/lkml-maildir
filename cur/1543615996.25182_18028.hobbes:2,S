Because exposing sizes of private objects is Wrong.
Now, the problems I see with Jeff's variant:
a) if you make struct inode a part of ext2_inode - WTF bother with pointer?
b) ->destroy_inode() / ->clear_inode().  Merge them - that way it's one
method.
c) get_empty_inode() must die.  Make it new_inode() and be done with that.
And have socket.c explicitly set ->i_dev to NODEV afterwards.
d) ext2/balloc.c cleanup probably should be merged before.
I can live with "maintain refcounts in common part and leave allocation/freeing
to filesystem".  It's definitely better than allocating/freeing opaque objects
in VFS using numeric fields in fs_type.
We will need to set very strict rules on passing around/storing pointers to
ext2_inode and its ilk, though.  There will be bugs when somebody just decides
that keeping such pointers might be a good idea and forgets to be nice with
->i_count.  Or decrement it manually instead of calling iput(), etc.
It _MUST_ be explicitly documented - preferably beaten into skulls.
