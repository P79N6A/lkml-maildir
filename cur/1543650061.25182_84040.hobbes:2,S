It seems to have been this way since at least 2.2.  It isn't
exclusive to the /proc/*/exe.  It applies to all symlinks in
/proc/$pid.
As near as i can tell it seems to be a
functional-equivalency carryover from 2.2.  It isn't causing
much harm but i do wonder if this is intentional and if so,
why.  I'm at a loss to see why refusing to allow non-owners
to identify a process's cwd, exe, and root would be
desireable.  The only other things we refuse are mem, fd/
and eviron, the reasons for which are obvious and the
restrictions are per-file rather than as a class.
