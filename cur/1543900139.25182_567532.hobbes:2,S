Just to make it clear Miklos.
I have seen your patch as has everyone else.
But myself, nor any other developers, are going to review your work
any faster if you do things like try to slip things in behind the
maintainer's back as you attempted to do yesterday by asking Andrew to
put your AF_UNIX garbage collector rewrite directly into his -mm tree.
If you read the netdev list, you'll see that I do not lose important
postings often if at all, and it is frequently the case that you will
in fact see me here replying to postings made weeks if not months ago.
You just need to be patient, ok?
I run my todo list in a prioritized way, and you need patience instead
of annoying me and others over and over about your patch.
Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding.
