hand transcribed oops (top bit missing from screen unfortunatly,
and box locked up solid).

Code: 0f 0b 2e 06 d6 de 54 c0 e9 d7 fe ff ff 8b 55 08 8b 5a 34 e9
Judging by the Code: line, it hit a BUG() somewhere, but the
rest of the code line looks like gibberish. Worst still, an
objdump -D of the vmlinux doesn't have the corresponding 
bytes in that order.  kernel text corruption ?
