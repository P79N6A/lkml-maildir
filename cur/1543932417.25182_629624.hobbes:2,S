I have done some tests. Firstly, I did not see the BUG with 2.6.24-rc5. 
Looking at include/linux/scatterlist.h suggested that CONFIG_DEBUG_SG has 
something to do with this. When enabled SG debugging, I also saw the BUG. 
Adding this patch solved the problem.
You can add
Acked-by: Kai Makisara <Kai.Makisara@kolumbus.fi>
if you want. This fix should be included in 2.6.24.
