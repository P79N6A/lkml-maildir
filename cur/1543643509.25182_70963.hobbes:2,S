Pktgen is independent of this particular hack.  One of the flag #defines is in the
patch to make my life easier, but it can be removed if that makes someone happier...
Right now, I am getting panics after 30 minutes running at around 250Mbps of tcp traffic to
myself over GigE nics.  But, I'm running NAPI e1000, the send-to-self hack, and
had the pktgen module loaded....  Trying to narrow it down...but so far, it looks
like memory corruption, perhaps somewhere in tcp/ip...
It can still be #ifdef'd, but some of the code just fixes the SO_BINDTODEVICE
feature, so I think that may be worth putting in anyway...
