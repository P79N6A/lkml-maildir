It's not perfect but ok. I'm running the FC4 version of Tbird 1.0.7 and
it works as it should with tabs and spaces everywhere if I don't sign
or encrypt the mail.
If I DO sign or encrypt the mail (using Enigmail+gpg) then the preformat
is effectively turned off and all tabs are converted to spaces, but
spaces are left as is.
How does the other mail clients handle it (or don't they handle signed
and/or encrypted mails?).
