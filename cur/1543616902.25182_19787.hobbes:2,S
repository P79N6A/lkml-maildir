One does begin to think that there may be a problem.  The inode,
dentry and buffer caches do involve a lot of pointer chasing,
and do tend to expose hardware problems (memory), and we've tended
to assume that's the reason for all the reports.
But there are a *lot* of reports, and the same argument applies:
the long pointer chases will expose random memory corruption caused
by a kernel bug.
It's starting to look fishy.
