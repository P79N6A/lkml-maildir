Well, I like it. Maybe I can look into it. Feel free
to bug me :-)

Please delete memory.o, rerun make bzImage, capture gcc
command used for compiling memory.c, modify it:
gcc ... -o memory.o  ->  gcc ... -S -o memory.s ...
and examine assembler code. Maybe something will stick out
(or use objdump to disassemble memory.o, I recall nice
option to produce assembler output with C code intermixed
as comments!) (send disasmed listing to me offlist).

You should aim at maxing out IDE performance.
Please find out how many sectors you read in one go.
Maybe:
# cat /proc/interrupts
# dd bs=1m count=1 if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null
# cat /proc/interrupts
and calculate how many IDE interrupts happened. (1mb = 2048 sectors)
