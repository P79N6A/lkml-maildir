Not quite.  Add such things as choice of sane identifiers.  And sane use of
local variables, while we are at it - things like twenty lines of
	foobar[(index + 1) % BLAH]->spork.vomit[12]->field_name = <expr>;
with the only difference in the field_name, except for one line where
we have a typo and see 11 instead of intended 12, are responsible for quite
a few of such overruns.
IMO the line length overruns make good warnings.  Not as in "here's a cheap
way to get more changesets", but as in "that code might have other problems
nearby" kind of heuristics.
