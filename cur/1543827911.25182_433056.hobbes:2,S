Yep, it makes collie usable.

Agreed. I just need to find out why ADCs seem to return random values.

Did we ever have working MMC with open-source drivers (on collie)? I
thought we had MMC but not SD...

Well, provided I can get bitbake to work :-).
But I sense problems... I need CF slot for bluetooth card -- irda is
not really usable. I thought I seen some 16MB gpe images... and then,
there's RAM, too.
