This is very unfortunate, because it invalidates the workaround
where I moved btfixup to "make image" stage. Unles Kai is willing
to change the way the dependencies are handled, I'm stuck.
I am talking about breaking up this:
$(sort $(vmlinux-objs)): $(SUBDIRS) ;
To make every single object (including head.o) on every other
subdirectory (even benign ones) seems a little fishy.
