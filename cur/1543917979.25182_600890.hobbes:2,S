SLAB default is order 1 so is SLUB default upstream.
SLAB does runtime detection of the amount of memory and configures the max 
order correspondingly:
from mm/slab.c:
	/*
         * Fragmentation resistance on low memory - only use bigger
         * page orders on machines with more than 32MB of memory.
         */
        if (num_physpages > (32 << 20) >> PAGE_SHIFT)
                slab_break_gfp_order = BREAK_GFP_ORDER_HI;
We could duplicate something like that for SLUB.
