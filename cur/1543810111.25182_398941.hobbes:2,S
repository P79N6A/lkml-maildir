Well of _course_ that will happen.  If we have dirty pages we need to
either keep them in memory or lose them.  If someone wants to run a massive
memory stresstest, unplug the disks in the middle of it and have the
machine serenely sail along as if nothing happened then they're being
unreasonable.

If you disconnect that then everything stops until you reconnect it, provided
all the tools needed to handle the reconnect are in the correct place - if
the system providers got that wrong then the machine is obviously toast.
Your questions boil down to "what if the user is crazy or the implementation
is buggy?".   Let's assume neither is true, OK?
