Damien> Maybe I wasn't clear:
The user-space libpci.a has headers in /usr/include/pci/pci.h
Do #include <pci/pci.h> to get at them.
On debian, at least, you need the pciutils-dev package.
Unfortunately, there are no manual pages (yet?)
And *do* look at the example code that comes with libpci.a
pci_resource_start() and so on are kernel functions; you get the same
info in a different way using libpci.a -- Look at the source of lspci
to see what you can do.
(In brief:
        struct pci_access *pacc;
        struct pci_dev *dev;
	pacc = pci_alloc();
        pci_init(pacc);
        pci_scan_bus(pacc);
        for (dev = pacc->devices; dev; dev = dev->next)
        {
                if (dev->vendor_id == PCI_VENDOR_ID_AAA &&
                    dev->device_id == PCI_DEVICE_ID_AAA_BBB)
                    break;
        }
        if (dev == NULL){
                fprintf(stderr, "No AAA BBB device\n");
		exit(1);
	}
        
        pciconf = xmalloc(sizeof *pciconf);
        pciconf->pciconfig.accesstype = PCI_CONFIG;
        pciconf->pciconfig.devp = dev;
        pci_fill_info(dev, PCI_FILL_IDENT | PCI_FILL_BASES | PCI_FILL_IRQ); 
        /*
         * Get the first 64-bytes of config space
         */
        pci_read_block(dev, 0, config, 64);
)
