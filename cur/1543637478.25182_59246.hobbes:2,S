No problem. Send me a patch that does it for both the EVIOSGABS and
EVIOCSABS and I'll take it. You can either just do it in evdev.c, or
change every driver to use the struct.

You can make it current, minimum, and maximum, if you wish.  I'm a
minimalist when it comes to naming, and I don't really think "_value" is
bringing much information here. All of them are values after all.
