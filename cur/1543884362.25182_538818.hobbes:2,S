argh.  the whole point of this discussion is to come to a *consensus*
on what should be in that feature removal file.  there is no point in
creating and submitting patches, either to update that file or remove
kernel features, until enough people *agree*.
at the risk of being head-bangingly repetitive, that's what the wiki
page is for:
http://fsdev.net/wiki/index.php?title=Stuff_to_be_removed
go.  read.  comment.  update.  add.  remove.  it's a wiki.  don't make
me pull this car over and explain it.  :-)
