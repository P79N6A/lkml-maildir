 I found the number of simultaneous connections under SPECWeb99 *
to be improved by ~1% when using Mala's SKB patch.
   2.5.25 baseline = 2656 simultaneous connections
2.5.25 + SKB patch = 2688 simultaneous connections
*  SPEC(tm) and the benchmark name SPECweb(tm) are registered
trademarks of the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation.
This benchmarking was performed for research purposes only,
and is non-compliant, with the following deviations from the
rules -
  1 - It was run on hardware that does not meed the SPEC
      availability-to-the-public criteria.  The machine is
      an engineering sample.
  2 - access_log wasn't kept for full accounting.  It was
      being written, but deleted every 200 seconds.
