SPF records would need to be on vger.kernel.org not on kernel.org. And
yes, this is the wrong place to ask. The right place would be
postmaster@vger.kernel.org. But I wouldn't bother -- it's manned by
people who have at least a modicum of clue, so I assume they won't do
anything as stupid as publishing SPF records. SPF is a fundamentally
broken mechanism which breaks valid email. It should not be encouraged
even by publishing no-op records ending in '?all'.
