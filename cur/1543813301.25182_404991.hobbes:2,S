It does call into question the "OMFG, there are 1000 bugs in the kernel"
hysteria that has found its way through various news forums.
The genuine bugs it does find are gold dust though.  There's a bunch
of stuff that's sat there for an eternity. It's just painstaking to
grovel through the reports weeding out the false positives.
A lot of the 'bugs' it's found are also not really going to make
the world stop turning soon. It even picked up a few cases of
code doing like.
void foo()
{
	int x;
	while (read status from hardware reg != READY)
		x++;
}
as uninitialised. Which is true, but as there's nothing
dependant on it, it's harmless.
