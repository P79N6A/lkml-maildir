What should I ask myself before I commit something to the branch which 
Stephen pulls into -next?
     Is this ready to be pulled by Linus right now if he had a merge
     window open today?
or
     Is it likely that I will let Linus pull this when he opens his next
     merge window?  (Assuming I can roughly predict when this will be,
     and what other work will likely be done until then, e.g. pending
     reviewer feedback, or patches for related functionality which should
     be bundled with the work in question...)
