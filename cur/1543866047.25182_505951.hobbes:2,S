To how many "sessions" those 1000 *parallel* I/O operations refer to? 
Because, if you batch them in an async fashion, they have to be parallel.
Without the per-async operation status code, you'll need to wait a result 
*for each* submitted syscall, even the ones that completed syncronously.
Open questions are:
- Is the 1000 *parallel* syscall vectored submission case common?
- Is it more expensive to forcibly have to wait and fetch a result even 
  for in-cache syscalls, or it's faster to walk the submission array?
