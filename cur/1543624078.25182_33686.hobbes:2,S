Martin, I wrote a patch in order to have a kswap daemon per node. Each
daemon swaps pages out only from its node. It might be of some interest
for your scalability problem, so let me know if you're interested in it (I
can't paste it here because it has also some other stuffs in it, and I
have to split the patch in several parts. I also need to port it to -rmap).
Cheers,
Samuel.
