Yep. This is a server side bug. I just checked the dump, and the client
is indeed sending the correct filehandle (exactly the same one as in the
COMMIT just before it).
Hmm... It looks to me as if you are exporting that filesystem with the
"subtree_check" option enabled. Could you try to set "no_subtree_check"?
The subtree checking stuff breaks NFS in various subtle ways (including
renames etc), and is one of the more common sources of ESTALE errors.
