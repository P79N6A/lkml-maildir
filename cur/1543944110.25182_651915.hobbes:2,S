Dunno, but I don't think so. Epoll initializes the node to a state so that 
later on can check if the file-fd item is inserted or not. And it uses the 
"parent" information for that. But rb_set_parent() (that is used in the 
current initialization code) uses the data in the node, and this triggers 
the uninitialized memory access.
Taking a better look at it, the code (after the latest changes) has no 
more point-of-failures after the rb-tree insert, so I can probably avoid 
doing the node's parent-initialization and check altogether.
Yeah, let's that ;)

Andrew, drop that one. I'm gonna send the new one after some test...
