The compiler should be now fixed in this respect, for both my stuff that's in
the kernel and Andrea's desired replacement. The problem appears to have been
triggered by having two "input+output" constraints (eg: "+r", "+m"). However,
I can't test this because the head of the CVS trunk doesn't seem to have been
able to build and test successfully since just before the fix was
applied. (I'm going on the codesourcery builds for this).
