I can confirm this bug for kernel 2.6.3-rc4 as well, so it's not too recent.
I found the following on my console after quitting k3b ungracefully, maybe
it's useful for narrowing down the problem:
Message from syslogd@gandalf at Tue Apr 27 22:45:53 2004 ...
gandalf kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occu
rred on CPU 0.
