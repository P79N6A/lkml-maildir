 With an i386 system such a pair of INTA cycles would be generated by the 
CPU itself and translated by the north bridge to a PCI Interrupt 
Acknowledge cycle (see the PCI spec for a more elaborate description).
 If the CPU does not generate INTA cycles, it is a common practice to let 
it ask the north bridge for a PCI Interrupt Acknowledge in some other way, 
typically by issuing a read cycle that returns the vector reported by the 
interrupt controller.

 Huh?  Have you managed to find an 8259A clone *that* broken?  So what 
does it return if you write 0xc to the address 0x20 in the I/O port space 
and then read back from that location?  You should complain to the 
manufacturer -- they may be able to fix the problem in a later revision.
 BTW, I have just found a bug (OK, a misfeature, perhaps) in 
include/asm-mips/i8259.h. ;-)  I'll cook a patch.

 More or less -- 3-5 should probably be the outcome of a single read 
transaction from the north bridge.  I.e. you issue a read to a "magic" 
location, 3-5 happen, and the data value returned is the vector presented 
by the interrupt controller on the PCI bus.

 You can still dispatch interrupts manually by examining the IRR register, 
but having a way to ask the 8259A's prioritiser would be nice.  Although 
given such a lethal erratum you report I would not count on the 
prioritiser to provide any useful flexibility...
