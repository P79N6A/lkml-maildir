I'll deal with it when a bug report comes in.
  1.) The ieee1394 subsystem is known to work on x86_64 with more than 4
GB RAM, so I gather that architecture code already sets a proper DMA
mask for all those 32bit PCI OHCI-1394 implementations out there.
  2.) I haven't heard of an OHCI-1394 chip whose overall DMA range was
bigger than the Physical Range.  There are only two chips, from ALi and
from Fujitsu, whose Physical Range is curiously bigger than the actual
DMA range.
