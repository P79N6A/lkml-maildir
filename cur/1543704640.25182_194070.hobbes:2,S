I'm not totally sure I agree that the kernel should save this
information. With all the things the kernel does save, keyboard might be
a good thing. Consider someone with a REALLY hacked layout, like
modified dvorak or some of the keyboards for the access challenged. Now
think "can't use the keyboard enough to type in the ...ing commands to
do the load."
If we can carry the code for two competing disfunctional ACPI
implementations and a used-to-work but we broke it for some machines
APM, we can surely add a pair om memcpy lines to eliminate at least one
"oh-shit moment."
Obviously my opinion only, some breakage due to BIOS misfeatures,
contents may settle in shipping, etc.
