static inline void pci_unmap_single(struct pci_dev *hwdev, dma_addr_t

Please try to store both the dma address and the virtual address in your
driver and use pci_map_single().
I'm aware of one case where that's not possible: if your hardware builds
a linked list of finished commands, and that list is in DMA addresses,
not virtual addresses.
I think both sym53c8xx and one of the USB controllers (usb-ohci.c?) have
that problem, they use a hash table for the reverse dma address->linear
address mapping.
I hope that answers your question.
