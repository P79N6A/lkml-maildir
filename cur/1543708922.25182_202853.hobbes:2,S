I've posted something like this before. It seems the load calculator
takes the io_wait "cpu usage" (which isn't really a cpu usage, it just
categorizes processes waiting in io_schedule here instead of the idle
time) into account. While doing heavy disk I/O my webserver showed a
load of over 40 but the cpu was idle. I don't like this either.
