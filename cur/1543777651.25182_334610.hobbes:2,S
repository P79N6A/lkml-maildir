The problem is simple and I have it since 2.6.12 final (tested on 2.6.12, 
2.6.12.2, 2.6.13-rc3). After grub stage2 (kernel image loaded) the system 
freeze and I can only hit the three-finger-salute (ctrl+alt+del).
The system is:
Asus A8V Deluxe bios 1014.007 (tested with 1014.001 and 1013)
AMD Athlon 64 3800+ running in 32bit mode
2 GB of DDR PC3200
nVIDIA GF FX 5600XT 256Mb
3 HD (1 ATA and 2 SATA)
etc etc
and it's running mail, web, ldap, ftp and NX services
Here's some info:

Yes, I'm running 2.6.12, in fact, after hours of recompilations I was able to 
generate a running kernel (based on 2.6.12.2)...
Every 2.6.11 works fine, this is the only one working 2.6.12 and I don't know 
why it works...
Unfortunately, I can't give any more information since the error appears in an 
early stage... :(
