Alan,
I'm impressed!!!  You do understand NetWare architecture very well. 
Some corrections though.

There is a checksum field in IPX, but it always contains xFFFF.  Drew
always assumed upper layer programs, like NDS, would do heir own
checksumming for integrity, and in fact, this is how it's instrumented
in NetWare.

IPX does do fragmentation, it's just that Linux's doesn't.  The
fragmentation is handled at the ECB layer and the drivers never see it. 
IPX headers and responses, in fact, the entire **REAL** IPX interface is
completely built around this concept internal to NetWare, and everything
is treated like a fragment list.

No it is not.  This is where you guys got it wrong.  Packet Burst is an
**NCP** is does not reside in IPX at all.  That's why the implementation
in Linux is busted.  The window size is variable and keys off of HOW
MANY FREE ECBS ARE IN THE SYSTEM.  It doe not belong in the IPX/SPX
stack, but inside of MARS-NWE proper.
About that time it also

Correct.  This is why it's so damn fast.

576 bytes.  Drew came up with this because he did not want to fuck
around with handling cases of re-assembly of packets that would cross
routers of different frame size.  Oddly enough, it's fastr to use
smaller packets ith IPX that larger (though this woud seem
counterintutive).

Good idea.
