Capabilities are a broken model for privilege management; try RBAC/TE
instead.  
http://www.securecomputing.com/pdf/secureos.pdf
 has notes
about the history and comparison of capabilities vs. TE.
Instead of adding new capability bits, replace capable() calls with LSM
hook calls that offer you finer granularity both in operation and in
object-based decisions, and then use a security module like SELinux to
map that to actual permission checks.  SELinux provides a framework for
defining security classes and permissions, including both definitions
used by the kernel and definitions used by userspace policy enforcers
(ala security-enhanced X).
