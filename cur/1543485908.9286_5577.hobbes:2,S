It's at 
http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~keryan/slram/
 
and patches cleanly against 2.0.36 and 2.1.129. You can apply the rejects
from the 2.1.129 patch by hand to 2.2.1, or try my *alpha* 2.2.1 version,
which has a couple of new features (notably module support), but the docs
need updating, and it's rather untested right now. Feedback about whether
any of the changes made in the *alpha* version are useful, etc. would be
appreciated (multiple /dev/slram support turned out less useful than I had
hoped). 
Also, any patch collection pages that should have a link to this? I know
Rik van Riel's page has it...
