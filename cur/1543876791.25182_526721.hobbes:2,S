Hi Dave,
I'm not sure if I follow.  How do I use mknod with no console to use it
from?  Can this be done in the init scripts or from u-boot?  Still
learning so any help would be appreciated.
I was able to trace the console opening to __dentry_open() in fs/open.c
It does open(inode, f) but returns error -6 if this is any help.  I will
try to trace it further to see what is wrong.
Thanks,
Tom
