Well, I've found an entry in /proc that has some information.  The entry is:
/proc/net/softnet_stat
The first two columns are:
total
dropped
In this case, dropped is the number of messages dropped due to the softnet_data
queue being full.  I have actually hit this under high load.
I'm still looking for socket/protocol specific stuff though.
