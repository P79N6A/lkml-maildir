Agreed.  I'll mention it on the gcc list.  The compiler could always get
better, but we always give it a helping hand, don't we?  Particularly
with manual CSE - it's everywhere.
Regarding "mess up the source": beg to differ.  The use of 'const'
actually improves the source.  A lot.  Contracts, communication of
designer intent, etc.  Religious issue - I stop here.
[ It doesn't mess up the source as much as 'asm', and why do we use that
in places where C would work? :) ]
