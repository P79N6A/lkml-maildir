As you point out, this will require changes to several userspace
programs.  It is the correct long term solution, but a deprecation
period would be nice.

Using EDD to deduce the geometry is the "right" answer.  But this is
sufficiently complex and special-purpose that it has no place in the
kernel.

Values used by the controller itself.  Also the values you will get
from the "extended INT13" BIOS interface.  As good a geometry as any,
unless you plan to dual-boot Windows.

Fine idea in the long term, but start by declaring the HDIO_GETGEO
interface "obsolescent" and spit a warning to syslog when it is used.
Finding and fixing all the userspace invocations will take some time.
Right now, HDIO_GETGEO is the only way some applications (e.g., mine)
can convince Parted to use the right geometry.  So, fix Parted to
allow the user (i.e., the higher-level partitioning machinery) to
specify the geometry.  This is the first and last necessary task
before eliminating Parted's use of HDIO_GETGEO.

Why does this stupid idea keep coming up?  Inferring the geometry from
the existing partition table is just plain wrong.  It is even more
wrong than the old 2.4 behavior, because it is still a guess, just a
worse guess.
