Larry,
I visited:
http://www.bitkeeper.com/
clicked on products, then clicked on downloads & status, and then
clicked on the link to the free use license, which links to:
http://www.bitkeeper.com/Sales.Licensing.Free.html
Presumably this can be considered a typical way to navigate through
the site.
The license I was presented with was the BitKeeper License version
1.37, 02/18/02.  This does not include the clause about the license
being unavailable to people who are developing a competing product to
Bitkeeper.
I pointed this out to you in a private E-Mail, but I didn't receive a
response - I think it is very confusing for people to believe that
they are licensed to use the product, only to later be told that they
are not.
John.
