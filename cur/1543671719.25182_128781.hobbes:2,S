i dont believe it needs to be a variadic (the afs syscall will/uses the
first params).  however, the syscall interface for afs predates linux.
changing to a different interface just for linux kernels seems somewhat
costly (programmers time) when this existing interface has been well
tested and debugged on several other operating systems.
