Nope, you can have zero, one, or many names for a file.  One of them is
special in that the file header backlinks to it, but that's the only thing
the filesystem does to make one name any sort of standard.  I don't recall
whether INSTALL barks when handed a multilinked file, but it makes good
sense.

It means that the image(s) on that volume won't be privileged until the
sysadmin changes the Known Files List.  Read on.

Hmmm, I don't recall such a restriction.  There's no need:  known files
are held open, so you can't dismount the volume they're on.  Okay, you can
take the pack off without DISMOUNTing it, and screw on a new pack, but the
results won't be useful.
