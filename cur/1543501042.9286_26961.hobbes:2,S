	This is announcing the availability of device drivers for the
Computone Intelliport II family of multiport serial cards on the 2.2 and
2.3 series Linux kernels.
	There is also now a mailing list for the Computone drivers and
boards under linux.  Mailing list instructions are at the bottom of this
announcement.
What is supported:
	The Computone Intelliport II family of multiport serial cards on
ISA, PCI, and EISA busses.
	Up to four cards are supported in one system.  These cards can share
a single interrupt or use individual interrupts on a card by card basis.
	Cards can each support up to 4 expansion interface boxes.
	Expansion interface boxs can support up to 16 ports.
	That gives a capacity of up to 256 serial ports when all four boards
are installed and fully populated.
	Some of the boards and expansion interface modules support port
speeds of up to 921,600 Baud.
	For more hardware information, see the Computone web site:
		
http://www.computone.com
What is NOT supported:
	MCA bus at this time (Is there any demand?  See the mailing list.)
	Computone products prior to the Intelliport II line.  The earlier
ATvantage and Intelliport cards are not support.  These cards are very very
old and have firmware that can not be upgraded.  Sorry...
Versions:
	Computone has been suppling "BETA" drivers (1.0 series) for the 2.0
kernels from their ftp site for some time.  These drivers have now been
enhanced and have been updated to work with the latest kernels (1.2 series
drivers).  The current driver version as of this annoucement is 1.2.1.
	The 1.2.1 drivers are available in two forms.  From the Computone
ftp site, the drivers are available in their conventional *.dd format,
which is really a tar file which they intended to be "dd'ed" over to a
floppy.  Download the driver bundle from the Computone ftp site and
install per the instructions in the README.computone file.  It does
not extract into its own subdirectory and is intended to be extracted into
the [...]/linux/drivers/char directory.
	The Computone drivers for Linux are available on their ftp site at:
	
ftp://ftp.computone.com/PUB/Products/IntelliPortII/Linux/BETA
	The 1.2.1 drivers are also available in a patch file against the
2.2.10 kernel source tree.  This patch has been tested against and will
patch 2.2.10ac4 and 2.3.8.  It will, most likely, patch any of the 2.2 and
2.3 kernels prior to those.  This patch file will NOT patch the 2.0 kernels.
	The 1.2.1 Computone drivers in kernel patch form is availble from:
	
http://www.wittsend.com/computone/linux-2.2.10-ctone.patch.gz
	Earlier drivers are NOT available in this form.
	The 1.2.1 drivers will install into the 2.0 kernels, but you must
use the patch bundle from the Computone ftp site and follow the instructions
in the README.computone file.  You can use either method for 2.2 and 2.3
kernels, depending on your preferences.
	The 1.2.1 drivers have been submitted to Alan Cox and we are wrorking
to have them appear in the kernel source tree eventually.
Mailing List Instructions:	linux-computone
	Submissions:	linux-computone@lazuli.wittsend.com
	The linux-computone list is managed by majordomo.  To subscribe,
please sent an e-mail to "majordomo@lazuli.wittsend.com" with the following
in the body:
	subscribe linux-computone [optional e-mail address]
	Subscription to linux-computone is "open+confirm".  That means that
you must "confirm" your subscription before it becomes effective.  Majordomo
will send two messages to you.  One is a status message which goes back
to the sender of the request.  One is a confirmation request which will go
back to the address to be subscribed (which may be different if you specified
an e-mail address on the subscribe command).  That second message will contain
instructions and a majordomo command line.  Follow the instructions!  Send a
new message back to majordomo@lazuli.wittsend.com with the single command line
in the body of the message.  Simply replying to the confirmation request
will not work.
	This open, unmoderated, mailing list is for discussion of the
Computone products and device drivers on the Linux Operating system.
This includes boards and drivers for the Intelliport II family of multiport
serial cards but may also include things like the Computone Intelliserver
or other standalone products which may be accessed or supported by the
Linux operating system.
