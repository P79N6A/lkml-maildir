that's what I was initially wondering about, but it looks like only linear
data is copied. Will that cause too much a overhead ? (I don't like copying
at all anyway, but if it can help us find the cause, I'll happily test it).
BTW, Jarek, don't be sorry, I *am* expecting to crash my laptop a number of
times before ensuring the bug is fixed. I just don't want to lose my data.
Cheers,
