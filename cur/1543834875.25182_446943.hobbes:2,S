Relax, align is nearly never set.
- kmalloc uses align==0, except if the architecture requests it 
(ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN not 0)
- on my i386 system, the following users explicitely use align:
* the pmd structure (4096: hardware requirement)
* the pgd structure (32 bytes: hardware requirement)
* the task structure (16 byte. fxsave)
* sigqueue, pid: both request 4 byte alignment (based on __alignof__()). 
Doesn't affect debugging.

The kmalloc caches are allocated with 
HWCACHE_ALIGN+ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN. The logic in kmem_cache_create 
didn't handle that case correctly.
On most architectures, ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is 0. Thus SLAB_DEBUG 
redzones everything.
On s390, ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is 8. This disables redzoning.
Ok?
