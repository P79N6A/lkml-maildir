my goodness; it's been so long since l-k saw this traditional sport!
nothing much has changed in the intrim: SCSI still costs 2-3x as much,
and still offers the same, ever-more-niche set of advantages 
(decent hotswap, somewhat higher reliability, moderately higher performance,
easier expansion to more disks and/or other devices.)

besides having missed the last 2-3 generations of ATA (which include
things like diskconnect), you have clearly not noticed that entry-level
hardware with PoS UDMA100 controllers can sustain more bandwidth than
you can hope to consume (120 MB/s is pretty easy, even on 32x33 PCI!)

yeah, if Sun can't make IDE scream, then no one can eh?
