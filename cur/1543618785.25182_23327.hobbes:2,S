Yes, that I would.  Why is it so "pointless if it's nonportable?"  Under 
that argument Linux should never be able to do anything that any other 
OS hasn't already done.  What it does it it makes it very easy to 
replace a file-based convention -- say, purely as an example, 
~/.signature -- with a process-based one.  A FIFO won't do, since it 
only contains one data stream and therefore can become corrupt if opened 
by more than one process.
There should be no reason to limit the utility of common operations. 
open() is one of the fundamental operations -- you can open *anything* 
in the namespace, except, for no good reason, Unix domain sockets.
