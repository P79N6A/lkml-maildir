Depends. /dev/cpu/x/cpuid is preferred over cpuinfo, as it remains
constant across kernel versions.

We don't do any change to /proc/cpuinfo in this case. As I mentioned
in an earlier mail, the only way you could disable prefetch in this way
would be by reporting the entire sse/3dnow instruction sets as unavailable
which is overkill.
With Andi's fix, userspace programs doing prefetch get fixed up
transparently, making this a non-issue.
