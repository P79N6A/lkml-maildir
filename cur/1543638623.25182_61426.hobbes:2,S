I would expect that from scientific apps, which often go through their
dataset in a fairy regular pattern. If sequential, then page coloring
is at its best, because your cache can become the limiting factor, if
you can't squeeze data into the cache due to false sharing in the same
cache class.
The way I see page coloring is that any hard work done in virtual space
(either by compiler or by app writer [ latter holds for numerical apps ])
to be cache friendly, is not circumvented by a <stupid> physical page 
assignment by the OS that leads to less than complete cache utilization.
That's why the cache index bits from the address are carried over or
are kept the same in virtual and physical address. That's the purpose of
page coloring.....
This regular access pattern is not necessarily true in apps like JVM or other 
object oriented code where data accesses can be less predictive. There page 
coloring might not help you at all.
