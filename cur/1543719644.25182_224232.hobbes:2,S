Probably CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is notrelated...

I bet it is faulty RAM (hardware bug). To be sure run memtest 
http://memtest.org/
 for a few hours if possible
Try running with 1GB, but with the new DIMM (t.e. just exchange the DIMMs).
If this works, put now the old DIMM back, but on different DIMM slot and try memtest.
Report back.
