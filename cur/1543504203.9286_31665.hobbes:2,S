It doesn't have to match the main CPU. There are some algorithms that
are lightning fast on DSP's and creep like snails even on the K7. Audio
FX processing comes to mind, mp3 (de)compression, too. You don't want to
use a DSP for word processing, you want to use it for those special
tasks where it blows away any {R,C}ISC processor by several orders of
magnitude*. Also you have the added bonus of parallel processing.
On the subject of innovation cycles, I'd like to simply say: Look what
mainstream's done to graphic accelerators.

* c't magazine project: MP3 decoder. Uses DSP (10MHz, iirc). You want to
tell me that a 10Mhz K7 can do this?
