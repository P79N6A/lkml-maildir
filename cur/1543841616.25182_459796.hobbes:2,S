Agreed. I used to run fsx on regular basis - never saw the problem
before. I will try to go back few kernel versions and verify.

Here is the other fix, I did to avoid the problem (basically, have
jbd manage its own submit function and skip unmapped buffers) - not
elegant. Thats why I tried to address at the root cause..
Thanks,
Badari
Patch to fix: Kernel BUG at fs/buffer.c:2791
on 1k (2k) filesystems while running fsx.
journal_commit_transaction collects lots of dirty buffer from
and does a single ll_rw_block() to write them out. ll_rw_block()
locks the buffer and checks to see if they are dirty and submits
them for IO.
In the mean while, journal_unmap_buffers() as part of
truncate can unmap the buffer and throw it away. Since its
a 1k (2k) filesystem - each page (4k) will have more than
one buffer_head attached to the page and and we can't free 
up buffer_heads attached to the page (if we are not
invalidating the whole page).
Now, any call to set_page_dirty() (like msync_interval)
could end up setting all the buffer heads attached to
this page again dirty, including the ones those got
cleaned up :(
So, -not-so-elegant fix would be to have make jbd skip all 
the buffers that are not mapped.
