Subject: saving & follow-up analyzing (by the bootloader) the  kernel boo t log buffer on "vanilla"Linux (2.6)  usable for all architecture platfor ms

Could such examination be made available (as a debug option)
in the simple bootloader's load_kernel(),
before "unzipping" kernel ?
I presume that the code for outputting log buffer,
currently executed during the kernel booting (after console_init()),
could be placed in the library
and thus be available for simple boot loader ?
That would require adding some sort of testable bit pattern
being stored at the header and tail of the log_buf,
so it could be checked for corruption upon reading 
(may be checksum too ?)
Who among Linux kernel maintainers would be interested in doing so ?

I suppose so long as the firmware doesn't erase or otherwise overwrite
things, you should be able to find log_buf by looking at System.map and
subtracing 0xc0000000.
