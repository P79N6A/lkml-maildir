As far as I can see, glibc internally looks at /proc/mounts (or else mtab) to
find out where tmpfs is mounted for opening files there, and to look up
filesystem information for statfs(), while accessing that path, too. Fstatfs()
also looks into the same files, but it only matches by filesystem type, so this
is only a very unreliable heuristic, anyway.
So judging from that, glibc users should be fine.

I agree with the separation of discussion argument. Here are patches that
change getcwd() and /proc/mounts independent of the changes that AppArmor
depends on.
Thanks for your feedback!
