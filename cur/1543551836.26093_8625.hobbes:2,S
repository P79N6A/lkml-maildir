I've begun to test 2.4.0 kernels on some high traffic machines to see
what kind of difference it makes. I have seen a lot of these error
messages in dmesg and although they don't seem to happen very often and
seem harmless, I figured I'd report it anyway. They show up in groups
(mostly) from the same IP and only in very small numbers (3-15).
IPs have been changed to protect the innocent:
TCP: peer x.x.x.x:1268/7777 shrinks window 2604660027:635:2604661487.
Bad, what else can I say?
