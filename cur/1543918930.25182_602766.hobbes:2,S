Obviously true, but that's not a reason to bar enhancements to the VGA 
console. Right now, there's no sane way to have a splash screen in userspace 
handle an oops, so people looking to reproduce and detect the root of a 
problem will inevitably fall back to VGA (or vesa, presumably), where colour 
might be useful.
I recall seeing a distro kernel oops early in boot, where the palette had been 
corrupted by the splash so the oops wasn't readable. That's bad, right?
Don't get me wrong, I don't care for the feature much, I just don't 
think "splash screens are defacto" is a reason to shy away from a feature 
that could be useful for novices reporting kernel bugs. These people are 
probably inbetween those that must have a shiny splash and those that fix the 
kernel bugs.
Of course, what Alan said elsewhere about breaking things that work is a good 
reason to not add the feature, or at least make it only happen on a real 
display.
