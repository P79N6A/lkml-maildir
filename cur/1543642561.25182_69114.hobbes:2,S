As this is an IDE device I'm not sure what hdc=scsi should do...
However that seems to get rid of the oops.  It appears to operate
normally (I can mount CD's, DVD's, play DVD's, and play CD's).
cdparanoia even works (with no sg module installed -- which I thought it
needed) though while it's running the CPU usage jumps to 100%.  :(
I see that the Configure.help now says to use "hdx=scsi".  I am not sure
where I received the information to use "hdx=ide-scsi" but that did work
with kernel 2.4.18.
Cheers,
