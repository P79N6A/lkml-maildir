I haven't seen tutorials for epoll or aio.  Have you already
looked at these?
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/nio-improve.html
http://lse.sourceforge.net/epoll/index.html
http://epoll.hackerdojo.com/
or at some aio testing code:
http://developer.osdl.org/daniel/AIO/
http://developer.osdl.org/daniel/AIO/TESTS/
Chris Mason (SuSE/Novell) also has an aio stress tester iirc.
Try searching for it.
Bill Irwin (wli) did an aio/epoll presentation at OLS 2004.
I don't know where to find it, though.
