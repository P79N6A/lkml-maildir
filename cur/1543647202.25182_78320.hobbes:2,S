No.  Sorry.
This is an accupoint II, with specs only available via a NDA :((
I will be very happy to get them, because this one have 4 buttons,
and 2 of them are 'programable' (as claimed by toshiba),
but I don't know how.

Ok.  Agreed.
I think also that this perticuliar problem occur _only_
with the toshiba satellite 3000-100 and 3000-400 (as reported by FBSD users),
so I guess I have to send a patch for a dmi_scan.c workaround.
