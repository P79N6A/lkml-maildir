I know it's fri^Wsatursday but it does not help if you do not specify which
patch you applied.
At a minimum, you want to upgrade the sources of the r8169 driver up to a
more recent 2.4.x: simply drop a drivers/net/r8169.c from the latest 2.4.x
into your 2.4.24 tree, rebuild and report the result (+ complete dmesg +
lspci -vx + lsmod for my collection please).
