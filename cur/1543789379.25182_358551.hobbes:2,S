I *had*, when this hit me :) It was one those spurt things. I am going to
look at this, but I think we will need to do this with some careful
benchmarking.
At the moment however I do have another concern - open/close taking too
much time as I mentioned in an earlier email. It is nearly 4 times
slower than 2.6.13. So, that is first up in my list of things to
do at the moment.
Thanks
