  Have you ever seen reply-chains resulting at such schemes ?
    Re: [FOO] Re: [FOO] Re: [FOO] Re: [FOO] subject text
  If you want to pre-filter messages traveling thru  linux-kernel  list,
  all you need to do is to check the content of   Return-Path:  header.
  Or perhaps my utter aborrence is due to the way how GNU MAILMAN handles
  that tagging (badly, that is).
