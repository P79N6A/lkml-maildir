It's the same bug for file pages as we had for anonymous pages, which
the POWER guys actually hit. Do you disagree? I like this patch much
better than the smp_wmb that we currently do just for anon pages.

I think the memorder problem is conceptually a page data vs PG_uptodate
one, because the read-side assumes that the data will be initialised before
PG_uptodate is set.
After the page is uptodate, you don't need subsequent barriers (that you
would get via flush_dcache_page), because we've never really tried to
impose any synchronisation on parallel read vs write.
A memory barrier in flush_dcache_page would do the trick as well, I think,
but it is not really any better. It is misleading because it is not the
canonical fix. And we'd still need the smp_rmb in the PageUptodate read-side.

I guess so. I guess that the __ variants *can* only be used on new pages
anyway. I wanted to make it clear that it wasn't a non-atomic version of
exactly the same operation, but __SetPageUptodate probably would be fine.

Newly initialised pages, before they become visible to anyone else. We
could put a BUG_ON(page_count(page) != 1); in there?
