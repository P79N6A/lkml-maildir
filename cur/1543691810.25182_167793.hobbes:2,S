Subject: [PATCH] autofs4 deadlock during expire - kernel 2.6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have noticed that a deadlock can occur in the autofs4 module in the 2.6 
kernel and RedHat kernels with the O(1) scheduler patch. The easiest way 
to reproduce it is with an autofs-4.0.0 tree mount with at least 10 mounts 
within a Nautilus desktop environment with the module debug flag set. 
Perhaps this is because of the longish amount of time spent in the expire 
state.
The scenario:
1) An expire locates an expirable dentry and signals the user space 
daemon to umount it.
2) During the umount operation Nautilus notices and scans entries in the 
directory tree triggering a revalidate/lookup.
3) autofs4 places the requesting process on the umount wait queue. 
4) At completion of the expire both process are released from the wait 
queue.
5) If the lookup gets a quantum first deadlock occurs and expiration stops 
leaving an autofs mount that is permanently busy.
The following patch fixes this by ensuring that the expire gets a lookin 
before the revalidate/lookup continues.
The problem of the remount that this causes remains and I an not sure how 
to deal with that at this stage.
Comments and suggestions please.
Is this acceptable for inclusion in the kernel?
If so what should I do to make this happen?
