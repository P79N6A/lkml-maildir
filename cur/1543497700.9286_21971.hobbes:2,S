Maybe I'm just being stupid, but is there some constraint that
prevents
a CDROM boot image from being large (larger than a floppy image that
is).
I would tend to think not, unless their is some BIOS limit - and maybe
this
can be worked around. If so, adding all the PCMCIA stuff to a CDROM
boot
image shouldn't be difficult.
