OGAWA, honestly I only tried testcase 2.
But looking at your suggestion its not clear to me whether
there is a bug.
Remember we need to determine a valid interval [ last_pid .. next_safe ).
In the pid_map function, if no pid is available, then
[ PID_MAX .. PID_MAX ) will be returned.
The other path should also end up with this as well.
Could you  point where you see this not happening.
In the next release, I'll look at using your bitmap function suggestion.
