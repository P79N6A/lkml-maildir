Except that it does.  Go read it, then come back and admit you were
mistaken and spreading lies about it.
The vendor must decide between respecting the freedom of the user, or
stopping itself from modifying the software too.

What it does is to seek to carry out its mission (*) of defending
users' freedoms.  Obstacles that are placed to impede the user from
enjoying the freedoms are supposed to not be permitted by the GPL.
(*) it seems that understanding "spirit of a license" is very
difficult for you; does the term "mission" help you understand what
the GPL means when it says "similar in spirit"?

Sorry, wrong.  Barring nonsense.

FTR, rent model wasn't me, and it doesn't escape the GPLv3dd4
obligations IIUC, IANAL.

You misunderstand not only the spirit of the license, but his
intentions.  Oh, wait!  They're the same, that's why.
Respect and defend users' freedoms.
Repeat after me until it sinks.
I know you're not stupid.  Why do you pretend to be?
