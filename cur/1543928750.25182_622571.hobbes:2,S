This is rather ambiguous, while most people know what you mean,
clarifying it a bit might be nice. How about something like,
Unaligned memory accesses occur when trying to read more than a byte
(i.e. u16, u32, u64) in a single instruction from an address that is not
evenly divisible by the width of the type (i.e. addr % width != 0).
For example, if you had 4GB of virtual memory, picture it as an
array of bytes,
	u8 memory[4096 * (1024 * 1024)];	/* 4G bytes */
Aligned accesses would be accessing this array in this manner,
	u16 memory[(4096 * (1024 * 1024)) / sizeof(u16)] /* 2G bytes */
	u32 memory[(4096 * (1024 * 1024)) / sizeof(u32)] /* 1G bytes */
	u64 memory[(4096 * (1024 * 1024)) / sizeof(u64)] /* 512M bytes */
And an unaligned access would be accessing on a non-integer multiple
boundary.
Ok, that kind of sucked too. But you get the idea.

The rest of this looks good.
