In principle, yes. However, there are a couple of versions of the
SA1100, and not all of them support all clock speeds. And you can
also safely overclock the CPU (from 221 to 236 or 250 MHz), although
that's undefined behaviour according to the data sheets. That's why
the driver currently is a module: easy configuration at insmod time.

OK, then doing the maths sounds sane enough.
