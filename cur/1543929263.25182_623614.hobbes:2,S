Yes I just temporarily switched from Fedora to Slax for a medium sized project I am working on.  I wanted to stick with Fedora, but the requirements are forcing me to use Slax.
I assumed the problem was with the kernel since install.sh came with the kernel.org kernel.  Now this may be a silly question, but why is the install script distro specific?  I assumed that the install script would be modular like the kernel.  If a new bootloader came out, just add a module.  Please keep in mind I have no knowledge of the kernel internals.  I just compile and go.
Thanks,
Scott
