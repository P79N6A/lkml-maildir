Compilation is compute-intensive, not fork-intensive.  Think shell

The vector at the head of the list is half full on average.  All the
other vectors in the chain are 100% full.  For the single-pte nodes,
Bill reported "the mean pte_chain length for chains of length > 1 is
around 6, and the std. dev. is around 12, and the distribution is *very*
long-tailed".   This is a good fit.

page->pte?
It may be a net loss for high sharing levels.  Dunno.
