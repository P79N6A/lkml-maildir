Hi,
thanks for the suggestion, but I'm actually sold on using eepro100 and
3c59x NICs, both flavours never gave me any trouble (yes, I know about
the 3xc59x and I was always careful to choose either the "B" with 2.0
and early 2.2 and now the "C" with later 2.2. Call me a snob for going
the "FreeBSD way" and choosing HW that works and not taking the
challenge to bring even the most obscure HW lying in a bin at a
customer to work but telling the customer "you can now buy a new,
guaranteed flawlessly performing NIC for $25 or pay me for four hours
trying to get _that_ NIC to work. I charge a little more than $25 per
hour..". Got them every time. ;-)
Basically I burned [1] all my tulip NICs around a long time ago.

Hm. If I really need more NICs than PCI slots, I normally use a
Router. And I've even toyed a little with a Gigabit card linked to a
Cisco C3524XL using a certain 802.1q unofficial extension to the Linux
kernel to try and provide 24 100 MBit Ethernet Interfaces from a
single Linux Box [2].

[1] Put them in the unavoidable Windows NT and 2000 boxes where most of them
    with "vendor supported, MHL approved, certified and signed drivers" 
    crash and burn as happily as under Linux. But the it is the fault of 
    "the other consultant". I don't do Windows. 
[2] Didn't work, though. Got a C7206 instead. O:-)
