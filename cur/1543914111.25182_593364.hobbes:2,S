Hi again,
with the r8169 I can't send a magic packet anymore. I'm using ethtool
for that, with the previous one (an rtl8139b) it was working very well.
ethtool -D apparently says it could send the packet ok.
The receiving side hasn't changed (it's an r8169 too), it's setup for
wake-on-lan and is soft-powered-off with ACPI as it should (no change in
config since a few years).
Do I have to set something special on the sending end ?
Thanks,
	Xav
