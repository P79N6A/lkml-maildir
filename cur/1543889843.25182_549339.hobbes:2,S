sure enough, i'll work something sane out - i already have it partly 
split up. It will probably be something along the lines of: 'remove 
stuff that we can remove and still have functional scheduling' followed 
by an 'add minimal CFS patch' and then nicely split up 'CFS related 
add-ons' (like the task-stats accounting things, debugging, etc). Do you 
think i should try to split up the core CFS bits some more beyond this 
level? (that would be quite nontrivial i suspect)
