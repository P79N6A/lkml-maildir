Well if I understand it correctly, compressed caching, umm, compresses
the cache ;)
And dbench writes 01 01 01 01 01 everywhere.  Enormously compressible.
So it's basically fitting vastly more pagecache into the machine.
That would be my guessing, anyway.  Changing dbench to write random
stuff might change the picture.
