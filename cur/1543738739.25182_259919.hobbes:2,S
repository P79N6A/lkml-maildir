This is not a law of nature. You can mount sync as well. That, of course,
sucks in terms of performance and wear. A reasonable compromise
would be to do sync on close.
Supermount did this years ago.

You cannot. That's giving mlock() to everybody.

Devices break. You have to cope with devices going away suddenly.
You are not required to ensure data integrity in all cases, but the system
must not suffer. To allow that you must be able to get rid of the mounts
even if users do not cooperate.
