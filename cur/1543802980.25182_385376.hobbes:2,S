Heh, I only found out about it when some Ubuntu user mentioned it in an
ALSA bug report.  I guess they just expect people to find them somehow.
So yes, there needs to be a single, central resource for OSS bounties.
I think a lot of these problems with the PPC drivers were later solved.
But my point was really that $500 was not nearly enough for the amount
of work that would have been required.  It's a nice bonus for someone
who would have done it for free anyway but I was under the impression
that bounties were created to solve problems too tricky or unrewarding
or uninteresting for someone to do for free.
