Hi,
I've got serious problems connecting to www.itu.int with Kernels > 2.6.15.
2.6.17.X seems to be especially bad and I also tested it with the
latest 2.6.17.8 (no change).
Receiving data is extremely slow, close to non-existing.
This was first observed with Squid, but is confirmed by using the
netcat utility:
#> echo -e "GET /home/index.html HTTP/1.0\n\n" | nc www.itu.int 80
Disabling ECN doesn't help.
tcp_congestion_control was set to bic and hybla - no change, too.
This issue further has been confirmed on 2 seperate servers connected
via 2 independent ISPs.
Does anyone have a clue?
Please include me on CC: as I'm not subscribed.
Kind regards,
M.
