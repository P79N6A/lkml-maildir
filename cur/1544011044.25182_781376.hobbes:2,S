I agree that buffering metadata and references to COWable structures is 
useful, but this doesn't require a new allocator.

I'm not sure what you mean by checkpoint image read-ahead.  The data is 
in a stream format and not a randomly accessible packet format.

This is a bit off-topic for this patch series, but what are your intents 
on socket serialization?
FWIW looking at the socket problem for our purposes, we expect to throw 
away all network sockets (and internal state including queued rx/tx 
data) at checkpoint (replacing them with sockets that return ECONNRESET 
at restore time) and rely on userland exception handling to re-establish 
RPC channels.  This failure mode looks exactly the same as a network 
partition/machine restart/application crash which our applications need 
to handle already.

Right, nesting can be a problem, so maybe on stack isn't the best way to 
handle the header allocations, but again this doesn't necessarily mean 
we need a new object allocation scheme.

At a minimum, I would expect that cr_hbuf_put() should take a pointer 
rather than a size argument.

This smells like a memory pool abstraction and probably shouldn't be 
specific to cr_ctx at all.
As I mentioned earlier though, you still need to walk the entire 
buffered structure in 'buffered' mode to release COWable object 
references.  Adding a kfree in that path makes the code much easier to 
understand and places the exception/cleanup path in-band rather than 
out-of-band with a memory pool.
