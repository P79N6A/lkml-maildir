Since upgrading from 2.4.19 to 2.5.41, my ISA-PCMCIA bridge is
no longer detected. It is detected as follows in 2.4.19, and also
works in 2.5.7, the only other 2.5 kernel I've tried.
Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
Intel PCIC probe:
  Vadem VG-469 ISA-to-PCMCIA at port 0x3e2 ofs 0x00, 2 sockets

In 2.5.41, loadling the i82356 module results in a "no such device"
message.
