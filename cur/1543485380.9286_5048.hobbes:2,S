Couldn't this be handled purely in userspace with a modified rm?
Add a flag, --quick or --background to rm which causes it to
do the following:
1) Fork a child copy of itself
2) tell the child copy to open for read all files which are
   about to be deleted (although this may run into the number of 
   possible open file descriptors problem)
3) the parent then performs a normal unlink on all the
   files, which should be very fast because none of them will be
   removed from the filesystem (since the child has them open)
4) the parent tells the child it is done and exits
5) the child closes each file or exits
This is slightly better than just rm file & because when the
prompt returns, the file does not exist in the filesystem 
namespace.
