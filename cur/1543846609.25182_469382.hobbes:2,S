Yes, I'm pointing at the correct MAC, but since wireshark doesn't see in the 
networl, I doubt anything actually is sent. 
No, I have not tried to compile netconsole into the kernel because of 
flexibility. Anyway, I have investiaged further:
I ran this systemtap script: 
probe module("netconsole").function("write_msg@drivers/net/netconsole.c") {
        printf("WriteMsg called\b")
}
Once this script was run, I rmmod and modprobe'd my wireless-module a few 
times to generate some dmesg output, but according to systemtap, this 
function never gets called. 
So, either the call to register_console in netconsole fails, is wrong or there 
is a but in register_console
Thanks
