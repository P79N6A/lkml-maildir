Subject: Problem with devfs and Unix98 pty

The automatic saving and reloading of permissions and ownerships
by devfsd is not compatible with Unix98 ptys (in /dev/pts). 
Imagine a user A trying to get a pty, for example by starting an
xterm. If there's a saved inode /dev-state/pts/<whatever> owned by
user B, and the next free number in /dev/pts equals <whatever>,
devfsd will replace the automatically created inode with the saved,
which is owned by B. So A does not have any chance at all to get 
another pty.
I propose to add the following lines to the default devfsd.conf,
just above the last three lines:
REGISTER        ^pts/.*         IGNORE
CHANGE          ^pts/.*         IGNORE
CREATE          ^pts/.*         IGNORE
This fixed the problem for me. If you know a better solution,
please let me know.
