Does acpi cause the change_page_attr oopses?
What caused the several different oopses which I got with Andrew's config? 
They were all inside the gregkh-driver-* series.  (That test machine is
running FC1, which doesn't run udev at all.  Its BIOS is acpi-free).
Here's one:

I didn't grab the others.

Tried Andrew's .config?

I can tell an enormous string of oopses when I see one ;)
I'm dropping acpi and gregkh-driver-* and am rushing rc4-mm1.  Other
people's stuff needs to get tested.
