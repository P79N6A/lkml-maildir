Very likely. And in the vfork() case it is definitely WRONG to try to
reschedule (either threads _or_ processes), since the parent is going to
go to sleep real soon now.
I think this code:
                        if (clone_flags & CLONE_VM)
                                wake_up_forked_thread(p);
                        else
                                wake_up_forked_process(p);
is just wrong, and it should be replaced with
			wake_up_new_process(p, clone_flags);
and then "wake_up_new_process()" can do the right thing, which is 
basically:
	if (clone_flags & CLONE_VFORK)
		synchronous wakeup, same as pipe-will-block case
	else if (clone_flags & CLONE_VM)
		thread-wakeup-case
	else
		process-wakeup-case
No?
