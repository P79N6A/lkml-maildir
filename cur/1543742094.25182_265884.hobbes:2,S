  The iounmap/ioremap path in serial8250_release/request_port is
terribly unbalanced.  The UPF_IOREMAP flag is used to determine if a
port gets ioremap'd, but plays no part in whether it gets iounmap'd.
It's easy to see how an MMIO serial port can be passed through
uart_set_info and end up with an unmapped membase.  The results is a
non-functional UART or worse.  I've tried to generate some discussion on
the proper fix for this, but I haven't succeeded.  I propose the patch
below as a safe compromise.  An MMIO uart w/ a mapbase, but no membase
doesn't seem viable to me.  Thanks,
	Alex
