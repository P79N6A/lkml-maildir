I tried the force driver on my nForce2 machine and although it mostly works 
(DHCP works, I can receive mail over the interface, etc..) it doesn't seem to 
handle really bulky loads. For example, I'm running an FTP server on the 
machine (proftpd), and although FTP navigation works just fine, transferring 
large files just causes the transfer to hang indefinitely.
Removing the driver and using NVIDIA's proprietary driver allows me to 
transfer via FTP properly.
