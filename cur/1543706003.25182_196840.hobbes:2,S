Hi,
I noticed that 2.6.2-mm1, usb scanner is removed. With
vanilla 2.6.2, this modules always OOP and somebody
said we should use libusb instead. However after
googling for a while I can not find any documentation
how to use that even in the libusb homepage. Please
help me , or pinpoint some place I could have some
guides. Thank
you.
