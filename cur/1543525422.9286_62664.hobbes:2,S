Where is this option? I couldn't find it on 2.3.xx kernels...
There is another means of having something similar to trunking with no need from any support from the ethernet switch (it needs an ethernet switch, though).
On newer kernels (at least 2.3.xx series) there is support for QoS. One of the queuing disciplines is sch_teql (true equalizer). If you have more than one ethernet interface, you may use this queuing discipline to do load-balancing between the cards.
