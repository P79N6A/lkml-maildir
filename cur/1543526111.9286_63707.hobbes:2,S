well, let's agree on this. I agree with Linus that the latest version of
/dev/microcode patch is ok, so if he accepts it as is (i.e. a char misc
driver on minor=184) it will be fine.
I also can save a minor number and implement the /proc/driver/microcode.
I cannot (right now) implement a devfs-aware version /dev/cpu/microcode
because I have not looked at Richard's devfs stuff yet.
Of Linus' /proc/driver vs /dev argument I understood b) but not a) or
c). Namely,
 a) there is still userspace setup of using ioct on a proc file
 c) whether kernel has update support or not is determined by whether
  the minor=184 is accessible (perhaps by loading a driver) or not.
  /proc does not make things much easier.
but he is right on b) - it saves a minor.
Regards,
Tigran.
