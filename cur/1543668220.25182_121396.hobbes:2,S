The EIP need not exist itself in System.map.  System.map has the symbol
to initial address mapping.  For example,
	100	functionA
	200	functionB
If the EIP was "150" you would be 50 bytes into functionA().

This is not a panic, just an oops.  And it was just a debugging check
from spin lock debugging, but unfortunately you were in an interrupt
handler so the machine went bye bye.
It is probably a simple double-lock deadlock, detected by spin lock
debugging.  Knowing the EIP would help... but timer_interrupt() is a
good first guess.
