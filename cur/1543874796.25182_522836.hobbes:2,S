Works fine with 2.6.21-rc4.  I'm running on that kernel as I type this.

Boot hangs at the point indicated in my original message.  I *did*
notice the blurb in the console messages about the pit clocksource
being selected/used.  There was also a complaint about it being
unstable, with a negative delta.  I think these messages are consistent
with the pre-bad-commit case other than where they appear in the boot
messages.

Sent under separate cover to John.
