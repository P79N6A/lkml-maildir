OK, so it's not in Linus's tree yet.  Jeff, how do you want to handle
this?  (That last patch breaks drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3, and Steve
posted a fix to handle it)
The cleanest thing would be for you to roll up Steve's fix into the
patch you merged, so that Linus's tree is never in the state where it
has half the change merged.  But I don't know if that fits your
workflow.
Thanks...
