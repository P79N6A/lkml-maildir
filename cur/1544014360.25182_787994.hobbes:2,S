I see the problem.
The socket pipes in net/core/skbuff.c use references on the skb
to hold down the memory in skb->head as well as the pages in the
skb.
Unfortunately, once the pipe is fed into sendpage we only use
page reference counting to pin down the memory.  So as soon as
sendpage returns we drop the ref count on the skb, thus freeing
the memory in skb->head, which is yet to be transmitted.
Moral: Using page reference counts on skb->head is wrong.
Cheers,
