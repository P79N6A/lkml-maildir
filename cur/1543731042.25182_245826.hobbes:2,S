Why not ask the netfilter development lists such questions?
Stateful netfilter is not there because it's a total waste
to completely duplicate all of the connection tracking et al.
code into ipv6 counterparts when %80 of the code is roughly
the same.  People are working on a consolidation of these
things so that there is no code duplication but it is a lot
of work and there are bigger fires to put out at the moment.
