Hi all,
Was having trouble with the latest source-in compiling it and did an
mrproper which fixed things...well-temporarily.
I was hitting another issue with permissions-as root :(
I was surprised and did an ls -l on the files and guess what I found:
total 0
?--------- ? ? ? ?                ? fcntl.c
?--------- ? ? ? ?                ? fifo.c
?--------- ? ? ? ?                ? filesystems.c
?--------- ? ? ? ?                ? file_table.c
?--------- ? ? ? ?                ? freevxfs
So end result is that, Im not able to delete the files or change perms
or ownership even as root.
Can some one help please?
How did this even happen?
I could compile without any issues till yesterday and todays update
seems to have caused this...
Not really sure if it is just a local phenomenon....
