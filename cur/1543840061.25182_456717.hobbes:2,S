It's just random data of a known maximum size appended to the struct,
I'm sure you can find a clean way to handle it. If you mangle the
first variable name in your union, you'll end up with something that
should be usable instead of udata.

Well, I can't find any use of pointers in your struct ukevent, nor in
any of the kqueue events in my man page. So if this is a deficit it
applies to both, I guess?
