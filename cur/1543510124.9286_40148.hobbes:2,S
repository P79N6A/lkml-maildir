Actually, it was buggy, because locking socket while holding hash lock
is no-no-no.
OK. Actually, you did exactly the thing, which I tried to avoid (new lock)
and, probably, it is better than way which I advocated.
[ I wanted to use normal socket spinlock for this: it is faster,
but results in some aestetical problems. ]
BTW you can kill lhash sleep lock now. rwlock is enough.
