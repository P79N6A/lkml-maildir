But it's entirely legal for a semaphore to wait forever when used in the
way I've used them, a producer/consumer pattern.  You should be able to
run happily (at least as happily as before) with the watchdog disabled.
This begs the question of what to do about the 99.99% of cases where the
watchdog is a good thing to have.  Shouldn't the watchdog just log the
'suspicious' event and continue?
