Hello,
I have submitted a patch for the 3x-xxxx driver on
alpha several months ago to both the driver maintainer
and the linux-scsi mailing list.
I have read all the FAQ and I tried to stick to the
instructions to the letter.
However the patch has been completely ignored. No
reply, no comment, no flames, absolutely nothing...
the original email submission is at the end of the
email.
could anyone please explain what I am doing wrong?
thanks,
GG
[PATCH 2.6.22] 3w-xxxx: Fix bad unaligned accesses on
alpha SMP
disable packing of the TAG_TW_Device_Extension
structure to prevent kernel unaligned accesses when
accessing ioctl_wqueue.
Fixes smartmontools kernel panic on alpha SMP
