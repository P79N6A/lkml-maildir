I thought there was a reasonable chance of that! =)

Ah, OK. Makes sense.

Agreed. I said that wasn't a bug. =)

Doh!! Didn't see the VIA driver down there at the bottom. Double doh! My 
appologies, I should have been able to figure that out.
That works quite well, thank you! Still have a question though...

But, what about the case when I built in the generic driver, but made 
the CMD649 driver a module, and loaded it after boot. That shouldn't 
have *changed* what ide0 and ide1 are, right? I had ide0 and ide1 
assigned, did a modprobe, and CMD649 changed what ide0 adn ide1 where, 
and then forgot about the previous ones.. like all of a sudden it told 
the generic driver "no, no, you were wrong, there's no VIA chipset here, 
go back to sleep."
I may well be misunderstanding something precedence in the kernel here, 
but I figured while I'm bugging you, I might as well get the full picture.
Thanks for your time!
