I'm ashamed to say, I know. It has been reported to me about three months 
ago, I coded patches, but I did not have the time to test them carefully.
The problem is that inside the epoll wakeup callback, we don't know which 
even we got (and we can't call ->poll()). So we add the fd to the 
ready-list and we wake up the waiters. The current code simply does return 
EPOLLIN (from epoll's poll()) if the ready-list is not empty. The problem 
is that the even we received in the epoll callback could have been a 
POLLIN when the fd is waiting for POLLOUT. THis situations gets sorted out 
in epoll_wait(), but inside epoll's poll() only a quick test was used 
(ready-list not empty).
The patch was not exactly a one-liner, so I need a few days to double 
check it and test it. I'll try to do it this w/end.
