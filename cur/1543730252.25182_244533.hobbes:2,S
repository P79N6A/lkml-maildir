hmmm,  I have tried a number of things, and it seems to be only affected 
[so far] by heavy NFS use.  This was like completely dead.   I see that 
other people are having a hard time w/ CFQ and 2.6.8.1 however all 
related to swap. I think I will see what I can do w/ 2.6.8.1 and AS.
Now that emerge has finished w/ scanning the portage tree, even though I 
am reading MP3's from nfs and untar'ing source from NFS all is well.
I can't reboot just now, but soon.   Also, right now I am compiling a 
bunch of updates to Gentoo, and I am experiancing great success.   So it 
could be a regression, but I don't know.
I just tried a couple more things, and am re-scanning w/ emerge, and the 
behaviour has returned.  My rdesktop sessions are as smooth as glass, 
but anything local is tanking.
thanks,
   Joshua
