Sorry I've taken a while to reply - I've had other things on my plate
and not much time for orinoco work.  Any details you have would be
useful.
In particular any error messages would be handy - since the crash
might prevent them getting to syslog, try switching to a text console
and running "dmesg -n 8" to request that all messages, including debug
level ones go to the console immediately.  Then trigger the bug and
see if any messages appear on the console.
