Do you mean this program ?
int count, pfd[2];
for (count = 0 ; count < 10000000 ; count++) {
	pipe(pfd);
	close(pfd[0]);
	close(pfd[1]);
}
The problem is you wont see the overhead of insert/delete the inode in a 
global tree, since you keep hot caches.
To have a better estimate of the overhead, I suggest you try to use more 
active pipes like :
#include <unistd.h>
#define SIZE 16384
int fds[SIZE];
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        unsigned int i , count ;
        for (i = 0 ; i < SIZE ; i += 2)
                pipe(fds + i);
        i = 0;
        for (count = 0 ; count < 10000000 ; count++) {
                close(fds[i]);
                close(fds[i + 1]);
                pipe(fds + i);
                i = (i + 2) % SIZE;
        }
        return 0;
}
# ulimit -n 20000
# time ./pipebench
