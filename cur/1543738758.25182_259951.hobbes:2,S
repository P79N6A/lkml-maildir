Well with all the fun and the mind bendiness of the results of my
earlier tests I thought that there might be a slim chance that something
got buggered up with the lifetime of patching that particular kernel
tree got on my system and since rc4 was out I decided to start afresh.
I untarred 2.6.5, patched to 2.6.9-rc4, turned on the PCI debugging as
per request, compiled and rebooted. End result?

It worked!
Now thinking that I may have just right royally buggered up I compiled
rc3 again, starting from a totally fresh tree like I did with rc4 and
the problem was still there. No promise card. (phew... kinda)
So basically, something got fixed between rc3 and rc4. Personally, I
call shenanigans.
