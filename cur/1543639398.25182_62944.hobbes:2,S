Trying out the amd76x_pm driver with 2.4.19-ac4 on a Tyan Thunder K7X 
(S2468UGN) produces hard hangs under load. The system looks okay when idle, 
but heavy Disk I/O (onboard SCSI, basically tar cfz) produces the hang 
within a few minutes. (No hangs unless the amd76x_pm module is loaded.)
The board is otherwise quite stable (i.e. no unexplained 
hangs/crashes/panics).
Any suggestions on how to approach this? The C2 idle loop code is what 
changed for me (from 2.4.19pre10-ac2). But I don't know enough about ACPI 
to know where to start... what info would help?
Oh, and this driver (while it works) shaves a full 140W off the power 
consumption. Cool.
Thanks
