	Obviously we need the full functionality, not just some part
of it.

	The downside of that is that things need to be predefined. As
we are doing a "WPA API" and not a "generic link layer security API",
that's OK.
	The other thing you may want to think about is miving all
string/arrays at the end of the definition so that we can grow them
easily if needed, and so that the first part can be fixed.

	That's easy to fix. I did the same with "iwpriv" definitions a
couple of weeks ago. Basically, you return -E2BIG to user space until
userspace give you a big enough buffer.
	I'll try to fix that.

	You currently have your plate pretty full. I'll try to help,
but my first son was born one month ago and things are not as smooth
as planned.
