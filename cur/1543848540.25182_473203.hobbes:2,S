Yeah, you are right about that. Unfortunately there isn't a good
way to do this at the moment... well we could disable preempt
around the section, but that would be silly for a PREEMPT kernel.
And we should really decouple it from preempt entirely, in case we
ever want to check for it some other way in the pagefault handler.
