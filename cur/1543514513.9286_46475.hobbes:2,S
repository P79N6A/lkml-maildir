When replying to this thread last night I had an insight which I think
will fix some of the problems I've been having, if it's correct.
I was being confused because there are two types of bus addresses, which
I (and maybe Patrick) had been confusing because they seem to be the same
thing sometimes.  (i.e. they live in the same PCI address space)
Host memory bus addresses are used on the PCI bus by PCI devices to 
initiate DMA to/from host memory.  They may pass through something like 
the sun IOMMU on the way into the machine to map 32-bit bus addresses 
onto bigger (or just different) host memory physical addresses.  You get 
host-memory bus addresses from virt_to_bus().
Device bus addresses are used on the PCI bus by the CPU to initiate reads/
writes to the PCI device.  They are interpreted directly by the device as 
an offset from one of its base registers.  (note that I'm ignoring I/O 
spaces - whether memory mapped or i/o mapped - for this discussion, and 
just worrying about PCI memory transactions)
The combination of PCI setup, ioremap() and readl/writel convert device
memory-space bus addresses into kernel virtual addresses which are
dereferenced to access the device.  The address translation that occurs
here occurs in the outgoing direction, using some combination of readl/
writel and virtual memory mapping.
So I believe I've just convinced myself that it's completely illegal to
call bus_to_virt on device bus addresses, as the purpose of bus_to_virt
is to undo the IOMMU mapping, not to undo the ioremap mapping.  Of course,
the fact that bus=phys on x86 makes it hard to test these theories...
