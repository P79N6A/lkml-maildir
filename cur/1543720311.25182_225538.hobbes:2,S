Yes, that would be one advantage of having a PE loader in the kernel. 
David Howells of Redhat was working on a kernel module that implemented 
all of the wineserver functionality, including a PE loader a while back. 
  Unfortunately that effort did not get anywhere. The code is still at:
http://cvs.winehq.com/cvsweb/kernel-win32
If there were a PE/COFF binary format handler in the kernel, it would 
still be able to load ELF executables, as Wine requires glibc, X11, etc.
