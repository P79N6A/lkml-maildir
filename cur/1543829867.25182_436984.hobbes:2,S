Architectures will not always have a known fixed start of physical memory. 
On IA64 at least, they initialise memory as if it starts at 0 but on my 
one test machine, the beginning part is always a memory hole. I've seen 
nothing to indicate that this hole will be the same size on all IA64 
machines but I kinda doubt it. Also, arches that use init_bootmem() do not 
necessary use free_area_init().

While you may be right, it'll only fix the problem for arches with 
ARCH_PFN_OFFSET and using init_bootmem (which is the case of MIPS I 
guess). But arches using init_bootmem_node or not using free_area_init() 
may still get kicked.
