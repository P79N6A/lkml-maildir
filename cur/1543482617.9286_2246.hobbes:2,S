OK, ok, shame on me. I suppose sometime (mixing patching up from
2.1.119, make menuconfig, make xconfig and oldconfig mixed) I managed
to _build ELF support as a module_ (sigh). I post this here because 
a) I do not know how it could ever happen --- I just tried to enable
and the disabled again APM --- and b) I saw some other posting similar
to this...
Jens, I am testing your last patch. I left the previous hack in too,
and I am sorry to tell you that it is trimmed in spite of the setting 
of limit_nframes. Sigh.
