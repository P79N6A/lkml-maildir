It's related to the problem of a suid program accessing synthetic
filesystem, and filesystem doing something bad to suid program (make
it hang, supply bogus data ...).  This can be solved by "squashing"
suid for the whole namespace (basically the Plan 9 solution).
Unfortunately this is not really practical in Linux/Unix.

That's a different aspect of this thing.  Private namespaces cannot do
anything about the above problem.
