It only does it when the CPU is busy in any low power mode.  In
maximum power mode it never makes the noise.  It sounds like it's
coming from the speakers (independent of volume control though), but
it might not be.
Would the DC/DC converter noise be explained by a low quality
capacitor used by the converter?
