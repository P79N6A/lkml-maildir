  As I said before. It doesn't matter if it is in the kernel or user
  space. Not to me at least - as long as I could use extend the usage
  of my filesystem with meta-data, my own descriptions, perhaps
  streams, etc in a transparent way. I do not want to be confined to
  only use future Gnome apps.

  No perhaps. But it doesn't make a difference to the ideas of having
  plugins for reiser4 that can give such features.
