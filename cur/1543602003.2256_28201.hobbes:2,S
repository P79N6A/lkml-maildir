SAA9730 is such an extremly buggy piece of silicon that Phillips stopped
supporting it.  So this driver is used for the Atlas board only which
also has been superseeded by the Malta board; and you shouldn't expect any
future development on this driver.  That said, the driver doesn't work
as a module; a quick look at it shows that at least the module_exit()
functionality isn't supported.
