I spoke to soon, turning off NCQ helped dramatically, it worked three times!

Then it crashed again, with NCQ enabled, it would not even complete one test,
So basically a new system, new PSU, new cables, its on a new APC UPS and the 
problem persists even when all disks are on a RAID card, SW raid, it does not 
matter, Velociraptors have problems, I think its time for me to get regular
1TiB disks and be done with it.
