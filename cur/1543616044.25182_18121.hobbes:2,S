I wonder what will survive time to serve as a record of our epoch for
future historians.   Punch cards may have better chance than magnetica
carrier.
I can still read my programs on punch cards from early eighties (you know,
program lines were printed on top of the card,  they just need some sorting
to be operational :) ),  but were are all my floppies from later times ??
So we still may be know in the future as the punch card civilization !  :)
