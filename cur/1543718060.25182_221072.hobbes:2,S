Ok, I produced the "strace"s and "dmesg"s for the kernels 2.6.4, 2.6.5 and 
2.6.6 and made them available at 
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/dmesg_kmail_2.6.4
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/dmesg_kmail_2.6.5
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/dmesg_kmail_2.6.6
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/kmail_trace_2.6.4
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/kmail_trace_2.6.5
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/kmail_trace_2.6.6
Some further information:
My problem occurs already with kernel 2.6.5, and it is indeed NFS related (It 
does not appear on a local home partition). 
I  reproduced the crash with a server exporting an ext2 partition and one 
which exports a reiserfs partition. So far I  only tested servers running  on 
vanilla 2.4.25. Should I check others?
The mount options according to /proc/mount are
viola:/tmp /net/viola/tmp nfs 
rw,nosuid,nodev,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,udp,lock,addr=viola 0 0
The traces were produced by the command lines
strace  2>/tmp/kmail_trace_2.6.x /usr/linux-local/kde/bin/kmail --nofork -s 
test --msg test_mail amann@physik.tu-berlin.de
dmesg > /tmp/dmesg_kmail_2.6.x
(I also tried "strace -f", but apparently exim does not like to be traced?)
From my (limited) point of view, the problem is the ESTALE of an fstat64 call 
in the 2.6.5 trace:

fstat64(8, 0xbfffe650)                  = -1 ESTALE (Stale NFS file handle)
_llseek(8, 0, [373], SEEK_END)          = 0
write(8, "X\1\0\0", 4)                  = -1 ESTALE (Stale NFS file handle)
write(8, "\5\0\0\0,\0\0a\0z\0/\0w\0t\0z\0t\0+\0N\0S\0+\0001\0s"..., 344) = -1 
ESTALE (Stale NFS file handle)

This succeeds in the 2.6.4 trace:

No idea what causes the difference. 
I hope this is the information you expected. Please let me know what further 
checks  I can do.
