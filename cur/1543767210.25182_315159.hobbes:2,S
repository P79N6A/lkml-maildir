Hello Sam and Russell,
thanks, Russell, for defending me through pointing me
as an bad example :-) .
Excuse me for that outcome of my two neurons scratch,
but I have decided to send my ideas for discussion
and possibly to help others. The decision,
what is good thing to do now and what should
be left in air for future better decisions
is on you. Thanks for energy put into reading
and thinking about my ideas.
I provide another idea, which is not dependant
on out of source tree build
ifeq ("$(origin ARCH)", "command line")
prepare1: archpreserve
archpreserve:
	echo "ARCH ?= $(ARCH)" >$(objtree)/.archconfig
	echo "CROSS_COMPILE ?= $(CROSS_COMPILE)" >>$(objtree)/.archconfig
else
-include $(objtree)/.archconfig
endif
With wish of sunny weekend 
                Pavel
