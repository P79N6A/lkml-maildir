You can figure out what it is by reading addresses directly out of
/proc/profile that would correspond to it (i.e. modifying readprofile)
and correlating it with an area of text in a disassembled kernel.
kpmd_ctor() is unusual; how many runs does this profile represent?
Does it represent the first run? Ideally, all your kernel pmd's should
be cached. If it's not the first run, then logged slab cache statistics
would be interesting to determine whether this is still the case even
while effective cacheing is going on or whether slab cache reaping is
blowing these things away (i.e. either ineffective cacheing is happening
or for some reason cacheing them isn't good enough).
Of course, it would probably be better to deal with first-order effects
first. On that note, how many profile hits total? How many runs is this
summed together from? Which run is this (numerically in the order you
ran them) if the profiles are from only one run?
