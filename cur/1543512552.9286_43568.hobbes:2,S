Hi,
  I did not follow discussion about NMI-deadlock-patch on linux-kernel 
very closely, but I have one small question: How much NMIs there should be
per second? My system gets 100 timer ints (50/s per CPU) and 100 NMIs
delivered to both CPUs (i.e. 200/s total). Is it correct? (I do not know
what happened to two NMIs on CPU0, after reboot counters are in-sync
(I think that it was caused by vmware - I tried it run twice and
I twice got internal bug - probably vmmon is not happy from receiving
periodic NMI - it could be these two)):
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:      25173      24603    IO-APIC-edge  timer
