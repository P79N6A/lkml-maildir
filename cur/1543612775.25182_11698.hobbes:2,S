The sched.c change is also useless (ie. only harmful).  Anton and I looked at
adapting the scheduler for hyperthreading, but it looks like the recent 
changes have had the side effect of making hyperthreading + the current
scheduler "good enough".  If someone wants an in-depth analysis of (1) what
is required to make the "right" decision for hyperthread scheduling with the
current scheduler (much more than the current wedge) and (2) why it doesn't
really matter anyway, please ask.
Anton, can you put the dbench graphs somewhere public?
Cheers,
Rusty.
