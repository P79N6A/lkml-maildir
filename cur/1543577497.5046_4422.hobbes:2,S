The current 2.4 code has lots of room for tuning, since I've been trying to
keep it clean/stable for now (and our dbench numbers show it).  The first
optimization is tuning for reiserfs_get_block, I think writepage clustering
will be easier (and more beneficial) if we work out the buffer.c changes
I've been posting.
I also want to change the log block allocation a bit, so the log blocks are
allocated as the transaction progresses, instead of all at the end.  I
think that will make us much more VM friendly, and let me get rid of the
inode writing kludges.  It'll be a busy weekend ;-)
