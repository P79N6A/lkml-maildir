Pid namespaces have more than a good expectations to be fixed, so
feel free to mark the (currently pending) PID_NS config option with
"depends on EXPERIMENTAL".
All the problems I know are slowly getting fixed, but most of them are
just related to "bad pid value is reported to the user space when we 
work inside some new namespace".
Unfortunately, as I can see, all the discussions of pid namespaces 
happen behind my bask, so all I can is just fix the problems I'm 
aware of.

I'm sure, that no *new* problems appear in case you don't enter the new
namespace, so just disable the pid space creation code (with EXPERIMENTAL 
option) and live with the original kernel.
If you point me one, I'd be glad to fix it.
