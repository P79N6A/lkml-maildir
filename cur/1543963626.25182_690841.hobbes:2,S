Ingo, Would you (or others listening to this discussion) know
exactly what Windows does with respect to BIOS unassigned
expansion ROMs?  Does Windows attempt to obtain space for the
expansion ROMs at boot-time or does it perhaps have some sort
of strategy where space is allocated on an "as needed" basis
at run-time?
