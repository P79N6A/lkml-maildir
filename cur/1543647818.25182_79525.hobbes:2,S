I had similar problems with 2.4.20-pre5-ac6 where my /home partition was
totally killed.  Though I used 2.4.19 to dd it off and ran fsck on
copies till I got it back and remounted it as a ext2 partition.  It had
some really bad corruption in the journal, but as far as I could tell
there was no other corruption.  I originally thought it was bad hard
disk, but I reinstalled to the same drive and no more errors with
2.4.20-pre8-ac3.  I also got all kinds off errors about trying to read
past the end of the device and partition magic said something about the
partition table being corrupt and not being able to determine the
partition type. Though cfdisk didnt say a thing about any of this.  Just
a wierd situation that had me confused for several days.
