Could you remove that block, instead of just disabling it? Bugs spread 
at an incredible rate...
The right approach to avoid the cost of the fget is fget_light. But 
that's an optimization, it can be added later.

What's the difference between remove_wait_queue() and 
local_remove_wait_queue?

You are accounting posix messages in the sysv msg variables. Is that 
something we want, or should posix messages have their own accounting 
variables? I don't know what's better, but it should be discussed.

Would it be possible to sort the waiters according to their prio? 
wake_all is always bad.

Is that comment still correct? You wrote that it's supported in user space.
It looks good.
