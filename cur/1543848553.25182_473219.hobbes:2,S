from the file Documentation/spinlocks.txt:
  "UPDATE March 21 2005 Amit Gud <gud@eth.net>
  Macros SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED and RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED are deprecated and
  will be removed soon."
but it seems that there's still a whole lot of those
SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED macros being used.  so are they deprecated or not?
just curious.
