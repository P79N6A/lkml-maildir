Hello,
Sorry for the noise but I'm trying hard to contact people from the glibc team
for a problem about porting from sco Unix to Linux (binary library compiled
with BDS style header files, for which I have not the sources: I'm looking
for tips on 'glue.c', which seems to be done for that...).
The mailing list is dead. The newsgroup gnu.glibc.bug doen't exists on NTTP
servers I know, and info@gnu.org seems a mail's black hole ! Does the glibc
team still exists ;-)
If some of you could give me pointers to this people, it would help me a lot
in my quest.
