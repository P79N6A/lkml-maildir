Good morning all!
Currently I'm building my kernels on a Dell PE 1800 3.0GHz.  My dilemma
is that I build and rebuild the kernel about twenty times a day and even
though it only takes about 20 minutes, that's rapidly becoming too slow!
Today it's the 2.6.17 kernel on FC5 that I'm building with.
I see all these blurbs out there about someone being able to build a
complete kernel in under a minute or running an SMP build across
multiple CPUS and/or multiple machines.
So, to ask the group that should know the best ... What would be a
reasonable configuration to get my builds down under five minutes or so?
And then to go to the extreme, what kind of horsepower should I be
looking for if I want get the build times down to say a minute or so???
Thanks!
:b!
