Is node 0 guaranteed to be all low-memory? What if it allocates stuff at 
the end of memory on NODE(0)?
Anyway, it sounds like "alloc_bootmem_low_pages()" is seriously buggered 
if it allocates non-low pages, if only because of its name...

Argh. Which one should I pick? The NODE(0) one looks simpler, but is it 
sufficient for now in practice (with the real one going into 2.6.14+)?
