It is something completely different - your color rectangle is xine (or Xv)
still painting to framebuffer although X are no longer visible. If
you are using matroxfb, you should see either single color rectangle
(in overlay mode) or picture from xine (in direct paint mode). With
vgacon you'll see single color areas of strange stable characters in overlay
mode, and multicolored areas of strange changing characters in non-overlay
mode.
VIA corruption exists without X, and appears just immediately, during
kernel boot sequence.
