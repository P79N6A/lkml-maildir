No, and it's also broken. It can deadlock if the user unmaps the page
in another thread.
I've got a fix using getuserpages but it's crashing on my system at
the moment (but not in lguest!).

Agreed.

Well it's not really arbitrary. But these go away in my WIP code.

Done.

Why?

I think so. Consider exec(). This whole area is full of interesting
traps and it pays to be paranoid.
