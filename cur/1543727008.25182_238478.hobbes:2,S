convinience ? speed ?
RBAC is a Good Thing, but I wonder if it could provide throughout syntax analysis
for vfs related syscalls. As it is now.
At least what declared in their docs, fs-wise they are somewhat like this
Macro Name	Description
stat_file_perms	Permissions to call stat or access on a file.
x_file_perms	Permissions to execute a file.
r_file_perms	Permissions to read a file.
rx_file_perms	Permissions to read and execute a file.
rw_file_perms	Permissions to read and write a file.
ra_file_perms	Permissions to read and append to a file.
link_file_perms	Permissions to link, unlink, or rename a file.
create_file_perms	Permissions to create, access, and delete a file.
r_dir_perms	Permissions to read and search a directory.
rw_dir_perms	Permissions to read and modify a directory.
ra_dir_perms	Permissions to read and add entries to a directory.
create_dir_perms	Permissions to create, access, and delete a directory.
mount_fs_perms	Permissions to mount and unmount a filesystem.

Well, I am probably wrong...
p.s. _AND_ if I remember correctly reiser4 supposed to provide finer-then-file grain security.
well, at least it easily could, being truly semantic-enabled fs.
