Subject: [BK PATCH] Driver Core patches for 2.6.7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Here are a bunch of driver core and i2c patches for 2.6.7 (I merged the
two trees, as they were conflicting in spots.)  They contain:
	- some sysfs and driver model attribute core changes
	- fixes to the kernel where people didn't put a ';' at the end
	  of their driver and device attribute definitions.
	- i2c bug fixes 
	- sysfs class support for raw devices, allowing udev to work
	  with raw devices.  This patch is shipping in the SuSE kernel.
	- other sysfs class support patches.
	- sparse cleanups.
These patches used to be in the -mm tree, until last -mm release where
it conflicted with the scsi code too much.  That merge has been fixed
here.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/driver-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
