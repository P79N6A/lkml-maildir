The patch is right, the explanation was wrong. Sorry, I didn't CC l-k when
I found what was really going on. Other source files used a global
initialized variable "divert_if" as well, so this became the same one as
the one referenced in isdn_common.c.  That's why it wasn't zero, it was
explicitly initialized elsewhere. However, making divert_if static in
isdn_common.c fixes the problem, because now it's really local to this
file and therefore initialized to NULL.
