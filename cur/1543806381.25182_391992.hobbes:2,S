Highpoint has some that I believe are software raidish.
They do have on-board parity generators that are used when
you use there binary only modules.
I have heard that they will work with later kernels (2.6.15+)
since the highpoint are a standard Marvell chipset, and they
seem to be fairly price competitive with JBOD raid controllers,
and have some controllers that have more than 8 ports, the price
per port may be better on the larger controllers.
Using 3 disk software stripe (linux) or 3 disks software stripe
(binary modules) I have got IO rates of 135MB/second sustained
over 90-100 GB read/write tests.
