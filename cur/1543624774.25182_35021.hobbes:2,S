   I've actually got a more constructive suggestion for the zebra folks. 
   Route the BGP crap through a netlink tap device, mangle and unmangle the
   tcp frames in luserspace. Saves doing TCP in userspace, saves screwing up
   Dave's nice networking stack.
   
   You'll still need to kill SACK support to make it fit
   
Another solution could involve a netfilter module to mangle
the packets.
