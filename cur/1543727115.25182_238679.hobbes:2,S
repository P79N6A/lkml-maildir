Thanks. I did the rest of the architectures too -- it's all at 
bk://linux-mtd.bkbits.net/quirks-2.6
It probably doesn't want to go to Linus until after 2.6.8 is released,
but perhaps we could put it in the -mm tree until then?
I note that just about everyone has their own identical definition of
pci_fixup_ide_bases(). We should probably clean that up.
