Too bad I didn't remember that from last evening. Sorry.
Anyway, I've switched to the Xorg-X11 radeon driver and have been
running about 20 minutes in the preview mode. No xruns so far so
that's an improvement over last evening. This is at 64/2, so sub-3mS:

Last evening I would have had 5-10 xruns by now.
I'm kicking myself for not cleaning that up earlier. It's one of those
lingering things about ATI drivers and testing new kernels. You load
fglrx because you're running 2.6.13 and it works. You jump to a
testing kernel and the ATI drivers don't support it but you go on
leaving the fglrx call in, and you see the driver load fail at boot
time. I got lazy and never cleaned it up.
My bad...
I wish modprobe.conf was in /lib/modules/XXX so that the modules
loaded could be changed from kernel to kernel.
Anyway, better and better. We'll see how today goes.
Thanks!
