Making the code separate helps also for testing it in usermode (minus
the lock), so I haven't had to reboot (yet) :)

What about leaving kfifo_alloc as is (using kmalloc) and adding
	struct kfifo *kfifo_init(unsigned char *buffer, spinlock_t *lock);
which let's you specify the buffer and the spinlock you want to use.
Of course, one should not call kfifo_free() on such a struct kfifo...
As a special case, the spinlock can be NULL and in this case it 
allocates it. But in this case we should also make a kfifo_delete()
to deallocate the lock...

See above for the lock.
It is better to use an external lock if you want to use it for more
that just protecting the fifo. Unfortunately we cannot hide the
internal spinlock from the users, this is just C.
