Yes, hopefully we can use some inotify bits when it comes time to do it.

I am in complete agreement here. Inotify was not designed with any of
this in mind. Inotify was designed with the desktop in mind. I think a
more realistic approach would be to get inotify in, then refactor from
there. Creating a generic layer that contains some of the inotify code
plus whatever is needed to implement this audit stuff. Then the audit
system and inotify could use this layer for the nitty gritty.
