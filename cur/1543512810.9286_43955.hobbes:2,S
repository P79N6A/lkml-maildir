AFAIK, the es1371 is not an OSS driver (look in the kernel config, you
notice it has an option for oss or something like that)

Not really, I have 2 sound cards in one of my machine (the one above is in a
diskless box).  I have both an es1370 (sb pci64) and an sb16 vibra in the
same machine.  /dev/sndstat only shows the sb16.  Matter of fact,
/proc/sound is exactly the same output.
