I let my SMP box run overnight. WHEN there was a crash when writing CF
(perhaps every 2 weeks or so), THEN I got sometimes BIG problems with
writing even after a reboot - locked up again immediatly.
IIRC my workaround was to remove the modules and load them again
before using them. Yes, sounds weird.
I tried to analyse the problem but gave up. I used usb-uhci on 2.4.9
to 2.4.18-SuSE
