export zap_page_range for XPMEM
XPMEM would have used sys_madvise() except that madvise_dontneed()
returns an -EINVAL if VM_PFNMAP is set, which is always true for the pages
XPMEM imports from other partitions and is also true for uncached pages
allocated locally via the mspec allocator.  XPMEM needs zap_page_range()
functionality for these types of pages as well as 'normal' pages.
