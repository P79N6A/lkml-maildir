That would require a lot of changes to save/restore the segmentation
register at kernel entry/exit since there is no swapgs on i386. 
And will be likely slower there too and also even slow down the

Still might be the best option.
How did that rumoured Xenolinux-over-VMI implementation solve that problem?
