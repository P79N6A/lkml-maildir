My guess would be either (1) miscompilation or (2) hardware problems.
Ad (1): Don't use gcc-2.95 without -fno-strict-aliasing.
        Don't forget make oldconfig; make dep; make clean
Ad (2): Does this kernel run on another machine?
        Does another kernel run on this machine?
	Memory/CPU testing: Memory testers: memtest86.
	                    100 kernel compilations
			    targzippping kernel source tree, untarring and
                             comparing several times.
Just some ideas.
