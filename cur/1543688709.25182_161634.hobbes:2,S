Yes, I did some quick tests and the "host controller" error appears to
be gone. Thanks! There are a few other problems, probably unrelated to
this patch:
1. Broadcom Bluetooth USB device initialization is unreliable. When it
   fails, the following is logged. Rebooting the system and trying again
   helps.
 /etc/hotplug/usb.agent: Setup bluefw for USB product a5c/2033/a0
 /etc/hotplug/usb.agent: Module setup bluefw for USB product a5c/2033/a0
 bluefw[3079]: Loading firmware to usb device 0a5c:2033
 kernel: usb 1-2: bulk timeout on ep1in
 bluefw[3079]: Intr read #1 failed. Connection timed out (110)
 usbfs: USBDEVFS_BULK failed dev 3 ep 0x81 len 10 ret -110
2. The system sometimes locks up in a complete freeze when an external
   Bluetooth device tries to connect. I'm not sure what happens and the
   only message I've seen is this and it might be unrelated:
 dund[3932]: MSDUN failed. Protocol error(71)
3. The following messages are still logged:
 kernel: l2cap_recv_acldata: Frame is too short (len 1)
 kernel: l2cap_recv_acldata: Unexpected continuation frame (len 124)
 kernel: l2cap_recv_acldata: Unexpected continuation frame (len 102)
