Please god no.   The inability to schedule is a bug that apparently
was fixed after sles9 forked off.
In mainline it is safe to sleep until the very end of do_exit and
your suggest patch breaks that.
None of your patches are necessary for mainline.
I believe the commit below is the one that really fixed this issue,
although it may have been something earlier.  But it may have been
earlier, and there have been some significant clean ups since then.
