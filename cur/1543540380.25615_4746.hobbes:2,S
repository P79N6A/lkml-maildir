As a non-kernel hacker I'd guess that after the seconds of full speed, your RAM
buffers are full and need to be flushed to disk, so you network speed drops to
disk speed. And the 80% usage may be due to the IO overhead of PIO or DMA. This,
of course, implies that you are actually downloading something to disk, but
because you say "ftp", it is likely that you do not ftp to /dev/null. You could
try that, maybe it's faster. :o)
