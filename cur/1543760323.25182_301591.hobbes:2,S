Yep. The basic console we already have. Everyone who wants eye candy can switch
from basic console to user space console in early userspace.

P.S. Many years ago, when I discussed integrating the so-called `abstract
     console driver', which allowed to have vgacon and fbcon in the kernel, I
     also pondered to make the console a simple tty in response to a `KISS'
     request. Now it's time to make that happen ;-)
