Actually, in the real code, there are printk's showing this function flow
all over it. I just removed them to leave the code clean and show only the
logic.
Just for information, though, this part of the code is never reached.

This is _not_ the interrupt handler, this is the function to which
dev->hard_start_xmit() points to. Furthermore, isn't the test_and_set_bit
call the one that sets tbusy to 1 ?? At least that's what I thought. Also,
I thought that [set/clear]_bit functions were used because they are
atomic, which ensures that they work fine even in SMP systems (as oposed
to using 'dev->tbusy = 1' directly). Isn't that correct?

I only have to tell the upper layer that it can't write more data to the
device during the DMA write, and that's why I don't need to turn tbusy to
0 _only_ when the TX completion interrupt happens (this board is capable
of transferring several packets at once, with only one interrupt back at 
the end of the whole DMA transfer). Once I wrote to the DMA buffer, the
device is ready to receive more data from the upper layer, and that's
when I set tbusy back to 0 (still in the queue_xmit function).

_BUT_ for this device, as it has _large_ DMA buffers (you can queue up to
32KB of TX data per channel), the driver doesn't need to wait until the
board has actually physically placed the data in the line to tell the
upper layer that it's ready to receive more data. Once the data from the
upper layer is in the DMA buffer, the driver is ready to receive more data
from the upper layer. That's why tbusy is _set_ and _cleared_ in the same
function (cpc_queue_xmit, which is dev->hard_start_xmit).
Did you see the difference? Is this a wrong thing to do? Please let me
know. And thanks for your helpful reply.
