Ok here we go,
final results:
 2.6.8-rc1: OK
 2.6.8-rc2: OK
 2.6.8-rc3: OK
 2.6.8-rc3-bk1: OK
 2.6.8-rc3-bk2: OK
 2.6.8-rc3-bk3: OK
 2.6.8-rc3-bk4: OK
 2.6.8-rc4: BUG!
So, assuming that everything went fine during testing, the bug got introduced 
in the transition between 2.6.8-rc3-bk4 and 2.6.8-rc4.
