Subject: SIS900 module detects two transceivers, picks the wrong one

Hello,
I am having trouble with the SIS900 driver module v1.08.04. The module
installs correctly and does not return an error, but ... well... 
Perhaps dmesg will explain better:
eth0: AMD79C901 HomePNA PHY transceiver found at address 2.
eth0: AMD79C901 10BASE-T PHY transceiver found at address 3.
eth0: using transceiver found at address 2 as default
eth0: SiS 900 PCI Fast Ethernet at 0xec400, IRQ 11, 00:30:67:09:53:81.
So the network interface is a multi-function device, built onto the
motherboard. The driver picks the HomePNA transceiver, but I want to use
the 10BASE-T transceiver. Is there an option I can pass, or some code I
can edit that force the driver to pick the 10BASE-T transceiver at
address 3?
I have attempted to manually configure the device with ifconfig, but I
get the feeling that ifconfig talks to the hardware through the driver,
and since the driver is pointing to the wrong place... I have gotten
nowhere with that approach.
This is an AMD EasyNow PC -- The POST does not display useful
information (it's a graphic of the computer that lights up). I have yet
to find a way into the BIOS configuration screen, or I would try turning
the HomePNA device off from there.
The documentation for this module lists cmhuang@sis.com.tw and
ollie@sis.com.tw as maintainers for the SIS900 module, but my e-mail
to them apparently did not go through. 
Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered. Please cc: replies
