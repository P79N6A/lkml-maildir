I wish everyone else would see it that way!  (But some people do
have valid scenarios where it can't just be ruled out completely.)

Not quite, I think: you need to pass 'write' to get_user_pages()
initially; but at the end, if it was indeed writing into user space,
you need to do the set_page_dirty_lock thing on each of the pages
before page_cache_release, just in case a race cleaned them before
the DMA completed.  I think (I've never used it myself).
