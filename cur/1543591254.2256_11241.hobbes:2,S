Hello,
This is known issue. cmpci driver included in the kernel is way too old.
I'm using newer driver (revision 4.14) and it works just fine. It was 
announced on lkml long time ago. Last time I checked there was even newer
driver - 5.64. The one in the kernel has version 2.41. Is it possible to 
include the new driver?
