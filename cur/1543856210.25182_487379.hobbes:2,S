I digged deeper:
* the same happens with older kernels (I tried 2.6.17.13 for instance)
* the handoff works every time when "USB Keyboard Support" is disabled
  in my BIOS
* the handoff doesn't work when I enable "USB Keyboard Support" and use
  the keyboard at the lilo prompt (up, down, enter ...). It does work,
  though, when I keep my hands afk.
I also increased the wait time from 5 seconds to 20 in
drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c but that didn't change anything. I guess
the bios won't release OHCI in order to be able to serve keyboard input
without usb hid drivers once I hit a key when bios is still in charge.
But I looked around and couldn't see any ill effects so I'll stop
bothering you with this ;-)

Sebastian
