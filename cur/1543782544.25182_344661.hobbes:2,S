Bah, of course, that's inaccurate because you unconditionally set the
secondary to the default.  So, indeed, the default case (nothing actively
loaded as secondary) will get secondary_ops filled with NULL only.
Seems simplest to just fill the default with cap calls where applicable,
but I had hoped to eliminate that.
