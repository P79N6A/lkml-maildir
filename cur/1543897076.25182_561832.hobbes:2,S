Subject: [PATCH] pcmcia: ppc64 needs 32-bit ioaddr_t

ppc64 really needs ioaddr_t to be 32-bit, since I/O addresses really are
MMIO addresses, and remapped at an offset that's well above 16 bits in
some cases.
While the type is exported to userspace, there hasn't been any platforms
with PCMCIA on 64-bit powerpc until now, so changing it won't regress
any existing users.
