due to the other argument i listed:

It's a basic kernel maintainance issue: lguest/KVM and Linux host and 
guest will co-evolve foward in a natural way as they are in essence 
Linux-internal technologies. They /will/ harmonize. There is no such 
guarantee with Xen/VMWare/etc. (which are distinctly separate 
technologies) - so any ABIs towards them could become (and are already 
becoming) a drag and distraction.

oh, but that way i have cleverly pushed the problem out of Linux and 
into the VMI-ROM's domain ;) Which is all i care about.
really, one of my jobs as a maintainer is to keep crap out of Linux (we 
are capable of adding enough crap ourselves ;-). Having multiple, 
overlapping, technologically redundant ABIs between /software/, embedded 
into the heart of the kernel (paravirt ops nonwithstanding), for 
perpetuity, is one such type of crap. It is in fact the kind of crap i'm 
/most/ worried about, because it sticks forever.
