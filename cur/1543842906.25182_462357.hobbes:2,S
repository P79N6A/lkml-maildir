Ingo's patch was wrong.  Here's an update:
Subject: [patch] i386-PDA, lockdep: fix %gs restore
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
in the syscall exit path the %gs selector has to be restored _after_ the
last kernel function has been called. If lockdep is enabled then this
kernel function is TRACE_IRQS_ON.
[ Make sure the move to %gs retains its exception label - jeremy@xensource.com ]
