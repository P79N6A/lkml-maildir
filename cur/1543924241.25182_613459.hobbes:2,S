Not really.

The class devices as childs get their own subdirectory at the parent. So
it would be /sys/block/sda/bdi/sda
It's currently only implemented for class devices which get a bus device
as a parent, but that will be for all parents, so that we prevent
clashing names if devices from multiple subsystems get the same parent.
See here for netdevs there is a "net" "glue directory":
  $ ls -l /sys/class/net/eth0
  /sys/class/net/eth0 -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:02:00.0/net/eth0
We needed this, because people complained that they can't name their
netif "irq", because there is already an attribute at the parent with
that name. :)
When we get the "block as devices" patch merged, we can do the proper
parent logic for bdi, and I'll add the same logic as we have for bus
device parents today.
