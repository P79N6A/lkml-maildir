Right after it was made I found out that it had broken mmap.  Rui sent me
a patch, then another.  Seems he has committed most of that patch to CVS
now but there are differences still.  I'm not sure if the differences are
actually still important, I may have to try building fresh CVS to be sure.
I don't know for sure if that's why Alan hasn't applied the new driver,
but it was an issue that would have broken the patch he was given which is
supposed to be fixed now.  I'm thinking Rui has gotten busy in the
meantime since he's been rather quiet lately.

<jt> should a bug be marked critical if it only affects one arch?
<james-workaway> jt: rc for that arch maybe, but those kind of arch
                 specific bugs are rare...
<jt> not when it's caused by a bug in gcc
<doogie> jt: get gcc removed from that arch. :)
