I have a long standing idea on modifying poll/read/write behavior on
regular files opened in O_NONBLOCK mode. How about the following scheme:
   * poll returns POLLIN/POLLOUT on regular files only if the data are
   in buffer cache/there is room for write().
   * read returns EAGAIN if the data are not in buffer cache.
   * write returns EAGAIN if there is no room (yet) to store the data.
All the operation should signal to IO subsystem that the data are
needed in cache/the room has to be freed.
