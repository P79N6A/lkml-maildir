Hi,
My boss is wondering if we should upgrade our current Intel Pentium
166's with the Kingston Turbo-Chip Processor Upgrades.  The new one coming
out is supposed to be a AMD K6-2 366 Mhz w/ 3D-Now.  It's my job to
make that decision so I need some help.
I was wondering if anyone has anything bad or good to say about the CPU's.
And most importantly if they are stable under Linux 2.2.x.
Thanks,
Tuan
