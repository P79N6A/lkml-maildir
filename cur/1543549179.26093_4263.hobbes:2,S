I haven't had a chance to really look at Peter's mods yet, but surely
the current elevator can have many entries with 0 sequence. As an
example, say the start sequence is 3 and we received request sector
10...1 in descending order. The sorted order would then be
7[3] 8[2] 9[1] 10[0] 3[3] 4[2] 5[1] 6[0] 1[3] 2[2]
(sector[sequence])
