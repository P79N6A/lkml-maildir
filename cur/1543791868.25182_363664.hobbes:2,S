What was the problem with drivers ? On ppc64, it's all hidden in the
arch code. All the kernel sees is a 64k page size. I extended the PTE to
contain tracking informations for the 16 sub pages (HPTE bits & hash
slot index). Sub pages are faulted on demand and flushed all at once,
but it's all transparent to the generic code.
