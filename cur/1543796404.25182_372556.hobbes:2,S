What you're suggesting sounds just like going back to the old style of
development where 2.<even>.x is stable, and 2.<odd>.x is development.
You might as well just suggest that after 2.6.16, we fork to 2.7.0, and
2.6.17+ will be stable increments like we always used to do.
You're just munging the version scheme :)
