Thanks Alan.  That seemed to solve the problem with the SCSI resets and
media change errors, but I'm still having the problem with the tar files.
As a reminder, if I do, say:
  tar -xvf tarfile
it will get part the way through, and then stop. Indefinitely.  If I move
the mouse, it continues.  If the file is large enough, it stops again.
IOW *ALL* disk activity stops. Moving the mouse continues. Rinse, repeat.  
Very, very bizarre.
