Oh, I know what make oldconfig is. Use it all the time. This patch differs
in that is defaults to Y for everything it doesn't know about. If you have
no .config and run make oldconfig, you get the defaults from
arch/*/defconfig and then basically "random values"[1] for everything
else. If you do the same with make phatconfig, the random values are
replaced with Y's. You get _everything_ included, but honor the default
values in arch/*/defconfig.
If you have an empty .config, make oldconfig acts like make config; with
phatconfig it says "Y" to every bool/tristate and the default for every
other type of question. This creates the phattest kernel possible (and
also doesn't come close to compiling, at least under i386). 
If you have meaningful data in .config (including minimal stuff like
# cat .config
CONFIG_M386=y
CONFIG_SOUND=n
) and run make oldconfig, it stops on everything except that listed;
phatconfig says Y to everything except that which is listed in .config
(this makes it useful to disable the stuff that doesn't compile :)
So, its a bit different. Its to exploit kernel bloat to the max. So far I
haven't been able to get a kernel to compile yet (because of conflicts),
but I'm slowly disabling stuff one-by-one so I'll eventually get there.
[1] Some are on, some are off, lowlevel drivers certainly aren't included.
G'day!
