why do you then bring up the atomic bitop operation here?

this is the non-atomic bitop operation.

Neither of these exist in the kernel.

Which means for architectures which implement bitops out of line (due
to their size) that you end up making those architectures even more
inefficient because they now have to decode the "mode" parameter which
will take several compares and branches.
The only way around that would be for such architectures to do:
#define clear_bit_mode(bit,addr,mode)	clear_bit_mode_##mode(bit,addr)
and then we're back to the named function approach.
Incidentally, you say that the named function approach is not extensible.
Do you have a limit on the number of functions you can have in your
kernel?  If not, I don't see where such a statement would come from -
you obviously can extend "clear_bit_atomic" and "clear_bit_nonatomic"
by adding eg, "clear_bit_barrier".  And if you really want to multiplex
them through one function, you can do:
#define clear_bit_atomic(bit,addr)	clear_bit_mode(bit,addr,MODE_ATOMIC)
#define clear_bit_nonatomic(bit,addr)	clear_bit_mode(bit,addr,MODE_NONATOMIC)
#define clear_bit_barrier(bit,addr)	clear_bit_mode(bit,addr,MODE_BARRIER)
etc.
