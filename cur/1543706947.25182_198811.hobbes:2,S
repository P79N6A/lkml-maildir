Please fill bugzilla entry (htp://bugzilla.kernel.org)
and attach 'dmesg' and 'lspci -vvv -xxx' outputs for 2.4.20 and 2.6.x.
It would be also helpful to narrow down the issue to kernel version when
this slowdown started (2.4.20 -> 2.6.x means too much changes to anybody
sane to even start thinking about going through all of them).
