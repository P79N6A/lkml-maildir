Other than my 2.6.15 not producing those last three lines, looks good.
The names are those in /sys, which of course many distros change in udev
to make things hard for the user. Hard t write an app portably to cope
with /dev/scd0, /dev/sr0, /dev/cdroms/sr0, etc.
I am NOT suggesting changing a stable interface, but this really should
be in /sys I would think. It would be nice to have the major/minor and
model info, so programs could find the "better" named in /dev or just
mknod their own.

This would appear to be almost all the user needs to at least find the
devices. I don't know why no one mentioned it several years ago.
