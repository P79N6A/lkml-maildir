With today's software I'd say you probably need swap if you have
less than 256M of RAM and use X. You _definitely_ need it if you have less 
than 128M.
X is regularly uses 50+ megs, Mozilla and OpenOffice are big
leaky beasts too. Hopes for improvements are dim.
Really, we have to fight software bloat instead of adding tons of RAM
and swap, but sadly we have quite a number of vital desktop software
packages overbloated.
I am enormously grateful for all kernel developers for Linux kernel
which is:
Memory: 124644k/129536k available
(1403k kernel code, 4436k reserved, 403k data, 152k init, 0k highmem)
Only 1.5 megs of code, 0.5 megs of data!
