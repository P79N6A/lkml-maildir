I don't think so - GPL doesn't restrict the _use_, only the distribution.
I.e. I'd be breaking law by merely _using_ the epic100 driver, as the
operating system (my experimental Linux-based system) isn't licensed
under GPL - in fact, it isn't licensed under any license, as I don't
distribute it at all.
