Subject: System Hangs With Initio 9x00, 2.2.13, HP 6020i

Well, after several weeks of searching newsgroups and mailing list
archives, hacking, and slashing, I still cannot get my shiny new Iwill
SIDE 2935UW controller to work properly with linux. My problem is that
when I have my HP 6020i cd burner attached to the chain, the system
freezes upon device detection.
The same drive works with my crusty old Adaptec 152x card, with the same
other devices on the chain, and in the same order. On the Iwill/Initio
card, everything works fine under Windows 95 OSR2 (can access files and
write a cd), but linux will not work with the drive attached.
When I have all of the devices attached, the screen output of modprobe
initio looks like this:
i91u: PCI Base=0xA400, IRQ=11, BIOS=0xFF000, SCSI ID=7
i91u: Reset SCSI Bus ...
(picks it's butt for a few seconds, then... )
scsi0 : Initio INI-9X00U/UW SCSI device driver; Revision: 1.03g
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: TOSHIBA   Model: CD-ROM XM-6401TA  Rev: 1009
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 2, lun 0
  Vendor: IOMEGA    Model: ZIP 100 PLUS      Rev: J.66
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi removable disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 5, lun 0
...and then the system locks. No numlock lights, no magic sysrq. I have
to powercycle and wait for the fsck. Note that the Burner is set as ID
4, but doesn't show up in the list.
However, when the burner is disconnected from the chain, everything else
is detected and the system runs fine, although I did have a wierd
problem with the Toshiba CD-ROM garbling data that was solved by a
reboot.
I have attempted to isolate the problem by doing the following: 
	played with the termination on the drive and on the card itself,
	order of devices on the chain, 
	changed scsi IDs,
	Async transfer mode,
	Removed all other devices on the chain,
	removed all other cards in the system other than the video card,
	played "Musical PCI slots" to see if another pci slot will make the
sucker work,
	recompiled the kernel with different PCI options (buggy bridge or
whatever),
	compiled the drivers into the kernel instead of using them as a module,
	tried a Uni-processor kernel
	played with the probe all LUNs option,
	tried disabling vendor-specific extensions.
However, none of these efforts got me anywhere. The fact that everything
works fine under (gasp!!) windows leads me to believe that it is
something with the kernel drivers.
My system is:
	ABIT BP-6 Dual Celerey 400 (not currently overclocked), 128MB RAM
	Matrox Mystique rev.2 PCI 4MB video card (too po' to get AGP)
	Creative Voodoo2 card
	3COM 3c905B NIC
	Hoontech 4DwaveNX
	and of course, the offending IWILL SIDE 2935UW
	Linux Mandrake 6.1 with random cooker updates
	2.2.13 full (not the -devel that ships with mandrake 6.1)
	Scsi support, verbose error messages, cd-rom and disk support as
modules
	Scsi logging facility enabled, but don't know how to use
The Scsi chain has the following attached, in the order listed:
internal 50 pin:
	Toshiba CD-ROM XM-6401TA on ID #2
	HP SureStore 6020i on ID #4
external 50 pin:
	Iomega Zip 100 Plus on ID #5
Please let me know if you need any more information. I have basic C/C++
skills, but know nothing about device drivers.
Thanks.
