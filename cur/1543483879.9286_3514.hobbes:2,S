   In 2.1/2.2 kernels, both incoming and outgoing packets are sent through the
routing engine. Therefore, for a interface to function correctly, there must be
multiple routes set up -- an outgoing route, a local route for its address and
a broadcast route.
   By assigning an address to the an interface, you just tell the kernel to add
a local route to this interface. Local routes without interface addresses or
interface addresses without local routes are semantically incorrect.
   By attaching a network to the interface (i.e, by specifying a non-trivial
netmask), you tell the kernel to add an outgoing network route and also a
broadcast route through the interface.  Again, attached networks without routes
or vice versa are semantical nonsense.
				Have a nice fortnight
