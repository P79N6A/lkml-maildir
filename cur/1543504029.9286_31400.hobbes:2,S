I just tried the 2.3.11 kernel. The new kernel is slightly faster
(67 seconds instead of 69 seconds) and it uses less CPU time (37% vs. 45%)
However 37% is still a very high CPU utilization.

Using mmap on the linux2.3.11 kernel takes now 105 seconds, which is
still slower than doing read system calls in separate threads.
However overall CPU utilization is lower (around 7%) using mmap.
So is there an easy way to make mmap as fast as read (in terms of
wall clock time).
