What made you think this will work?!

You'd have to write it. Grep for register_console for starters.
But I do not advise it, see below.

If oops happens with interrupts closed, forget about it.
USB needs interrupts to work. This is one of the reasons nobody
bothered to implement console over USB serial.
You will have a better chance using Ingo's netconsole, if a patch
for your Ethernet driver exists.
