That's the problem; I haven't been able to reproduce it yet on a "normal"
machine... I'm beginning to think it was a change to 2.4.9 that had some
unexpected side-effect in 2.4.19, though that doesn't really sit well with
me either.  I've been wracking my brain over this for days now, and
nothing's making any sense... I even tried applying different patches from
Andrea and Rik to change the VM behavior (since that was one of the biggest
changes between 2.4.9 and 19), but nothing's made a bit of difference.
Sorry, I'm just a bit frustrated.
