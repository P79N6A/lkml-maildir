Sure.  Try 'tar czf nameofarchive.tar.gz /path/to-dir-to-be-backed-up'
Or, from the runtar log from this morning, and this is all one line:
runtar.20070408022016.debug:running: /bin/tar: 'gtar' '--create' '--file' '-' '--directory' '/usr/dlds-rpms' '--one-file-system' '--listed-incremental' '/usr/local/var/amanda/gnutar-lists/coyote_usr_dlds-rpms_1.new' '--sparse' '--ignore-failed-read' '--totals' '--exclude-from' '/tmp/amanda/sendbackup._usr_dlds-rpms.20070408022016.exclude' '.'
and amanda will if requested, pipe that output through a |gzip -best, and 
its this process that brings the machine to the table begging for scraps 
like a puppy.  Tar by itself can be felt but isn't bad.
Even without the -best switch in effect, I'm sure you'll see the machine 
slow considerably.
Please don't try to call amanda an unusual load as amanda itself is 
nothing but an intelligent manager, constructing the command lines passed 
to tar or dump, and gzip, which do the real work.  Amdump, the manager my 
scripts wrap around, and my scripts themselves, will not use more 
than .01% of the cpu when averaged over the whole backup session.
