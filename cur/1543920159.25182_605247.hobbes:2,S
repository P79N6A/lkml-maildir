git stores to my best knowledge only a single author.
Infrequently we need a list but then people have solved it putting
relevant people in s-o-b and by give credit in changelog.
This is IMHO good enugh.

With the current definition you need to supply BOTH a from: and a s-o-b.
I usually request a s-o-b when it is missing no matter what other content 
is present in the changelog.

I did not realise that "concensus" in this context refered to both the
one that give the "Acked-by" and the author.
Viewing it this way I agree with the intent and the text.
