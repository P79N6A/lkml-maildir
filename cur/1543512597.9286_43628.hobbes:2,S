And spinlock being released in the ->swapout() is outright ugly. OK, so
we are adding to mm_struct a new semaphore (vma_sem) and getting it around
the places where the list is modified + in the swapper (for scanning). In
normal situation it will never give us contention - everyone except
swapper uses it with mmap_sem already held. Are there any objections
against it? If it's OK I'll go ahead and do it. Comments?
