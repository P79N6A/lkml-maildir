snprintf is always a good idea to be using.

Lots of different devices do not have irq, io, and dma assigned to them
(like every USB device).  These values should be on a per-bus type (i.e.
most pci devices _do_ have those types of values.

Yes it is a good place to put them, as almost every /proc file that does
not deal with processes will eventually be moving to this fs.
