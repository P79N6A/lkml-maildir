I don't understand.  I thought we were talking about the 'ready to
run queue' or whatever it is called on Linux?  On our large sun
boxes, we have 400-600 users logged in, but the load average is
just a 'couple'.  On OS/390, we have hundreds of 'processes' - TCBs
actually, but not many are actually waiting for CPU.  Just a
