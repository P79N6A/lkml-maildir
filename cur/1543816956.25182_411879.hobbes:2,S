As seen from the low level sata driver, there isn't much interface to
change. Basically you just want to signal a higher queueing depth, which
will enable the SCSI layer to queue a higher number of ios at any time.
The rest is up to you, how you actually talk to the hardware. Then
there's error handling, I don't think much will change there after
Tejuns merge either.
So if you started off the 'ncq' branch in the block repo, you should be
able to pretty much cary your sata_mv changes straight over. Any change
needed would be to accomodate other libata changes, not ncq.
