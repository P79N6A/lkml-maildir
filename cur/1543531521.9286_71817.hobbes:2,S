In a way yes.  However, it looks to me like ALL hard dirves over 32 GB do
things this way and hide the real LBA value some other place.  My
particular drive is a Maxtor (I have been very happy with their new drives
lately.. very quiet, though run a bit hot at 7200 RPM, no problems
though).
My hard-drive is not really broken though, it is just following a newer
standard.  What is broken is my Award BIOS.  What sucks is that this is
the first computer I have ever had with Award BIOS, and I never really
liked it on anyone elses computer, but bought my motherboard anyway.
Award *HAS* fixed the issue, but Diamond doesn't seem to be supporting the
motherboard anymore (it's a Micronics).  The last BIOS update is from like
april 1999 or something, and I installed it and then reverted back to the
older BIOS, the new one has that stupid graphics screen at startup, and
doesn't support the drive anyway, and is really only needed for PIII
(I have a PII).
