System:
Motherboard = Tyan K8WE
Processor = 2x Opteron 250
Memory = 8GB ECC Registered
On all of the recent release candidates except for
2.6.13-rc2-git2 the kernel panics while booting. These
versions include 2.6.13-rc2-git* (* != 2 ) and 2.6.13-rc3.
I also want to mention that I am using gcc 3.3.5 on debian and
that during compilation there are 3 messages at the end that
say an assertion has failed IE (LD: assertion failed).
It looks like it panics during a mem_cpy but I know its
difficult to tell just by the output.
I get a code: f3 a4 c3 66 66 66 90 66 66 66 90 66 66 66 90 66
The problem appears very reproducable so I can provide more
information upon request.
My .config is avaible upon request.
