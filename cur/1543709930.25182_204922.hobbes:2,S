In fact, it depends on the access pattern.
I would expect the normal usage of fadvise to be:
	for() {
		read() and consume() data in [offset, offset+LEN);
		fadvise(fd, offset, LEN, POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED);
		offset += LEN; /*scanning forward*/
	}
	
In this case, the partial page at `start' should be freed.
Certainly there may be other patterns. 
I wonder the best solution in kernel is to code in favor of the normal case,
and the best(safe and portable) practice in usermode code is to always align
'offset' and 'offset+len' to page boundaries.
And some comment in the manual page of posix_fadvise is recommended.
