Subject: legacy power management to disappear as well?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  even though it's not mentioned in the feature removal file,
Documentation/pm.txt makes it pretty clear that there is some
seriously obsolete content WRT legacy PM.  is that scheduled for
removal any time soon?
  i still have a patch for that lying around somewhere.
