As Andrew pointed out, the mapping struct won't disappear, but
page->mapping may go null.  So the idea is to use barriers to get a
trusted copy of page->mapping, and use the copy everywhere.
This could be completely bogus, and my test tree has a number of other
patches applied.  So, unless someone sees a really obvious bug in this
path, please don't waste brain cells on this one.  
I'll try to reproduce on something a little closer to vanilla if my
patch doesn't fix things.
