The cafe_ccic (OLPC) camera driver uses a tasklet to move frames out of
the DMA buffers in the streaming I/O path.  With this change in place,
I'd worry that the possibility of dropping frames would increase,
especially considering that (1) this is running on OLPC hardware, and 
(2) there is typically a streaming video application running in user
space. 
Obviously some testing is called for here.  I will make an attempt to do
that testing, but the next few weeks involve some insane travel which
will make that hard.  Stay tuned.
Thanks,
jon
