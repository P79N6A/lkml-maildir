This is completely different.  The worst that can happen with checksum
offloading is that the packet is dropped.  That's something people deal
with on a daily basis since the Internet as a whole does not guarantee
the delivery of packets.
On the other hand, /dev/random is something that has always promised
to deliver random numbers that are totally unpredictable.  People out
there *depend* on this.
If that assumption is violated the result could be catastrophic.
That's why it's OK to have hardware RNG spit out unverified numbers
in /dev/hw_random, but it's absolutely unaccpetable for the same
numbers to add entropy to /dev/random without verification.
