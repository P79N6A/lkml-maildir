Well, either way.
rpm2cpio /lnk/103/i586/kernel-default-2.6.22.5-31.i586.rpm [...] grep
DEBUG_INFO ./boot/config-2.6.22.5-31-default
says =y
vs
rpm2cpio /lnk/103/src/kernel-default-2.6.22.5-31.src.rpm [...]
tar -xf config.tar.bz2 [...] grep DEBUG_INFO ./config/i386/default
says =n.
Anyway, it's that option that causes the kernel to be built with -g
and m-i-t does not gracefully handle all that debug info yet.
If /lib is 800 MB, well, expect some serious swapping. Or just
compile without it. Or if you are lazy, find /lib/modules -type f
-iname '*.ko' -print0 | xargs -0 strip -g && depmod. :-)
