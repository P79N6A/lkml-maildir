As it is in 2.5.22 make bzImage compares to make installable in kbuild-2.5.
What about combining best of both worlds?
Let
make bzImage	-> Build bzImage
make modules	-> Build modules
And the new member of the family:
make kernel	-> Build selected binary and modules.
So "make kernel" is similar to kbuild-2.5 "make installable" a name 
that I dislike. Obviously "make kernel" requires support for selecting
the appropriate binary utilising make *config.
That would solve your concerns about the semantics - or?

"make all" I dislike.
"make all" is for me everything that can be maked, including doc's etc.
make with no argument should in my opinion be equal to "make kernel" -
so we agree there.

My prediction is that the new behaviour may result in more errors being
corrected, due to the incentitive to do it. Today you ignore it
and hardly cannot spot it in all the noise generated during the build
process.
By the way - anyone having feedback on the "make KBUILD_VERBOSE=0"
mode. Why not make it default?
