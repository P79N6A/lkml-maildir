After seeing all that many tools for kernel config, I always wanted to ask
this.
There is something (as an 'external' viewer) I never understood.
Why nobody has taken the 'obvious' way ?
- Perl is much more extended that python and better? than sh for CML.
- Perl has perl-Curses (for menuconfig)
- Perl has perl-GTK (for xconfig) (so you geet rid of tcl/tk)
Reasons ?
