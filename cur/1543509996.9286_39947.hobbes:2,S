I get it on my laptop, with PCMCIA card, no DHCP/pump/whatever. 
(what's pump?) I will occasionally get really backed-up pings, a
flood of replies all at once, with ~1000msec intervals. I'll try to
get a snoop from another host the next time I see it. usually,
though, the pings are 1000msec + what it should really be, not just
"1000msec".
Even stranger is to see pings from laptop getting 1000+msec, and in
an ssh-ed window to the other system, see sub-msec pings to the
laptop...
