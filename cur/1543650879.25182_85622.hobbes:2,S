Andrew, that's not necessarily a _good_ feature. 
Journaling is _not_ a great idea.  There are other approaches to
handling atomicity than journaling, like phase trees, that give
equivalent atomicity guarantees without having to write out extra stuff,
or even impose a very strict ordering between data and meta-data.
I didn't read the reiser papers yet, but from Hans' description it
sounds like reiser4 gives all the guarantees ext3 does with ordered
writes, _and_ they get good performance. 
(In fact, from the description it sounds like it gives _more_ guarantees
than even ext3 with ordered writes, in that it gives transactional
behaviour for arbitrary writes. Maybe I should read the paper).
