Clearly, I'm being too clever, and too conservative, belt-n-suspenders.  
I was actually expecting that there might be objections, cause the usage
isn't 'typical' :)
The call sets a global var.  I figured that it would be best to just go 
ahead and initialize it early, rather than hoping it all works at our
moment of 'dire need'.   Removing this call shouldn't affect operation,
except during some bizarro failure situation which can only be imagined
after some creative thinking.
