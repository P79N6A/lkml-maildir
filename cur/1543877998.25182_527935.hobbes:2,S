This won't work I believe.
There are cases that use smaller sense buffers than the minimum
specified by the SCSI layer.
One example is that do_sr_ioctl() stuff when the cgc passed
in has a sense buffer.  That will only be as large as a
"struct request_sense".
I'm pretty sure that's one of the reasons why we cons up a local sense
buffer in this EH code.
So we could walk past the end of that and corrupt memory with
your patch.
