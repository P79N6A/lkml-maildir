Our ia64 server's USB/e100 device uses 32bit-PCI, so sometimes OOM happens on DMA zone.
(ia64's ZONE_DMA is 0-4G area.)
But very sorry....I was confused.
I looked the issue above again and found ZONE_NORMAL/x86 was exhausted.
This was interesiting incident,
Constructing DB on 4Gb system has no problem.
Constructing DB on 8Gb system always causes OOM.
I asked the users to change DB's parameter. (this happened on RHEL4/linux-2.6.9 series)

Ah, maybe we can use it on RHEL5. We'll test it. thank you.
