While true, this isn't such a bad problem.  A language really sucks when
it tries to disallow something useful.  Back in university I was forced
to write system software in pascal.  Simple pointer arithmetic became a
5-line piece of code.
Imo the main advantage of C is simply that it doesn't get in the way.

But this is not to say that the main benefit of Linux and other GPL
software is lower-cost. Control is the main benefit--cost is secondary.
