Ok, let me start out by saying that at this point in the development cycle 
(ie trying to get 2.6.21 out some day), I can't really find it in myself 
to care all that deeply about people doing something quote _that_ fairly 
heinous ;)

Yeah, they seem to want 256MB.

We should be sizing the bridge regions by how much space the devices 
behind the bridges actually need, BUT I can guess at two problems:
 - On PC's, we generally trust any BIOS setup. If the bridge has been 
   initialized to some value that seems half-way valid we generally leave 
   it there. Moving things around tends to cause a lot  more problems than 
   it fixes.
 - we normally do *not* try to assign ROM resources at all, because a 
   number of video cards in particular do some really strange stuff with 
   the ROMS, like share the decoders for the ROM's and the other PCI 
   resources!
IOW, I think that what happens is that the BIOS has set it up to have a 
32MB window, and since the kernel doesn't think there is anything wrong 
with that, it leaves it well enough alone.
You could try adding "pci=rom" to the kernel command line, which should 
make the kernel try to assign space for the roms too.
I think we used to *never* assign PCI bus resources on x86, but that thing 
got fixed some time ago. Now I think we only re-assign them if they were 
unassigned *or* if the assignment wasn't working before. But I'm not 100% 
sure about that second part... It's been working so well that I don't 
think we've had a lot of problems with resource assignment lately, and 
I've paged it all out of my brain.
Ivan, can you remind my tired old brain?
