As recently reported, Estonian umlauts have the same problem.
The solutions seems to be to add "-m trivial" to your setfont command
parameters. This is needed because the unimap semantics have changed in
2.1. When the font loading doesn't provide a new unimap the unimap is
not flushed as is was earlier. At least it seems to be the cause.
The hardcoded ISO-8859-1 table in linux console code _REALLY HURTS_
because there is no convenient way to use other code pages.
