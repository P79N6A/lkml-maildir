577545
(one nights worth 4 am till 4 pm)
The machine was still running, as i used strobe to check the tcp ports
and the log's showed the strobes, however i couldn't get access to the
system to see if there was a particular process causing the problem.
since then i increased the numbers in /proc
Is the inodes in quota the same as this?  if so is that how I prevent
users from using to many?  the kernel is 2.0.36 runing on a p ii 333 256
meg ram and a udma hd runing arround 254 process's on avg (mainly eggdrops
and ftp process's)  and a couple of ircd's.     Could it be a inode leak
like in 2.2.* ?
thnx
