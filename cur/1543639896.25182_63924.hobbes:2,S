Architecture specific and for RAM quite often not supported at all. You
can use ioremap_nocache on ram in theory but that doesn't actually work
on most processors, will MCE on the PPro and needs some work on Athlon
XP/MP
K6/K5 don't support it at all from memory.
If your hardware is sane it will already be doing cache line size bursts
and MWI.
