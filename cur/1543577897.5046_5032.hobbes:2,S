Which happens to be remarkably ugly. And it will not get better tomoorow...
I _really_ don't think that this barfbag should make its way into the
kernel API. Some parts of information make sense. Some don't. API is...
well, "int name" with a bunch of constatnts is a dead giveaway in itself.
If anything, we might want a mount-ID created upon mount(2) and never
reused + pseudo-fs a-la /proc that would give access to per-mount data.
That might be more or less reasonable, but that would also require
returning such ID from stat()...
