I don't see this in the parts of the kernel your patch changes, I will
have to look a little more and see if this is really true.  If it
is you probably should append ULL to the flag constants.

The type of addresses for resources will always be equal or larger
than the resources they actually represent.  Until someone modifies
the pcibios_xxxx code to handle 64bit BARs it should only be
truncation of zeros and thus safe.  
I will see if I can scrutinize this carefully, and try it in the next
little while.  For now I am placing it on the back burner and going
to bed.  It looks like a good start though.
