Keep most of this on the host, offload only performance path like the 
Alacritech TOE.

Intel Clusters and Network Storage Volume Platforms Lab reported that it 
takes about 1MHz to process 1Mbps on a PIII.  Using this rule of thumb (they 
showed it scaling from 400MHz to 800MHz) it would take 10GHz to process 
10Mbps.  Well you might say "what about multi-processers?"  This would be 
good for people that have multi-processors, but there is a large segment of 
embedded processors that are not going have SMP, or be at 10GHz anytime 
soon.  Besides that processing interrupts does not scale across MPs 
liniarly.  The truth is that communication speeds are outpacing processor 
speeds at this time.
