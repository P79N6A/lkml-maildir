(By monotonic time, I presume you mean monotonic real time.)  Yes, I
suppose you could, but I don't think that's terribly useful.   I think
work_time is probably most naturally measured in cpu clock cycles rather
than an actual time unit.  You could convert it to ns, but I don't see
the point.
I know its a term in general use, but I don't think the term "stolen
time" is all that useful, particularly when we're talking about a more
general notion of cpu work contributing to the progress of process
execution.  In the cpufreq case, time isn't "stolen" per se.
(I guess I don't like the term stolen time because you don't refer to
time spent on other processes as being stolen from your process: its
just processor time being distributed.)

Be specific.  What other uses are there?

I guess we could do something for that.  Would we account non-full-speed
cpus to it?  Maybe?
How is cpustat->steal used?  How does it get out to usermode?

I think the important part is that sched_clock() be used to actually
compute how much time each process gets.  The fact that a time quantum
gets stolen is less important.  Or do you mean something else?

Yes.  In the same way that clock modulation gates the cpu clock, the
hypervisor effectively gates the clock by giving time to other vcpus.

Yes, that's my thought.

It seems to me like a nice opportunity to solve two problems with one
mechanism.
