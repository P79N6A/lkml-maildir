I am fully aware of djprobes limitations towards fully preemptible kernel (and
around branches instructions ? I don't remember if they solved this one). Oh,
yes, and if a trap happen to come at the wrong spot, then the thread gets
scheduled out... well, it cannot be applied everywhere, eh ?

This count includes the inline trace functions definitions.

1 - This counts per architecture trace points. It quickly adds up considering
that we support ARM, MIPS, i386, powerpc, ppc and x86_64.
2 - It also counts some experimental trace points that I do not want to submit.
3 - Most of these are instrumentation of the traps handlers, which is
conceptually only one event.

I plan to rework the instrumentation patches before submitting them to LKML,
don't worry. I just hasn't been my focus until now. Too bad that you take those
as arguments.
