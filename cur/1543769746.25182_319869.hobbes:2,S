I'll be delving deeper into this thread soon, but I'm seeing similar
strangeness
on a Athlon64 (rated:3G+ real:2009MHz clock), 2.6.11-r8 (gentoo), MSI
K8N Neo Platinum.
ntp syncs time, then I start a couple of compiles, and I see ntp
losing track of time, big jitter etc. (and the one time source is in
on the local LAN syncing to the same remote servers). openntp I
noticed it also.
What I have noticed in my dmesg output is that I see "lost timer ticks
CPU Frequency change?" messages very early in the boot up.

I've seen this for about a week or three, and somehow I believe it
wasn't a problem before 2.6.11.
