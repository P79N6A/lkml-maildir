That will likely trigger anytime a hard nfs/cifs mount loses its
server for 120s. To make this work you would need a new 
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE_EXTERNAL_EVENT or similar and mark
all the places which depend on those.
I've also seen kernel modules that use semaphores like wait queues
While that gives a little funny results (high load average) it worked 
so far, until this patch.
