  Hello.
  So I've been thinking about fixes in quota (and also writing some parts).
I think I thought of a bit easier implementation of featureas Al suggested. So:
  * i_blocks is updated by quota in DQUOT_{ALLOC|FREE}_BLOCK (as a bonus we get
    fix of those unpleasant ext2 preallocation vs. quota bug)
  * all functions updating quota are protected by kernel lock
  * functions dquot_{alloc|free}_{block|inode}, dquot_transfer can block but they
    never block between the place where they get first dquot from inode and place
    where everything is updated
  So we can achieve this by:
  * printing warning message somewhere after we update i_blocks and quota - to achieve
    this I will have to change functions slightly but it's IMO easier than creating
    helper thread for printing
  * we will do write without holding dquot lock - it will just copy dquot to some
    buffer and write that buffer. So that now we have guaranteed that
    when we do dqduplicate() in dquot_{alloc|free}_{block|inode} we know it doesn't
    block
  * make notify_change() call dquot_transfer() and not the other way
  What do you think about it? (to the IO stuff: I still want to move IO to pagecache
but with this solution there's less probability of making stupid mistakes in stable
release)
  I have also two questions:
  Shouldn't we sync inode in ext2_notify_change() when O_SYNC is on?
  I see no serialization between ext2_notify_change()'s on one inode (just kernel lock).
  As it currently doesn't block there's probably no problem but when DQUOT_TRANSFER() is
  called from ext2_notify_change() it's not true any more. So what's the right lock
  to serialize on (serialization is needed at least for DQUOT_TRANSFER() itself...)?
  Any objections against inode->i_sem?
