Subject: [PATCH] [mmc] [tifm] Reduces delay in card insert/removal
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

First, I tried to replace 'mdelay' with 'msleep' and put it after
'unlock'. It gives a certain oops.
With the delay of 50 msec driver remains stable. It has something
to do with hardware initialization, so this value should not be
affected by CPU speed. I hope so.
