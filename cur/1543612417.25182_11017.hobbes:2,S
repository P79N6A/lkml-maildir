The usual difference is if you have a pthreads capable C library
or not. For newer glibc bonnie++ should definitely use 
putc_unlocked(); otherwise it'll eat lock overhead for each character
to take the FILE lock. 
As far as I can see bonnie++ doesn't use putc_unlocked, but putc.
With libc5 it likely would magically get a lot faster @)
