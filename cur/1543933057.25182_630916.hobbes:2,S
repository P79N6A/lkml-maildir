Well from where I come from, full stops are only used for complete
sentences.  For example,
http://www.ballarat.edu.au/aasp/student/learning_support/generalguide/ch01s05s02.shtml
As to what is a complete sentence, that is debatable.  However,
typically it would include a subject and a predicate.  By this
rule the following line is not a complete sentence:
	[XFS] Initialise current offset in xfs_file_readdir correctly
The reason is that it lacks a subject.
Of course I would completely agree that some kernel messages
are complete sentences and should have a full stop.  However,
it is not clear to me that this is the case for all or even
most kernel printk messages.
Cheers,
