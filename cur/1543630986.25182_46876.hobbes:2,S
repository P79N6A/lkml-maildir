How much are you swapping in your workload? (as said the fast paths are
hurted a little so it's expected that it's almost as fast as mainline
with a kernel compile, similar to the fact we also add anon pages to the
lru list). I think you're only exercising the fast paths in your
workload, not the memory balancing that is the whole point of the change.
