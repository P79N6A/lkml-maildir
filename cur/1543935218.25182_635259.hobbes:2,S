This will actually stop being the same soon with GB pages which
are only supported on 64bit.

This all seems hardly 64bit specific (except for THREAD_ORDER
but you can probably handle that in Kconfig or just get rid
of it for 32bit)

Also not 64bit specific

I originally added the PHYSICAL_MASK stuff to deal with masking off NX,
but I must admit it wasn't the best idea I ever had. It would be probably
better to just get rid of it and always mask off the high reserved flags bit
explicitely. If you make that 0 then there should be no special
case for PAE.
