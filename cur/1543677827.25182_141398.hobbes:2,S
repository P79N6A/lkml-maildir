With 2.5.72, my laptop with a Cardbus 3c575 NIC and RH9 user-space
(hotplug-2002_04_01-17 and kernel-pcmcia-cs-3.1.31-13) no longer
brings eth0 up automatically on insertion of the NIC. cardmgr
_is_ running. A manual ifup eth0 brings it up however.
This all worked fine up to 2.5.71.
The only relevant diff in the dmesg logs is:
--- dmesg-2.5.71	2003-06-18 14:17:44.000000000 +0200
+++ dmesg-2.5.72	2003-06-18 14:17:52.000000000 +0200

 05:00.0: 3Com PCI 3c575 Boomerang CardBus at 0x1800. Vers LK1.1.19
 PCI: Setting latency timer of device 05:00.0 to 64
 eth0: Dropping NETIF_F_SG since no checksum feature.
-eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII #0 link partner capability of 01e1.
2.5.72 discovers the device, the 100Mbps link led on the NIC
lights up, but nothing further happens.
Any ideas?
