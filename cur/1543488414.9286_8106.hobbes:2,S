In the course of making and testing some mods to the kernel (2.2.2 if it
matters) I need to midfy the scheduler some.  I need it to test if a
process meets a criterion, and if not, see if it can reschedule it on a
different CPU (it only applies to SMP).
The end goal will be (essentially, for testing purposes right now) a CPU (1
of 2) that is not allowed to schedule any process.
I initially thought I could just make goodness() return -1000 if my
criterion was not met.  It makes sense to me - bad criteria, don't
schedule.  However when I do this, the whole system locks up as soon as I
initiate the processor restriction.  
how can I do this?
