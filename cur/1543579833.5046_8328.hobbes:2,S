If you set a SNIC (Serial Network Interface Chip) to loop-back, the
signal doesn't come in or go out the cable! In fact, initialization
procedures often require that the SNIC be put into loop-back so that
nothing is being received during the initialization process.
You just need another card for the single-machine loop-back testing
that you describe. FYI, you can get an idea of the underlying network
code speed by using the echo and sink port over lo. This uses all
the IP layers, but bypasses the Ethernet hardware.
