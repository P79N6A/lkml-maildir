After placing my Netgear 302t NICs into my SS50 P-IV (1.8Ghz)
machine, they seem to work fine.  (They had various problems in
my AMD machines, but that could all just be coincidence and other,
non-related, problems)
My test-bed has two of these NICs connected to each other via
a cross-over cable.  Both NICs are in the same machine...
Here are some performance numbers I see:
tcp/ip send + receive in user-space:
   112Mbps on each port (does not count any packet over-head,
     and my generator/receiver is not the fastest thing around)
pktgen (kernel pkt generator module):
   60-byte packets, sending 1kpps in one direction, and maximum possible
   in the other.  Was able to generate 122,000 packets-per-second.
   (A tulip 10/100 NIC can do 140kpps in this configuration)
   Average Latency: 22 micro-seconds.
   0 dropped packets over 10+ minute run.
   1514-byte packets, sending 1kpps in one direction, max possible in
   the other.  25.8kpps (310Mbps) in the fast direction.
   Average Latency:  17 miliseconds (127 micro-seconds for the 1kpps direction)
   2000 dropped pkts, 5.8 million sent during this test.
So, not too bad, probably the 32/33 PCI bus is most of the bottle-neck.
The good part is, no errors or other strangnesses were seen with the driver.
Enjoy,
Ben
