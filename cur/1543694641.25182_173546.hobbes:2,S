Hi,
I've been using two Promise PDC20269 cards for almost a year now in my system.  
The cards are U133, but when the kernel boots up, I see the message that all 
the drives are operating in pio mode.  All the drives are U133 drives, and 
they are shown as operating in DMA mode when I put them on another 
controller.
I've noticed this deficiency with vanilla linux-2.4.19 through linux-2.4.21, 
linux-2.4.22-ac4 as well as 2.6.0-test6-mm4...
Is there a patch to the 2.4 kernels availible to enable this support?  Is this 
problem being addressed?  Is there any way I can help out?
Thanks,
Jeremy
