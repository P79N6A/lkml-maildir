cd->offset is 0xefd78000, which is the start of a, presumably unused, page.
Yes... this patch should fix it.
Thanks for the report.

===============================================================
Fix NFSD oops in readdir.
If a single readdir entry needs to be split over two pages in
the reply, we first encode it into a new page, and then copy the
bits into place.  When we do this relocation, we have to modify
the "offset" pointer to be either in the first or the second page,
as appropriate.
If the pointer should be at the start of the second page, it is currently
put past the end of the first page.
Note that as the offset and whole response is known to be 4byte-aligned,
the offset pointer will never be split over two pages.
