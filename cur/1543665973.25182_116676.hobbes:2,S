Hi Alan,
No surprise, probably, but I'm still getting the kernel oops when
I use swapoff on any partition which is not already mounted as a
swap partition (i.e. what 'swapoff -a' attempts to do.)
I've already tried using very conservative CFLAGS for compiling
both the kernel and util-linux with no improvement.
Any further information I can supply to help fix this?  Any
other tricks I can try?
