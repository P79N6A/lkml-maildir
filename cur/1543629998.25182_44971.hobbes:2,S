Ben, Trond,
Ugh.  It's been a bad week in general.  Anyway, yes, you're right, the 0.17
upgrade did the trick - I had actually tried that, but had accidentally
re-applied the rpc_tweaks dif which knocked the performance down again. 
Backing out that patch, updating to v 0.17 of the ns83820 driver and all is
well, again.  
So, it's back in Trond's court, with the rpc_tweaks causing the slow
read/write over NFS, problem.
Trond, if all I want is 32k block transfers from that dif, can I just apply
the following, or is there more to it:
diff -u --recursive --new-file
linux-2.4.18-svc_tcp/include/linux/nfsd/const.h
linux-2.4.18-rpc_cong/include/linux/nfsd/const.h
