  Does this run correctly for UP? And is this the right version of
setiathome for this CPU. Not using SSE7, 4Dthen, or some other
proprietary FP method? And until it is proven to work with the MP part,
should it ever actually be shipped instead of advertized, I wouldn't be
totally sure about XP or kernel being at fault, or even RAM problems
under load, etc.
