/dev/hdc:
ATAPI CD-ROM, with removable media
         Model Number:       LITE-ON LTR-16102B
         Serial Number:
         Firmware Revision:  OS0K
Standards:
         Used: ATAPI for CD-ROMs, SFF-8020i, r2.5
         Supported: CD-ROM ATAPI-2
Configuration:
         DRQ response: 50us.
         Packet size: 12 bytes
Capabilities:
         LBA, IORDY(cannot be disabled)
         DMA: mdma0 mdma1 *mdma2
              Cycle time: min=120ns recommended=120ns
         PIO: pio0 pio1 pio2 pio3 pio4
              Cycle time: no flow control=227ns  IORDY flow control=120ns
For me it looks as though multiword dma 2 is being used, isnt it?
Another question: When doing dmesg, I see this:
...
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [APCK] (IRQs 20 21 22)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [APCS] (IRQs *23)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [APCL] (IRQs 20 21 22)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [APCM] (IRQs 20 21 22)

ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [APCZ] (IRQs 20 21 22)
Linux Plug and Play Support v0.97 (c) Adam Belay
SCSI subsystem initialized

ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LSMB] enabled at IRQ 10
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LUBA] enabled at IRQ 11

ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LUB2] enabled at IRQ 10
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LMAC] enabled at IRQ 10
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LAPU] enabled at IRQ 10
...
Is it normal that SCSI subsystem gets init'ed, even though nothing of it 
is activated in the kernel?
