Update: 2.5.75 is OK, so the problem was introduced in 2.6.0-test1.
I have not yet verified it, but I suspect that the addition of the
mntget() call is the cause:
==> fs/namespace.c <==
+/*
+ * Now, lookup_mnt increments the ref count before returning
+ * the vfsmount struct.
+ */
 struct vfsmount *lookup_mnt(struct vfsmount *mnt, struct dentry *dentry)
 {
 	struct list_head * head = mount_hashtable + hash(mnt, dentry);
 	struct list_head * tmp = head;
-	struct vfsmount *p;
+	struct vfsmount *p, *found = NULL;
 
+	spin_lock(&vfsmount_lock);
 	for (;;) {
 		tmp = tmp->next;
 		p = NULL;
 		if (tmp == head)
 			break;
 		p = list_entry(tmp, struct vfsmount, mnt_hash);
-		if (p->mnt_parent == mnt && p->mnt_mountpoint == dentry)
+		if (p->mnt_parent == mnt && p->mnt_mountpoint == dentry) {
+			found = mntget(p);
 			break;
+		}
 	}
-	return p;
+	spin_unlock(&vfsmount_lock);
+	return found;
 }
