Like I said, fixing the order of kcalloc parameters with a follow-up
patch to use kzalloc is just plain stupid. You can ignore my review
comments all you want, but don't expect that bit to be merged. So, for
the record: NAK for that bit of the patch, it should be converted to
kzalloc instead. Thanks.
