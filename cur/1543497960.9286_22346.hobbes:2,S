   Yes. Each architecture should register its own onboard devices when
initializing the resource manager.

   In such cases, the driver needs to propagate the unplug information
to all devices connected to it before it uninitializes itself.

   Yes, but the decisions on what resources should be assigned to what
devices should be definitely left to userspace programs as they are very
complex and it's wise to make them overridable by some config file.

   Yes, but I'm not sure about the details.
   By the way, I remember that some time ago you were talking about I2O
needing some special resource allocation -- can you tell me more about
these issues, please?

   :-(( Until now I didn't know about any such architecture. I'm afraid that
any solution to this problem will be ugly. For accessing the devices in the
kernel we can make ioremap() a bus-dependent function, but it does solve
neither resource management issues nor user-level access via /dev/mem.
   I hope I'll hear the opinion of people maintaining the architectures where
this appears soon.

   Ok.

   I don't like that, too, but currently on some architectures readl() at al.
swaps bytes _always_, but many devices are able to switch their MMIO
to big endian, so that the driver can avoid swaps at all. I'm only not sure
whether the complexity of making use of this is adequate to the speed gain.
				Have a nice fortnight
