No, I submitted a patch for that that went into 2.6.13. In
initrd/initramfs, load the controller modules and then echo the
major:minor of the suspend device into /sys/power/resume. As long as
this is done before any filesystems are mounted, it works fine.
(Yes, it gives you the ability to shoot yourself in the foot, but then
so does the rest of the kernel...)
