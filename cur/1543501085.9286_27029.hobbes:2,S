yepp. In fact it was only a single page. They wanted to check if the
servers were capable of saturating (?correct english?) a 100Mbit line,
then later, if this was still true for 2 100Mbit lines.
Obviously NT has no problems 'saturating' up to four (see Mindcraft; or
even more?) NICs, when the service requested is trivial. But then Linux
can't and, as other people in other threads pointed out, that should be
looked at. Besides giving M$ a sure win in benchmarks, current and
forthcoming ones, it does not fit the target of improving scalability
(when not restricted to SMP, but including multiple-I/O).
