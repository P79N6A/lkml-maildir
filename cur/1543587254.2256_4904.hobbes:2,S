> This seems to happen on my system too but I have and IDE tape:
Seems uncurrelated. I'm trying this:
# cd ~archive; tar cvzf /dev/tapes/tape0 # using devfs on rewinding dev
(some 600MB of stuff...)
where ~archive is on a SCSI drive (ext2 fs on LVM volume if can help)
# tar tvzf /dev/tapes/tape0
... some stuff pass correctly...
then gzip give a CRC error (no tape errors in syslog)
tape0 is on scsi0 (2904), the disk is on scsi1 (2940UW). Seems that the
problem is writing, because I get the CRC error always at the same point
