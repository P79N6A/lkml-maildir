I said "there are two ways to handle this".  You snipped the second,

I would consider your approach a variant of the "horrible games with if
statements and temporary variables". (:
Here's an exercise to the reader: reformat drivers/net/Makefile using
John Alford's approach, diff the two, and take a look.  Then come back
and tell me LINK_FIRST -- 0-2 lines in the Makefile depending on your
ordering requirements, plus about five lines in Rules.make (*yes*, it
really is that simple) -- is really uglier.
