Also, besides security implications of stack randomization, there is one 
more aspect that should not be forgotten - stack randomization (even for 
quite small range) could be useful to distribute a pressure on cache 
(which may not be fully associative in all cases), so if everyone runs 
with stack on the same address, it could impose quite noticeable stress on 
some cachelines (those representing stack addresses), while other will 
be idling unused.
I thought that this was the original purpose of the "stack randomization" 
which is shipped for example by RedHat kernels, as the randomization is 
quite small and easy to bruteforce, so it can't serve too much as a buffer 
overflow protection.
