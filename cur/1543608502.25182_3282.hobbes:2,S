Problem is:
there is a lot of HW out there, and we should ALL do stress tests, to have
a wide basis for HWs and test cases.
Basically it is very hard to agree
about a set of stress tests, because we all have different needs, and our
tests are based on our needs. That is a streght, because they tend to be
real life tests.
In my esperience, if some default set of tests comes out, then software
tend to be optimized for this set. And that is badly wrong.
Our disomogeneous tests are a good thing indeed.
For example, with servers with not so mutch memory (128/256 Mbyte RAM
256/512 MByte SWAP) I am interested for interactive uses, because usually
I have 20/50 users connected to them using Xwin (from X session on
localhost and many Xterms), netscape, KDE, a lot of mail software and TeX.
With bigger Iron (sparc64 with some Gbytes of RAM/SWAP) I am mutch more
interested in DB performances and web servers with zope and other
application servers.
My stress test have been developed during those years thinking on my
needs.
Thanx to this test, it was possible to see some VM bugs that was very
difficoult to be seen under other conditions. Then it was easy to work
with AA to fix them, and I have to say, he has been always available and
interested to solve every problem.
Other people will test other cases.
Then it belongs to Linus to see if he is satisfied with reports.
He can just take advantage of actual situation with testers.
This way Linux has a lot of possibility to run well on the most HW
(I am also thinking to alpha, sparc64, mips ecc.), and
with the most cases.
