It should not be so much of a performance bottleneck -- this kind of
operation lends itself naturally to parallelization, since it has few
(if any) dependencies. The only race I can think of off-hand is the
exit() syscall, but I'm sure that's already handled elsewhere (just not
sure of the details) In the end, however, if you believe my previous
email, then you should believe that the copy has to happen in any case.
I don't have any actual data points on-hand. Perhaps someone else does?
