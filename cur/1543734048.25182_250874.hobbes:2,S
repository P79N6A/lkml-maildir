I don't think that "Liar." is an appropriate response. If you sent a 
response, just quote it.
I must say that your attitude towards persons contributing to Linux (of 
which this email is the least of it) has over the years lost Linux 
persons much more talented than yourself. We lost the opportunity to 
have one of DARPAs hot young security researchers contribute to us 
because his experience was that Linux maintainers are a collection of 
assholes hostile to new contributors, and he had too much self respect 
to deal with the likes of you. He was a very nice and talented young 
man. Frankly, I look at Linux, and I see all the reasons why I decided 
not to develop for BSD coming to life in Linux now that Linux is more 
successful than BSD. Inner circle, hostility to newcomers, patch 
acceptance based on whose nose is in whose ass, etc., etc.
