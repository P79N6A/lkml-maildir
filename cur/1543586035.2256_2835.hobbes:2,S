OK, I think I need to modify some other sources to get this fixed.
I changed in agpgart_be.c:
Current version:
----------------
static int __init agp_init(void)
{
        int ret_val;
...
 
Change to:
----------
int __init agp_init(void)
{
        static int ret_val = 0;
        static int woman = 0;
        if (woman) return ret_val;
        woman = 1;
...                                 
Now I can invoke agp_init during i810fb_init and I get Tux!
Thanks to all helping in this matter.
I have no idea if this is the best solution and I do not know what to do to 
get agpgart_be.c changed in the kernel tree.
