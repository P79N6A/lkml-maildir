And how does reiser4 do this without changing the userspace apps?
Most files are written with several write() calls, so even if each call is
atomic, your entire file will not be there.
Also, ext3 could claim the same atomicity if it only updated meta-data on
write() call boundaries, instead of block boundaries.
