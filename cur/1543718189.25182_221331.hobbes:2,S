With Andrew's one-liner backed out (and your patch for reiserfs
left in), I made one successful test on my /usr ext3 fs (which
was created with default block size) and one attempt on my
new 1k block ext3 fs on my second disk.  Unfortunately, that
new fs is too small for this testing, and I got a not enough
space error while doing the first test. I plan on reformatting
the 3.9G reiserfs on my second disk to ext3 with 1k blocks
to try again tonight.
I attempted to run a script to do successive bk pulls/unpulls on
the larger ext3 fs overnight, but ppp kept failing, so I gave up
after turning into a tired pumpkin.
