Maybe you could help me with better comments? IMHO, it would be enough
to warn new timeslices have different meaning, or stop to use this
term at all. (Btw, in -rc8-mm2 I see new sched_slice() function which
seems to return... time.)

But, there is this "something", very similar and very misleading, you
count eg. in check_preempt_curr_fair to find if time is over, and I
think this could be similar enough to what David Schwartz wanted to
use in his idea, and you didn't care to explain why it's so different?
