Sounds good.

Not something to get into in this patch, but it did surprise me too.
I believe __GFP_REPEAT should be avoided, and I don't see justification
for it here (but need to remember not to do a blind virt_to_page on the
result in some places if it might return NULL - which IIRC it actually
can do even if __GFP_REPEAT, when chosen for OOM kill).  But I've a
suspicion it got put in there for some good reason I don't know about.
