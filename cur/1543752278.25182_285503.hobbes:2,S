This has been explained several times already.
When you run a JACK client, the user should not be required to use a
different command sequence depending on whether or not JACK is running
with RT scheduling or not. That's almost more arcane than the current
situation and is a step backwards from even 2.4, where we use
capabilities to allow JACK itself to pass on the ability to use RT
scheduling and memlock to its clients.
