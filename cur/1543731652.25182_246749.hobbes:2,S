I think, based on the last 25 hours of running both memburn and 
setiathome at a -nice 19, and there have been no errors, that I might 
have stumbled onto a fix.
It seems the dram is marked DDR400, so I was trying to run it that 
way.  Unforch, on checking the invoice for the umpteenth time, it 
finally dawned on me that this particular AMD 2800XP is supposedly a 
333mhz FSB chip, and not rated for use with DDR400 memory.  Switching 
the bios setting for the memory to 'auto' from 'spd' seems to effect 
this particular item, and the memory now signs in as DDR333 Dual 
Channel.
And after 25 hours, no errors, nothing unusual in the logs.
I guess I should go paint my face with egg or something...  My 
apologies to those who spent a considerable amount of time and brain 
power auditing code because of my stupidity.
