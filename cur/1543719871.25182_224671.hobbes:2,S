Subject: [PATCH] ppc64 gives up too quickly on hotplugged cpu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi-
On some systems it can take a hotplugged cpu much longer to come up than 
it would at boot.  If the cpu comes up after we've given up on it, it 
tends to die in its first attempt to kmem_cache_alloc (uninitialized 
percpu data, I imagine).
In my experimentation I haven't seen a processor take more than one 
second to become available; the patch waits five seconds just to be safe.
Patch is against 2.6.7-rc2; please apply.
