true enough -- there's no perfect solution, but i'm convinced that
it can certainly be much more intuitive and organized that it is now.
i think that, as it stands now, the kernel configuration process is
the inevitable result of the linux kernel growing so fast and having
so many new features added to it that there simply was never the
time to step back, take a deep breath and clean up what was already
there before marching on.
