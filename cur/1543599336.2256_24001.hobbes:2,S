You forgot to enable NFSv3 support in your 2.4.9 kernel.

In 99.999% of cases this is due to a network configuration
error. Usually it's things like running full-duplex against a
half-duplex capable switch etc.
TCP is less sensitive to this sort of thing than UDP is, so you won't
see it using telnet.
If you can't resolve where the problem lies, try setting rsize and
wsize manually to some smaller value.
