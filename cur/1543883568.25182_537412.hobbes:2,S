While I'm not reading this entire thread for lack of time:
This looks exactly like the kind of bug tracking that Timo Sirainen of
Dovecot fame concocted and talked about on the dovecot-users list,
quote:
| Dovecot BTS
| -----------
|
|The preferred way to report bugs is to send them to dovecot-bugs at
|dovecot.org. The only thing it does is prefix the subject line with [BUG
|#nnn] and forward it to dovecot at dovecot.org.
|
|Now everyone can reply to it just as it was a normal mailing list mail.
|As long the subject contains the "[BUG #nnn]" prefix, it's part of the
|bug.
|
|Existing mailing list threads can also be turned into bugs by replying
|to the thread's root message with To: dovecot-bugs at dovecot.org. This
|again causes the new reply to contain [BUG #nnn] prefix.
|
|Then comes the web part. [...]"      -- quoting Timo Sirainen

Perhaps it's a stripped-down sibling of the Debian BTS without itself
knowing :-) anyways, it's E-Mail centric, low ceremony, devised from the
currently implemented workflow.
I haven't followed its details, portability, shape, state or anything,
but the requirements appear very similar to Linus's -- at least to me
with entirely outside view (I've never used kernel bugzilla), so it
might be a starting point, conceptionally or with some luck even
implementation-wise.
(Yes I know it's going to be tough to obtain all the precioussssssss
bugssssssssssss from bugzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzilla but anyways, if nobody likes
to use it, something will be done and if only neglect...)
