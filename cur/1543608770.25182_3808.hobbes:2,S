I'm still not convinced this is a good idea, but if you are going to
do things inside the NFS client, why don't you instead write a wrapper
function around rpc_call_sync() for fs/nfs/nfs3proc.c. Something like
static int
nfs_rpc_wrapper(struct rpc_clnt *clnt, struct rpc_message *msg, int flags)
{
        sigset_t oldset;
        int res;
        rpc_clnt_sigmask(clnt, &oldset);
        do {
                res = rpc_call_sync(clnt, msg, flags);
                if (result != -EJUKEBOX)
                        break;
                set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
                schedule_timeout(NFS_JUKEBOX_RETRY_TIME);
                res = -ERESTARTSYS;
        } while (!signalled());
        rpc_clnt_sigunmask(clnt, &oldset);
        return res;
}
and then use a couple of '#define's to wrap rpc_call() and
rpc_call_sync() in nfs3_proc_*(). That will take care of all those
synchronous calls in one fell swoop.
You'll still need to take care of asynchronous reads, writes and
unlink, but those are easy. Just do something like
if (task->tk_error == -EJUKEBOX) {
        rpc_delay(task, NFS_JUKEBOX_RETRY_TIMEO);
        rpc_restart_call(task);
        return;
}
in nfs_readpage_result(), nfs_writeback_done(), nfs_commit_done(), and
nfs_async_unlink_done()...
Cheers,
