No, it doesn't, at least not for me. And from a purely theoretical
perspective I don't think such references should be considered bad -
.exit.* should be discarded together with .init.* if unloading is
impossible (built-in or configured off), not before module/kernel
initialization. This is specifically because init code may want to utilize
exit code in case of initialization failure.
