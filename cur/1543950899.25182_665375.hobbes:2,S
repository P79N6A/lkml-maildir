Ugh, that's horrible.  And people wonder why I hate the sysdev code :)
Does it also mean that when we do cleanup sysdev devices, we are freeing
a name that might not have been dynamically allocated?  If so, we need
to fix that as well.
A simple 'strdup' of the class name in sysdev_class_register() should
fix all of this, right?

Yes, that would be great to fix up, but probably unlikly so late in the
release cycle.
How about the patch below, does it work for you? (build tested only)
thanks,
