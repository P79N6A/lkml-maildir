Dammit.  Ok, all better now.  I guess that fruit fly managed to get into
more than just the slot-1 connector.  We can thank Tyan and AMI for not
checking the contents of ESCD nor giving me a way to reset it without
nuking CMOS.
(It would appear ACPI, when re-enabled, powered the RAID controller down.
 That makes it Really Hard (tm) to boot.)
