+          When Y this option provides accounting and allows configuring
+          limits for user's consumption of exhaustible system resources.
+          The most important resource controlled by this patch is unswappable
+          memory (either mlock'ed or used by internal kernel structures and
+          buffers). The main goal of this patch is to protect processes
+          from running short of important resources because of accidental
+          misbehavior of processes or malicious activity aiming to ``kill''
+          the system. It's worth mentioning that resource limits configured
+          by setrlimit(2) do not give an acceptable level of protection
+          because they cover only a small fraction of resources and work on a
+          per-process basis.  Per-process accounting doesn't prevent malicious
+          users from spawning a lot of resource-consuming processes.
