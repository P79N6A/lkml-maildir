Isn't that exactly what the in-kernel one does though? which people were
complaining about (wrt network backend (softirq?) processing)? And some interrupts are much heavier than others, surely?

No, multiple NICs. but if I shove 8 gigabit adaptors in a machine, we need
more than 1 cpu to process it ...

Mmmm. for benchmarking scenarios, maybe ... but I do believe than machines
aren't maxed out all the time. definitely a problem to determine how long
the idle interval is though. Past history might be a clue, but ... yes, not
easy.

In principle either way *could* be arch independant ... though the in-kernel
one certainly isn't right now. 
Is there actually any algorithmic difference between the user-space and
in-kernel ones? or is this just a philosophical debate about user vs kernel
placement of code? ;-)
