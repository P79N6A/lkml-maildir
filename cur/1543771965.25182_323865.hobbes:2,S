bootsect.S isn't used any longer.  see the final changeset comments
for it here:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/related/arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S?nav=index.html
|src/|src/arch|src/arch/i386|src/arch/i386/boot

LDD3 (Linux Device Drivers, 3rd edition) and the in-kernel 'kerneldoc'
comments are the closest to that and the best chance of staying
updated and current.
LDD3 is available at
http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/
or in tree/paper form at (some) bookstores.
| My kernel is 2.6.11.
