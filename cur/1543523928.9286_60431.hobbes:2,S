no.  It has no way of asking the ac97 if data is flowing through it,
so it leaves it on unconditionally.  (and lots of other gunk in the
maestro that just might have to do with that, but may not be
required.  should experiment more :))
>    (b) when the module is auto-unloaded, the CD sound stops?
quite probably :)  so one could get around this by using the 
'use_pm=0' option to ignore power management entirely.  I'll
be sure to mention this in the Doc/* file should i actually
put this stuff into the real driver.
