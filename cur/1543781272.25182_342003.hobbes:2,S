No, it's not correct.  ct_add_countes has to be called from within
write_lock_bh() on ip_conntrack_lock.
So if you keep the ct_add_counters() call where it is and only apply the
rest of your patch (i.e. deferring of ip_conntrack_event_cache() call),
then I think your patch would work.
However, the whole eventcache needs to be audited, it's called from a
number of places.
As Patrick wrote he's working on a solution, I'm not going to intervene
or replicate his work.  As a interim solution I'd suggest disabling
CONFIG_IP_NF_CT_ACCT [which can't be vital anyway, since it was only
added in net-2.6.14 (and thus -mm)].
Cheers,
