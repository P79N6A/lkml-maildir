Or by numbering entries written out, when in flight-recording mode you
wouldn't want to block the kernel.

Yeah - you're right. The misunderstanding is because in both cases
(overwrite and non-overwrite) data is lost, except that in one case you lose
old data, and in the other new data.
It might be a good idea to document this as well.
Btw, I've already uncovered interesting things using relayfs, but I still
don't see the case for having it merged :-)
Thanks for your answers, I think I get it all now.
