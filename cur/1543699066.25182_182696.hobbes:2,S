Hi Bart,
I'd like to have my IDE modularisation patch included in this. See the following link for the details.
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107004921520850&w=2
In the current state of the IDE driver none of the modules can be loaded.
Please let me know if you think that this can be handled in a different way.
    Best regards,
        Gertjan.
