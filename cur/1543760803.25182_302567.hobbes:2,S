OK well that is a good result for you. Thanks for sticking with it.
Unfortunately you'll probably not want to test any patches on your
production system, so the cause of the problem will be difficult to
fix.
I am working on patches which improve HT performance in some
situations though, so with luck they will cure your problems too.
Basically I think SMP "balancing" is too aggressive - and this may
explain why 2.6.10 was worse for you, it had patches to *increase*
the aggressiveness of balancing.
The other thing that worries me is your need for lower_zone_protection.
I think this may be due to unbalanced highmem vs lowmem reclaim. It
would be interesting to know if those patches I sent you improve this.
They certainly improve reclaim balancing for me... but again I guess
you'll be reluctant to do much experimentation :\
Thanks,
Nick
