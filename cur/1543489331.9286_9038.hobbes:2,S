Take it easy, BE folks, LE is better, because i.e. error detection
of network protocols, which are normally BE. If you coders forget to
swap a single short, LE will easily show up (aka. won't work).
It's not a bug, it's a feature.
If Linus had started his project on a Mac, this world would think 
the other way around. (Isn't Transmeta working on a 86xxx clone?)
I feel for you. Linus, because I can imagine, that you can't simply
switch of the brain-inherent byte swapper. But isn't it terrible to
remember the data structures (at least the difference between strings
and more than 8 bit values). If we stick now on LE, I would vote for
redefining the network byte order on the long run...

(who ported some protocol stuff from BE to LE, some time ago)
(knowing now the deficits of C preprocessor macros for that reason)
