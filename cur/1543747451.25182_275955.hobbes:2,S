or if you know the name of the initrd you want to use in place of the regular,
you can use 'e' key to edit the entry you want; just change the name of the
initrd file to the right one. and boot it with 'b' key.
Being able to change the boot configuration at boot time is the very one of my
prefered features GRUB has and lilo does not.

if he knows where the real initrd is, no need to go thru the repair procedure,
editing the boot entries at boot time is possible with the grub.
