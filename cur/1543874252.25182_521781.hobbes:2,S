It was probably me, and I had the opinion that KDE is not as smooth as 
GNOME with RSDL. I haven't had time to measure, but using for daily 
stuff for about an hour each way hasn't changed my opinion. Every once 
in a while KDE will KLUNK to a halt for 200-300ms doing mundane stuff 
like redrawing a page, scrolling, etc. I don't see it with GNOME.
