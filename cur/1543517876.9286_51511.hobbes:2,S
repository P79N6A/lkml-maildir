Hackers and testers are encouraged to download and try the latest
version of my VIA 82Cxxx audio driver, available from
http://gtf.org/garzik/drivers/via82cxxx/
This driver is for the PCI audio chip built onto many popular Via
motherboards.  Version 1.1.1 includes the following updates:
* Now uses the AC97 mixer interface
* /proc handling cleaned up
* Trimmed code quite a bit
* Several bug fixes
As denoted by the release number, this is an experimental driver
release.  Hackers and testers with MVP4 motherboards are encouraged to
try this out, or perhaps help with implementing scatter-gather DMA (down
with SB legacy mode! :)).
Regards,
	Jeff
