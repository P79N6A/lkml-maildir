it's all in these patches:
andrea@dualathlon:~/remote/kernel.org/kernels/v2.4/2.4.20aa1> ls -1 *sched*
00_flush-inode-reschedule-2
00_sched-O1-aa-2.4.19rc3-5.gz
10_sched-o1-bluetooth-1
10_sched-o1-hyperthreading-3
20_apm-o1-sched-1
20_sched-o1-fixes-8
71_xfs-sched-1
I'm fixing the RT case too right now, in a few days a further fix will
be available to avoid deadlocks of some app with RT enabled.
