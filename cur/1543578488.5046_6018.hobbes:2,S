Subject: Kernel (2.4.0) lock-up using ppp_async - SEVERE - EXPLOIT RUNS AS ANY  USER.

Hi all, hi Paulus.
Is somewhat odd how I got it, but here it goes.
I found a bug in 2.4.0 async PPP driver. I tested the same program in
2.2.17 and it run perfectly (and without hanging).
So, here goes the description:
2.4.0 Kernel hangs up when I do the following stuff:
	* Create a new PTY using openpty();
	* Fork using forkpty. Now, the child process does this:
		- Set the fd 0 line discipline to PPP;
		- tries infinitely to read the standard input.
	The parent process sets the line discipline of the master PTY fd to PPP
also, and then writes to it. As I was able to see (strace), the write
function never returns.
Hopefully SysRQ worked, and I was able to trace the bug to
ppp_async_push. It seems the endless loop there is really endless.
(sigh)
Here's a copy of the "exploit".
