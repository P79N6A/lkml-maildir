After thinking about this some more, I suspect it would have to be
quite large scale SMP to get much contention.
The only contention on the udp socket is, as you say, assembling a udp
frame, and it would be surprised if that takes a substantial faction
of the time to handle a request.
Presumably on a sufficiently large SMP machine that this became an
issue, there would be multiple NICs.  Maybe it would make sense to
have one udp socket for each NIC.  Would that make sense? or work?
It feels to me to be cleaner than one for each CPU.
