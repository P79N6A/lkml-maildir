hmmm ... my system is at 33 case and 34-35 cpu temperature (°C) when it is
idle ... this are not so bad temperatures ... it has temperature
controlled fans which only reach their maximum spin at around 40-45 ... so
the system is not so good coold when it is cooler but produce lesser noise

yes ... the case temp should not go over 40°C but the cpu  is fine if it
is under 45-50°C under load.
