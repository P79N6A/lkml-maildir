Well, in our case it was hardware, bios, firmware, and software.
I was able to get an ASUS, do side by side testing, and then
eventually get the Tyan working as well.
I'll post details once I complete full stress tests in various
configurations, but there *are* configurations that work correctly.
The hardware issue was a passive PCI riser card that only supports
the 3ware in one slot on the Tyan.  Works fine in the ASUS.  Sigh.
Bios is currently set to MP1.1 (will test with MP1.4 soon).
The .019 driver (with matching firmware) from 3Ware seems to be
the minimum required.
I'd like to thank 3ware's support, AngieN and AdamR specifically for
their patience, dilligence and assistance.  Wish all vendors were like
them.
