People are totally confusing two completely seperate issues here.
Flushing for I/O <--> CPU coherency.
Flushing for CPU <--> CPU coherency.
flush_page_to_ram and flush_dcache_page are _ONLY_ for the CPU<-->CPU
coherency issues, not for I/O<-->CPU issues.
The I/O<-->CPU issues need to be handled elsewhere, for example in the
PCI dma mapping interface implementation.
