Yes, and I claim that the best you can get for large messages is a plain 
single copy userspace implementation as already implemented by some people 
using the MPI API.

Yes, doing HPC the kernel may only be used to intialize the intial 
communication channels (e.g. handling permissions etc.). The kernel must be 
avoided for the actual communication by any means.

How fast will you get? I think you will get the bandwidth of a memcpy for 
large chunks?!
This is imho not really zerocopy. The data has to travel over the memory bus 
involving the CPU so I would call this single copy ;-)

Yes a userspace library using the standard MPI API is the proven best approach
