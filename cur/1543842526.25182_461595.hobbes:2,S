Blame the creator of C.
But maybe this was intended, since | is a logical operation, as is <, 
while + is an arithmetic one. Programmatically probably not making much

The GNU C compiler will warn you where such may happen, but
currently does so - too bad - only with && and ||.
 c.c:2: warning: suggest parentheses around && within ||
