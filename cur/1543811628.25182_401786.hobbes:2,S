Subject: [patch 03/39] shmdt cannot detach not-alined shm segment cleanly.

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
sys_shmdt() can manage shm segments which are covered by multiple vmas.  (This
can happen when a user uses mprotect() after shmat().)
This works well if shm is aligned to PAGE_SIZE, but if not, the last
segment cannot be detached.  It is because a comparison in sys_shmdt()
	(vma->vm_end - addr) < size
		addr == return address of shmat()
		size == shmsize, argments to shmget()
size should be aligned to PAGE_SIZE before being compared with vma->vm_end,
which is aligned.
