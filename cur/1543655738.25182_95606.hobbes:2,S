here is what I i got it work with:
--------
static int ali_close_multi_channels(void)
{
        char temp = 0;
        struct pci_dev *pci_dev = NULL;
        pci_dev 
=pci_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL,PCI_DEVICE_ID_AL_M1533,
                pci_dev);
        if (pci_dev == NULL)
                return -1;
-       temp = 0x80;
+       pci_read_config_byte(pci_dev, 0x59, &temp);
+      temp &= ~0x80;
-       pci_write_config_byte(pci_dev, 0x59, ~temp);
+       pci_write_config_byte(pci_dev, 0x59, temp);
        pci_dev = pci_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL,
                PCI_DEVICE_ID_AL_M7101, pci_dev);
        if (pci_dev == NULL)
                return -1;
-       temp = 0x20;
+       pci_read_config_byte(pci_dev, 0xB8, &temp);
+       temp &= ~0x20
-       pci_write_config_byte(pci_dev, 0xB8, ~temp);  // the line I 
+       pci_write_config_byte(pci_dev, 0xB8, temp);  //commented out
        return 0;
}
---------------------
almost as I posted before, just passing pointers to the read method.
It works, but the question as to what is this supposed to affect 
remains...
should similar changes be made elsewhere in this driver? I better not 
change blindly what I do not quite understand...
