Sure. Do not attempt to schedule in an interrupt. Further, you need
to do dynamic memory allocation in your ISR `kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC)`.
That way, since there is most always some time between interrupts, the
kernel gets a chance to make new pages available for the next interrupt
use. Remember to free memory after your current task has read its
contents.
In the unlikely event that you run out of dynamic pages, just dump
the device data on the floor so your device can interrupt again later.
All word ports can be read as:
	while(word_count--)
            i = impw(data_port);
	... to throw away data.
The same idea works for ports of other widths.
Cheers,
