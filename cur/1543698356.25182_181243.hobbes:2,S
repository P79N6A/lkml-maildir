The autofs4 kernel code is already in the mainline kernel and in
redhat's AS kernels.  However:
1) In the mainline its not complete (no direct mounts) 
2) In redhats AS kernels its not supported or complete.  A newer version 
   seems to only make sense.
Putting an upgrade to autofs4 in the mainline kernel once its proven
would give users the option of having a much more feature-complete and
un-broken automounter to use.  If its not hurting anything else then
why leave broken code in the kernel?  
Please correct me if I'm making too big a leap, because I have a
thought.  It seems that new hardware gets this sort of treatment - new
drivers for a NIC, scsi, or FC card will be included in a stable
series because with out it some subsystem of a computer "doesn't
work" completely.  What makes this case different?
