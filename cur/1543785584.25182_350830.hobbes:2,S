No ioctl are not deprecated, but they are just avoided b/c its not
good to mess kernel with new system-calls as there is a different way
for that !!!!
And for user/kernel interaction you have to look for sysfs/kobject and
don't need to go into the details of driver-model if you just need to
do user/kernel interaction and linux device driver 3rd edition's
chapter of driver-model will really help you in user/kernel
interaction (

) ......  (for bi-directional
communication means kernel can also send messeges to user space you
can see netlink-sockets) .........
