I am the maintainer of this code.  Why is this the first time that I
have seen this patch (or even heard of a problem report)?  Marcelo,
please don't apply it.
The correct fix is to change:
ctl &= ~(PARPORT_CONTROL_STROBE | PARPORT_CONTROL_INIT);
so that it also turns off AUTOFD as well.
I have several patches queued up for parport (see
http://people.redhat.com/twaugh/patches/
).  It would be very helpful
to me if you could first send changes to me rather than Marcelo or
Linus, so that merging is not made more difficult.  In addition, there
is a ChangeLog file in that directory; changing the code without
updating the ChangeLog makes my attempt to keep it current futile. :-(
Tim.
