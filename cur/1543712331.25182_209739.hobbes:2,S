If the key is based on hardware details that only root can obtain, it would 
require at least having the time to boot the victim computer into another OS 
to create the key. If the key is also dependant on details of the running 
kernel, it could be even harder to crack it.
Password-based encryption might be wanted for certain cases, but I think most 
cases would do fine to prevent the image from being used for anything except 
restoring on the original system. That way, it would be significantly more 
difficult for someone to gain access to the memory that could be used for 
other encrypted things (such as GPG key generation).
