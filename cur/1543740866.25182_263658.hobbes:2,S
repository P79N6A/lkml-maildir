That's interesting.... 
I ran into this issue where resume was hanging at 8259_resume 
code as the HPET was not counting. That was on an ICH4 based Pentium-M
box.
I will try it on come ICH5 based hardware and see whether it is really 
Required, for both i386 and x86-64, on a wider range of systems.
