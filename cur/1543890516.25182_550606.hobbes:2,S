I realize that this all just touches blackfin-specific stuff, but after 
-rc3 I really prefer not to bother with these things..
Also, for stuff that is really just an architecture that I can't even 
test, and where there is a clear maintainership thing, I'd actually prefer 
to just do a git merge, if possible. It's not like I will likely start 
looking at some blackfin-specific patches. Judging from the diffs, you do 
actually use git, do you have a place where you could export these kinds 
of patch-series as a git tree instead?
