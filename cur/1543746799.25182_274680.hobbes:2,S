Nobody has really done serious C++ work with the base kernel. Getting
things like interrupt safe C++ memory and exception handling is not
exactly trivial
stuff. As such the kernel isn't really designed to be C++ friendly so
there are various uses of names like "new" in the kernel.
Developing kernel modules with C++ probably isn't ideal but I don't see
any problem in fixing the users of variables like "new" if you want to
do it and submit tested patches to akpm@osdl.org.
