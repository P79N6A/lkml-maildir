Right, (a) a tiny PCI probe w/ callback, something easily dropped into
existing drivers, and (b) a big meaty routine like pci-scan or my patch
which takes care of ifdef trees.  
'sizeof(struct pci_simple_probe_entry)' would be a lot smaller than
'sizeof(struct pci_id_info) + sizeof(struct drv_id_info)'.

But not for the common case.  I actually counted in drivers/*.c files,
and the number of drivers which do not need to do this outnumber the
ones that do.  (though the number that do subsys id checks is not at all
insignificant)

My point was that pci-scan flag PCI_NO_MIN_LATENCY indicates that the
default is to set a minimum latency -- something which pci_set_master()
already does.  That block of code is not needed.  Plus storing
'min_pci_latency' as a global in pci-scan.c makes this solution less
granular.  (ie. it might be useful to set a per-device minimum PCI
latency like I demonstrate in my patch)

Probe order and device registration order may matter for any number of
reasons.

Sure.  That's why we're having this discussion.  Or at least why I'm
having it.  :)  To iron out details on a good pci-scan implementation. 
Both patches should use __request_region and ioremap for all flagged
base addresses, for example.  That would clear out a lot of ifdefs.
I outlined in my previous mail why your implementation is inadequate for
some cases, which IMHO are becoming more common at new devices are
released.  For example, multiple PCI base addresses are becoming more
and more common.  Why not handle all the base addresses in a loop,
instead of just simply handling the first one?  Why not also add
__request_region code also?  That's a source of ifdefs.  etc.
