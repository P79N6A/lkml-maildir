Condor is designed for a relatively low performance network (10-100Mbit) and
not for things like an IBM SP switch which can carry Gbit data. It needs
availablility on SP-3/4 and Cray SV systems (not that we have problems
with checkpoint there). Also note:
	Cannot use IPC (pipes shared memory), which also leave out PVM/MPI
	job cannot use threads
	cannot use forks
In many of our cases, the jobs are split across many nodes, then spread
across multiple processors in a single node (SP 3 has 4 cpus per node,
SP 4 will have 8-32). The current scientific library uses PVM/MPI to determine
whether it is using shared memory or node/node RPC.
Tightly integrated models wouldn't work well with Condor (disclaimer:
based on a fast look by me, and I don't work on the current jobs).
