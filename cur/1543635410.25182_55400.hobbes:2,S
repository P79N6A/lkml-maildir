Wish we knew why.  I've tried many times to reproduce the problem
which you're seeing.  With just two gigs of memory, buffer_heads
really cannot explain anything.  It's weird.
We discussed this in Ottawa - I guess Andrea will add the toss-the-buffers
code on the read side (basically the filemap.c stuff).  That may
be sufficient, but without an understanding of what is going on,
it is hard to predict.
