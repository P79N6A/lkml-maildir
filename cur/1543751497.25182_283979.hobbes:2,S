Can you elaborate on what you mean by registering the "real devices properly"?

Yes, this can be done in userspace, so that stuff can be dropped.

Yes, I can use the dev_attrs for this. Thanks for pointing that out.

Yes, probably. Though with the devlist in userspace I suppose it's not overly
useful to have here anyways.

Ok.

Probably because I wasn't aware that the driver core provided one. Now that I
see the bus_for_each_xxx() stuff I'll drop the list and use that instead.

No, the pretty_name was only added for the devlist. I'll clean that up.

Probably not. With that and the list gone I can drop this struct entirely and
just have the root device as a struct device.

superhyway_add_device() calls this. We don't want to assume that CONFIG_SYSFS
will always be enabled. I can move the ifdef in to superhyway_add_device() if
you think it would be cleaner. (And this is needed as we happen to have
superhyway_create_sysfs_files() defined in superhyway-sysfs.c which is only
compiled in when CONFIG_SYSFS is set, and I would rather not link this in
unconditionally).
Thanks for looking at this, I'll post a cleaned up version shortly.
