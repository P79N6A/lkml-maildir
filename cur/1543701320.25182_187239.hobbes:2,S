Subject: 2.6.0 hangs during the rebuild of a RAID-5 set

Hello!  I've encountered a problem which I'm not sure how to go about
debugging, as my efforts so far aren't yielding anything.
Background: This is a P2-400 system with three ATA drives in a
RAID-5 set via the software RAID driver.  Everything works just
fine during normal usage, but if a rebuild of the RAID-5 set starts,
the system soon hangs within a few minutes.  It's not entirely
frozen though, as keyboard input is still echoed to the console and
I can switch VTs, but there's no other response even after waiting
15 minutes.  Disk activity of some sort still seems to occur as the
HD light continues to flicker slightly.  There are no oopses or any
other kernel messages on the console.
I don't know for sure if it's the rebuild itself at fault, as it may
just be things like the I/O load during a rebuild versus normal usage
that actually cause it, but this is the only thing that reliably
triggers it so far.  It's easy to reproduce, at least.
I've tried enabling the Magic SysRq key in order to find out where it's
hung, but hitting Alt-SysRq-p only printed "SysRq : Show Regs" and
nothing else.  Alt-SysRq-b still worked to force a reboot though.
There's also the possibility of bad hardware, but if I boot back to
2.4.22 the rebuild completes without trouble so that seems unlikely,
unless the hardware problem is only tickled by something new in 2.6.0.
I'm not sure what else to do from here; are there any other tools
or tricks I can use to gather more information?  A binary search
through 2.5.x versions?  I admit this isn't exactly a lot to go on.
Thanks!
