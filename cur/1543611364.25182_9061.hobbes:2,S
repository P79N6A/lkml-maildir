Has anybody got the same issue with non Dell machines?
I am running 2.4.16 on a Compaq proliant ML 370 without problems (machine has
been up for 2+ days with the new kernels, though).  Trafic is not very high.
The driver is built into the kernel.
/proc/pci shows
  Bus  0, device   2, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 8).
      IRQ 5.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=56.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xc4fff000 [0xc4ffffff].
      I/O at 0x2400 [0x243f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xc4e00000 [0xc4efffff].
