When ever I try and start a guest OS with kvm I get a lot of these rtc
missing interupt messages from the kernel

I don't have the dynamic ticker set or some of the other high
resolution timer things set
# CONFIG_TICK_ONESHOT is not set
# CONFIG_NO_HZ is not set
# CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS is not set
I do have the rtc group selected as modules though
CONFIG_RTC=m
CONFIG_GEN_RTC=m
CONFIG_GEN_RTC_X=y
...
#
# Real Time Clock
#
CONFIG_RTC_LIB=m
CONFIG_RTC_CLASS=m
#
# RTC interfaces
#
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_SYSFS=m
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_PROC=m
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_DEV=m
CONFIG_RTC_INTF_DEV_UIE_EMUL=y
#
# RTC drivers
#
CONFIG_RTC_DRV_CMOS=m
CONFIG_RTC_DRV_X1205=m
CONFIG_RTC_DRV_DS1307=m
CONFIG_RTC_DRV_DS1553=m
CONFIG_RTC_DRV_ISL1208=m
... and the rest of the drivers as modules
I have the latest kvm-16 and here's how I'm starting the guest OS.
KVER="2.6.9-42.EL"
INITRD_BASE="initrd"
INITRD_APPEND=".img"
APPEND="ro root=LABEL=/ 3 console=ttyS0"
DEV=hda
kvm -kernel "/boot/vmlinuz-${KVER}" \
    -initrd "/boot/${INITRD_BASE}-${KVER}${INITRD_APPEND}" \
    -append "${APPEND}" \
    -nographic -m 256 \
    -net nic,vlan0 \
    -net tap,vlan=0,ifname=tap1,script=no \
    /dev/hda
Anymore information can be easily provided.
Thanks,
