Oh, its an issue, but one the time of day subsystem shouldn't solve. The
code that manages interval (be it timer or whatever) interrupts should
use the time of day subsystem to ensure they are triggering accurately,
and manipulate the intervals as needed.

Yep, all of this is outside what the time of day subsystem should do.
Interval interrupt scheduling should be done by other code (I suggest
the timer code do it).

NTP adjustments need to be applied smoothly and consistently as time
progresses. Adjustment to the NTP parameters occur at do_adjtimex and at
interval boundaries (ie: the interrupt_hook in my code, or look at
update_wall_time and second_overflow in the existing code). So in my
understanding its not really a schedulable function.

I think the functionality is essential, but that it doesn't belong in the time of day code.
Basically we have two things we're trying to do: 
1. Keep accurate time 
2. Generate hardware interrupts accurately
While frequently the same hardware can do both, not all hardware is
usable for both functions. Thus I believe we should cleanly split these
two subsystems. My proposal only provided the keep accurate time part,
however one could using that functionality, to then manipulate hardware
interrupts to ensure accuracy in the timer subsystem.
