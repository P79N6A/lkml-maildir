Hi
Unix/Linux have a lot of daemons that have to run as root because they
need to acces some specific data or run special programs. They are
vulnerable as we learn.
Is there any way to have something like an exec call that is
subject to a sudo like permission system? That would run the daemons
as a normal user but allow only for specific functions i.e. NOT A SHELL.
comments?
