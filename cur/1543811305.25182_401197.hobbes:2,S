If you reply to this, please remove xfs/nathan/eric from cc - it's not
xfs at all, it was (if anything) an lvm bug.

Eric, thanks. A good place to look. The dd just produced 0 bytes.
.....OK - thanks, it's fixed now.
It turns out that the md device stopped before the lvm started. So when
lvm did start it must have seen md1 as 0 bytes.
Then when I re-assembled and ran md1, lvm didn't notice.
Confusingly, the lvm userspace tools *did* notice and gave me 'healthy'
reports (I checked that before mailing - I just didn't actually dd the
lvm device - sorry).
The only clue was ages back in the log:
Adding 1004020k swap on /dev/sdc4.  Priority:-1 extents:1 across:1004020k
md: md1 stopped.
md: bind<sdb1>
md: bind<sda1>
md: bind<sdd1>
device-mapper: 4.4.0-ioctl (2005-01-12) initialised: dm-devel@redhat.com
cdrom: open failed.
device-mapper: dm-linear: Device lookup failed
device-mapper: error adding target to table
So at this point lvm is sick - but why do the userspace tools report as
below?
haze:/usr/src/linux-2.6.15# lvm version
  LVM version:     2.01.04 (2005-02-09)
  Library version: 1.01.04 (2005-08-02)
  Driver version:  4.4.0
These commands were issued cronologically and represent my basic diagnosis.

(In retrospect I guess I should have stopped and started lvm, not just
started it)
Mount now fails so I start to check things out...
