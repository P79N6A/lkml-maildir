That's what we do now.  Try editing an MP3's id tags.

The interfaces we've been talking about are very close to that.  The
indirection is automatic: instead of a document (or program) looking
like a directory, it'll look like a file, and reading (or executing)
the file will do the indirection, with kernel control (and so
consistency and performance) via an appropriate flat<->structured
relation helper.
