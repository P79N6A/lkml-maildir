Well, I'm on vacation now, so cannot answer much, too :)
IIRC, the problem was with HD-audio and network devices on Nvidia.
The explicit call of pci_intx() (currently implemented in hd-audio
driver locally) helped avoiding the orphan irq problem, but doesn't
fix the MSI problem itself.  (Some might have been fixed indeed,
but I don't have reports in hands.)
