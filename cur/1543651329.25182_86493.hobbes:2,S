As a side issue each of these "users", or most of them, has likely also
its own group and one needs also few groups for other purposes.  Seems
like the next potential point to bump into a numbers of groups barrier
although probably most of these does not need to be shared.  Still if
this will become a part of a widely used security mechanisms there could
be extra demands on memberships.
