Yes. The swap-prefetch patch ensures that the machine (well, the VM) is very 
idle before it allows itself to kick in.

Yes, I believe this might be an important point. Earlier I posted a dumb 
little VM thrasher:

Contrived thing and all, but what it does do is show exactly how bad seeking 
all over swap-space is. If you push it out before hitting enter, the time it 
takes easily grows past 10 minutes (with my 768M) versus sub-second (!) when 
it's all in to start with.
What are the tradeoffs here? What wants small chunks? Also, as far as I'm 
aware Linux does not do things like up the granularity when it notices it's 
swapping in heavily? That sounds sort of promising...

Okay.
