Speaking about messing up; also writing to 2 bytes located after each
other by 2 processors can mess up things. On a Sparc processor for
example.
e.g.:
char dummy[2];
when processor 1 writes to dummy[0] at the same time as processor 2
writes to
dummy[1], you'll get into trouble.

Ehrm, I'm not sure why I wrote it down here since it has nothing to do
with the
thread. Sorry for that, probably my ego needing some boost.
