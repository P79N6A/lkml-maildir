When you hook it onto whatever queues you are using internally to track
pages which need writeback.  The concept "this page needs writeback" is
one which the filesystem needs to track --- it's not part of the page
cache.  In the 2.3 ext2 case, the buffer cache is the mechanism used to
queue the writes, but you can use something else if you want to.
