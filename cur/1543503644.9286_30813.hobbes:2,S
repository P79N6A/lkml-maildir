Maybe three kinds, see:

   Some types of processing (eg. multimedia) do not fit well into the
   hard or soft real-time categories. The periodic requests made by
   multimedia applications are sensitive to variations in timing. As
   such, they are not well served by the loose guarantees provided by
   soft real-time systems. Hard real-time systems are often faced with
   providing guarantees at the expense of providing services. Thus, while
   they can meet the timing requirements of a multimedia application,
   many times they cannot meet it's other service requirements. For
   example, real-time processes running under RTLinux have no access to
   any of the Linux services.
   A purely binary distinction between hard and soft real-time is clearly
   not acceptable for all applications. Many applications have
   requirements spanning a continuum between the two. ...
