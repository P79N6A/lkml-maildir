I made this patch because I saw __init calling __exit in yet another
driver (gianfar). Guess I'll just send the old way fix, and remove __exit.
As for calling __init_exit from __exit:
1 - in kernel, there's no __exit => no problem
2 - module, __init_exit is a no-op => no problem
the code in question again:

Or maybe it's the name that is confuzing, but it makes sense to me:
__init_exit - you can call it from __init or __exit.
__init_or_exit?
