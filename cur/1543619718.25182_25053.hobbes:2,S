Yes, in fact we do have entropy generators in some cases, especially on
Solaris.  I think this is a very good idea -- it would be extremely nice
to see this especially since SO much more is dependent upon entropy
these days.  More than about 7 years ago I would have thought entropy
was a nethack clone.
Of course, in my case deleting the /dev/random character node still
doesn't allow entropy to drain in (after at least a month) so I suspect
the kernel's entropy generation would be sufficient if it didn't
artificially stall or drain from within the kernel.
Thanks much,
