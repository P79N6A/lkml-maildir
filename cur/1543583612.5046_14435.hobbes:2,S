Linus has spoken, and 2.4.x now requires swap = 2x RAM.
But, the 2GB per swap partition limit still exists, best as we can tell.
So, we sell machines with say 8GB RAM.  We need 16GB swap, but really we
need like an 18GB disk with 8 2GB swap partitions, or ideally 8 disks with a
2GB swap partition on each.  That's ugly.
Is the 2GB per swap partition going to go away any time soon?
Thanks,
Matt
