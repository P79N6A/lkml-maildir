Shouldn't it be protocols thingie to take care about connections ?
Ussualy some protocols are sending ping packet to peer. 
This value as it is now, keeps too many connections in memory, which often leads
to conntrack overflow, that blocks litteraly whole machine up. That is nothing
more than DoS, and besides, there is no fallback routine, something that uppon
error would react. Like, flush very likely to be dead connections, etc.
