your picture below doesn't show that containers have nested containers. 
You draw a plain container set inside vserv.
What I mean is that if some container user can create another container, 
it DOES not mean it is nested. It is just about permitions to create 
other containers. Nested containers in my POV is something different, 
when you can see the resources of your container and your children. You see?
I will try to show what I mean on a picture:

You see what I mean? In this example with IPC sharememory container 1 
can see all the shm segments. while container1.1.2 can see only his 
private one smm1.1.2.1.
And if resources are not nested like this, than it is a PLAIN container 
structure.
