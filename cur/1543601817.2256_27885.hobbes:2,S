   For the flush_cache_all for the virtually indexed caches should be the
   same issue in theory (at least the kmap logic only needs to flush the
   caches before the unmapping [not before the mapping] too)
   Am I missing something, Dave?
Anything that creates or takes away vmalloc() mappings needs to flush
the data cache if it is virtuall indexed.
I am always uncomfortable when I see people suggesting to remove
flushes from kernel virtual mapping setup/teardown.
