I may have missed them, but what I saw from him weren't specific issues, 
but instead a nebulous 'something better may come along later'

yes it was contrived for simplicity.
the same effect would happen if instead of going back to firefox the user 
instead went to their e-mail software and read some mail. doing so should 
still make the machine idle enough to let prefetch kick in.

how long does the machine need to be idle? if someone spends 30 seconds 
reading an e-mail that's an incredibly long time for the system and I 
would think it should be enough to let the prefetch kick in.

swapin will always require disk access, and avoiding doing disk access 
while the user is waiting for it by doing it when the system isn't useing 
the disk will always be a win (possibly not as large of a win, but still a 
win) on slow laptop drives where you may only get 20MB/second of reads 
under optimal situations it doesn't take much reading to be noticed by the 
user.

and these thing do not conflict with prefetch, they compliment it.
improved use-once will avoid pushing things out to swap in the first 
place. this will help during normal workloads so is valuble in any case.
better swapin (I assume you are talking about things like larger swap 
granularity) will also help during normal workloads when you are thrashing 
into swap.
prefetch will help when you have pushed things out to swap and now have 
free memory and a momentarily idle system.
