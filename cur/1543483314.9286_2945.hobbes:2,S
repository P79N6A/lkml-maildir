If by any chance he is running IP masq on that router, things may become
different. My experience shows that linux won't send back the ICMP error
message in this case (eth. MTU 1550, slip MTU smaller, big packet wants
to go through masq box but it never gets through and no ICMP message is
generated). But it should since it's the point where the MTU gets
smaller.
I tested it in 2.0.33 days, maybe things have changed. But somebody just
wrote about this in linux-kernel about a week ago ("possible bug in ip
masquerade" or something similar).
