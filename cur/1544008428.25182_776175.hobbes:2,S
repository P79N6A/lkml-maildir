Ok, how about this:
there's one common point in lirc_dev where all IR timing data is handled.
Jon's code can grab the data at this point and feed it into its state  
machine. That way there's no need to change any of the existing drivers.
And we all work together to get this stuff ready for inclusion into the  
kernel.
