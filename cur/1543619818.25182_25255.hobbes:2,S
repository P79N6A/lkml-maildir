Please don't send this patch in for inclusion, it's broken it several
places. Subtly broken, which means it could take ages for it to be fixed
for real... Hint: a bio can contain more than one page.
I really do appreciate folks trying to fix up block drivers, but please
send the patches through me for verification.
Plus, DAC960 will break as soon as ->address disappears from the
scatterlist. It has been in dire need of a pci api conversion for a
loooong time. Leonard, what is the status on this?
