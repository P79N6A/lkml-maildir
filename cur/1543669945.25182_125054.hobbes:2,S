Agreed. Having a runtime-tweakable field would be very handy, and 
something that's been requested many times over.

Something I've pondered in the past is a per-subsystem (as in struct 
subsystem) debug field and log buffer. When the subsystem is registered, a 
sysfs 'debug' file is created, from which the user can set the noisiness 
level. 
From there, each subsystem can specify the size of a log buffer, which 
would be allocated also when the subsystem is registered. Messages from 
the subsystem, and kobjects belonging to it, would be copied into the 
local log buffer. 
Wrapper functions can be created, similar to the dev_* functions, which 
take a kobject as the first parameter. From this, the subsystem and log 
buffer, can be derived (or rather, passed to a lower-level helper). 
This all falls under the 'gee-whiz-this-might-be-neat' category, and may
inherently suck; I haven't tried it. Doing the core code is < 1 day's
work, though there would be nothing that actually used it..
