Indeed; I just wanna raise the point before people start actually using /init
in large numbers...
I wonder if you could move the bulk of stuff (the console open, the calls to
run_init_proces) that happens after prepare_namespace into a separate
function and attempt to call it both before and after prepare_namespace; the
problem seems to be the unlock_kernel &c., which I gather must be done after
prepare_namespace?
