Good thing first: I can't trigger the oopses with 2.0e6. I tried hard, didn't
manage to.
However, trying to trigger a race condition, I found that your script suffers
from too small a kernel API in this place, since it uses the
remove-single-device and all-single-devices in a non-locked manner, so if you
run several instances of your script in parallel (simple rescan-scsi-bus.sh -r
& will do) it will give a mess and may leave you with missing devices.
I don't currently recall if your web site states that your script may only be
run once at the same time; lock files would be nice :-]
To recall my devices:
#2 Plextor PX-32TS 1.02
#3 Yamaha CRW4416S 1.0j
#4 HP 35480A 12.09
#5 Plextor PX-20TS 1.00
#6 Tandberg TDC4222
The first run of your rescan-scsi-script showed that the "scsi
singledevice 1 0 2 0" command was aborted due to timeout, and the
Plextor PX-32TS is known to require at least 5 s settling time after a
bus reset in my Tekram DC-390U (SYM53C875) BIOS, so it may actually be the
drive itself that gives us headaches.
Result of first rescan-scsi-bus.sh -r:
all 5 devices removed, and only #3 ... #6 added (#2, Plextor PX-32
missing)
During scanning, I got these (the first two aborts and the SCSI bus reset look
right since I hotplugged the entire bus to the other adaptor)

A subsequent rescan-scsi-bus.sh will find the PX-32TS and add it, this time,
without bus resets and aborts.
Should the reset->inquiry delay be applied after ANY reset? Is it actually
applied but too short for my Plextor?
