fine, thanks!

Agreed.

The defines are ok but according to Matt they're not using atomic
operations, infact they works fine until you beat them hard. Infact I
guess it may trigger even in x86 in theory, I suspect it doesn't trigger
by luck, I think we should at least declare the __u16 pointer as
volatile or gcc may be free to do whatever it does on alpha without
using the bitops. The patch is actually using an #ifdef __alpha__
because it relys on the fact alpha internally does the 32bit accesses
with the bitops (so it doesn't mess with the other registers).

I forgotten it, Alan noticed it too. thanks for the reminder.

Ok, then I will add define_bool CONFIG_NO_PAGE_VIRTUAL y to sparc and
sparc64.

On modern x86 it should be faster to compute it to save dcache, memory
bandwith and ram.
Thanks for the review!
