It's recording relocations that get fixed up at boot time.
The way it works is that each btfixup emits a reference to a symbol
that will be unresolved.
The btfixup tool under arch/sparc/boot/ scans the unlinked kernel
image, generates dummy symbol definitions into a foo.s file so that
the kernel can be linked, and builds the btfixup tables so the kernel
can patch up these relocations at boot time.
