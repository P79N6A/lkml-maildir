Hello all,
I use devfs to manage my /dev.
I symlinked /etc/mtab to /proc/mounts.
My root fs is on /dev/sdb1 and stays RO.
There is not /etc/fstab entry for it
(I hate making new Linux partitions by copying my old system, boot
them and discover I forgot to change root entry in /etc/fstab - kernel
already knows where root is, so why do I need to tell that?).
I have trouble with fsck'ing my root fs from init script.
As you can see below:
"fsck /" can't figure out from where my root is mounted.
"fsck /dev/sdb1" works fine, but that means init script must be
modified when root mount point is changed.
"fsck /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/part1" is suitable for init
script (I could get dev name from /proc/mounts)
but complaining about mounted fs (why? my root fs is RO).
So, how can I fsck my root?
# cat /etc/mtab
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/part1 / ext2 ro 0 0
...
