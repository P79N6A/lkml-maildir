Sorry guys!
I say it wrong way, I mean:
Other programs would like use build-in and "standard" linux XML-parser.
It would make standard way to read xml-files in Linux?
Advertise speech:
    No more 1 000 different XML readers, only one, and people can
make it better :D
Michael Buesch, that source you paste, it is good, it is better than mine! :)
Comments please!
