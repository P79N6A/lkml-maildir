I'm worried about two things:
1) If the per-bdi threshold becomes smaller than the granularity of
   the per-bdi stat (due to the per-CPU counters), then things will
   break.  Shouldn't there be some sanity checking for the calculated
   threshold?
2) The loop is sleeping in congestion_wait(WRITE), which seems wrong.
   It may well be possible that none of the queues are congested, so
   it will sleep the full .1 second.  But by that time the queue may
   have become idle and is just sitting there doing nothing.  Maybe
   there should be a per-bdi waitq, that is woken up, when the per-bdi
   stats are updated.
Thanks,
Miklos
