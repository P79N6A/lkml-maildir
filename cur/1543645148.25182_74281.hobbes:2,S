Robert,
Glad we agree on the lock issue, thanks for confirming the point!
There is an issue of interrupt acknowledgement and when one can pre-empt.
I would like to resolve the issue, but I need a global caller/notifier api
from you so I can block IO in a safe spot on the 'data transfer' state
bar.  Yeah, blah blah on underfined terms.
Some how I need to figure out how to address the pre-empt and keep the
driver data stable.  Initially I would suggest throttling back on the
request size to maybe 4k or 8k regardless.  I may not sound right but it
will serve the purpose.
Cheers,
