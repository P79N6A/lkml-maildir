This is exactly how OSS API works. The application can check if there were 
any errors so far. It can do it after finishing the playback or whenever 
it likes. It can then show a dialog box saying that playback/recording 
was not 100% error free. Alternatively it can show error counters on the 
status line. Or most applications just don't care.
Best regards,
