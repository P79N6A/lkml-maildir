Interesting. In the old day, since mm->page_table_lock is held for the
entire unmap_vmas function, it was beneficial to introduce periodic
reschedule point and to drop the spin lock under pressure. Now that the
page table lock is fine-grained and is pushed into zap_pte_range(), I
would think scheduling latency would improve from lock contention
avoidance point of view.  It is not the case?
