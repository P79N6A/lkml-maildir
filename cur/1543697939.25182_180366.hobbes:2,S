Hi,
I have a Promise 20269-based UDMA 133 IDE controller.  If I have DMA
enabled on this controller, then when it is seeing heavy write activity,
the system freezes.  No messages on the console, ctrl-alt-del does
nothing, magic sysrq does nothing.
Reads do not appear to cause this problem, and the problem also
disappears if I disable DMA on the drive connected to the controller by
using hdparm.
System information:
Linux pi 2.4.22 #3 Sat Oct 25 15:45:50 CDT 2003 i586 GNU/Linux
AMD K6 400MHz processor
lspci:
00:08.0 Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc. 20269
(rev 02)
Drive: Maxtor 6Y160P0 150GB UDMA 133
I have, in my .config:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y
Thanks for any insight.
