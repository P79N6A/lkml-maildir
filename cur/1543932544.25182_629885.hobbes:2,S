How do we detect those pages reliably in the lumpy reclaim code?

Agreed.
The main reason I sent out these patches now is that I just
wanted to get some comments from other upstream developers.
I have gotten distracted by other work so much that I spent
most of my time forward porting the patch set, and not enough
time working with the rest of the upstream community to get
the code moving forward.
To be honest, I have only briefly looked at the non-reclaimable
code.  I would be more than happy to merge any improvements to
that code.
