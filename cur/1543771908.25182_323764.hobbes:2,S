Hrm. So, I've been looking into this and I'm a bit stumped, as I'm not
really changing the behavior of sched_clock().
sched_clock() is a pretty bad interface as it just takes the current TSC
value (relative to zero) and scales it using the current cpukhz value
(well, indirectly using cycles_2_ns). Since it doesn't ever accumulate
the past time, frequency changes affect the full interval (since the TSC
was reset) which can cause large errors. The rational for this was that
sched_clock() was supposed to be as fast as possible just to give a
quick guide to the scheduler and occasional incorrect values are
acceptable. 
I'm looking further into it, but could you send me privately the dmesg
output for both with and without the TOD patch?
thanks
