As you have *map* - *unmap* macros / functions, they give a _hint_
that the original intention of the author was to allow some
architectures - which do need some resources to map things -
manage these resources. See:
static inline void *kmap(struct page *page)
#define kunmap(page)
#define kmap_atomic(page, idx)
#define kunmap_atomic(addr, idx)
#define kmap_atomic_to_page(ptr)
I think we cannot guarantee that we will never ever need to
unmap things. As it is required to use kmap - kunmap in pair,
it is quite logic to use kmap_atomic* in pair with kunmap_atomic.
I think it is a bad programming style to abuse the fact that
some macros are no-ops for the most popular architectures.
I think we should have some global counters in DEBUG mode which
are incremented on each call to *map* and decremented on each
*unpap* call, and we can detect, ooops, it leaks...
