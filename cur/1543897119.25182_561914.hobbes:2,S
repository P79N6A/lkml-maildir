It bases its optimisation decisions on the options you give
it, the profile feedback information you either or not gave
it, and a whole bunch of heuristics.

For optimal performance, you need to fine-tune options yes,
per file (or per function even!)

I speak only for myself.  However this is the only way it _can_
be, the compiler isn't clairvoyant.  Some of the heuristics sure
could use some tuning, but they stay heuristics.
