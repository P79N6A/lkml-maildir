Hi there...
We were having problems with an Intel ether express card in a loaded
server. The card will sometimes die and say
'Attempting to restart transmitter'
This was with kernels 2.2.12, 2.2.13 and 2.2.14
I used the patch posted by Savochkin Andrey Vladimirovich against 2.2.14
and things went well for a day. Now the server has died with the following
error scrolling on it.... 
eth0: can't fill rx buffer (force 1)!
eth0: can't fill rx buffer (force 1)!
eth0: can't fill rx buffer (force 1)!
eth0: can't fill rx buffer (force 1)!
eth0: card reports no resources.
eth0: can't fill rx buffer (force 1)!
eth0: can't fill rx buffer (force 1)!
eth0: can't fill rx buffer (force 1)!
Before, we could gain access to the machine through the serial console.
With this driver and this error, we are unable to get to it even through
the serial console so we can't remotely reboot the machine.
Any advice on this would be _MUCH_ appreciated!
