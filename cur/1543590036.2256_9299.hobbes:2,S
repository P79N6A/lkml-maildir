Not an option with the Radeon unfortunately.  At least, not yet.  Whenever
I find the solution (recently a bunch of people have suggested a bunch of
things to try on dri-devel - thanks guys!) I'll post to that list what
fixed it since I know I am not the only person seeing this kind of
problem.  I think some of the guys are looking into improving the docs a
bit, so maybe if I find it soon the problem and workaround will get
documented.  =)
