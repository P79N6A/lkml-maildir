Because the number of wakeups reported to FUTEX_WAKE must _exactly_
match the number of wakeups reported to FUTEX_WAIT.
They are like tokens, and for some data structures the return value
mustn't be lost or ignored, because that would break structure
invariants - such as the matching counters in the pthread condvars
which precipitated this thread.

My little joke, as I wouldn't have known about this if Andrew Morton
hadn't forwarded me the message asking about it (I've been away from l-k).
