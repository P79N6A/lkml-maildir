It works fine.

Note that there was a precise reason for not implementing it as the TSC disable
(infact at first in 2.2.x I was clearing the bigflag in x86_capabilities too).
The reason is that the way TSC gets disabled breaks /proc/cpuinfo.  Furthmore
in english sense if "the cpu has fxsr or xmm" doesn't mean we can use them at
runtime in the kernel. Such wrong assumption was the source of the 2.4.0 md bug
in first place ;). So I'm not excited we're back in the old way. But of course
those are minor issues and I'm not that concerned /proc/cpuinfo changes even if
the CPU remains the same because nobody should need nofxsr and notsc anyways...
This is a leftover btw:
