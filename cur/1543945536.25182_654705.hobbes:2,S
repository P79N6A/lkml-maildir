To be more precise: dereferencing alone won't cause an exception for
NULL pointers on s390. Only writes will do so.
That is very architecture specific since we cannot unmap page 0,
it contains per-cpu data -- like exception pointers and all such stuff
that the cpu needs.
Just in case there is any code that relies on the fact that also reads
via a NULL pointer are supposed to failed.
