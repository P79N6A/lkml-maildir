Sure it's important for not-previously-present mappings, when you're
installing a present pte.  But the "file pte" being installed by
install_file_pte is not a real pte - it's a non-present entry (like
a swap entry), noting what file offset should be mapped there when
there's a fault (in a non-linear vma where that's not obvious).
