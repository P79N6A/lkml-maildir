Hi Guillaume,
Please visit 
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/pagg/
The page has been updated to provide information on a per job
accounting project called 'job' based on PAGG.
There is one userspace rpm and one kernel  module for job.
This may provide what you are looking for. It is a mature product
as well. I am sure Limin(job) and Erik(pagg) would appreciate any
input you can provide to make 'job' more useful.
Regards,
  - jay
