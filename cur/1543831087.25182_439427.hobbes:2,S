As the MAINTAINER of EMU10K1, I am happy for EMU10K1 driver to be 
removed from the kernel.
ALSA #1735 is now closed. All the apps the user was trying also support 
ALSA natively now, so OSS is not needed.
ALSA #1782 requires more information from the user. I am expecting this 
to be a configuration problem, and not a driver problem.
