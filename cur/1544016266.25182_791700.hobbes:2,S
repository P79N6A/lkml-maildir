Well, Arjan's commit, efaee192: "async: make the final inode deletion
an asynchronous event", does change how inodes get deleted, and this
looks like a race where an inode is getting deleted during the umount.
So I would try reverting commit efaee192 and see if it fixes things
before starting a full bisect...
