I already have the 'alsactl restore' in my rc.local.  Would there be any 
harm in just adding the -F to that invocation, or will that just restore 
it to a 'default' condition always.  Seems like it would, canceling 
anything you have done & then did an 'alsactl store' to save..

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
