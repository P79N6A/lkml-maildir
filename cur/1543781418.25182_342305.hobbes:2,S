Is the kernel really needed for this trick, or could a daemon similiar to
gpm do the job instead?  I.e. the daemon reads the evdev device (when
it is there) and writes to a FIFO. X pulls events out of the other end of
that FIFO.  If the device goes away, the daemon simply waits for it to
reappear, possibly hooking into hotplug if that helps. The FIFO does
not go away, so X is happy.  X just waits till events appear again.
