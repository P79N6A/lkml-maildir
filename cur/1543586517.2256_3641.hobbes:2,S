Greetings.
Is vmalloc() interface broken on any of 2.4.x kernel on ia64 ?
I am trying to call vmalloc from the driver to allocate
about 130kb of memory and it hangs the system.
I am running 2.4.1 kernel with ia64 patch (I can find out the
exact patch if needed) on LION. Let me know if more information
is required.
Thanks and regards,
-hiren
