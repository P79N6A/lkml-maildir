Is it necessary to try something complex. We already keep per cpu/per irq
data and if you have a lot of interrupts it feels like you can handwave them
to be roughly the same amount of cpu load. 
Given that is it enough to once a second shuffle the irqs around to try and
get a rough balance based on a simple decaying history. Then all it needs
is a regular timer event to do what the hardware hasnt
