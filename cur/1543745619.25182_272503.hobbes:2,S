You're wrong :)
Nowadays the power consumption of a CPU is more than the rest of the 
machine altogether (including hard disks, etc.).
On my P4 2.8GHz HT CPU, I've measured the power consumed by *the entire 
computer* more than doubling as the processor went from idle into 100% 
load.
Of course, this doesn't include a monster 3D card, is it could very well 
consume something close to the processor when doing a lot of 3D operations.
