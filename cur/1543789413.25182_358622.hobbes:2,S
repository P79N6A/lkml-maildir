Maybe for a more experienced kernel person such as
yourself, this distinction make sense.  But
"process timer" and "kernel timer" don't carry much
semantic value for me.  They seem to convey an
arbitrary expectation of usage patterns.  Maybe
they match the current usage patterns in the kernel,
but I'd prefer naming based on functionality or
behaviour of the API.

IMHO yes.  I think having separate APIs will eventually be
beneficial to allow better handling of resolution
manipulation in the future.
For example, timeouts are likely to need less resolution,
and it may be valuable to adjust the resolution of timeouts
to support coalescing timeouts for better tickless operation.
(Driving towards better power management performance for
embedded devices.)

I'm not sure if you are arguing for renaming the
old API.  I would be in favor of this (from an abstract
perspective, to clarify the usage in the kernel), but
it might be too big a change right now.
