hi, it occurred to me that instead of cut/paste all the sys_* functions
in fs/*.c for this proxyfs kernel module i am doing that i could
instead, if i could get hold of some user memory, call the sys_*
functions directly.
can i just do this:
	char __user *filename = kmalloc(strlen(kfilename)+1, GFP_USER);
and then this:
	sys_rename(filename, ...);
and expect it to work?
ta,
l.

Truth, honesty and respect are rare commodities that all spring from
the same well: Love.  If you love yourself and everyone and everything
around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
