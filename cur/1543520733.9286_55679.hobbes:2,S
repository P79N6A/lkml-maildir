Hi Istvan,
You said

No, it is not in the recent kernels. The 2.3.36-pre1 setup.S says:
# check for Micro Channel (MCA) bus
        movw    %cs, %ax                        # aka SETUPSEG
        subw    $DELTA_INITSEG, %ax             # aka INITSEG
        movw    %ax, %ds
        xorw    %ax, %ax
        movw    %ax, (0xa0)                     # set table length to 0
        movb    $0xc0, %ah
        stc
        int     $0x15                           # moves feature table to
es:bx
so, there is only one movw above.
regards,
