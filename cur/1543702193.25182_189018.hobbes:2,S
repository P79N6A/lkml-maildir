 Ahhh. That would be a major venture. It would actually be my first
encounter with building 2.6. I am afraid I cannot do that on the
machines in question. Not now :-(

 No idea how smart the Cisco box is that the customer provided us with.
But. it is the same switch that works wit 2.4.21.

 Hmm. What do you mean by "do not have IP multicasting turned on"? It
is definitely compiled in.
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST=y is set in the kernel config file.Would there be
anything needed at runtime?

 The best I can do is pointing you to the source of Ganglia.
http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/
 "netstat -a" from good/bad machines is appended. Not much to see.

 "netstat -s" does not show anything that I would recognize as "drop
statisitcs". Basically everything looks OK. All counters that I would
associate with failures seem to be stable. In any case, output is
appended for the "bad" machine.

 Hmm. I thought that was visible from the tcpdumps I sent?

 It was compiled in. I have now removed it, but it makes no difference.
