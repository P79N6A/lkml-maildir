I thought about that, but I'm unsure if there's any way to get from
that offset to the directory information.  As far as I can tell,
there's no concept of an inode separate from directory entry on iso9660
--- the directory entry/entries all contain all the information that
describes a file.  Which means that the inumber has to point to some
directory node.
Preferably, all the inumbers for the same file would point to the same
directory entry; but I can see no easy way to do that.  Keeping an
in-memory table for files with multiple links might be the best way,
as there aren't that many on a typical filesystem.
