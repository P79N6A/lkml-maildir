You are currently corrupting the user's FPU state.
The proper way to save it is to use kernel_fpu_begin()

That looks rather wasteful - first force it out and then trying to get it in 
again. I have my doubts on it being a good strategy for speed.

Use special function calls for them, don't put it into generic 
copy_*_user
Also you should really check for small copy and not use the FPU based
copy for them. Best is probably to use a relatively simply copy_*_user
(no FPU tricks, just an unrolled integer core) and change the VFS
and the file systems to call a special function from write(), but only
when the write is big.
