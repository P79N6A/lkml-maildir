I think this should be standard function, I'm sure lots of people are
duplicating this code.  For 2.4 kernels:
/*
 * Convert a device path to a kdev_t.
 */
static int lookup_device(const char *path, kdev_t *dev)
{
	int r;
	struct nameidata nd;
	struct inode *inode;
	if (!path_init(path, LOOKUP_FOLLOW, &nd))
		return 0;
	if ((r = path_walk(path, &nd)))
		goto out;
	inode = nd.dentry->d_inode;
	if (!inode) {
		r = -ENOENT;
		goto out;
	}
	if (!S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode)) {
		r = -EINVAL;
		goto out;
	}
	*dev = inode->i_rdev;
 out:
	path_release(&nd);
	return r;
}
