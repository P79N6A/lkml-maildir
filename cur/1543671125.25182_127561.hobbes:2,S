There is a subtle issue that we need to consider regarding "canonize" 
and its meaning of "to make canonical".
Are we saying:
(a) To add something to the canon
or
(b) To change something so that it conforms to the canon
"Canonize" is ambiguous.  Its first definition, to make into a saint, in 
fact conforms to (a) above, which, I believe, is NOT the definition we 
want!  In fact, all of the m-w.com definitions conform to (a).
Unless I misunderstand, we are not adding anything to the canon here. 
 So even if (b) is (somewhere) an acceptable meaning of "canonize" the 
ambiguity obscures what we're intending to say.
On the other hand, "canonicalize", while strange and new, unambiguously 
means (b).
Is there an already-existing word which means (b)?
