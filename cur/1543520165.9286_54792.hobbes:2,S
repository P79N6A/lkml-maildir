Hi,
I want to create a new memory page and map this to the
a user  process address space. And also want to change the
default page fault handler of this page.
but I dont know linux supports these type of things.
If it does not support how can I modify the kernel
source for this purposes. I need any information or
web url about this.
Thank you.
