Hi all,
I am running Redhat 9 Linux.
I have problem with compiling the i810fb driver downloaded from
Sourceforge site. I have D/W the i810fb patch
"linux-i810fb-0.0.35.tar.bz2".
When I run the make modules I get the following ERROR
i810_main.c: 643: warning: passing arg 1 of 'remap_page_range_R2baf18f2'
makes pointer from integer without a cast
i810_main.c: 643: incompatible type for argument 4 of
'remap_page_range_R2baf18f2'
i810_main.c: 643: too few arguments to function
'remap_page_range_R2baf18f2'
Make[3]: *** [I810_main.c] Error 1
........
......
The call to "remap_page_range()" is as follows:-
return (io_remap_page_range(vma->vm_start, off, vma->vm_end -
vma->vm_start, vma->vm_page_prot)) ? -EAGAIN : 0;
Please suggest me what could be the problem.
Regards,
Mukund jampala
