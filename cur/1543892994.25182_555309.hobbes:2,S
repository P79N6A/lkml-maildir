"You might also want to assign library and application ranges for clarity."
So let's see. We have the legacy one (1st fdtable), the non-legacy app one 
(2nd fdtable) and one for the library (3rd fdtable). And which library? 
Each one his own (4th, 5th ... fdtable)? ...

... complexity does not come from the allocator, but from the fact that 
direct access to the fdtable is done all over the kernel. Code that 
assumes there's only *one* fdtable.
