The result is always a linear skb.  Given that skb_padto() takes into
account data_len (incorrectly, but still) and skb_pad() contains a
comment about non-linear skb always having zero tailroom, it certainly
looks like these were written with the attempt to work for non-linear
buffers.
I fail to see how the statement "skb->len + skb->data_len" has any
usable meaning, or how it can be anything other than a bug.
The checksum issue I mentioned is not as clear.  I haven't looked at all
the callers of skb_copy_expand() and copy_skb_header() to see what
effect copying ip_summed in one of those calls might have elsewhere.

So because the problem is not currently exposed, it's acceptable for the
code to be incorrect?
