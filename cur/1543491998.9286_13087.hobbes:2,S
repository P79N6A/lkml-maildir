Greetings, 
I have written a built-in kernel debugger
for the Linux operating system on Intel 32-bit Architecture platforms. 
It is being made available for general use and abuse under the standard linux
licensing terms (see ./COPYING in the linux source distribution).
The debugger is part of the linux kernel and provides a means of examining 
kernel memory and data structures while the system is operational. 
Additional commands may be easily added to format and display essential 
system data structures given an identifier or address of the data 
structure. Current command set allows complete control of kernel 
operations including single-stepping a processor, stopping upon 
execution of a specific instruction, stopping upon access (or 
modification) of a specific virtual memory location, stopping upon 
access to a register in the input-output address space, stack 
tracebacks for the current active task as well as for all other tasks 
(by process id), instruction disassembly, et. al. 
To use the kernel debugger, unzip the patch found at 
http://reality.sgi.com/slurn_engr/
  
and apply the patch as normal to your linux 2.2.3 or 2.2.4 source tree 
(it hasn't been tested yet with 2.2.5). Configure the new kernel 
ensuring that the CONFIG_KDB and CONFIG_KDB_FRAMEPTR configuration 
options are enabled (via xconfig, menuconfig, oldconfig or config make 
options).
Version 0.1 of the built-in kernel debugger for Linux provides the 
following features:
    Instruction Breakpoints
    Data Access Breakpoints 
    Single Instruction Execution
    Stack tracebacks 
    Stack traceback for arbitrary processes
    Ability to switch cpus in SMP system
    Memory examination and modification
    Instruction disassembly
    Access to static and global symbols by name
    Register access and modification
After applying the kernel debugger patch to a 2.2.3 or 2.2.4
source tree and recompiling, one can enter the debugger in the
following ways:
    An ooops will cause the debugger to be invoked automatically
    Likewise a data access fault in kernel mode
    Using the 'kdb' flag on the lilo command line
    Using the 'pause' key
