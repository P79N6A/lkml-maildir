"device topology"?

One thing I've never seen comprehensively addressed is: why do this in
the filesystem at all?  Why not let MD take care of all this and
present a single block device to the fs layer?
Lots of filesystems are violating this, and I'm sure the reasons for
this are good, but this document seems like a suitable place in which to
briefly decribe those reasons.
