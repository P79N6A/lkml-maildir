Hi! Rik,
Thanks for your help.
I have successfully patched the kernel with your patches
recompiled and installed it on my development system
the hardware of which is identical to my Production machine (e.g. 8CPU, 8GB
RAM)
I compiled the kernel with glibc-2.2.2-10 (redhat)
I did some performance testing on my box by doing a full oracle dump and
running some
big java jobs. Well Kswapd now seems to be behaving....(thankfully!!)
When I do a top it shows me
Mem:  8263740K av, 2967608K used, 5296132K free,       0K shrd,    6120K
buff
Swap: 2048248K av,       0K used, 2048248K free                 2530948K
cached
Now the cached part never gets freed and just keeps piling up & so does the
used memory.
On my production box with (kernel 2.4.13), both cached & memory used
keet on increasing till it exhausts the entire physical RAM and the box
falls over.
It just doesn't swap.....(I thought with 8GB RAM I wouldnt need swap)
Anyways, then I updated the bdflush parameters....after that the memory does
get
reclaimed but only by a small percentage, so it hardly made any
difference..Memory still
keeps on piling up...forcing me to reboot the box everyday.
Do I need to make any changes to bdflush, freepages etc in /proc/sys/vm ??
Also, is it normal for linux to just keep on eating memory even though most
of the
processes are sleeping and not reclaim memory till the physical RAM is
exhausted
Once, again I thank you for your response and assistance. I really look
forward to
hearing from you again!!
Best regards,
Anish Srivastava
