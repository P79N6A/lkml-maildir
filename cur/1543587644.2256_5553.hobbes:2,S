Interesting.  I have an ASUS A7V board I'm running an Athlon 900 on with
none of the problems noted here.  Are there specific hardware
correlations that people have noted?  It does have the 686B southbridge
noted in the article as causing problems.
The BIOS thing is interesting though.  I work part time in a computer
repair shop.  With the A7V boards you never know which BIOS version will
be on the board.  The A7V is one of the most popular ones we have for
AMD chips.  We sell a ton of them, so if there are problems I'd sure
like to be kept up to date.
