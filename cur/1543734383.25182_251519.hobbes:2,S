About 2 months ago. The 793 RFC isn't updated instead new ones are added
for the additional features/discoveries.

This is not a TCP flaw, its a combination of poor design by certain
vendors, poor BGP implementation and a lack of understanding of what TCP
does and does not do. See IPSec. TCP gets stuff from A to B in order and
knowing to a resonable degree what arrived. TCP does not proide a
security service.
(The core of this problem arises because certain people treat TCP
connection down on the peering session as link down)

Because packet sizes are finite and not doing so requires an infinite
sequence space and thus infinite packet sizes. Reread the TCP
specifications more carefully, also look at RFC1337 which discusses some
of the real world cases of getting this wrong.
