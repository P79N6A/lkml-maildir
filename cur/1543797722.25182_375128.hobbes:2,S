Dear Kernel Team,
I am facing a strange error after I compiled the Linux kernel-2.6.12(downloaded from kernel.org).
Please see the errors I get when I try to boot the newly built 2.6.12 kernel.
I found lot of members in the groups discussing this and no definite solution is suggestion.
Red Hat nash version 4.1.18 starting
mount: error 19 mounting ext3
ERROR opening /dev/console???: 2
error dup2'ing fd 0 of 0
error dup2'ing fd 0 of 1

Please give your valuable inputs on this? 
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
