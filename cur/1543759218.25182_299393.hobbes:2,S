Umm, yes, I see that one.

But in such case /sys/power/sleep is wrong interface to trigger
this. Imagine system taking short sleeps 10 times a second. You don't
want to trigger that using /sys/power/sleep [because it would switch
your consoles].
But yes, I see the fine line... If it turns display off and waits for
incoming call, yes, there /sys/power/sleep makes sense. Someone get me
Linux phone or tell me where to buy one so I can see the fine points
better ;-).
