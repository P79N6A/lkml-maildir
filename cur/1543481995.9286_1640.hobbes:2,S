We had a promise card that did some amazing things...We finally gave up
and went with SCSI.
First machine: wouldn't boot with card in at all.
Second machine: would boot but stop at POST only if second IDE chain
                attached.
Third machine: worked, but randomly locked up (only with card).
Fourth machine: worked, but ethernet card would only transmit packets
                bigger than 200 bytes (???).
