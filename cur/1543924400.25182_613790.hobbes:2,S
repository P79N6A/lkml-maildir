I guess so: though SLUB wasn't on by default in 2.6.22; and it being
only a slow leak rather than a corruption, I was less inclined to
agitate about it for releases further back.
But your question makes me realize I never even looked at 2.6.23 or
2.6.22 hereabouts, just assumed they were the same; let alone patch
or build or test them.  The patches reject as such because quite a
lot has changed around (there was no struct kmem_cache_cpu in either).
A hurried look suggests that the leakage problem was there in both,
but let's wait to hear Christoph's expert opinion.
