Then I'd prefer a comment. Plus, you don't do (void) on every
xenbus_switch_state, so I have to assume (1) you either forgot to check the
return value or (2) you don't follow your own "on purpose" policy. If you
really want to enforce to use the return value and explicitly not in some
places, then please tag it __must_check.
