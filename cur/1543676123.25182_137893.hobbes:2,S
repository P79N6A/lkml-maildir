"make mrproper" fixes it.
For the record, I think this stinks!
"make mrproper" should  be an expert only utility because it does blow 
away valuable configuration information (a painfull lesson that can 
only be learned "the hard way", since the README neglicts to mention 
this).  For that matter, the README makes it look like creating a 
config from scratch (all 1500+ options) is no big deal!
"make clean; make dep" should have been enough for any config changes 
(it used to be in the past).
