Because we are in micro world now, divisions already replaced by
multiplication. I.e.
        /* DS2760 reports voltage in units of 4.88mV, but the battery class
         * reports in units of uV, so convert by multiplying by 4880. */
        di->voltage_raw = (di->raw[DS2760_VOLTAGE_MSB] << 3) |
                          (di->raw[DS2760_VOLTAGE_LSB] >> 5);
        di->voltage_uV = di->voltage_raw * 4880;
As a side effect, now we're not losing any precision. :-)

By the way. Matt, you're more familiar with ds2760 specs, could you
enlighten me about "* 4" in this snippet?
