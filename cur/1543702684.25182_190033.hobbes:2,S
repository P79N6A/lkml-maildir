hello, 
i use the keyboard mentioned in the topic attached to the ps/2 keyboard port. 
most keys can be mapped using lineak or appropriate applications but i have 
problems getting some keys to work. i tested this with 2.6.0 and 2.6.1 as 
well as with some of the 2.4 series. with wintendo xp, all keys are working 
fine using logitech's itouch software.
xev is not displaying keycodes for the special keys not working but i get 
various messages by dmesg when pressing them:
<-- snip -->
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x91 on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x91 on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x92 on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x92 on isa0060/serio0).
<-- snap -->
on startup, i get the following:
with 2.6.x:

with 2.4.20 & 2.4.22-ck2 the value is increasing from 128 to 511, restarting 
~10 times(!):

if i connect the kb to usb, there are slightly different issues, but let's do 
it step-by-step ;). any ideas how to get this working? if you require 
additional information, just let me know.
if answering, please put me on cc for i'm not subscribed to the list.
keep on rockin, 
sven
