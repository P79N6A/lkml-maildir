Hi,
The patch worked, but on my system, the MP tables are in the low BIOS 
area...
I had a question.  Say we did do paging_init before MP table parsing... how 
do we get access to the high memory addresses for which we dont have any 
translations in the page tables yet?  Should we use something like ioremap 
or kmap?  This is because Linus said the MP tables can be in the HIGH BIOS 
area... so how do we get access to those memory addresses after paging is 
initialized?
Thanks
