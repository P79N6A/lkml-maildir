Yeah they probably whipped it up with some patches.
$ tar --xattrs
tar: unrecognized option `--xattrs'
Try `tar --help' or `tar --usage' for more information.
$ tar --acl
tar: unrecognized option `--acl'
Try `tar --help' or `tar --usage' for more information.
$ rpm -q tar
tar-1.17-21
(Not everything that runs rpm is a fedorahat, though)
