They shouldn't, but maybe some stupid utility or a typo will do it creating 
two incoherent copies of the same block on the device. -> Bad Things can 
happen.
Can't we simply stop people from doing it by say having mount lock the 
device from further opens (and vice versa of course, doing a "dd" should 
result in lock of device preventing a mount during the duration of "dd"). - 
Wouldn't this be a good thing, guaranteeing that problems cannot happen 
while not incurring any overhead except on device open/close? Or is this a 
matter of "give the user enough rope"? - If proper rw locking is 
implemented it could allow simultaneous -o ro mount with a dd from the 
device but do exclusive write locking, for example, for maximum flexibility.
Just my 2p.
