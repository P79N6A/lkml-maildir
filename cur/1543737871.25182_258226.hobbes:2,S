It may need fixing in the sense that it must point out that the Linux kernel
might not conform to POSIX in its handling of select on sockets.
We now not only have "man 2 select", but also "man 3p select".
This is the POSIX text:
       A  descriptor shall be considered ready for reading when a
       call to an input function with O_NONBLOCK clear would  not
       block,  whether  or  not  the function would transfer data
       successfully. (The function might return data, an  end-of-
       file  indication,  or  an  error other than one indicating
       that it is  blocked,  and  in  each  of  these  cases  the
       descriptor shall be considered ready for reading.)
As far as I can interpret these sentences, Linux does not conform.
