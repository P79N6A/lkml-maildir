It was something like this. The real code should be in 2.2.x I believe.
The problem at the time was nested ( recursive ) spinlocks.
typedef struct s_nestlock {
	spinlock_t lock;
	void *uniq;
	atomic_t count;
} nestlock_t;
#define nestlock_init(snl) \
	do { \
		spin_lock_init(&(snl)->lock); \
		(snl)->uniq = NULL; \
		atomic_set(&(snl)->count, 0); \
	} while (0)
#define nestlock_irqlock(snl, flags) \
	do { \
		if ((snl)->uniq == current) { \
			atomic_inc(&(snl)->count); \
			flags = 0; /* No warnings */ \
		} else { \
			spin_lock_irqsave(&(snl)->lock, flags); \
			atomic_inc(&(snl)->count); \
			(snl)->uniq = current; \
		} \
	} while (0)
#define nestlock_irqunlock(snl, flags) \
	do { \
		if (atomic_dec_and_test(&(snl)->count)) { \
			(snl)->uniq = NULL; \
			spin_unlock_irqrestore(&(snl)->lock, flags); \
		} \
	} while (0)
#define nestlock_lock(snl) \
	do { \
		if ((snl)->uniq == current) { \
			atomic_inc(&(snl)->count); \
		} else { \
			spin_lock(&(snl)->lock); \
			atomic_inc(&(snl)->count); \
			(snl)->uniq = current; \
		} \
	} while (0)
#define nestlock_unlock(snl) \
	do { \
		if (atomic_dec_and_test(&(snl)->count)) { \
			(snl)->uniq = NULL; \
			spin_unlock(&(snl)->lock); \
		} \
	} while (0)
