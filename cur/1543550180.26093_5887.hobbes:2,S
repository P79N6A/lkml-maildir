This is why I want to do:
1) equal aging of all pages in the system
2) page aging to have properties of both LRU and LFU
3) drop-behind to cope with streaming IO in a good way
and maybe:
4) move unmapped pages to the inactive_clean list for
   immediate reclaiming but put pages which are/were
   mapped on the inactive_dirty list so we keep it a
   little bit longer
The only way to reliably know if the cache is re-used a
lot is by making sure we do the page aging for unmapped
and mapped pages the same. If we don't do that, we won't
be able to make a sensible comparison between the activity
of pages in different places.
regards,
Rik
