	I've also developed a patch (posted just now to lkml), that
does nearly the same thing for the 2.4.x series kernels. The
major difference is that I use a PPM file (and have a conversion
utility in linux/scripts/ called ppmtolinuxlogo.c), and mine
can be configured out of the kernel from a Config.in.
	Please feel free to rip out the ppmtolinuxlogo.c and put it
in your patch, if you would like. Also, you may want to look at
the Makefile dependencies and Config.in/Configure.help changes
to improve your patch.
	I also have a 2.2.x version of my patch, but I can forward
you that in private email if you would like. Very little changed.
