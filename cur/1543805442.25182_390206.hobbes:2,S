This one contains statistics about perfmon such as PMU model, number of active
sessions, and also a bunch of per-cpu statistics (see attached file).

This one contains PMU register mapping information. On My laptop, it shows:
% cat /proc/perfmon_map
PMC0:0x100000:0xffcfffff:PERFSEL0
PMC1:0x100000:0xffcfffff:PERFSEL1
PMD0:0x0:0xffffffffffffffff:PERFCTR0
PMD1:0x0:0xffffffffffffffff:PERFCTR1

One integer value per file.

Yes, that should be fairly easy.

Well, /proc/perfmon does expose per-cpu stats.
