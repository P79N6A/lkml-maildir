Hi.
With latest 2.4.6-ac2, my lo interface setup looks like broken.
Initscripts use /sbin/ip (it is a Mandrake Cooker box) to query the interface,
and it only gets 'refused connections'. I think it worked with previous
kernels.
This is an strace of the problem:
werewolf:~# strace ip -o link
...
socket(PF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW, 0)         = 3
bind(3, {sin_family=AF_NETLINK, {sa_family=16, sa_data="\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\353\215\5\10"}, 12) = 0
getsockname(3, {sin_family=AF_NETLINK, {sa_family=16, sa_data="\0\0\215\17\0\0\0\0\0\0\353\215\5\10"}, [12]) = 0
time(NULL)                              = 994752488
sendto(3, "\24\0\0\0\22\0\1\3\351\267J;\0\0\0\0\21\362\5\10", 20, 0, {sin_family=AF_NETLINK, {sa_family=16, sa_data="\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0`d\5\10"}, 12) = -1 ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused)
write(2, "Cannot send dump request: Connec"..., 45Cannot send dump request: Connection refused
) = 45
_exit(1)                                = ?
I saw that NETLINK support has changed a bit in ac series:
Netlink device emulation
CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV
  This option will be removed soon. Any programs that want to use
  character special nodes like /dev/tap0 or /dev/route (all with major
  number 36) need this option, and need to be rewritten soon to use
  the real netlink socket.
  This is a backward compatibility option, choose Y for now.
I have activated it, but nothing changes. Any idea ?
Thanks.
