Three possibilities:
1) gcc -S file.c (creates file.s)
2) gdb
3) objdump --disassemble
gcc -S is probably the easiest to work with, as it still contains labels
and other information that is basically stripped or transformed by the
assembler.  Note that all three use AT&T assembly syntax.  If you are
used to Intel syntax then there will be a bit of a learning curve (src
and dest operands are reversed and pointers are handled differently),
but IMHO AT&T syntax is more intuitive and _much_ easier to read than
Intel's syntax.
