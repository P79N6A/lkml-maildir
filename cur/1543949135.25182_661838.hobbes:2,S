I'm puzzled at how to explain this...
The whole details have been explained over and over during the discussion.
The simple answer is that CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST has been causing extra clock 
drift, John's attempt didn't fix the real cause.
My patch doesn't just revert the patches, it also includes the _real_ fix, 
so why would the real fix require more justification? That person also 
didn't get puzzled why two patches claiming to fix the same problem got 
merged...
bye, Roman
