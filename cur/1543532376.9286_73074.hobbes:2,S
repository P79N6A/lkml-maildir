[snipped a number of Q&A]
Thanks for your previous answers, now I have a couple more questions:
Which is the proper way of dealing with multifunction devices?
(I'm talking about a sound card with a joystick port)
Right now the driver searches for two independent devices which works
ok except for the fact that I need to make some connection between joystick
and sound card (I need to access the sound card pci_dev->driver_data from the
joystick
initialization routine). I could always look for another device on the same
slot but who guarantees this has already been initialized?
The pci device layout is (lspci -vv):
00:13.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! (rev 04)
	Subsystem: Unknown device 1102:0020
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 19
	I/O ports at ef40
	Capabilities: <available only to root>
00:13.1 Input device controller: Creative Labs SB Live! Daughterboard (rev 01)
	Subsystem: Unknown device 1102:0020
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64
	I/O ports at eff0
	Capabilities: <available only to root>
