This would be great. I always hated the recursive make loop, which forced
me to use -j4 simply to get make do its job faster although there are
often only a few files to be recompiled. If Make had complete information
about all files that would work much faster.

I think that is a good assumption. People trying to build Linux with
non-GNU make deserve to lose @)

I would be very interested in it (although I'm not sure if I count as a guru..)
It is probably worth to keep the ar archive building set to make sure
that no unnecessary code is linked in. 
Of course it is currently too late for 2.2, but I think it would be a very
useful addition early in the 2.3 cycle.
