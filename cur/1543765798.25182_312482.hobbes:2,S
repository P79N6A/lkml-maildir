Yes, you should be able to reset the channel here, since at that point
it's been closed.

Yes, flush_scheduled_work() should probably be called from
__relay_reset() - thanks for catching this and suggesting the fix.
BTW, I've updated the old relayfs patch with your previous fixes and
ported it to 2.6.11 - it hasn't appeared yet on the opersys website,
so let me know if you want it and I'll send it, or I can just send you
a new version after I make these changes...

I'll take a look at this too - looks like there might be a potential
problem if a channel was closed while a resize was in progress.  I
don't think anyone's ever actually used resizing, but it should be
fixed nonetheless.
Thanks,
Tom
