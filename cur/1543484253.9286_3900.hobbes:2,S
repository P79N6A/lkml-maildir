  Hi, all. Version 5 of my msr patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
Some documentation is also available here.
The patch provides user space access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
and Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) via device driver interfaces.
The patch also includes a crude page colouring algorithm (off by
default) and improvements for the MTRR interface.
This is against 2.2.0+devfs. Highlights of this release:
- Added fix to page colouring support when L2 cache size on boot CPU
  is reported as zero: assume 256 kB L2 cache (avoids divide Oops)
- Added Cyrix 6x86MX/MII support for /dev/cpu/perfmon# devices
  Thanks to Jan Bernard van Doorn <mountpoint@cable.a2000.nl>
- Added Cyrix emulation of MTRRs using ARRs
  Thanks to Zoltan Boszormenyi <zboszor@mol.hu>
				Regards,
					Richard....
