Hi
commit to .24 tree:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=93b1eab3d29e7ea32ee583de3362da84db06ded8
introduces:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(pv_mmu_ops);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(pv_cpu_ops);
pv_cpu_ops is for nvidia
pv_mmu_ops' is for amd(ati)
which will break 32bit systems with paravirt enabled and trying to compile
the binary graphic drivers from amd(ati) and nvidia.
is there a chance to see these symbols not exported as GPL?
Or do they have to change their binary drivers?
thanks in advance
greetings
tpowa
