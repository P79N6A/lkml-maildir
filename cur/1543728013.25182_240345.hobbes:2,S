Which dependencies? select was more intended to select symbols without a 
prompt (it's dependency would be simply 'n'). The selected symbol can also 
have multiple prompts, how should these dependencies be merged?
The current select is intentionally simple, so the calculation is 
straightforward. Anything more complex I have to completely rethink the 
behaviour between depencies and selects, e.g. something like this:
	A ---selects----> C ---selects----> D
	B --depends on-->   --depends on--> E
If you want to change the behaviour of select how will it change the 
behaviour of the other dependencies and selects?
I have some ideas for that, but I didn't had the time yet to sit down and 
completely think it through and a few other changes are more important.
bye, Roman
