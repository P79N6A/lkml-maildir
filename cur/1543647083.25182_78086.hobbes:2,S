Just a short note, since I have gotta run: The latter won't work very well 
with modules, since obviously ->release() has to MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT, to 
avoid having ->release() unloaded before it's executed. So for one, that's 
a DoS making delaying module unload indefinitely by keep /driversfs/... 
open, but even worse, rmmod will refuse to unload the module, since the 
use count is > zero. 
That's because normally pci_unregister_driver() or whatever is called in
cleanup_module(), but obviously to be able to call it the refcount has to 
be zero already...
