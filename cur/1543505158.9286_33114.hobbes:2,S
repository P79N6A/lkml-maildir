whew. Glad to hear that.
This is also an example of why things that could go in the bootloader
shouldn't.
Simple wins. 
The whole kernel commandline thing has always struck me as odd.
"Programming in the large" isn't the same for a kernel. The kernel doesn't
have a main(), why should it have argv/argc ? It seems to me that the
kernel could ask for parameters, or rdev could be generalized, or both.
As I said before, something like this is a net simplification, although it
complicates the kernel.
