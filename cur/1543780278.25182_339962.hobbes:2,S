IMHO you really need then to make acpi_specific_hotkey the default or at
least mention it in the release notes or you'll have tons of people
screaming that the specific module does not work anymore.
I found out about it after my toshiba_acpi module stopped working and I
noticed a small change in the development acpi tree documentation
mentioning acpi_specific_hotkey ...
