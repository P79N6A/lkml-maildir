I am not sure about that. init_timer() initializes timer->base
and timer_pending() checks for base == NULL. So, it is illegal
to do timer_pending(), mod_timer() and del_timer*() without an
init_timer() or an add_timer() earlier. But then, I presume this
was a requirement in the earlier timer interfaces too. No ?
Thanks
