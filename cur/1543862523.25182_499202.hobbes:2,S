that's a really hard question since it's dynamic;
I suppose a good rule of thumb is "never expect more than 16Mb to work"
(when I said "64Mb" that was for the kernel as a whole, and there's
other users than just "you" :)
if you need that much you probably should redesign your algorithms to
not need vmalloc in the first place....
