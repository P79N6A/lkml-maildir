Hi,
  if we are talking about endianess, I have one related small
question: in variable of which type I should store return 
value from ioremap() ? I browsed all sources and I found that:
    ioremap() returns 'void*' on all archs
    check_signature() wants to obtain 'unsigned long' on all
      archs
    readb() casts its parameter (sometime to ul, sometime to
      void*); only sparc wants 'unsigned long'
    __raw_readb() exist only on Alpha. Wants unsigned long...
    memset_io() wants 'void*' on sparc64, others do casts
  Different drivers use 'unsigned long' or 'void*', probably
authors randomly selected one of usual types.
  Any idea? If some archs (Alpha) preffers 'unsigned long', 
but others (sparc64 (and me, but I'm not 'arch')) 'void*', we 
should define some new type... Or change definitions of
sparc64 or Alpha. It is really confusing if you must pass
unsigned long to check_signature, but void* to memset_io,
because of otherwise it will complain on some (PCI capable) 
archs...
