Be very careful if distributing your driver in two parts -- a GPL'd part
and a part which you claim is not affected by the GPL.
If your non-GPL'd section is an independent and separate work in itself,
then the GPL doesn't apply to it when it is distributed as a separate
work.
But if you distribute that same section as part of a whole which _is_
based on the kernel, then the distribution of the whole must be on the
terms of the GPL. The GPL extends to the entire whole; to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it.
The intent of the GPL is to control the distribution of collective works
based on the Program; not just derived works.
You _really_ should consult a lawyer and make sure the final paragraphs
of §2 are taken into full consideration.
