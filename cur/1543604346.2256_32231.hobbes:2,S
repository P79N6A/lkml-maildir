With CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG on?
Slab debugging is not compatible with HIGHMEM=64G as-is, I think (and we
didn't use to expose that CONFIG option to normal users until recently).
Th ebug is in get_pgd_slow() in include/asm-i386/pgalloc.h, where it just
does a "kmalloc()" and expects the thing to be magically aligned.
Does anybody have (tested) patches for this?
