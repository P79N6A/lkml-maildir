To my unpracticed eye this one looks fairly fundamental.  Unfortunately the
changelog:
  Add a single-thread workqueue for each mapped device and move flushing
  of the lists of pushback and deferred bios to this new workqueue.
tells us nothing of the reasons for this change.  (It should have done so!)
It _looks_ pretty unscalable.  Perhaps these deferred BIOs don't happen
very often?
