It'll be really "nice" to have. Currently all the production systems
simply shutdown all databases and applications and put systems to a
halt. But, I'm thinking of implementing suspend_to_disk instead of
shutdown the database and applications, so when power resumes, the
system can carry on where it was left off. Nice, very nice feature to
have.
It's "nice" because nobody has tried, and if this works, I don't see
why not use it for all machines in a data center.
The DELL 2950 has 16GB of RAM, and will be running oracle database.
