Both igb (recently posted) and ixgbe (also recently posted) support both
MSI and MSI-X.  Right now when we try to request MSI-X vectors, if we
fail to acquire what we've asked for, we fall back to MSI support.  If
MSI fails to initialize, we fall back to legacy interrupts.  So it needs
to be there in case MSI-X allocation fails for the NIC driver.
