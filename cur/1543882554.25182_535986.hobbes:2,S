It seems a bit out-of-date. Here is the output:
build-i386-sony-tx770p$ make
scripts/kconfig/conf -s arch/i386/Kconfig
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CC [M]  drivers/misc/tifm_core.o
  CC [M]  drivers/misc/tifm_7xx1.o
  CC [M]  drivers/mmc/tifm_sd.o
drivers/mmc/tifm_sd.c: In function ‘tifm_sd_probe’:
drivers/mmc/tifm_sd.c:987: error: ‘struct mmc_host’ has no member named 
‘max_sectors’
make[2]: *** [drivers/mmc/tifm_sd.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/mmc] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
This is with v2.6.21 and your tarball unpacked like this:
linux/tifm.h -> include/linux/tifm.h
tifm_sd.c -> drivers/mmc/tifm_sd.c
tifm_7xx1.c -> drivers/misc/tifm_7xx1.c
tifm_core.c -> drivers/misc/tifm_core.c
I will look in mm and write back.
