The POSIX tests are good for regression testing not necessarily for
stress testing, obviously both are important. The person to talk to
about this is Chris Yeoh <cyeoh@linuxcare.com.au>.

Yes for example I have a set of scripts I use to test software raid,
loopback, ramdisk etc for sparc because there is a tendency for these
things to break and not get found until long afterwards.
