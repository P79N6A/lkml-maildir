I just replaced my memory chips. They had tested them before sending them
out and said that they'd checked out perfect, but running a quick test on
some unused pages shows up errors:

Now I'm fucking pissed off. Linux seems to boot just fine so I'm
suspecting another problem somewhere. Any ideas? I've checked the IDE
cables and they seem fine.
