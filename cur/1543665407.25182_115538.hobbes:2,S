There's a shitload of patches in the 2.4 commit archives that
mostly still apply. With each iteration of spelling fixes,
it becomes more and more work to weed through these to find
out if things are really applied or not.  In the beginning I
used Rusty's 'isapplied' script. Its now pretty much useless,
requiring manual inspection of code on every diff.
Spelling fixes aren't going to get us to 2.6.0 any faster.
There are _dozens_ of known problems, and I'll take patches
fixing real problems over spelling fixes any day.
