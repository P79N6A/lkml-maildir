I discovered I was looking in the wrong place - not being very
familiar with git terminology.
I found them and it looks right.
I had a bit of a look at removing bio_data and ->buffer ...  the
usages outside of drivers/ide are fairly easy to deal with - I might
send a patch for that.  The drivers/ide stuff looks like a fairly
substantial rewrite is in order.
e.g.  idefloppy_packet_command_s seems to duplicate a lot of 
  fields from 'struct request', and it should probably use the request
  struct directly.
But a number of times ->buffer points to ->cmd, and there is no bio.
I guess we should use bio_map_kern to make a bio?
I'll see if I can come up with something.... testing it might be
awkward.  I have an ide cdrom I can test on.  Maybe an ide disk,, but
not an ide floppy :-)
