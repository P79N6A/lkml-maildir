I'm not sure what races you're referring to, but never mind. :-)
This is the reason why the freezer waits for tasks to freeze, actually.

This is what the freezer does, isn't it? ;-)

Well, can't we do:
 	drivers_sysfs_write()
		while(!suspend_trylock())
			try_to_icebox() --> or even try_to_freeze(), what's the difference?
 		hit hardware
		unlock_suspend()
where the PM core must wait for the suspend lock to get released (say with a
timeout)?

Hmm, perhaps we can use a special workqueue that's created before the suspend
(say by the PM core) and starts processing jobs after the resume?
