Besides these two, I think there are two more race conditions with
journal_try_to_free_buffers() inside
journal_commit_transaction()->journal_submit_data_buffers()
3) when journal_submit_data_buffers() saw the buffer is dirty but failed
to lock the buffer bh1, journal_submit_data_buffers() released the
j_list_lock and submit other buffers collected from previous check, with
the reference to bh1 still hold. During this time
journal_try_to_free_buffers() could clean up the journal head of bh1 and
remove it from the t_syncdata_list. Then try_to_free_buffers() would
fail because the reference held by journal_submit_data_buffers()
...
		if (buffer_dirty(bh)) {
                       if (test_set_buffer_locked(bh)) {
                                BUFFER_TRACE(bh, "needs blocking lock");
                                spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);
					<-- here release the j_list_lock without put(bh)
                                            journal_try_to_free_buffers() could come in and remove this bh from t_syncdata_list
                                /* Write out all data to prevent deadlocks */
                                journal_do_submit_data(wbuf, bufs);
                                bufs = 0;
                                lock_buffer(bh);
                                spin_lock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                                        <-- here continue the check without validate if the bh still on t_sycdata_list
                        }
                        locked = 1;
                }
4) when journal_commit_transaction() go through the t_locked_list and
wait for the buffer to be unlocked, it still holds the reference to the
buffer, released the j_list_lock and gives the
journal_try_to_free_buffers() a chance to come in remove this buffer
from t_locked_list, but journal_commit_transaction() continues as if the
buffer still on the locked list.
      while (commit_transaction->t_locked_list) {
                struct buffer_head *bh;
                jh = commit_transaction->t_locked_list->b_tprev;
                bh = jh2bh(jh);
                get_bh(bh);
                if (buffer_locked(bh)) {
                        spin_unlock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                        wait_on_buffer(bh);
                        if (unlikely(!buffer_uptodate(bh)))
                                err = -EIO;
                        spin_lock(&journal->j_list_lock);
                }
