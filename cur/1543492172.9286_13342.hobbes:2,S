this can be done via an existing variable, kstat.ctxsw, no need to add yet
another 'have we scheduled' flag. But the whole approach is quite flawed
and volatile, it simply relies on us having the big kernel lock. With more
finegrained SMP locking in that area we will have big problems preserving
that solution.
