Interesting idea.  Are you imagining this instrumented copy being
built at kernel compile time (something like building a "-g -O0"
parallel)?  Or compiled anew from original sources after deployment?
Or on-the-fly binary-level rewriting a la SPIN?

None of the three above are that easy.  Do you have an implementation
idea?
