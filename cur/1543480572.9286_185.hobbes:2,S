Except that I've also gotten email for saying "Linux" kernel when ~it
was technically correct but nevertheless would not have hurt" to say
'GNU/Linux.'~ Believe me, folks, I appreciate the difference and I
appreciate the politics, so let's avoid this topic as it is a sore spot.

Yes, but we're talking about checkpoint migration of CPU and I/O
intensive jobs to boxes that have free CPU resources. ptrace() will slow
things down significantly. At least, that was my experience on the Cray
Y-MP running Cray UNICOS, where the delay from ptrace() was VERY
noticeable. With GNU/Linux, err, Linux kernel, err GNU/Linux, it is
significantly less noticeable but still there, I'll bet.

So, help us add checkpoint migration facilities to GNU Queue. You can
throw in your ptrace facility for free.
