That's strange, I guess different chipsets 'chew' up different amounts of 
memory OR you have your DVT(?) (video-card memory/aperature) set to 256MB? 
I have mine set to 128MB, in top:
Mem:   8039576k total,  6187304k used,  1852272k free,      696k buffers
What type of memory are you using and what is your DVT set to?
Justin.
