Good point , you got on your dmesg of kernel 2.6.18-rc6

USB Universal Host Controller Interface driver v3.0
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:11.2[D] -> Link [LNKD] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
PCI: VIA IRQ fixup for 0000:00:11.2, from 9 to 11
uhci_hcd 0000:00:11.2: UHCI Host Controller
uhci_hcd 0000:00:11.2: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
uhci_hcd 0000:00:11.2: irq 11, io base 0x00009800
usb usb1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
hub 1-0:1.0: USB hub found
hub 1-0:1.0: 2 ports detected
but before 
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKA] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 *11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKB] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 9 *10 11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKC] (IRQs 3 4 *5 6 7 9 10 11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 *9 10 11 12 14 15)
LNKD was on 9, so may be the bug is on ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 11
you have to investigate :) 
Further more, your interrupts have 4 steps  
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:11.2[D] -> Link [LNKD] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
and mine just got 3 
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:10.1[A] -> GSI 21 (level, low) -> IRQ 201
