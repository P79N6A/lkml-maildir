Changing vectors on the fly is hard on some platforms.... We could
change our toplevel ppc_md.get_irq() on powerpc, but we still to do
something about decrementer interrupts.
A screaming level interrupt will lockup the machine at least on some
platforms.
The problem with all those approaches is that they require changes to
all archs interrupt handling to make the situation safe vs. mutexes...
I still don't think where is the suckage in just not hard-enabling in
the mutex debug code...
Ben.
