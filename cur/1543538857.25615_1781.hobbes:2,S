I disagree here. If you enumerate things, you have zero or more
of them. _Never_ owe you (as the kernel) somebody a soundcard ;-)
So fix is:
   signed long ret = register_sound_dsp(&emu10k1_audio_fops, -1);
   if (ret < 0) {
      /* Error handling or jump to it */
   } else {
      card->audio1_num = ret;
   };
This is _always_ the safe variant, when you like to indicate
errors as negative values, but positive values as the "real"
return values.
Otherwise you have to check for "< 0" every time you look at the
signed variable (if you are a clean coder ;-)).
