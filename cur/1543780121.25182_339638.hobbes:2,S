Actually, I'm glad you asked that question because I was wondering that
myself.  The devices are added to the list at boot time, and after that
time, the list will never change.  Does PCI enumeration happen on all
processors?  I thought maybe it only happened on one.  In that case we
don't need a lock I don't think.
