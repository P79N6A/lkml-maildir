Glibc has to use signals because there *still* is not mechanism in the
kernel to allow synchronization.  After how many years.
I don't blame Linux.  He has no interest in threads and therefore
spends not much time thinking about it.  But everybody who's
complaining about things like this has to be willing to fix the real
problems.
Get your ass up and write a fast semaphore/mutex system.
