Hello.
I have a question on pci hotplug capability.
when a new device is inserted, the hotplug driver enumerates pci, and if the
driver is already loaded....
for each new device
	pci_insert->pci_announce->pci_probe
if i need to remove a device, the pci_remove would be called, but it does
not call to check if the device is ready for removal. If there are other
apps working on this device, how would the hotplug removal be authenticated
before removal?
pci_remove() has no return value, means it cannot fail....
