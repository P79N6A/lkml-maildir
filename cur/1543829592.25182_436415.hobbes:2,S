It was due to a loop in fill_tgid() when per-TG stats
data are assembled for netlink:
        do {
                rc = delayacct_add_tsk(stats, tsk);
                if (rc)
                        break;
        } while_each_thread(first, tsk);
and it is executed inside a lock.
Fortunately single threaded appls do not hit this code.
