Doesn't seem like a software pb to me...
Are the 2 PCs grounded ?
If you own a voltmeter, remove the serial link and try measuring the 
tension between the ground pins of the 2 serial interfaces you use for 
your serial link. If my guess is right your IBM (or its serial port) is 
not correctly grounded and might act like an accumulator that discharges 
itself when the other PC is switched on !

99,9% chances of an hardware problem.
