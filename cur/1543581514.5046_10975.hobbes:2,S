Alan> What is the oops data before the kernel panic. I need that to debug the

My system compiler is:
   gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
Shoud I upgrade it to gcc 2.95.x or 2.96.x?
And since my last post 2.4.1-ac8 crashed again with:
    kswapd: Cannot dereference NULL pointer.
On the next crash I'll try write down all traces.
BTW, is there some way to log it somewhere to file?
