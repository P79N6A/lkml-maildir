I think you need to give more thought to device-mapper
interactions here.  If an underlying device is suspended
by device-mapper without freezing the filesystem (the
normal state) and you issue a freeze_bdev on a device
above it, the freeze_bdev may never return if it attempts
any synchronous I/O (as it should).
Try:
  while process generating I/O to filesystem on LVM
  issue dmsetup suspend --nolockfs (which the lvm2 tools often do)
  try your freeze_filesystems()
Maybe: don't allow freeze_filesystems() to run when the system is in that
state; or, use device-mapper suspend instead of freeze_bdev directly where
dm is involved; or skip dm devices that are already frozen - all with
appropriate dependency tracking to process devices in the right order.
