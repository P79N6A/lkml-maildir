When it was enabled to be supported by e1000e.

82573E/L are PCIe devices only, don't let the use of "PCI configuration
space" confuse you.  All PCIe devices support PCI configuration space.
This allows systems with PCIe to work right (or mostly right) with all
the PCI supporting software like Linux.

E1000e is targeted at the PCIe devices only.

Unfortunate bit of confusion over terminology.

Hope this helped,
