OK found the problem.  Looks like the ALSA folks have the hooks in there
for the iomem changes but it is currently a NOOP.  In
alsa-driver/configure:
   6632 #define CONFIG_OLD_REMAP_PAGE_RANGE 1
Then:
   6569 echo "$as_me:$LINENO: checking for new remap_page_range" >&5
   6570 echo $ECHO_N "checking for new remap_page_range... $ECHO_C" >&6
For now unset CONFIG_OLD_REMAP_PAGE_RANGE and it should work.  Not yet
tested.
