Hi,
I compiled everything (kernel and modules) with -g, used the latest
/proc/kcore (see patch 
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/kcore
),
used "add-symbol-file /lib/modules/2.3.27/fs/bfs.o addr", where addr is
the address of text (found via ksymoops -s map < /dev/null) and tried to
use "info scope bfs_read_super" and .... it didn't work. It works fine for
functions statically linked into the kernel but not for modules. Any idea
why?
Regards
