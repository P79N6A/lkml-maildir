Yep. I can reword it in terms of pages, if that helps. Boxes with 8k
pages tend to have larger instruction words and data structures by
virtue of being RISC/64bit/etc., so I think 1000 pages is a reasonable
number in either case.

Basically, the numfreepages approach doesn't take into account the
size of the kernel/critical userspace at all. So we assume that
anything less than 4M is already tight and that we're not yet in a
position to trade space for performance, so lets just pull that off the top.
Longer term, I think some serious thought needs to go into scaling
hash sizes across the board, but this serves my purposes on the
low-end without changing behaviour asymptotically.
