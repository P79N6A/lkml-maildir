Yeah, but he is right in any case - look how the IDE mess of 2.5.x, which, frankly, I don't believe was ever as bad as people seem to be saying it was, has put people off testing 2.5.x.  Instead they are waiting for Linus to type
mv linux-2.5.x linux-2.6.0
at which point they think that all remaining bugs will auto-magically correct themselves and the tree is one again safe to use.  WRONG answer!
Simply from the point of view of not wanting to 'scare off' people from a whole tree, (which is so rediculous, I think I'll go and patent it), and as a result get less testing, we're better off trying to stop weirdness from getting in.
John.
