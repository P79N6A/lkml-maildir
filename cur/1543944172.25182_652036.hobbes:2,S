Andrew seems to already have picked up the patch in -mm (I received an
e-mail + x86-configurable-dmi-scanning-code.patch added to -mm tree).
If I resend a new one with proper credits, will Andrew pick it up and
replace the old version by the new version ?

I was compiling with 4.2.3, which I suppose is a modern gcc.
