Andy asked me to do the following without ppp, which I did.
The explanation of the odd key is in his previous mail.
#!/bin/sh
x=0
while true; do
        bk clone -qlr40514130hBbvgP4CvwEVEu27oxm46w testing-2.6 foo
        (cd foo; bk pull -q)
        rm -rf foo
        x=`expr $x + 1`
        echo -n "$x "
done
The above caused a failure after the 7th iteration or so.  This time, the
RESYNC/SCCS/s.ChangeSet file didn't have any nulls, but three other
files did, namely s.Makefile, s.CREDITS, s.MAINTAINERS.  Not knowing
whether this was normal or not, I've sent those files to bitkeeper for
analysis.
Since I only began seeing these "Assertion `s && s->tree' failed" problems
with bk in the past month or so, and I generally run a current kernel
on this machine, I booted an older kernel, 2.6.3.  I'm going to run
Andy's test overnight and see if 2.6.3 acts any differently.
In the meantime, I'll have the machine building a 2.6.6-plus kernel
with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB if its
use seems indicated in the morning.
