tchk is the same thing pretty much with output disabled.  There's a HTML
copy of the man page here:
  
http://www.penguin-soft.com/penguin/man/1/tendracc.html
It's packaged for Debian and therefore Ubuntu and other derived
distributions.

You just need to specify -Ysystem (or some other API selection option)
when building to get it to accept long long.  Since TenDRA focuses on
strict standards conformance it defaults to something roughly equivalent
to GCC with -std=c89 -pedantic -Werror and requires the user to
explicitly enable support for any other APIs and features they want to
use.

The compiler is solid enough but old - it predates C99 and has had no
real development since then beyond updating the system include overrides
to work with newer glibc versions.
