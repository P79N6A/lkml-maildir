still the low speed devices are giving unlink after no IRQ.. My
hardware engineer says he followed the reference schematics of ISP1562
of philips. He says that ohci side, the power lines are wired up
My Ehci devices can be mounted and the files are read
Today I faced another issue
For some usb ehci devices its giving "device descriptor read/64, error
-71" ( for some usb stick of usb2.0)
but for others i can able to mount without this error.....
Sir, Any clue regarding the above problem iam facing currently ??
Thanks
