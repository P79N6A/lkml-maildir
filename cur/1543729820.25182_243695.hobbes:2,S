SG_IO prior to 2.6.8 doesn't do any checks on any path into and through
the IDE driver. Thus I sent Linus a patch for 2.6.8 that just added
capable(CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to the raw command path.
Filtering was something Jens and I were talking about. I was a little
suprised when Linus added filters just before release. We do now have
good traces of what various apps want. Some of those commands may be
problematic without sg_io knowing the target class however.

Possibly. Vendor commands are not in themselves a problems. The answer
to those is "no" 8)
