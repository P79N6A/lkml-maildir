I found that after the deletion I occasionally (say one time in three or four), saw block reads a little over 30000 KB/sec.  I then tried running bonnie from "/" rather than from a subdirectory.  The result is block reads of better than 30000 KB/sec every time - the record is 37558.  Maybe I should have knowm to run it from root.
Keep in mind that drives have different transfer rates depending on where on the drive you read from.
