I only measured about 32k for decompression.  But that was using
the variant from gzip via the kernel.
The really small algorithm I know about (at least for decompression)
is upx.  The compression is comparable with gzip with a decompressor
that can fit in a page or two of assembly code.
Probably irrelevant at this juncture but...
