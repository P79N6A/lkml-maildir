No, it's intended. Internally, I use the name 'sr' for a SCSI CDrom as
that's the name the driver advertises. Some strange distributions out there
seem to prefer the name 'scd' for unknown reasons[*], that's why I map scd to
sr in order not to confuse users.
[*] The file name of the driver is sr.c, the module is name sr_mod, it fills
in  the tag 'sr' as driver name (which is reported in /proc/devices).
But for some reason somebody thinks that 'scd' would be more user friendly.
It may seem more intuitive at first sight, but it makes things completely
inconsistent. Unless, of course, we rename everything to 'scd' to make it
consistent again.
It nowadays is even reported as 'scd' (and 'sr' deprecated) in devices.txt,
sigh! 
Somebody should take an authorative decision and do the renames if necessary!
Or make sure devices.txt is fixed. Jens?
Regards,
