Well, it's up to you.  You *could* implement:
#define call_security(method , ...)					\
	({ int __ret;							\
	   if (try_module_get(security_ops->owner)) {			\
		__ret = security_ops->method(__VA_ARGS__);		\
		module_put(security_ops->owner);			\
	   } else							\
		/* If unloading or loading, default to "allow" */	\
		__ret = 0;						\
	  __ret;							\
	})
Now, if you don't have CONFIG_MODULES this becomes the code as it is
now.  If you don't have CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD, this becomes:
	if (security_ops->owner && security_ops->owner->live)
		__ret = security_ops->method(__VA_ARGS__);
	else
		__ret = 0;
With the case of CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD, it looks *really* horrible (53
instructions with 6 branches: ewww...).  So I would recommend
register_security insert a shim and take the hit itself:
#ifdef CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD
	if (ops->owner) {
		module_ops->real = ops;
		ops = module_ops;
	}
#endif
Then module_ops does the inc/dec wrappers (well, it can optimize if
the ops can't sleep...).
