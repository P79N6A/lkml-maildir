That sounds like a bug. Make sure you ACPI off for x440 if you are
testing and see if that helps
For vendor kernels you need Red Hat AS 2.1 or UnitedLinux 1.0. At least
I don't believe other vendors rolled kernels for x440 but I may be wrong
about that - certainly I can believe Debian or Gentoo might have.
x440 is sufficiently weird it needs its own extras and that makes it
hard to support for vendors.
