I'm not happy with the `CONFIG_ISA means ISA slots' logic, neither. For e.g.
PC-style floppy, it means `we have a (possibly burried withing PCI) ISA-style
bus'.
Furthermore, on some m68k machines we do have an ISA-style bus, but without
ISA-style DMA. This causes more drivers to fail compilation, giving me
headaches when trying to compile an all-yes-config kernel for m68k. I guess
other architectures are faced with the same problems.
Well, I guess I have to try the new drivers/Kconfig first and elaborate with a
list of drivers that failed and why they failed...
