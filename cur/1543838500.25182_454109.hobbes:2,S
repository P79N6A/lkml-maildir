Though in this situation, you don't usually have slow writeback problems.
I haven't seen any recent problems with insufficient throttling on this
sort of configuration.

CFQ still has a queue depth of 128 requests....

balance_dirty_pages() already kicks the background writeback done
by pdflush when dirty > dirty_background_ratio (10%).
IMO, if you've got slow writeback, you should be reducing the amount
of dirty memory you allow in the machine so that you don't tie up
large amounts of memory that takes a long time to clean. Throttle earlier
and you avoid this problem entirely.
Cheers,
