We already _have_ a lot of common code in drivers/pci, but it's not
compiled in for x86 or ia64.  some other architectures don't assign PCI
resources in the `BIOS' so we get to do it.  setup-bus.c, setup-res.c
and setup-irq.c all seem to duplicate some part of the code currently
found in each and every hotplug driver.
