Data, not at file-scope, means data like this:
	int foo()
        {
            static int bar = 0;
        }
Bar is private to function foo(). It does not have file-scope.
However, it is static and therefore is expected to persist over
multiple calls to foo. It, therefore, does not exist on the
stack as local data. Instead, it is normally put in ".bss" or
".data" depending upon initialization.
If you want this data to go away after initialization, you
declare it as:
            static int bar __initdata = 0;;
Any data you want to go away after initialization, including
file-scope data, can get the __initdata attribute. FYI, this
puts the data in a special segment that gets freed after
initialization. The idea is to save RAM.
