OK, I'm not sure whether this part is really useful or not, so I'll
remove this.
Also, for improving this patch overall, I'd like to hear feedback from
real user of hotplug devices.

I didn't trigger this on my test. However queue->nr_requests is
configurable (/sys/block/xxx/queue/nr_requests), so if user changes
it, I guess it may be triggered.
But also I don't know whether it is useful or not.
Thanks.
