This patch makes things much worse, i'd categorize it as severe regression
compared to cfs 7. It makes the cursor in X stutter enormously, it even 
caused my entire X to lock up for a second, and events like keyboard input is 
totally wrecked, it lagged as i wrote in xchat. as for under load, it seems 
only worse..
Also if i just press a link in konqueror on some website, while it loads, the 
mouse is stuttering untill the page has loaded finished.
this seems weird because its such a relatively simple patch.
In the patchs defense, gtk seems to redraw faster (when, and only when 3d is 
NOT running)
i also discovered another thing about cfs 7 (without this patch), which is 
same behavior as old staircase/vanilla, but which SD actually fixes.
this is a wine case, where when it loads a level in world of warcraft, the 
audio skips. I believe this to be a problem in wine, however, in sd it 
actually does not skip. On the desktop however, the audio issues were totally 
fixed in v7..
mvh.
