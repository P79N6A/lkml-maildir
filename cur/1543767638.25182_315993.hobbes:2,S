My Powerbook 3400 I got on Ebay for $100 works great with linux, except 
that the sound driver which worked in 2.6.8 now oopses on modprobe in 
both 2.6.12-rc3 and 2.6.12-rc3-mm2. The oops looks like this:

I can do a binary search of the versions between 2.6.8 and 2.6.12-rc3 to 
see when it broke if that will help.
Config and dmesg attached.
