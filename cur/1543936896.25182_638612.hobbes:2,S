Right.

I assume, that the floppy and cdrom are already mounted with
nosuid,nodev.
The problem case is I think is if a sysadmin does some mounting in the
initial namespace, and this is propagated into the fully user-mounted
namespace (or chroot), so that a mount with suid binaries slips in.
Which is bad, because the user may be able rearange the namespace, to
trick the suid program to something it should not do.
OTOH, a mount with devices can't be abused this way, since it is not
possible to gain privileges to files/devices just by rearanging the
mounts.
