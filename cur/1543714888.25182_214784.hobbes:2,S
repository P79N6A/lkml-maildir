Hi,
I have 2 questions about disk partitioning under linux 2.6.x :
1/ Is it possible to alter a disk partition of a used disk and beeing 
able to use the modified partition without having to reboot the box?
2/ Is it possible to delete a disk partition without having the 
partition numbers changed?
My box is an AMD 2500+/Asus board with FC1 / 2.6.5.
Do I need to upgrade fdisk or use an other utility? Or do I need to 
apply a kernel patch?
Regards,
Remi
