Andi made this point and I agree. I'm just making the point that people should 
see it as exactly that -- a legacy compatibility layer. It should not be seen 
as a "way out" for vendors looking to write generic DSP software.
The problem with using OSS compatibility, at least on this machine with ALSA 
1.0.9, is that if you use it you automatically lose the software mixing 
capabilities of ALSA, so it really is less than ideal.
