This is a LX164 system, 533 MHz.
I have a hunch it's related to the X server because I've seen it many,
many times while sitting at the console (in X), but never when I'm
logged on remotely.  I've seen it with both XFree86 3.3.6, 4.0.2, 4.0.3,
Matrox Millenium II video card, 8MB.
I'm also experiencing regular X crashes, but the process-table-hang
doesn't occur at the same time as an X crash (or v/v).  I sent a patch
to xfree86@xfree86.org a few days ago that seemed to fix (one of) the X
crashes (in the mga driver, ask if you want details).
(But since the X server shouldn't have the ability to corrupt the
kernel's process list, there has to be a problem in the kernel
somewhere)
Note that this system was completely stable with 2.2 kernels.
Cheers,
