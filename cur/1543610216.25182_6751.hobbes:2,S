BS. You buy an Appliance (let's say an "Limegreen RcK Server") which comes
with a Whizbang Software package (let's say Miracle SQL database (light)).
Miracle has an exclusive licensing agreement with Limegreen that their
software is only used on the RcK Servers and cannot be put onto
"run-off-the-mill" i386 Servers.
As I said "not impossible but much harder".
