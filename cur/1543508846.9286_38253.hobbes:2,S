I've been having some lockups on numerous version of the 2.2 series
(10,11,12) in both SMP and non-SMP mode.
Usually the machine is just locked up hard (alt-sys-req does not work).
This last time though, some scsi timeouts, ide "lost interrupt" messages,
and ethernet timeouts were showing up on the screen.  I still could not do
anything with alt-sys-req.
When an IDE timeout occurred the IDE drive showed some activity followed by
the "hda lost interrupt" message.
It looks like the system was losing ALL interrupts which would also explain
why the keyboard wasn't working.
Does anybody have any idea what could be causing this?  Is this a bad
motherboard?  CPU?
