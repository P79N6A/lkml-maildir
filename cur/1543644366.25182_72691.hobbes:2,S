huh? what is 'the Linux global lock'?

you dont have to hold the lock for the duration of saving the event, the
lock could as well protect a 'current entry' index. (Not that those 2-3
cycles saving off the event into a single cacheline counts that much ...)
the tail-atomic method is precisely equivalent to a global spinlock. The
tail of a global event buffer acts precisely as a global spinlock: if one
CPU writes to it in a stream then it performs okay, if two CPUs trace in
parallel then it causes cachelines to bounce like crazy.

again, what 'expensive Linux global lock' are you talking about?
