This causes the following compile error:

...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x30a210): In function `timer_event':
: multiple definition of `timer_event'
kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x16270): first defined here
ld: Warning: size of symbol `timer_event' changed from 157 in 
kernel/built-in.o to 11 in drivers/built-in.o
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
I'd say drivers/net/skfp/queue.c is more at fault for using the pretty 
generic timer_event name...
