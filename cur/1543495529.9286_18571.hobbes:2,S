Hello, we are working with Linux kernel 2.2.8 and found tiny
but very strange error - `read()' and `write()' can't detect EFAULT
error when file descriptor is associated with a tty and passed data
is NULL, i.e. `write (1, 0, 1)' and `read (0, 0, 1)' works fine and 
returns 1. But if 0 and 1 are redirected to the regular file
via shell > or < commands, -1 is returned, EFAULT is detected and 
errno has appropriate value.
			Sorry for bad english.
