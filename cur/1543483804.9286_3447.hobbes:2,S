Does anyone know if there is a way to get more then 15 paritions per SCSI
device?  I have a 36 GB raid that looks like one drive /dev/sda.  I have
made more then 15 partitions /dev/sda1-/dev/sda21 and I have made the
device files for the ones over 15, but I am not able to mount ones over
15.  I get the following message:
mount: /dev/sda16 already mounted or /u9 busy
mount: /dev/sda17 already mounted or /ua busy
etc...
It there a hard limit of 15 partitions or is there some way around this?
Thanks,
Luke
