Why do you want to do that at interrupt time?
I'd call map_user_kiobuf() when the user-land buffer is set up, and then
write directly (i.e. with kmap_atomic()) into the pages stored in
iobuf->maplist[]. It avoids the page table scan at interrupt time.
Which platform do you use? map_user_kiobuf() doesn't enforce cache
coherency internally, outside of i386 you might need additional
flush_cache_whatever (see Documentation/cachetlb.txt)
