Eyeball checked only, 2 comments:
1) Will the embedded crew object to the removal of CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS?
I can see some systems that don't want either SysV or BSD pty's, unless
they're deeply ingrained in some way I don't understand so you can't have
a system with exactly one tty on a DB-9 serial port for a console without 
having them present too.
2) How much extra code to axe the BSD-style PTYs?
