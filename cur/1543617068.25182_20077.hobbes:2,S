Nope. User error....
A mounted floppy has a file system on it. The first block is boot block,
super block... inode list.... ( or whatever M$ uses ).
A dd to the DEVICE starts writing at block 0. replaces the bootblock, for
as many blocks as are in the file.
This, naturally, destroys the filesystem.
