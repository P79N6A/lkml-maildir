For what it's worth, I have yet to find a tulip driver that works with
all of my 4-port NICs.  Becker's fails with the Phobos 4-port NIC,
a very recent kernel driver fails to negotiate correctly (sometimes)
with the DFE-570tx NIC.  Both of them failed a while back when I tried
to put 3 DFE-570tx's into a single machine.
On average, I've had better luck with the kernel driver than with
Becker's, and since it is quite a pain to compile and test it, I
have been ignoring it more and more.
Mr Becker:  Perhaps you could rename your tulip driver becker_tulip and have
it separately buildable and configurable in the kernel config options?  If
it was back into the kernel proper it would be much easier to experiment with.
Thanks,
Ben
