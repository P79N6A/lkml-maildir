Here's an idea for the main navigation menu structure:
* Menu
** Software
** Documentation
** Tips & Tricks
** Tests & Benchmarks
** Projects
* More Information
** Mailinglists
** IRC
** Links
* Wiki
** mainpage|mainpage
** recentchanges-url|recentchanges
** randompage-url|randompage
** helppage|help
** 
http://www.kernel.org/faq/#donations
|sitesupport
That should cover all the pages currently linked from the main page.
