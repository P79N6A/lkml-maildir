Hi!
I was wondering if Linux supports the equivalent of Sun's tmpfs
filesystem.  I haven't seen it in the 2.2 kernels, and think that it's a
significant detriment.  Is it an option that I'm simply overlooking or
is a group working on an implementation?  For those unaware, it is
simply a pseudo-filesystem that does not reside on disk, but rather
shares disk/memory with the swap.  It's very useful for filesystems such
as /tmp where data needn't or shouldn't persist across reboots, and
helps answer the question "should /tmp be its own partition?"
The second thing could be a substancial change in the kernel.  When I
write my code, I use the following debugging construction:
----------
#if DEBUG > 9
# error Unknown debug level
#endif
#if DEBUG > 8
# define DEBUG9(x) {}   /* Same as a comment */
#endif
#if DEBUG > 7
# define DEBUG8(x) printf x
#else
# define DEBUG8(x) {}
#endif
...
#ifdef DEBUG
# define DEBUG0(x) printf x
#else
# define DEBUG0(x) {}
#endif
----------
Then, in the source code, I can use the following syntax:
----------
...
DEBUG6(( "Testing the foo for barness... " ));
if( foo == bar )
{	DEBUG6(( "it bars.\n" ));
	do_something( foo );
} else
	DEBUG6(( "nope.\n" ));
...
----------
And when I compile the program, I pass the compiler the DEBUG flag.  If
DEBUG is set to 6 in this case, the DEBUG6() construct becomes printf
(can be changed to printk, or whatever) or if it is below 6, it gets
compiled as:
----------
...
{}
if( foo == bar )
{	{}
	do_something( foo );
} else
	{}
...
----------
I find it useful for debugging and for compiling out a lot of cruft if
it isn't really needed.  It's not very helpful for variable output
setting at runtime, but it can eliminate a lot of "if( debuglevel == foo
) printk(...)" statements if you are willing to never have the ability
to turn them back on without recompiling.  It may not be that much of a
savings, but it will eliminate some branching and resident memory size,
though it is a lot of work.
Figured I'd throw it out anyway if anyone was interested.
Christopher
