This is an important point.  'cat /lib/libc.so.6' does horrible things on
and to my terminal.  Is cat broken?  No, I'm broken if I think that this
command means anything useful.  'cat /libc/libc.so.6 > libc.so.6' works
just fine.

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
