Actually, the #6944 requires more investigation. I've noticed the 
kacpid going to 100% cpu without the unhide patch applied as well. It 
happens sometimes after dehibernation, putting the laptop to sleep
and waking it up again resolves the issue. I can't figure out why.
To be on the safe side I'd suggest dumping the patch, but I really 
don't think it should fix anything.
