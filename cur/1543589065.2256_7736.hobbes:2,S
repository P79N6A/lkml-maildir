      Hi People...
   got a following "dead of alive" question:
   how to find a root block on a ReiserFS partition
   with a corrupted superblock?
   reiserfsprogs-3.x.0.9j simply writes -2^32
   there at start (reset_super_block) and then simply
   crashes when attempting to access to such mad place
          ... got nearly lost my main partition ...
 sorry for bad english
