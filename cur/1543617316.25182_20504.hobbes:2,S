Interestingly I have about the same setup and use, only I transfer about 25 GB
a day via nfs to an Asus CUV4XD with 2 GB under 2.4.18-pre3 and do not
experience any problem so far. I haven't had any with 2.4.17, too. Cache is
pretty heavy used, but I experience no slowdown or other weird things. Can this
be somehow chipset related? Maybe something about the DGE cards? I am using TP
100MBit tulip-based.

Stephan
