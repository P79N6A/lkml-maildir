Actually reading said patch and thinking helps. I'll go hide back under
my rock now...
What:  vm_ops.nopage
When:  Soon, provided in-kernel callers have been converted
Why:   This interface is replaced by vm_ops.fault, but it has been
       around forever, is used by a lot of drivers, and doesn't cost
       much to maintain.
Jon.
