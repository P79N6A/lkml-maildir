I suppose that might help.  But for me the bug triggered towards the end of
initscripts (it moves around) after we've been through that code path a
zillion times.  It probably needs to be solved by inspection.  If one can
get it to happen reliably.
I found that sysfs-class-10-vc.patch caused it to happen and
use-kthread-primitives.patch made it go away again.  Neither patch has
anything to do with tty refcounting and locking.
