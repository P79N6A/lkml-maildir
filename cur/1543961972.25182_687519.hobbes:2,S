in more detail: any "negative reinforcement" should be on the 
_technical_ level, i.e. when changes are handled - not at the broad tree 
level.
Sure, there are exceptions, etc. - but by the time stuff goes upstream 
it's too late and we've got to fix stuff instead of trying to push back 
on each other.
by earlier integration (= linux-next) we can do the pushback much 
earlier, in a much more granular, much more technical in a much less 
personal way: "hey Ingo, your new sched-dizzy-blah patch broke stuff 
here, zap it" or "hey Dave, that socket-foo rewrite just broke things 
here, zap it".
git-revert _kind of_ makes that possible too, but people still feel too 
personal about reverts - they take it as intrusion into their subsystem 
and regard it as an attack against their competence as a maintainer.
and this is all so typical btw.: the most effective measure against 
human warfare is for people to see each other and to talk to each other.
[ That's one reason why i am so worried about mailing list isolation.
  People get more distant, they mean less to each other, work less with
  each other => Linux suffers. I do accept that for some people lkml is
  simply too noisy - but i think the cure is worse than the disease. ]
