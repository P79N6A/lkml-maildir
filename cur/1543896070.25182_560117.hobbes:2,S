A patent prevents you from using the software in any way at all, while a
hardware restriction prevents you from using the software on that
particular hardware, but not on lots of other hardware.  Very big
difference.

I wouldn't call it a duty.  It is the chosen mission perhaps, but nobody
is making them do it.

So what would happen if some company was to make software for a tivo and
released their binaries signed with some specific key, and they released
information on how to check this was signed with their key, and then
some other companies went and made tivo hardware and decided that they
would only allow code signed by the first companies key to run on it,
because that company had software which was acceptable to the
DMCA/RIAA/MPAA/etc and allowed them to get access to the hardware they
wanted to use in their box.  The second company now sells hardware to
make money, and the first company sells tv guide updates service to
people who want to use their software releases fully.
What does the GPL do now?  The software company still releases the
sources to the GPL software, but their binary releases are signed with a
key they don't give you.  They didn't provide you with any hardware, you
have to buy that from the hardware company that makes a product that
happens to run that software because it has the right bits of hardware
to record tv programs and such.  The hardware company put restrictions
on what software the box will run, although techicly the software
company that has the signing key could make lots of compatible software
for that particular locked down hardware, including vxworks or windows
based code if they chose to do so, while the hardware company just makes
hardware and decided to only allow software with the signature to run.
They didn't distribute any software, the buyer has to go get that from
the software company if they want the box to be useful (probably not a
good business plan for the majority of customers, but still possible in
theory).

Well many people in the community disagrees, and you can't change their
mind on that it would seem, just as they can't change yours (or the FSFs
for that matter).  I would not be surprised to see some code forks when
the GPLv3 is finally released.
