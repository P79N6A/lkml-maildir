Ah, but out-of-tree code is what I'm stuck w/maintaining.  I wouldn't
want to infest in-tree drivers w/#ifdef's either, but they are a fact
of life in my world.  And, lately, _really_ ugly version tests.
If I had _my_ way, there would be a kernel_interface_change.h file that
had an #define'd entry for _every_ kernel interface change within a
major release series:
/*
  * include/linux/interrupt.h interface change x.y.z
  * interrupt handler now takes 2 args
  */
#define INTERRUPT_H_CHANGE_X.Y.Z "interrupt handler now takes 2 args"
or something.
I understand that many (most?) kernel maintainers would prefer that
all drivers be brought in-tree, and aren't particularly concerned
when interface changes affect out-of-tree drivers.
Respectfully, I suggest that world domination isn't quite the same
thing as world dictatorship, and maybe the road to the former would
be helped by a little less of the latter :)
Rat-bastard out-of-tree maintainer takes refuge under desk....
Thanks,
Bill
