Well, I think the bitterness comes from (partily anyways) it going into
2.4.0-test9-pre1, along with other seemingly large updates, which did need
to go in but really don't sound right for a -test.  I guess Linus didn't want
to see 2.3.1xx like we did with 2.1.  But the 2.2.0-testX patches seemed like
small stuff (maybe my memory just sucks tho).

What Cort didn't mention is that at least some of this fun experimental stuff
is things like better support for new machines, along with bug fixing for 2.4
(ie people can use all their PCI cards without resource conflicts again).
