No, the basic problem there is that the kernel is deadlocking.  Read the
VERY long thread for the details.
I think I have enough on the ball to be able to tell the difference between
mutt opening a folder and counting messages, with a counter and percentage
indicator advancing, and mutt sitting there deadlocked with the HD activity
light stuck on and all the rest of X stuck tight.
And it just happened again, so -rc6 is no sure fix.  What did y'all that
reported the problem had gone away do, patch -rc4 with the akpm patches?
