Perhaps you don't have writing access to the directory where the program is placed, or there is already a core file in the same directory, which you don't have writing access to. Another possibility (more likely) is that 'ulimit -c' is set too low. Try typing 'ulimit -c unlimited' and see if that works. This command will produce a core file for every segfault that occurs, which may be inconvenient, so take a note of what ulimit is set to before you change it.
Hope that helps. Good luck.
