Some time ago I offered the opinion that this was the correct way to go. 
  Linux presents real SCSI, PPA, USB, and firewire as SCSI, and with 
ide-scsi all ATAPI devices are covered as well.
I have not tried ide-floppy in some time, but my two machines which do 
ZIP drive media exchange both use the ide-scsi interface and 2.4 kernel 
to talk to the devices. They are unlikely to get or need an update, but 
I did try ide-floppy at one time and had some poorly-remembered 
"learning experience" doing so.
Thanks for your work on this!
