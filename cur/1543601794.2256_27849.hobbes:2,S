Aha! I'm not alone and I'm not nuts. And it doesn't seem to be an Athlon/VIA
thing either.
This is exactly the same thing I'm seeing. And if I put calls to 'ps aux' in
/etc/init.d/halt around the killall5 and sleep calls then it shuts down
properly.
Here's my setup for reference:
1xAthlon 1050/100, Asus A7V, 512 MB PC133 RAM
2xATA/66, hda:CD-ROM, hdc:CDRW
2xATA/100 (Promise 20265 on-board), hde:HD (ext3/vfat), hdg:HD (vfat)
Stock RH7.1+Updates+2.4.9-ac12-preempt1
