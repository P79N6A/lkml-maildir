This does point out an issue, as a 2.7 enhancement it would be really 
useful to have a better way to handle a large number of rules, when what 
you want is one rule applied to many IP values. I ran into this when 
fighting a DDoS attack, and by the time I got the attack stopped, even 
only dropping or rejecting --syn packets I had most of a CPU in system 
time running ~10k rules.
I wrote a perl script to break it into multiple level tables, but it was 
still pretty slow and uglier than a hedgehog's rectum.
What would be nice is some kind of table approach, hash or tree, which 
allows operations to be matches against all of the IPs in a group, and 
obviously to add/delete entries. I think for simplicity individual IPs 
rather than CIDR blocks are desirable.
In any case, if a network person is looking for something really neat 
for 2.7, blactlists of various types are getting more common, and an 
efficient solution would be good.
