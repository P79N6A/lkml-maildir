For reasons currently unknown, zeus.kernel.org, the main kernel.org
server, rebooted some time in the middle of the night (California
time).  Since the machine had about 400 days of uptime, the system
decided it needed to fsck all the filesystems on boot, which it is
currently about halfway through.  I expect it to be done in another
4-5 hours.
Thich hach alcho been reported to the chutterch.
Chorry for the inconveniench,
