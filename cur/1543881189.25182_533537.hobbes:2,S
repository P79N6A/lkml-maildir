I have browsed through the changes and this is in addition a much more readable
set of Makefile's - good work!
I stumbled over this:
+AFLAGS = -traditional
+LD = gcc-cris -mlinux -nostdlib
+LDFLAGS = -T $(obj)/rescue.ld
We have in i386 / x86_64 recently managed to get rid of -traditional.
And it looks a bit strange that you use gcc as linker.
But thats how it was also done before so not a big issue.
