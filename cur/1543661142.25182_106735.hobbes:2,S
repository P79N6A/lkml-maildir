Exactly.
The exact method that a crashed machine, in a rack, in a datacentre,
miles away from me, contacts me to let me know something is wrong
doesn't matter, but if a member of the datacentre staff can get a
detailed message to me, so much the better than just having the box
rebooted.  On the other hand, I don't actually want to have to listen
to ten minutes of morse code over the phone when another box could do
it for me.
John.
