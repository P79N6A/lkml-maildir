You'd need to run a 2.4 kernel.
Current problems with 2.6:
1 ext3 causes kjournald oops on load
2 xfs has bad NFS/SMP/dcache interactions (you end up with undeletable
  directories)
3 knfsd will give you stale handles (can be worked around by stat'ing
  all your directories constantly on the server side)
The SGI XFS kernel from CVS actually almost solved (2) above, but not
entirely - I was going to report on that again to LKML. The other
problems are still, as far as I know, unsolved.
Not trying to flame anyone here, just trying to be realistic  ;)
