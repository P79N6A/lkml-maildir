Dave Jones reported seeing bad pmd messages in 2.6.11.6. I've been
seeing them with 2.6.11 and today with 2.6.11.6. When I first saw the
problem I ran memtest86 and it didn't catch anything after ~3hours.
However, I don't see them when X starts. They tend to happen after a
program segfaults:
2.6.11:
Apr  3 23:23:33 klaatu kernel: sh[16361]: segfault at 0000000000000000
rip 0000000000000000 rsp 00007ffffffff020 error 14

.. many more ...
2.6.11.6:

At the time I was doing a
find ... -exec grep -H ...
over a linux kernel tree.
I repeated the find and I didn't see segfaults the second run.
