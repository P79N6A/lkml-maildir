Either way, all ambiguity is removed if you put the unit in the name. And
don't use jiffies because that obviously is not portable (which sounds like
it was Linus' biggest concern).
Once you do that, I don't much care whether you use seconds or milliseconds.
Other than to note that many of our units now are ms, especially when 
they're
measuring things at or around the ms order of magnitude. But I'm not 
aware of
so many proc values that don't work in integers.
