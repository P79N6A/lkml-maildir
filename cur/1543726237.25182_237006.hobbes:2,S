I would like to see this patch go into 2.6.8. We already changed
the major number in linuxtv.org CVS and announced it on our
website, so this might help keep the time of confusion for
DVB users short.
The patch below should go along with it. It fixes some breakage
in dvb_usercopy() introduced by Al Viro's sparse cleanups in -rc2.
(A similar patch might have been mailed already by Michael Hunold.)
