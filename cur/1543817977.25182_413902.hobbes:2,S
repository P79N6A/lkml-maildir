> 1) Why, we already have zero-copy?
It's poorly named.  The sendpage side is so that Lustre's in-kernel
'tcpnal' can get callbacks when an skb tx is completed.  I don't know
what the recvpackets thing is for.
It certainly doesn't look like something that will be merged.
(duplicate code, nutty style, questionable double callback registration,
etc)
