Another data-point: Upon replacing the SiImage card
with my older HPT366 pci card, the problem does not
occur at all. Any ideas? Alan, Andre?

With Kernel-1, I can successfully boot and run my system whether
or not I use vga=788. From dmesg:

With Kernel-2, if I use vga=normal, then everything seems normal -
I can boot and run my system. From dmesg:
SiI680: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:0a.0

Now, with Kernel-2, if I use vga=788, boot fails:
------ Hand copied from screen.

Freeing unused kernel memory: 140k freed
Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel.
In these three cases, there are interesting address differences
which mean nothing to me...
What can I do to overcome this problem? Full dmesg logs, config,
and lspci output are gzipped and attached. I can provide any more
information which maybe necessary.
Kindest regards,
