OK, thanks.  I would expect all compilers to be happy with that.  However a
bit of googling I did indicated that lint (or some flavour thereof)
complains about the missing cast.  Which is dumb of it.

Actually..  kmem_cache_destroy() returns void, so any checker which complains
about the missing cast needs a stern talking to.
