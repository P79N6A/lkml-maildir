I have problems to understand the file cache algorithms.
The following behaviour is observed with kernel 2.2.15pre5 + ide20000127
patch.
My Computer has 256 MB RAM and initially a big part of them is free.
If i generate a big file, most of the free memory is used for the page
cache, as expected:
% dd if=/dev/zero of=xtmp bs=1000000 count=300
% free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:        258248     255208       3040       6608     188100     
11016
-/+ buffers/cache:      56092     202156
If i remove this file, the file file cache is further used:
% rm xtmp
% free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:        258248     255156       3092       6968     188008     
11040
-/+ buffers/cache:      56108     202140
But what is in the file cache? There is no corresponding file system
data for the file cache, because 'xtmp' vanished.
My other problem:
Now if i *read* the same file instead of removing the file like above,
the file
cache is not longer used after the unlink command:
% dd if=/dev/zero of=xtmp bs=1000000 count=300
% free
Mem:        258248     255252       2996       5892     195252      
4956
-/+ buffers/cache:      55044     203204
% wc xtmp
% free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:        258248     255540       2708       4852       5244

% rm xtmp
% free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:        258248      44304     213944       4864       5272

It seems to me that the file cache ...
- is used longer than the live time of a file, if the corresponding file
is *written* but
-  vanishes if the file is *read* and then deleted.
I won't say that this is an error in the cache code, i don't know it!
But i simply don't understand whats happen. Could someone explain?
The described behaviour seems to me a little inconsistent, out of the
view
of a simple user.
