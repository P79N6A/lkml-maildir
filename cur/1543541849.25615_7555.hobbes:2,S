Fine. Then it's a file with named streams. 
If both
	myfile
and
	myfile/resource
become valid strings to pass to the "open" syscall then I get upset.
Fine now I'm using your terminology. Does that help you understand
what I'm trying to say? I think you're just playing dumb. That doesn't
help a discussion.
The reason I get upset is that old utilities like "tar" will no longer
work. Too many things won't work. So, my suggestion is to stay away
from that design.
