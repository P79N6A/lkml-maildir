Actually, I'm pretty happy sometimes with the current behavior: if the
interface goes down and back up with the same AP within a short enough time,
it typically gets the same IP and the router's NAT table still has the TCP
connection live and things "just work".
So I'd want to kill the connections not when the interface goes down, but in
comes back up with a different IP.
