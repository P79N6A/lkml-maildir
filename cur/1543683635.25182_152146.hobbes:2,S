Yes, and I'm trying to tell you that it's not the only way to solve it,
but it is the simpliest way to do it. As I'm sure most of linux users
that have steped into this "behaviour" think about it.
>Ummm, with "hidden" you still have to make a configuration change.
Just enabling it in the /proc switch.
It could be done "by default" but as we talked about it in the netdev
list, changing the default behaviour of linux when it has been working
this way for years is not a good thing.

Non-RFC compliant? What RFC is breaking?
I don't think the hidden breaks any RFC, aso I don't think the actual
behaviour breaks any RFC, but if it would do, it would be the actual
one.
The actual behaviour of linux makes loopback interfaces no sense.
Also, as long as I know, 127.0.0.1 is not answered in ARP, although
it's the default address of lo interface. So... there's some filter in
the kernel too.

I think you are wrong, RFCs do not say anything about interfaces. It's
decission of the OS how this is to be implemented.

Not at all, it ignore ARP requests coming from an interface and with
destination the IP address of OTHER interface.
If there's something wrong, I think this is the wrong behaviour.
If we go back to my "problem" setting, linux is doing an ARP request
putting in the src IP addreess, the address of the loopback interface,
that has no sense on the ethernet inteface, causing Cisco to not reply
to this packet (although I think Cisco is failing RFC).

I think the hidden patch is also RFC compliant.
More, the "hidden" patch makes Linux behave like other OS and systems I
have tested.
So... you say all these systems are NOT RFC compliant?

Being the hidden patch the simpliest approach to solve of these
"problems".

As long as I know, the hidden patch does isolation of interfaces at
layer 2 (ARP).
About isolation of interfaces at layer 3, the forwarding switch in
/proc should be used.
About the kenel is not the right place to do these things, there are
switchs:
proxy_arp
rp_filter
accept_redirects
forwarding
send_redirects
These example switchs modify the behaviour of the linux box in the
kernel, without using netfilter.

I'm not sure, but IPVS is the Linux Virtual Server?
Well... my "problem" setting was not with LVS, I use a Cisco hardware
load balancing device.
Also, the problem in this setting is not in the load balancing device,
it's on the "real servers" that does not use the LVS software at all.
Just these servers don't know they are being "balanced".
But again, David, LVS is not the only setting that reveal this
"problem" with interface isolation. Bas has stepped into the same
"problem" in another setting.
Also, this "problem" with linux open a minor security hole (see Bas
mail), unless you use ARP filter or hidden patch.
