Cool, but a very specific environment, no? ;)
What concerns me about all this is that it seems
so very host-centric design. Wouldn't it be nice if
we had a little bit more network-centric worldview
when designing network infrastructure?
It isn't just a matter of how had we can push stuff
out, it also matters how much the network can take.
Blasting tens of gigs into the ether seems all very
exciting sexy and cool, but suited for dedicated links
or network attached storage channels, not general-purpose
networking on the Internet or intra-nets.
And if that is the case, we're talking about a much
smaller market (but perhaps a more profitable
one ;))...
thanks,
Nivedita
