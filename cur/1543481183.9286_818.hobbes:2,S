I did a search for "scsi-idle linux" on infoseek and www.linux.org, and

I downloaded your patch and it has more stuff in it than mine. :-)  
+    SCpnt->use_sg  = 0;                /* No scatter/gather for

+    SCpnt->bufflen = 0;                /* No response for START_STOP */
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
