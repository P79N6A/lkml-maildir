i have also had a few problems with nfsd when i have
moved to 2.4.x (2.4.5-ac15 currently) from 2.2.x
both the server and client side.
problems i have been seeing include.
a) if the server goes down the client sometimes does not remount the
   share. and it prints lots of "stale nfs handles or something"
   this is fine if it is remounted by hand.

there are some options that do things with symlinks have you tried
looking at some of those ?

hi yes i saw this it appeard to rpc.mountd that the
client had already mounted the dir but the nfsd
seemed to think otherwise it was returning the
error to rpc.mountd rebooting the server was the only
work around i found in this restarting the programs
did not seem to help.
eg
client1: mount /home (works fine)
client2: mount /home (did not work)
server: restart nfs programs
client2: mount /home (did not work)
server: reboot
client2: mount /home (works)
and client1 works all the way though (except when the
server is down of course)
i have only seem these a few times and its been working fine
since. so i think they are probably pritty hard to produce
