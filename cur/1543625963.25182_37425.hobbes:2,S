I haven't recieved your original message, so I don't know what version
of PostgreSQL you're using, but I believe it is pertinent given that
versions >= 7.2 (and perhaps >= 7.1) *do* pre-allocate WAL logs, which
is where most of the action is.
It might be that in this situation you might benefit from any
reduction in FS overhead even if it means a reduction in features
because WAL is going to dramatically change the way disk access
happens.
