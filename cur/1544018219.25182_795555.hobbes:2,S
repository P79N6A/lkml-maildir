No, it's not to be expected.  You should be able to use everything up
to 100% of what is reported by df.  There is the 5% reserved blocks
which only root is allowed to use, but df takes that into account.  So
if you can't use that last 62944k reported by df after a reboot, and
df -i reports enough inodes, that's definitely a bug in ext4.
Would you be willing to send me a compressed raw e2image file?  You
can generate it as follows:
    e2image -r /dev/hda2 - | bzip2 > /tmp/hda2.e2i.bz2
Ideally this should be done while the filesystem is unmounted, or
mounted read-only. 
It will give me a copy of the filesystem metadata, but no data blocks.
That will allow me to try to replicate the problem on my system.  It
will probably be still too large e-mail, so if you can put it up on
some web or ftp server, and send me the URL, that would be best.
Thanks!!
