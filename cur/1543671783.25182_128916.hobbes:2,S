At some point, I would wonder 'why'? I've always considered the real
benefit of sendfile() that the system never has to fully swap your
process in, in order to do work on your behalf as would be necessary
with read() and write(). The zero copy architecture doesn't seem
significant to me if you are going to wait between sendfile()
requests.

To some degree, couldn't sendto() fit this description? (Assuming the kernel
implemented 'zero-copy' on sendto()) The benefit of sendfile() is that
data isn't coming from a memory location. It is coming from disk, meaning
that your process doesn't have to become active in order for work to be
done. In the case of UDP packets, you almost always want a layer on top
that either times the UDP packet output, or sends output in response to
input, mostly defeating the purpose of sendfile()...
