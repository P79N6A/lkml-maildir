I have also seen some problems with the Tyan S2720 with hyperthreading 
enabled in a dual P4 configuration during bootup.  Several of the 
drivers lock up during bootup, AIC7XXX gets scsi timeouts and 
3Ware cards hard hang the bus when hyperthreading is enabled.  These 
problems do not occur on the SuperMicro P4DE6 which is also running 
the Intel 7500 chipset.
