here are the results:
under 2.6.8 kernel with agsize=2g (440 some AGs): 6.9ms avg access
under 2.6.8 kernel with agcount=32: 6.2ms
under 2.6.17 kernel with partition made in 2.6.8 with agcount=32: 6.2ms
under 2.6.17 kernel just reading from /dev/sdb1: 6.2ms
under 2.6.17 kernel with new partition (made under 2.6.17) with 
agcount=32, file created via the xfs_io reserve call: 6.9 ms
under 2.6.17 kernel just reading from /dev/sdb1: 6.9ms (not sure why 
this changed from 6.2 the day before)...
So it seems like going to 32 AGs helped about 10%, but other then that 
not much else is making much of a difference... now I am moving on and 
trying to break the RAID up and testing individual disks to see their 
performance...
