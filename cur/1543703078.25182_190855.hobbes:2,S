What is the advantage of not putting the autodetector/setup in the kernel? 
Not everyone is going to use this software (or am I wrong on that?) so that
can be left as an option to compile in (or as a module if possible and if
autodetection is not required).  How much work is it to maintain something
like this in the kernel?
I ask because I'm not a kernel hacker, mostly an end user  (atleast I can
compile my own kernels =)
I must say, the day that kernel level ip configuration via bootp is removed
I'm going to be pissed =)
I like the fact that MD can autodetect raids on boot when compiled in, I
didn't like the fact it can't be partitioned.  That's the only thing that
put me off with MD.  LVM put me off because it couldn't be auto detected at
boot.  I was going to play with DM, but I haven't yet.
