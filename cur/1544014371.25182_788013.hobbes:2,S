Ok, I committed it as a quick-fix. I'm not sure that is necessarily the 
final one, but at least it is better than not compiling.
For example, it's kind of silly to use two __fswab32()'s with other 
oddness if that one just falls back on __constant_swab32: maybe we'd want 
to make sure that we'd use ___constant_swab64() in that case, and only do 
the whole __SWAB_64_THRU_32__ if we really have a __arch_swab32() 
function.
Of course, I do hope that anybody who #defines __SWAB_64_THRU_32__ already 
has that __arch_swab32() thing, so it's likely fine.
I also wonder whether gcc generates better code with a union than with 
that 64-bit math...
