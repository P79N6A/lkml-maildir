Doesn't this [renumbering nodes] just move the problem to that "last"
node?  I.e., when one attempts to allocate normal memory from the last
node, it will overflow to the DMA zone.  What we need is for and DMA[32]
zone[s] to be last in [or excluded from?] the Normal/Movable/High/...
zonelist for each node.  That is what Kame's patch does.
