    Vojtech, how do you feel about the psmouse_imps2 patch[1] that's
been in -mm since -test4-mm5?  Several people have told me it's been
useful for them, to either make their Belkin KVM switches work with
Logitech mice or to disable the Synaptics touchpad driver at runtime
and still be able to use scroll mice.

    I could write a patch to selectively enable or disable all the
different mouse drivers if you would prefer something more general.
