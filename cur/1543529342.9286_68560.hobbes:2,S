I can add it during 2.4.x - adding new drivers is not a problem, the same
way we have added new drivers to 2.2.x.
But at this point I'd prefer to not get it for the pre-2.4.x series, just
to make the patches smaller and hopefully bug-fixes only.
The only special case would be if somebody comes out with a driver that is
for something =SO= popular that I think everybody will want it in 2.4.0
and not have to wait. I can't think of any such thing off-hand, but maybe
a softmodem driver would count for psychological reasons or something like
that.
