It is a bug if it behaves differently, without question.
Can you give a trace of a bad case?  The code looks fine to
me, but if I am shown a specific trace I may be able to see
the bug.
Please, this is an issue I have with many bug reports.  The
text of the report uses a lot of non-specific wording, "SIOCGIFCONF
with NULL arg gives different results on sparc64 than i386"  That
is great and gives me the gist of the problem, but without a specific
trace of arguments and results and a description of what is
specifically expected in this traced case compared to what actually
happened, I do a lot of guessing to work on a fix.
Later,
