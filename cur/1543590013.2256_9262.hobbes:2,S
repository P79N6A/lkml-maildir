  Yep.  I think it's just the fact that the KT133A chipset is so new
that
very few people have it.  And of the people who have it, I think a great
majority are running on distributions of Linux whose kernels are
NOT athlon optimized.  
  I'd like to ask everyone who has a KT133A to please try a 2.4.x kernel
with Athlon optimizations and let us know what percentage are displaying
this problem. 
  Thank you!
