And the problem with that is? You haven't noticed this in the five
years it's been there providing XFS with a consistent shrinker
interface.....
FWIW, digging back into history, Rusty's first patch basically
brings use back to the same interface we had in 2.4. Here's
the 2.4 version of that function:
kmem_shaker_t
kmem_shake_register(kmem_shake_func_t sfunc)
{
        kmem_shaker_t shaker = kmalloc(sizeof(*shaker), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!shaker)
                return NULL;
        memset(shaker, 0, sizeof(*shaker));
        shaker->shrink = sfunc;
        register_cache(shaker);
        return shaker;
}
Cheers,
Dave.
