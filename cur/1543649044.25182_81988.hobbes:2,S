Per Linus request I implemented a syscall interface to the old /dev/epoll
to avoid the creation of magic inodes inside /dev. Since the new
implementation shares 95% of the code with the old one, the old interface
is maintained for compatibility with existing users. The new syscall
interface adds three system calls ( Linus doesn't like multiplexing ) :
#define EP_CTL_ADD 1
#define EP_CTL_DEL 2
#define EP_CTL_MOD 3
asmlinkage int sys_epoll_create(int maxfds);
asmlinkage int sys_epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, unsigned int events);
asmlinkage int sys_epoll_wait(int epfd, struct pollfd **events, int timeout);
The function sys_epoll_create() creates a sys_epoll "object" by allocation
space for "maxfds" descriptors. The sys_epoll "object" is basically a
file descriptor, and this enable the new interface to :
1) Mantain compatibility with the existing interface
2) Avoid the creation of a sys_epoll_close() syscall
3) Reuse 95% of the existing code
4) Inherit the file* automatic cleanup code w/out having to code a
	dedicated one
The function sys_epoll_ctl() is the controller interface and what it does
is pretty obvious. The "op" parameter is either EP_CTL_ADD, EP_CTL_DEL or
EP_CTL_MOD and the parameter "fd" is the target of the operation. The last
parameter "events" is used in both EP_CTL_ADD and EP_CTL_MOD and rapresent
the event interest mask. The function sys_epoll_wait() waits for events by
allowing a maximum timeout "timeout" in milliseconds and returns the
number of events ( struct pollfd ) that the caller will find available at
"*events". The port of the old /dev/epoll to 2.5.44 and the new sys_epoll
are available at :
