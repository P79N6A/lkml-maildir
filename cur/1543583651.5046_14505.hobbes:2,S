I have the same problem Adam has: I'm running 3-5 applications on my
computer. I have 64 MB of RAM and I use usually less than 50 MB. I have
swap for the rare cases where I need more RAM than I have. But with
2.4.x-acyz kernels I do often have to wait several seconds after I
switched to another running application before it's swapped in again
because it seems this application was swapped out to cache some MP3 I
surely won't listen to before the next reboot...

I have no idea for auto-balancing but another idea: It's one possibility
to let the user choose when doing "make *config" what he wants:
- A VM optimized for servers that swaps out applications in favor of
  caching.
or
- A VM optimized for workstations that won't swap out applications in
  favor of caching.
I know that's not a perfect solution but it would make the situation much
better.
