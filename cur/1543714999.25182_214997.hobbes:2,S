Nice.
> Do you really need <asm/pgalloc.h> in include/asm-generic/tlb.h?
Yes it does - tlb.h uses check_pgt_cache().  Also, architecture code
makes use of __pmd_free_tlb and __pte_free_tlb, both of which make
use of code from asm/pgalloc.h.
Not including asm/pgalloc.h into asm/tlb.h or asm-generic/tlb.h means
that all the generic files have to know that asm/tlb.h needs asm/pgalloc.h,
and they also then need to know that asm/pgalloc.h needs asm/pgtable.h,
and asm/pgtable.h needs ...
Is there a reason why:
static inline void __pte_free_tlb(struct mmu_gather *tlb, struct page *page)
{
        tlb_remove_page(tlb, page);
}
can't be like x86 and others in their pgalloc.h:
#define __pte_free_tlb(tlb,pte) tlb_remove_page((tlb),(pte))
(for consistency sake if nothing else) ?
Thanks.
