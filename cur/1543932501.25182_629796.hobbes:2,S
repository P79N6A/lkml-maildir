Yes, it will be (not obviously) inlined, currently.
However, IMHO, it is not fail-safe coding.
I think we might better take care of someone who will modify the code
in the future. If they call those functions from other place,
it will not be inlined, and may be placed out of .kprobes.text.
In that case, we can not prevent inserting kprobes in those functions.
Thus, I recommend you to add __kprobes on those functions.
That indicates which functions will be used by kprobes and gives
hints how to write functions which will be called from kprobes.
(And also, it simplifies coding rule.)
Thank you,
