I was not precise enough - it is not just fork, but the LSM catches 
every time a new process is created - so we do have some way of generic 
catching creation of processes, and denying so, if prohibited.

You are right! ... as long as a new process is not created, this may do 
some damage ... but:

Not mny suid programs would really need to be able to access the /etc 
and everything below... E.g. cdrecord (there were a bug a year ago or 
something)... it should definitely not have access to the possiblílities 
you mention!

Good point!
Best, Kristian.
