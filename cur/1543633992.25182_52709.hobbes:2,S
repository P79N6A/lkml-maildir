Ok! I've semplified too much ;-)!

How can I do it ? Shouldn't be a kernel problem ? I could collect
a various patch around that implement a CPU process bind/affinity and
CPU load balance but how can I determine which CPU have the lowest
load in a given time ?

This could be implemented by the process affinity to bind the
process to a CPU. But I continue to not hunderstand why
I must have only one thread per CPU. There is some URL
where can I see some kernel/sched/vm/I-O/other-think graph about
this point ?
