There is a problem in via audio, that seems to be present in trident.c 
too:  trident_ioctl_mixdev doesn't protect the call to 
codec->mixer_ioctl, which in turn can read and write to the AC97 codec.
I'm saying, (1) hardware semaphores are error prone and (2) are we using 
the hardware sem to work around this lack of locking on ->mixer_ioctl?
