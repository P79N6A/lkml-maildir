Subject: [PATCH] atm/ambassador: fix return code bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While auditing a 'may be used uninitialized' warning, I found a minor
bug:  make_rate() has the standard error code convention -- zero for
success, negative errno on error -- but its return type is defined as
unsigned.
Change the return type to reflect reality.
