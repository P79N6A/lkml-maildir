Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Guilt v0.19

Guilt v0.19 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).
Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

The most important change is the use of the patch file's mtime as the
GIT_{AUTHOR,COMMITTER}_DATE. Without this change, repeated invocations of
"guilt pop -a; guilt push -a" would create new commit's with different
commit dates, creating a lot of garbage commits. Other changes are mostly
related to expanding (and slightly fixing) the regression scripts.
Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
