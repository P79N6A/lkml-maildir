Please do not submit patches directly to head kernel maintainers for
subsystems that are very responsibly maintained.
If Chas believes he should put this ATM change into the 2.4.x
kernel, he undoubtedly will.
I don't know about other people, but when I see people send things
directly to one of the head kernel maintainers for something I
directly maintain, it drives me absolutely crazy.  This feeling is
amplified exponentially if this is submitted privately and it's a
patch that has been knowingly rejected by me, although happily that is
not the case here.
(In particular someone recenrly tried to slip the infamous arp hidden
 into 2.4.x by sending it to Marcelo privately, when Marcelo forwarded
 this to me I wanted to pull all the hair out of my head for someone
 even considering to try doing that.)
