Especially with the indirect function call. Modern CPUs often won't load
the destructor pointer quickly enough to avoid the pipeline bubble.

Also, it results in altered memory barrier semantics. Whether or not
this is actually an issue anywhere, any conversion would have to be
careful. If a memory barrier is required _anywhere_, it is likely to
be required on the final put.
With all those arguments against it, you need to demonstrate
improvements before it can be considered.
