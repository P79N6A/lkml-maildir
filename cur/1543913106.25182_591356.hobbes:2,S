Yes, that'll be the best solution.
The fact that both volumes were controlled with a single control on
2.6.22 was a pure luck (or a side-effect).  It wasn't intended
behavior.  Originally, the driver code is written to control the
volumes of HP and speaker streams separately.  This isn't changed
between 2.6.22 and 2.6.23.
The missing feature (the real Main volume) will be implemented on
2.6.24.  (Not for all codecs, but most of them, I hope.)
