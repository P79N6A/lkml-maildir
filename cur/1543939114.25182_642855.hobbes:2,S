Greetings,
FYI: Porting/rewriting a pcmcia driver that was working in 2.6.17 (PIO-based) to work on 2.6.24 (MMIO-based) and haven't been able
to make it work yet. I've used the good driver to extract values to compair against the new driver.
Bugtracked the issue abit more and found 2 strange factors.
1) Working 2.6.17 driver sets Vcc/Vpp = 30 while 2.6.24 sets it to 50 (using same card)
2) Working 2.6.17 driver uses 2->4 mem_maps while 2.6.24 only uses 1 (bad MAX_WIN?)
Other than that the output seems equal.
Any ideas?
Best wishes
Kristoffer
