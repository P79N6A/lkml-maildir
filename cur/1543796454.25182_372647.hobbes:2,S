Well, the old NVidia module should actually work fine. The VM does a 
number of noisy (and scary) debugging messages, but that's just because 
this area changed a lot, and we do want to know who triggers them. But 
there are at least two reports that seem to be happy with the old module 
just working.
And I actually think I'll just change vm_insert_page() to be a regular 
export. It's not like it does anything really strange, and if the choice 
is between people usign the horrible old interfaces because they don't 
want to use the new one due to that GPL-only, and just making it regular, 
I think I'll make that interface regular.
