We are looking for a stable late model 2.2.x kernel for our production
systems.  We have been lucky in that we haven't seen any problems in
the kernels that we have advanced past 2.2.7.  Since we have a HA
mission we are considered with any reports of corruption or memory
leaks that we do hear of.  Hence we have been slow to migrate past
2.2.7.
It would seem that our experience with 2.2.12 plus Alan's patches are
a little different.  I have a production news server which is running
2-3 gigabytes a day of news and it appears to be fine after about 3
days.  Here is what the memory looks like:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        258076     254440       3636      61744      87672     113364
-/+ buffers/cache:      53404     204672
Swap:       261496       2308     259188
The machine is a dual PII-300 Intel FX MB with a DPT RAID controller
running SMP2.2.12+Alan/Dave's memleak patch.
We also have a production box running a Squid server being fed by an
18 gigabyte DAC960 RAID0 set.  The machine is a dual PII-350 with a
late model Intel MB.  We have about 3 days on essentially the same
kernel as the news server (DPT->DAC960)+Memleak and the memory
consumption pattern appears to be normal.
It would thus appear that the leak may be somewhat hardware or usage
pattern dependent.
