Good day,
	I've posted a couple messages over the past few months to linux-kernel 
concerning my Compaq Professional Workstation 5000 w/ 2 PPro's. The problem I 
had under 2.1.x (but not 2.0.x) was that a processor would fail the post when 
I rebooted the machine. I'm happy to report that the "noapic" option in Alan's 
131 patch fixes this problem. I guess this means the mobo should be 
blacklisted. In summary:
If you're trying to get a Compaq SMP machine to run and are having some 
problems, try the "noapic" solution.
Linus: The noapic patch appears to be nessasary for some of us to run 2.1 and 
hence 2.2 . Please include it in the main tree if you have not already done so.
If anyone needs any additional info (like to blacklist the mobo), please don't 
hesitate to contact me.
Happy holidays,
