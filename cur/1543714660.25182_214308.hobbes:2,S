Hi, Sam,
I have patched to 2.6.6-rc1 (patch-2.6.6-rc1 over kernel 2.6.5 - am I right or 
am I missing some patches in between?), and now symbol exports between 
modules fails. An example with two module-objects - one exports some symbols 
used by the other - shows compile output:
scripts/Makefile.build:36: kbuild: /home/axel/freeSP-1.0.4/drivers/linux/
adc64/busmaster/Makefile - Usage of export-objs is obsolete in 2.6. Please 
fix!

*** Warning: "adc64_count" [/home/axel/freeSP-1.0.4/drivers/linux/adc64/
driver/adc64.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "release_adc64_busmaster" [/home/axel/freeSP-1.0.4/drivers/linux/

*** Warning: "get_adc64_busmaster" [/home/axel/freeSP-1.0.4/drivers/linux/
adc64/driver/adc64.ko] undefined!

The first (exporting) module loads cleanly (lsmod shows the loaded module), 
but insmod'ing the second fails with:
insmod: error inserting './adc64.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module
What's the trick in 2.6.6?
Regards,
Axel
