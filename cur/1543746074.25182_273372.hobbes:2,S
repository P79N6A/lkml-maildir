Hi,
I would like to know if I can use kmap_atomic with KM_USER[01] type
within a non-interrupt context. Looking at comments near kmap_atomic
declarations on sparc or ppc, it seems that this is discouraged.
But lots of code (like filesystem stuff) are currently using it
outside of interrupt context.
Are there special requirements about KM_USER[01] usage in interrupt
or non-interrupt contexts ?
Is it documented somewhere how we can use it ?
What I want to do is just kmap_atomic, copy and kunmap_atomic.
Regards,
