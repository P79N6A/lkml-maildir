It doesn't solve the problem, I have the same issue... And seeing kerneltrap
forums, we're not the only ones.
I fixed that problem by changing .config (it seems that oldconfig messed it) to
show:
CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE=y
Now I don't get the
VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
but when booting, it shows:
VFS: Mounted root (ext3 filesystem) readonly.
and then just freezes.
Any thoughts on this?
(if needed, my config is in 
http://student.dei.uc.pt/~marado/.config
 )
