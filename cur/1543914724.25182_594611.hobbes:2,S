I think I'll rewrite it as "for newer SCSI transports such as FireWire
storage."  ;-)
If SRP was in, can 'such as' be omitted?  "for newer SCSI transports
(Fibre Channel, FireWire storage, iSCSI, SAS, SRP),"  Or would be "for
newer SCSI transports such as Fibre Channel, FireWire storage, iSCSI,
SAS, and more," be OK?
