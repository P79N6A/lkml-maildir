Wait a minute: if you age a page in active by clearing ref-bit and    
moving it to beginning of the list, and your next aging cycle starts  
from the end, that reads like you have to walk the whole list to find 
all the ageable pages for moving "downwards". In fact I expected your 
aging to start the list from the beginning, as there should be "most" 
of the non-ref entries, and you could stop age-walking hitting the    
first ref-page in that list.                                          
This was my guess when aging is used to find possible free pages      
_fast_.                                                               
Am I wrong or is this idea generally not useable?
