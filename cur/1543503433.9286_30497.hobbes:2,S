Thanks a lot for your help, although I am not very pleased
to hear that something with my memory or the CPU is wrong.
But a while ago I had big problems with tar.gz files from
several servers, they were all corrupted. So probably
your diagnosis is right.
But it is great that it is not another kernel bug.
