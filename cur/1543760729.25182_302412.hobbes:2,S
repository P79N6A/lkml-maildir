In compiling 2.4.29 I get this during the compilation of pci-pc.c:
Warning: indirect lcall without `*'
I note from looking around the net that this is an old "problem", dating back 
at least to 2.4.18, if not earlier.
What does it mean? Should I care? If I shouldn't, shouldn't there be a message 
somewhere in the build process that says "This isn't a problem" so people 
don't write to lkml and ask about it?
Thanks in advance for your time and consideration.
