This is not unfortunate at all, this is how the Linux world works. If
there is a reason to change an interface, the interface has to be
changed.

Yes, UDI also guarantees you a trendous overhead and almost certainly
lousy performance - last time I looked at the spec, about a year ago,
it certainly wasn't pretty.
