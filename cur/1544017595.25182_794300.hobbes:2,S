I proceeded the same way : if EAGAIN and data still in the pipe, then
stop polling.

In fact this is fixed now. tcp_splice_read() returns all available data,
which somewhat hides problem #1. I'm running with 23 kB in a push/pull
method all the time, so it remains optimal.

Yes I saw your fix, it was indeed very annoying because the only workaround
I found was to perform an recv(MSG_PEEK) on the socket after each EAGAIN
to check whether the connection was closed or not.
For these reasons, I'd really love to see the few recent fixes backported
to -stable ASAP. It will boost splice() adoption among products.
