Right, I almost never single-step either.  Probably, my favorite technique
is to replace BUG() with asm("int3").

Yup.  I still use a lot of printks, but they are mostly for tracing, not
triangulation.

Yep, I noticed you doing that, very useful, I picked up that technique
from you.  Then I made a little all-purpose proc interface for myself
to make it easy to export my stats structures, which is kind of nice too,
because then you can put a patch out with the hooks still in it, making
it easier for others to participate in the analysis.

Yes, this last one applies equally to kdb, but since I'm not relying
on kdb at the moment, best to leave the lid on that can of flamable
material.
