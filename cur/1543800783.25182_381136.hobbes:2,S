Hi Andrew, Linus,
Now that 2.6.15 has been released, can we merge ocfs2?  It's been in -mm
and as far as we know we've addressed all the concerns that were brought
up by reviewers.
To recap, it's a general purpose clustered file system -- it does not
have Oracle hooks or anything sneaky like that.
Joel has done the heavy lifting to bring its git repository up to date
so one should be able to pull from:
  
http://oss.oracle.com/git/ocfs2.git
If there's anything further that is needed from us (Mark, Joel, myself),
please let us know.
