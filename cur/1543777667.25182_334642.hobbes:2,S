Hello,
How can I compile a kernel module ,that is statically compiled at the
kernel compilation time, with debugging information.
To be more clear, say I have selected CONFIG_XFRM=y in .config file
I want to make a change such that net/xfrm/Makefile has an entry 
CFLAGS += -g so that it generates debugging information for all the
modules in that directory
I successfully did it for dynamically compiled modules that are insmod'ed.
How  can I do it for statically linked modules.
The idea is to do the following
objdump -DS xyz.o 
so that I know the source lines and their assembly translations.
This is useful in crashdump analysis where we get the information of 
<function name + offset>
