asm-alpha has volatile.

Then given that architecture specific code is private to that architecture,
the logical conclusion is that if it isn't required by *an* architectures,
then it should be removed as well.
IOW, you can't assume that because one arch does something one way, that
another has the same restrictions.

So if you want to do that, then I'd prefer that you instead go through all
arch headers and figure out where the volatile is needed, and why, and
document it.
For example FRV, at a glance, doesn't need volatile AFAIKS. Probably neither
do a lot of architectures, given that atomic_read/set/add/etc. need not
imply compiler or memory barriers (I think).
