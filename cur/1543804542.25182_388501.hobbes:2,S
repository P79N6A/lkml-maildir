Ah, ok.  It sounds like Ingo might have a better place to put it anyway.  
(I was thinking this was on the switch out path on the CPU where the 
task last ran, didn't look at it in detail.)
Of course, the other option is just to require tasks that do MMIO 
accesses from userspace to be pinned to particular CPU or node. :)
