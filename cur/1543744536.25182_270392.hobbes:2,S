sure, we could add a wrapper for the wrapper,
but the ifdefs are already gone without doing this --
platform_rename_gsi is present with or without ACPI.
I suppose I could shrink the kernel by 4-bytes by compiling out the
function pointer when IO_APIC is not defined.  I'll be happy to optimize
for that case if you think it justifies the code; though if I were
optimizing for that case, this probably isn't where I'd start.

The _gsi in platform_rename_gsi was consistent with the surrounding use
in the ACPI case.  I decided to re-use the same funtion for the MPS case
for simplicity, even though io_apic.c uses _irq.  If you like, I can add
a synonym using an inline for _irq, but I thought we were moving away
from using _irq, not towards it.
GSI = Global System Interrupt
IRQ = overused so much it means nothing at all
While this fact may not win you over as a fan, GSI is actually
consistent with the language in the ACPI spec.  I don't know if that is
where Bjorn came up with the name, but I do think it was a positive
change.  The reason is that "global" actually means something -- and it
still has the same semantics no matter if your machine passes around cpu
interrupt vectors or if it passes around pin numbers.
