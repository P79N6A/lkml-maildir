    Yup.  I'd toss them onto the distribution CD so that the adventurous
    could attempt to relink.  Dunno what SO would do, though -- given
    the total lack of interest in relinking on the various commercial
    Linux projects I've done, I'd suspect that dropping the objects onto
    a ftp site is probably sufficient.

    david parsons \bi/  Well, you can have the statically linked version
                   \/  that will work, or the dynamically linked version
		         that will only work with libc 5.8.49.hike!.hike!
