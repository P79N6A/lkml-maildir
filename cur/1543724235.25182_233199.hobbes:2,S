I was actually looking through your code when this message arrived.   I am sending out 
another unit Monday to the site installed with reiser and Suse Linux, Might I suggest 
perhaps you consider making the change in reiser for the larger field size to 32 bit (I 
am looking at the code at present, and it appears you are using the same inode 
structure as everyone else) and I will default these systems to reiser instead of EXT3 
for this application.  There's another FS (not NWFS) that actually writes the captured
network traffic streaming to the system at over 400 MB/S which folks haven't seen 
yet, it acts more like on on-disk LRU with huge cache units (137 MB each) 
but snort and the network forensic applications use a standard file system for 
reporting.  Reiser is a good choice if this limitation can be removed.
Veil Erfolg and Gluck.  
Danke,
Jeff
