Subject: [PATCH] Bugfix to commit 4f9a58d75bfe82ab2b8ba5b8506dfb190a267834
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Commit 4f9a58d75bfe82ab2b8ba5b8506dfb190a267834 changes the size of
AT_VECTOR_SIZE from hard coded '44' to a calculation based on the value
of AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH and AT_VECTOR_SIZE_BASE.  The change works for
arch/powerpc, but it breaks arch/ppc because the needed
AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH is not present in include/asm-ppc/system.h and a
default value of 0 is used instead.  This results in AT_VECTOR_SIZE
being too small and it causes a kernel crash on loading init.

I think this bug fix needs to go in ASAP.  I cannot boot my Virtex ppc405
platform without it.
Olaf, do I have the correct solution here?
Thanks,
g.
