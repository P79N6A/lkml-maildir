This seems to work.

[...]
This is an exceedingly unlikely error case so the error message is not
that important, but if you don't mind re-spinning this then please make
it "sfc: RSS disabled due to allocation failure\n".
(Device-related log messages should also include the device address, but
I don't want to add a device parameter to the function just for that.
Maybe we should call this function just once at module init time since
the result is not device-specific.)
Ben.
