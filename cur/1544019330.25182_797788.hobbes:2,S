Quick revival of this old thread with good news.
The "APIC error on CPU1" message is now gone!
With current git head I get:
   ACPI: Waking up from system sleep state S3
   ACPI: EC: non-query interrupt received, switching to interrupt mode
Looks like the recent suspend/resume changes are definitely moving us in 
the right direction.
