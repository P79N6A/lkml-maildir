Actually, those language extensions (while documented for a long time) are 
pretty ugly. 
Some of that ugliness turns into literal bugs when C++ is used.
The cast/conditional expression as lvalue are _particularly_ ugly 
extensions, since there is absolutely zero point to them. They are very 
much against what C is all about, and writing something like this:
	a ? b : c = d;
is something that only a high-level language person could have come up 
with. The _real_ way to do this in C is to just do
	*(a ? &b : &c) = d;
which is portable C, does the same thing, and has no strange semantics.
Similarly, what the _hell_ does the gcc extension
	int a;
	(char)a += b;
really mean? The whole extension is just braindamaged, again probably 
because there were non-C people involved at some point. It's very much 
against the C philosophy. I bet 99% of the people on this list have no 
clue what the exact semantics of the above are.
