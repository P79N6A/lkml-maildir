Module the fact fact lspci could be easly extendid to provide the
same information from user space... wait... we are on unix and we have
manual pages:
        -x     Show hexadecimal dump of first 64 bytes of the  PCI
               configuration  space  (the standard header). Useful
               for debugging of drivers and lspci itself.
        -xxx   Show hexadecimal dump of  whole  PCI  configuration
               space.  Available  only  for  root  as  several PCI
               devices crash when you try to read  undefined  por-
               tions  of the config space (this behaviour probably
               doesn't violate the PCI standard, but it's at least
               very stupid).
As you can see lspci -x -xxx ALREADY DOES THIS!
