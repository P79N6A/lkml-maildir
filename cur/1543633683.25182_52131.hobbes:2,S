Why not let the boot process select the highest of two numbers,
the (default-low) NR_CPUS and the number of CPU's detected?
Boot with "too many" cpu's and you still get to use them - you
merely can't hotplug even more.  
Configuring a high NR_CPUS becomes something only hot-pluggers
need to do, or those whose architecture doesn't support
cpu detection in the early boot process.  Those with a fixed
number of detectable CPUs can simply go with a default of 
NR_CPUS=2 no matter what they actually have.
