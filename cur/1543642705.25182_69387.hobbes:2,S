I think there is a virt_to_bus() macro and its inverse. The 'bus' address
is what you need to give to bus-masters that do DMA. This is different
than virt_to_phys(), which happens to be the same on some platforms
but would not be the same on those, like PPC (Motorola), which have
separate address spaces for different things (RAM, I/O, etc).
Isn't this what you want?
Cheers,
