This is simple enough to do when compiling this code into the kernel,
but becomes much trickier when trying to load it as a module.  I'll
spare your queasy stomach descriptions of the possible solutions that
I've thought of.
So, unless you have non-gross, non-fragile ideas, I only see two
acceptible solutions: (1) compile it in staticly, or (2) leave things
where they are.
I know you're not thrilled about nr 2, but the question is whether it
is acceptible to add 15k code on the chance that someone will want to
do raid5.  At present all the distributions ship modular /dev/md, 
since it has no appreciable impact until the personalities are loaded.
