Hi,
Following this message are 12 bugs fixes and minor clean ups from the
GFS2 -fixes git tree. They are all pretty small, most are just a few
lines long.
I've only just pushed the patches, so it may take a little while for
kernel.org's mirrors to pick them up. They are all in the -nmw tree as
well, of course,
Steve.
