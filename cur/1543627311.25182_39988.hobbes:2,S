Right. Seems that the somewhat ancient ksymoops (0.6e) didn't pick up the
smbfs module's symbols. Will update.

Thanks for the tip. Upgrading the 2.0.6 to 2.0.10 ASAP.

<snip good explanation>
Aha! I traced it as far as these lines myself yesterday, but couldn't
figure out what nulled sock_file, and why. Thanks!

Thanks, will try the patch as soon as I find time to rebuild. Looks sane

Could be, I suppose. No automounter running, but the script that oopsed is
run once an hour and does an umount/mount to deal with the windows server
being rebooted - we want the share to stay mounted, no matter if we reboot
the old NT4 box. (If we reboot it and don't do this, we get I/O errors on
accessing the mount point.)
