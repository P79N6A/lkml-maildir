hi,  
i have been having this problem w/ various compressed files since
2.4.0-test1:
int-21h:~$ tar xvfz filname.tar.gz
...files go by...
then:
tar: Skipping to next file header
gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--crc error
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
same basic error w/ bzip2'ed files...
these files all work perfectly w/ 2.2.16...
thanks...
David F.
