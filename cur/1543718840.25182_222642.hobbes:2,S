Looks good ! That gives us a guarantee that set_pte is never ever called
on a present PTE (thus letting set_pte be non-atomic) and we can safely
BUG_ON(pte_present(*ptep)) in it, right ?
Note that having different set_dirty and set_accessed may be useful for
some archs, thouh I agree a single atomic operation is enough on ppc
too, I also want to make sure nobody ever gets the idea of using that
for anything but those 2 bits... Well, that's a matter of taste, go for
what you prefer.
ppc64 version of this would look like
static inline unsigned long ptep_set_bits(pte_t *p, unsigned long set)
{
	unsigned long old, tmp;
	__asm__ __volatile__(
	"1:	ldarx	%0,0,%3\n\
	or	%1,%0,%4 \n\
	stdcx.	%1,0,%3 \n\
	bne-	1b"
	: "=&r" (old), "=&r" (tmp), "=m" (*p)
	: "r" (p), "r" (clr), "m" (*p)
	: "cc" );
	return old;
}
ppc32 would be:
#define ptep_set_bits(p, bits) pte_update(p, 0, bits)
