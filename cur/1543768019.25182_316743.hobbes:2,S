I am explicitly ignoring the core subject on this thread. This
is a side note, regarding coding style.
I always use a common format for an empty body:
	while (deflate(&stream, 0) == Z_OK)
		{}
It stands out and positively says what is meant. As such it
makes it much more readable.
I think that CodingStyle should provide guidance for empty
bodies.
