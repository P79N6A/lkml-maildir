I'm not really following.
Whether or not dnotify is a configuration option is separate, and could
go into the kernel either way.
But what matters if our inotify patch also carries the change?  People
with inotify definitely DO want this patch, because they don't need
dnotify.  Not much uses dnotify--it is a pain to use--and inotify
replaces its functionality.
It is also a practical move: the diffs conflict.
