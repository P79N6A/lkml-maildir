The parameter format from the source code is:
/*
 * LILO/Module params: 
aha1542=<PORTBASE>[,<BUSON>,<BUSOFF>[,<DMASPEED>]]
 *
 * Where:  <PORTBASE> is any of the valid AHA addresses:
 *                      0x130, 0x134, 0x230, 0x234, 0x330, 0x334
 *         <BUSON>  is the time (in microsecs) that AHA spends on the
AT-bus
 *                  when transferring data.  1542A power-on default is
11us,
 *                  valid values are in range: 2..15 (decimal)
 *         <BUSOFF> is the time that AHA spends OFF THE BUS after while
 *                  it is transferring data (not to monopolize the bus).
 *                  Power-on default is 4us, valid range: 1..64
microseconds.
 *         <DMASPEED> Default is jumper selected (1542A: on the J1),
 *                  but experimenter can alter it with this.
 *                  Valid values: 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 (MB/s)
 *                  Factory default is 5 MB/s.

I've a pnp sound card that fails to configure with a similar error
message when a (CHECK) entry was found in an (IO ...) block. Removing
those entries solved the problem. Try this in your pnpconfig.txt:
(IO 0 (SIZE 4) (BASE 0x0330))
