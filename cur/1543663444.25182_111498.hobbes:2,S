Subject: uptime reset on 2.4.11/12 (and maybe newer versions?) at +/- 500 days ?

yesterday, 2 machines went back to uptime 0 without a reboot
(think they booted arround the same time)
kernel 2.4.11 and kernel 2.4.12
(redhat 6.2 + updates)
is this a known problem that is fixed in later kernels ?
don't know the exact uptime anymore,
but i have an BitchX (irc client) running since arround the bootup
which shows :
| Client Uptime: 497d 18h 30m 20s
so maybe the uptime jumps back to zero at 497 days ?
current uptime on one machine shows :
 10:09am  up 18:24,  8 users,  load average: 0.61, 0.35, 0.23
(this machine runs 2.4.11)
the other machine (with 2.4.12) :
 10:11am  up 15:13,  2 users,  load average: 4.97, 4.84, 4.76
(load on this machine is also incorrect since yesterday (and top)
