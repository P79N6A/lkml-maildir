Thanks for sharing these numbers. I think use of a bitmap is one of 
those things which people have to configure to match their use, 
certainly using a larger bitmap seems to reduce the delays, using an 
external bitmap certainly help, especially on an SSD. But on a large 
array, without a bitmap, performance can be compromised for hours during 
recovery, so the administrator must decide if normal case performance is 
more important than worst case performance.
