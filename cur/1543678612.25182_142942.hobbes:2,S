I have tested the one from -ac2 now (2.0.0 from 25.03.03) and it works quite ok
on my laptop. I would be pleased to see it in 2.4.22 together with the acpi
stuff, sounds like a nice release for laptops ;-)
I found out SuSE uses a pretty old dated one (I guess it was 1.3.0 from
somewhen mid last year).

Stephan
