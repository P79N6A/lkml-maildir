 You may change a bit in the i8042 controller to make a BIOS assume that's
a cold boot.  The bit is zeroed (IIRC; apply a complement if my memory is
bad) upon a system RESET that's propagated to the i8042 (i.e. a power-on
or a button reset, but not a triple-fault or i8042 output port or port
0x92, etc. one).  The bit is set to one by a BIOS during POST and never
zeroed afterwards, but it's r/w, so there is no problem to clear it if
needed.  This should be quite a reliable way to reboot as a BIOS is
assumed to initialize hardware from scratch (regardless of the reset
vector used). 
 This assumes 100% PC/AT compatibility, of course, which need not be true
these days any longer.
