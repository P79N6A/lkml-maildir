I just hope that the implementation of one arch does not become a standard
without sufficient reflection. Could we first get an explanation of
the rationale of the offsets? From my viewpoint of the ia64 implementation
I have some difficulty understanding why such complicated things as
prescale and postscale are necessary in gettimeday and why the simple
formula that we use in gettimeofday is not sufficient?
Frankly, the direction that the design of the new time subsystem is
taking is bothering me. Work on this on our part would just improve the
situation from drastically worse performance to somewhat worse. So far I
have not seen a benefit of moving away from the existing code base. For
the project to make sense it needs at least to be evident that the design
of the solution would lead to better timer performance in the long run.
Conceptually that seems so far not to be possible.
I'd love simplication of the timer subsystem through the use of
nanosecond offsets. However, the POSIX api always has extra fields
for seconds and nanoseconds and converting back and forth between the
internal representation in 64bit nanoseconds and the POSIX structures may
be another performance penalty since it involves divisions and remainder
processing.
What I think is a priority need is some subsystem that manages
time sources effectively (including the ability of the ntp code to
scale the appropriately) and does that in an arch independent
way so that all the code can be consolidated. Extract the best existing
solutions and work from there.
