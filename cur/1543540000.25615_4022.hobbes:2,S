Anand!
I have a very pithy discuss with Petr Vandrovec about the cases of IPX
disconnection under Tulip driver and 2.4.0. The copies are sended to
linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.com under topic "POSSIBLE BUS: 2 cases of Tulip
IPX disconnection on work. If your hadn't get our letters challenge by
linux-kernel mailing list, I can send full copy to you.
During this discussion it  clarificated that for normal work it may be
nesessary to set some config parameters to Novell server.
I think about such Linux users who works in large companies and can't go
to server's concole fo set this parameters. So, I am a offer to Novell:
maybe, Novell can include to one of the next NW patches some module like
"Linux autodetection", to set needed server parameters automatically?
Futher, in this discuss it clarificated that some version of ncpfs has
bugs. By my mind, ncpfs has some other defects for usage. So, isn't it  a
time for Novell to produse original "NetWare Linux Client"? In the past
when I worked with WinNT I used exellent Novell's "NetWare WinNT Client" -
why it is unpossible to do such client for Linux?
And the last. Because I am not a programmer but a specialist in corporate
communucations, concurrent fight etc., so I can send the variant of this
offer by my line via respective Novell's department. I think it can be
additional argument for Novell's top manager to accept some variant
of offer. If your think that my offers if good and such extra way like that
will be helpful, sign me, pls.
 --  Sincerelly yourth,
