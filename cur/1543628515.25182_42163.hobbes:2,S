Correct.  Both NICs receive the arp request, only one of them actually sends a
reply.

I don't think there are any theoretical objections.  I'm pretty sure windows
will let you do it, but they don't give you nearly as much control over the
routing.
Without source routing or arp filter, traffic to any of the interfaces on the
same subnet can go through any of the interfaces on that subnet--whichever arp
reply gets there last is the winner.  This can be useful for quasi-redundant
type communications, but causes big problems if you're trying to monitor the
state of your network communications paths.  This is where the more strict
behaviour becomes useful.
