This one is going to be fun, since it's a hard reset back to bios, no
OOPS or anything shown.  It may be about the time RadeonFB kicks in,
but it's impossible to tell.  I'd guess 15-20 lines into dmesg.
I'm in the process of bisecting, currently 94c18227..d23cf676.
Any guesses of a specific patch to check?
