Hi Andrew,
nothing spectacular this time, mostly bugfixes, cleanups and support for new
card variants, plus the new Pluto2 driver. We also drop the skystar2 driver
which has been obsoleted by the flexcop-pci driver.
The patches apply fine against linux-2.6.12-git8 and linux-2.6.12-mm2.
Thanks,
Johannes
