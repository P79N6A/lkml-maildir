Given that there are about 60,000 printks in the kernel (and that's
not counting wrappers like dprintk() and other locally-defined
functions and macros) it would be a huge task to examine the code

(and thus should have an attached log level) and strings
that don't.

So, if this is a good idea, maybe the new version with the separate argument should have a new name? Then you can mechanically convert the onces that fit the pattern to the new name and form and leave the others to clean up later.
