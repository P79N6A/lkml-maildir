  I've been looking through the code and I think there might be a
following race (but it looks unlikely):
   Proc 1						Proc 2
 log_do_checkpoint()
   scans the list for buffers to flush
     and flushes everything
   scan again and throw out flushed buffers
							lock_bh_state()
   on the last buffer fails jbd_trylock_bh_state()
     so we retry
							unlock_bh_state()
							lock_buffer()
   scanning again but now buffer is buffer_locked()
     so we cannot throw it out
							mark_buffer_jbddirty()
							unlock_buffer()
   __cleanup_transaction() called
     It finds nothing wrong with the buffer (and
       there is only one) => return 0
   So we have drop_count==0, cleanup_ret==0 => assertion failure
   But in this case IMHO nothing bad happened so maybe the assertion is
just the problem but probably someone with more knowledge of this code should
decide (that's why I CC'd Andrew ;).
