That's a bit irritating, really.  It means that userspace needs to be
different for NUMA kernels (or more different, which is still bad).  Boot
into a non-NUMA kernel and whoops, no tmpfs and quite possibly no boot.
But last time I whined about this Albert had a list of fairly
reasonable-sounding reasons why filesystems shouldn't silently accept
not-understood options.
But in this case, we _do_ understand them.  We're just not going to do
anything about them.
I just wonder if we're being as friendly as we possibly can be to admins
and distro-makers.
