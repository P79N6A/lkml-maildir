Any particular reason why the new asm-m68k/*.h headers ended up under
asm-i386? :-)
I know this makes more work for you Alan, but all of these silly
errors (bogus reject files left in the tree, mistakedly leaving
vmlinux.lds autogenerated files in the tree, etc.) would have a
minuscule chance of surviving if you made prex-->prex+1 diffs yourself
and read them over carefully before each release.
I have to make these myself to merge my tree at each pre-patch and
this is how I find all sorts of errors like this one.
