Normally the process is you run 'make' from the root of the kernel
source tree.
The exact process you use to process a working binary depends on the
architecture you're running.  On my main box here (Dual PIII 1GHz), I
use something like:
$ make -j8 bzImage modules
When cross-compilling a kernel for my SGI Indy, I use:
$ make -j8 vmlinux modules CROSS_COMPILE=mips-unknown-linux-gnu-
Similar for my Gateway Microserver (rebadged Cobalt Qube 2):
$ make -j8 vmlinux modules CROSS_COMPILE=mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu-
To the others: What's happening with the Kernel HOWTO?  That guide
covered a lot about how to do this...?
Also, remember that you can use the -C argument to make, to tell it to
change directories first... e.g. 'make -C /path/to/kernel/source' will
do what you want without having to manually 'cd' first.
