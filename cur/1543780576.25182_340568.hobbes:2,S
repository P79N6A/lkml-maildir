Hello,
I have a Roland Sound Canvas SCP-55 pcmcia card ( midi synth, ports 330
& 200 ) which I want to write an alsa driver for.
I've searched but can't find anything about how to tell the new
pcmciautils to add the card.
Help on pcmciautils and/or where to look for info on adding a pccard to
it will be appreciated.
Thanks,
John Shillinglaw

soon as I can get ndiswrapper or my Netgear WG511 v3 to work with it...
