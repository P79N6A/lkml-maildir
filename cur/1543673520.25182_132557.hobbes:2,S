Neither is windows, OS2, MAC 5/6/7/8/9/10.. for that matter.

It does have audit trails... you do have to turn on process accounting. Are
they pretty... no. But it is equivalent to base Solaris (well, before 2). You
also have to turn on logs from every service daemon.

No current OS has C2 certifications - they have an EAL3 or 4. But not C2.

Real ACLs were available about 2-3 years ago. They just were not accepted
for inclusion, and the patch died.
First some organization has to come up with a good bit of $$$. Evaluations
are not cheap. It would take over a year to get an EAL3, and longer yet to
get 4.
