David,
I did test it with CONFIG_SECURITY disabled, but did not catch the warning 
-- I verified that the build completes with a valid vmlinux image.  There 
are many warnings (device drivers, and others) during the build and I 
didn't do a grep to find which one is specific to my patch.  Next time 
I'll do a diff on warnings too.
thanks,
Catherine
