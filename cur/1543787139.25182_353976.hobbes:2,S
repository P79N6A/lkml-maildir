HI all,
I observed there is huge network performance drop from linux 2.4 to 2.6 with
the same setup (No hardware changes..). The results are taken in PIV
processor with D-Link network card... with iperf ... Can some body help me
why such a huge difference... in TCP stream... 
In linux 2.4 (Redhat 9)
DLink	
    TCP              UDP
Tx       94.3Mbps    Tx               95 Mbps
Rx       94.2 Mbps   Rx               95 Mbps
In linux 2.6.10 (Fedora Core 4)
DLink	
	 TCP                     UDP
Tx       64.3 Mbps 	Tx               87 Mbps
Rx       88.1 Mbps      Rx               95 Mbps
Thanks & Regards
