Hello,
during or after the second (?) /dev/fd0 (floppy) access (mdir/mcopy/cp) or 
when I do a "sync" during the first access the whole system locks up. This 
only take place when the system is running in the third or fifth runlevel. 
When I start into runlevel one (init 1) it doesn't happen. Nothing in the 
logs.
System:
dual Athlon MP 1900+
MSI K7D Master-L (aka MS-6501, Rev 1.0, AMD 768MPX)
Linux 2.4.20 (-aa1) SMP
ACPI with or without AMD76x_pm module loaded
Thanks,
	Dieter
