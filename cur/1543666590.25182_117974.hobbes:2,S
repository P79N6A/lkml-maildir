Hi Richard,
Is the HUPCL cflags option (termio hang-up-on-close) asserted 
when the close happens? 
The "drop DTR and then wait a bit" behavior is requested by the 
HUPCL termio option. Otherwise, if CLOCAL is off, it is supposed 
to just drop DTR with no guarantee of holding it low for any 
particular amount of time. 
cheers,
Ed
