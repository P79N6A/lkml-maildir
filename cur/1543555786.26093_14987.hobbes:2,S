Now, how is say "Red Hat" (*) going to ship kernels? Of course they are
going to turn off debugging. Then I'll be stuck with a non-recompiling
user-in-trouble with a non-debugging-enabled kernel. 
Clients whom I have to tell "please read the kernel-howto" and
recompile your kernel. It's not that hard will not feel "good" about
this. It may seem easy to you, but from some people it is not.

(*) Even if I manage to convince Red Hat not to do this, some
distribution is going to claim that they distribute the "performance"
kernel, and disable debugging in the field.
