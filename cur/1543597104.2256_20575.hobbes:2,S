Subject: [PATCH] set serial_driver.name_base

Linus, Ted,
The following patch sets serial_driver.name_base so that devfs gives
us the correct names for the serial ports when we have a non-zero
SERIAL_DEV_OFFSET (as on powermacs).  It will be completely benign in
other situations since SERIAL_DEV_OFFSET is 0 there.
Thanks,
Paul.
