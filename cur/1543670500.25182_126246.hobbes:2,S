First: we are not talking about harddisks by any means.
Second: if it is doing _nothing_ while waiting for ide-whatever, then it is
presumably also not updating my mouse position or performing anything else
useful. This is _not_ the case here.
Third: a full-blown (1 channel) ISDN-download has around 8kBytes/sec of data.
The worst chipsets ever will create around 250 interrupts/sec for this (32 byte
fifo per hdlc-chunk). Don't count on the exact number, it may be some few more
than 250, but not a lot. This may have been a problem on very old boxes from
some years back, but for sure not on todays GHz monsters. You can only kill it
by completely braindead interrupt programming, which - I honor Alans' IDE stuff
quite a lot - I do not presume existing somewhere inside the current kernel.
Forth: There are parts in the ISDN code like:
static int
isdn_writebuf_stub(int drvidx, int chan, const u_char * buf, int len,
                   int user)
{
        int ret;
        int hl = dev->drv[drvidx]->interface->hl_hdrlen;
        struct sk_buff *skb = alloc_skb(hl + len, GFP_ATOMIC);
        if (!skb)
                return 0;
Used here:
		lock_kernel();
		...
                while (isdn_writebuf_stub(drvidx, chidx, buf, count, 1) != count)
                        interruptible_sleep_on(&dev->drv[drvidx]->snd_waitq[chidx]);
Which basically means we are looping around for some mem without telling anybody... or not?
This is probably not a very good example of what I mean, but nevertheless ...

You cannot issue that command to a DVD-writer used with ide-scsi.
