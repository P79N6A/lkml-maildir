And?  LiS is used, too as are tons of hacks that have no chance of
getting in mainline ever.

It's not about personal dislikes but about policies.  If we allow qlogic
to get their mpio code into the kernel there'll soon be more and more
HBA vendors who do the same.
And it's not like the code will vanish from earth if it's gone from
the mainline driver, if SuSE wishes to patch it back in to protect
the investments of their custorers (or insert random other CEO-speak
here) they're free to patch in the mess again.
