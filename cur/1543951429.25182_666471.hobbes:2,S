Right.  I can address the memory concerns with a kexec based approach
as they are core to kexec and completely orthogonal to the rest.
A kexec in done in two passes.  The first to load the target kernel
and do whatever memory allocation is needed.  The second to actually
switch which kernel is running.
Using a linux kernel to save off the image or in any other way be the
target is not required it is simply the sane thing to do in a general
implementation.  An embedded developer could likely implement a save
to disk routing in a couple of hundred lines of C and a couple of K
RAM if it was an important feature.

Yep.  Although disk storage is frequently less expensive, and more
readily available, so this is less of an issue.  Still it does suggest
that a dedicated partition likely will be required.

Yes.

I completely agree here.
