	Erm, except that because it can be determined by someone hacking
in, it means that some bad guy can potentionally determine part of your
passphrase.  This isn't good from a security view.  Admittedly, it's
probably unlikely they could break the passphrase in any reasonable
amount of time, but once they have part of it, it makes it easier for
them...
