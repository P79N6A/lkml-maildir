Have you tried it with 2.6.14? It has some new code to handle
high apic ids better

The timer is wired different on nvidia than on 8111. They can
go either through the 8259 or through the IOAPIC.  There is still
some code that falls back to the 8259 if IOAPIC doesn't work,
which may make it appear working on Nvidia.
As a warning I'm about to remove that code so don't rely on it.

They change when interrupt 0 fires. So it's probably misrouted
or similar.
