Hmm, that might be consistent with something going wrong with sleeping.
Was the system under high load? Perhaps something else can thrash
some real mode state when you sleep. On the other hand vm86 in user
mode can schedule anyways, so it might have already happened.
But I think the mutex was actually added post 2.6.16 so if you saw
it in 2.6.16 already it might have been something else.
Also when audit is not enabled (did you have it enabled?) the audit
function doesn't do very much?
If you can reliably reproduce it one way might be to comment
out more and more of the audit code until you find who causes
the corruption (that might cause some corrupted audit data,
but that should be fine for testing)
