Jasper,
But I was doing it all that I was doing with 2.4 i.e. the follwoing steps to build the kernel.
I also found these steps are followed in the 2.6.x kernel build howto's too.
Do you mean, to rebuild the 2.6.x kernel,
	make CC=<path of gcc> would be enough?
I am just thinking whether I am doing something redundent.
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
