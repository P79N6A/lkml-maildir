And what if the transport is *not* USB? Or they used
a similar firmware of their device server in another
product which used another transport?
I suggest that this device is blacklisted in that
SCSI Core would know that the ADDITIONAL LENGTH field
in the INQURY response is incorrectly set (to 0).
I.e. leave it to the interpreter.
A transport is *not* supposed to peek and poke in the
data it transfers!
