Actually, oprofile already does this somehow.  opcontrol --list-events
will tell you the perf counters for your particular CPU.  When my
scripts are deciding whether the machine is P3/4, they grep through this
list.
I think the proper way to do this is in oprofile itself.  John mentioned
earlier in this thread that they have considered doing default events,
but there may be a better way to do it.
