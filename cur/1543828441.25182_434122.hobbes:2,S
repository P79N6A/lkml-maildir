Hi Harry
Can you check which "high-res timesource" you are using?
In the kernel log look for:
  kernel: Using tsc for high-res timesource
  kernel: Using pmtmr for high-res timesource
I have experinced some network performance degradation when using the 
"pmtmr" timesource, on a Opteron AMD system.  It seems that the default 
timesource change between 2.6.15 to 2.6.16.
If you use "pmtmr" try to reboot with kernel option "clock=tsc".
On my Opteron AMD system i normally can route 400 kpps, but with 
timesource "pmtmr" i could only route around 83 kpps.  (I found the timer 
to be the issue by using oprofile).
Cheers,
   Jesper Brouer
