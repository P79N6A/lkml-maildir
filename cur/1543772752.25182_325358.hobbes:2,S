You got it!  It seems to be working just fine without it compiled into the 
kernel.

I think you hit it right on the head.
I enabled NUMA because I had anticipated upgrading later.  So I guess if you 
don't actually have NUMA set up hardware-wise, and enable this module, then 
you will have problems.
Maybe a simple update to the kernel "K8 NUMA support" Processor feature's help 
section should be made to note this?  Or, is there something that could be 
fixed somewhere.  I wouldn't mind helping, it was baffling me for two weeks.

Thanks for that too!
