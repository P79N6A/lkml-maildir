Ah thx,... is it in the vanilla kernel?
And do you know of any possible results that this issue has? When I just
read data (see my original stuff with fat32) is it possible that this
had been modified or damaged?
Or are the only consequences that diff errors occur?
And what is responsible for that parity errors? Is it possible that any
hardware is damaged?
Thanks,
Chris.
