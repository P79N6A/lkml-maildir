Hi
where I come from we say (jokingly of course) 'got a headache? chop
your own head ... end of problem'.
Though your system is not guaranteed to become more stable. When you
forbid overcommitting memory, all you do is make failure occur for ALL
processes at a different time. A process is happily doing something
useful when all of a sudden its fork may die due to 'out of memory'
... Moreover shutting down overcommit will do that for all processes,
not just the one culprit that could be chopped off by oom...
Maybe it is just me but I think with overcommiting a system works more
reliably :-)
