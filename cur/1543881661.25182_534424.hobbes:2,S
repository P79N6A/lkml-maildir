(We are talking "save 100% memory" here).
As I said, that one feature is doable in uswsusp, too. It is 200
lines. It also makes mm <-> swsusp interaction _way_ more complex, and
noone was able to review it. It will corrupt memory if we got it
wrong.
(Suspend2 has the same problem. It includes that same feature, and
noone is able to review it. It has few more problems.).

We do not want to fragment the testing base, and suspend2 does not
really have any interesting features over uswsusp.
