Can the new IP ROUTE stuff in 2.2 do ONE-ONE NAT insted of the standard
good ole MASQ (MANY-ONE)? I got hit with having to set up a nat solution
by Saturday AM, and it looks like Linux is the only thing that could hit
that deadline within budget.
I'll also need it to pass through port numbers unmolested. :( (stupid
state security). 
Getting this working would be a big victory for Linux in this enviroment,
so any assistance would be welcome.
Thanks,
