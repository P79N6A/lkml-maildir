Again this is the  "current"  diff :
 static inline struct task_struct * get_current(void)
 {
-       struct task_struct *current;
-       __asm__("andl %%esp,%0; ":"=r" (current) : "0" (~8191UL));
-       return current;
+       unsigned long *tskptr;
+       __asm__("andl %%esp,%0; ":"=r" (tskptr) : "0" (~8191UL));
+       return (struct task_struct *) *tskptr;
 }
that will probably resolve in something like:
movl %esp, %eax
andl $-8192, %eax
movl (%eax), %eax
