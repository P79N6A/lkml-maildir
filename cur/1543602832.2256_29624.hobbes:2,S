I find it the best in 2.4 series :)
Opening a nautilus window in a directory with 1600 pictures taht usually
made the system unusable (a laptop) now doesn't affect much.
An important remaining glitch for me is what happens when the system is
idle for some time, for instance after the screensaver has been running
during lunch time; it takes a few seconds moving from desktop to desktop
til it "swaps in" applications again. Maybe we are throwing away pages too
aggressively?
