For non ISA boxes we shouldn't be - but this old code. The IRQ for the
built in ports is defined by convention, in the BIOS PnP tables or with
ACPI in the ACPI tables. So we shouldn't even be autoprobing the IRQ.
We *do* have to wait one transmission timeout or so to detect buggy uarts
but in theory that could be moved down into the open path.
