While I guess a good caddy might put a lump of rubber in to help. But
there again I'm not sure if I have that much confidence in the DLT tapes
either; the instructions in the insert for HP DLT tapes tell you to
rattle them and listen to hear if you can hear anything loose
before putting them into your drive!
Anyway, from the side of data integrity the drop test doesn't worry me -
for critical data I have a lot more than one backup; and users perform
an important part of the backup test system by regularly deleting files
to be restored.
