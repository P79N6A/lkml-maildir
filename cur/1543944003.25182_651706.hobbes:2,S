sorry, git pull was hanging. it looks somewhat related to the kernel
version (debian 2.6.24-3), rebooting did not cure it.
i had also many problems with ssh, many (but not all) were
hanging. moreover X was very sluggish, as well as the network.  now i
am back to debian 2.6.23-2 and everything works correctly. odd.
regards,
Domenico
