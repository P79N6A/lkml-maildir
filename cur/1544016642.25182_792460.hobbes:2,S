Hello,
I installed 2.6.27.10 on monday. No problems arised since then, it seems
stable. I'm using r8169 built-in kernel driver instead of r8168 vendor
module. To be honest I'm not sure whether the problem was due to this r8168
driver, or it's simply that 2.6.18 is too much old for a modern PC (with
Quad core).
Thank you to all for your contribution, specially to Alistair.
Cheers,
-Roman
