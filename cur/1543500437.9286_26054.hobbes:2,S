I think this points out the real problem with this idea.
The protocol identifiers http:// , news://, etc. may look like fs roots, but
that's just the notation. They are really shells.
If you have the URI: 
http://foo.bar/baz/index.html
 and assume your shell
groks DNS & portnames that might translate to the *nixic:
foo.bar:http /baz/index.html
My point is that a network shell is different from a network file system, or
at least it ought to be. open() and family  is for files.

Tom
