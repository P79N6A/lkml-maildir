Dear Sir,
This is Kevin Wang from Areca Technology, Tech-Support Team.
regarding your problem, please trying to disable ACPI in kernel loader.
if the problem happen as soon as driver loaded, it should be the IRQ
releated issue.
the motherboard bios didn't assigned a correct IRQ to controller, it makes
the driver can't initialize controller.
and in our experience, disable ACPI in kernel loader can solved this ussue
in some distro.
Best Regards,
Kevin Wang
