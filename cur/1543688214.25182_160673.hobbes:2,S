Heavy parallel make throughput is still down a little over 10%, but X 
choppiness is markedly improved.  Test-starve is now working.  One thing 
that I noticed is that irman takes quite a bit longer to complete than with 
stock.  I've attached the results of that, plus some contest numbers.  My 
local variant of contest has a couple of differences to stock: dbench 
doesn't run so many instances, and list_load is just a small tree being 
md5summed.  There are two additional loads as well.  ab_load is an ancient 
apache bench jabbering with an also ancient apache (boring static page via 
localhost)... you can guess what irman2_load is :)
