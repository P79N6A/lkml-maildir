The tdfxfb driver has not too many features in the current kernel.
For example, it is restriceted to use 8 bit width fonts only...
You can enable this support by modifying the display_switch structs in the
tdfxfb.c. You need to replace all the
"fontwidthmask: FONTWIDTH(8)" with "fontwidthmask: ~1"
It may work, because it is implemented in the driver, just not tested yet.     
Or, if you need a better 3dfx support, you can use my driver.
