superset is hard, as a uid_t/gid_t is only superfically similar to a
windows SID. Samba has to do quite a lot of complex stuff to map
between general SIDs and posix IDs. It can't be done in any reasonable
fashion without being able to talk MSRPC to domain controllers, or at
least having a (potentially quite large) persistent database of
mappings.
The schemes that attempt to do general SID -> uid/gid mappings via
fixed algorithmic mappings are hopeless. They are great for toy demos,
but useless for real deployments.
Cheers, Tridge
