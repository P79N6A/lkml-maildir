The driver itself has to provide support for serial console.  If the USB
serial driver doesn't (I don't know) it won't work.  Check the config
options for USB serial, if it doesn't offer an option for console on USB
serial port then you're out of luck.
Unless the USB serial driver in some strange way hooks into the standard
serial driver, but then someone more knowledgeable should answer that
question.
