Don't know. The BIOS setup does not have a config option for 
this. 'hdparm -d /dev/hda' says it's not using DMA usually.
Compiling the kernel with or without 'Generic PCI bus-master
DMA support' did not change the problem.

The strange thing is that the primary partition table 
appears to be read proberly, but not the extended one at
the beginning of hda3, i.e. it is showing 
 p1 p2 p3 <hda: status error:
at the place where I usually get
 p1 p2 p3 < p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 p10 >
If the drive could not be read at all, it would not show the
first three entries either.

ok.

As I wanted to say in the original mail: I tried that but
was too lazy to clean up the rejects. Fortunately, it's not
urgent for me, so I can just wait for the next release.
Just tell me if you want me to try your fix.
