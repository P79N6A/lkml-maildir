What I meant was:  First revisions may have had incomplete OHCI 1.1
support and were sold as OHCI 1.0 chips, and as soon as they stabilized
it they sold them as OHCI 1.1 chips.  But that's mere speculation on my
part.  I can't think of any other reason though why anybody would hide
OHCI 1.1 compatibility.

And are you going to test if and how stable OHCI 1.1 features work?
(Which features are these?  Right now only dual buffer reception comes
to my mind.)
