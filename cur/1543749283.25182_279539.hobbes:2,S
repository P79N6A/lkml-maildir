The problem with adding domain support is that it'll break existing users, 
unless it's added on the side somehow.  One thought I had was to document 
that /proc/bus/pci/ contains only busses from domain 0.  Machines with more 
than 1 domain could create /proc/bus/pci/domain/DDDD directories with busses 
in the DDDD domain underneath.  That wouldn't break existing applications, 
and would let you get at domains other than 0 if you needed to.
