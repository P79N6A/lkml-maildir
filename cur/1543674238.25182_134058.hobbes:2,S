Check out [
http://www.trusteddebian.org/
].  They apply a bunch of kernel
patches like grsecurity.  Seems they have to recompile, repackage all
the .debs though.  
It is interesting to note that some of these patches introduce an
apparent non-determinism into userspace; the same inputs could result in
different outputs (the difference is that there are more inputs than
userspace can actually see).  So, maybe it could happen that you get a
segv from an off by 1, but when you rerun it, you can't reproduce it
because all the addresses are different.
In practice, this will eventually segv somewhere, and someone will find
the problem, but its something to consider.
