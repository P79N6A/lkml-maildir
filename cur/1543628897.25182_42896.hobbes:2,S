Good, at least one bug is fixed :)

Can you send me the version of OF you are using? You should be able to get
it off the bootup splash screen or by doing lsprop /proc/device-tree/openprom.
Do you get any errors in dmesg when the card stuffs up?

One thing to watch out for with the RS/6000 OF is that it wont reply
to ARP messages during a TFTP load. If you are trying to load a
big image you need to arp -s <hostname> <hw_addr>.
