I'd be interested in testing any fixes for the VIA Southbridge chip.  I have
an ASUS A7V133.  I was having problems with the IDE controller, but I've
switched to the on-board Promise IDE and it works fine.  I couldn't get rid
of the DMA timeout errors with my VIA vt82c686b, even with the latest
patches.  I even completely disabled DMA (through .config options) and I
although I didn't get DMA timeout errors anymore, everything still came to a
halt under heavy disk usage.
Would it be a good idea to form a small mailing list of people with VIA
chipsets (vt82c686b only)?  Then perhaps we could communicate with Vojtech
more easily, and the VIA southbridge problems might end a little quicker.
It seems like there are a bunch of people still having the VIA problems.
