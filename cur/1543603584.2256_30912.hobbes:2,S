Major size differences seem to depend upon the C compiler being
used.
Here are two different systems with exactly the same kernel
with exactly the same ".config" file.
The kernel on one is compiled with whatever comes with RedHat.
The other is compiled with egcs-2.91.66.
We are looking at the compressed size!  The actual expanded size
difference is about 2:1 !

It seems that, amongst other ethings, 2.96 aligns every function and
every memory variable on 16-byte boundaries, i.e., the offset address
lowest nibble is always 0. There doesn't seem to be any way to turn it
off.
So, if size counts, use egcs-2.91.66. It works okay with 2.4.x kernels.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
