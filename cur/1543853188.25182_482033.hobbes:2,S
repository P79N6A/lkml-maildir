Subject: make menuconfig regression in 2.6.19-rc

In commit 350b5b76384e77bcc58217f00455fdbec5cac594, the default menuconfig
color scheme was changed to bluetitle.  This breaks the highlighting
of the selected item for me with TERM=vt100.  The only way I can see
which item is selected is via:
    make MENUCONFIG_COLOR=mono menuconfig
Which restores the pre-2.6.19 white on black highlighting.  
Sam?
