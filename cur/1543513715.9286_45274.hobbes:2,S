Source code bloat is the least of anybody's worries.  Very few compile
many net drivers into a kernel image.  And for the modules case, only
that which is needed gets loaded, generally.

Yes, this is a problem:  no kernel maintainer for the net driver
subsystem.
If someone stepped up to fill this role, they can say tell the person
submitting a new am79c961a driver that support already exists in
lance.c.  Until such a thing happens, you will continue to see problems
like you describe.  Further, a net driver subsystem maintainer could
work with authors of existing modules to fold their duplicate code into
lance.c, tulip.c, etc.  That would get rid of a big complaint of yours.

The bottom line is that drivers don't make it into the standard kernel
all that often.  What can we change about the process to get test
releases into the kernel on a fairly regular basis?
No matter how much you test on your own, the user audience of the
standard kernels will always be far greater.  It will greatly benefit
the quality of your --already high quality-- drivers if kernels are
updated regularly.
