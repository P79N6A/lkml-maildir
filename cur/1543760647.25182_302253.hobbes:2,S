Hi,
We are from the Stanford Checker team and are currently developing a file
system checker call FiSC.  FiSC mainly focuses on finding crash-recovery
errors.  We applied it to FiSC and found a serious error where crash then
recovery cause the file system to contain loops.
To reproduce the warning, download and run our test cases at
http://fisc.stanford.edu/bug7/crash.c
 (for msdos)
http://fisc.stanford.edu/bug10/crash.c
 (for vfat)
you can also find the crashed disk images in the corresponding
directories.
We are not sure if these are bugs or not.  Your
confirmations/clarifications on this are well appreciated.
