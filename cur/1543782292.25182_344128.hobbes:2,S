Dear Lenneart,
One good news
I have implemented the partition support in the driver.
I am able to mount the partition of the individual device.
I partition them using the fdisk and mounted them.
The architecture this some thing like this
The whole device is represented by tfa0
And rest of the partitions by tfa0p1, tfa0p2 and so on...
If there is a device in second socket, the whole device is represented
by tfa1 and rest of the partitions by tfa1p1, tfa1p2 and so on... I am
following the above conventions. Is the is what in general all Linux
devices follow. 
I have four sockets on which I have to support individual device with
partitions on them. Is there a better conventional way to represent all
the four devices? My driver also supports 4 such controllers. To support
first socket device on the second controller I am using tfb0, tfb0p1,
tfb0p2...
I have left with handling lot of generalization in the code.
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
