Well, from what I know 'tulip' driver in later 2.4 kernels simply does
NOT work with any of my tulip cards, on x86 or on alpha, with a version
higher that something like 0.9.14a (which was yet in 2.4.6-ac4, I think;
I may have versions details wrong at this moment and would have to do
some digging to be sure).  In other words its performance is unable to
drop any lower does not matter what I will do.
I reported that a few times in the past, including dumps of PCI
registers and other diagnostic information, but I was never dignified
even with "Yes, noted, and maybe later ..." response.
There were other posting with similar reports so it does not look like
that I am unique in that position.  I am just using 'de4x5' driver
instead but I never had problems with 'tulip' in 2.2 series.
