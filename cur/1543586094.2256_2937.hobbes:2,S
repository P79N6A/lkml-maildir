Opening up the latest networking postal spam here at the office, I see that
there are suddenly several sub-$200usd gigabit nics now available. 
Some of the products seem so new that their manufactuors have little to no
information available about them on their webpage. One that I found, had
conflicting specs and claimed to only have a 32kbyte recieve buffer.
They all seem to claim Linux support.
Anyone benchmark any of these new gigabit cards under Linux?
