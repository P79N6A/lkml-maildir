Thanks - This is a part of new cifs code recently added to handle posix 
locks (it has not pushed to mainline yet) better
                down(&pSMBFile->lock_sem);
                list_for_each_entry_safe(li, tmp, &pSMBFile->llist, llist) {
                        list_del(&li->llist);
                        kfree(li);
                }
                up(&pSMBFile->lock_sem);
My guess is that there is a path in which the lock_sem is not 
initialized - will trace that.
