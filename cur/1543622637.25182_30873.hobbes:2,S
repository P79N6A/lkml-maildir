Hi all,
I just sent off a bunch of PCI Hotplug patches for 2.4.19-pre1 and
thought I would post a pointer to them here (the patches are too large
for this mailing list.)
 - Clean up the pcihpfs filesystem code and add support for updating the
   timestamp of the device attribute files when the information has
   changed.
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/hotplug/2.4/pci_hp-core-2.4.19-pre1.patch
 - Add the PCI Hotplug API to the kernel-api documentation build
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/hotplug/2.4/pci_hp-docs-2.4.19-pre1.patch
 - Some small Compaq PCI Hotplug driver fixes
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/hotplug/2.4/pci_hp-cpqphp-2.4.19-pre1.patch
 - Add support for an IBM PCI Hotplug driver.  This was written by Irene
   Zubarev, Tong Yu, Jyoti Shah, and Chuck Cole, with a bit of help from
   me.
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/hotplug/2.4/pci_hp-ibmphp-2.4.19-pre1.patch
 - Add support for an ACPI PCI hotplug driver.  This was written by
   Hiroshi Aono and Takayoshi Kochi, with a bit of help from me.
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/hotplug/2.4/pci_hp-acpi-2.4.19-pre1.patch
 - Add the ACPI and IBM PCI Hotplug drivers to the build
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/hotplug/2.4/pci_hp-build-2.4.19-pre1.patch
thanks,
greg k-h
