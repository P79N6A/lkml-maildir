With your patch automount will happen on every reference to dentry.
Regardless of the namespace we are in.

And how would they do it?  You get mount triggered by stepping on dentry.
Period.  Your kern_automount() will then create a new vfsmount and slap
it on the tree.  Again, regardless of the namespace we are in / vfsmount
we are looking at / etc.
I have two namespaces.  One of them has filesystem A mounted on /usr/include.
Another - on /usr/local/include.  The first one wants /usr/include/foo1 trigger
mounting B and /usr/include/foo2 trigger mounting C.  The second one wants
/usr/local/include/foo1 trigger mounting D and /usr/local/include/foo2 not
trigger anything.
Namespaces are completely unrelated - I have them set for two different
users that happen to need some common files, but otherwise have very
different environments.  Could you describe what that "having to change
things" would involve?
