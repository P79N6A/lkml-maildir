Hi Mikael!
Hi Marcelo!
stumbled repeatedly over the patches (or what remained of them)
from Mikael?, replacing task->processor and friends by inline
functions task_cpu(task), to eliminate them on UP systems ...
my questions: 
 - is there an up to date patchset?
 - is it planned to include this into 2.4.23?
TIA,
Herbert
