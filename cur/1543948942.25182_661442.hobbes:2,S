It's slightly different -- I didn't use any existing semaphore
implementation for inspiration (though I did write the parisc one,
so I couldn't help but be influenced).  I was much more influenced
by mutex.c.  After I'd posted it the first time, dhowells pointed out
it was essentially the same as FRV's implementation.

As always, the major cost is getting the cacheline exclusive on this
CPU.  I'd be surprised if you can measure the difference.

I can change that.  I'll modify the git tree, unless anyone has any
complaints.  We should fix mutex.c at the same time:
static void noinline __sched
__mutex_lock_slowpath(atomic_t *lock_count);

It's not something I feel strongly about ;-)

Fine.

__up_down_common is always called while holding the spinlock.  The
spinlock is acquired by the waiter before it checks the flag.  If
there's a race here, I question the value of spinlocks at all.

It's a mirror of __mutex_lock_common ... I don't believe it's justified
in one case and not the other.
