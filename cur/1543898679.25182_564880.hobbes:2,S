If you don't do _STM first, it basically boils down to reading BIOS
setting during boot.  Over suspend/resume cycle, the values are
preserved by libata-acpi.  At this point, I think honoring the BIOS
setting is the right thing to do.  It just took us too long and I'm not
too sure about using ACPI for this.  It's generic so it's certainly
better in some aspect.  It's just a bit obfuscating, IMHO.
