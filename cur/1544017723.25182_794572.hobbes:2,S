I'm not sure which one-liner you're talking about.  In fact,
the patch I'm looking at right now isn't the one i looked at
before my last response.  Dangit.
The patch turning the cached pid_t into a struct pid is
certainly mostly right.  It shouldn't store a pid_t.
But as for passing pid_t's in from userspace and especially
printing them out in error messages, I believe what Ian was
trying to do before, which seemed sensible, was to always
use values in the init_pid_ns.  After all, if you do a DPRINTK
with pid_vnr(somepid), then by the time a human reads the logs
the subjective pidns might no longer exist.  So for logs I'd
tend to agree with printing out the pid_t in the init_pid_ns.
