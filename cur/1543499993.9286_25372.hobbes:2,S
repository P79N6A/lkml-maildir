The following things are new and improved:
    It now requires much less in the way of changes to the hosting
    kernel.  2.0 kernels require a two-line patch.  It ought to run on
    unchanged 2.2 kernels, although I haven't tested this.
    It is noticeably faster.  It still won't win many benchmarks,
    though.
    There is a web page (
http://www.mv.com/ipusers/karaya/uml/uml.html
)
    describing it with links to the various things that can be downloaded.
    There are a ready-made root filesystem and a binary distribution
    available.  If you just want to play with it and don't feel like
    building from source, these two items will get you going.
The actual changes that were made involved getting fault information
from the sigcontext_struct that's on the stack in the seg fault signal
handler, rather than from /proc/[pid]/fault and doing system call
forwarding using ptrace rather than an exec_domain module.
