 How big is the actual degradation in your test? IIR, Ingo is afraid
that the tunables could easily screw things up, which of course is true.
What about adding a kernel-build option that leaves the sysctl interface
read-only by default and enables writing only if it is requested at
build time?
 That way the external interface stays constant.
