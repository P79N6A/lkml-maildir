Good point...
My first thought would be to add a paragraph saying what happens
on a UP for call_rcu() and synchronize_kernel(), something like
for call_rcu():
	This primitive has the same effect on a UP system.
	For example, if an RCU read-side critical section
	is interrupted by a handler that invokes call_rcu(),
	the corresponding update function will be invoked
	some time after the RCU read-side critical section
	has completed, which will in turn be some time after
	the interrupt handler returns.
Does this seem reasonable?
						Thanx, Paul
