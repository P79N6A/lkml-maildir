Apart from this I think something is still off on x86_64. I have not
been able to make kdump work on x86_64. Second kernel simply hangs.
Two different machines are showing different results.
- On one machine, it seems to be stuck somewhere in decompress_kernel().
  Serial console is not behaving properly even with earlyprintk(). Somehow
  I feel it is some bss corruption even after my changes.
- Other machines seems to be going till start_kernel() and even after
  that (No messages on the console, all serial debugging) and then
  either it hangs or jumps back to BIOS.
Will look more into it.
Thanks
Vivek
