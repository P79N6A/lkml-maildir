Yeah, I get that a lot.

Right. My point was that if you wanted to use the gzip/gunzip
example of a file with two names being treated differently based
on the name accessed as an argument for AppArmor you could. If
you don't want to, that's ok too. Jeremy raised a reasonable objection,
and AppArmor could address it if y'all chose to do so. I seriously
doubt that enforcing the argv[0] convention would break much, and I
also expect that if it did there's a Consultant's Retirement to be
made fixing the security hole it points out.
