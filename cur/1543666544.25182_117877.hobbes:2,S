No delay should be necessary. Machine B should see the data that A
wrote.

Nope.
However the Linux 2.4.x NFS server has a known bug/feature that may
affect things: because the mtime only has a 1 second resolution,
changes that occur within < 1 second of one another may not cause
mtime to be updated.  When this occurs, the NFS client has no way to
tell that the file has changed.
This limitation no longer exists in Linux 2.5.x...
Cheers,
