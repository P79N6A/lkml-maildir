Hmm. Please keep an eye on this. If there is something going funky
either in accessing the PM Timer hardware on your chipset, or some other
quirk (locking issues, timer starvation, etc) it would be good to
discover.

If the ACPI PM timer is enabled it should be used by default (is that
not the case? if you do not use clock= at all, what clocksource gets
selected?). Unfortunately using the TSC on some SMP systems is just not
feasible.
