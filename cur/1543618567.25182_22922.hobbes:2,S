Software RAID .. Yes
System got two:
vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
model name	: Pentium III (Coppermine)
cpu MHz		: 868.671
cache size	: 256 KB
It's an ASLab system with 4 Ultra100 Cards each with 4 80G maxtor
drives.  So with the video and network card the PCI slots are full.
The raid tools are raidtools-0.90-9mdk as shipped with Mandrake 7.2.
