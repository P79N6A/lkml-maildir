Admins already know what "tmpfs" means, so you should just call
your filesystem that. I know it isn't a pretty name, but in the
interest of reducing confusion, you should use the existing name.
Don't think of it as just "for /tmp". It is for temporary storage.
The name is a reminder that you shouldn't store archives in tmpfs.
Again for compatibility, Sun's size option would be useful.
-o size=111222333      Size in bytes, rounded up by page size.
-o size=111222k        Size in kilobytes (base-2 or ISO standard?)
-o size=111m           Size in megabytes (base-2 or ISO standard?)
I'd prefer k for ISO standard and K for base-2.
Of course m isn't millibytes, but that isn't horrible.
