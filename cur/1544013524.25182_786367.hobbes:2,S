I should point out that we really *should* use same kind of techniques
on 64 bits as well.  Even though the likelihood of overflow is much less
there (and the use of the LCD reduces it further) it is nonzero.
However, the places that were most seriously affected were all operating
on 32-bit input (int), and therefore the overflow-free 64-bit code never
got written.
