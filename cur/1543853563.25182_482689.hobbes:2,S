No! invalidate_inode_pages2() is supposed to be non-destructive w.r.t.
dirty pages. That is why it calls try_to_release_page(). If you want a
destructive truncate, then you should be calling truncate_inode_pages().

I would assume so.

If you do, then you will either have to get rid of the call to
nfs_clear_request(), or track the struct page yourself.
At this point, I think that removing the call to nfs_clear_request is
safe: there should be nothing that checks page_count() in the mm layer
that we can race with AFAICS.
