   Turned out the 32bit ptrace unlazy FPU path shared two lines too many
   with with the 32bit signal FPU saving path and was resetting the
   used_fpu flag. Result was that the FPU state of the child could be
   reinitialized in some circumstances on ptrace accesses.
So what it depended upon was the FP control register state,
not the state of the individual FPU registers, across fork()
right?
