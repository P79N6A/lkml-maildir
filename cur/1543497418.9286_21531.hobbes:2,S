AFAIK, this is an incompatibility between Communicator 4.xx and the
newer glibc systems; It really started to get out of hand for me when I
upgraded to glibc 2.1.
Since Netscape only releases binaries, they just can't keep up with the
changes to the Linux system. I remember when this same type of problem
was happening with early Communicator 4.x betas on 2.0.xx systems.
I'm hoping that Mozilla stabilizes quickly...
