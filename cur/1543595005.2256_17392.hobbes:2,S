QNX does not have any difference between user-space and kernel space.
It's not paged-virtual. It's just one big sheet of address space
with no memory protection (everything is shared). All procedures
to be executed are known at compile time.
Therefore, any piece of code can do anything it wants including
handling hardware directly. In fact, that's what QNX was designed
for.

Not if that memory can get swapped or paged out .

Then you are stretching the meaning of "OS" just a bit. It's
true that I can make an Operating System  entirely in interpreted
BASIC. However, it is really only a "Command Processor" even
though it can have multiple "connections" requesting commands
to be processed.
