Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Allow more than PAGESIZE data read in configfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/10/264

Currently, maximum amount of data that can be read from a configfs
attribute file is limited to PAGESIZE bytes. This is a limitation for
some of the usages of configfs.
This patchset removes that limitaion by using seq_file for read operations
instead of using locally allocated buffer.
Tested the interface change with configfs_example.c in the Documentation
directory.
