via "shutdown -r" or "reboot" from util-linux or via Sysrequest-Keys

you will notice that the reboot method is unrelated to the problem.

Nice, but not relevant to the problem.

As I pointed out in my former mails: what hangs is the assembler code
called from machine_restart() -- this is the exact point of failture.
But the reason for the problem must be somewhere else, for the
failing rebootcode hasn't changed since 2.4.x which reboots on my
system just fine.
