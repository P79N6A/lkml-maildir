I don't think anybody's going to be able to shoot that bug report without more
info.  "seems like frozen" doesn't give us much to go on.  Does the machine
still ping/ssh/etc on the net?  Is it totally locked up?  Any disk activity
lights left on/flickering, indicating life? Can you get a serial console or
kgdb-ethernet or something to see if there's an oops/panic?

Well, the 53.36 drivers are rock-solid on my Dell laptop with a GeForce4 440Go
and the 2.6.3-rc1-mm1 kernel.  There very well may be bugs in there, but
they're not ones I can replicate or diagnose...
