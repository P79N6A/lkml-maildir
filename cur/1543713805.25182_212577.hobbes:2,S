A conv=fsync option is an irrelevant wishlist item.  If you were to provide
conv=fsync then dd should still fsync the file after performing the
direct-io read or write.
You're correct that an fsync after a direct-io read or write should not
need to perform any file data I/O.  But it will often need to perform file
metadata I/O - file allocation tables, inode, etc.  direct-io only syncs
the file data, not the file metadata.
