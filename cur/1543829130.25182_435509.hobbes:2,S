Yes, lockdep uses the callsite of spin_lock_init() to detect the "type" of
a lock.
But the ACPI obfuscation layers use the same spin_lock_init() site to
initialise two not-the-same locks, so lockdep decides those two locks are
of the same "type" and gets confused.
We had earlier decided to remove that ACPI code which kmallocs a single
spinlock.  When that's done, lockdep will become unconfused.
AFACIT it's all used for just two statically allocated locks anwyay.
