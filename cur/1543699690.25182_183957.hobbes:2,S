Subject: [PATCH][2.6] HPFS: missing lock_kernel() in hpfs_readdir()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus,
recently the BKL was pushed from vfs_readdir() into the filesystem
specific functions. But only the unlock_kernel() made it into the HPFS
code, lock_kernel() got lost on the way. This rendered the filesystem
unusable.
The patch below adds the missing lock_kernel(). It's been tested by Timo
Maier who also reported the problem earlier today.
Please apply.
Thanks,
René
