Yes; this is why it is illegal to sleep, or to switch CPUs by any means
while holding an atomic kmap:
	kmap_atomic(...);
	__copy_*_user(...);
	kunmap_atomic(...);
the kmap_atomic() will increment the preempt count (even on CONFIG_PREEMPT=n).
- The incremented preempt count pins this code path onto this CPU
  while the kmap is held. (This is only relevant to CONFIG_PREEMPT=y)
- The incremented preempt count tells do_page_fault() that we cannot
  handle a pagefault; if a fault is encountered during the copy_*_user(),
  do_page_fault() will arrange for the __copy_*_user() to return a short
  copy.
So.  The code path is atomic, and is pinned to a single CPU.  The atomic
kmap pool uses a different batch of virtual addresses for each CPU (it's
a per-CPU pool of addresses).
