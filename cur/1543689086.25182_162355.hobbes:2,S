Not necessarily. A binary driver still needs to be compiled for a specific 
version of a kernel. And, if it's not already working, the new driver 
model definitely won't help. :)

No, it will not reduce usage of modules. The driver model has nothing to 
do with whether something is compiled as a module or not.

This is a loaded question, but ultimately it's a vendor issue. Most people 
do and will use vendor kernels. What they do with their kernel interfaces 
and how well they support binary modules is their beef.
