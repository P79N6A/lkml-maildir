Hi,
i'm using linux 2.5.75 on my debian box and want to run lm_sensors. The
userspace apps (sensors-detect & sensors) require the module I2C_PROC,
which I can't find within the kernel configuration. Are there any
dependencies so I2C_PROC becomes available? I'm thankful for any
enlightment. 
For I'm not subscribed to the list, please cc me on reply.
Thanks in advance 
Sven
