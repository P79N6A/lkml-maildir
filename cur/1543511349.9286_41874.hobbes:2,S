Now, it is time to look into code yet. And you will find that coding style
is amusingly uniform and naming conventions are so strict as it is possible.
The style may be bad, but it is unformly bad then 8)8)
BTW the talk was not about identifiers. But if you are stick on
improving identifiers, then take into account historical aspect.
F.e. nothing in the world would force me to initiate rename "struct sk_buff"
or file skbuff.h or change of name for skb_put(). These names were given
them by their parents and nobody have rights to change them.
Actually, even parents lost this right, these names lives by their own
life for long time.
