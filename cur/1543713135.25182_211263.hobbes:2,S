that's because I must leave page->index free for the anon-vma tracking.
Now an anonymous page while being swapped is just like a pagecache page,
however the index on swap is different than the index in-address-space,
because the swap is nonlinear. So I need to indexes, one for finding the
page in the anon-vma in the task address space (page->index), the other
(the swap-entry) for finding the page in the swap address-space
(swapcache, or disk).

hugetlb is never swapped so yes, it cannot generate problems. The only
thing swapping a compound page is swap suspend and that's why we didn't
notice it yet.

I wouldn't like to reduce the hardness checks in the radix tree, I was
very happy to find this robusteness checks trapping those bugs so
reliably.
But I think the compound thing is overkill for 99% of usages, hugetlbfs
is the only one really needing that sort of transparency in the
refcounting I believe, so I'm now adding a __GFP_NO_COMP that
swapsuspend will start to use to allocate the multipages, I'd better add
it before somebody gets the idea of removing the order parameter to
free_pages (something you could do just fine with page compound since
the order is in page[1].index ;). This should fix it, I don't want to
teach rw_swap_page_sync how to swapout a compound page, I'd rather make
a compound page look like a regular page as far as rw_swap_page_sync is
concerned. This will not slowdown the kernel at all since the additional
check if to create a compound page or not will only trigger if the
previous check of order > 0 is positive.
