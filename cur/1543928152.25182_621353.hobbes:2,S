Something about this doesn't sound right.
When you have CONFIG_USB_PERSIST enabled, do you remember to turn on 
the Persist feature for the root fs device by writing a "1" to the 
device's power/persist file in sysfs?
Can you try building a kernel with CONFIG_USB_PERSIST and 
CONFIG_USB_DEBUG both enabled, and post the dmesg log from immediately 
after resuming?
