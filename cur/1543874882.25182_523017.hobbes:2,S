Generally I think this looks good.  However there is a lot here, and some
of it potentially at least has some pretty subtle side effects.
So reviewing all of these patches at once is almost certain to cause
something important to be missed :(
Can we slow this process down a few days by taking this one logical chunk
at a time?
i.e.  First the simple bug fixes that should purely be restructure of
msi.c with no affect on anything outside of it.
And then get into the architecture enhancements.
