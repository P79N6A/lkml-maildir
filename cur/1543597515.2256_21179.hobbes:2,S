I'm sure this has been given thought, so I want to probe teh collective
resources.  We need to have users in more than 32 groups.  In fact, they
may need to be a member of MANY more groups than that.
What is the current thinking on this problem?  Would it be desirable to
replace current->groups[NGROUPS] with a poibnter to an array?  Thus
allowing (with libc changes) many more groups?
Comments, please.
Tim
