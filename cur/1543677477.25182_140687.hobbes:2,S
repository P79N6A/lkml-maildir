Hi!
This thing has been biting me now and again.  "cramfs: wrong magic\n"
looks like an error condition to most people and thus creates bug
reports.  But there is no bug per se in having cramfs support in the
kernel and booting from a jffs2 rootfs.  So instead of teaching the
users over and over, how about this little one-liner?
