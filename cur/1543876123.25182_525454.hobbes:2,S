Well.  Presumably that hardware will be in the field during the lifetime of
2.6.21-based kernels.
Perhaps we should put this into 2.6.22 then backport it to 2.6.21.x once it
seems safe to do so.  If we decide to go this way, we'll need to ask Mitch
to remind us to do the backport at the appropriate time, else we'll surely
forget.
