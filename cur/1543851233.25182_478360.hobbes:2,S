beancounters may be implemented above any (or nearly any) userspace
interface, no questions. But we're trying to come to agreement here,
so I just say my point of view.
I don't mind having file system based interface, I just believe that
configfs is not so good for it. I've already answered that having
our own filesystem for it sounds better than having configfs.
Maybe we can summarize what we have come to?
