There's a lock, so only one communication happens at a time, and all
communication is request-response, so it's pretty straightforward.
But an alternate implementation would be to have a "kthread" kernel
thread, which would actually be parent to the kthread threads.  This
means it can allocate and clean up, since it catches *all* thread
deaths, including "exit()".
What do you think?
Rusty.
