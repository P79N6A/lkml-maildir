The thing that confused me here was the help text in menuconfig.  The help for
CONFIG_I82365 says, "Say Y here to include support for PCMCIA and CardBus host
bridges that are register compatible with the Intel i82365 and/or the Yenta
specification: this includes virtually all modern PCMCIA bridges."  Also, the
help text for both this option and CONFIG_CARDBUS say, "If unsure, say Y," so I
selected both of them.  It wasn't until Jeff Garzik set me straight recently
that I began disabling CONFIG_I82365 and using CONFIG_CARDBUS alone.

i82365 is for use only on PCMCIA bridges, not CardBus. It should not be
'retired' but should probably have the config option renamed to prevent
confusion.
