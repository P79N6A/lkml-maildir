do you mean this paragraph:
| 1) as you said you knew about this bug - which bug causes more 
| inlining overhead than hundreds of your uninlining patches combined. 
| The bug was introduced ~2 years ago in -mm - before the feature hit 
| mainline in v2.6.16.
sorry, but i know of no rule of grammar that could read your 
interpretation into my two sentences.
(and that's not surprising at all, because i never intended to even 
suggest that you knew about this breakage "before it went mainline" - 
why would i even care about such a detail?)
