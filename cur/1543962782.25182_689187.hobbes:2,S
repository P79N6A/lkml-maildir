In short:
mixing all together and applying resolving and UI heuristics on top.

No need to hide anything and invent complexity. Flexible and
human-friendly interface. (Batch things like def_condig are done by
humans, randconfig -- useless if there's no heuristics, allyes - simple.)
Just UI part for now. Automation of selection can be applied only, after
one can see whole picture. Say, you have [ UCcamers ] which depends on
USB, Video, etc.

So, after 'go <' command (visually or command-lineually) we will be in

== [ rant ] ==
Can some of those PS3 or KDE teams design proper "Konfigure Linux"
game for kernel hackers? I try to do this with TERM=linux, `sh`, and
`sed`. Patching paper work isn't for such tasks.
On collecting CONFIG_ info by gcc in sources, thus generating symbol
dependency automatically, was told to shut up. Let's see what will
happen next. Don't forget to use cultural skills, imagination and
creativity.
