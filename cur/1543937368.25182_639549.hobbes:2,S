You are now calling lock_kernel() twice in case of ext2_compat_ioctl(),
which calls back into ext2_ioctl with the BKL already held.
This is allowed with the BKL, but really bad style that you should
avoid. I assume the ext3 and ext4dev versions of your patch have
the same issue, but I didn't check in detail.
