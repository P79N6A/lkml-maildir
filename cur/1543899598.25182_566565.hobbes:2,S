If that's the intention, please use __always_inline instead.

In C99 (and therefore in gcc >= 4.3), "extern inline" means that the 
function should be compiled inline where the inline definition is seen, 
and that the compiler should also emit a copy of the function body with 
an externally visible symbol.
