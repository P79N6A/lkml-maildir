Well truncate/invalidate will not operate on mapped pages (barring the
very-unlikely truncate/invalidate vs fault races). We can ignore those
filesystems as they don't include ext3. Which brings us back to
try_to_free_buffers().
Maybe it is something else entirely, but did try_to_free_buffers ever
get completely cleared? Or was some of Andrei's corruption possibly
leftover on-disk corruption from a previous kernel?
