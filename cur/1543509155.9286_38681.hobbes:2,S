Not with spinlocks.  Which is to say that:
	a) a process may never block while holding a spinlock
	b) an interrupt context may never end while still holding a
	   spinlock
I'm not too sure what the debugging spinlock code does wrt these
invariants, but checking a local lock depth wouldn't be too difficult.
