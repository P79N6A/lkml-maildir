/proc/modules size field includes init_size in 2.5. Why ?
The removal of sensible values in /proc/ksyms means that oprofile can no
longer attribute module samples reliably. The only information we have
is module_core address, and size == core_size+init_size. Since init code
is removed in sys_init_module, this will overestimate, and can lead to
overlapping with the start of another module, afaics.
In 2.4, we had size(.text), which could underestimate (think
.text.exit), but that is not a big problem.
Rusty, does this fall under another one of your "corner cases" ? (what I
would call "flaky code" ...)
Or I have I just missed something obvious ?
