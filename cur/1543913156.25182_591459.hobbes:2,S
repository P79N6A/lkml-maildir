There are other enforceability issues as well. For instance in the
US, Copyright Law applies as soon as something is written. So,
does Copyright Law apply if I write, "You cannot read this."
Of course, it's a trivial example. Revocation of a license to
read a work is absurd. Using this theory, once somebody's
written "work" has been distributed under some license, a
different license would likely be regarded as unenforceable
by a court.
