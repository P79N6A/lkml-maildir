yeah, sounds good.
One thought:
BUG_ON()'s do_exit() shows a slightly misleading failure pattern to users: 
instead of a 'hanging' task, we'd get a misbehaving app due to one of its 
tasks exiting spuriously. It can even go completely unnoticed [users dont 
look at kernel logs normally] - while a hanging task generally does get 
noticed. (because there's no progress in processing)
So instead of the BUG_ON() we could emit a WARN_ONCE() perhaps, plus not 
do any spinning and just block - resulting in an uninterruptible task 
(that the user will probably notice) and a scary message in the syslog? 
[all in the slowpath]
So in this case WARN_ONCE() is both more passive (it does not run 
do_exit()), and shows the more intuitive failure pattern to users. No 
strong feelings though.
