This quirk will cause breakage for people who used an external PCI
soundcard with these boards - the builtin sound chip which was
invisible before may become the first audio device.
It also enables the MC97 device, which does not really work (there is
no MC97 codec attached to the controller at least on A8V Deluxe; I'm
not sure if there is some other variant of this board which has MC97,
but it seems unlikely).
