At common speeds you never have more than one
buffer on the queue when the function in question is called.
So looking at the head is the same as looking at the tail.
In my recent testing, I cranked the speed up and at 460800bps
the queue became corrupted when more than one buffer was pending.
This is the important part of the patch.
With this patch, I've been running multiple devices (synclink_gt)
simultaneously on an SMP machine from 38400bps to 921600bps and
the new buffering is solid.
The part of the patch in flush_to_ldisc closes a tiny hole
where an ISR might access the queue tail after flush_to_ldisc
has removed it from the queue.
