Remember the old days when AT&T was pushing SYSV as the only way to
unix.  Some of the vendors put a flag into the u area that indicated
whether the process in question got SYSV or BSD behavour when it
performed various actions (like making files etc).
Could you have something like that, that specified that opening a file
gave the entire file such that a copy would still be a multipart file.
Then you could run your tar/cpio/cp  as 'nomultipart tar zcf - mydir'
and nomultipart would set the magic bit so that reading a file got all
of the blocks, not the main stream.
This doesn't work for cp/mv unless the os can tell that an incoming
stream of blocks (when in nomultipart mode) is in fact a multipart
file and does whatever we chose to do to indicate that it is a new
multipart file etc.
dump and it's ilk wouldn't get it since they read the raw bits but
they have to be modified anyway if the fs changes.
