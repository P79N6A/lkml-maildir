It's both a process id and a Coda thingy :) It should have been pid_t,
but if you change it in the kernel it will break precompiled binaries in
userspace which still assume it is a 16-bit value. It is not used too
often, only when a process is forked off for conflict resolution.
Luckily, I'm getting close to finalizing a new version of Coda's
userspace which has support for realms (or cells, or whatever other
distributed filesystems like to name it) that already has to break
the kernel-venus interface. So I'll add this to my list of incompatible
changes that can go into the patch.
