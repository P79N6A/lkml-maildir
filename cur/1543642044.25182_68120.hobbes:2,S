This is exactly what Lustre is supposed to be.  Many nodes, each with
local storage, and clients are able to do I/O directly to the storage
nodes (for non-local storage, or if they have no local storage at all).
There is (currently) a single metadata server (MDS) which controls the
directory tree locking, and the storage nodes control the locking of
inodes (objects) local to their storage.
It's not quite in a robust state yet, but we're working on it.
Cheers, Andreas
