Subject: Re: [PATCH] updated reiser4 - reduced cpu usage for writes by writing more than 4k at a time (has implications for generic write code and eventually for the IO layer)

Hi!
I'm actively using Reiser4 on a production servers (and I know a lot
of people that do that too).
Could you please release the patch against the vanilla tree?
I don't think there's a lot of people that will test -mm version,
especially on production servers - -mm is a little bit too unstable.
Thanks.
