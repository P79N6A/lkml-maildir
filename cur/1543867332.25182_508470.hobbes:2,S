Yes, but that is what you need to do to compile Xen - logically, to 
build a Xen kernel, you need to have a kernel configuration which can 
enable Xen - not limit the configuration of a kernel because Xen has 
been enabled.  This is because  with paravirt-ops, Xen compiled kernels 
may not actually run on Xen, so you can't arbitrarily drop features 
because you assume Xen is there.
One of these has an easy solution - doublefault.  You don't need to 
install the doublefault gate if you don't want it, and the hypervisor 
doesn't need to freak out if you install it, it can just ignore the gate 
entirely and claim #DF is not supported.
