No I just want to bring this in in stages for easier review.

Its a reorganization of the code in order to get this in.

There are a couple of things that need to build on top of page migration. 
One is hotplug and the other is the remapping of bad memory. Both are

We plan to get the remapping functionality in as soon as possible. For 
that we also need to be able to move pages of all sorts.
