A better name for this would be "label", matching what's
passed from gpio_request().  Ndls abrviatns r bd.
Note that this means (on typical 32-bit embedded hardware)
twelve bytes per GPIO, which if you assume 256 GPIOs means
an extra 3 KB static memory compared to the patch I sent.

Simpler to pass a gpio_desc pointer ...

Leave the printk in ... this is the sort of thing we want
to see fixed, which becomes unlikely once you hide such
diagnostics.  And for that matter, what would be enabling
the "-DDEBUG" that would trigger a pr_debug() message?
... overall the main downside of these patches seems to
be that it consumes more static memory.
