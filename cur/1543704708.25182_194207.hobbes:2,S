The patch has never been posted seperately. It is part of a patch set for 
autofs4, to support the autofs 4.1.0+ daemon, that I sent to Andrew 
Morton. I was hoping that Jeremy would review them and they would make 
their way to Al but perhaps neither has had time to follow up.
I must add that Mike has pointed out that the vfsmount_lock, used by the 
patch is not exported and the patch does not change that.
