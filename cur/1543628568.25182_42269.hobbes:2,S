Hi,
You are mistaking the concept of filesystem and a block device type. You
are trying to use the ramdisk block devices but are talking about
filesystems.
As for the reason why you couldn't use the ramdisk (/dev/ram* devices) it
is due to missing support for them in your kernel configuration:

enable CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM and /dev/ram* will become useable. If you also
use initrd then enable CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD as well.
