Subject: What is codaauth? Why is Linux polling it?

I have a RH System at home, no mods, right out of the box.
It keeps sending UDP packets to 63.240.115.23.codaauth, so fast
it's killing my PPP bandwidth.
Anybody know how to shut it up? There is no coda file-system on
that machine (that I know of).
Cheers,
