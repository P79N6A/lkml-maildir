Subject: Wine doesn't work either (Re: New LDT handling in 2.3.x)

	This isn't quite the same thing, but in the past wine used to stop
working whenever LDT handling was modified until the wine folks sent in
a patch to fix some bugs that were not exposed much otherwise. 
Currently, wine (8/28/99) gives me errors like this on 2.3.15, though
I'm not sure this is a 2.3 problem because I don't have any 2.2 kernels
here to test:
Unhandled exception: page fault on read access to 0x413200a0 in 32-bit
code
Unhandled exception: priviledged instruction in 32-bit code
Any ideas?
