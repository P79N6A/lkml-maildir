Heinz Diehl reported this exact problem.  In my work tree, it isn't a
problem.  (I _hate_ it when I don't have the same problems as other
folks ;-)  Obviously, this tree is heavily patched, but nothing that
should be able to make this difference, and nothing that isn't very
heavily tested.

I just noticed that the kernel I'm running (with add-ons) is missing
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 (oops).  Maybe it's worth a shot to drop
that flag and see if it makes a difference? (thinking alignment woes)
