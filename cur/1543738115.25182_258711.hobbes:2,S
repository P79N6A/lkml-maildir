We would spend the time or remove the code. OpenServer??? Gag?? Puke??
According to Carl "Mad Dog" McBride Linux is already his "product" (What a
joke). OpenServer is not Linux.
If I receive a confirmation from A) Linus or B) Alan then we will profer
a license agreement for everyone to review and sign off on via PGP 
secure email.
We will worry about who is no longer available. We need the core folks 
whose names
appear as the original author in the master header of each file to sign 
off. They will need to
certify which files are theirs and send a confirmation.
This can be done, and if there is a process in place, others can come 
and give money as well.
It's time ALL YOU GUYS got rewarded for your hard work, and not just 
those who
positioned themselves to get fat stock options and IPO preffered stock 
for .com stock market
Google style IPO scams. It can happen.
