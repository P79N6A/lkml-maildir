Subject: [2.6.0-test9] Strange SCSI messages

I see these two errors (issued at the same time) in the kernel log file:
| Info fld=0x440b6b, Current sdsdd: sense key Recovered Error
| Additional sense: Address mark not found for data field
According to the sources, these are SCSI messages (matbe this should be
noted in the message?) -- but what do they mean?
