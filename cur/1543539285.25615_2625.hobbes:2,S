I thought that the point of RT sched. was that in a soft real time 
environment, given an expected amount of faults and a certain sys.
load you can expect a certain failure rate, and in a hard real time
environment given an expected number of faults and a sys. load you
can guarantee that if you add another task to the current set of tasks
it will (under most circumstances) succeed. If the granularity of the 
time used to set deadlines isn't precise enough for you to achieve a 
task (as per your example) that's one thing, but I thought that RT
scheduling 
is about deadlines and whether or not they can be met, which has nothing
to 
do with fast computing.
