Actualy the new virtual master is 100% as default.  The problem is
that the (old) alsactl is so strict (unless -F option is given) and
won't accept any changed values.  This is so even only when the mixer
element number id is changed although other attributes remain
identical.  Thus one addition may cause a chain reaction over all
elements.  IOW, it's rather a design problem of alsactl and a wrong
use in scripts than a kernel regression.
I already fixed this behavior in the latest version of alsactl to be
more robust.  But that version isn't used widely yet, unfortunately.

The controller chip doesn't indicate the root cause but it's rather in
the codec.  Please show the contents of /proc/asound/card0/codec*
files and the generated file via "alsactl -f somefile store", together
with PCI SSID (lspci -nv output).
