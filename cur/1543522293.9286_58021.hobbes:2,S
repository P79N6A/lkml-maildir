	Okay, you tell me what you prefer. How about "deliberately misrepresenting
in order to deliberately induce third parties into unintended actions that
harm other third parties."

	I just looked through the using ORBS files, and their examples don't seem
to show me any way to make use of this labelling. In fact, the examples tend
to include messages like "mail refused because it is an open relay". More
deliberate misrepresentation.

	I would still not use ORBS. To let someone else tell you who to blacklist
requires that you trust them. All trust in ORBS is long gone.

	Only if the management was honest about their past mistakes and explained
the principle behind why they were wrong. Otherwise, there is nothing
stopping them from doing it again. I don't trust people who don't screw me
out of happenstance. I trust people who don't screw me out of principle.

	The FAQ states that ORBS policy is "be probed or be list", but I see no
indication that this is in fact ORBS policy. I'm not sure if Rahul Dhesi is
in a position to make policy for ORBS, but it seems to me that it's simply a
deniable excuse. If it works, ORBS is excused. If it fails, its content can
be denied with words like, "Well, that's what Mr. Dhesi thinks about ORBS,
but actually it's this way, ..."
	That's really not conduct I consider reputable. Mr Dhesi's motives may be
admirable, but an explanation from an outside isn't good enough. A stand has
to be taken by ORBS, so we know why they act the way they do.
