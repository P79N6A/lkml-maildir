The default PAGE_OFFSET is at 0x7800000 for the 2G/2G split.
All of these options were originally !X86_PAE, I assume
the intention was to be able to have 2G of RAM without
needing high memory.
I don't really care I just saw the problem and decided to prevent
people trying a combination that simply doesn't work.
