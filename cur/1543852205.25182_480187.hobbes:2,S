The problem there is that on platforms with a 64-bit ino_t, this will be
too large to fit in a 32-bit field and we'll end up with the same
EOVERFLOW problem. Is there a more correct way to make it size
appropriately given the different possible sizes of s_lastino?
I suppose we could just set it to 0xffffffff and hope that that is "big
enough" for most cases.
