To put each lock in its own cacheline:
 static inline unsigned rmap_lockno(pgoff_t index)
 {
- 	return (index >> 4) & (ARRAY_SIZE(rmap_locks) - 1);
+ 	return (index >> 4) & (ARRAY_SIZE(rmap_locks) - 64);
 }
a quick hack, notable mainly for being obscure ;-)
I did try this and noticed scarcely any difference.
