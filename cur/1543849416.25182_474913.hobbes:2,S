It's very much architecture specific. I suppose x86 must have some HW
requirements of checking if the PTE is still present atomically when
setting the dirty bit but I can't tell for sure :)
On PowerPC, we don't use HW dirty bits, we use SW for that, thus the
ptep_get_and_clear will be enough to prevent any further dirty bit to be
set.
