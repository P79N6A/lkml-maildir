Hi,
Can someone give me some pointers on how to get control
over /dev/audio by two different applications?
I realized that it's not possible to open /dev/audio
in two separate applications while trying to setup
speakfreely...
If the device is full-duplex how can I have one application
reading it and another writing?
Thanks in advance
