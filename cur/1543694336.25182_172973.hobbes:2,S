I suppose you're asking why having a /dev/frandom device at all. Why not 
let everyone write their own little random generator (based upon 
well-known C functions) whenever random data is needed.
There are plenty of handy things in the kernel, that could be done in 
userspace. /dev/zero is my favourite example, but I'm sure there are 
other cases where things were put in the kernel simply because people 
found them handy. Which is a good reason, if you ask me.
Besides, it's quite easy to do something wrong with random numbers. By 
having a good source of random data, I suppose we can spare a lot of 
people the headache of getting their own user-space application right 
for the one-off thing they want to do.
But it's really a matter of taste. That's why I bring up the subject here.
