Ok, so, can I conclude that you are therefore saying that ext3 (with 
default mount options) is compliant with SPEC SFS Run rules wrt NFS 
protocol requirements:
   1.   For NFS Version 2, the server adheres to the protocol 
specification and in particular the requirement that for NFS write 
operations the NFS server must not reply to the NFS client before any 
modified file system data or metadata, with the exception of access times, 
are written to stable storage.
   2. For NFS Version 3, the server adheres to the protocol specification. 
In particular the requirement that for STABLE write requests and COMMIT 
operations the NFS server must not reply to the NFS client before any 
modified file system data or metadata, with the exception of access times, 
are written to stable storage for that specific or related operation. See 
RFC 1813, NFSv3 protocol specification for a definition of STABLE and 
COMMIT for NFS write requests.
   3. For NFS Version 3, operations which are specified to return wcc data 
must, in all cases, return TRUE and the correct attribute data. Those 
operations are:
      NFS Version 3
      SETATTR
      READLINK
      CREATE
      MKDIR
      SYMLINK
      MKNOD
      REMOVE
      RMDIR
      RENAME
      LINK
   4. The server must pass the benchmark validation for the NFS protocol 
being tested.
   5. When UDP is the network transport, UDP checksums must be calculated 
and verified for all NFS request and reply messages. In other words, 
checksums must be enabled on both the client and server.
Kind regards
Tigran
