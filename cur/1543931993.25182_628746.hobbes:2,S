It probably comes down to which version is bigger (you probably also 
want to try uninlining.)

Okay, so there is something inside ACPI which tickles this.  Which 
brings further credibility that it's activating a debugging hack, 
probably inside the SuperIO/system controller chip.
It would be interesting to know exactly which part of ACPI triggers 
this.  I bet it is a reference to system controller namespace.
