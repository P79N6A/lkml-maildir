phy_location corresponds to the printed labels on the box,
and is also shared with the various management consoles
and serivce processors and what not that get involved 
with stuff like that.
Although, please note: on these sysmes, 99% of the "useful"
info about hardware is in /proc/device-tree, and not in /sys
I doubt anyone looks at /sys/bus/pci/slots, I think they mostly
look at the open firmware device tree.
