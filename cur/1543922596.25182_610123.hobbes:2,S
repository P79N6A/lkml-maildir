Yes, but:
It is really impossible to register them just like that.
I only tried on one machine I implemented on, Jean tested with more
machines. Even there the resources did not only interfere, but overlap.
The Operation Region declarations in ACPI don't belong to a real driver,
but may be used in all kind of functions.
E.g. the thermal driver can't know which operation regions it may use
later, e.g. by invoking _THM which in turn invokes a couple of other
functions where IO ports are addressed via operation regions.
Also the BIOS developers seem to choose the regions in a very dump way
sometimes.
Just some imaginary values, but I saw similar (overlapping):
 - For a PNP device IO ports from 0x400-0x410 are reserved
 - A operation region is declared from 0x399-0x401
My first approach was to register the regions via request_resource and
failed on the first machine.
I then thought about acpi exporting it's own request/check_acpi_region
and add it into request_region..., but this also did not work out.
IMO this is the only way, at least for getting an overview how regions
are used and where we might need an ACPI driver and have interference as
a first step. There might be more steps we could take in future, maybe
someone gets a better idea, but as said, there are no rules how BIOS
developers make use of those regions.
Also the current request_resource interface (not the interface but the
callers), need to be polished up first.
1) E.g. PNPACPI needs to dynamically allocate its resources (as we
already discussed, I hope to be able to send something soon. Already
works, but this will also affect PNPBIOS and ISAPNP, a lot old code and
this needs careful review/testing).
2) I have no idea why e.g. i386/x86_64 kernel/setup.c code statically
requests some ports below 0x100 and whether it can be ripped out or gets
requested via the operation regions then in a sane way. I know they
interfere on some systems with operation regions.
It's just too much to solve in one step, if it can be resolved at all.
