What's the current status of HPT 374 support? Is it working in any kernel
version?
I know HP provides binaries, but that's no good, I need to use other kernel
builds.
2.4.20-8 detects the card and provides the devices but data corruptions
happens all the time. Using the HP drivers everything works fine (note that
access is via /dev/sd* instead of /dev/hd*)...except that I can't replace
the kernel.
Thanks.
