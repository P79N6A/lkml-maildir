I have before but I only got a blank screen. I just tried it with the latest 
patch and it does work and doesn't exhibit the problem but has a couple of
drawbacks. The ACPI information and the start comes up distorted probably 
because the framebuffer is getting initialized. I either get characters a 
mile apart. (i.e. i         n                      f                       o) 
and I just got some colored confetti instead of (ACPI) information. 
That's not really my biggest problem because that would be the fact that my 
tv-out isn't working. Looks like it's out of sync. The documentation on how 
to control the framebuffer seems to be lacking somewhat. I don't no if the 
ati-setup which was reintroduced could help me there? (I couldn't find it by 
the way) The append="video=radeonfb:1024x768-24@85" doesn't seem to work
for me in the lilo config (I also tried radeon instead of radeonfb). I only 
get a reolution 640x480 screen @60hz. The vesa framebuffer seems to be able
to control the tv-out independent of the resolution of the monitor. I don't 
know if it's an issue with the radeonfb or that it just not featured?
Thanks,
