please don't do this.  You want to be using time_before() and
jiffies_to_msecs().  The space problems apply to the rest of the code

I really don't think this is a good indicator of your firmware
necessarily having problems; I really think you might want to look at
other indicators ... jiffies_at_alloc might be better, or even
throttling from the abort handler, which must have been called before
you get to here if the command is actually timing out.
Timeout and abort has it's own throttle anyway, since we quiesce the
host before beginning error recovery ... are you sure this scheme
actually solves anything for your device?
