Maybe I'm just wrong... I definitely chosen bad example (grub) because
it is also bootloader...

Kernel does not know what is exacutable and what is data. Thanks to
buffer overflows, the line between executable and data is extremely
blury.
Now, to my argumentation. Imagine bootscripts containing
"show_etc_issue" command. (That shows /etc/issue). If there's buffer
overflow in "show_etc_issue" command, it is *not* security issue as of
now, because it only works on data provided by root. But it becomes
issue when IMA system is in use, because now /etc/issue can be used to
inject code into system; something that was not possible before.
OTOH buffer overrun in show_etc_issue is certainly bad thing, because
it is unexpected behaviour; and if IMA means such stuff is fixed...
It just seems like a lot of work. You are basically adding check at
every place where user can
shoot_himself_in_the_foot^W^W^W^W^Wdo_something_stupid_to_system_security
. I suspect many config files can be used to compromise system
security...
