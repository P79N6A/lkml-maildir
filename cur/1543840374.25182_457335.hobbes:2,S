there's nothing sane that can be done in that case; any wake up already will cause the unwanted latency!
A premature wakeup is only making it happen *now*, but now is as inconvenient a time as any...
(in fact it may be a worst case time scenario, say, an audio interrupt...)

printk'ing would be evil, changes like this will be "semi frequent", like every time you start
or stop playing audio. What ACPI could easily do is indicate in /proc/acpi/processor/*/power
that a state will not be reachable because it violates the latency constraints. That would
be entirely reasonable.

While it's valuable info.. there is nothing you can DO about it...
While the kernel can even do a latency of 1us by just not going into C1 even... so the kernel
CAN honor it, even if it thinks it might not be a good idea. Can you give a more concrete example
of a situation where you think your idea would be useful?
