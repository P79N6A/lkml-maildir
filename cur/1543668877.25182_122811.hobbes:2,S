Subject: Linux 2.4.21-pre7 HPT372N is missing its PCI ID

Hello,
while compiling 2.4.21-pre7 i noticed that there are problems with
compiling support for HPT372N.
I think that we need a PCI_ID for it in include/linux/pci_ids.h, like
diff -Nru linux-2.4.20.orig/include/linux/pci_ids.h linux-2.4.20/include/linux/pci_ids.h

I do not now the real PCI ID of HPT372N, so it would have to be checked.
With the patch above it compiles but i can not say if it is the correct
id.
