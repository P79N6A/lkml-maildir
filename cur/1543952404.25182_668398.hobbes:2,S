heh, I don't even have to...
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   54 MB in  3.03 seconds =  17.83 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# setpci -s 00:09.2 4b.b=29
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   78 MB in  3.06 seconds =  25.53 MB/sec
Well, that does look much better. Not on par with the non-EHCI case,
 but way better ! Thanks a lot !
Of course if you wish me to run anything else, just say so :)
