It's absolutely true. You will get emails like 
this very soon.
Quickly, send me an email and you will
get real com.miss.ion emails with this 
subject line and a big, big comm_ission
pa.yments from all the bus_inesses you
pro_mote. 
To pro.ve it, for a limit/ed per_iod I will
give.you 10 sign_ups (that will p.a.y. to
j.o.i.n. your bus.in.ess) and I will not ask
you for a sin.gle cent/penny to get you 
star-ted. Use these to gen_erate an
in.stant in.com_e.
Only the first 10 replies get 10 paid_
signups.
Then sitback & watch the_sign_ups
join_you inst_antly in their droves and
without you having to do much_at all.
At the end of March you will get
comm_ission state_ments showing that
you have ear.ned tens_of thou_s_ands
of doll_ars from your existing bus..iness.
oppo.rtun.it.ies. 
Miss. this and def_in.it.ely missout on 
the ea-sie.st and fas.test mo.ney that
you will ever ma.ke from your bu.sin_ess
opp.or-tuni.ty
Email me on earnbigmoney@tiscali.co.uk
please put "yes" in the subject line.
Good Luck
Gavin
