Jens,
You win -- it is not worth trying to work with you at this time.
All you and I have done is become bitter enemies.
Next, I do not know all the details of the kernel, but what I know is
that neither one of us is willing to listen and learn.  However, I have
tried to get answers from you public and private, and nothing.  You may
get your wish granted to replace me in the future, as this has been your
stated goal from the past to me directly.
In closing, there were several cases of filesystem corruption based on
partition offsets and other various items.  This was totally unacceptable
for the most part.  I truly think that you do not see what the object of
"BLOCK" is all about, regardless that you are clever and quick.  You have
decided that block will define the interface to the drivers and thus the
drivers can not conform to standards set forth by the people creating the
physical layer.
Finally, I offer a public apology to you and all who have suffered on LKML.
Respectfully,
Andre Hedrick
