Bizarre.
You think you've caught me indulging in silent semantic changes?

It's alarming, but I don't recognize the bells.
I blame the removal of SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN, that I copied from you ;)
Seriously, it's fine for me on i386, has been in -mm for ten days,
and I don't see what's architecture dependent about the changes.
Nothing springs to my mind: may I ask you (or any others who find the
same?) to delve into it?  If I have any ideas later on, I'll mail again.
Thanks - and sorry for this late and unhelpful response,
Hugh
