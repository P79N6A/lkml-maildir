What do those numbers refer to?  Card model numbers?  On ITE's site I can only 
see an IT8212F which has RAID and an IT8211F that doesn't.
I got my IT8212F card from Novatech.  A generic card with no obviously 
recognisable name and, IMO anyway, quite a reasonable price.  That is 
assuming it really does everything that they say it can.

It certainly works quite well in pass through mode. *8)
