No. I set all sockets, even the original listen() socket to
TCP_NODELAY. Nothing makes any difference. I tried it on a
600+ MHz machine with and a 133 MHz machine with no aparent
difference in the turn-around time. Of course the 600 MHz
machine sends large buffers of data faster:
   With a 64k buffer:
   600 MHz  133MHz RAM  ~ 9.98 Megabytes/second.
   133 MHz  100MHz RAM  ~ 6.50 Megabytes/second.
   With a 4 k buffer:
   600 MHz  133MHz RAM  ~ 5.15 Megabytes/second.
   133 MHz  100MHz RAM  ~ 3.30 Megabytes/second.
   With 64 bytes:
   600 MHz  133MHz RAM  ~ 1.2 kilobytes/second.
   133 MHz  100MHz RAM  ~ 1.1 kilobytes/second.
   Time from transmission to reception of a small buffer
   from the simplist echo server (read, write, no select):
   600 MHz  133MHz RAM  ~ 0.9 millisecond.
   133 MHz  100MHz RAM  ~ 1.0 millisecond.
   This is with two eepro100 network boards and two
   pairs of machines.
   The turn-around time for small buffers is about
   1 millisecond for both.
   `ping` shows low microseconds in all cases.
   The problem was discovered on an embedded system at
   a customer site so I set up two pairs of machines to
   see what performance is possible. I though first that
   there was a half/full/duplex problem or a hub problem.
   These two pair are connected with a X-over cable, no
   hubs.
Cheers,

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
