Probably better documentation in exports.5 would be just as useful.
And "BUSY" probably isn't correct ....
The rule is that you cannot export a directory and an ancestor of that
directory in the same filesystem.
/a/1 and /a/2 can both be exported, but not /a and /a/1.
Reason:  exporting "/a" means exporting that directoring and all
descendants of it in the same filesystem.
If you export /a with different flags than /a/1 it is ambiguous.
And personally, I doubt that there are very many situations where it
makes sense.
It would be possible to dis-ambiguate the ambiguity but it wouldn't be
very clean, and I really am not sure that it is worth the effort.
