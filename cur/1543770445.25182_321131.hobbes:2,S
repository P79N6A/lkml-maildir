how would you do that, if even a first step (PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY) was 
opposed by some as possibly hurting throughput? I'm really curious, what 
would you do to improve PREEMPT_NONE's latencies?

what i meant is a pretty common-sense thing: the more independent the
locks are, the more shortlived locking is, the less latencies there are.
The reverse is true too: most of the latency-breakers move code out from
under locks - which obviously improves scalability too. So if you are 
working on scalability you'll indirectly improve latencies - and if you 
are working on reducing latencies, you often improve scalability.

for good sound you'll at least need PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY. You'll need 
CONFIG_PREEMPT for certain workloads or pro-audio use.

the impact of PREEMPT on the codebase has a positive effect as well: it 
forces us to document SMP data structure dependencies better. Under 
PREEMPT_NONE it would have been way too easy to get into the kind of 
undocumented interdependent data structure business that we so well know 
from the big kernel lock days. get_cpu()/put_cpu() precisely marks the 
critical section where we use a given per-CPU data structure.
