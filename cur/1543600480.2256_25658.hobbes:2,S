I did not know other Unices were (in general) preemptible.  Solaris is?
The only one I thought was preemptible was Irix.
Anyhow, you are right about the simplistic approach we take.  There are
a few alternatives: mixing mutexes and shorter locks, priority-bearing
semaphores, changing the way the preemption count works, etc.

What different conclusion? What are you even arguing with me about? 
Do you think I am against a preemptible kernel?  I _posted_ the damn
patch, of course I am not.
I probably agree with whatever you are thinking.
