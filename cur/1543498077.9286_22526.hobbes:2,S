Hi John,
I've been watching the Linux community's progress in 
fixing the performance problems found by Mindcraft,
and covering that progress in my page 
http://www.kegel.com/mindcraft_redux.html
If you haven't seen it yet, do take a look; I think it's
a good resource for benchmarkers.
Is there any info online about the schedule for and 
participants in the June 14th Apache/Linux benchmark
you're hosting for Mindcraft
(
http://www.mindcraft.com/openbenchmark.html
)?  
If so, I'd like to link to it.
Also, Juergen Schmidt's recent tests for c't magazin were
rendered partially invalid because he neglected to
configure Apache to block in accept() as required for
maximal Linux performance.  He was informed by several 
people of the error as soon as he posted his config 
files, but by then it was too late.
I'd like to prevent similar problems in the upcoming tests.  
Perhaps a mailing list should be set up for posting and 
discussing proposed configuration files before the test.
That way, remote participants can eyeball them for trouble,
and suggest improvements.
The publication embargo, by the way, might get in the way
of getting the best possible results.  Perhaps it could
be modified to allow posting of intermediate results 
as long as they did not mention absolute performance numbers
or comparisons with other servers; enough benefit would
come from posts of the sort "Performance levels off at
80 clients" or "SMP performance is no better than uniprocessor
performance".
It would add a little openness, too, to have the
folks representing the Linux side introduce themselves
to the mailing list ahead of time.  As it is, 
there's still a bit of mystery about the tests.
Cheers,
Dan Kegel
