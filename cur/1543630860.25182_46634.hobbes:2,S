You'll want to take a look at the LinuxSH project, located at
http://www.sf.net/projects/linuxsh
 (CVS head against 2.5, linux-2_4-branch for
2.4).
You'll probably also want to subscribe to the linuxsh-dev mailing list, since
that's more of an appropriate venue for this kind of thing than l-k is.
As for the SH7729, that's just another SH-3 DSP. It's supported in CVS
already. If you have a custom board using it, the Harp board is another one
that uses it as well, which should give you a decent starting point for
bringing it up on your hardware.
