Well, there's still the
	if (err)
		__ext3_std_error(inode->i_sb, where, err);
case in ext3_journal_stop() to worry about, so we still need it; and I'd
much rather not hack this via j_private, when what we're doing at this
point is most definitely a fs-specific, not journal-related, operation.

Agreed.

I was wondering why we've never seen this on 2.4, even with slab
poisoning enabled.  But I think the vulnerability exists on 2.4 too, so
yes, we ought to keep the two in sync.

Well, the intent of the s_dirt was to force a call to ext3_write_super
when the fs was dirty, back before the days when we had a sync_fs()
method at all.  Now that we have the latter, it sounds like we should
actually just drop the line which sets s_dirt in ext3_journal_stop
entirely, because sync will always call the new sync_fs which will do
the commit that we need.
We still have the error handling path in ext3_journal_stop so we can't
avoid having to find the sb, so _some_ rejigging is still needed.
Cheers,
 Stephen
