Hi!
Motherboard is:
http://www.intel.com/design/servers/SE7505VB2/index.htm?iid=ipp_srvr
+mthrbds_se7505VB2_srvr&
Controller is sii3112a
I activated the trick with max_kb_per_request
Kernel 2.4.21 doesn't enable UDMA on the channels.
If I enable DMA (hdparm) the computer ALMOST freeze.
I can switch the consoles but with a 5 sec delay.
But, seems that the bus freeze. No activity even after 2 minutes.
I had to reboot.
Any ideas?
Thanks!
