I love this patch. My only concern is about worst-case space consumption,
but it is beautiful regardless, and space consumption can be addressed
later if it is a problem in practice. The average case space consumption,
as you have noted, is quite good already, and it seems difficult to
trigger the worst case (I have tested it myself).
Cheers,
