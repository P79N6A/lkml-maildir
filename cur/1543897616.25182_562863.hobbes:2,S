An perhaps you are right. I don't have a very strong opinion on that.
Still I can't understand why it is better if kthread_stop() sends a
signal as well. Contrary, I believe we should avoid signals when it
comes to kernel threads.
One can always use force_sig() or allow_signal() + send_sig() when
it is really needed, like cifs does.

Yes, kthread_stop(k) means that k should exit eventually, but I don't
think that kthread_stop() should try to force the exit.

timeout, but this was just a silly example. I am talking about the case
when wait_event_interruptible() should not fail (unless something bad
happens) inside the "while (!kthread_should_stop())" loop.
Note also that kthread could use TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE sleep because it
doesn't want to contribute to loadavg, and because it knows that all
signals are ignored.

Yes sure, we can't kill the kernel thread via signal. I meant we can have
some unexpected failure.

I think this "if(tsk)" is just bogus, and should be killed.
