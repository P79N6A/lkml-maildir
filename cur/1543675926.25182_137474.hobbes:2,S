My brother and I wrote a driver for em8400 supporting the Linux DVB
API when we were at convergence (www.convergence.de), but they haven`t
released it. There was a short discussion about it on the linux-dvb
mailing list (see archives at www.linuxtv.org), but it looks like it
is not clear who they have to ask and what they have to do to release it.
