Subject: missing TLB flushes (2.3.13-2)

Hi Linus,
on Friday, I sent you a mail with 2 possibly missing TLB flushes.
You fixed one of them in 2.3.13-1, but the other one is not fixed
(in 2.3.13-2).
Please send me a note if this is not a bug, so that I can stop
reposting this.
Problem:
on crossing TLB flushes, mm->cpu_vm_mask is not updated.
Fix:
add the code from smp_invalidate_interrupt() to flush_tlb_others()
Patch vs 2.3.13-2:

Description:
both flush_tlb_current() and flush_tlb_mm() rely on
mm->cpu_vm_mask to check which CPUs need a smp_invalidate_interrupt()
IPI. This flag is cleared by flush_tlb_??() and then set in
smp_invalidate_interrupt() if there is really a VM user on that CPU.
But this IPI could also be acknowledged by flush_tlb_others() if 2 
CPUs execute a TLB flush at the same time, and in this
case the update of mm->cpu_vm_mask is missing.
