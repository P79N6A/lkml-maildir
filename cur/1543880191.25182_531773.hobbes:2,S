Huh. Quite strange as its the same acpi_pm clocksource driver!
The only difference I see right off is that verify_pmtmr_rate() isn't
done on x86_64. Although I'd expect you'd see "PM-Timer running at
invalid rate" w/ the i386 kernel if it made a difference.
Could you send me the dmesg output for both the x86_64 and i386 kernels
you tried?
thanks
