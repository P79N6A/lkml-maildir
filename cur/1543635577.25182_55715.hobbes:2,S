But that's crude and awkward.  Rmmod just needs deregister_filesystem in its
call chain and we're in great shape, without that fragile chain of
assumptions.

I believe the remaining race is rmmod-ret.  But it's not just a matter of
papering that over, the goal here is to get the thing into simplest form,
with an easily documentable interface that can be applied to the rest, or
almost all the rest of the module flavors.
I now have little doubt that even the complex module cases like (when it
happens) modular networking can be fit into the new module.  It comes
down to a pretty simple concept: you have a slow path *in the module*
that locks/unlocks the module in memory and knows the gory details of
active users, including spawned threads.  The fast paths don't have to
do any bookkeeping themselves.
Erm, by the way, there's the nasty detail of IO completion code in a
module.  This brings back the rmmod-ret race in a new incarnation;
even if the module's code keeps track of all submissions and
completions, there's no easy way to ensure the IO completion code
called from interrupt or soft irq context has returned to its caller.
I think the answer here is "just don't do it" - use the existing IO
completion handlers, and if they aren't good enough for some reason,
then we need a new, generic IO completion flavor that knows how to do
the required bookkeeping when it invokes the one in our module.
Bleh.

Let unregister be able to fail, why work around the borkness?  We
just need to be able to say -EBUSY to rmmod->remove so rmmod can duly
report that to the user.

The module interface is under the knife, that's the whole point of
this.  Fortunately, what needs to be done is pretty minor.
