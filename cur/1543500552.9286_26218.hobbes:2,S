They're actually physical addresses that you need to call ioremap() on in
order to get a kernel mapping to access them.  Ioremap takes the address
and size (see Documentation/IO-mapping.txt for more details).  Note that
since they're coming directly from the PCI base, you'll have to mask off
the low four bits as those are flags (prefetchable and io space are the
two I remember off the top of my head).  One other item to consider is
that PCI address ranges are allocated based on their size, so if you have
a memory range that's less than PAGE_SIZE, you can't pass it on to ioremap
without fiddling first. =)
