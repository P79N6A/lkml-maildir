Should be the "dump" attribute

It's the file type. Redundant.

Should be reflected by the write bits. (Maybe there should be an option to
set the file mode for "read only" files to something different than
$rw_mode and not 0222.)

Should be made "immutable", IMO

The volume bit of a file will never be set, since no file is a volume name.
Setting a volume attribute should be disallowed, too, since it would cause
fs corruption. This leaves us with no need to know or set 'v'.
You should rather make the volume name be similar to the e2fs volume label.
