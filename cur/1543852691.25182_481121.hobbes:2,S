We find this out by black listing them. I got that working reliably as far as I know.
The main cases I know where we can't use it right now is:
- AMD >1 core
* when clock ramping is disabled it gets a little better, but on multi socket
it is still broken
* also it varies in frequency here which has to be handled
+ There is a little issue here that the frequency takes some unpredictible 
time to stabilize after the frequency change. AFAIK the error is too small
to cause problems though.
- Some Intel NUMA systems (IBM x4xx, Unisys ES7000, ScaleMP) 
* handled by detecting multiple Apic Clusters
- Intel systems with C3
* stops in C3. disable here
- a few P4 dual cores seem to lose TSC synchronization when overclocked
(or most likely overvolted) and running out of Spec
* I chose to ignore this case. User fault. They can set command line options.
- We had one Intel BIOS which misprogrammed the FSB dividers
* Got fixed by BIOS update. Also it was a obscure case that can be handled
with command line options.
I don't see how this is changing much with dyntimers. The only
difference that should be there is that you require TSC stability for
a longer time (instead of only HZ), but normally when the TSC is instable
it already causes trouble in the current setup.
You're probably overreacting to something. Maybe one of the old bugs?
(I had a typo in the Intel C3 detection for a long time that broke
a lot of Intel laptops)

Not true.

Intel already has that (modulo totally broken BIOS and overclocking). 
TSC is running always at highest P-state and usually synchronized too.
AMD is getting there.

That's unrealistic unfortunately any time soon.  All the CPU vendors
are pushing for much more aggressive power saving and this basically 
means turning off the CPU completely in the deeper sleep states.
