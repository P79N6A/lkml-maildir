What? You are using log10 only twice!
        if (!(siu_obj_status & ST_OPEN)) {
		...
                /* = log2(over) */
                ydef[22] = (u_int32_t)(log10((double)(over & 0x0000003f)) /
                                       log10(2));
		...
        }
        else {
		...
                if (coef) {
                        ydef[16] = 0x03045000 | (over << 26) | (tap - 4);
                        ydef[17] = (tap * 2 + 1);
                        /* = log2(over) */
                        ydef[22] = (u_int32_t)
                                (log10((double)(over & 0x0000003f)) / log10(2));
                }
Don't you think that log10((double)(over & 0x0000003f)) / log10(2)
can have only 64 different values depending on the result of (over & 0x3f)?
Obtain them from precomputed uint32_t log10table[64].
