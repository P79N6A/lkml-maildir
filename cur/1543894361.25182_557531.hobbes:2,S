i'm pleased to announce release -v17 of the CFS scheduler patchset.
The rolled-up CFS patch against v2.6.22-rc4, v2.6.22-rc4-mm2, v2.6.21.5 
or v2.6.20.13 can be downloaded from the usual place:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/
-v17 includes a bigger change: the CFS-core changes in preparation of 
the group-scheduling feature, written Srivatsa Vaddagiri. Dmitry 
Adamushko provided cleanups and further generalizations to this code and 
the modularization of CFS has been further enhanced as a result. To 
users, these changes are mostly invisible.
Changes since -v16:
 - lots of core updates to support group scheduling, and related 
   cleanups. (Srivatsa Vaddagiri, Dmitry Adamushko)
 - tuned the runtime-limit up a bit, based on relentless testing done by
   Tobias Gerschner.
 - the new, precise load-calculation method for SMP balancing has been
   further enhanced, and is now active by default. (Dmitry Adamushko)
 - fix SCHED_IDLEPRIO support (based on feedback from Thomas Sattler)
 - further updates to /proc/sched_debug and /proc/PID/sched
 - more cleanups
As usual, any sort of feedback, bugreport, fix and suggestion is more 
than welcome!
