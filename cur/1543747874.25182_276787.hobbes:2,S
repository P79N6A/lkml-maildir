Martin Pool changed the behaviour of the BLKRRPART ioctl in 2.6.8.
The effect is that one now gets an I/O error when first
partitioning an empty disk:
# sfdisk /dev/sda
Checking that no-one is using this disk right now ...
BLKRRPART: Input/output error
Ugly. I am tempted to go back to the state before his patch.
Why was this patch made? Just something random that seemed like
a good idea? Is there software that needs it?

The guilty patch (called "lost error code"):
	if (!get_capacity(disk) || !(state = check_partition(disk, bdev)))
-          return 0;
+          return -EIO;
