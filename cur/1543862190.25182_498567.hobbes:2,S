Subject: [PATCH] Kdump documentation update for 2.6.20: ia64 portion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
this patch fills in the portions for ia64 kexec.
I'm actually not sure what options are required for the dump-capture
kernel, but "init 1 irqpoll maxcpus=1" has been working fine for me.
Or more to the point, I'm not sure if irqpoll is needed or not.
This patch requires the documentation patch update that Vivek Goyal has
been circulating, and I believe is currently in mm. Feel free to fold it
into that change if it makes things easier for anyone.
