since 2.3.16 (and with 3.17) I cannot mount my mitsumi 8x atapi drive correctly.
vfat is compiled as module and is loaded, but mount keep mounting it as iso9660.
when I try mount /dev/hdc /mnt/cdrom -tvfat it tells me wrong fs type or too
many...
sometimes when I umount it the kernel locks hard (alt print-screen doesn't
work).
if I do hdparm -d0 /dev/hdc and then hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc, the kernel locks hard
everytime.
Using Mandrake 6.0 on a dual PII-350 with a PC CHIPS M750 motherboard.
I had no problem with 2.3.15, and 2.2.12 (vanilla + andrea sched patch) works
well.
