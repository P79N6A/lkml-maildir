Oh, come on. How many applications do you know which are prepared to handle
the case that the file they were happily rooting around in suddenly isn't
anymore?

Disagree. It is the kernel's responsibility to give application consistency
as far as it can. That we can live with the cases where it doesn't work out
is only because (thankfully) they are rather rare.

I don't see the use. My processes will get killed (or much worse, will
screw up (badly, remember Murphy?)) when their files dissapear under
them. Sure, being able to kill(2) a process regardless of where it hung
would be nice. But is it really worth the cost?
