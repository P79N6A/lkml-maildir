	In fact, I have seen the same behaviour with elm ME+ and the
	new 2.2.0 pre7 and final kernel : upon resynchronisation of my
	folder, it disappears before beeing renamed, thus putting
	elm in a bad state.
	I am using procmail to redirect the mail messages into a
	folder located in my home directory. The NFS server is
	a Solaris 2.5.1. I had to recompile elm to make it work
	with the NFS locking mechanism of the new kernels.
	I tried to follow the operations performed by elm on a
	resynchronisation :
	[... some stuff where a "tmp mailbox" is created from the ....]
	[... original "mailbox" file (located in my home dir      ....]
	then :
	1)	fopen("mailbox")
	2)	unlink("mailbox")
	3)	ftruncate("mailbox")	: the mailbox file is still there
	4)	fread("tmp mailbox", buffer) && fwrite("mailbox", buffer)
			[ie. recopy tmp mailbox" in "mailbox"]
	Up to here, "mailbox" is still present
	5)	fflush("mailbox")
	6)	a few seconds later, "mailbox" disappears !
	7)	elm completely screwed up.
	The same version of elm ME+ has been compiled on every OS'es
	we are working with (Solaris, SunOS, Irix, HP-UX, FreeBSD,
	Linux 2.0.36, ...) and it works in that configuration.
