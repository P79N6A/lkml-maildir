Yeah, but doing:
	static inline foo(void);
	bar()
	{
		...
		foo();
	}
	static inline foo(void)
	{
		...
	}
is pretty dumb too.  I don't see any harm if this compiler feature/problem
pushes us to fix the above in the obvious way.
Plus if we do, the inlining attempt actually succeed, on all compiler
versions.
