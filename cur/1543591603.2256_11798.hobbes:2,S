Sure, you're right, but Al's point is that you shouldn't need to.
One of the fundamentals of Unix is that "everything is a file" and that
you can do everything by reading or writing that file. The devices are
the big exception, they need ioctls to control them. With Al's proposal
we can get rid of the ioctls and let the devices behave like normal
files.

 with similar conclusion: ioctls are bad, we should get rid of them]
