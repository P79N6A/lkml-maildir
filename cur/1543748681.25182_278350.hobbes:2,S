Subject: [PATCH] moxa: Update status of Moxa Smartio driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After contacting Moxa, I found out that they no longer maintain the in-kernel
driver, and instead maintain an updated driver as an external patch.
This patch updates the documentation to reflect this.

+***NOTE*** - The driver included in the kernel is not maintained by Moxa.  They
+have a version 1.8 driver available from:

+
http://www.moxa.com
+
+that works with 2.6 kernels.  Currently, Moxa has no plans to have their updated
+driver merged into the kernel.
