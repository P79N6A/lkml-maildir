Yeah I did, it's smaller actually:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  44898   17804     120   62822    f566 spufs-before.o
  44886   17804     120   62810    f55a spufs-after.o

Well that'd be nice, but I don't see anywhere that that happens. AFAICT
the acquire we do in the first coredump callback is the first the SPU
contexts know about their PPE process dying. And spufs is still live, so
I think we definitely need to grab the mutex, or we might race with
userspace accessing spufs files.
