For that particular screensaver, notice that glmatrix starts drawing nothing.
30 seconds after the start there're lots of polygons so after 20 seconds
it needs more processing power. It happens exactly the same
but the difference is not so big, from 30fps to 24fps, perhaps
you didn't enabled DRI acceleration?
