I have been involved in benchmarking and testing that stripped down and 
kernel-style version and cannot recall any mention of said alignment errors. 
Perhaps I was removed from the CC: list - could you point me at them?
At last glance the other version you mention has a marginally faster (1 to 
3%) "safe" decompressor. The only problems that Markus FXJ Oberhumer seems to 
have with that stripped down version is the renaming of the 
LZO1X_MEM_COMPRESS constant to LZO1X_WORKMEM_SIZE.  (only real complaint I 
can recall seeing).
If there *are* memory alignment issues, why not fix them in that tiny code 
rather than pushing a different version of the code into the kernel that is 
1) Not kernel style and 2) bloated?

I do agree that an implementation of LZO should go in the kernel so that the 
various users of the algorithm don't have to include their own copies of the 
code. However, the sheer bloatworthiness of this code is pitiful - perhaps 
it'd be best if you ditched the "diffability against userspace" in favor of 
having the code be non-bloated and kernel-style? (wait - that's what 
the "other" version you previously mentioned does)

Then submit the fix for the security hole as a seperate patch to the Rieser4 
people.

Unless you can clearly point out those "memory alignment" issues in the 
kernel-style code of the other LZO implementation that was posted as an RFC I 
have to say this: stop the FUD. 
Anyway... It may mean absolutely nothing but...
NACK
