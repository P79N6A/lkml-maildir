I have some rather funny problem:
On shutdown I do basically "kill -15 -1; kill -9 -1; swapoff -q ; umount -v -a -r"
Although this does not give any error messages the filesystems were not cleanly unmounted and fsck was run upon reboot.
I then used the MagicSysRQ Keys once the system was halted. Although there was no difference in the running tasks report (Alt-SysRQ-t) before and after doing SIGKILL (Alt-SysRQ-i) umount (Alt-SysRQ-u) only succeeded after sending SIGKILL.
Is this probably because my init and umount are dynamically linked?
any hints appreciated
Thomas
