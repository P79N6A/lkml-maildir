What as? I have both klogd and syslogd running on my system, and have
had a few oops on various occasions, but have NEVER seen anything in
/var/log/messages relating to them...

Even if both are running, it's quite possible the oops won't get
logged as things stand - certainly my impression from examining the
various log files is that they aren't logged, at least with 2.0.3[0-6]
as I've been running on various systems...
One thing I have noticed is that/etc/syslog.conf can be configured to
provide specific log files for specific types of kernel message, and
my thoughts in proposing the above was that if there was a separate
loglevel for OOPS reports, then the various distributors MIGHT be
persuaded to configure their default installations such that all OOPS
reports got logged to a separate logfile - perhaps /var/log/oops or
the like, thus easing the burden somewhat...

Perhaps appending a reference to it to the end of every OOPS report
might persuade them to at least see if the file exists on their
system. Many probably don't even know it's there...
Best wishes from Riley.
