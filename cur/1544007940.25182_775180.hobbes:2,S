Actually, it is a requirement that some drivers rely on. There is also
a WARN_ON(), or possibly a BUG_ON() in the request handling path. I
think it only triggers with MMC_DEBUG though...

That would be a no-no. I guess this is not properly documented, but it
is strongly implied that the request structure should be read-only
except for fields that contain result data. ;)

if-clauses look like they're different, but they're not.

Controllers do not follow the specs. Welcome to reality. :)
(sad fact: I don't think there is a single controller out there that
follows the specs to 100%).
Anyway, for this specific case, a controller might not be able to
differentiate between command and data timeouts. Or it might report
"data error" for anything unexpected (I seem to recall one of the
currently supported controllers behaves like this).
Generally it's about being as flexible as we can be. This is a world of
crappy hardware, so strict spec adherence just leads to a lot of hurt.
And I have the scars to prove it. :)

I didn't mean an error for the bad sector, but something like
"encountered an error during multi-block transfer. retrying...". This
could save a lot of time and headache during debugging in the future.

This could use a comment explaining that if we've reached this point,
we know that it was a single sector that failed.

Shouldn't this comment stay now? :)
