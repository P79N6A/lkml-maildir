Ingo,
was it intentional to remove the call to mach_reboot_fixups() during
the merge of reboot_{32,64}.c? If so, it seems odd that
reboot_fixups_32.c was left in the tree (and there was even stuff
added to it). But it would rather seem that those machines dealt with
in that file would not reboot properly anymore (for one of my boxes
I added an entry in that table to make it boot properly, which is why
I noticed the code not being called anymore)...
Thanks, Jan
