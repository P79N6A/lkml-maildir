Hello!
I'm sorry, but acpi=routeirq doesn't work. But to my head came other
thing. I noticed that I on 2.6.9 (which correct works) I have this
part of dmesg:
hdb: Host Protected Area detected.
	current capacity is 66055248 sectors (33820 MB)
	native  capacity is 78165360 sectors (40020 MB)
hdb: 66055248 sectors (33820 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=65531/16/63,
UDMA(33)
and on 2.6.10 I have:
hdb: Host Protected Area detected.
	current capacity is 66055248 sectors (33820 MB)
	native  capacity is 78165360 sectors (40020 MB)
hdb: Host Protected Area disabled.
hdb: 78165360 sectors (40020 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=65535/16/63,
UDMA(33)
How see, first is 32GB (33820 MB), and second is 40GB (40020MB).
Correct value should be 32GB, in spite that my disk is 40GB. I want
to say, that I have a little old BIOS and my BIOS detect only 32GB,
therefore I have limited size of my disk. And maybe kernel 2.6.10
influence on my BIOS and force to detect 40GB, which is not
operable, because my BIOS is too old. I think that maybe to fix it I
should force my kernel to detect only 32GB, how on kernel 2.6.9.
Maybe this is a BUG of new kernel?
Fryderyk.
