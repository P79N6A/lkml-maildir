Honestly, I don't remember. I think it was one of the very first 2.6
kernels because when MV first released a 2.6 product, 2.6 was still
'experimental'. It's quite possible of course that the driver was never
properly merged upstream in the community tree(s). But I do know that it
worked in the internal MV tree and an effort was made to get the driver
accepted upstream.
