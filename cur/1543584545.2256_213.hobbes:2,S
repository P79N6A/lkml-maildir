Hi, first of all, thanks for the reply!
How do you reconcile that statement with the following comment from mm.h?

Surely, if you have to multiply index by PAGE_{CACHE_}SIZE, page->offset 
would be a multiple of PAGE_{CACHE_}SIZE?
And even if it really is PAGE_{CACHE_}SIZE units, this still doesn't solve 
the problem, it just defers it to 16Tib (on ia32 arch with 4kib 
PAGE_{CACHE_}SIZE). With NTFS 3.0's use of sparse files, for the usn 
journal for example, even this will be overflowed at some point on a 
busy/large server. The only proper solution AFAICS is to allow the full 
64-bits.

Sorry, I should have been more detailed in my question, so let me try 
again: When the NTFS file system driver needs to modify the meta data, 
which will be in the page cache (meta data is stored in normal files on 
NTFS, hence the page cache is very well suited to storing it with it's 
page->mapping and page->offset fields), does the NTFS driver need to set 
PG_locked while writing to the page?
And what about reading for that matter? What is the access serialization here?
Obviously I can have several readers on the same metadata at the same time, 
and that's fine, but if someone is writing, then allowing anyone to read 
the data at the same time would result in corrupt meta data being read 
(this is because I am only going to use the page cache, i.e. there will be 
no copying of the data at all, except for: user space <-> page cache <-> 
disk). I am thinking that a read/write semaphore would be the perfect 
solution for this here, but it would be nice, if this could be handled on a 
per page basis rather than a per file basis, at the very least so for meta 
data files.
Thanks,
         Anton
