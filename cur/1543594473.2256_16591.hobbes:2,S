'lo all.  I've got a question about swap and RAM requirements in 2.4.  Now,
when 2.4.0 was kicked out, the fact that you need swap=2xRAM was mentioned.
But what I'm wondering is what exactly are the limits on this.  Right now
I've got an x86 box w/ 128ram and currently 256swap.  When I had 128, I'd get
low on ram/swap after some time in X, and doing this seems to 'fix' it, in
2.4.4.  However, I've also got 2 PPC boxes, both with 256:256 in 2.4.  One
of which never has X up, but lots of other activity, and swap usage seems
to be about the same as 2.2.x (right now 'free' says i'm ~40MB into swap,
18day+ uptime).  The other box is a laptop and has X up when it's awake and
that too doesn't seem to have any problem.  So what exactly is the real
minium swap ammount?
