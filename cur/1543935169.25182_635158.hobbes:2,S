You need to ask the kernel.org administrators for that:

You can have as many maintainers as you want but you probably don't
want to make it too many. There aren't any "official" responsibilities
as a maintainer, it really depends on how much time and effort you're

You don't necessarily need a public git repository before sending your
patches to LKML but yeah, you definitely want some public exposure
before asking for Linus/Andrew to merge your port.
