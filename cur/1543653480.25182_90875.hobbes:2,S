I am just a contributor to NGPT ... what I did was to apply the
concept in Ingo's O(1) scheduling to the selection of tasks waiting
for the futex event.

I did something like that also for the futexes [priority based futexes].
Check the attached patch vs. 2.5.45 [sorry for not inlining it, but I
am w/ Outlook now and it breaks it].
The nice next step would be to go ahead and create a breed of wait queues
that supported priority-based wake up, but there seemed to be not too
much interest; in any case, we'd need to come out with a sollution that
would not waste 2*sizeof(void*) * NUM_PRIO bytes per wait-queue, but
still being O(1) [and now that we are at asking, if somebody knows where
to buy a brand new Mercedes Benz C320 at 25%, pls email me]
