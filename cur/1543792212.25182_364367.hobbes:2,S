No, he's right.
The changes a package maintainer does in a .deb are shipped in one big 
diff containing all the differences between the pristine upstream 
sources and the tree used for building the package.
There are now ways how to arrange the patches in a way that they are 
visible as separate patches inside the unpackaged source tree used for 
building the package [1], but if all you are interested in is to get the 
patches applied against the upstream sources RPM is still superior
(even on my Debian system mc can extract the patches as if the RPM was a 
tar file).
