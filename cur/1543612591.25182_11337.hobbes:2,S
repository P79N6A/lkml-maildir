i knew i shoula been a little less lazy with that one...
haven't looked at your revision yet but we should just clean up and make 
update_lvi self-contained so that it always does *something* appropriate 
regardless of state. maybe that's what you did. ;-)
(fyi, i'm not subscribed to linux-kernel, too much volume for the few 
specific interests i have, i don't see some of this stuff until, and if, 
i go digging thru archives)
