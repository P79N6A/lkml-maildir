We could make use of virt_to_machine/machine_to_virt instead, which 
arguably better describe the intent of those functions. Currently we 
only use virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt in our swiotlb implementation, and our 
modified dma_map code. In those files I think the existing function 
names make some sense, but we can easily change if that's preferred.
