Subject: 2.2.0-pre4: some make xconfig/menuconfig buglets
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/1/4/48

Sysinfo: Dual Pii-350/128MB RAM, Video: ATI RageIIC, ASUS P2B-DS, 
SCSI HD/CDrom System 
1. An 1152x864 screen resolution is not enough to display all fields
in the main menu correctly (must resize manually, under
tcl/TK8.0.3/XFree3.3.3, "Sound" is "squished" afterwards, but useable,
"Kernel Hacking" only reachable via "next" button in sound category...)
2. xconfig: Support for frame buffer devices cannot be set to support ATI
Mach64 display support. Choice for this appears thrice, the first one
directly under all the matrox options, the second one below all of the
Apple Options, and the third one directly before virtual framebuffer
support. The first occurrence is not inactive, but no selection is
possible, the second and third inactive.
(oops, a fourth one appearing out of nowhere, hust below atari
support, also inactive...)
This semms to work in make menuconfig, but there all the choices for
non-intel hardware are not listed.
(A similar/corresponding problem exists with console fonts, which are
accessible as under 2.1.13* under menuconfig but unrespinsive under xconfig)
3. Mice is a submenu in make menuconfig but has its own entry in the
main window when using make xconfig. The same holds true for
V4L/Joystick/Ftape/Network FS/Partition Types options (Pointing back
to the first error reported...)
Thats it for now...
