Here is what the stack looked like;
 EIP is at kfree+0xcd/0xe0
 [<c024228d>] pnp_free_ids+0x1d/0x30
 [<c0241beb>] pnp_release_device+0x1b/0x30
 [<c02555a5>] device_release+0x15/0x20
 [<c02390e3>] kobject_cleanup+0x73/0x80
 [<c0241dac>] pnp_remove_device+0x1c/0xcd
We were releasing an already freed block of memory (this one was slab
poisoned).

Hmm i thought ->remove was per device or do you iterate internally over
all registered driver devices? Thats why i originally did the
pnp_remove_device in the driver's card removal path. How about only
disabling registered devices on final driver unregister?
As an aside where does this fit in with the whole pci_dev business?
