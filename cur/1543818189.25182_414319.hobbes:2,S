Subject: [PATCH 09/17] uml: fix critical typo for TT mode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Noticed this for a compilation-time warning, so I'm fixing it even for TT mode -
this is not put_user, but copy_to_user, so we need a pointer to sp, not sp
itself (we're trying to write the word pointed to by the "sp" var.).
Jeff, have I misunderstood anything?
