Hmmm... I'm feeling very dense today.  At that point, class is either
ATA_DEV_ATA or ATA_DEV_ATAPI.  The if-else clause tries to flip between
the two.
1. if class == ATA_DEV_ATA, the 'if' test succeeds and "class =
ATA_DEV_ATAPI" runs, so it flips correctly.
2. if class == ATA_DEV_ATAPI,  the 'if' test fails and "class =
ATA_DEV_ATA" runs, so it flips correctly.
What am I missing here?  Feel free to scream at me and hammer me into
senses.  :-)
