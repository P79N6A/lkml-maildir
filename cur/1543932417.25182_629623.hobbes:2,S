Subject: [PATCH 7/7] NLM: Add reference counting to lockd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/18/247

...and only have lockd exit when the last reference is dropped.
The problem is this:
When a lock that a client is blocking on comes free, lockd does this in
nlmsvc_grant_blocked():
    nlm_async_call(block->b_call, NLMPROC_GRANTED_MSG, &nlmsvc_grant_ops);
the callback from this call is nlmsvc_grant_callback(). That function
does this at the end to wake up lockd:
    svc_wake_up(block->b_daemon);
However there is no guarantee that lockd will be up when this happens.
If someone shuts down or restarts lockd before the async call completes,
then the b_daemon pointer will point to freed memory and the kernel may
oops.
I first noticed this on older kernels and had mistakenly thought that
newer kernels weren't susceptible, but that's not correct. There's a bit
of a race to make sure that the nlm_host is bound when the async call is
done, but I can now reproduce this at will on current kernels.
This patch is based on Trond's suggestion to add a new reference counter
to lockd, and only allows lockd to go down when it reaches 0. With this
change we can't use kthread_stop here. nlmsvc_unlink_block is called by
lockd and a kthread can't call kthread_stop on itself. So the patch
changes lockd to check the refcount itself and to return if it goes to
0. We do the checking and exit while holding the nlmsvc_mutex to make
sure that a new lockd is not started until the old one is down.
