Struth. (I'm practicing my Australian, it's gotten rusty)
I say that the the only rational way to create a policy is to
decide what you want the system to do and create your policy
based on that. I think that calling something that does nothing
more than enforce existing behavior without thought on what the
behavior ought to be a "policy" does disservice to the entire
security community. I realize that I'm in the minority on this
one. Oh well.
