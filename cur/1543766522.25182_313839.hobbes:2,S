Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Add pci shutdown ability
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Well it seems that people are starting to want to hook the reboot
notifier, or the device shutdown facility in order to properly shutdown
pci drivers to make kexec work nicer.
So here's a patch for the PCI core that allows pci drivers to now just
add a "shutdown" notifier function that will be called when the system
is being shutdown.  It happens just after the reboot notifier happens,
and it should happen in the proper device tree order, so everyone should
be happy.
Any objections to this patch?
thanks,
greg k-h

PCI: Add pci shutdown ability
Now pci drivers can know when the system is going down without having to
add a reboot notifier event.
