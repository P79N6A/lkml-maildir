Hello Halasa !!!
I'm using the generic hdlc layer with PPP protocol against a Lucent MAX6000. 
Everything works OK but there a kernel message bothering me:
	protocol 0008 is buggy, dev hdlc0
I get this message nearly once per minute.
Do anyone know what is this message about ?
Must I worry about that ? 
thanks in advance
