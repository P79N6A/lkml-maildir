How about the possibility to use architecture specific backends? E.g. my 
little Alpha machine has an 8-bit debugging LED port that would be very suited
for this. Or you could use a parallel port in a similar manner (for those 
vga-less server machines...). Other machines may have a LED system display 
for displaying HEX-digits.
So when you use an 8-bit value and display it as 2 hex-digits (ok that would
be 2 assembler insns instead of one..) this kind of devices could be supported
equally well.
