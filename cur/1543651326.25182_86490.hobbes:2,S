No thanks.  That breaks my build scripts.  I don't want to go logging into
multiple machines just to run make oldconfig when the old system worked
perfectly well.
"perfectly well" here means that make oldconfig worked over ssh, with the
local end logging the stdout to a file as well as the terminal, with stdin
from the terminal.  It is quite reasonable to expect the configuration to
continue as normal.
So, here's a patch that adds the necessary fflush to make this situation
work (for me at least.)
