Depends if you insert the capabilities/checksum into single files all over
your file system or in a central /etc/capabilities.conf file. The later is a
bit like other security linux distributions and has clearly the advantage of
beeing more obvious.
The scheme could be extended for non capability related integrity checking.
For exampel all root programs need to be listed there with checksums or
someting like that.
