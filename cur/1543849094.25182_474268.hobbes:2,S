It seems to me that either the warnings are really bugs, in which case 
they should be using BUG/BUG_ON, or they're not really bugs, in which 
case they should be presented differently.

Well, are they bugs or not?  I think people are more confused by the 
"BUG" prefix and stacktrace than helped by it (even an experienced eye 
will glance-parse a BUG+stack trace as a serious oops-level problem 
rather than a warning).
