Yeah, I was a bit brief :)  Look in the top-level Makefile (in
speedbundle) to see how to compile.  The easiest thing to
do though is probably to use the attached top-level Makefile,
which is the same as the current one except that it doesn't
compile the kernel module.  I didn't test it but it should work.
Ciao,
