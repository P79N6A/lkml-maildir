OK, sounds sane enough to me ;)
So the fix is just to let reiserfs_write_inode always be
asynchronous, independent of its arguments, as long as
we're not in fsync() or O_SYNC.
OTOH, if we are called synchronously, we could also just
walk down the code path taken when we _are_ called by
fsync(), right ?
