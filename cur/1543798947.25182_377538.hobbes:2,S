Subject: 2.6.14.4 ide-tape not noticing filemarks

I have a Seagate/Certance ATAPI tape drive, reported thus:
ide-tape: hdd <-> ht0: Seagate STT20000A rev 8A51
ide-tape: hdd <-> ht0: 1000KBps, 6*54kB buffer, 9720kB pipeline, 110ms tDSC, DMA
I've been using this with ide-scsi in Linux 2.4.31 for my backups.  It
worked OK.
I upgraded to 2.6.14.4 and it seem to have lost the ability to detect
filemarks.  This happens whether I use it via ide-scsi or use the
ide-tape interface directly.

  drive status = 512

  Tape block size 512 bytes. Density code 0x0 (default).
  Soft error count since last status=0
  General status bits on (0):
Am I doing something wrong somewhere, or has ide-tape stopped noticing
filemarks reliably/at all?
(I see the same problem on tapes written under 2.4.31 but read under
2.6.14.4, which is why I think it's a problem with reading and not
writing.)
