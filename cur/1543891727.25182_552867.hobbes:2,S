Hmm, in theory it could be triggering bugs in some buggy keyboard
controller. But then a 
while true ; do setleds +caps +numlock ; sleep 1 ; setleds -caps -numlock ; 
sleep 1 ; done
should trigger it too.
 Anyways; it is normally only intended for special
case kdump or other debugging kernels which tend to not get 
much interaction; you shouldn't really set it anywhere else.
I've been also considering to make it always dependent on
a command line option, but that is not done yet.
