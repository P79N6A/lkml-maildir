We mere humans^W device driver people get more confused with barriers
every day, as CPUs get more subtle in their out-of-order-ness.
I think adding longer-named-but-self-explanatory aliases for memory and io
barrier functions can help.
mmiowb => barrier_memw_iow
.... => barrier_memw_memw (a store-store barrier to mem)
....
General template for the name may be something like 
	[smp]barrier_{mem,io,memio}{r,w,rw}_{mem,io,memio}{r,w,rw}
Are there even more subtle cases?
