Well, the good old embedded process is this:
Take what's availlable (2.4.5 then).
Adapt to the hardware.
Test for a while.
Ship it.
Don't touch it anymore.
So what is lunatic about doing the same with 2.6test?  It may make the
test a little more expensive, but the adaptation will be cheaper, so
you are just about even.  And the result is no less frightening than a
2.4.2 kernel with various backports from 2.4.younameit, and even more
quick hacks.
The only thing we agree on is that it would be loony to port known
working hardware to a newer kernel.
