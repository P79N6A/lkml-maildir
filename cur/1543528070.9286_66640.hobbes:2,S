Hi,
     I think the kernel version is a major factor here.  I had a problem with USB not working
with  kernel 2.3.42.  I have a BP6 as well, and I had problems with USB not working under the 
following conditions:
With MPS set to v1.4, USB would not work with kernels from 2.3.20 (or maybe it was 2.3.21)
up until one of the 2.3.44preX kernels.  With kernels in the 2.3.20-2.3.43 range, setting
MPS to v1.1 allows usb to work.
David, do you have MPS set to 1.4?  If so, try 2.3.42 with ACPI enabled, and the MPS set to
1.1 and see if USB works then.  The BP6 has problems with ACPI regardless, but I don't think
that the USB problem is at all related to the ACPI stuff.  Certainly, I have had the ACPI
stuff enabled with 2.3.44 and USB works fine with MPS 1.4.
