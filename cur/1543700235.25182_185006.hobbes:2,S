Yes please if it is forwardable or downloadable.

I believe what you have written because you say it is how the code works.
I take it you mean that the INT is either never latched? or only latched with IS bit
after receipt of first INTA?
It is not obvious in 8259A Datasheet published in Intel Microsystem Components
Handbook Volume 1 1983 nor in datasheet December 1988.
I note the data sheet is almost silent on the topic of INT behaviour without
INTA cycle.
Almost, as the WAVEFORMS diagrams which have INT displayed only
show it in conjunction with the INTA and under said diagram I read
NOTES: Interrupt output must remain HIGH at least until leading edge of first 
INTA.
implying it can go low for some reason?
And the,
1. Cycle 1 in iAPX 86 , ....
Only indicates its trailing edge is synchrouous with the machine cycle.
Figure 10 in the data sheet does not help either as when the IR goes low it has
a LATCH* ARMED notation which I took to mean the INT output was then 
latched.
 
I now think it was referring to the transparent D type latch "REQUEST LATCH"
in the priority cell diagram but I cannot see a footnote to the *.
Could you please point me to the document where it is made clear? It may be
in the i82489DX docs as I do not have them or in a later 8259A data sheet
revision?
Thanks,
Ross.

Clarified thanks.
