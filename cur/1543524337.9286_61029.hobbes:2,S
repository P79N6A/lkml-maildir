Hi,
since about 2.3.36 the NCR scsi controller wasn't detected correctly on my
Alpha
machine:
> scsi-ncr53c7,8xx : at PCI bus 0, device 6,  function 0
> scsi-ncr53c7,8xx : disabling I/O mapping since base address 0 (0x8000)
>         bits 0..1 indicate a non-IO mapping
> scsi-ncr53c7,8xx : NCR53c810 at memory 0x2200000, io 0x0, irq 11
> scsi0 : not initializing, no I/O or memory mapping known
> scsi : 0 hosts.
> scsi : detected total.
I fixed it (by looking at ncr53c8xx.c how it's done there).
regards,
chris
