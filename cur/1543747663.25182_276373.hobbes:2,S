Hello,
I've recently got a SATA capable machine (Via chipset) and I've exprienced a 
nasty hang at boottime, using kernel 2.6.9.
After some recompiling different parameters it boiled down to APIC_IO being 
not selected (this is a UP machine).
Without APIC_IO selected the system would hang while loading SATA.
I've only tried 2.6.5 to notice it would not hang but would emit messeges as 
"hde: lost interrupt", and eventually go on with the boot, the sata being 
unusable.
Out of curiousity, I'd like to know if APIC_IO is absolutly needed when 
dealing with SATA, and also, I'd like to help debug this problem so that a 
kernel compiled without APIC_IO would at the very least not hang...
