A wild guess based on some net/unix/af_unix.c reading turned out to provide
a workaround for my problem.
The client program did:
-----------------------------------
  /* Connect and get a host suggestion */
  antsd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if(antsd == -1)
    fail("Cannot create AF_UNIX socket");
  addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
  strcpy(addr.sun_path, ANTSD_SOCKET);
  
  rc = connect(antsd, (struct sockaddr*)&addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_un));
  if(rc) 
    fail("Cannot connect to antsd socket - antsd not running?");
----------------------------------
Which causes the server to recieve an EOPNOTSUPP upon recvmsg() with
the buffer for the ancillary SO_PASSCRED data.
However,  the following ``fix'' can be applied:
------------------------------
...
  antsd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
...
  addr.sun_family = AF_UNSPEC; /* used to be AF_UNIX */
...
------------------------------
Now, dear networking gurus,  why, oh why, can't I use AF_UNIX for AF_UNIX
sockets   ?
Anyway, now this is in the archives, so if it isn't a programming error on my
part, a workaround is known.  If I'm really doing something wrong (me? wrong? ;),
I should appreciate to be let in on it.
Best regards,
