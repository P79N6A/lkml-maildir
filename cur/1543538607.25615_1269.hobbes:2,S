Subject: bizzare 2.2.16 SCSI problems

I just compiled 2.2.16 and I'm seeing really weird behavior; specifically
when I untar a file, it stops in the middle and won't finish until I move
the mouse.  
I've been using 2.2.15 and 2.4.0-test2-ac2 with the same configuration,
and had no such problem.
Another problem that seems to plague me on 2.2.X kernels is that I'm
getting tons of these messages in dmesg:
VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,1)
VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,1)
VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,0)
VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,0)
I don't seem to get them on the 2.4.0-test2-ac2 kernel, but I get them on
every 2.2 kernel from 2.2.13 on, wether the SCSI support is compiled in or
modules. Occasionally I also get SCSI bus reset messages in my logs too:
Jul 10 22:12:39 sol kernel: <[c010ae6d]> <[c01757fa]> <[c0175875]>
<[c0184431]> <[c01676bf]> <[c0132463]> <[c013294e]> <6>(scsi0:0:6:0) Using
asynchronous transfers. 
Jul 10 22:12:49 sol kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid
47346, scsi0, channel 0, id 6, lun 0 0x1e 00 00 00 00 00  
Jul 10 22:12:49 sol kernel: (scsi0:0:4:0) Synchronous at 10.0 Mbyte/sec,
offset 8. 
That SCSI adaptor is an Adaptec 2940 and has a DVD-ROM and a Panasonic 8x
CD-writer on it, and that's all.  I've also got a Tekram T-390U2B that my
hard disk is on. don't see any problems there.
/proc interrupts looks like this:
$ cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       CPU1       
  0:     432120     444491    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       6163       6110    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard

 14:         75         81    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
NMI:          0

I have no idea what other information might be useful, but I'd be more
than happy to cooperate with anyone who might want to look into this
further.
Oh, the only other difference in my configuration is I also installed the
latest ALSA drivers for the EMU10K1.  They seem to work fine, though I
don't use sound all that often.  
Thanks.
