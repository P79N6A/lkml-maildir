What about clause 5:
5.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
    or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
    are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
    Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
    based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
    License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
This clearly states that you have no rights to distribute anything
unless you accept all the terms of the GPL.
