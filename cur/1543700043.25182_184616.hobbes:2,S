-  In order to use this driver, a char device called wm97xx with a major
-  number of 10 and minor number 16 will have to be created under

-  e.g.
-  mknod /dev/touchscreen/wm97xx c 10 16

   If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
   inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
   say M here.  The module will be called ac97_plugin_wm97xx.o.
