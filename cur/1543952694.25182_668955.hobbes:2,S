Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Generic smp_call_function(), improvements, and smp_call_function_single()

Hi,
While working on the IO CPU affinity bits, I had to convert some more
archs to support smp_call_function_single(). Nicks original patch
for x86-64 also included improvements for smp_call_function(), so
it isn't serialized by call_lock anymore (but still hits call_lock
on every call). I've made further improvements and changes upon that
while converting x86, going further and updating IA64 and PPC made me
realize that we have a lot of shared code for the same functionality.
So I came up with kernel/smp.c that basically just holds the new
and abstracted code for issuing smp_call_function() and
smp_call_function_single() along with the helpers and interrupt
handlers associated. Perhaps a better place would be lib/smp.c, I'm
open to suggestions.
Even with half of this being new functionality, the diffstat still looks
pretty nice:

When/if more archs are converted, it'll of course look even better.
Comments? I've verified that this builts and boots on x86, x86-64
and powerpc. IA64 may still need a one-liner change, I don't have
access to that platform anymore so I can't verify that myself. It
does build, however :-)
The patch series is also available in the 'generic-ipi' branch from
git://git.kernel.dk/linux-2.6-block.git
and the 'io-cpu-affinity' branch is directly based on this.
