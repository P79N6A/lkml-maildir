As Ashok Raj has already responded, there was support for APIC-based MSI[-X]
on ia64 before my patches.  I personally do not know if it worked or not, my
suspicion is that it didn't get much airtime due to MSI being off by default
until somewhat recently.
I believe MSI was working on zx1 after my patch, so I suspect it worked there
before my patch as well.  I can't speak to MSI-X.
Mike, is your driver capable of MSI (vs. MSI-X)?  As a datapoint, could you
try that?
