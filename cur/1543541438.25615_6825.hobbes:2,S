A few minutes ago I put util-linux-2.10o.tar.gz
at the usual places. Don't use metalab.
Distribution makers should at least take the new
fdformat from here - the old one was broken by the
floppy.c permission changes in 2.4.0test6.
[This probably means that also the Changes file now
should point to this version, or at least say that
one needs fdformat from here. By the way, the Changes
file refers to ftp.cwi.nl, and that is not wrong,
but the primary site is ftp.win.tue.nl directory
/pub/linux-local/utils/util-linux .]
