Just tested the latest Linux git, and I see a weird issue:
after some use, my T60 stops triggering any ACPI events:
tail -f /var/log/acpid
does not show anything, even on Fn/F4 which is supposed ot be always enabled.
Restarting the acpid doesn't do anything either - ACPI starts working
again, for a while, only after reboot.
This worked fine in 2.6.18 - any ideas? How to debug this?
