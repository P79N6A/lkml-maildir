But file system page cache writes only call flush_dache_page()
if the page has a non-empty i_mmap_shared list.

No, it examines both lists, the problem is not there.
The issue seems to be some confusion about whether the
test program in question is actually mmap()'ing the area
with PROT_WRITE set, and if so why the test case isn't
passing because in such a case the page will have a non-empty
i_mmap_shared list.
