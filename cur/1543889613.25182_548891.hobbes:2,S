No this patch is not that fragile.  We destroy and recreate the list
each time we call pci_disable_msix, pci_enable_msix.  The order only
matters for the duration of pci_enable_msix.
Yes that silly struct msi_entries *entries vector passed into
pci_enable_msix is that fragile.  The right fix is to just kill that
vector and have the driver walk the list.  That is fundamentally more
robust.

When I get a moment I will remove the need to keep the list in any
sort of order.  That will permanently remove the need for
explanations. 
The truly problematic piece of code is this one below:
	i = 0;
	list_for_each_entry(entry, &dev->msi_list, list) {
		entries[i].vector = entry->irq;
		set_irq_msi(entry->irq, entry);
		i++;
	}
If we don't want to care about order we should really
should make it look something like:
	list_for_each_entry(entry, &dev->msi_list, list) {
        	for (i = 0; i < nvecs; i++) {
                	if (entries[i].vector == entry->entry_nr)
                        	entries[i].vector = entry->irq;
                }
		set_irq_msi(entry->irq, entry);
	}
But that is overkill for a trivial bug fix, and under kill
for a proper fix because the drivers still need to deal with
that complexity.
Letting the drivers walk dev->msi_list should be noticeably more
maintainable long term.  Especially when drivers start using a lot
of msi irqs.
