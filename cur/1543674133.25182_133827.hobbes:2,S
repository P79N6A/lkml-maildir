Well, "lspci -vxxx -d 1039:0008" should be sufficient. If possible 
combined with the pci routing table (from dump_pirq for example).

It would, sure. There are BIOSes in the field which have the 0x62 (USB) 
link included in the routing table for the old register layout. Maybe same 
for 0x61(IDE).

Ok, looks like they have moved the location of the PCI INTA-INTD routing 
registers from 0x41-0x44 to 0x60-0x63. Since this works for you it means 
the vendor/device-id is still 1039:0008. We really need to check the 
revision id here.

Do you really need this bit 6 tweaking? In the current code it's only 
effective for the 0x62 link where it is used to enable the OHCI in the 
southbridge. For most other routing registers it's reserved according to 
the docs - for IDEIRQ (0x61) however it has some different meaning. 
Writing to it for older router revisions might probably make IDE 
unuseable or hang the box in irq storm.
Therefore, for your new 0x60-0x63 register layout I wouldn't suggest 
writing this bit - unless we have some insight there.
So, for your patch I'd suggest to check the PCI_REVISION_ID from the 
config space and apply your new layout for this revision only.

Ok, lets see. IIRC recent MS OSes don't require pci routing table anymore. 
Furthermore we have seen too many broken routing tables. So it's probably 
a big win, if it would work with ACPI...
