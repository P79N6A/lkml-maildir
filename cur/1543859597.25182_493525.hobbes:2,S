I'd say they don't work just now because the virtual class code just
doesn't get called ... at least, without someone setting up a field
(device.class) that's flagged as "optional" and might be disappearing.
But if you read the PM code, you'll observe that the class suspend
method gets called BEFORE the bus/device suspend method.  And that's
how it's documented in Documentation/power/devices.txt too.
... However notice that "interface down" operations won't have that
particular problem, they have net_device.class_dev.dev already ready
for whatever PM operation is appropriate.
