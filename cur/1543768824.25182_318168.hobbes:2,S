because it look like the time is a signed number... but shall i ask how 
counting something that increase can give a negative number?
second... is the counter on the software? until now i thought that the 
counter is a clock on the hardware... so how is this related with Linux? 
then the counter overflow... this will be a hardware issue... not a 
software issue ( the software will have to support the bigger hardware 
counter but to do that the bigger hardware has to exist first...)
BTW is there anyone that plan to use his embedded devise until 2038???? 
i would happy to see that :P any way embedded devises are there so they 
will have sort life cycle... how long are you going to use them 6 
months???? maximum 1-2 years....
so there is no any problem....
