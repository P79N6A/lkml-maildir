Because in kernel/sysctl.c:
int proc_dointvec_bset(ctl_table *table, int write, struct file *filp,
			void __user *buffer, size_t *lenp)
allows init only to set cap_bset.
You can write a module to set cap_bset, of course, or patch the kernel
to define CAP_INIT_EFF_SET to ~0.

I thought there has been a /proc way, to set securebits, but maybe I
confused this with cap_bset. Anyway, here's the easy way out:

This is, where filesystem capabilities come into play. You implemented
them yourself. Execing is still a problem, though. However, if you
activate SECURE_NO_SETUID_FIXUP this issue is gone, too.

Well, I know, that I don't have a strong following. :-)
