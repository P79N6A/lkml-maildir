Works here:
Dual P-166's
64MB RAM
Broke Tomcat II MB (linux handles this fine... NT chokes on it hard)
Adaptec 2940, DPT 2144, Adaptec 1542CF controllers
IBM drives on the DPT, Toshiba CD & Yamaha CDRW on the 2940
running MD in striping mode.
No glitches so far.  Great work!
(I love linux -- wouldn't have even thought about updating a windows 
box across the internet and doing a remote reboot -- came back up great
something about running a ping to it, having the pings drop for 100sec 
and then the machine comes back up running the new kernel is somthing
I just find really cool :)
