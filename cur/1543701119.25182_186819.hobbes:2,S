Without special hardware modifications, it is usually unsafe to share irqs
between isa devices.

You may want to try changing the jumper on your SB16 to allow for PnP
autoconfiguration.

Could I please see a copy of your /proc/interrupts.

The 2.4 series was not always aware of motherboard devices such as serial ports.
Were you able to use ttyS0 and your modem at the same time?
