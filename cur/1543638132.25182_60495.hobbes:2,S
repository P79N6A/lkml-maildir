The kernel is crashing at line 86 of spinlock.h when I run the driver upload
for a Dialogic Voice Board.  It says In Interrupt Handler - not syncing.
This is an application which was written for a uniprocessor environment and
I suspect this to be the issue.  Is there a way to specifically bind an
application and it's children to a specified cpu?
