This rather suggests, there is a problem with UML. Either fix your Kconfig 
to prevent nonvalid configurations or detect and report the problem at 
runtime.

I don't like the two separate lists, it would be easier to just skip all 
absolute path names.
I would also like to avoid this patch at all. If this really should be a 
problem, I'd consider to don't run kconfig at all in this case if there 
is no configuration and instead suggest running defconfig (or one of 
machine specific config targets) first.
bye, Roman
