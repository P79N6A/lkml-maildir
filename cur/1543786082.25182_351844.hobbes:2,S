To this I would add, the kernel should not have warnings when it
compiles.  Now THAT is a style requirement I would rigorously enforce if
I could.  I deeply regret that long ago there was a Linux scsi driver
author who left a warning in, and then after that they started
multiplying throughout the kernel.  It makes users much more confident
when they patch the kernel if there are no warnings that leave them
wondering if the new patch created the warning or if it was there before.
