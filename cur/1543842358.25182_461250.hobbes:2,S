Erm, there's something else going on then:  An ultra 2 card has to have
this register.  It's used to signal mode changes in
ahc_handle_scsiint().  The piece of code in there will trigger and read
this register for any ultra 2 + controller every time there's an error
(just to see if the bus mode changed).
