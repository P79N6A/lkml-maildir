I object to openat().....
My reason is that the things that distinguish between objects should be 
the names, not the choice of system call.  The reason for this is that 
it improves closure and namespace unification to do so, because it 
allows all the objects to be accessed within the same namespace.
Yes, it can be useful to allow a namespace to exclude some objects, but 
that exclusion should not be mandated.  If you want to exclude, you 
should cd or chroot to /proc/nopseudos and find a view of the filesystem 
that excludes metas, or mount with -nopseuodos.
Do you see why I say this?  I can say a lot more about the damage of 
fragmenting namespaces into multiple apis.... Why look at xattrs....;-)
