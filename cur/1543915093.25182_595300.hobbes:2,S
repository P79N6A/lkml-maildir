Well, this is the key info to the user of CPUID. It tells which leaves
are valid to use. Otherwise, the user cannot tell whether the results of
CPUID.0x4000000N are valid or not (i.e. junk). BTW, this is what we are
doing on the native (for the leaf 0, 0x80000000, for example). The fact
that Xen returns 0x40000002 means it only uses 3 leaves today.

Using CPUID.0x4000000N (N > 2) does not prevent Xen from doing that,
either. If you use 0x40001000, 1) you need to say the leaves from
0x40000000 through 0x40001000 are all valid, OR 2) you create/fork a
new/odd leaf (with 0x1000 offset) repeating the detection redundantly.

Again, 0x40000000 is not Xen specific. If the leaf 0x40000000 is used
for any guest to detect any hypervisor, that would be compelling
benefit. For future Xen-specific features, it's safe for Xen to use
other bigger leaves (like 0x40001000) because the guest starts looking
at them after detection of Xen. 
Likewise if KVM paravirtualization interface (as kind of "open source
paravirtualization interface") is detected in the generic areas (not in
vender-specific), any guest can check the features available without
knowing which hypervisor uses which CPUID for that.
