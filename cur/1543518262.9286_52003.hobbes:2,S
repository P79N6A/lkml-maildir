No - "hdparm -I" tells you what the drive answers to an IDENTIFY command
right now. It does actual I/O to the drive. In the good old days "hdparm -i"
would tell you what the drive answered to the IDENTIFY command at boot time.
Today it is just worthless - the meaning of the output depends strongly on
kernel version, and many kernel versions scribble in this identify output
so that it is a strange combination of disk data and kernel data.
The present kernel data is found using "hdparm -g" or "sfdisk -g" or so.
The kernel bootup info ("dmesg | grep hd") tells what happened at boot time.
And "hdparm -I" tells us what the disk says. Usually this information
(together with the kernel version) suffices to solve all problems.

I can hardly imagine that the manufacturer suggests CHS=930/512/63.
Indeed, H cannot be larger than 255.

That is what the disk returns.

Funny - this is really broken output.
RawCHS=16383/16/63 is as it should be, and so is LBAsects=30000096.
But the "CurCHS=65535/1/63, CurSects=4128705" is surprising.
The "LBA CHS=1023/64/63 Remapping" and "LBA CHS=930/512/63 Remapping"
are just hdparm bugs. Must be hdparm 3.5 or so - this is pure fantasy.
So, I was too optimistic when I said that "-I" gave data straight
from the disk - it contains strange nonsense as well.
Shame over the hdparm maintainer, Mark or Andre or whoever put this in.
Once more: "hdparm -i" must give the disk identify answers at boot time.
And "hdparm -I" must give the disk identify answers now.
And the kernel must not change this into what it thinks the disk should have said.
And hdparm must not invent geometries not used by the disk and not
used by the kernel, confusing even more people. This "LBA CHS" junk must go.
