Subject: [PATCH][2.5] rename vector to irq
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Variable renaming may be generally frowned upon, but i think the variable 
name 'vector' really confuses things at this specific code location seeing 
as it's not actually a vector as referred to for the IDT. With the 
idt_descr and irq_entries_start being really closely knit it can really 
confuse someone new to the code.
