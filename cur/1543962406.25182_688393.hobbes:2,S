Raid protects against disk failure. So your use  is fine.
Backup also protects against user error and virus/worm/cracker damage.
If you accidentally overwrite a file, or a virus/worm/cracker messes up 
the filesystem,
then RAID loose because the overwiting/messing happens on both disks.
In that case you'll still be able to get stuff from a backup.
