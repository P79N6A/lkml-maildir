It is usually the kernel that togles the leds, except when an application (like 
X) requests that the keyboard be put into RAW mode. In RAW mode it is the 
application that is responsible to for updating the leds. If X hangs, Caps-Lock 
and the like will not make the leds toggle anymore.
You can try to issue a SysRq+R to take the keyboard out of RAW mode into XLATE 
so that the kernel translates the keys and you might be able to toggle leds, 
switch consoles, etc.
