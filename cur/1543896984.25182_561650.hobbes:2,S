Sorry, it was probably me who messed things up. It looks like it's not
usb-storage who's preventing suspend here. I have this diff between a
single user mode where I can suspend and a multiuser environment where
suspend hangs, will go loading the missing modules one by one and get a
better idea...
Sorry for the noise.
