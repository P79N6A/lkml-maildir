First of all, thanks for looking at this, Al.  
I think Oren's assumption here is that all tasks possibly sharing the
table would be frozen.  I don't think that's a good assumption,
either. :)
This would be a lot safer and bulletproof if we size the allocation
ahead of time, take all the locks, then retry if the size has changed.
I think that will just plain work of we do this:

Ugh, that certainly doesn't have any place here.  I do wonder if Oren
had some use for that in the fully put together code, but it can
certainly go for now.
I'll send patches for these shortly.
