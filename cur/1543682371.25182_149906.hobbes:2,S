Hi,
  Is there any information on decoding AMD Athlon MP Machine
check exceptions?  I can't seem to find the appropriate AMD
document on their website - it would be nice to know
if this is RAM or cache or something else that gave it.
The error reported is:
Jul 19 21:07:37 gallifrey kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal,
correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
Jul 19 21:07:37 gallifrey kernel: Bank 2: 940040000000017a
Thats from 2.5.75 on a dual Athlon MP on a Tyan 760MP motherboard.
The machine has apparently been running fine for some time now - perhaps
this is heat related due to the unusually warm weather over here,
or perhaps it is the machine check polling picking
up something that has been going dodgy for a while.
Dave
