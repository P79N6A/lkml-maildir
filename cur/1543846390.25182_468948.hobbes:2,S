Actually I looked at the code more closely. It looks like kernel math
emulation is much more broken. e.g. kernel_fpu_begin() is missing
code and lots of other paths in i387 that need to check HAVE_HWFP don't.
Fixing it properly would be much more work.
Since it evidently hasn't worked for a long time I'm thinkin about
just marking it CONFIG_BROKEN and deprecating it for 2.6.20
