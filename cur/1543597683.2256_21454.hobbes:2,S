Back in the old 2.0 days there was a couple of HOWTOs that discussed what 
hardware worked and didn't work under Linux.  I remember using the 
Ethernet-HOWTO as a "shopping list" when going to ham fests, "Wierd Stuff", 
and similar consignment/surplus/boneyard houses.  Have these HOWTOs been 
maintained?
(I've noticed that a number of very, very useful HOWTOs have fallen into 
the "unmaintained" category.)
I happen to think that "stories around the campfire" are fine, but with an 
OS like Linux we should have the "Campfire FAQ"...  :)
