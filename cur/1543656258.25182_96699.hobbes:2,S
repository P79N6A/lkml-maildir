I see the light! Thank you.

From what I can see, HT provides a 0-15% increase in performance, depending
heavily on the type of code being run. In other words, HT helps, but it is
*no* substitute for true multiple processors. And it is ONLY of value when
an SMP kernel is in use.
What you're seeing meshes with my results: our perfromance gains from HT are
about the same. HT didn't lose either of us anything, but it sure as heck
didn't make the kind of difference the hype seems to imply.
As for REAL SMP: I posted some more numbers on my web site (URL below),
using the same gcc compile test on my dual-proc with PIII-600s. Using a
single process, the compile took just under a 100 minutes, while with two
processes, it finished in 58.5 minutes. Real SMP reduced the time by 40%
(again, similar to your numbers).
