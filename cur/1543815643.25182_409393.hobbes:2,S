                    Method (I2RB, 3, NotSerialized)
                    {
                        Store (Arg0, HCSL)
                        Store (ShiftLeft (Arg1, 0x01), HMAD)
                        Store (Arg2, HMCM)
                        Store (0x0B, HMPR)
          /*              Return (CHKS ())*/
