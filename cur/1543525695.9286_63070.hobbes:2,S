editing .config is my prefered way to configure the kernel.
i remove lines i don't like, run "make oldconfig" to add these
lines with different parameters and let the kernel do cleanups.
but now i noticed, in new 2.3.* kernels .config contains the comment
"don't edit". i wonder why, it always worked very fine this way.
regards, andreas
