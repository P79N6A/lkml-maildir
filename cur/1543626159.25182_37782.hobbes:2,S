You obviously didn't read that thread.  Both in the context of
BitKeeper and in the context of normal data, you would have seen that
we have backups, we just have backups that we can verify are correct.
The repositories on bkbits.net are automirrored after each incoming event.
There were a few ppc ones which were not and we're still trying to figure
out why, and things like the .ssh keys were not completely backed up;
we're fixing that by putting that information into a BK repository so
it will just automirror like everything else.
I'm not sure why you yanking my chain, it's counter productive and 
flat out rude after I just spent two days doing nothing but putting 
things back together for kernel developers.  What, exactly, did you
hope to accomplish?
