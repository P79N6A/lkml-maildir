Hi all
I'm alive and mostly well (yay!). I still should _not_ be spending extended 
periods on the computer for my neck but this last change was I believe 
essential and not too much effort.
Here's an update which should improve behaviour further with niced tasks.
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/staircase-deadline/2.6.20.5-sd-0.40.patch
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/staircase-deadline/2.6.21-rc6-sd-0.40.patch
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/staircase-deadline/2.6.21-rc6-mm1-sd-0.40.patch
The last patch (which is for 2.6.21-rc6-mm1) can be used as an incremental 
from any 0.39 patched kernel.
Pretty much all of the architectural stuff for SD and bugfixes are done now. 
Barring bugs/fixes, I plan to start work on implementing SCHED_ISO and 
SCHED_IDLEPRIO for it for -ck over the next few weeks, but only once I'm 
_completely_ well, meaning extended periods offline again (sorry to those who 
are emailing me I'm not ignoring you intentionally!).
