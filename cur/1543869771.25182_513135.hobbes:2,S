    After doing this, I no longer can garble the display (before, just a
"ls -lR /" was enough to do it, in fact, any big output garbled the
display). The only problem with this solution is that the scroll speed
has decreased a bit. In fact, the scroll speed is affected by the vyres
parameter a lot! The highter the vyres, the faster the scroll, and I
cannot reproduce the problem anymore after changing it once!
    I'm really confused :?
    Thanks a lot for the fix :)
