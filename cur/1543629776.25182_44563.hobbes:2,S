ah.. not spurious.

the server i have has no network connectivity via that interface while 
this is going on.
anyway... i rebooted the machine and (so far, touch wood, fingers 
crossed) it hasnt shown the problem so far. (odd cause i rebooted the 
thing several times last friday and it didnt clear the problem).
/before/ the reboot i set multicast_filter_limit=1, downed the 
interface, removed the module and upped it again (after waiting) but 
this made no difference. however, the reboot (with this parameter set) 
made a difference where before reboots made no difference.
anyway, Richard, have you spoken to andrey (saw@saw.sw.com.sg -
current maintainer) about your fix and whether it is proper or not?
regards,
