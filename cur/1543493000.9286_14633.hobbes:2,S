   This leads me to believe that the Solaris local UFS read ahead is somehow
   mistimed with the NFS read ahead and thus causing a large delay
   on the reads.  This is just a guess and I'm still working on it.
One thing that confused Tru64 Unix a while back was Sun clients writing
to Tru64 servers.  We only support 8KB (or less) I/O sizes, and the Sun
clients really wanted to do 32 KB.  So, we'd see the first 8 KB of many
32 KB chunks, then the 2nd 8 KB, then 3rd, then 4th.  Then the pattern
would repeat with the next set of I/Os.
One (or both?) of our physical file systems saw this pattern and wrongly
concluded that the client was doing random access I/O, and that lead to
inefficient block allocation.  If Linux clients do read ahead, that
might be confusing Solaris.  Perhaps the 4 KB I/O size doesn't trigger
readahead.  Hmm. If you read a file that you just created on Solaris,
I'd expect that to be in Solaris's cache and it shouldn't need to read
from the disk anyway.
One thing sorely missing from this mail list discussion is tcpdump (or snoop)
data.  A good snippet from a tcpdump trace can expose all sorts of
interesting issues.
I understand you're using Solaris, but for the benefit of others,
on Tru64/Digital Unix systems, adding:
	options	NTP_TIME
	options	MICRO_TIME
	options	PACKETFILTER
to the configuration file will build in packet filter support and allow
tcpdump to report timestamps at the microsecond level.
