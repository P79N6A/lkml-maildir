Unfortunately, EROS is still based on the PC hardware as
we've got it today and not modeled after a JINI-like
appliances model (the network is the computer).
With the death of the monolithic computer (if it happens)
will come the death of Unix, Windows _and_ EROS.
At the moment I can see only one Open Source system that
could become ready for a world like that.  Alliance OS
(

).
