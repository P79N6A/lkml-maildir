eh. Perhaps I should have said that differently. And TiVO could handle it 
differently. I'm not going to argue about it anymore. It's pointless.

No argument there. However, that is not to say that "you bought it, now you're 
free to do with it whatever you please" is always what the law says (at least 
in the US)
In the TiVO case there may be restrictions placed on the manufacturer for 
legal reasons or contractual reasons. Seeing as I'm not privy to the 
contracts between TiVO and the various production and broadcasting companies 
I can't comment on what contracts they have. As to the legal side there are 
restrictions in copyright law.

I know of at least one company that will sell you the parts to repair your TV 
if its out of warranty.

Dialup is like pissing through a pipette. Slow and excruciatingly painful.
