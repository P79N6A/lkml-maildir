#if 0
If the comparison was made unsigned, cast to the largest natural
value on the target, while keeping the types and sizes of the
input variables the same, this macro does about what 99.9999999 percent
of what everybody wants:
#endif
#include <stdio.h>
#define min(a,b) ((size_t)(a) < (size_t)(b) ? (a) : (b))
int main()
{
    printf("%d\n", min(1,2));
    printf("%d\n", min(-1,2));
    printf("%d\n", min(0xffffffff,3));
    printf("%d\n", min(0x8000,4));
    printf("%d\n", min(0x7fff,5));
    printf("%d\n", min(0x80000000,6));
    printf("%d\n", min(0x7fffffff,7));
    printf("%ld\n", min(1L,2L));
    printf("%ld\n", min(-1L,2L));
    printf("%ld\n", min(0xffffffff,3L));
    printf("%ld\n", min(0x8000,4L));
    printf("%ld\n", min(0x7fff,5L));
    printf("%ld\n", min(0x80000000,6L));
    printf("%ld\n", min(0x7fffffff,7L));
    printf("%lu\n", min(1L,2LU));
    printf("%lu\n", min(-1L,2LU));
    printf("%lu\n", min(0xffffffff,3LU));
    printf("%lu\n", min(0x8000,4LU));
    printf("%lu\n", min(0x7fff,5LU));
    printf("%lu\n", min(0x80000000,6LU));
    printf("%lu\n", min(0x7fffffff,7LU));
    printf("%d\n", min(-1, -2));
    printf("%d\n", min(-1, 0));
    printf("%p\n", min((void *)0x80000000, (void *)0x7fffffff));
    return 0;
}

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
