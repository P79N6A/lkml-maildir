Hey all,
I got the OSS module for soundblaster 16
compiled into a 2.2.10 kernel.
At times, when i try to use /dev/sb the kernel error log gives
me a warning "Can´t allocate dma buffer".
The reason why i would call this rather funny is
because there seems to be no relation to any action taken whatsoever.
Sometimes it comes right after boot up, then again not for hours.
When it appears i usually go get a drink and when i get back
it is gone.
Huh?
Niko
