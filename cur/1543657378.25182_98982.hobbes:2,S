I'm certainly going to be interested in Linux/Sparc >= 2.5 when I can
get a Sparc machine, (I'm hoping to help work on the 'Splack'
distribution, which is basically an un-official Slackware-like
distribution for Sparcs), with the eventual aim of moving from X86 to
Sparc as my default architechture, but I'm not really interested in
Alpha.
What's the status of the 2.5 Sparc tree?
John.
