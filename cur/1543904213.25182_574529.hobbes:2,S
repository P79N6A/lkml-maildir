Just having the other tree and managing it is what makes me a little
less positive of this approach, especially using it to store pagecache
state when we already have the pagecache tree.
Having another tree to store block state I think is a good idea as I
said in the fsblock thread with Dave, but I haven't clicked as to why
it is a big advantage to use it to manage pagecache state. (and I can
see some possible disadvantages in locking and tree manipulation overhead).
