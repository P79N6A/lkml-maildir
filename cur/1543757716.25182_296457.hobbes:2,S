I've just extracted the requested info from the files I've put on web.
Here it is:

The 4MB area should be AGP aperture, as it was set in BIOS to 4MB only
The files on web contain concatened infor from dmes, iomem, interrupts, mtrr, lspci:
http://www.natur.cuni.cz/~mmokrejs/tmp/4MB/2.4.30-pre1-bk5
http://www.natur.cuni.cz/~mmokrejs/tmp/4MB/2.6.11-rc4-bk7
So, 2.6 kernel does not see AGP aperture area. What to do next? ;)
