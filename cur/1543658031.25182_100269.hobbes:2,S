Absolutely.

I don't even think there should be any such case, 
as the real point in having LGPL is, supposedly, to 
support *interfacing*, so using headers (source-code 
*interfaces*) and linking to stuff (binding binary 
*interfaces*) should be just fine under LGPL (or a 
better LGPL? IGPL? dunno the details that deep, sorry).
