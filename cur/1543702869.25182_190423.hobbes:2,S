Yes, I'm use reiserfs in 2.6.1 with laptop_mode patch. It works fine for me, I use cpudyn daemon to let spin download harddisk. In cpudyn.conf
I changed TIMEOUT from 120 to 10. When i reading email/web, the harddisk can spin down for very long time (>3min). 
So you can try cpudynd.
# TIMEOUT=120
TIMEOUT=10
# 
# Specified disks to spindown (comma separated devices)
#
# DISKS=/dev/hda,/dev/hdb
DISKS=/dev/hda
