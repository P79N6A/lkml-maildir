I hadn't realised that the DOS partition table was restricted to 2T
maximum, and so I must apologise for the confusion...

The FAT28 format already supports more than 2T per partition, so
there's no problem from that point of view. At worst, one could just
put that on the raw disk...

FAT12 and FAT16 both allocate a total of 18 reserved cluster numbers,
being clusters numbered 0 and 1, plus the 16 highest possible cluster
numbers. As a result, they support a maximum of 4078 and 65518
clusters respectively...
Assuming FAT28 follows the same rule, it will support 268,435,438
clusters instead of the 268,435,456 that would be supported if every
possible cluster number could be used. To be honest, that shortfall of
18 clusters is meaningless when taken out of that sort of maximum...
For reference, a FAT32 partition following the same rules could
allocate 4,294,967,278 clusters out of a maximum of 4,294,967,296, and
that same difference of 18 clusters means even less there...
Best wishes from Riley.
