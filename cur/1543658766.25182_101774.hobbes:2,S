Systems running the latest RH, SuSE releases, with standard smp kernel
should see some entries in /proc/cpuinfo, which gives information about
HT configuration on the system. The latest 2.5 kernel also has similar
information in /proc/cpuinfo.
The entries look something like:
Physical processor ID   : 0
Number of siblings      : 2
Unfortunately, 2.4.19 doesn't have such information. One possible
workaround is to check big enough 'dmesg' and look for cpu_sibling_map.
That tells you the mapping of logical processors to physical package. Or
you can have a init script like this (attached) in place, to run at boot
time, so that you have a better chance of finding these particular
messages in log (without overflowing).
HTH,
