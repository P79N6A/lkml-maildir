The fix is wrong for accelerated displays.
rinfo->pitch should be initialized previously, but then, I'm not sure
what version of radeonfb James actually has in his tree. I'm mostly
rewriting it now, though my "new" version hasn't been submited yet,
it's definitely not ready.
I could eventually submit an updated "old" version though...
