On the HRT sourceforge page you'll find the i386 version of the tick less system
patch. The initial s390 patch can be found here:

I do agree that is very likely a bad idea to do a tick less system for i386 and
friends. I still haven't given up the idea for s390 though. I plan to use the
cpu timer for all the process related stuff and the clock comparator for the
wall clock. This adds just two instructions to the system call entry path:
a store cpu timer "stpt" and a set cpu timer "spt" to switch from the process
cpu timer to the system cpu timer. The overhead is 27 cycles and benefit is
no more ticks and a much more accurate process accounting. This requires some
major surgery in the common timer code. I'm going to have fun with this.
