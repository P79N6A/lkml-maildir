Greetings,
Can you (or anyone) point me to a clue-x-4 to get rid of this?
(II) R128(0): Acceleration enabled
(II) R128(0): Using hardware cursor (scanline 3606)
(II) R128(0): Largest offscreen area available: 1600 x 5787
(**) Option "dpms"
(**) R128(0): DPMS enabled
(II) R128(0): Direct rendering disabled
I've been wanting to see what X can do with dri for a while now,
but alas the bugger isn't being cooperative.
Any replies off list please.
