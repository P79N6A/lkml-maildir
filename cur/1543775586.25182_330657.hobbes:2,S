They cost almost nothing, and in all cases, far less than the required code
to autodetect them. You just need to create /dev/sda{,0-15} for an USB disk,
and you may need to to this for sdb and/or sdc if you plan to support multiple
USB storage devices simultaneously plugged. And if your embedded system already
carries SCSI disks (which is very rare, except for example external arrays),
then you're in trouble already. Maybe sysfs can help you, I don't know.

"analysing by hand" is a bit excessive. I don't think the difference between
   for part in /dev/sda*; do
     mkdir -p /mnt/${part#/dev/}
     mount $part /mnt/${part#/dev/}
   done
and :
 
   while read maj min blo part; do
     case $part in sda[1-9]*)
       mkdir -p /mnt/$part
       mount /dev/$part /mnt/$part
     esac
   done </proc/partitions
is so important.
Now I agree that devfs might have made it easier to find the sd* devices
associated to the usb-storage device, but it is totally independant on
your problem of creating lots of /dev entries in advance.

Willy
