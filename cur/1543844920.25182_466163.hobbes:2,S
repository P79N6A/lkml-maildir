On what architectures do you see lots of these warnings - maybe fixable?
Otherwise I could do something like this:
diff --git a/scripts/Makefile.modpost b/scripts/Makefile.modpost
index 4b2721c..e9efe61 100644
--- a/scripts/Makefile.modpost
+++ b/scripts/Makefile.modpost
@@ -58,7 +58,7 @@ quiet_cmd_modpost = MODPOST $(words $(fi
 	$(if $(KBUILD_EXTMOD),-i,-o) $(kernelsymfile) \
 	$(if $(KBUILD_EXTMOD),-I $(modulesymfile)) \
 	$(if $(KBUILD_EXTMOD),-o $(modulesymfile)) \
-	$(if $(KBUILD_EXTMOD),-w) \
+	$(if $(KBUILD_EXTMOD)$(KBUILD_MODPOST_WARN),-w) \
 	$(wildcard vmlinux) $(filter-out FORCE,$^)
 
 PHONY += __modpost
Then:
make KBUILD_MODPOST_WARN=1
would warn and not fail.
Note: I beleive the patch has been in -mm for a while.
      Got the patch via akpm
