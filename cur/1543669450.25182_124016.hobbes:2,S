Subject: [patch] nuke unused smp_msg_data, smp_src_cpu & smp_msg_id
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/4/9/243

Patch to remove some declarations that are so dead it's not even funny
anymore.
I believe the MSG_* macros shouldn't be there either, but it looks
like some PPC{,64} and SPARC code may still rely on them.
