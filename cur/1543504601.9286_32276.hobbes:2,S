Under _Windows_ both are valid. Do you really think this brain dammage
should be kept in Linux? There is no reason for the short name to be
visable _except_ when there are interactions with DOS, this comes down
to dosemu, samba and backups.

Yes, I thought of this but the coding would be horrific. I think this would
work out to be just the same as using a directory by directory sfn_backup,
and IMO it's better to do it in userspace and keep those horrors from the
kernel.
