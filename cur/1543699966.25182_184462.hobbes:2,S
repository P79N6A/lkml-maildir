Well, if you're going to generalize the model, I would think that you
would want some form of local locking within each level, so you don't do
excess locking in NUMA config. It might be that you specify a lock and
lock type for each level, and the type of lock for shared L1 cache
siblings could be NONE.
I'm not sure what kind of generalized model you have in mind for the
future, so I may be totally off in the weeds, but I would assume that a
lock would ideally have some form of locality. In the came socket, on the
same board, on the same backplane, same rack, same room, same planet,
whatever.
