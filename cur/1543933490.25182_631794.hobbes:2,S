Yes, if i do that, the fs clean again, and works well until we moves big
amount of data on the storage.
But the problem comes out again, and again.
If i can, i will try the latest stable kernel, with some loop fixes, but it
is not too easy.
This is a productive system.

Yes.

No, this is the "old way", not the dmcrypt.
This is cryptoloop.

I dont know exactly, but in my log it is always a write failures! ( i think
from rw=1 and lost page write messages)
It is the readahead important in this case?

Ok, what is the next step? :-)
(i will try the latest kernel, if i can....)
Can i switch to dmcrypt from cryptoloop without rebuild the fs?
Thanks a lot,
