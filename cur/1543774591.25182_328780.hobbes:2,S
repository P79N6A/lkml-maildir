I think that what Hans is trying to say is that the functionality
that is handled by plugin_operations are a different dimension or
vector from the inode/file/dentry etc. operations.
Whether he is right or not is part of the discussion.
and "plugin" is a bad name :(
Is part of the problem that plugins are too extensible?
I.e., the plugin_operations methods can do almost anything?
I would want to see a list of methods that should be supported and then
a reasonable infrastructure for supporting those.
Pick one (like metadata) and drill down on how to support that.
