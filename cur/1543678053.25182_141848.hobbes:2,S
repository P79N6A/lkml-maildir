Hi,
I am a bit confused about which driver a need for my onboard (Asus
P4C800 mobo) 3Com gigabit Ethernet controller. It should be a 3C940 but
sometimes it's called 3C2000. I found a driver at the asus site which
compiles and works with some kernel versions. Is there a proper (open
source) kernel driver for this chip? It seems that the tg3 driver
support some type of 3C940 but not mine.
lspci -n gives:
02:05.0 Class 0200: 10b7:1700 (rev 12)
This chip is also currently not defined in pci_ids.h (2.4 and 2.5)
Thanks,
Jurgen
