Whenever I run a ACPI battery monitor in X, my mouse goes completely 
insane - goes around everywhere, and clicks randomly. the second i close 
it, everything returns to normal.
Logs show no suspicious output when this happens.
I used wmbattery that Joey Hess edited to work with 2.5 ACPI, I have 
posted it a website but I'm not sure whether it's GPL-compliant to post 
it there and give the URL in this message without the source diff.... 
does anyone care at this point?
Regards
Josh
