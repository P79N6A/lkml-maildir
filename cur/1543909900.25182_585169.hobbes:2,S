And if you purpose is only to download that tree, my suggestion is that
some of the git trees are not public like linux-arm so the owner can do
whatever he likes in the tree, and don't ever try to have access to it.
for linux-arm, it will be constantly pulled by Linus, unless you really
want the _most_ up-to-date patches, which you might find them at
  
http://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/pub/armlinux/kernel/git-cur/
that folder will be constantly refreshed by the maintainer.
