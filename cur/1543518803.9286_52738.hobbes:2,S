Sort of. The setup is: 
        peer1 (2.2.13) 
        ---10 MBit/s half-duplex(stable)---> router (Pentium 120/Linux 2.0.38 AFAIR)
        ---768 kBit/s(flaky)--> some cisco
        ---4-fast-and-stable-hops--> Ascend Max
        ---64 kBit/s(stable)--> peer2 (2.2.13).
flaky is: burst blackouts. I. e. some packets in a row are missing, then
the link is stable for like 15 seconds, than blacks out for 4 seconds
and so on. 
Loss analysis by mtr (combined ping/traceroute). Network exhibits same
blackouts if I address my pings to the router rather than peer1.
This is for ping router from peer2: 
94 packets transmitted, 67 packets received, 28% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 70.184/127.923/460.765 ms
The "some cisco" has these stats:
16 packets transmitted, 16 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 59.225/80.703/140.998 ms

This is the setup.

Yup. Still, the net we're talking about IS egoistic (people move CDs
through the net rather than carry them over a couple of 10 metres), and
it has about 70 Win95, Win98, WinNT, Linux hosts on the 768 kBit/s
link. 
I'm not quite sure (haven't digged that deep), it might be that the 768
kBit/s actually is an asymmetric DSL (assumedly Deutsche Telekom 768/128
kBit/s) which MIGHT confuse the congestion avoidance as well.
