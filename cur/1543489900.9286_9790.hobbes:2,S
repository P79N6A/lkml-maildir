I want to understand that parts are allocating memory and that once they 
have them they can do what they want with the memory, even to send
references to other parts as devices or anything they want to. If 
they are kind enough to free some when they are asked for, it is 
still better. :-)
A part than only requires physical memory chunks shorter than 1 PAGE
size to succeed is a part that makes good use of allocations.

I may want to do that if I am able to easily scatter the thing into
physical chunks on PAGE boundaries, otherwise I dont want. I also want to
get contiguous chunks when I ask for less than 1 PAGE.
And I donnot want from the part to have to guess as memory is handled by 
the kernel.

I use 2.0 most of the time, donnot want to ever use NFS and the SCSI
driver I use never allocate more than 1 PAGE. Prior to use anything that 
allocate more than 1 PAGE at a time, I will fix it or modestly:) try to
fix it.

I may want to defrag for the system to perform better, but I donnot want
to be required to defrag for the system to work.

The problem with defragmentors is that they may let think that the system
is working fine when it just close to die at any time. So, I do prefer a 
system that does not require a defragmentor in order to just work.
