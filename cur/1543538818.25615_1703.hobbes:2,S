Issueing warnings when we're low on swap is probably a
good idea. Just send in the patch and it'll probably get
integrated...

This is lunacy. If we're out of memory, how can we allocate
the memory to do a pop-up message?  And where should that
menu appear?  On what console of which user?  What if we're
a webserver at 4 AM?
A semi-intelligent OOM killer inside the kernel is perfectly
doable, however, since that doesn't need to allocate any memory
to do its work. A patch for this is readily available and with
a bit of luck it has already been integrated into the latest
2.2.17pre kernel...
regards,
Rik
