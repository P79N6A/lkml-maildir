Hello,
I am sure that I am not the only one who apply multiple paches over
every kernel, no?
For example for 2.2.9, devfs, PIII, and ac3...
Is there a tool that took the patches you want, apply what isn't in
two (or more...) of them, and give you a choice from which one you
want what?
I don't know about the possibility of such a tool...
Thanks for reading.
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
