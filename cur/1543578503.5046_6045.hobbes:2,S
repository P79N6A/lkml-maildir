Summary: When booting 2.4.0 on x86 with 2GB of memory, the initial
ramdisk fails to mount. The initial ramdisk is 48MB.
Debugging so far: I can increment and decrement the memory in 512MB
intervals. The initial ramdisk does mount with 512MB of
memory installed, but does not with 1GB+ of memory installed.
I would appreciate any help I can get on this, thanks in advance.
