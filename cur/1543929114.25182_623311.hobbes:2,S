I have an implementation with a global array, but will have to
change it over to a per-radix tree implementation (not that
hard, with the slab reclaiming code) and per-cgroup reclaiming
information.
That way we can figure out per mapping, per cgroup or system
wide reclaim info (though not all at the same time).

I did mean the RSS limit, not a virtual memory limit.
What exactly are all the terminologies you use that
I need to be aware of? :)
