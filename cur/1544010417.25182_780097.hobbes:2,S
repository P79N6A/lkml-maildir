Quite a lot.  Most notably the section I have on publishing changes by GIT
tree.  It's taken a lot of experimentation to work out how to do it, and I'm
sure it can be done better.  I hadn't managed to find anywhere on the web
describing how to do it that I could follow, and no-one that I asked was really
willing to help me set it up.
I have a number of crib sheets that I've cobbled together to note how to do
things that I can cut and paste from, so I turned them into a document.
