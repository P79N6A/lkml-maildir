Subject: [Suspend2][ 07/28] [Suspend2] Reset swapwriter when not resuming.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/468

Reset the device info and close bdevs when we set up when preparing to
resume. This might happen because of a problem, or because noresume2 was
given on the command line and we needed first to invalidate the image.
