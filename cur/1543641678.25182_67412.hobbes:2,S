No, but using serport.c, you can bind a serio to a tty via a line
discipline, for example if you want a PC serial mouse on /dev/ttyS0 to
talk to sermouse.c via serio. I don't like the approach much, I hope(d) we
could switch somewhere below the tty layer, but it sort of works, and
maybe will have the bugs fixed sooner or later.
