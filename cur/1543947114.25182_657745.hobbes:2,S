Correct.

It didn't.  Ian confirmed the allocation comes from the kernel's 
pagetable setup.  The domain builder always puts pagetables after the 
kernel, so over 1M.

Linux.  Which suggests a latent bug.

For PV guests, Xen itself isn't really interested in any of the platform 
bios/hardware (not even acknowledging its existence, let alone emulate 
anything).  Definitely no magic memory ranges or scanning for 
signatures.  The in-kernel Xen support has made some concessions to that 
sort of stuff, by making sure various memory ranges are valid to be 
scanned, even if they don't contain anything meaningful.  We could do 
something like that for DMI if that turns out to be the best answer.

It seems to me that those pages are being handed out as heap pages by 
the early allocator.  In the Xen case this is OK because there's nothing 
magic about them.  But if real hardware doesn't reserve these pages in 
the E820 map, then they could end up being used as regular memory by 
mistake, which is an issue.
