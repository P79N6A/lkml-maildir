I find it annoying that ifenslave is still hosted by the kernel. I made
this mistake years ago because it was not hosted anywhere and I needed
to make changes available somewhere, but it should move to somewhere
else, either as a standalone package on sf.net, or added to an existing
package such as ifconfig, or better merged with it. I even think that
if ifconfig included all ifenslave, vconfig, ethtool and brctl functions,
it wouldn't be abandonned as it is now, but this is another problem.
Regards,
Willy
