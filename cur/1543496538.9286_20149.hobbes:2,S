Do you still run xntpd? I tried to reproduce here with userspace and now
that the `write' code got compiled from real, I can't reproduce the
time-warp anymore. What I do is to run your gettimeofday checker in
background and then I run two proggy that does a cli() and a loop for some
time, and then sti(). Your proggy don't complain anymore here with the #if
bug fixed. But I am not playing with settimeofday.

Because nobody has the CPU masked from userspace for more than 100msec.

It's been a merging error. It make no one difference at all (except it's a
bit slower :-). Anyway I fixed it now, next patches will be fixed. Thanks.
