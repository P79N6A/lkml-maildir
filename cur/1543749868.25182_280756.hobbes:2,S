When I mentioned queueing, I was thinking of a netpoll-private queue
that would be hooked to a softirq or some such so that it would be
pushed out as soon as possible. Dropping may be the better approach as
queueing throws away netpoll's immediacy and ordering properties. And
getting netpoll _more_ tangled in the net stack mechanics is
definitely a step in the wrong direction.
More generally, I'm tempted to add some warn_on style functionality so
that printks in such troublesome paths can be lifted out.
