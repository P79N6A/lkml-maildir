Hello,
It seems like linux replaces sock with tcp_tw_bucket structure in the
sock list in order to "work around the memory consumption problems for
the heavilly loaded server". 
The header file tcp.h  has some comments before declaring
"tcp_tw_bucket" structure. It is done in tcp_input.c.
But anyway, tcp_tw_bucket is never identical to sock structure. This
is a serious hack and I'm suprised no linux kernel documentation talks
about it.
I just wanted to let others know so that no one else faces this
problem.
