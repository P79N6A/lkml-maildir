Subject: [PATCH 0/52] First attempt at smp integration

Hi,
This series of patches does a first attempt at smp integration (I call it first, 
although I don't believe it's too far away from a real one). The series comprises 52 patches,
and the full diffstat says in the end:
	 34 files changed, 1858 insertions(+), 2344 deletions(-)
smp_32.c and smp_64.c are completely gone. smp.h and smpboot_{32,64}.c are not, although
substantially reduced. I know that ideally, no leftovers are wanted, but the series were
already big enough (I tried to split the patches as much as I could), so I considered this 
a good cutting point. If this is all agreed upon and merged, I'll start looking at the other 
bits that are left.
All patches are tested is various random x86 subarchitectures, and all of them works.
The result also boots fine in mine x86_64 and i386 boxes.
Comments are welcome.
