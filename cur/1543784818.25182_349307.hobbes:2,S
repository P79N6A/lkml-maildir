Nope. Only server-side smart protocols will handle this.
There is such an anonymous server, btw: "git-daemon" implements anonymous 
access much more efficient than rsync/http. Sadly, kernel.org still 
doesn't offer it (but it's now used in the wild, ie I've done a couple of 
merges with people running the git daemon).

The _git_ network transport is. rsync and http aren't.
