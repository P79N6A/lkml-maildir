Subject: [PATCH] mm: data overlapping in page struct
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch is to fix a data overlapping issue in struct page. The
problem was introduced a few months ago by "split page table lock"
change in which mapping is moved into the same union with ptl. Since
private has fixed length (size of unsigned long), depending on config
options, ptl may have larger size than private. In this case, ptl will
overlap to mapping and may overwrite the original data in mapping. 
The simplest way of fixing this is to move mapping out of the union, as
in this patch. There may be better approaches; I'll leave it to the
experts more familiar with this part of code.  
We have discussed this with some of the Novell kernel engineers in the
CC list.
