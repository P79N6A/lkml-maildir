I think even this would fail if you are doing something clever with
NAT or other iptables stuff.  Probably we're going to have to put this
in the hands of the users..who hopefully can determine whether they
can allow LRO or not...
For GSO on output, is there a generic fallback for any driver that
does not specifically implement GSO?
Thanks,
Ben
