I don't wish to argue the KDE vs. Gnome merits. And gnome is to
the point that it shows very serious signs of promise.  And I have ALL
of the various office packages installed at this point (each has its
strengths and weaknesses; I'm not yet convinced I can take my big document
(the HTTP/1.1 spec) off of Word 98 quite yet, though I still have hopes).
I do note that in the computer stores I wander into, I see Red Hat
distributions in stacks, but not SuSE.
Given the market share RH has, probability theory says that most people
who pick up and install Linux right now will NOT have a superior user
interface experience.  I've got Win98 installed at home as well, and the
competition is far from trivial.
Ergo, it is premature to claim that Linux has one, in my book.  Hopefully
in 6 months, it won't be.  And there isn't anyone on the planet, with
the possible exception of Bob Scheifler, that will be happier than I
am when the bulk of Linux/UNIX shipments finally have a competant GUI
shipping.
