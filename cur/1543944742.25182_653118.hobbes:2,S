Yes it may require a separate connection between both sides where a 
kind of VM notification protocol is established to tear these things down and 
set them up again. That is if there is nothing in the RDMA protocol that
allows a notification to the other side that the mapping is being down 
down.

s/switch/translate I guess. That is good and those page tables could be 
used for the notification scheme to enable reclaim. But they are optional 
and are maintaining the driver state. The linearization could be 
reconstructed from the kernel page tables on demand.

Well the mapping would have to be on demand to avoid the issues that we 
currently have with pinning. The user API could stay the same. If the 
driver tracks the mappings using the notifier then the VM can make sure 
that the right things happen on exit etc etc.

So the driver software can tear down and establish page tables 
entries at will? I do not see the problem. The RDMA hardware is one thing, 
the way things are visible to the user another. If the driver can 
establish and remove mappings as needed via RDMA then the user can have 
the illusion of persistent RDMA memory. This is the same as virtual memory 
providing the illusion of a process having lots of memory all for itself.

Well yes of course. What is proposed here is an additional notification 
mechanism (could even be via tcp/udp to simplify things) that would manage 
the mappings at a higher level. The writes would not occur if the mapping 
has not been established.

Of course. You need to create an additional communication layer to get 
that.

True maybe you cannot do this by simply staying within the protocol bounds 
of RDMA that is based on page pinning if the RDMA protocol does not 
support a notification to the other side that the mapping is going away. 
If RDMA cannot do this then you would need additional ways of notifying 
the remote side that pages/mappings are invalidated.
