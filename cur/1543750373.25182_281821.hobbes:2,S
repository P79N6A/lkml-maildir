Eventually probably but libata's PATA support is pretty pathetic right
now, it doesn't know anything about PATA drive errata. I did look at it
and when it grows up into a real IDE layer for PATA I'm all for moving
*every* IDE driver to it because some of the IDE error path corner cases
are almost rewrite level fixes (eg DMA changedown, timer/interrupt CD
race oops)

Ok - I agree entirely about that one.

Will look at that.

Can move that

That will be fine.

Disagree. It says "e.g."

I'm not sure of the best way to do that cleanly. What do you have in
mind ?

The alternative is to stick a command filter into the IDE core in
various places. I'd rather hide the uglies in the driver having played
with ->taskfile hooks in 2.6.9-ac. That keeps the uglies where they
belong but isn't nice to retrofit to the IDE core (unlike libata)

Thanks. I'll go and polish these up.
