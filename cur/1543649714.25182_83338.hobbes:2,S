Interesting. You copy data with 1,549 megabytes per second over a 800 
megabytes per second frond side bus, into (probably) PC100 memory, i.e. 
theoretical bandwidth of 800 megabytes/sec.
You probably operate within the L2 cache.
Roy, which type of memory and which chipset do you use?
The csum/copy speed is 210 MByte/sec: 13% cpu time needed for 225 
mbit/sec. That could be correct, if you use SDRAM and everything is 
cache-cold (source dma from disk, dest previously used as a network 
buffer, dma from nic)
