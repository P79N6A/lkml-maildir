Sure.
I'm re-basing my test branch right now and can exclude this one
since it is in x86.git. (and yes, I'm interested in unifying mpparse_*.c some day)
yes, your understanding is correct -- this is not urgent 2.6.24 material,
it is just a 'regular patch':-)
Re: making the VIA part into dead-code
I had avoided that originally because I was going to nominate
this patch for the highest check-in-comment length/code-change ratio
But once I went over 1 line I blew the budget;-)
Eric,
What do you suggest we do with NR_IRQS on i386 so that we
can delete the compression code entirely?
thanks,
