Hi David,
Another related point that may also need to be considered is that I think 
I am correct in saying that on ARM and on the 64bit platforms, sizeof 
(unsigned long long) is 16 (128bits).
Should the RedZone words be specified as __u64 not the unsigned long long 
used or does the alignment need to be that of unsigned long long ?
Regards
 	Mark Fortescue.
