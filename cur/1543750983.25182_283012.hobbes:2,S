So how do some distro makers manage to stabilize their 'enterprise' versions,
stay on a 2.4.21 with hundreds of patches which overall seem to work pretty
well ? The distro maker I think about has quite a big crunch of the kernel
developpers, and I suspect that they do this work themselves. If they can
refrain from putting new features everyday in their employer's product, why
can't they do the same for the free version ?
Other example: look how Alan releases kernels. He posts several updates a week,
some with very few changes, some with more, but at least, people can say "this
one works for me" and stick to it for a time. Indeed, I think that if 2.6.11
would stay a year in -rc version, then Alan would release tens of 2.6.10
derivatives which would then become far more stable than what the next 2.6.11
would be.
Today, coverage is done by users who are confident in one product and agree to
test it. The best reputation the tree gets, the more users will try it, and
the more covered it will be, then the best reputation it will get, etc...
