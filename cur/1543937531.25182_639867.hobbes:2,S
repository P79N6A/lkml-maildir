Hmmm - not sure whats happening here.  I wonder if we're stuck in an
interrupt storm of some sort as soon as you register the interrupt handler.
But I would think that whatever was causing the interrupt storm would be
running well before we hit setup_irq(), and you would be recording "nobody
cared" interrupts left and right.
The thing that scares me is that the TinyBIOS seems to know that we want
to use the MFGPT timers, and I wonder if they did anything behind the scenes
to "help us out" even though we didn't ask for it.
I don't know how easy it would be for you - but can you try reading 
MSRs 0x51400020 - 0x51400023?   If you need a command line app to do it,
you can use rdmsr from here:

Coming soon.
