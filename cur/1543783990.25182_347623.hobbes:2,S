There might be a bug with the ioremap patch that got in by the time
linux-2.6.13 was released. The intelfb maintainer is still working on it.
You can try to revert that patch (just make sure that the graphics
aperture in the BIOS is set to <= 128MB) or use vesafb for now.
Here's the link to that patch:
