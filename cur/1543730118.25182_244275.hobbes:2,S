Right. It's just something to consider if you aim for inclusion in
the mainline tree later.

Adding a syscall should roughly work like this:
- write your sys_foo() function
- add your syscall number to include/asm-i386/unistd.h, don't forget
  to change the "#define NR_syscalls" accordingly
- add ".long sys_foo" to sys_call_table in arch/i386/kernel/entry.S,
  in the right place (i.e. syscall 290 would need to be element 290
  in the list)
- arrange for the object file with sys_foo in it to be linked into
  the kernel
You're right, your going to have to touch a couple of files for
this approach.

I don't think the timespecs will be a problem. However, the char
pointer will have different sizes and alignment requirements on
32bit and 64bit system. I'm no expert in how that can be handled
in the compat layer, though.
