Subject: [BK SUMMARY] Remove NGROUPS hardlimit (resend w/o qsort)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
This patchset removes the hard NGROUPS limit.  It has been in use in a similar
form on our systems for some time.
There is a small change needed for glibc, and I will send that patch to the
glibc people if/when this gets pulled.
Unlike prior versions of this patch, I have changed qsort() to a simple
non-recursive sort.  Several people indicated that this change would solve
their objections.
Lastly, this does not fixup all the architectures.  I have other patchsets for
that, which need to be reviewed by arch maintainers.
Tim

   fix usage of NGROUPS in nfsd and svcauth
<thockin@freakshow.cobalt.com> (02/11/11 1.854)
   Remove the limit of 32 groups.  We now have a per-task, dynamic array of
   groups, which is kept sorted and refcounted.
   
   This ChangeSet incorporates all the core functionality. but does not fixup
   all the incorrect usages of groups.  That is in a seperate ChangeSet.
