Hi,
Could I request about something ???
In Poland in last few days we have a very hard
conversation about radeonfb. Some people have
a huge problem with that. They can force radeonfb
to work, but they cannot change display timings.
Using fbset cause monitor to turn off.
We know that the answer is in Alans Cox kernel 2.4.20-rc2-ac3.
Could I request to include some solution to the
new kernel 2.4.21 or something like that ????
I hope my terrible english will not provoke You
to forget about this e-mail.
				Krystian
