Odd, the idea (which I think is clear) is that min_vruntime can wrap
around the u64 spectrum. And by using min_vruntime as offset to base
the key around, we get a signed but limited range key-space. (because
we update min_vruntime to be the leftmost task (in a monotonic fashion))
So I'm having trouble with these patches, that is, both your wrap
around condition of:
  if (likely(new_rq->cfs.min_vruntime))
as well as the last patchlet:
  if (((s64)vruntime > (s64)min_vruntime) ||
in that neither of these changes make sense in what its trying to do.
Its perfectly valid for min_vruntime to exist in 1ULL << 63.
