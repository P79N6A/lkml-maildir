Yes. We also saw a case, where the RTO was quite high but not quite 120,
so we got exactly one retransmission.

Sorry, I'm not really trying to debug Linux so I haven't given it much
thought. We're exercising retransmission algorithms with a packet loss
ratio of 5% if that's any help.

It's ARM in little endian mode.

Heh, they're not bogus, just differently aligned. :) This is an
implementation where packet processing latency is not highest 
item on the list of optimization targets.
Now that you mention it, tcp_parse_options() in input.c seems to expect
that the timestamps are word aligned, which is not the case here, and a
false assumption in any case. I would have expected a bus error for
that, unless the pointer cast generates code that magically word aligns
the resulting pointer...
