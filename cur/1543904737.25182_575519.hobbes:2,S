Subject: [PATCH] Don't needlessly dirty mlocked pages when initially faulting them in.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/26/457

make_pages_present() is dirtying mlocked pages if the VMA is writable, even
though it shouldn't, by telling get_user_pages() to simulate a write fault.
A simple way to test this is to mlock a multi-GB file, and then sync.
The sync will take a long time.
As far as I can see, it should be safe to just not simulate a write fault.
