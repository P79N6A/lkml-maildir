Davide,
I really cannot think of a good reason why eventpoll_init() should print
a pointer value to user-space - especially the value of current?
I do not think this is good practice and someone might even consider it
a security hole.  Personally, I would prefer to remove the "successfully
initialized" message altogether, but at the very least can we not print
current's address?
