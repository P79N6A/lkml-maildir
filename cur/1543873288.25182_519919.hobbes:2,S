Fsck it, Johann :)
It is a trend (a politics) to hide head into the sand and feel like
nothing happend - open source does not have mechanisms to force people
to do something (like comment on foreign ideas/implementations), 
so people make a look like problem does not exist and solve it using own way.
There will be tons of other interesting stuff, stay tuned :)
