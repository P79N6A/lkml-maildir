Your config is not identical to the one I sent. If you want to find out what the problem is, you must first try to produce a setup that is known good. So simply use my config, even if it contains stuff you don't need, and especially if it does not contain stuff you want.
Your primary goal is: let the box boot.
Your secondary goal is: add your original options to my config one by one - means: add one, test it, add next.
Somewhere in between it is expected to break. Then you probably located the reason with the last option you added.

I have several of those boards in production environment, one of those is exactly like yours (1GB RAM and 2 x PIII(933)). All of them work flawlessly. There is a chance it is related to my configs.
