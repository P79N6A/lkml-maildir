Well, I really like Keith's kbuild25 too, but Linus said (at least once) 
he wanted an evolution to a new build system... not an unreasonable 
request to at least consider.  Despite Keith's quality of code (again -- 
I like kbuild25), his 3 patch submissions seemed a lot like ultimatums, 
very "take it or leave it dammit".  Not the best way to win friends and 
influence people.
If Keith is indeed leaving it, I'm hoping someone will maintain it, or 
work with Kai to integrate it into 2.5.x.
