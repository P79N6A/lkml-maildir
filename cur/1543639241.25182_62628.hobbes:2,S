Because I can not get a FSCKING PATCH past any of the Lead Penquins.
/src/linux-2.5.4-pristine/drivers/ide/ide-pci.c
#ifdef CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
        {DEVID_PDC20265,"PDC20265",     PCI_PDC202XX,   ATA66_PDC202XX,
INIT_PDC202XX,  NULL,           {{0x00,0x00,0x00}, {0x00,0x00,0x00}},
ON_BOARD,
48 },
#else /* !CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE */
        {DEVID_PDC20265,"PDC20265",     PCI_PDC202XX,   ATA66_PDC202XX,
INIT_PDC202XX,  NULL,           {{0x50,0x02,0x02}, {0x50,0x04,0x04}},
OFF_BOARD,
48 },
#endif
But since there is the option to compile off-board as bootable, it is a
noop.  I have not been able to directly add code or update any kernel
first hand since the change in 2.5.3 and my exit of Linux Development at
2.5.5.  So I really don't give a damn.
But what I do know is people bug me for patches and updates and ask me to
fix 2.5.XX on a regular bases.  Nobody takes my patches but man when crap
hits the fan they come running for me to put it right again.
Cheers,
