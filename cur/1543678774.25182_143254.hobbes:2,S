Christoph, while I agree with you, I also see why a lot of people just
symlink /usr/include/linux to /usr/src/.../include/linux.  Pure
convenience and the lack of a dedicated collection of userspace
headers outside a distributions scope.
Seperating userspace headers from kernel headers would also be a good
thing, as the #ifdef __KERNEL__ #else #endif orgy could finally be
reduced a bit.
Since these headers do depend on the kernel version and should be the
official interface between kernel and userspace, maintaining them
inside the kernel tree would also, imho, be a Good Thing.
So imnsho the "don't use the kernel headers" comment I read on a
common basis is not a very helpful advice, as long as we are missing
in this respect.
Or did I miss something important and just exposed my stupidity?
