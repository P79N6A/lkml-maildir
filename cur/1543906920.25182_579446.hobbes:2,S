just to quote from this same email thread:
| I too use mutt and noatime,nodiratime everywhere (same 10 year-old 
| thinko), and the only side effect is that when I have a new mail, it 
| is reported in all of my xterms until I read it, clearly something I 
| can live with (and sometimes it's even desirable).

| In fact, mutt is pretty good at this. It updates atime and ctime 
| itself as soon as it opens the mbox, so the shell is happy and only 
| reports "you have mail" afterwards.
