Assuming the driver-loading parts of the kdump kernel's initrd are the
same (udev, bunch of modules, firmwares, etc) as the regular kernel's
initrd, this shouldn't be a problem.
In the specific case of aic94xx, one needs request_firmware() and
associated infrastructure to load firmware blobs into the controller in
order to issue any I/O at all.

Hmm... could we use such a sysfs attribute to reassign adapter WWNs at
arbitrary times?  Is that even a good idea?
