Hi Chris
Never had the trashed fonts before.
How about a better comparison of systems?
All I mentioned were r128, ne2k, PIIX4 and SMP,  barely enough to claim similar
hardware thus these aren't real problems cause you don't see them.
I can send you gory details if your interested.
My reason for claiming these are problems, maybe not show stoppers, are:
This system is rock solid on 2.2.X.
problem 1, shouldn't fail on 2.4 if it works just fine on 2.2.  Probably a locking
issue but I'm not sure.  Any idea where to put some BKL's to see if the problem
will go away?
problem 2, happens randomly, so is it a hardware problem or a software issue?  being
that the system works fine SMP and UP then my guess is a software interaction when
UP-APIC is enabled, a race condition??
problem 3, new feature in 2.4, one would expect, hey, I've got this hdwr in my system,
let me enable this option...  wait a minute the system doesn't boot...
problem 4, ISAPNP in the kernel is new for 2.4, i was pointing out that it can be
improved to make it better able to select IRQ's that work so that the user can just
upgrade to 2.4 without having to tweak the BIOS and/or the code.  I sent a patch to
Linus but he rejected it, yes I realize it was a weak attempt but it fixed my ISAPNP
problems, and no one has proposed a better solution.  Shouldn't the
first release of 2.4.0 show that it's new capabilities are ready for prime time?
Thanks,
Martin
