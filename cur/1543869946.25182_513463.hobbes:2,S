I'm still seeing lots of warnings about unchecked return codes from
driver model functions.
These must have been around for at least three months, if not longer,
and there seems to be very little progress towards resolving them.
Maybe if no one cares about fixing the warnings, we shouldn't have
the warnings at all since they're just mere noise.
Can we resolve to either fix the warnings, or remove the ineffective
__must_check annotations?
