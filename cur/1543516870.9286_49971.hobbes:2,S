What's the performance of these cards? And which ADSL modems are they
compatible with?
I certainly like this idea: I'm not happy that I have to give up a
couple of IP addresses just so I can stick a firewall between my ADSL
modem and my internal LAN. If the ADSL card can be configured as just
another network interface, that would be so much cleaner.
