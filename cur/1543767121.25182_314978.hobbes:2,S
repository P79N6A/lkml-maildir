Je, je, you're dreaming. The limit on pendrives, flash mp3 players and so
on is the flash memory read/write speed. You are lucky if you get 1Mb/s.
So for a flash based device, dont ever worry about if it is USB 1.1 or 2.0.
Things are different if you have a disk based device (iPod, iPod mini).
A disk is a disk.
The difference in total time should be minimal between sync and async mounts,
if you take into account filesystem sync/umount time.
Anyways, your 40 Kb/sec seem too sloow. But dont expect your 19Mb/s, only
about 1Mb/s (reading, writing thigs drop to 600Kb/s).
