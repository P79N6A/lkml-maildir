This idiomatic phrase suggests to me that it applies when ram is >= 1Gb 
and <= 4Gb.  The fact that we interpret it differently indicates that it 
could be more clearly stated.  If your interpretation is correct, then 
what would this mean when a machine had 3.5Gb of ram installed?

Ok, so it appears that this one is wrong also.  If someone could explain 
the rules that apply, I would be happy to prepare a patch to the Kconfig 
script.  I don't consider myself to be completely stupid, and if the 
help text was a bit more clear I wouldn't be asking these questions.  
I'm sure that other pilgrims will follow along later with the same 
questions.
