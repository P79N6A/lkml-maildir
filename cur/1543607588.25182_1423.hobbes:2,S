OK, my bad.  At least the random variable-name cleanups let you SEE where
we are supposed to be using word sizes and byte sizes.  Even you were
confused about it ;-)

The patch looks correct, though.

Well, this is a matter of taste.  With my code, it is correct regardless
of how tmp is declared, while with your code you assume tmp is TMP_BUF_SIZE
words, and that it is declared with a 4-byte type.  Both ways are resolved
at compile time, so using "sizeof(tmp)/4" or "sizeof(tmp)*8" doesn't add
any run-time overhead.
I don't have a strong opinion either way, if Linus and/or Alan have a
preference to do it one way or the other.
Cheers, Andreas
