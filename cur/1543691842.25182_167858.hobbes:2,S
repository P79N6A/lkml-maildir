Hello all,
I took root@chaos.analogic.com off the linux-kernel list
for a few days so I can trap the spammers and write their
addresses to `ipchains`. I have been getting approximately
12,000 email messages per day on that system, making it
impossible to use. It's all about the servers spreading
the M$ email virus with the phony message to update to the
latest security patches, plus a few hundred "penis-patch" spam
messages per hour.
Anyway, I am trying to fight back. I have attached a
tar-file which contains the source-code I use to create
anti-spam entries for `ipchains`. It also automatically
ties up the spammers and sends them an email message
asking them to stop, plus it logs the connections.
Cheers,
Richard B. Johnson
