I just compiled glibc 2.2.1 against the 2.4.0 kernel headers today.  I
went to the local console to login.  I was expecting to go get a coffee
after typing my password, but was pleasantly surprised to see the prompt
waiting for me in no time at all.
So the newest glibc seems to have the problem fixed for me now.
