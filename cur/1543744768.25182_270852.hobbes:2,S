I don't think that is a valid argument.
If uClinux wants to be a different source-base, then go wild. But if you 
want to integrate into the standard kernel, there are other priorities. 
One of them is that it has to integrate cleanly. And that means that we 
don't do micro-optimizations that make the non-MMU case affect mainline 
code unless there is a damn good reason.
