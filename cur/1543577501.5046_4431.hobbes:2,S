As well as this, it might be worthwhile to complain to these
sites. Otherwise if everyone just turns off ECN then those sites which
block it will probably not fix their problem and ECN will not gain
"public" acceptance. It would be great pity if this were to happen as
ECN has the potential (if widely supported) to greatly reduce network
congestion and bandwidth "waste".
Would it perhaps be possible to have ECN enabled but use something
such as IPTables to unset it when connecting to those sites which
reject ECN connections? So that you could define a rule something like
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --syn -d 1.2.3.4 -j unsetecn
