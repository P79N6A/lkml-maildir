Huh? IV == 4. XV == 15.
I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000...
Unless you translate the signs one by one. But that's not the correct
way to do it. In that case, Pentium III would have the modelcode
0x0111...
Then again, we all know that Intel has made processors in the past that
couldn't count, so I guess it's possible that they screwed up this time
too :^)
