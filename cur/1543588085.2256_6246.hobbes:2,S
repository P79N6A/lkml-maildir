Ok, I see. I didn't understand that the functions you were talking about

Right. However, rare are the drivers that don't need at least to know
that a power management sequence is going on. All bus mastering drivers,
at least, must stop bus mastering (and clearing the bit in the command
register is not enough on a bunch of them). Most drivers have to cleanly
stop ongoing operations, refuse (or block) requests while the driver is
sleeping, etc... and finally configure things back once waking up. I
don't see much cases where a simple "default" function would work. 
My current scheme on powerbook don't do half of that... it still sorta
works since I manage to stop all scheduling and shut things down in the
proper order, but it's neither a clean nor a safe way to do things.

Ok, agree with that one.
I sill consider, however, that the current suspend/resume callbacks in
the pci_dev structure are not the best way to do things. I would have
really prefered that each pci_dev embed a pm notifier structure. In some
cases, we want to pass more than simple suspend/resume messages (suspend
request, suspend now, suspend cancel, and resume are the 4 messages I use
on powerbooks). 
Also, this can be generalized to other type of drivers (USB, IEEE1394,
..), eventually passing bus-specific messages
