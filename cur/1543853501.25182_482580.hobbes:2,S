i386 and ppc64 still doing builds, but after an hour on x86_64,
an ld got stuck in a loop under ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv,
alternating between ext2_rsv_window_add and rsv_window_remove.
Send me a patch and I'll try it...
ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv+0x288
ext2_new_blocks+0x21e
ext2_get_blocks+0x398

__block_prepare_write+0x171

__generic_file_aio_write_nolock+0x4bc
