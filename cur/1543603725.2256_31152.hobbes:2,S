Yes, and it's also worth noting that this same NFS assumption will
break exports of _all_ filesystems which don't have simple static
inum/filehandle capabilities.  Reiserfs should work just fine now but
the same NFS problem is still present if you do other things such as
trying to re-export a SMB mount as NFS. 
Cheers,
 Stephen
