Hi Robin.
I combined them all in one patch wich caused lkml filter to eat it.
The patch now includes documentation on version of tools used.
You can see the patch here:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/sam/kbuild.git;a=commit;h=c40f56409d01f6f1ea80ed4c229096749c2335df
Since is is all auto-generated code I see no gain in splitting up the
code so it can be published on lkml.
