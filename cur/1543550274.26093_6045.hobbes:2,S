Two bugs.  Horst found one, which is easily fixed by exorcising all
quote marks and if statements:
  CC	=$(CROSS_COMPILE)$(shell which gcc272 2>/dev/null || \
           which kgcc 2>/dev/null || echo gcc) -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
There is one bug left though.  `which` gives an absolute path so
$(CROSS_COMPILE) is now useless.  Try this instead:
  CC	=$(shell if [ -n "$(CROSS_COMPILE)" ]; then echo $(CROSS_COMPILE)cc; else \
           which gcc272 2>/dev/null || which kgcc 2>/dev/null || echo cc; fi) \
           -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)/include
Note that we still win on punctuation and length.....
