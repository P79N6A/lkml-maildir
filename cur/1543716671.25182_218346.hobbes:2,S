Didn't you get the next patch, rmap 23?  That does the other arches.

I was very tempted to do so, but it's not the style for flush_dcache_page
& friends, so I updated each asm/cacheflush.h (well, sh goes down a level).

Not really: there's an extra level at the bottom for two of the arches.
Documented with the rest in filemap.c (though I didn't commit to which
arches there).

I most certainly agree it isn't pretty, I'd gladly solve it a
better way - if you or someone else can tell me that better way.
Obviously we could add another spinlock rather than reusing tree_lock,
but I don't think that'll help much: still regrettable.

A sixth sense tells me that we don't want to disable interrupts
throughout vmtruncate's unmapping of pages from vmas...
But perhaps there's another way of looking at the problem.
