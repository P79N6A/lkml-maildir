The two cards in question (the working and not working) have the following
entries in /proc/pci:
ATI XPERT@WORK 4MB, PCI; Intel HX based motherboard
Does work with both 2.2.12 and 2.2.5/RedHat.
Bus  0, device   9, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: ATI Mach64 GP (Rage Pro) (rev 92).
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 12.
		Master Capable.  Latency=30.  Min Gnt=8.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe7000000 [0xe7000008].
      I/O at 0xe000 [0xe001].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe6000000 [0xe6000000].
ATI XPERT@WORK 8 MB AGP; Via Apollo based motherboard
Does not work with 2.2.12. Does work well with 2.2.5/RedHat.
  Bus  1, device   0, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: ATI Mach64 GB (rev 92).
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.
		Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=8.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000 [0xe0000000].
      I/O at 0xc000 [0xc001].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe2000000 [0xe2000000].
I would like to point out once more that the second (AGP) card worked well
in 2.2.5/RedHat. The support appears to be broken somewhere between 2.25
and 2.2.11.
