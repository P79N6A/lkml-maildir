The superblock is pinned by the kernel in buffercache while you fsck a
ro mounted ext2, so I must somehow uptodate this superblock in the
buffercache before collecting away the pagecache containing more recent
info from fsck. It's all done lazily, I just thought not to break the
assumption that an idling buffercache will never become not uptodate
under you anytime because it seems not too painful to implement compared
to changing the fs, it puts the check in a slow path and it doesn't
break the API with the buffercache (so I don't need to change all the fs
to check if the superblock is still uptodate before marking it dirty).
