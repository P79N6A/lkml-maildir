I've been down the road of trying to fix that code as well a while back.
Although my patches had flaws and didn't go in, perhaps your current
attempt could bennefit by looking at what I tried to do back then and
the feedback I recieved, so I thought I'd point them out to you.
Take a look at the two threads named "[PATCH] ide-tape: attempt to
handle copy_*_user() failures" and "[PATCH] ide-tape: attempt to
handle copy_*_user() failures [take two]"
Here's a link to them in the archives :
