I think part of this confusion was the little flamewar over naming.   
I think I can provide a succinct and simple description of this  
stuff, possibly as the start of some documentation:
In this patch there are two ways of setting up code to run at some  
point in the future: timers and timeouts.
A timeout (like waiting for somebody to answer the phone) is  
optimized to never happen (they will hopefully pick up first).  If  
everything works perfectly; it will be stopped before it has a chance  
to go off.
A timer (like a kitchen timer telling you the cookies are done) is  
optimized to be added and sit around until it expires.  You just  
don't turn off the timer and take the cookies out before they are done.
For the most part, you don't really care much about accuracy with a  
timeout.  It needs to happen no earlier than the specified time, but  
if it occurs a second late, so what?  The person might sit around  
waiting an extra few seconds for their friend to pick up, but that's  
not a major issue.  On the other hand, you really *do* care about how  
accurate your timer is.  If you wait an extra minute or two after the  
timer goes off before pulling the cookies from the oven, you have  
some rather inedible cookies.

I think that this is a relatively useful distinction to make, and  
perhaps we _should_ rename the subsystem and educate developers about  
the difference between timers and timeouts.

Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by  
definition, not smart enough to debug it.
