That problem came about mostly because the definition was not
part of the original interface definition.  Not unlike DMA
addressing ... for the longest time it was impossible to
report DMA mapping failures.
Whereas there's *never* been any question about whether
negative numbers are invalid GPIO numbers.  (They aren't.)

Inertia is one of the problems there ... plus, the only
obvious advantage of "#define NO_IRQ 0" is that it makes
it easier to be lazy about initialization.
Plus, changing platforms to use that convention means they
mostly need to adopt an *unnatural* step of mapping from the
hardware IRQ numbers (which often start at zero, as they do
on one system I just ssh'd into) to some "logical" ID.
Even if you believe that's worthwhile, it's work; and it
could easily break something.

Neither of those is an "accessor".  One is a "predicate"; and
the other is an "initializer".  (A better initializer name might
be more like INIT_GPIO_INVALID.)
The "accessor" scenario is actually a natural place to rely
on errno values.  Accessors are like
	int gpio = foo_get_gpio(foo_ptr);
And the normal kernel convention there is to return negative
errno values that characterize the different fault modes.
(Ditto allocators:  foo_alloc_gpio etc.)

Which most code already does.  And you'd certainly want to
do that if you were using an accessor to get GPIOs...

It's not a GPIO number though; it's specifically designated as
NOT being a GPIO.  So why not have it be a magic number which
has meaning in multiple contexts?  Do you object to "ssize_t",
or in general the "return negative errno on fault" conventions?

I don't see any reason to change the API to disallow using
other negative values there.  What good would come from that?
(Remember, the *CURRENT* definition covers this situation
by saying no negative number is a valid GPIO number.)
At the machine instruction level, comparing against "-1" or
any other single currently-defined-as-invalid number is more
expensive than checking "is it negative".
And at a higher level, you'd prevent normal accessor (or
allocator, etc) idioms.  I can't see any value to preventing
such usage.

It's currently simple and well defined; negative numbers
are not GPIOs.  You want a *different* model, which is in
fact more complex ... it adds that "undefined" notion.

They can already pick any positive number.  I don't know
about you, but I *shudder* to think of anyone who's
seriously trying to manage more than 2 Gbits of GPIOs
one bit at a time!

Well, you've not convinced me there's any reason to change
the current rules to prevent accessor/allocator idioms from
returning fault codes that could be meaningful.
