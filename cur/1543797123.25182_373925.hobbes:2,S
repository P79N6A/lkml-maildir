As with any good set of kernel changes, this is step one.  Step two will
include calling something _other_ than task_pid().  But, in the
interests of small, incremental changes, this is what we decided to do
first.

Exactly.  The next phase will focus on such places.  Hubertus has some
stuff working that's probably not ready for LKML, but could certainly be
shared.

I preferred to keep the number of patches at 13, rather than 130.  Those
are in the pipeline, but pids are the most important first step which
gets the most functionality.

This isn't excatly a new feature, nor does it add any appreciable code
or complexity.  I'm not sure that test even applies.

I agree.  I'm trying to figure out which way is best to go about this.
I have the feeling that using sparse tags like __user and __kernel is
the way to go, but we might also want to take the embedded struct
approach like atomic_t.

They don't, and thankfully there is anybody asking for it.  It adds
loads of complexity, and nobody apparently needs it.

For our application, yes.  For vserver, maybe not.  We'd like things
like 'top' to still work like normal, even though there are processes in
their own pidspace around.

I've never dealt with signal enough from userspace to give you a good
answer.  Can you explain the mechanics of how you would go about doing
this?

The pids coming out of system calls are always in the context of the
process doing the call.

I'm working on it :)
Right now, there's basically a hack in d_hash() to get new dentries for
each pidspace.  It is horrible and causes a 50x decrease in performance
on some benchmarks like dbench.
I think the long-term solution is to make multiple, independent proc
mounts, and give each pidspace a separate filesystem view.  That
requires some of the nifty new bind mount functionality and a chroot
when a new pidspace is created, but I think it works.

Lots of good questions.  I think we need to take some of our initial,
private discussions and get them out on an open list somewhere.  Any
suggestions?  I hate creating new sourceforge projects :)
