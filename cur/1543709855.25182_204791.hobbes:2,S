hi there,
is anyone able to use firewire hds (mine is a notebook-ide-drive, 40gb, in 
real life) with kernel 2.6.3?
my syslog always complains:
> ieee1394: ConfigROM quadlet transaction error for node 00:1023 
if you google for this line, you find loads of posters having the same 
problem, but no one has provided them any answers.
thus, i wonder, if all the other ide firewire drives on this nice planet are 
working fine under 2.6.x ...
BTW: mine is with working fine under kernel 2.4.xx, but i tend to be 
progressive (i.e. 2.6.x-ish)
any ideas?
