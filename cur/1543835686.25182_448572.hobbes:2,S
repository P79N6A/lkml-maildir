Well, if autodetection is removed, what is then the preferred
way of booting off a raid-1 device?
Kernel parameters?
An initrd with mdadm just for this?  Some people want to do even
partition detection from initrd, in order to have a smaller
kernel.  We aren't there yet though.
Autotetect is nice from an administrator viewpoint - compile
it in and it "just works".  The trouble when you connect
an array from some other machine is to be expected, but 
that isn't exactly everyday stuff.
