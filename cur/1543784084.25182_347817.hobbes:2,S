Hummm...Please see below. Nothing has changed since then, any idea why
its not acceptable now?

This really doesnt affect me, it just bothers me to go over inefficient code.
send_IPI_mask_sequence() does unicast IPI's. When number of CPUs is <=8
the mask version acheives the same with just one write, so its a selective
broadcast which is more efficient. 
Based on our earlier exchange i assumed it was clear and apparent which is
why you  "OK"ed the version when it was submitted to -mm. 
Nothing has changed, its the exact same patch. Hope its clear now.
Entirely up to you... :-(
