Your ATA drive can't tell you kernel what to do. I've seen some nice
modules that do very nasty things to your system, and I was suprised that
it was even possible.
For my own system : I don't care. But I can imagine that there are people
out there that do care about these kind of issues.

The car I drive most is a Mini cooper without firmware :)
