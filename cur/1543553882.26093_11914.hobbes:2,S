Irrelevant.  Remember that persistent module data is only set when the
module is loaded and retrieved when it removed.  Atomicity and speed
are not an issue at those points.

The userspace utilities are insmod and rmmod.  No, I am not going to
put version numbers into the saved data.

All of which are system level tuning parameters that vary based on time
and/or load.  My MVS sysprog hat says that there is no point in saving
these parameters across a reboot.  Instead you have global targets
which rarely change and let the system tue to meet the targets - like
MVS Work Load Manager.  These settings are nothing to do with modules.

And what is the point of saving those parameters?  Firstly they will
not be implemented via modules.  Secondly the values just before
shutdown and at startup will not be useful for the peak hour load, nor
for the overnight backup window.  Again, set targets and let the system
auto tune.  The only thing you save are the overall targets, those are
already in text files with their own specific format.
