I have a Dell Inspiron 8200. Like the Latitude of the OP, it has the
DualPoint ALPS and a PS/2 port, so I can help testing, if needed.
I can also get my hands on a 4-button Logitech Trackball (no
scrollwheels or anything, just four buttons), if it can help the
testing.

One thing that I noticed under 'the other OS' is that, when an
external PS/2 device is inserted and then disconnected, the 'internal'
ones (keyboard, touchpad) seem to lose sync. It has been some time
since I tried it the last time, so I should probably check again to
see if the extended protocols do work, somehow.
