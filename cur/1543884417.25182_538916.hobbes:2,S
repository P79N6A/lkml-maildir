A reasonable point, although if you don't happen to sleep in the allocations
I suspect time wise it's pretty much a wash.
I have some other reasons I might need the capability of clone a thread
from a non-parent process, and it has the potential to simplify some things
in the kthread case so I'm going to finish investigating, since I believe
I have figured out a path to that target.
