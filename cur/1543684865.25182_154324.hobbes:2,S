Can only agree. Wine/wineserver now has the same PRI as in pure A3 on my
game-test, which can be felt and seen. Playability = 8.75 due to there
being slightly more bumps and audio glitches than in A3.
But that (A3) scheduler had other issues. Came home from work and began
typing in an xterm that had been sitting on the screen for more than 8
hours. It woke up... slowly. Took about 3 or 4 seconds before it
accepted my keystrokes without delays. It was not swapped out, but more
like it slowly accelerated from standstill.
Will report faults if I find them. Otherwise will stay silent. No news
is good news, you know.
