Greetings all; Slightly offtopic but maybe I can find some info here.
I have a requirement to format and use a floppy, either mechanical 
size, 256 byte sector, 18 sectors per track at 250kilobaud data rate.  
I have been assured that the "superio' chip on my mobo can indeed do 
that format.  Soooo...
I've added 4 more lines to the floppy definition array in floppy.c, 
and increased the array count at the top to match, but I don't seem 
to be able to get any output, its working as usual.  Stuck in 512 
bytes per sector modes, 9 to the track that is.
I even turned on several debugging options, but haven't found out 
where the logging is going if its working.  Looks like if its doing 
any debugging outputs, they're being sent to /dev/null.
Ideas?
Secondary problem too, I have a zombie of minicom that I can't kill.  
Its sleeping for disk access or some such twaddle.  It always trashes 
the X window cli screen I run it in, and often locks up like a piece 
of MS software from 1983.  Surely that thing has been cleaned up and 
'sane'itized for use with x somewhere along the line.  Or am I useing 
the wrong comm terminal utility in the first place?
