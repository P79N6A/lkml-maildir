Not sure I understand the problem exactly, but I believe ppc32 kernels 
do exactly what you want. Have a look at arch/ppc/boot/ld.script and 
see __{image,ramdisk,sysmap}_begin . Also see how e.g. 
arch/ppc/boot/prep/Makefile uses objcopy 
--add-section=.image=vmlinux.gz .
The end result is taking an arbitrary file and stuffing it into an ELF 
section, then using a linker script to provide the start and end 
addresses of the file data.
