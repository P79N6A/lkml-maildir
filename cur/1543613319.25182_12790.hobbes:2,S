Stewart, you can get Edward to create a new option for you by going to 
www.namesys.com/support.html
 $25 and you get a patch and all the additional support you need (sounds 
like you may need some for figuring out what version you have on the 
disk, etc.).
Or you might try what Ryan says, and save $25.
