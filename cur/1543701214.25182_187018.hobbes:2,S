Ah!, no problem at all. I'm used to hit "List Reply" on Mutt (and Mutt
relies on Mail-Followup-To: header, 
http://cr.yp.to/proto/replyto.html
).
I will take note on your advice.
Hope you don't mind I'm sending a copy to the lkml so that it's archived
in case it could be useful to someone (and hope the list does'nt mind
too).

Oh!, I didn't notice that part wasn't included in 2.4.23. Thanks for the
info.

OK, I see it.
I think I will do things just "by hand". I don't feel like having a
daemon messing with filesystems (it seems to mee quite far from the KISS
philosophy).
Btw, have you had reliability reports? Do you know if it's going to be
included in 2.6 "official" tree shortly?
