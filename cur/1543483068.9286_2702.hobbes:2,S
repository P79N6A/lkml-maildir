Let me guess, you both use RedHat-5.x? That's a problem of linuxconf.
When you run ifup the following command will be executed:
linuxconf --hint ipalias eth0
This command says that no ip aliasing is present, although it really is:
[root@planetzork /root]# ifconfig 
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:B4:32:4C:87  
          inet addr:195.37.122.246  Bcast:195.37.122.255  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:550313 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:1322933 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:939 txqueuelen:100 
          Interrupt:10 Base address:0x280 
eth0:0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:B4:32:4C:87  
          inet addr:192.168.1.1  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          Interrupt:10 Base address:0x280 
Try:
ifconfig eth0:0 ip1 ....
