Speaking of ac97_codec...
There's something fishy with the mixer range settings. Some settings work fine,
but others are only half the range they should be. This can be solved quite
easily, but I have not implemented it... yet. Again, if the original module
author (Ollie Lho from SiS, who is actively working on this module) wants to
solve this himself I'll stand by and watch. In the meantime I'll hack up a
patch and
send it.
Cheers//Frank
