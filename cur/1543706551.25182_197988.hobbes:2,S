Could you advise me how to make a dirty hack to get this going? Once 
again I am back to 2.6.1-rc1 kernel, which seems to be the last one 
stable for me. 2.6.3-rc1-mm1 locked up quite fast..
Perhaps it would also help to test the snapshots between rc1 and rc2 to 
find out which patch borked for me... I see 6 bk versions. Are these 
just incremental patches?
