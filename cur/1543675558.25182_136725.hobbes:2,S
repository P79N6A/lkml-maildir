Well, since I'm currently working on the zlib anyway...

Sounds nice.  Did I miss it on lkml, or haven't you made it public
yet?

The allocaters could be useful when lots of zlibs are fighting over
scarce memory, at least when operating in userspace.  K&R and
indentation seem to be personal style (inflate and deflate also have a
different style, when you look closely).  FAR, uInt and friends should
be portability wrappers, there was even a turboc bugfix in the code
before 1.1.4.
Who knows, the performance might even slightly improve after shaving
off some of the useless wrappers.
