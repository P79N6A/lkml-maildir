New guy to this list. Long time lurker on CKRM - decided to test the
control groups patches.
Pulled 2.6.24.rc4 patch and migrated my (working) 2.6.23-rc4 config.
Panic'd because of NFS root not found - not too surprising as I don't
have one.
Any ideas why this option comes up selected ???. Same result if I "make
oldconfig" or "make menuconfig" (after "make mrproper" in both cases).
Maybe some weird combination of containers/cpusets/??? ...
What should I be looking for to troubleshoot ???.
