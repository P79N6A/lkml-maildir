Btw., has anyone yet *measured* maximum stack usage for some weeks on several 
machines, e.g. desktop system with one NIC, reiserfs; server with several 
NICs, stacked device-mapper targets, fiber channel, appletalk...; web server 
with SQL database running on it etc?
Right now I have the impression that the 4k stack flamewars base on make 
checkstack output, waiting for bugreports and other guesswork. Removing the 
safety net on such a basis is just *very bad engineering*.
