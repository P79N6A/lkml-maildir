Is this in reference to the irq-context clocksource polling stuff? I
don't see a dire reason to keep that code, and I agree removing that is
a certainly a worth while cleanup .. I added this cleanup to one of my
trees when you first suggested it , and there is some infrastructure
that really should be added to facilitate it.
