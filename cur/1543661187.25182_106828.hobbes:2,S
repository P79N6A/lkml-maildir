As someone said, parsing and string processing is one of the jobs in kernel
config. Kernel gurus decided to rewrite the thing in C to avoid the lacks
in the current bash-ish kconfig, because writing logic for dependencies,
checks and so on is a pain...so let's rewrite the logic handling, _and_ the
string processing, btw.
The easies way (from my point of view): write Perl::KConfig in C to do the logic
hard work and build the big thing in perl. That will be putting a perl
interface on top of klibc ?
