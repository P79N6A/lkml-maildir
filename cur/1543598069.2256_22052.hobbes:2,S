Conectiva has been shipping a patch to limit CPU usage
on a per-user basis in their 2.2 kernel RPM for quite
a while now.
Unfortunately I ran into problems with ksoftirqd while
porting the patch to 2.4 and have been tied up in the
memory management and other projects since.
Oh, the patch also doesn't have any effect on the scheduler
fast-path. Only the recalculation is changed...
regards,
Rik
