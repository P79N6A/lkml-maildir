    Hi all :)
    Linux Kernel 2.4.29, in a do-it-yourself linux box, equipped with
an AGP Voodoo 3 2000 card, tdfx framebuffer support. I boot in vga
mode 0x0f05, with parameter 'video=tdfx:800x600-32@100' and I get
(correctly) 100x37 character grid. All of that is correct. What is
not correct is the characters attributes, namely the 'blink'
attribute.
    If I use the tdfx framebuffer (I've tested some more
resolutions), I lose the blinking text (which I use, for example, for
marking my dangling symlinks in 'ls' or 'zsh'). Is this a bug, a
feature or just a mistake I'm consistently making?
    In addition to this, at boot time the background in the lines
around the cute penguin logo is white and not black as it should...
    Thanks a lot in advance. Feel free to ask for more details,
tests, etc.
