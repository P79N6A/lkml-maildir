Andi,
Looking a the exit_idle() code:
static void __exit_idle(void)
{
        if (read_pda(isidle) == 0)
                return;
        write_pda(isidle, 0);
        atomic_notifier_call_chain(&idle_notifier, IDLE_END, NULL);
}
I am wondering whether you are exposed to a race condition  w.r.t. to interrupts.
Supposed you are in idle, you get an interrupt and you execute __exit_idle(), the
test evaluate to false but before you can change the value of isidle, you get 
a higher priority interrupt which then also calls __exit_idle(), the test is still
false and you invoke the notifier, when you return from this interrupt you also
clear the isidle, but you call the notifier yet a second time.
I think that isidle needs to be test_and_clear atomically for this to guarantee
only one call the notifier on __exit_idle().
what do you think?
