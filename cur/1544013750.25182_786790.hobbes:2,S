I have a problem with this. The context of i_flags is to be used with
set_bit() and test_bit(). In some ARCHs like x86_64 they take an 
"unsigned long *" in most others they take a "void *" and cast internally
to a "u32 *". (for x86_64 I must use "unsigned long", anything else warns)
I think if I declare "unsigned long" but only use 32 bits flags then
I should be in the clear with ALL archs, I'll see if that works once
this code sits in linux-next. (That's real ugly I think)
Is set_bit() and test_bit() should only be used from arch/ code? What 
can regular kernel code use?
Thanks
