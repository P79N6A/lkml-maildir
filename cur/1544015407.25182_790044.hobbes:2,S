Unfortunately in the whole series ppp has been change more
then others and it's looks ugly indeed that is why it was RFC.
Namespaces imply isolation of data right? Including private
data being 'user related' -- ie units passed to user in one
namespace should not interfere with units passed to user in
another namespace. So if I will not 'bind' units pool to
namespaces it would be possible to steal unit from one namespace
proposed for another namespace. Right?
