Subject: [PATCH 0/4] VFAT cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
the following four mails contain patches for a basic cleanup of the
VFAT filename handling code. The intention is to get the (hopefully)
easy changes merged before I post more controversial ones. The patches
are against 2.6.10-rc1-bk18 and they are tested lightly.
Any comments are welcome.
Thanks,
René
