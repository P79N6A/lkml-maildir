Hi,
Do someone know how to add a system call for the kernel 2.4.8 ?
I did know how to do it for an older version (2.0.35) :
- add a line in the file : /usr/src/linux/include/asm/unistd.h
	#define __NR_my_systemcall	XXXX (where XXXX is the number for my new system call)
- modify the file /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S
	- add my system call 
		.long SYMBOL_NAME (my_systemcall) at the end of the system callslist
	- modify le last line of the file :
		.space (NR_syscalls-166)*4   <= replace the 166 by 167
After this changes, I only needed to recompile the kernel and reboot with it... and a user's program could use the new system call...
But with my new kernel, this manupilation doesn't still work.
