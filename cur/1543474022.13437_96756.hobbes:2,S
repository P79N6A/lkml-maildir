Hi Peter.

I have to query whether you've managed to get yourself a corrupted
source tree since I've been in all of those config areas on 2.2.0.pre1
through 2.2.0.pre3 and haven't seen anything resembling what you refer
to. Could you please check that?
Alternatively, as there appear to be several reports of various things
that appear to have a similar cause, is this a case of using an
incorrect patch sequence from whatever base kernel you started with,
or of patching a modified kernel rather than the raw one?
In my case, I downloaded the raw 2.2.0.pre1 kernel as a bz2 tarball,
and have patched up from it via pre2 and pre3 to date. I'll be
downloading the pre4 patch shortly, and applying it to my tree, so
will report any changes therein...
Best wishes from Riley.
