Found it.  ACPI 3.0b, page 238, 7.2 Device Power Management Objects.
"For OSPM to put the device in the D3 state, the following must occur:
All Power Resources no longer referenced by any device in the system must
be in the OFF state"
If you want to put *any* particular ACPI device into D3, you turn off
*every* unused power resource, be them related or not to that device...
Windows XP seems to do it, and powers down the USB ports. None of them are
set for wake-from-S3, they all go to D3 and no references to the power
resources are left.  We probably should be doing the same.
