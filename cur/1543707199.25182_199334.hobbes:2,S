I don't see this. What's your I2C config, and how did you generate your 
config file?
CONFIG_FB_RADEON_I2C should depend on CONFIG_I2C, and it selects 
I2C_ALGOBIT, but your error messages seem to imply that you don't have i2c 
enabled at all.
Which implies a configuration error (but the Kconfig file looks correct, 
so I wonder if you found a bug in the configurator).
