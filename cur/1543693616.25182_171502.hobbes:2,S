I've looked through the uses of IRQ_DISABLED in 2.6.  Fun things found:
a) on alpha:
void
i8259a_end_irq(unsigned int irq)
{
        if (!(irq_desc[irq].status & (IRQ_DISABLED|IRQ_INPROGRESS)))
                i8259a_enable_irq(irq);
}
and similar in other ->end() 
on x86:
static void end_8259A_irq (unsigned int irq)
{
        if (!(irq_desc[irq].status & (IRQ_DISABLED|IRQ_INPROGRESS)) &&
                                                        irq_desc[irq].action)
                enable_8259A_irq(irq);
}
b) if we get *two* interrupts while irq is enabled and not registered, we'll
be stuck with IRQ_PENDING in addition to IRQ_INPROGRESS.  Which can, AFAICS,
confuse other code.
c) mind-boggling amount of code duplication - are there any plans to take
that stuff to kernel/*?
