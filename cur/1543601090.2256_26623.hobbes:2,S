  Actually I've seen the hang in getdir_unsorted() in 2.4.9-ac10 on directories
larger than 4Kb on NT 4.0 drive. I'll try your patch and tell the result :).
BTW: when I was looking into the code (if I see some obvious reason for deadlock)
I found following chunk of code in inode.c in ntfs_readwrite_attr():
                /* Read uninitialized data. */
                if (offset >= attr->initialized)
                        return ntfs_read_zero(dest, l);
                if (offset + l > attr->initialized) {
                        dest->size = chunk = offset + l - attr->initialized;
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
shouldn't this rather be 'attr->initialized-offset'? It would make more sence
for me to call ntfs_readwrite_attr() from 'offset' to read initialized data
and then zero the rest...
                        error = ntfs_readwrite_attr(ino, attr, offset, dest);
                        if (error)
                                return error;
                        return ntfs_read_zero(dest, l - chunk);
                }
