Shouldn't then sys_call_table be exported via arch/XXX/kernel/XXX_ksyms.c
instead of via kernel/ksyms.c so that it may be used only on those
architectures where appropriate?
Or is it useful on all architectures but each arch-specific code that uses
it should interpret it in its own way. Even so, it should live in
arch-specific ksyms.c so that future architectures don't export it
unnecessarily, until it is in a useable shape and form.
