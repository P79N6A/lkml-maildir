I hate to derail a good flame-fest, but this would be extremely useful,
for more than burning CDs.  Anytime you are dealing with a SCHED_FIFO
process a bug can lock the machine, this would be useful for hacking
jackd for example.
If someone wants to code this up I and the other people on jackit-devel
would gladly test it.
