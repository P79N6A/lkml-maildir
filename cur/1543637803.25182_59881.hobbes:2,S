All 2.4 and 2.5 kernels currently put all anon pages on the LRU all the
time.  And, yes, this creates great amounts of list scanning in
Andrea's VM.  Quite expensive for some workloads.
He took anon pages on and off the LRU several times shortly after
2.4.10.  They ended up "on". When I asked him if we could take them
off again earlier this month he said
"the only advantage they give us in 2.4 vm is that they let us know
 better when it's time to swap_out. without them, we'd start to swapout
 only when there's some significant amount of mapped cache, without
 regard of the amount of the amount of anonymous ram. In short swap
 performance are higher with this information. We could try to collect
 this info without having to waste time on the lru but I've never tried
 that."
However, with rmap things are different.  When an anon page
reaches the tail of the LRU and the access info is right, it
gets added to swapcache.  So anon pages on the LRU is a fundamental
part of rmap - there's no other way of getting at them.
I haven't yet checked whether the rmap design has reduced the CPU
load which I was observing in 2.5.24 from churning these
anon pages through shrink_cache().  Rik thinks it may do so.
