Why strlen() should be allowed to be called with an incompatible pointer
type? My point is that gcc should issue *different warning*, -- the same
warning it issues here:
$ cat incompat.c
void foo(int *p);
void boo(long *p) { foo(p); }
$ gcc -W -Wall -c incompat.c
incompat.c:2: warning: passing argument 1 of 'foo' from incompatible pointer type
Calling strlen(char*) with "unsigned char*" argument does pass argument
of incompatible pointer type due to the fact that in C "char" and
"unsigned char" are two incompatible types, and it has nothing to do
with signedness.
