It's the one with no chocolate syrup ;-)
Actually I just tried googling "define vanilla kernel" and the first hit
was:
"Web definitions for Vanilla kernel" en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_kernel
which does have the definition of the "vanilla" kernel.
Hmm, It also says under Maintainers:
2.2 	Marc-Christian Petersen (formerly Alan Cox)
Did Alan Cox change his name? :-)
