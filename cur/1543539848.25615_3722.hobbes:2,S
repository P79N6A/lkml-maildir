	That's very unlikely to be the case.  On a large system with lots
of users logging in all the time upgrading the flash on a disk not
currently in use shouldn't be a cause to reboot the machine.  I doubt
you'd upgrade the firmware on a disk currently in use, that might be messy,
but with the RAID ability we're working towards there is the possiblity
that one could slowly go through and upgrade all of the disks without
the users knowing anything.
	This is the kind of mainframe-like ability large data centers and
organizations are likely to find useful.  Yes, Linux still has a long way
to go, but it's working on it, and hopefully we can keep it nice and clean
all the way.

	This could possibly work as well, and in general is what is done
now on small systems, but that doesn't mean we should limit ourselves to
it.
