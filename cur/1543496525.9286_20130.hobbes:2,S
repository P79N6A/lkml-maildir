I'm reading linux source code, and confused by bitmap size of mem_map.
In free_area_init() ( init.c , kernel 2.0.35 )
...
for ( i = 0; i < NR_MEM_LISTS; i++ ) {
   unsigned long bitmap_size ;
   init_mem_queue(free_area+i) ;
   mask+=mask ;
   end_mem = (end_mem + ~mask) &mask ;
   bitmap_size = (end_mem - PAGE_OFFSET) >> (PAGE_SHIFT+i) ;
???????????????
   bitmap_size = (bitmap_size+7) >> 3 ;
   ...
}
on bit of free_area[i].map represent 2^(i+1) pages, so I think the line
with ????
should be:
  bitmap_size = (end_mem - PAGE_OFFSET ) >> (PAGE_SHIFT+i+1) ;
I know I would be error, but can anybody explain it to me, thanks very
much !!!!!
