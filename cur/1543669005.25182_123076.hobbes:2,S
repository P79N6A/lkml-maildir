It might do.  I have Ted's htree/NFS fixes in there though.
Felipe, please do 
	dumpe2fs /dev/hdXX | grep features
if it shows dir_index then it might be an ext3 problem.  If not then it is
probably an NFS problem.
If it does have dir_index set then please run
	tune2fs -O ^dir_index /dev/hdXX
and reboot and retest.
