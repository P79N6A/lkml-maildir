I am not asking the driver to fix errors in the EEPROM. I'm asking it to 
send and receive packets, as it has done in the past.

I do not expect the kernel to perform QA tests on my hardware, just work.

You publish your code under the GPL. You explicitly disclaim any warranty.

I suspect that if all/many T23 laptops perform as mine does then some 
major vendors will also edit their kernels. I'm sure they would rather not 
do that.

Can you provide a reference as to how I might do that?

Which it may be. But it doesn't work at all with the new kernel, where it 
has in the past.

I don't think either of us knows that.

That'd be great. Thanks!
