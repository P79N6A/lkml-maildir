You might want to take a look at Red Hat 6.2beta and/or the current
development kernels. I know very little of *BSD, but I assume they have
some sort of beta too. That way, your results aren't only for the (soon to
be forgotten) not-so-recent past.
Just curiosity: Why Red Hat? There are tons of other distributions around.
One condition: Share your results ;-)
