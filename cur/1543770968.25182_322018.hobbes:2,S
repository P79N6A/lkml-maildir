How does one demonstrate that something works without a test. You may
call it a "demo", but in reality it is just another test.  It's been
quite some time since I use to work on that, and I never read the
MilSpec myself, I was just told what to do by those that did read it.
But I would still call it testing.  Every requirement must have a way to
prove that it was fulfilled, whether it was by "demo", inspection, or
measurement, I would call all those tests. 
One of the tests that were done was to inspect ever module (or function)
for every code path it took.  This grows exponential with every branch.
Programs were written for each of these modules testing all paths by
sending in the input and seeing if the expected output was returned.
Binary branches had to be tested for all enumerations. "Greater Than",
"Less Than", "Equals" (and variants ">=") was tested for one unit less
than,  equal and one unit greater than.  This was only done this
extensively at the module level, then there were other tedious tests at
the integration level, and system level.  Could you imagine what it
would take to do this with Linux!  Linux is much bigger than that code
that ran the engine of an aircraft, and that testing took ten years!
Not to mention that Linux is a moving target, and the engine control
code was designed for a single purpose and a single type of hardware.
Before I put my hand under that saw, I would want to test it several
times with a hotdog first!
