Please define "standard Linux cache."
cachefs is used in situations where the cacheable data set size is
too large for the buffer cache.
As for using a mount parameter, that would be an NFS-specific solution.
What about caching large smbfs filesystems, for instance?  Or coda, or some
other network fs?
