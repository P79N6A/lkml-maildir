Hello,
I am running into a problem building 2.5.5pre1 on a Ultra5 platform.  I get
the following error when doing: make vmlinux
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-include 
scripts/split-include.c
scripts/split-include include/linux/autoconf.h include/config
sparc64-linux-gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.5.4/include -Wall
-Wstrict-pro
totypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing
-fno-common
 -m64 -pipe -mno-fpu -mcpu=ultrasparc -mcmodel=medlow -ffixed-g4

-fcall-used-g7 -Wno-sign-compare -Wa,--undeclared-regs
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=main 
-c -o init/main.o init/main.c

                 from /usr/src/linux-2.5.4/include/linux/blk.h:4,
                 from init/main.c:25:
/usr/src/linux-2.5.4/include/asm/mmu_context.h:37: #error update this
function. 
make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1  
If I am reading this correctly (and I doubt that I am :O) ) this is from the
include file mmu_context.h correct?  I diff'ed against 2.5.4 and they are
the same, and 2.5.4 compiled.  (Though I couldn't get 2.5.4 to boot on the
system.. but that's another story....)
Thoughts on were I am going wrong here?
Thanks,
Bruce H.
