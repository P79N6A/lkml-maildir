No, of course not.  I don't want to lose my data though
either.  How can I tell the kernel "never kill the programs
listed in this text file"?  I can't.  Not to my knowledge.
I'd like to be able to decide certain apps that never die, or
perhaps instead of certain apps.. certain 'conditions' that an
app can not be killed under.
For example..  if netscape is loaded, hasn't alloced memory in a
long time, or forced overcommited pages to be actually given,
then if OOM occurs, DONT KILL NETSCAPE.
I guess this problem is extremely complex though, so what I want
might very well be impossible.

Sorry... I was just giving off some steam with sarcasm
there.. Wasn't aimed at anyone.. more like yelling out loud in a
room by yourself when Windows 95 bluescreens for no reason and
kills 4 hours work.

Someone has mentioned bean-counters being a solution.  Perhaps it
will... but it'll likely be 2 years before we find out.  2.4.0
isn't out yet, and could be 2 months before it is.  Then it'll be
at least 18 months before 2.6.0 is out...   ;o(
What might be nice instead is a daemon that sets off an alarm at
when a predetermined amount of VM is used up - say 80% or
so.. configureable of course.  That might work good enough for me
for now.

I've overclocked my keyboard interface.  It's quite messy dipping my
hands into the mineral oil, but *MAN* is my keyboard ever fast now!
