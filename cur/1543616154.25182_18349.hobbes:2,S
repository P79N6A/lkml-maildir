Yes, and you can choose any one of a zillion registers to address
your "stack" although there are some de-facto standards, not enforced
by the hardware.  But this all comes with trade-offs discussed from
about all perspectives in the past, context-switches come to mind.
Using Intel, with the proper call-frame on the stack, `iret` switches
context. Setting the proper call-frame and saved register values is
easy because there are so few registers!

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
