This is exactly what I have my doubts about. These are three load
averages with different time constants - it isn't meaningful to
compare them so it doesn't matter if they are not sampled at exactly
the same time.
What caused me to look at this code is was a complaint in the exim
source about how long sysinfo() took compared with reading
/proc/loadavg - the difference is a factor of 100 which is large
enough to seriously affect exim's performance. This looks like a
possible cause.
