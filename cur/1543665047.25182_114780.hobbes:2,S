Also, when you are using LinuxBIOS then time for the hard disk to spin up
actually becomes significant. And it is of order of several seconds (and
up to 30 seconds according to specs for ATA). To counter this problem you
may want to put kernel and root stuff on Compact Flash and then use
CF<->IDE adapter to use CF as primary boot device. (As side benefit it
allows you to easily get around 256KiB limitation of most eerpom (bios)
sockets on your typical motherboard)
