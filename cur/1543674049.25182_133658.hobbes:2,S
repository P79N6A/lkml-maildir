 When I updated my tree (via bk cvs gateway) to make the patch I noticed
 some changes in sysfs's binary support.
 In general, they look good, but the size of files is set in
 sysfs_create_bin_file and not changeable later.  This breaks
 firmware_class.c :(
 With current request_firmware(), the drivers don't tell the size of the
 firmware, and in some cases they don't even know, so changing the
 interface is no good.
 I also don't understand why sysfs needs to keep a copy of the data in
 it's own buffer. It has to ask the driver for any read/write anyway,
 the previous approach of one page at a time looked better to me and
 saves some kernel memory :-).
 And the size checks could be skipped in case of zero size.
 I'll include a change proposal to sysfs/bin.c next time.
 Have a nice day
