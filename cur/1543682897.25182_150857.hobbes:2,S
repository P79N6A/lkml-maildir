half a megabyte more codesize is a lot if you're based on flash.
I know you absolutely disliked Andi's patch to make the xfrm subsystem
optional so we might need find other ways to make the code smaller
on those systems that need it.  Now I could talk a lot but I'm really
no networking insider so it's hard for me to suggest where to start.
I'll rather look at the fs/ issue but it would be nice if networking
folks could do their part, too.
