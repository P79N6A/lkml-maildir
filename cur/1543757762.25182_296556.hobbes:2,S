Yup.  Jamie says that the futex code _has_ to hold mmap_sem across the
get_user().  I forget (but could probably locate) the details.

It's fairly sane.  Style-wise I'd be inclined to turn this:
	down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
	while (!check_user_page_readable(current->mm, uaddr1)) {
		up_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
		/* Fault in the page through get_user() but discard result */
		if (get_user(curval, (int __user *)uaddr1) != 0)
			return -EFAULT;
		down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
	}
into a standalone helper function.

OK.

I don't think we need to hold mmap_sem while running get_zonemask().  `pol'
is a copy of current->mempolicy, and it won't be going away.
