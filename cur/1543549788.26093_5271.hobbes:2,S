the EXCLUSIVE thing only optimizes the wakeup, it's not semantic! How
better is it to let 100 processes race for one freed-up request slot?
There is no guarantee at all that the reader will win. If reads and writes
racing for request slots ever becomes a problem then we should introduce a
separate read and write waitqueue.
the EXCLUSIVE thing was noticed by Dimitris i think, and it makes tons of
(performance) sense.
