I certainly didn't propose that!  Just a layer on top of the
pci_alloc_consistent code -- used as a page allocator, just
like you used it.

What I sent along just compiled to 2.3 KB ... stripped, and "-O".
Maybe smaller with normal kernel flags.  The reverse mapping
code hast to be less than 0.1KB.
I looked at your code, but it didn't seem straightforward to reuse.
I think the allocation and deallocation costs can be pretty comparable
in the two implementations.  Your implementation might even fit behind
the API I sent.  They're both layers over pci_*_consistent (and both
have address-to-address mappings, implemented much the same).

Only if when you wrote "Java-like" you really meant "reusable"!  :)
