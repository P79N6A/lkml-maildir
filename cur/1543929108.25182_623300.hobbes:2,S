btw., if you start qemu like this:
qemu -cdrom ./cdrom.iso -hda ./hda.img -boot c -full-screen -kernel 
~/bzImage -append "root=/dev/hda1 earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,9600 
console=tty console=ttyS0,9600 enforcing=0 debug"
you'll get the inner kernel's serial console log to qemu's standard 
output. Pretty useful for capturing kernel crashes.
