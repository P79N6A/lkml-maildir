The START flag is equivalent to the first actual read, whereupon the
elevator code will do the Right Thing.

You simply increase the reference count of every dentry you visit, and
free it when the log is read.

Of course it does, because the kernel needs to wait for the next read()
system call from your application, which it can only do after the first
one completes, which adds another delay which will slow you down,
especially with high-latency I/O protocols.
