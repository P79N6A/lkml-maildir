No, it's nothing to do with journaling or not.  Even journaling
filesystems can suffer IO errors or corrupt disk blocks, and any case
where you have a file whose name has been lost due to such corruption
needs to be dealt with by the fsck tool.  Traditionally, fsck puts
such files into lost+found, and in the presence of data corruption, it
will still need to do so even with a journaling filesystem.
ext3 uses lost+found in exactly the same way as ext2 for this reason.
Cheers,
 Stephen
