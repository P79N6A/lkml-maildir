For the record, we (NEC) are also a potential user of this patch on
the TX-7 NUMA machines. For our 2.4 kernels we are currently using
something with similar functionality but only two hierarchy levels. 
I would very much welcome the inclusion of cpusets. The patch got much
leaner compared to the early days, big part of it consists of
documentation (good!) and the user interface (also very nice, although
it duplicates some code). The rest is just needed. Besides: it's
encapsulated enough and doesn't hurt others. (BTW: I could imagine
using this on quad-opterons, too...)

There's no relation to PAGG but I think cpusets and CKRM should be
made to come together. One of CKRM's user interfaces is a filesystem
with the file-tree representing the class hierarchy. It's the same for
cpusets. I'd vote for cpusets going in soon. CKRM could be extended by
a cpusets controller which should be pretty trivial when using the
infrastructure of this patch. It simply needs to create classes
(cpusets) and attach processes to them. The enforcement of resources
happens automatically. When CKRM is mature to enter the kernel, one
could drop /dev/cpusets in favor of the CKRM way of doing it.
