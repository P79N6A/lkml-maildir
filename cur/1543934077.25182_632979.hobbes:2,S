Not too sure on that one. I suspect one might have to trace the actual 
requests being received at the driver level somehow with buffered reads 
in order to diagnose what's going on there..

The settings in use should be reported in dmesg.

I believe those hdparm commands for power-save and AAM are supposed to 
work (they just issue an ATA command to the disk). The ones that aren't 
implemented are the ones that actually commanded the IDE layer, like DMA 
on/off.

Could be a udev problem, as it's what does the device naming..
