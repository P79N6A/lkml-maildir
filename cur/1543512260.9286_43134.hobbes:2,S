yes, just like SMP.  and the impact is very trivial.

four options:
a) use devfs and don't need to mangle /dev
b) use devfs and don't agree w/ naming/perms so choose to manually modify /dev;
use rc.whatever or devfsd
c) don't use devfs and run MAKEDEV and don't need to mangle /dev
d) don't use devfs and run MAKEDEV and don't agree w/ naming/perms and mod
rc.whatever or /dev
ab and cd are very similar save that ab has one less step.  consider that you
_know_ in each support call that the naming and major/minor are current.

in an earlier email you point out that because you have never met anyone that
does a certain thing that the point is moot.  i am a somebody that does that
certain thing; hot swap all day long.  two nifty and very handy things associated
with swapping pcmcia cards and usb devices.

c1t3d0s2 will always be c1t3d0s2 whereas sde will change depending on how many
other drives come before it.  and UUID is not a workable solution for non-RW
media.

moving the controller is one issue that remains, however most people appear to
move drives, in my case, removable media and non-powered media on scsi chains
changes the continuity of my drives.

cdroms have different labels and no uuid.  devfs cleanly keeps it ordered.

and devfs is a direction away from them.

similar to kmod, no?  devfsd again can be like quota utils and update an incore
map.

devfs is not bloated.

let's wonder for a bit.  i am a developer of a widget.  i change my major/minor
for my widgets.  i don't have to go update MAKEDEV and make a big notice to
everyone.  /dev will always have the naming constructs that i use in my code.

in my case, i have never needed devfsd.  in an earlier email you managed to make
a large action list for the kernel and devfsd to talk and update confs.  look
toward quota and see how it interacts with on disk files and in core.  start up
and shut down are your disk factor.  nothing else unless you choose to sync.  i
don't know of many people that lmbench startup and shutdown.

how many iterations of the F00F bug solution did we run through?  how many times
has the way SMP been done in the kernel been changed, or VM, or VFS?
"version 1" normally leads to "version 2".  we would be silly to think that devfs
is ultimately perfect and it never need be changed again.  heck, look at the
firewalling.  we have iptables now.  in the last five years we have had three
majorly different and incompatible ways of dealing with firewalling.  all of it
is made easy for userland by scripts and whatnot, and in core is made more
extensible and easy to manipulate.  the majority of people are probably satisfied
with their permissions in /dev and won't use devfsd.  for those who aren't like
yourself, there are options.  permissions can be easily set in the kernel make as
well.  just like cpu selection is or ethernet card is or etc.  one can be course
about it and have "open" and "paranoid" permission groups or can be fine grained
like soundcard and say specify precise perm values.  you can even have a range
inbetween these.

i compile new kernels several times a day for the hundreds of systems worldwide
that we manage.  devfs has enabled me to save a few minutes here and there
frequently and not worry about /dev updates.  over time, that translates to a lot
of saved time.   i've been using devfs for over a year now and i honestly say
that i don't worry about /dev and my troubles with adding devfs to the kernel are
by large "patch -p1 < devfs...".  that's a trouble i can sleep with most easily.

many of my peers use devfs and none of us have issues to deal with.  the costs
involved to date are a small amount of time during the week for one man,
Richard.  for the work that he has done, my benefits mean saving time personally
and a significantly lower accumulated load for that one class of servers that
stats /dev/ a lot.
for you the benefits aren't clear and for me the benefits are very clear.  it
solves a variety of little issues.  little issues compounded by numerous systems
makes for a lot of frustration and time.
we have a bunch of stuff in the kernel such as AX.25 and IPX because it benefits
someone.  i'm probably correct in that they don't benefit you.  nor do they
benefit me.  but i will staunchly support them just as i do devfs.
