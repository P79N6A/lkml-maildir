Yeah, I think that's called DIG64.  They had a reasonably nice HW timer setup, 
but not so nice for NUMA synchronization as the one we built into the 
[[Deleted by IP Police]] chipset.  That had snapshot and delta adjust logic, 
to synchronize nodes to one interconnect bus clock cycle.  Too bad that 
project was canned....
