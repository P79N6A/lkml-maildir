It depends. When CONFIG_USB_HID auto-selected CONFIG_INPUT, did the user
know about it? Or did it just happen automagically behind the scenes? If
it was turned on silently, and the subsequent de-select of
CONFIG_USB_HID silently left CONFIG_INPUT turned on, I'd say that
violates least-surprise.
On the other hand, if turning on CONFIG_USB_HID then prompts "to do
that, I also have to turn on CONFIG_INPUT", i suppose it's ok to leave
CONFIG_INPUT turned on later.
