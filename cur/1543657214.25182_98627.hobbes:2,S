Pulled, but that /proc/mm crap has to go (it wasn't in this patch, or I 
would have rejected it). 
What are the semantics the host code wants/needs, and how can we implement
a sane generic mechanism that doesn't involve opening magic files?
Having co-processes isn't wrong in itself, I just want the support to be 
clean and generic, instead of a huge hack.
