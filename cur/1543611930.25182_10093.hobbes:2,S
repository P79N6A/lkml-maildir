There's no reason we couldn't do this hint in kernel space.
In arch_get_unmapped_area we can simply keep track of the
lowest address where we found free space, while on munmap()
we can adjust this hint if needed.
OTOH, I doubt it would help real-world workloads where the
application maps and unmaps areas of different sizes and
actually does something with the memory instead of just
mapping and unmapping it ;)))
kind regards,
Rik
