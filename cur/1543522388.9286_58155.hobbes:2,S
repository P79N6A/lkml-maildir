It's true but not all true. For mail.linux.com there are record in blacklist
-- cut --
[khim@mccme khim]$ host 210.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org.
210.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org has address 127.0.0.4
[khim@mccme khim]$ host -t TXT 210.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org.
210.201.200.216.relays.orbs.org descriptive text "above.net has multiple open relays and has blocked the ORBS tester."

and different one
-- cut --
[khim@mccme khim]$ host -t TXT 210.201.200.216.ok.orbs.org.
210.201.200.216.ok.orbs.org is a nickname for 2.0.127.127.ok.orbs.org
2.0.127.127.ok.orbs.org descriptive text "This server has been tested by ORBS and appears to be secure against relaying"
