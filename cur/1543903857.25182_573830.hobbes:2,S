Definitely.
The pre-kernel init shouldn't be an issue: logbuf_lock is initialised at
compile time.
At oops time we could possibly use oops_in_progress to work out whether to
avoid taking the lock.  That's not terribly nice, but nor is it nice for
callers to know about printk internals.

You can't (or al least, shouldn't) use do_syslog() from within kernel code?

The interface is pretty bad, IMO:
 /*
+ * Read the log buffer into the supplied buffer.  The len option
+ * tells whether to copy from the beginning (> 0), the end (< 0), or
+ * just query the number of existing chars.   The number of bytes
+ * actually copied is returned.
+ */
+int log_buf_read(int len, char *buf, int grab_lock)
The magical interpretation of len isn't very nice.  This code would be
simpler if it did not attempt to read more than one char at a time.  It
will be plenty fast enough.
If the caller knows the length of the buffer, why is there any need for the
index-from-the-end function?
I think a sufficient implementation is
	int log_buf_len(void);
and
	int log_buf_read(int index);
which will return the character at `index', or -1 if `index' is out of
bounds.
