I believe Ted T'so (sp) wrote an ext2fs resizing program whicih is
available commerically as part of Partition Magic. AFAIK there is no
freely available program to do this.
You could simply create a swapfile on /dev/sda3 of the desired size and
use it concurrently with your swap partition (there is no problem with
having more tan one swap device active). As you say there is a slight
performance disadvantage with swap files over swap partitions but I doubt
if you would notice the difference.
