Even if there are different fields in there it is still much cleaner
and simpler if there is only a single number to manipulate.

It's merely an implementation detail of the instruction. But even on 32bit
there is about zero reason to expose that to C code. rdmsr/wrmsr et.al. should
have been defined as 64bit only interface in Linux from day zero.
