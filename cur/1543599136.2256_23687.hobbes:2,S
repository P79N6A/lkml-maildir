Margo Selzer wrote a nice paper on letting an elevator
algorithm take care of request sorting. Only at the point
where several thousand requests were queued and latency
to get something from disk grew to about 30 seconds did
a disk system relying on just an elevator get anything
close to decent throughput.
This paper convinced me that doing just elevator sorting
is never enough ;)

In that case, probably the readahead windows are too large
or the cache memory used for these readahead pages is too
small.
One thing you could do, in recent -ac kernels, is make the
maximum readahead size smaller by lowering the value in
/proc/sys/vm/max-readahead
