Reiserfs is a socially inclusive project, and if someone wants a field added,
they should just talk to us.
There is a reason why our motto is "It takes more than a license to make source
code open."
Particularly, if you want an optional field added, talk to us, dynamic space
allocation is a strength of our approach, and putting support for you in a next
major version of reiserfs is something we will do if you send me an email/URL
that convinces me your work is valuable (I am ignorant of it, educate me.)

Get Linux (
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS
 (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
