Sadly that didn't help. ACPI was not enabled, but APM was. I disabled
Power Management altogether in the kernel, and set all power management
features in the bios to disabled, but still the same thing happens. I'm
starting to think that someting has gone wrong with the DVD-drive,
especially since the same thing happens in that other OS.
Thanks for the tip though Alan,
