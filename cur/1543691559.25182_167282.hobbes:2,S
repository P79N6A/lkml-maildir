My reading of the boilerplate is that I can't use their code in
another GPL program, because their patent grant doesn't extend to
other programs.
Even if that's permitted by the GPL, it doesn't mean you have to
accept it into the kernel like that.
If that's just a misunderstanding of the legalese on my part, then
IMHO the text needs to be clarified to ensure that everyone knows they
may take the code and use it in other GPL projects.
