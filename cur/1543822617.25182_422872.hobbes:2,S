I'd go even further and say every symbol should have a category.  These
catgories than could get labels such as mostly stable, public but volatile
or internal (the latter is what's oddly named _GPL) now.  That way a small
look at a driver can say if it's doing something wrong, e.g. if a network
driver imports symbols from anything but BASE, PCI and NETDEV something
is most likely wrong.
