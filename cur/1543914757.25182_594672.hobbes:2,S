Right, the patch is wrong for those architectures which include
drivers/scsi/Kconfig directly, rather than indirectly via drivers/Kconfig.

The order was inspired by
	# the protocols etc.
	"Networking"
	# the interconnects
	"Device Drivers"/ "Network device support"
So that order is wrong too?
However, there is also precedence for the order which you suggest:  The
partition and filesystems options come after device driver options.

What is "Networking"?  Ethernet?  Infiniband?  ...?

Vice versa, I don't see any reason for "select SCSI" anywhere after my
patch.
