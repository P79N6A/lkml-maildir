this sounds correct to me.  the sample program sets euid to 500,
and leaves the group set alone.  since /home is owned by root,
the process will have neither owner access (not root) nor group
access (you state that root isn't in the group that owns the
directory).  therefore the stat() will fail trying to access /home.
presumably that's why relative paths work since none of the one's
you tested go through /home?
