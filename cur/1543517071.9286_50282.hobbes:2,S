Linus I subsribe to this with both hands. However I'm just going to use
the 
dirty heavy handed, brake it all, pig - patch just as a kind of
intermediary
trampoline to at least identyfy all the involved places. Surely there
is currently far too much kdev_t passing between all the different
components involved. However I have no illusions that it would be
possible
to just jump in with an entierly overwhelmed implementation... one needs
to think about some kind of "transition" path. (Or better call it
"liberation
path ;-).
