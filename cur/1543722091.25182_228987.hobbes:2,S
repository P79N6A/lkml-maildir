Hi, I just tryed to see what is behind the "dbg" symbol in the 2.4.24 source
tree, and noticed it was used in different places, with different meanings. I
also checked 2.6.6 source tree, and part of the problem is still there.
Problem: 
+ linux 2.4.24
in include/linux/usb.h
--> #define dbg(format, arg...) printk .......
--> #define dbg(format, arg...) do {} .......
and in include/linux/baycom.h
--> struct baycom_debug_data dbg;
and last in include/linux/soundmodem.h
--> struct sm_debug_data dbg;
+ linux 2.6.6
in include/linux/usb.h
--> #define dbg(format, arg...) printk .......
--> #define dbg(format, arg...) do {} .......
and in include/linux/baycom.h
--> struct baycom_debug_data dbg;
But no more occurence in soundmodem.h
This is no problem for me as I do not include all these files, just the usb.h
But this may be problem for others.
Solution may be to use usb_dbg instead of dbg in usb.h, as it has been done in
device.h and pnp.h
Bye.
I hope this will be usefull.
