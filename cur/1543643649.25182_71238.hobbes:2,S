   The following link points to the ebtables patch approved by Lennert:
   
http://users.pandora.be/bart.de.schuymer/ebtables/v2.0/ebtables-v2.0_vs_2.5.35-try3.diff
I'm applying this, but please in the future do not put these
"*** deal with blah blah" seperators in one big patch file.
Give me one bug patch I can just do a clean "patch -p1 <your_patch"
with, thanks.
Sure it's just noise and patch perhaps knows how to skip over it, but
lots of other patch reading tools might not be able to. (for example
diffstat gives a lot of different paths as the patch base directory
because you've done the patch this way).
