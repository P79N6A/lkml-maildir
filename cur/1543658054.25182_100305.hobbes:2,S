Actually, I guessed on my own, and this solves it:
append="hdc=ide-scsi hdd=ide-cd" in lilo.conf
In rc.modules:
/sbin/modprobe ide-scsi
/sbin/modprobe ide-cd
Gives this in dmesg:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
   Vendor: HP        Model: CD-Writer+ 9100   Rev: 1.0c
   Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
hdd: ATAPI 40X DVD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache, UDMA(33)
I don't actually know if the hdd=ide-cd does anything for the ide-cd
module, other than keep the ide-scsi module from grabbing it. 
Conversely, the ide-cd module only grabs hdd even when the ide-scsi
module is not loaded (making hdc free).  So it appears to do something.
As it turns out, the latest version of cdrtools (2.0) supports ATAPI 
drives directly.  I tested this by burning an ISO, reading it back, and 
comparing the md5sums.  So the whole ide-scsi exersice looks to be
academic at this point.
Have fun,
