Let's try this again.
(1) You are on a dynamic IP (dynamic IP dialup or DHCP lease)
(2) The dynamic IP addresses are recycled quickly
(3) You are on an IP address previously used by a system which had a daemon 
using port 24 and did not shut down the daemon correctly before 
relinquishing the IP.
So now there is a remote system which has an open connection to port 24 on 
"your" IP address, because it doesn't know that the system it was talking to 
isn't there any more.
(4) The remote sends a packet to your port 24
(5) Your patch causes the packet to be ignored
(6) The remote retries, because your system didn't respond to it properly 
(that is, by sending RST)
(7) The above continues until the remote decides that the connection has 
been lost or until something on your system uses port 24 (at which point the 
remote will finally be sent RST)
You seem to be certain that you'll never get a recycled IP address.  I 
suggest you learn how the real world works; granted that recycling IPs 
quickly "isn't nice", nevertheless it happens.  And it happens often enough 
that you have to deal with it.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
