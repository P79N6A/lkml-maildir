IMHO it makes perfect sense, since at this point, one more
allocation _will_ push us over the limit and let kswapd go
to work to free up more memory.
We just need to make sure that the "wake up kswapd and maybe
help free memory" point is EXACTLY the same as the __GFP_FAIL
failure point.
Unless off course I'm overlooking something ... in that case
I'd appreciate it if you could point it out to me ;)

Rik
