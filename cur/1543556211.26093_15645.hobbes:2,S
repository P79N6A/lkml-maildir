Hello,
I'm having troubles with the eepro driver included in kernel 2.2.17.
It stops sometimes with no apparent reason. The one thing i noticed
is that it seems to have a lot of carrier problems(998!)
This is part of the result from ifconfig:
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:AA:00:A6:05:01  
          inet addr:24.132.xx.xxx  Bcast:24.132.xx.xxx  Mask:255.255.254.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:248714 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:64711 errors:1925 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:998
          collisions:832 txqueuelen:100 
          Interrupt:10 Base address:0x230
Needless to say i didn't have this problem with previous kernels
(including 2.2.16).
Is there something changed in the driver for 2.2.17?
Thanks for the help.
Regards,
Jeroen Geusebroek
