I'm getting these freezes (timeouts) sporadicly on a normal IDE system
during normal runtime. Ext2 file system, no pattern except that it
never happens on the hdb disk. On hdc there is a cdrw and hdd a dvd:
loke:loke:~$ uname -r
2.6.11
loke:loke:~$ grep dma_timer_expiry /var/log/kernel
Mar  3 18:03:01 loke kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
Mar  4 19:54:47 loke kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
Mar 13 18:52:13 loke kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
Mar 15 13:35:10 loke kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
Mar 15 19:38:47 loke kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
loke:loke:~$ 
It began with kernel 2.6.11 and I reported it immediately:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110987450912711&w=2
Prior to that I was running 2.6.11-rc4 from Feb 13 to Feb 24 and -rc5
from Feb 24 to Mar 3 without these freezes. But perhaps that was too
short periods to catch anything.
Adding Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz to the CC list since it should be in
his corner.
