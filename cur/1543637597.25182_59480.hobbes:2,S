Hello,
Thanks to Lui-Chen Chang from SiS there is now ATA133 support for SiS 
IDE chipsets.
You'll find a patch against 2.4.19-rc3 (original Lui-Chen work) and a 
patch for 2.4.19-rc3-ac3 (a merge between my most current version minus 
experimental code and Lui-Chen's code) here.
It's currently harder for me to post patches on a web server as I 
usually did, so here there are, compressed with gzip.
People with SiS IDE chips, please test and report any failure/success to me.
LB
