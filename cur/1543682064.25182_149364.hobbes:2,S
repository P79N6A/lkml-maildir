OK. Just got home from work. I've tried booting and specifying geometry
via hdg=79780,16,63 hdg=noprobe etc... The geometry is accepted,
however, drive access fails when trying to read the disk. This geometry
is the geometry reported by hde (my old drive without screwy geometry).
 The code in calc_pdcblock_offset to calculate the offset is unchanged
in my patch (except the date type conversion to float) and calls
get_info_ptr for geometry. From what I can tell, this call returns the
physical geometry of the disk so using fdisk to fool it doesn't work.
I've also tried using unsigned long to store the calcs, multiplying the
capacity by 100 to start, doing the maths and dividing the final lba by
100. This doesn't work cause it overflows the data type. Won't I have
similar problems using fixed point? At this point, my very limited
knowledge of C keeps me from getting much further.
