Ok.  I have found a fairly clean way to structure the code that
should restore the previous behavior of the genapic_flat allowing
lowest priority interrupt delivery to work, and getting lucky
and avoiding your hardware that does not do what the software
tells it to :)
I still need to dig in and remove the BUG_ON in the interrupt
reception path, but that is a separate problem.
I also found another small bug in the pci_enable_irq because
of some code I failed to remove earlier, and the patches overlap
so I have made this a small patch series.
I have tested the code as best I can, and confirmation that this
fixes the original problem would be great.  But I don't see how
it could fail to fix the problem, as it restores genapic_flat to
global vector allocation.
