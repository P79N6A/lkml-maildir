The distributions you named earlier all patch the kernels they ship with
their distribution.
There's only a handfull that install a vanilla kernel by default (out of
the >200 distributions available)
debian, redhat & gentoo patch their kernels.
Is your problem that a kernel is not the kernel.org vanilla version? (If
so have a fit @ debian, redhat and gentoo as well )
Or that Suse's does not work with your income generating product?
