It still does mostly, that's one case I missed. The old config had more 
than one semantic regarding visible input range (the shell 'if' semantic 
and the dep_* dependencies, which differed again between the commands), 
kconfig has only one. So it's not matter of restoring semantics, but 
translating them correctly. In general a symbol is now visibile is if the 
dependencies are !='n', "restoring" would mean to change this into ='y' 
only for tristate symbols when MODULES='n', this would be an even larger 
hack. Translating 'm' into 'm && MODULES' is the cleaner solution, as it 
doesn't change the base kconfig logic.
bye, Roman
