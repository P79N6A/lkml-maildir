Andrew,
Would you consider adding this patch to -mm?  This would add the DMAPI
interface to JFS.  This function has long been requested by HSMs
(Hierarchical Storage Managers).  It is based on SGI's XFS
implementation, but has been clean up to avoid their vnode interface.
Most of the code is in the fs/jfs/dmapi subdirectory.  The amount of
code in the normal jfs codepaths is quite small.  There is no code
outside of fs/jfs.
Due to the size of the patch, I haven't included it here, but it can be
downloaded from
http://www10.software.ibm.com/developer/opensource/jfs/project/pub/dmapi/dmapi-2.6.4-rc2.patch
There is a user library which can be downloaded at
http://oss.software.ibm.com/jfs/
Thanks,
Shaggy
