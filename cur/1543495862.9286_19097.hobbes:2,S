Hm.  I've run all of them up to 2.2.7 and had no problems.  But I've got
Red Hat 6.0 now-- I'm going to patch it up to 2.2.9 and cross my fingers
and hope that it works :).  I think that Red Hat patches the kernel
themselves, and if they do, these patches my not work... and I *really*
don't want to download the new kernel! :)
