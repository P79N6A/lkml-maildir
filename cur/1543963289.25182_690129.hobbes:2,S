Hello Rene,
It's only because when I got the box I had to make it run as soon as possible, sooner than I'd had time to investigate which possible benefits I would have had from running a 64bit distribution.
Further, since I had to install a Gentoo GNU/Linux distribution by "emerging" from a chroot(-ed) environment inside an Ubuntu 32bit one (it takes too long to explain why), I supposed I couldn't do that for installing a 64bit Gentoo. Still today I don't know whether or not I assumed that wrongly.
Today I would switch to a 64bit Gentoo but, first I don't know how to do that in a secure and fast way, second I still don't know if it is worth the job... 
Could you please summarize which benefits I would gain from that?
