Hi, a kind of repost 
useing lvm2(with lvm1 everything is working perfect for the last 6 months)
 when i try to mount a xfs filesystem wich is on 
lv over soft raid-0, i'm getting just like in
2.5.2x - 2.5.4x (i didn't try later kernels) :
############################
raid0_make_request bug: can't convert block across chunks or bigger than 16k
25181311 4
raid0_make_request bug: can't convert block across chunks or bigger than 16k
25181343 4
############################
is this know problem, is it fixed ?
i thought that the problem exist only in 2.5 kernel
everything works with reiserfs and jfs
( well not really sure but i could transfer ~10Gb to and from the LV, mkfs ..)
but with xfs got this:
mkfs.xfs -- 
device-mapper: unknown block ioctl 0x6424
device-mapper: unknown block ioctl 0x6424
and with mount again :
raid0_make_request bug: can't convert block across chunks or bigger than 16k
213164570 4
raid0_make_request bug: can't convert block across chunks or bigger than 16k
213164602 4
any hints?
regards,
svetljo
