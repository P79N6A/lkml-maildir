Here are the problematic spots for me with Q5:
rtl8139_poll (this one was also present with previous versions of the
patch) :
http://www.undata.org/~thomas/q5_rtl8139.trace
use_module (modprobe) :
preemption latency trace v1.0.2
-------------------------------
 latency: 154 us, entries: 4 (4)
    -----------------
    | task: modprobe/8172, uid:0 nice:0 policy:0 rt_prio:0
    -----------------

=======>
00000001 0.000ms (+0.000ms): resolve_symbol (simplify_symbols)
00000001 0.000ms (+0.000ms): __find_symbol (resolve_symbol)

00000001 0.154ms (+0.000ms): sub_preempt_count (resolve_symbol)
and a weird one with do_timer (called from do_IRQ) taking more than 1ms
to complete :
