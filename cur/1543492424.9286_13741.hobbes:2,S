	I'm not sure...
a) if (bh->b_dev) in insert_into_queues looks odd - either it should be
if (bh->b_dev!=B_FREE) or it is dead code. B_FREE is *not* 0.
b) AFAICS code assumes that each buffer_head is either unused (everything
except b_next_free zeroed), or sits on a cyclic list (through b_next_free
and b_prev_free). If the buffer_head is free (b_dev==B_FREE) list in
question is determined by b_size (free_list[] one). Otherwise the
buffer_head is hashed (through b_next and b_pprev) and list is determined
by b_list (lru_list[] one). If that is right we shouldn't leave unhashed
buffer_head on active list - it should go to the corresponding free one.
	It looks like we actually need to replace
remove_from_hash_queue(bh);
	with
remove_from_queues(bh);
bh->b_dev = B_FREE;
insert_into_queues(bh);
	IOW, transfer such buffers to the free list.
