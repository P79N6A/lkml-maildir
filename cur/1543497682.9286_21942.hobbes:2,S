All of the file handling needs to be validated wrt SMP threading, and I'm
not ready to do that yet. We have a bigger project underway to try to make
the page cache do proper writebacks, and that's taking priority. 
Your approaches look reasonable. I don't think we need the compatibility
thing you have in fput() though - it should rather be just done right, and
I don't think lazy_fput should be needed.
