Yes. It's 2.5.33 + 2.5.33-mm2 (by Andrew Morton [is that what you meant?]).
Aaaah! I got it. I just wanted to write an email expressing that for some
strange reason latest 2.4 kernels (2.4.19-ac4, 2.4.20-pre5+latest ACPI)
work without a problem.
You know what the difference to my 2.5 kernels is..... CONFIG_PREEMPT is not
enabled with my 2.4 kernels but with 2.5 it is!
Here we go.
Maybe someone can now get an idea on what the problem is and maybe how to
fix it?!
My best regards,
Axel Siebenwirth
