What!?  Parsing an oops isn't kernel specific?  Version tracking over
multiple separate trees as diverse as 2.4 and 2.5 isn't pretty kernel
specific?  In any case, people could take the kernel bug database, and
genericify it, much more easily than somebody could tailor an existing
bug tracking application to the needs of the kernel, (which is
demonstrated by the fact that the developers are not getting Bugzilla
reports).
