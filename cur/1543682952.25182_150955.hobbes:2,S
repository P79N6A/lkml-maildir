Actually, perhaps some of the non-functional and misfunctional things
might get fixed first and save the diet for 2.6.5 or so. There is no
lack of things which haven't been quiet ported from 2.4, don't work
right, etc.
I doubt that the people who care most about size are going to be doing
a fast change to 2.6 until the dust settles.
