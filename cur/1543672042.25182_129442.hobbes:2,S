Oh man...
I must have been sleeping when I posted that patch...
the correct line should AFAIK be:
video_size = screen_info.lfb_width * screen_info.lfb_height * video_bpp;
(AFAIK we are calculating bits here, not bytes so the '/8' you used is 
wrong... could you try without it, and let me know...)
or even shorter:
video_size = video_width * video_height * video_bpp;
I'll be rebuilding and retesting my system today or tommorrow,
but I wuold like to hear if it works for you...
