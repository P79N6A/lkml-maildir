Ah, that rings a bell. Does 'grep MPPARSE' find a match in your .config
even though SMP and *APIC are disabled? That's a scripts/Configure bug:
it enables MPPARSE because CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC was enabled at the start
of this Configure run, even though CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC was disabled later.
Another 'make oldconfig' fixes it.
