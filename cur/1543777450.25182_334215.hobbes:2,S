I think you might be mis-characterizing Nish's and my idea. To me it
sounds very close to what you are suggesting w/ the HZ=2k idea.

But confusion is the problem we have now. 
People think in time, so they try to convert it into jiffies using HZ,
but then they're surprised when things happen early since the interrupt
freq isn't quite HZ but ACTHZ. Then if you fix that, you still have the
issue that if they use clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) to measure your
timer request it may still be early because jiffies aren't NTP adjusted.
We're not suggesting using timespecs for timers internally, just
do_monotonic_clock() which in Nish's patch returns 64 bits of
nanoseconds since the system booted and doesn't go backwards.
> In other words, you select the thing we call "jiffies".
In Nish's patch, do_monotonic_clock() is used in almost exactly the same
way as jiffies is used. 
Imagine HZ is a billion we have perfect timer hardware (which increments
jiffies exactly each nanosecond)and replace jiffies w/
do_monotonic_clock(). 
That's effectively what you get only without having the timer interrupt
go off a billion times a second. Instead, the timer interrupt can go off
at whatever frequency and soft-timers don't have to care. All interrupt
frequency changes is worse case latency.

I agree we have to keep time somehow, but we already do and we already
keep nanosecond precision. So why don't we just use it instead of some
low-res interrupt counter?

In my mind, consistency. 
I mean, if I understand your suggestion w/ HZ=2k. Effectively you are
just redefining jiffies to be some fixed unit (effectively 500
microseconds). Then when timer interrupt arrive at some frequency lower
then 2kHZ you have to add more then 500usecs to jiffies. Right?
This is what we already do for timekeeping. The only difference is that
timekeeping deals with the HZ/ACTHZ issue and NTP adjustments and we
keep nanosecond precision.
