Subject: Lost versioning from last build -- How to recover?

Could someone explain to me, please, what I need to do?
An accidental build in the kernel source tree has changed my struct
modules version # and I need to restore it to match the currently
running system.
Rebuilding the kernel and restarting the system is an option but I
prefer not to restart the machine.
uname -a output: 
Linux tantra 2.6.10-rc1-bk12 #8 Thu Nov 4 08:27:45 MST 2004 i686
Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 1.80GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
# strings ax25.ko | grep srcversion
srcversion=4AA459CA4F655956DE1DFC3
Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.
