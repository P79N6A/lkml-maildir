I'm seeing BUGs like these on all libata-driven controllers when 
suspending to disk on 2.6.20-git6:
sata_nv 0000:00:07.0: resuming
BUG: at drivers/pci/pci.c:817 pcim_enable_device()
Call Trace:

It looks like what's happening is that during the "freezing" stage, we 
suspend and then resume the controllers. ata_pci_device_do_suspend only 
calls pci_disable_device if the event is PM_EVENT_SUSPEND but 
ata_pci_device_do_resume calls pcim_enable_device unconditionally. If 
the event was something else, then pcim_enable_device complains because 
the device was previously enabled and never disabled.
Not sure what the best way to fix this is?
