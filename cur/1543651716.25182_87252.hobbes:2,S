Which hardware is connected to your SCSI adapter? (hint: cat /proc/scsi/scsi)
I've found out that some IBM hard disks give the above error when too
many tagged commands are queued (firmware bug probably). I definitely
have a DDRS-39130D drive which shows this behavior. The old SCSI
driver (5.x) was not as bold as the 6.x driver which is in 2.4 with
regards to queueing: the 6.x driver use 253 tagged command openings by
default.
For me, passing `aic7xxx=tag_info:{{,,,8}}' to the kernel solved the
problems. The above tells the aic7xxx driver to limit tagged queuing
depth to 8 for the drive at ID 3 on the first aic7xxx adapter, but
YMMV.
Phil.
