Hi all,
Can someone give me some hint or link for the following question :
I have several processes blocked in 'D' state, and I surmise they are
waiting for a semaphore (in the `down' routine).  How is it possible :
- to verify the processes are really blocked on a semaphore,
- to see which semaphore they are waiting on,
- to find out which process/driver/whatever holds those semaphores.
If that matters, I work on a m68k board.
Thanks in advance
Philippe
