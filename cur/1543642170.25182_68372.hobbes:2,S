Nope, not confused.
I'm trying to find out why Windows doesn't choke on the strange
READ_CAPACITY value.  My guess is that there is code somewhere to
universally fixup READ_CAPACITY, and I'd like to know what the magic
formula is.
The MODE_SENSE bit is fine by me.  But it's a SCSI change, so I'm not the
person to ask.  The fix to sddr09.c for that seems reasonable, but you put
it all together and I haven't had time to split it up.  Of course, I fully
expect the changes to MODE_SENSE in the SCSI layer to break other USB
devices, but there is only one way to find out....

It's not that hard.  No matter what the problem is, tell the customer 
to reinstall Windows.
