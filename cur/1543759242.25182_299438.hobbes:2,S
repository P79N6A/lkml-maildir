Its irrelevant. Most of the "must fix" items are security. They don't
have a convenient testing life cycle. Many of the others are things that
need a prompt fix and the same problem applies.
After all if it was in -mm then someone knew about it and would have
said "this has to make base before its released"

And occasionally it will be wrong. It happens. Linus released 2.4.15,
I've released -ac patches and stuff that needed immediate "oh duh, try
the next one"
results. The important thing is that there is a base 'stable' release
that is almost always stable. That is as good as you'll get.
