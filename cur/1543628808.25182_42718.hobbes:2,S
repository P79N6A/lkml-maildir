Hi,

Actually, no: To fully use 160GB ATA drives, whatever device is on the other end of the ATA bus needs to actively support 48-bit address mode. In for the two cases you tried, that means 
IDE: The kernel IDE driver needs to support 48-bit addresseing to support 160GB.
SCSI: The firmware in your IDE<->SCSI Adapter needs to support 48-bit addressing.
So, while the symptoms are the same in both cases the problem is actually in two completely different places.
Most probably, you can't do anything about the IDE<->SCSI adapters firmware; however, you can do something about the linux ATA driver: code is in the 2.4.19-pre tree, it went in with 2.4.19-pre3.
Bye, Martin
