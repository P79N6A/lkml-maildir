When I read that question, it sort of feels like a mind bender. It's the
"did not occur" , most people are thinking "which version of the kernel
did I find this in", but it's asking the opposite ..
For bug #8945 I really don't recall the version of the kernel I ran when
it worked .. I had to do a bisect to get some clue about that ..
nmi_watchdog isn't something I use every time I boot (I should tho), and
I go through lots of kernels ..

In terms of regressions, it would be nice for the "Version" field to be
the kernel where the regression first showed up .. Like on bug #8945 I
put in 2.6.22 even tho I found the issue in 2.6.23-rc1 .. Is that
typically what the "Version" field is used for?
