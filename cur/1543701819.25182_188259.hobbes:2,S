I've attached an old CPU memory latentcy test that ram quite happily on 
linux SMP machines until today.
I have a Dual AMD 2400 with an MSI K7D-Master, IG RAM.
The problem is that the test segfaults in random places.
The code is quite simple, using fork and a shared mmap()ed file.
Code goes like this:
Map a temp file shared.
initialize some ptrs.
fork
    - child busy loops reading data from shared memory
    - parent busy waits (using tsc) then sets mem location
    - child pops out of loop and also reads tsc
    - parent busy loops reading data from shared memory
    - child busy waits (using tsc) then sets mem location
    etc etc
Core files indicate that the memory is unavailable however gdb indicates 
that the memory is readable.
I'm downloading 2.4.23 and I'll give that a go later.
If anyone wants to try it for me on a 2.6 or a 2.4.23 kernel I'd 
appreciate that.  This could concievably be a hardware problem but that 
seems unlikely since the machine has been very stable for quite a while.
Ideas ?

//	This is intended to run on a dual CPU PII or better system.

//  CPU making a change to memory to the other CPU being able to
//	react.  This latentcy is a critical factor in shared memory
//  parallel communications.

// Description
//	This program sets up a page of shared memory and then forks.
//	Each process will share the page of memory and will use it
//  to do raw shared memory spin locks using a simple while()
//	loop.
//
//	The child process goes into a spin and the parent process
//	wakes breaks it's spin.  Both processes read their respective
//	time stamps just after these events.  The parent process waits
//	for the child to place the counter value in the shared memory
//	and then measures the difference.  The roles are then reversed
//	and this interaction is measured 10 times.
//
//	If the time stamp counters are not set up correctly by the OS
//	you will get weird behaviour.
//
//	This is the output of a run on a Tyan S1837 with PIII 450's using
//	a stock RH 6.0 (2.2.5-15smp) Linux kernel.
