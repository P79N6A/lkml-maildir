thanks for your work, andrew.

ps: i have only this one production box, as will most audio people.
while we're doing a lot of application testing, these kernel patches
are a lot more complicated for us to do. i'm certainly willing to
keep up with the latest patches, but please acknowledge it's a whole
lot more painful for me than for experienced kernel wizards with a
dedicated kernel dev box.
btw: is there any web resource on how to restructure one's system to
have a working fallback w/o fuss while being able to play with the
latest dev kernels plus the corresponding userspace upgrades
(preferably w/o repartitioning) ? i went through having 2.0 and 2.2
in parallel for some weeks and it gave me a headache.
