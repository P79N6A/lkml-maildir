This needs to be :
		case NOTIFY_DONE:
		default:;
		}
or later gcc's whine.

You forgot to remove this comment.
        if (!list_empty(&(handler->link)))
                return EBUSY;
This wants to be -EBUSY (it eventually gets returned to userspace via
oprofile, and is more common anyway).
static int nmi_std (void           * dev_id,
                    struct pt_regs * regs,
                    int            cpu,
                    int            handled)
I don't think this matches the usual kernel style.
I think the rest looks OK, I'll find some time to play with oprofile
side of this.
thanks
