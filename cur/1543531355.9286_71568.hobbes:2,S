According to the SC520 manual, the input to the PIT is 1.1882MHz.
According to the SC300/310/400/410 manuals, the input is 1.1892MHz.
I think that covers all of the ELAN processors and their 
apparently inconsistent weirdness; the ELAN processors are the only
ones AMD makes with the on-board PIT.
An updated patch that handles all of the above is attached.
