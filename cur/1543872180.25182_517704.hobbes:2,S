is this how long the "paravirt_ops hides all the details and the VMI 
hypervisor ABI will never hinder Linux" sham lasted? Now that your stuff 
is upstream barely 2 weeks you say that it needs a redesign of your 
hypervisor to implement our suggestions? And your argument is: "oops, 
we've got product plans, too late for that, sorry"?
_we_ have to live with that mess for years, and part of our job is to 
say 'NO' when we see mess coming up. And no, it's not our job to solve 
it for you.
