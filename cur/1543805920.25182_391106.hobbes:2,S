OK, I will put an explicit initializer for that static variable.

get_max_files() is needed by unix sockets which can be a module.
IIRC, xfs needed get_nr_files() when I originally wrote this patch. 
There doesn't seem to be any in-tree use now,
but files_stat was earlier exported and we should probably
mark this for unexport at a later time.
