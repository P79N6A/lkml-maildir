One note: please, please, let's put a moratorium on sysfs-related patches
that didn't go through review.  We are just getting netdev situation in
the main tree under control.  It took nearly half a year (if not more).
And now we've got *exact* *copy* of the change that had started that mess -
this time in fbdev.  Sure, there's fewer fbdev drivers, so it shouldn't
take that long.  But then it's not 2.5 anymore...
If you are doing any sysfs integration - *fix* *lifetime* *rules* *first*.
You can do that in a way that will avoid breakage or need to revisit the
drivers when kobjects get embedded - just have your my_subsystem_release()
defined as kfree() and on the last step replace its body with kobject_put(),
moving the actual freeing into ->release().
Even if you are sure that you can fix all drivers in one go, there's no
need to turn the entire series into "must merge at once" monster - if nothing
else, reordering it that way will make testing easier.  Sigh...
