I use the same board with ACPI enabled, no slow down.
The only problem I experience is that USB doesnt wakeup after resume from S3, reloading all of the related modules doesnt help, the port seems to be unpowered (usb optical mouse blinks for a few miliseconds after reloading uhci_hcd, maybe there is some little power left).
