Yeah they are kind of different. PG_freeing isn't a really good
description for it. Basically it is set to guarantee a page won't
gain any more references (real, not speculative) than what page_count
returns.
I'm in the process of recovering one of those with an earlier set
of patches (PG_reserved).

PG_free can't be shared with anything else, unfortunately. It doesn't
need to be an atomic flag though, so it can be an "impossible"
combination of flags.

I think there are a a few ways that bits can be reclaimed if we
start digging. swsusp uses 2 which seems excessive though may be
fully justified. Can PG_private be replaced by (!page->private)?
Can filesystems easily stop using PG_checked?
OK, I'll cut the hand-waving: PG_free used to be derived from
PG_private && page_count == 0, so it could instead be
PG_active && !PG_lru quite easily AFAIKS. If this patchset ever
looks like being merged you can take me up on it ;)
