I just got a warning message with 2.6.18-rc3 that I've never seen before :
  ReiserFS: sda4: warning: vs-8115: get_num_ver: not directory or indirect item
The message showed up twice in dmesg during two parallel "make -j3"
builds of the 2.6.18-rc3 kernel source in two sepperate directories.
I've tried to reproduce it but without luck.
It would be nice if someone could tell me what the message means and
wether or not I should be worried about it.
