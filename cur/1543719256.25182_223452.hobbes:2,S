Disagree! Mirroring with ftp is possibly quite a waste of bandwidth (at
least in case partial file transfers etc.), and IIRC you can't reliably
mirror symlinks (IIRC the "ls"/"dir" output is only ment to be
human-readable), hardlinks and the like.
If you see aborts, properly set the timeout parameter...
