As far as we can tell the problem is 'using a VIA chipset'. The code itself
is a fast copying loop using mmx/3dnow/amd athlon extended mmx stuff
Pick up an Athlon documentation set (pdf on the web site) and you should be
able to follow it. prefetch does what you'd expect, sfence is a store fence
for non temporal stores (ie out of order stuff) amd movntq is an out of order
move

That doesn't have CONFIG_MK7k
