May I recomend a read of Documentation/i386/boot.txt, it explains exactly
what is done
Protocol 2.02:  (Kernel 2.4.0-test3-pre3) New command line protocol.
                Lower the conventional memory ceiling.  No overwrite
                of the traditional setup area, thus making booting
                safe for systems which use the EBDA from SMM or 32-bit
                BIOS entry points.  zImage deprecated but still
                supported.
2.01 may have had the issue you speak of, looks like this fixes it.
