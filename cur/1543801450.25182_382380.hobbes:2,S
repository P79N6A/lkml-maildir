I booted with the 2.6.15 driver and got a silent digital out, like
reported. The headphone which is plugged into the analog output gives
sound.
If I load the 1.0.10 driver, sound works in xmms. If I unload it and
reload the original 2.6.15 driver, sound still works. If I reboot with
the original 2.6.15 driver, the digital out is silent again, while the
analog output works.
However, if I now chose a specific output device in xmms, hw:0,2,
instead of the default device, digital out gives sound. With the 1.0.10
driver, this hw:0,2 device stays completely silent (digital and
analog). With this version, the hw:0,0 device (which seems to be the
default) gives analog and digital sound.
So IMHO this mixup of the devices is a regression, since it breaks
existing setups and is also fixed in newer versions. It would be nice
the see a fix for this in 2.6.15.x.
