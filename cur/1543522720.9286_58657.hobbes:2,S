Michael,
	You might want to try out Andrea's alpha bigmem patch:	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.14/bigmem-2.2.14-7.gz
I just installed it my ES40, and it sees 4 gigs of memory:
[ezolt@cpu98 /tmp]$ free
Unknown HZ value! (4096) Assume 1024.
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       4101872     490184    3611688     743152      21896     374288
-/+ buffers/cache:      94000    4007872
Swap:       129016          0     129016
Cheers,
