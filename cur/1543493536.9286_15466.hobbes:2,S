On the GNU tasklist there is a project (not to imply that any actual
work has been done) to build a freed-software BIOS. It would be interesting,
although the current chipset support neccessary in (for example) the IDE
device dirver look like potato chips compared to actually initialising the
disk controller chipsets, the display adapter chipset, the cache controller,
etc.
There really isn't much advantage to placing vmlinux into a flash ROM module,
either.
