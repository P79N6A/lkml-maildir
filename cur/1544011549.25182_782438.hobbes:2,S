   The word is reserved since ATA-2, and ata_id_major_version() should 
be returning 0 for pre-ATA-3 drives, so I don't know what else can be 
done here...

   I'm still not getting how drive can support or not support "DWORD 
I/O" -- you certainly can't have 32-bit I/O cycle on ISA (only on EISA) 
and you certainly cannot translate 32-bit cycle to the ATA bus. I 
remember I had some hypotheses before but they turned out to be 
inconsistent.

   Indeed, already ATA-1 says that the word 48 is "includedfor backwards 
compatible VU use".
