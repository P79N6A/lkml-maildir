Hello,
I always configure and compile a kernel throwing out all unusable options and 
I never use modules in production environment (especially for the router). 
But my superior has got the other opinion - he claims that distribution 
kernel is quite good and in these days optimization has no sense because of 
powerful hadrware. 
What do you think? I have few arguments for this discussion but I wonder what 
you say. Please, try to substantiate your opinions.
And the second question: which kernel branch/version *and why* do you use in 
production environment?
Regards
