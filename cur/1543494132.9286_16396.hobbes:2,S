In the original post, Giuliano said that he umounted the drive, so
everything the system knew about the drive should have been thrown away
then, surely ?

This kind of situation could cause all kinds of nasty disk corruption in
Windows 3.1, for example with Excel, when an application kept a file open on
a diskette across a disk swap.  The people who have to work out the possible
paths through the disk swap code must have acquired very twisted minds by
now (and little clay dummies of the designers of CP/M, compatibility with
which is probably to blame for all this, to stick pins in).  But with a
mount/umount setup, this should be impossible.
