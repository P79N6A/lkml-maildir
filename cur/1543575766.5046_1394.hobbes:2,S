ugh, bad form, i know, but i forgot this little dollop of information:
it looks like the incorrectly mac addressed n.s. packets are being fed
right back into the linux box's ip stack (as it sees an ethernet packet
with the destination set to its own mac address): 
[root@nsv6 /root]# ping6 X:Y::1
PING X:Y::1(X:Y::1) from X:Y::4 : 56 data bytes
From ::1: Destination unreachable: Address unreachable
From ::1: Destination unreachable: Address unreachable
    .
    .
    .
From ::1: Destination unreachable: Address unreachable
64 bytes from X:Y::1: icmp_seq=16 hops=64 time=433 usec
64 bytes from X:Y::1: icmp_seq=15 hops=64 time=1.000 sec
the pings start working when i put the X:Y::1 box's ethernet card
into promsc mode and it sees an ipv6 packet destined for one of its
multicast addresses.  (i guess promsc mode tells the eth to just ignore
all link-level addressing info.)
