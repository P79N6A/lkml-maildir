It only took me 45 min to have X crash 2.4.0-test8-vm3,  It occurred when i
opened and closed xawtv a few times while the system was under stress from
other apps (~1 load ) ... the shm segments kept increasing and i noticed
something strange.
------ Semaphore Status --------
used arrays = 1
allocated semaphores = 14
It's always been 0 with the previous tests and with this test9-pre6 kernel.
Not sure what the significance of it is.
SHM segments are increasing (they only go away when X closes) .. swap seems
to be stable for now    here is the ipcs -u   output
------ Shared Memory Status --------
segments allocated 1379
pages allocated 8770
pages resident  8329
pages swapped   0
Swap performance: 2956 attempts  0 successes
------ Semaphore Status --------
used arrays = 0
allocated semaphores = 0
------ Messages: Status --------
allocated queues = 0
used headers = 0
used space = 0 bytes
I'm not sure how that swap performance is supposed to be, i need someone to
compare to that has this stuff working and does not have the SHM problem ...
i expect to crash within an hour.
