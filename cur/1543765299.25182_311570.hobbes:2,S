hi ,
Thank you for your reply, can i ask some more question?
Inside the system call , the kernel often copy the data by calling 
copy_from_user() rather than just using strcpy(), is it because the 
memory mapping in kenel space is different from user space?  for example 
, now user program want to pass a pointer *a to kernel space , is it 
true that *a seems means address 0xb000 to user space but actually it is 
at 0xc000 at kernel space?
Thx a lot,
TOM
