Hello,
I'm migrating to 2.6 after having used 2.0,2.2,2.4 for quite
some years now.
At a first glance, I read ide-scsi is dropped. Okay, no SCSI
support at all for me then. I have one CD writer, and now it
gets reported twice, which I don't understand. I have
CONFIG_IDE,CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE,CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDSK,CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTIMODE,CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD
set. dmesg reports: "hdc: PCRW804, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive" first
(ok), then "hdc: ATAPI 32X CDROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache,
DMA". Prior to the second report, an error is generated:
"end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 0". Reading works fine,
haven't tested writing yet (nor installed X, hence the omission
of blank lines in this mail). Is this a RTFM problem...? Kindest
regards, Xander.
