Plain hard links.

Current filesystems would need a fs-wide search for soft links,
but this is avoidable by storing a list of links in the inode.
That must be done carefully though, or you'll get another
problem:  if I move a high-level directory, will I have
to update links and inodes linked to 
that exists deep within some subsubsubdirectory?
This had better be unnecessary, meaning the in-inode list
of "reverse links" can't contain paths.
Perhaps the can contain the inode numbers of the referencing directories.
Deleting a file with this new kind of links will then cause
searches in various directories containing those links.

This stuff is possible if we get a new type of link then.
I wonder how exisitng link-aware tools will cope.
