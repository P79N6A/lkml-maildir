In this game, I tend to leave it up to the individual and groups to 
fight for whatever they want as it's sometimes a bit of concerted action 
that yields results. It can be a protracted exercise, but nothing 
ventured, nothing gained. The situation has improved as far as vendor 
support is concerned, it started at zero, but still not all we would 
like and may never be, so it's a case of eating what you have on your 
plate and asking for more - no bones broken.

It's users of that calibre and vendors with the clout of IBM, Dell, HP 
etc. that can help and the fact that Linux will rapidly be a good 
revenue stream for the most open of manufacturers. Today in Linux we are 
not where we were 10 years ago and 10 years from now we won't be where 
we are today and the signs are good.
