  Anytime I try to install an rpm, or even run "rpm -qa"  2.5.70, and RH 
9.   I get the following error.
error: db4 error(22) from dbenv->open: Invalid argument
error: cannot open Packages index using db3 - Invalid argument (22)
error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm
no packages
  If I reboot into redhat's 2.4.20-9 rpm works fine.  As far as I can 
tell there doesn't appear to be any file system corruption.
