Seems to be kind of dual licensing:
"The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.
   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all
   executables, including commercial programs.
   See below for details and restrictions."
It extends the scope of the license to _linking_ with commercial
software.
