Make sure this optimisation also works when the system's running low on memory
if workqueues are involved in "making forward progress".  Doubtless there
are other reasons for apparently-unused workqueues too.
How about reviewing each particular workqueue that you've identified to see if
it can be created later or even not at all, or destroyed while it's not being
used, or if some workqueues can be shared - rather than presuming that a change
like this would be safe globally?
