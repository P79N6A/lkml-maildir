Hmm.. I start wondering if this is what I see too..
Both 2.2.18 and 2.4.0 hangs for some reason that I have not been able to 
trace down - Saturday I tried to remove all PCI cards but my 3dfx and AIC7xxx
  00:0f.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AHA-7850 (rev 01) 
Has some driver been ported between 2.2 and 2.4 series recently ?
I have not seen this problem before...
I will try the new driver too...
