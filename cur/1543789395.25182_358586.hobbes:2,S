No they are not.  IBM X460s are generally available machines and  the bug
affects those boxes. How can there be a major kernel release which is known
to have breakage??  
Maybe someone with access to ia64 NUMA boxen can check if the NODE(0)
solution works (and does not break anything) on ia64?  Chrisoph, can you help?
Thanks,
Kiran
