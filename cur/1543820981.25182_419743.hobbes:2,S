2.5GB/sec isn't that much, and remember that is with the system fully
loaded and spending _all_ its time in the kernel. It's the pure page
cache lookup performance, I'd like to think you should have room for
more. With hundreds or even thousands of clients.
The point isn't the numbers themselves, rather the scalability of the
vanilla page cache vs the lockless one. And that is demonstrated aptly.
