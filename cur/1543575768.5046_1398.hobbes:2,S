Just to add a "me too" on this. I didn't report when I saw it last week,
because I was uncertain of exactly what might have caused it - I was
booting several different kernels at the time, including one from a
rescue disk (I was trying to salvage bits of a Win9x disk at the time -
don't ask for details!)
Alas, I lost the test program someone wrote to test for the truncate
problem, and due to moving I will not be able to test anything until 
next Monday. But if needed, I can do some testing then. Something 
definitely went wrong with innd during the test12 pre-patches.
