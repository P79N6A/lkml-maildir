I've just checked this with Thunderbird (which is the mail client I use).
It not only sets the disposition=inline by default when attaching 
patches, it also places the patch inline when replying to it, allowing 
the user to write between the text of the patch as if it were part of 
the email text.
However if we Copy+Paste the patch into the mail it gets line wrapped / 
white space mangled.
So at least for Thunderbird users it would be better to use attached 
patches with "Content-Disposition: inline".
