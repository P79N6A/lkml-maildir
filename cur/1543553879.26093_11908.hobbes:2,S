#define MAX_PERSIST 100
int mode[MAX_PERSIST];
int owner[MAX_PERSIST];
int group[MAX_PERSIST];
MODULE_PARM(mode, "1-" __MODULE_STRING(MAX_PERSIST) "ip");
MODULE_PARM(owner, "1-" __MODULE_STRING(MAX_PERSIST) "ip");
MODULE_PARM(group, "1-" __MODULE_STRING(MAX_PERSIST) "ip");
Resulting data looks like this, trailing all zero values are removed.
mode=420,420,493
owner=0,0,1
group=0,0,2
No need for a separate size field.  Note that MODULE_PARM is built at
compile time so all persistent data must have a fixed compile time
size.
Pure binary immediately runs into kernel version skew problems.  If the
data in kernel 2.4.n is
struct { int mode; int owner; int group; } persistent[MAX_PERSIST];
but kernel 2.4.n+1 has
struct { int mode; int owner; int group; long acl; } persistent[MAX_PERSIST];
Then saving binary data from kernel 2.4.n and loading it into 2.4.n+1
or vice versa results in garbage because the structure format has
changed.  Separating individual fields and treating them as text has no
such problem.  I have already decided that persistent data will not be
passed to insmod on the command line, instead insmod will read directly
from the saved data file, that removes any worries about command line
limitations.

If the values are implemented via modules then make them persistent.
OTOH if they are implemented via code that is built into the kernel
then insmod is far too late.

Now you are getting into the area of configuration utilities and the
interface between such utilities and the kernel as a whole, not just
modules.  That is a seperate problem and is best left to the
configuration tools that already exist.  Module persistent data is
intended for values in individual modules that the user changes daily
or even hourly (volume, TV tuner), not for overall system control.
