I noticed in hci_core.c:
hci_dev_close call hci_dev_do_close , then call hci_dev_put
but in hci_dev_do_close  also call hci_dev_put
Maybe this is the reason, by apply the below patch the bug seems
doesn't exist,  but the strange thing is the 2.4.22-rc4 seems works, I
will test once more to see the result.
