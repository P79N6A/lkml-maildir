That it is allowed by my generic code that does spin_lock_irq in down_* and
spin_lock_irqsave in up_* but it's disallowed by the weaker semantics of the
generic and x86 semaphores 2.4.4pre[2345] (or + David's last patch).

Caller bug is the last of my worries. (and I seriously doubt that if somebody
doesn't know the semantics of the rwsem, he will care to enable the debugging
checks during regression testing ;)
