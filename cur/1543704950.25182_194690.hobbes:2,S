Hello!
First, thank you very much for the effort you put for Linux!
I have a Intel motherboard with SATA (2 Maxtor disks).
CPUs: 2 x 2.4GHz PIV HT = 4 processors (2 virtual)
1 GB RAM.
Load: postgresql and apache. Very low load (3-4 clients).
RAID: Yes, soft RAID1 between the 2 disks.
I have times when the console freeze for 3-4 seconds!
2.6.0-test11 had the same problem (maybe longer times).
2.6.1-rc2 worked good in this respect but crashed after 2 days. :(
2.6.2-rc2 is back with the delay.
Do you know why this can happen?
Thank you very much!
