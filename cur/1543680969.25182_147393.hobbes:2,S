Nope :) They will run their timeslice entirely and then they will try to
get some more. Looking at their last recharge timestamp, Dad scheduler
will put them in bed and will give other tasks a chance to run. But don't
worry, I am very sure there're other exploit available. I just didn't have
enough time to think about it. It is amazing how limited are things that
you can do in one hour :)
