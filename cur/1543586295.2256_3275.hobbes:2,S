You cannot expect that all people will instantly start using the
latest driver from your Web site, immediately.  Especially considering
1) There is no MAINTAINERS entry listing you or your web site
2) Your e-mail address is nowhere to be found in the code
3) The driver Web site address is nowhere to be found in the code
4) People are used to getting aic7xxx out of the kernel tarball
Are people just supposed to pick up your psychic waves?  :)
