Better might be to use the x86-64 trick of using sequence counters
around do_gettimeofday, and avoid the xtime lock altogether.  That
will improve gettimeofday performance as well.  Or you could try
changing xtime lock to a brlock.
FYI: as policy, I don't take optimization patches without
measurements.  I'm just not that smart.
Thanks,
Rusty.
