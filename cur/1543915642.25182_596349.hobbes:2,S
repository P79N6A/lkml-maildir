Please have a look at the patch header at:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/18/346
And at the documentation:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/18/375
Where I provide speedups experienced with this patch. Please note that
my primary goal is to provide non intrusive instrumentation with the
Linux Kernel Markers, and the immediate values are the underlying
mechanism that help enabling/disabling dynamically instrumentation sites
with the smallest effect possible (and still get the local variables
in the middle of a function compiled with -O2...).
