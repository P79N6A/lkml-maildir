I also remember this been discussed anually. Making it configurable with
a warning might be a solution, but that's nothing we could decide. Maybe
add a config option? It night be a [DANGEROUS] one, so the guys and gals
who might compile are warned of changing this.
I think the problem is that on PC arch anything is quite limited.
