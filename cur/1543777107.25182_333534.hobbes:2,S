I fear the empty patch the script gave me yesterday wasn't meant 
to be empty...  [Yes, I'm going to switch to quilt just as soon as 
I can make time to convert everything.]
I'm downloading -mm2 as I write this to check, but I can't
spot the part of the patch that updates dm-table.c to read:
void dm_table_presuspend_targets(struct dm_table *t)
{
        if (!t)
                return;
        return suspend_targets(t, 0);
}
                                                                                
void dm_table_postsuspend_targets(struct dm_table *t)
{
        if (!t)
                return;
                                                                                
        return suspend_targets(t, 1);
}
