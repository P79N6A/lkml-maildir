Subject: [RFC] zero downtime upgrades to the kernel.

Has anyone investigated how one might be able to upgrade the linux 
kernel without rebooting?
We could maybe start with just being able to upgrade kernel modules 
while the modules were still in use.
E.g. There is a bug in the hard disc driver, and we have a fix, but 
don't want to reboot the machine.
Could we replace the hard disc driver while it was still being used, and 
keep mounted partitions?
