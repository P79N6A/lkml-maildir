Hi, Andreas.  Yes, I've had some success with that approach and it's nice to
see this particular wheel being reinvented.  The original suggestion came
from SCT by the way.

Set_blocksize looks like a malformed idea anyway.  I guess its purpose in life
is to get around the fact that we don't know the filesystem blocksize until
after reading the superblock.  So why doesn't the filesystem just fill in the
field in struct super_block and let the vfs worry about it?
If we are going to integrate buffers with the page cache then we have
buffer->page->mapping->inode->super->blocksize and we usually have most of
that chain dereferenced in all the interesting places.

It's a step in that direction.  Because of the page vs block size mismatch I
find myself still using the buffer_head as a data object, typically because
of locking granularity problems.  If we are really headed towards variable
page size then this problem goes away, and the struct page can be the data
handle in every case.  This is looking more likely all the time, which is one
reason I took the side trip in mm hacking - to understand that code well
enough to know if there are any real stoppers.  At this point I don't think
there are any.  Looking through what little literature is available on this,
fragmentation is the only real problem mentioned, and we're already busily
chewing away at that one.  Rik's rmaps would help a lot there.
