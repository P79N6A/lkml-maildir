Subject: [CFT][PATCH] ext2 directories in pagecache
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/9/26/124

	OK, it seems to be more or less working. Patch is available on
ftp://ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-patch-6.gz.
 It's against -test9-pre7.
Help in testing is welcome, just keep in mind that it's ext2 we are
talking about. IOW, proceed with care and don't let it loose on the data
you can't easily restore.
	Patch moves the directory data into the pagecache. I hope that
it's sufficiently straightforward to be readable.
	Linus, if you prefer to get it in the mail - tell and I'll send it
(50K unpacked due to ext2/{dir,namei}.c modifications, so it's too large
for the lists).
							Cheers,
								Al
