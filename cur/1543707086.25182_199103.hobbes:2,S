Actually it isn't throttled down, only sysfs is showing it with low 
speed. It *is* running @ 3.12 (or /proc/cpuinfo and boot messages are 
lying to me) when in full power.

Sure but if i want to downgrade it, for example, by night, to a lower 
speed, and then next day return it to full power? Will I stuck at 2.4GHz?

Indeed. I'll showing in LCD a lower speed than the running.

Três anéis para os Reis Élficos sob este céu,
    Sete para os Senhores-Anões em seus rochosos corredores,
Nove para Homens Mortais, fadados ao eternos sono,
    Um para o Senhor do Escuro em seu escuro trono
Na Terra de Mordor onde as Sombras se deitam.
    Um Anel para a todos governar, Um Anel para encontrá-los,
    Um Anel para a todos trazer e na escuridão aprisioná-los
Na Terra de Mordor onde as Sombras se deitam.
