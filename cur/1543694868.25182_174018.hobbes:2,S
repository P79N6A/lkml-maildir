I am using ACPI and it seems to work fine (no error messages on boot, 
able to read battery status, AC adapter status and shutdown/reboot using 
it).
I seem to recall that "standby" is S1 in ACPI terms. Does the lack of 
"S1" in the above list mean that my hardware doesn't support standby or 
that the kernel doesn't?
Also, just to make sure, for the "mem" suspend function, it doesn't 
matter if the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_PM_DISK or 
CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND or none of them, right? Only CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP 
matters?
