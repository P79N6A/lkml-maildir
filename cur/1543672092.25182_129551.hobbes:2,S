Is that practical?  I can see how with some daemons it would definitely be
useful to prohibit exec calls (maybe things like BIND don't need to exec
anything).. but some daemons do need to exec.  An SMTPD may need to exec()
some helper processes (postfix for instance has a whole slew of helper
programs it uses).. and things like sshd need to exec a shell, etc..
It's still a good idea though, since some daemons don't need to exec,
ever.  I guess this is one extra layer of protection.  As Ingo said in his
announcement, the more layers of protection you have, the better.. and the
more difficult a cracker's job is.
