Hi,
Like I right for rt7 , I had successfully boot without notsc,
but not all times.
The same happens with rt10 I can have 3 results when I boot without
notsc (with notsc I don't had/see any problem) : 
1st boot without errors  (dmesg on
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6419#c59
 )
2nd hangs on boot with last message
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse as /class/input/input1and 
3rd boot but gives a long oops.
(dmesg on 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6419#c60
 )
Thanks,
