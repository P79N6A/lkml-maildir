Hello,
I am experiencing dramatic interactivity degradation when
apt-get upgrade is setting up the packages under X, with X running with
nice 0 (it previously had -10)
x-terminal-emualtor windows stop getting refreshed, xmms stops playing,
and after a few seconds everything stops responding and gets going after
another few seconds.
under 2.4, with loads like that (it is not much) interactivity was fine.
2.4, 2.4aa, 2.4-preempt, 2.4-ck, all of them did not result in this
behaviour.
Also sometimes these effects seem to be not related with load, i see no
disc activity, no applications, and still the system hickups.
It happens with 2.5.65, and all -mm[123] patches. (Although i belive mm3
to be a bit more responsive than the rest). I have no history of using
anything prior to 2.5.65.
How can i provide usefull information with what i am experiencing?
What /proc knobs would you recommend to experiment with ?
Regards,
Maciej Soltysiak
