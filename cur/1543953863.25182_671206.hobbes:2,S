Doh, that was a pretty silly typo. Thanks, I've merged it with the
patch!
So now I/we just need to figure out why the hack to call
init_call_single_data() is needed. You seem to imply it was being called
too late, I thought perhaps too early. Where did you stick the
init_call_single_data() call in?
