Prism54 (fullmac) does background scanning all the time when the
interface is up.  You can't turn it off AFAIK.  If you look at SIWSCAN,
you'll see that it's essentially a NOP since the firmware is always
scanning, and you'll always have up-to-date scan results.  Ideally, all
drivers would do it like prism54 does (and some later ipw versions, I
think).
