Yes.
Recursion should be detectable automatically, the only thing you can't 
detect easily is the reason to _break_ recursion. 
So how about just having a simple loop finder, and then the only comment 
you need is a simple /* max recursion: N */ for any point in the loop.
That still makes it interesting if one function is part of two loops, and
is logically the place that breaks the recursion for one (or both - with
different logic) of them. But does that actually happen?
