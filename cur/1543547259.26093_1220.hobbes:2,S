Hello,
I noticed that with kernel 2.4.0-test7 the system seems 
to use all cpu capasity although there are only a few 
processes running and none of them use a lot of cpu capasity..
CPU states:  0.0% user, 100.0% system, 0.0% nice, 0.0% idle
it always shows 99.0% - 100.0%..
is this a bug in the kernel or something else?
if it's a bug is it already fixed in test8?
cpu  578713 0 42816936 0
cpu0 578713 0 42816936 0
