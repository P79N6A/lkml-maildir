IIRC, I avoided list.h because I only wanted a singly linked list (it
never gets traversed backwards). List.h looks to me like all doubly
linked lists. Do you know if there are any other singly linked list
implementations I could piggy-back?
That said, since there's normally not that many extents, I could switch
quite easily and it wouldn't normally waste much memory.

For this use, they're swap extents. For another use I have in suspend2,
they're sector_t >> block_device_size. That's why I picked ul; something
generic in what's supposed to be a generic implementation.
Thanks for the comments.
