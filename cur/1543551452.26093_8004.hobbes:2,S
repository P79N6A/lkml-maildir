A segment is just a window mapped on top of virtual memory.  A process
can have many segments, but only has one virtual memory mapping.  You
cannot use segments to access memory that isn't mapped into the virtual
address space, which is where the 32-bit limit exists.  It may be
possible to use the segment not present fault to switch page tables, but
this would be very unportable and would incur alot of extra overhead.
