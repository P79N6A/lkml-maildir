Subject: One more boobytrap needed for 2.2.15pre ?

Seems that we need to check whether task is in run-queue in schedule() before
calling del_from_runqueue(). Currently I'm adding such test and some debugging
output in del_from_runqueue() if task to be removed is not in queue 
(prev_run==0 || next_run==0). Before I added this check kernels beginning with
2.2.13 (or even earlier) were very unstable for me (rather often oopses or
total freezing, mostly when running KDE). After adding this check there were no
more oopses and freezings (only error messages, however they seems to be 
more seldom with latest prepatches of 2.2.15). Currently I'm using 2.2.15pre7,
but I got such messages also with it (once per 16 hours uptime running
2.2.15pre7, affected application were kwm but often it's also maudio).
Here is debug data I got this last time:
del_from_runqueue(C0098000) : Task not in run queue
prev_run=00000000  next_run=00000000  state=1  flags=100  nr_running=2
prev_task=c2314000  next_task=c09c2000  pid=183
current=c0098000  current->pid=183 current->state=1 current->flags=100
 
Process 183 is kwm (KDE window manager) and it is still alive (I'm writting
this message without restarting KDE)
