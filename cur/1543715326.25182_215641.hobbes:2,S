The sysctl is /proc/sys/kernel/hz_timer. If it contains a "1" then HZ timer
is
active in idle, a "0" indicates that the HZ timer is switchted off.
The semantic "the next tick is THIS many <ticks> from now" IHMO doesn't make
any sense. Skipping ticks will have some really bad effects, e.g. if the xtime
isn't up-to-date network packets will get incorrect time stamps, timer events
will be delivered too late, etc.
