Until someone gets off their butt and assembles a set of user
space kernel headers, the correct answer is "don't include kernel
headers, instead make private copies of the needed kernel defines
and structs and fixup the kernel types to use C99 types from
stdint.h"
I.e. do for yourself what the kernel folk have not done,
