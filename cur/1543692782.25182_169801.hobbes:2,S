Not really an improvement IMHO. The returned errors are unclear, the tools 
seem to ignore the verbose command line option. As a result I have been 
fighting with ALSA modules, modprobe.conf and modules.conf for days now. I've 
not managed to get all dependancies right yet, the only way to get my SB Live 
working is loading 20 modules by hand, one at a time... Somehow modprobe 
remains complaining about unresolved symbols.
FWIW: 2.6.0 test 6, module-init-tools 0.9.14, mandrake 9.1 with modutils 
deinstalled.
