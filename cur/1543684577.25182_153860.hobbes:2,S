Probably, with a little care.
A userspace copy while in an atomic region is actually legal, on behalf of
the read() and write() pagecache copy functions: if we take a fault while
holding an atomic kmap, the fault handler bales and the usercopy returns a
short copy.
In other words: if you stick a might_sleep() in __copy_from_user() and
__copy_to_user() you get a false positive on every read() and write().
We could probably add it to copy_to_user() and copy_from_user() though.
