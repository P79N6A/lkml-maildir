Load an fbdev driver and look in sysfs. fbdev already has the ability
to list the valid modes via the 'modes' parameter. Copy one of those
strings into 'mode' and your more will be set.

But it is very hard to merge DRM and fbdev without touching the fbdev
code and getting things mixed up.  Plus there is no guarantee that BSD
will even use your code if you keep the license clean. Other OS's
don't necessarily like the Linux fbdev model.
