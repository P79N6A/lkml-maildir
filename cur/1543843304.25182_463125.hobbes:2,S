AFAIK it was mostly for APM and various BIOS bugs.  IIRC Wine had 
some special requirements at some point too, but I can't remember them right
now. On x86-64 I use all GDT entries, although there are a few special 
ordering restrictions due to the semantics of SYSCALL. I ignored Wine too and 
so far nobody has complained, so whatever requirements they have they can't 
be that important.

The only way to find out would be to do it. It's quite possible that all 
the systems with APM BIOS that needed it are long beyond their MTBF.
