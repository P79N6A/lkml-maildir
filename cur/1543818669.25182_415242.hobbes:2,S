Yes- that was on a good kernel, with the patch reversed.
On a bad kernel, with the patch applied (2.6.16-git16):
tcp_wmem: 4096    16384   4194304
tcp_rmem: 4096    87380   4194304
tcp_mem: 98304   131072  196608
They seem to be identical, which makes sense, since most websites work 
just fine.
I am sending tcpdump's privately to you and Stephen. If anyone else 
wants to see them, just ask.
Daniel
