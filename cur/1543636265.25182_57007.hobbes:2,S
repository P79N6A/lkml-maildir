yes, that's exactly the point of SCHED_BATCH. Furthermore: it enables the
correct timeslicing of such SCHED_BATCH tasks as well between each other -
so it's not equivalent to 'infinitely low SCHED_NORMAL priority', but it's
rather an additional hierarchy of scheduling classes. Plus it uses longer
timeslices.
