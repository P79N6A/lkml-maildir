The problem is that the bus specific core registration no-longer knows if the 
probes succeeded or failed (and if they did, what devices were attached), 
since probing is controlled by the base core.
What the bus needs to know is when a driver attaches to a specific device (and 
what device it has attached to).
Unless you have a better way of getting the attachment information out of the 
bus after the base probes have executed, a notifier seemed to be the simplest 
thing.
