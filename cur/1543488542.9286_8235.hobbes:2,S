Hello!
I'm having a slight problem with the Magic-SysRq combo, it doesn't work at
all.
I guess the problem is caused by the following set-up:
I'm using an old DIN keyboard, connected the PS/2 keyboard-connector on my
motherboard through a simple converter.
Some info about my system:
Noname Dual P-II 350, 128 MB RAM, 1 IDE HDD, 1 IDE CD-ROM, a Gravis
Ultrasound (for which the OSS-driver still isn't good!), a Matrox Mystique
G200 [AGP], a "FlyVideo Lifeview" TV-card [PCI] (which, BTW, doesn't give me
sound yet, anybody having some hints - it's based on the Bt878 chip, if you
need other chip-numbers, I can pull it out of my case and write them down)
and a noname NE2K-PCI NIC (which is working great).
Kernel: 2.2.2-ac3 #10 SMP
Err, well, this is the ac4 kernel, with the Makefile-bug.
Attached are two (commented) showkey-dumps, which indicate something is
going wrong in the kernel, and my .config - I'll try to reproduce this while
running a more-bleeding-edge-kernel on my laptop, just to make sure this is
a kernel-problem, and if I can recreate it with a real PS/2 keyboard.
Or, if this is a userspace problem, can someone point me in the right
direction?
VrGr,
