Ok, this is absolutely bizarre.  If I run JACK from a GNOME terminal,
even with a large period size, all I get are these error messages:
load = 0.1875 max usecs: 5.000, spare = 1328.000
delay of 2996.000 usecs exceeds estimated spare time of 1328.000; restart ...

delay of 53432.000 usecs exceeds estimated spare time of 1310.000; restart ...
etc.
If I run if from an xterm or a text console, it works perfectly, even 
with a really small buffer:
load = 0.9302 max usecs: 5.000, spare = 661.000
load = 0.8405 max usecs: 5.000, spare = 661.000
load = 1.7716 max usecs: 18.000, spare = 648.000
load = 2.1621 max usecs: 17.000, spare = 649.000
load = 2.8828 max usecs: 24.000, spare = 642.000
load = 1.8168 max usecs: 5.000, spare = 661.000
load = 1.2838 max usecs: 5.000, spare = 661.000
load = 1.7680 max usecs: 15.000, spare = 651.000
load = 1.2594 max usecs: 5.000, spare = 661.000
load = 1.0051 max usecs: 5.000, spare = 661.000
etc.
I have no idea where this bug could be, it seems like it would have to be 
display-related.
