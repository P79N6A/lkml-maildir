To take another example why is this still insulting and inappropriate, 
this is a behaviour I would characterize as school bullying:
A bully attacks someone obviously weaker than himself and for example 
takes something away and than continues like "If you ask nicely I'll give 
it back to you.", this often accompied by laughter to signal he's enjoying 
himself and the power he has, but for the other person it's everything but 
funny.
Maybe you don't know what it feels like, but I do and I can't find 
anything funny, sarcastic or whatever about this, no matter how many 
smileys or other tags you add there. If the communication is already that 
troubled as this, such "humor" is really the worst thing you can do and I 
find it rather sad that you can't realize this yourself.

Sorry, that is too little too late. You've apologized before and you 
continued to make fun of me personally to the point of spreading wrong 
information about me, which you could have very easily verified yourself, 
if you only wanted.
What I want from you is that you treat me with respect and to keep your 
"sarcasm" to yourself.
I told you very clearly how I think about you requoting this crap and yet 
you repeat it again _twice_, so on the one hand I get this apology attempt 
and on the other hand you continue to kick me in the crotch? How do you 
think am I supposed to feel about this?
It's also always interesting what you don't respond to. I asked you for 
examples which would prove the (rather strong) assertions you made about 
me, what does it tell me now if you can't back up your statements?
bye, Roman
