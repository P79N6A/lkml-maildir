Flush is what is needed, flush is what it does in 2.4, and flush is what 
it should do in 2.6 :)
Rebooting does not shut down nor unload the IDE driver, so it is 
-critical- that a flush occurs before reboot, otherwise it is entirely 
possible that writes the drive has ack'd back to the OS will not 
actually get written to the media.
