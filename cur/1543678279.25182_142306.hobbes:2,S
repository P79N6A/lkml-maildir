Hi, 
I'm trying to boot a 2.5.72 guest in VMware workstation 3.2. 
It uncompresess the kernel, says it is booting linux, and that's the
end of the console messages.  
I have the feeling that I have possibly grossly misconfigured the
kernel. Does someone have a working .config file?
Just in case it's something more interesting, kgdb (which hasn't hit
it's initial breakpoint yet) shows:
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttys0
Remote debugging using /dev/ttys0
0x3c0a2965 in ?? ()

Thanks for any help.
