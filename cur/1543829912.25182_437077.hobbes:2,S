Then you lose the ability for each namespace to have its own routing entries.
Which implies that you'll have difficulties with devices that should exist
and be visible in one namespace only (like tunnels), as they require IP
addresses and route.

Sorry, I don't get the second idea with only some information private to
namespace.
How do you want TCP_INC_STATS macro look?
In my concept, it would be something like
#define TCP_INC_STATS(field) SNMP_INC_STATS(current_net_ns->tcp_stat, field)
where tcp_stat is a TCP statistics array inside net_namespace.
