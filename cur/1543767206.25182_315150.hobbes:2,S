Without it, folk will then do (and this is taken from someone elses
example):
  cd /usr/src
  tar -xjf /path/to/linux-2.6.x.tar.bz
  cd linux-2.6.x
  mkdir -p _build/arm
  cd _build/arm
  cat >GNUmakefile <<EOF
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
KERNELSRC    := /usr/src/linux-2.6.x
KERNELOUTPUT := /usr/src/linux-2.6.x/_build/arm
MAKEFLAGS += --no-print-directory
ARCH            = arm
#CROSS_COMPILE  = arm-unknown-linux-gnu-
CROSS_COMPILE   = arm-linux-
all:
        $(MAKE) ARCH=$(ARCH) CROSS_COMPILE=$(CROSS_COMPILE) -C $(KERNELSRC) O=$(KERNELOUTPUT)
%::
        $(MAKE) ARCH=$(ARCH) CROSS_COMPILE=$(CROSS_COMPILE) -C $(KERNELSRC) O=$(KERNELOUTPUT) $@
EOF
  make xconfig
  make
which I think you'll agree is far worse.
