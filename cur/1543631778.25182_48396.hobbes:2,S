That's because of 2 reasons:
    a) AT&T was apparently unfamilier with diff(1)
    b) Bill Jolitz choose to keep his mouth shut so that 4BSD would get
       freed up.  And got publicly humilated for it and still held his
       tongue.
Here's a clue: go diff bmap() in 4.x BSD and in 32V.  Word for word, bit
for bit, comment for comment, identical when I did it.  And I think anyone
can verify that, both versions of the code are out there now.  And I also
think that you, Al, would agree that bmap() is a pretty profound part of
the file system.  That AT&T let that one slip is mind boggling.

Huh?  You lost me.  For the record, I do think it's that simple.  And in
personal conversations with Victor, he's indicated that it is that simple.
What else do you think is there?  I'm missing some subtlety here, bang me
on the head with it.
