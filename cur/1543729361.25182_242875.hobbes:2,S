I am probably missing something, but cant something like attached
work ?  I am definately not sure about the mode passed to the second
verify_command in sg_scsi_ioctl ... (Note I have never really hacked
anywhere near the scsi layer, or done userspace scsi coding, so be
nice =)
Patch is based on vanilla 2.6.8.1, with the bits from Andreas' last
patch, with MODE_SELECT_10 changed to read again.
Thanks,
