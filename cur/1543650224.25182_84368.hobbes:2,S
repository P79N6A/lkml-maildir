Subject: 2.4.44-ac5 panic with ppa(ZIP) driver

I get a panic on bootup with the ppa driver compiled into
the kernel.
With ppa compiled as a module I get severak "bad: scheduling
while atomic!" errors during the modprobe, and then modprobe
exits with preempt_count 1 and a segfault error.
Strangely, even after all the horrible error messages the
ZIP disk actually works, as long as ppa is a module.
I'm running debian/testing with modprobe version 2.4.19
and gcc 2.95.4 20011002.
