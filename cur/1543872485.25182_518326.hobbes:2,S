Run this:
root@localhost:~# dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
It should ask you if you want to run the X-server at a lower  
(higher?) nice level.
To decrease the minimum-debconf-priority for new package  
installations you can run this:
root@localhost:~# dpkg-reconfigure debconf
Change the "Ignore questions with a priority less than: " value to  
"medium" or "low".
Cheers,
