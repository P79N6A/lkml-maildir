The hardware and firmware require knowledge of the host memory layout. They
also use it. Right now I can't find a portable way to extract this information.
If you've got any suggestions I'd like to hear them.
Its even worse than it seems too because an IOMMU as in the AMD case changes
the rules in ways the board simply doesn't expect.
