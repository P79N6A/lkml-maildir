No, devices declare the resources, but do not mark them as busy.
Otherwise any further attempt to request them would fail, which isn't
the case.

The driver isn't deleting the resources, it is marking them as no longer
busy.
We can't seem to agree on this point. Can someone else who is familiar
with the new resource model please shed some light?

That we agree on.

Good point, I had missed that fact. However, I've now checked all the
callers and found that they all call platform_device_put() right after
platform_device_del(), so we're safe. And they have to, otherwise their
code is broken. It's always in an error path, as this appears to the
only legitimate use for platform_device_del(). So I really don't see
the benefit of taking an additional reference in platform_device_del
"just in case". If it ever makes a difference, it means the caller code
is badly broken anyway, so why bother?
platform_device_put has the following comment: "This function must
_only_ be externally called in error cases.  All other usage is a bug."
As I understand it, we could/should add this to platform_device_del
too, to discourage the bogus use cases you fear could happen. Hence an
updated patch:
* * * * *
In platform_device_del(), we currently delete the device resources
first, then we delete the device itself. This causes a (minor) bug to
occur when one unregisters a platform device before unregistering its
platform driver, and the driver is requesting (in .probe()) and
releasing (in .remove()) a resource of the device. The device
resources are already gone by the time the driver gets the chance to
release the resources it had been requesting, causing an error like:
Trying to free nonexistent resource <0000000000000295-0000000000000296>
If the platform driver is unregistered first, the problem doesn't
occur, as the driver will have the opportunity to release the
resources it had requested before the device resources themselves are
released. It's a bit odd that unregistering the driver first or the
device first doesn't lead to the same result.
So I believe that we should delete the device first in
platform_device_del(). I've searched the git history and found that it
used to be the case before 2.6.8, but was changed here:

However we now have an explicit call to put_device() at the end of
platform_device_unregister() so I guess the original problem no longer
exists and it is safe to revert that change.
