So you can do whatever you want with it.

This is true. This is called ipqmpd or something similar and written by
Harald Welte, yes?
Your best option is to either check out libipq (can be found in the
directory of the same name in the iptables sources), which provides
clean C interfaces, or the PERL interface, available from
http://www.intercode.com.au/jamesm/

It can modify and then reinject the packet if it so wishes.

It just does more stuff. A plane is far more complex than a car, but
with an added feature - it also flies above the ground.
