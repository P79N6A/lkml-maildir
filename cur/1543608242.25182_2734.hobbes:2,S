I think that bumping a u64 is actually faster.  We have to remember that
this code is executed every 10 ms.  It is not in a loop.  This means
that the chance of branch prediction being available is nil.  In this
case the processor will predict the branch as not taken and be wrong
(except for once every 1.3 years). 
On the other hand, the u64 bump has no branches, just an add carry. 
This amounts to 1 add carry each bump (assuming we can get cc to do the
add carry to memory) and no branches to predict.  We should also take
care to put the u64 in one cache line, of course.
