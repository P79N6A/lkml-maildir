Hello People,
i have found some wrong thing in include/linux/version.h
On my System i have Kernel 2.6.0-test10 & 2.6.0-test11, but in
include/linux/version.h i see:
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.6.0-test9"
correct where:
#definde UTS_RELEASE "2.6.0-test11" (for Linux Kernel 2.6.0-test11)...
Here is a little "patch":
diff -Nru linux-2.6.0-test11/include/linux/version.h linux-2.6.0-test11-fixed/include/linux/version.h
--- linux-2.6.0-test11/include/linux/version.h	Tue Dec  2 19:21:22 2003
+++ linux-2.6.0-test11-fixed/include/linux/version.h	Tue Dec  2 19:22:06 2003
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
-#define UTS_RELEASE "2.6.0-test9"
+#define UTS_RELEASE "2.6.0-test11"
 #define LINUX_VERSION_CODE 132608
 #define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) << 16) + ((b) << 8) + (c))
I know that this is not a very usefull fix, but i think 2.6.0 should be
BugFree (TM) :-)
Greeting Betz Stefan
