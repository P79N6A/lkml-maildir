Please note that there is *no* code doing any read-ahead there, which 
could be removed.
There is just setting and passing around of the lv_read_ahead field, 
without actually any
*results*. OK?

Thank you for explaining this issue. It appears then that the comments 
there are a bit missguiding.
I didn't look into the lvm user land code indeed. And the isn't even 
#ifdef __KERNEL__  stuff
in lvm.h. Of course you are right, that one just should remove the code 
and leave the layout
of the structure alone.
