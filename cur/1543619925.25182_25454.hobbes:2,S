I would have to agree with this comment.  Hybrid-ircd deals with poll()
and /dev/poll just fine.  We have attempted to make it use rtsig, but it
just doesn't seem to agree with the i/o model we are using, which btw, is
the same model that Squid (is/will be?) using.  I haven't played with
/dev/epoll yet, but I pray it is nothing like rtsig.
Basically what we need is, something like poll() but not so nasty.
/dev/poll is okay, but its a hack.  The best thing I've seen so far, but
it too seems to take the idea so far is FreeBSD's kqueue stuff(which
Hybrid-ircd handles quite nicely).
