1) Because Linux had long time HZ=100 hardcoded (except on Alphas) and
   lots of applications probably use that value today (as HZ in their
   source and not sysconf(...))  - especially since 2.4 (at least most
   of them) has HZ=100 except for 64bit CPUs).
2) There are patches which dynamically change the CPU speed. And it
   probably (IMHO) makes sense to change HZ dynamically too in that
   situations. And a over-time changing HZ value is useless in
   user-space.
