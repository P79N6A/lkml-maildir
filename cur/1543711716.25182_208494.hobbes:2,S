How do you insert yourself before the first page fault to do the COW, from 
userspace (open+mmap)? You can obviously hook mmap(2) and if a PROT_WRITE 
is requested, you COW from there. But then you have an whole bunch of new 
problems (again, when done from userspace) because, just to begin with, 
you need a stateful interception layer (while fl-cow for example is stateless).
In my modest usage scenario for my fl-cow shell (emacs+patch+diff+gcc) 
I've found that when something opens in RDWR, it really writes the file at 
some point during the opened session. So moving the COW down in the write 
path helps little or nothing. There may be as well other use cases where 
applications do frequently open in RDWR even w/out ever touching the file.
