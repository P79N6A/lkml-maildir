I would think that (really) updating atime on open would be enough, 
hopefully without being too much. The "lazyatime" thing I was playing 
with only updated on open, final close, write, and fork.
I like the idea of updating once in a while, but one of the benefits of 
noatime is allowing drives to spin down via inactivity. If something 
does get done in the area of less but non-zero atime tracking, perhaps 
that could be taken into account. I have to check what "laptop_mode 
actually does, since my laptops are old installs.
