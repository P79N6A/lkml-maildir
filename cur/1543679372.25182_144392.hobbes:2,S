Hi Alan,
   		Thanks for the Reply. Using multiple instances of driver, which inturn
causes the kernel to closes the driver when the application dies is the
approach we
have planned to go about.
Thanks Again

If the application has files open then your device will receive flush
events (and/or release events if its the last open) for each file handle
as it is closed. Linux drivers dont normally care about process exit
information in the general case therefore since the OS will ensure
drivers get told when handles are cleaned up
