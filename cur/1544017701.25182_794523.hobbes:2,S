Correct, include/linux/swab.h must stay as it provides the actual implementation
for the endian helpers cpu_to_le16, etc.  But now that I've gotten all of this
split out of byteorder.h, we can hide all of the arch overrides by wrapping
the include of asm/swab.h in ifdef __KERNEL__ and unexporting it.  That would
mean userpsace only gets the open-coded C versions and no inline asm from arch
overrides.
So, there wouldn't be any breakage, just possibly pessimization of generated
code if the compiler won't generate the optimized byteswaps on that arch.
