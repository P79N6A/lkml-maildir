Please can you describe your "intuitive solution" using FUTEX_FD more clearly?
I don't quite understand what you wrote, but there are flaws(*) in the
current FUTEX_FD implementation which I would like to fix anyway.
Perhaps we can improve async futexes in a way which is useful for you?
Thanks,

(*) FUTEX_FD cannot be used as a drop-in replacement for synchronous
futexes, due to a race condition in cancellation.
