Not sure if posting to the newsgroup linux.kernel sends
it to the mailing list too.

I think that this feature is very important. In an embedded system
using an NFS root filesystem, we found that the file cache
would take a lot of memory and all insmods would fail. This is
especially true when the system boots up and looks for /lib/modules.
I think it should be possible to modify the slab allocator to
implement a memory pool. We could add a flag which would prevent
the slab from growing beyond its initial size.
This approach would work only if the cache is allocated by
using the slab allocator.
