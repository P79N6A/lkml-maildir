Status in problem is being debugged. I have posted some infrastructure
patches that should allow Bryan to fix his driver cleanly.  
I did not cause this. The ipath HTX card driver's irq handling has
never been anything but a hack.  It has never worked correctly even in
the instances it worked.  It only worked on i386 or x86_64 when
CONFIG_PCI_MSI was enabled but did not use MSI.  It was relying on the
implementation detail that the architecture specific vector number was
placed in the dev->irq.  dev->irq is actually meaningless on this card
as it doesn't have any ordinary pci interrupts.
So while I am happy to take credit for flushing this bug out I did not
introduce it.
