I think the ideal in this case would be to have both threads on one cpu, 
with the other app on the other cpu.  This gives inter-process fairness 
while minimizing the amount of task migration required.
More interesting is the case of three processes on a 2-cpu system.  Do 
we constantly migrate one of them back and forth to ensure that each of 
them gets 66% of a cpu?
