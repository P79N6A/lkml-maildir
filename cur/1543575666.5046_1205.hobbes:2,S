I don't know if /dev/ttyUSBX would work, but I think it would.  People
have successfully run consoles through the usb-serial drivers, but I'm
not sure if the oops main console requires something different (like
registering itself actually as a console?)
And then there's the nice problem of the fact that if the oops comes
from the USB code, you will not see it come out the usb-serial driver :)
Let me know if you try this, and have any success (or find that it
doesn't work.)
thanks,
