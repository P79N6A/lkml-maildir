Some more information - stripe unit on the dm raid0 is 512k.
I have not attempted to increase I/O sizes at all yet - these test are
just demonstrating efficiency improvements in the filesystem.
These numbers for 32GB files.

Throughput in MB/s.
Consistent improvement across the write results, first time
I've hit the limits of the PCI-X bus with a single buffered
I/O thread doing either reads or writes.
Cheers,
