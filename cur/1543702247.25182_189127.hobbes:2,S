It sounds like just having the device node around will not cause the
rescan if you access it.  I don't have any such devices here to test
this out or not.  If true, having udev create all nodes will not help
out much :(

Oh I know, it's one of the first things I disable when setting up a box :)

Based on the previous info, I think we are stuck with probing :(

Hm, that would be nice.  I don't remember seeing it being proposed
before, what are the main complaints people have with this?
