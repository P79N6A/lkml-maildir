Hi Keith,
Few thoughts. So there are two things there.
- Create a common infrastructure which can be used by various RAS
  tools and common functionality is not duplicated. For ex. functionality
  for stopping cpus, saving register states etc.
- Create a infrastructure so that user can enforce the policy regarding
  in what order various RAS tools should run.
Last time patches did more of first thing. It had put lots of code
and the only user of that code was kexec/kdump. Sometime motivation level
is low regarding why to put so much of infrastructure code in if there
are no users and it can potentially bring down the reliability of kdump.

Agreed. It would be great if during next posting one can also post the
patches for exporting the policy decision to user space.
Having said that, who do you think are potential RAS tools among
which a user has to make a choice while determining the order. I
can think of only two. Crash dump and debugger.

I have got some concerns here and that's what precisely the core
point where this mail thread started. What does one do with die
notifier and panic notifer list? Should RAS tools like debugger
and crash dumpers register on this list and wait for their turn
to execute?
There are many other in kernel users who register on die or panic
notifier list. Like heartbeat, IPMI,..... Given the fact that
these symbols are exported, there will be proprietary users also
for whom we never get a chance to see their code.
Can one really trust all these users and let them run before
any RAS tool gets the control? After the kernel crash, there
is no gurantee regarding how many of these actions can be
successfully completed. Probably in case of in kernel debuggers
one can afford to do that but I think in case of kdump one
should not as all these actions can be reliably performed
in second kernel.
To sum up, couple of options come to mind.
- Register all the RAS tools on die notifier and panic
  notifier lists with fairly high priority. Export list
  of RAS tools to user space and allow users to decide the
  order of execution and priority of RAS tools.
- Create a separate RAS tool notifier list (ras_tool_notifer_list).
  All the RAS tools register on this list. This list gets priority
  over die or panic notifier list. User decides the oder of execution
  of RAS tools. 
  Here assumption is that above list will not be exported to modules.
  All the RAS tools will be in kernel and they always get a priority
  to inspect an event.
What do others think?
Thanks
Vivek
