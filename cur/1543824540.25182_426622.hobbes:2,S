Now suppose this.
The kernel has to save the video memory contents somewhereto restore it after 
pressing Enter. This may swap something out. Whoops, swap is on that failed disk.
Or: lock the memory in advance, to avoid the use of swap. But this is not better 
than doing the same thing from a userspace application that shows a pop-up 
ballon with the contents of this oops. And it won't be affected by a disk 
failure, because it has everything already in memory.
