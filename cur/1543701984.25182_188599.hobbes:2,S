That was such a silly thing to do, here's a script that does it, along
with the udev rule to add to udev.rules for it.  It names your cdrom
Artist_Title, and creates a symlink called cdrom that points to it, just
to be a tiny bit sane :)
I had been saying for a long time that you could have udev make a query
across the network to get a device name, this provides the perfect
example of just that...
thanks,

# a horribly funny script that shows how flexible udev can really be
# This is to be executed by udev with the following rules:
