Hi All,
  I see this error repeatedly.  Running Debian latest stable branch w/
custom 2.6.13.1 kernel.  I've got the racoon package installed and I'm
running IPSec between two such gateways.  On both ends, when I start Racoon
for my IPSec link I always get the following error:
###################################################

It doesn't seem to be fatal, but I figured I'd report it since it seems to
be continuous.  Syslog gives only the following:
Sep 20 00:58:53 localhost kernel: crc32c: Unknown symbol crc32c_le
I hope this problem isn't considered too trivial to report...sorry if I'm
wasting your time with it.
