Real problem, wrong fix. You just killed 3c509 EISA support
altogether. Could you please test the following patch (against latest
bk) :

This is not pretty either, but 3c579 probing will work, and in your
case it won't leave a dangling directory in sysfs.

Modprobing is perfectly OK, and indeed everything has been probed at
this stage. But having built-in drivers raises a few different
problems (the driver may be initialized before all busses are probed).

If you want to get back to the 2.4 state, where every single EISA
driver reinvents EISA probing, fair enough. I think 2.6 has it mostly
right (at least, it respects the bus hierarchy, which is necessary to
set futile things like dma_mask correctly). Drivers may be broken
(does hp100 rings a bell ?), but the framework looks sane to me.
Again, if you have something better to offer, I'm all ears.
