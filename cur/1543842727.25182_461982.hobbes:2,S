Actually i686 does now (since Jeremy's patches). The patch was for i386.
x86_64 doesn't need it.
But enough blame game. The "fault" in my original mail wasn't completely
serious anyways ...

Well, just getting the new unwinder to work in lockdep was a nightmare
too (most of the problems I had with that were on i386, not x86-64) 
Just look at the number of patches that were needed for it.

I disagree with that.  The nightmare is putting stuff that needs so much
infrastructure into the most basic operations.

Agreed it is :). But it was the quickest way to fix it.

You need the latest x86_64 patch (or latest mm) and enable lockdep
on i386. Possibly with some more interdependencies, but I hope not.
I guess a cleaner way would to set the global variable that turns
the tracing off during boot and then enable it when it starts making
sense. Not 100% sure where that point is.
