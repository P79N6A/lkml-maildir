Slackware has run stock kernels in some releases. Whenever possible I
prefer to run a stock kernel, since I can then avoid finding out that an
application isn't portable after all :-( Done that, didn't polish my
reputation or improve my disposition.
I would say that very few normal users are running applications so close
to the cutting edge that they need kernel patches to make them work.
