Would it help?  It seems to me that typically, your busiest, best-
connected routes are the ones where you could derive the most benefit
from ECN -- and those same routes are where you are likely to find the
most anti-ECN firewalls.
In other words, being able to just turn on ECN for localhost and your
internal network isn't likely to be terribly useful.
