3) You have a four year old machine - one day the RAID controller dies.
   The company that produced it has been acquired by someone else, and
   the product is no longer availble.  Can you get a new adapter with
   firmware that can actually read your disks?   Or are your data lost?
   Can you find a replacement controller on e-bay?  And would you want
   to?
Anyway, not wanting to spread more FUD than stricly necessary: It's a
matter of cost/benefit and risk management.   Everyone has their
personal preferences on this - and even if it wasn't so, let's not
begin to pretend that there is a simple answer to what's "best".
