I think I fixed.
It's not a problem of tmpfs. It's a permissions issue.
This:
tmpfs   /tmp   tmpfs     size=256m,noexec,nosuid,nodev      0 0
...gives the "can't allocate memory" message.
Doing:
# mount -o remount,exec /tmp
# /etc/init/vmware restart
Gives a working vmware (I've tried 2.6.9-rc2-mm1-VP-S2)
# mount | grep \ /tmp
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,size=256m)
Now, why the hell does vmware want exec permission on /tmp, only vmware devs 
know :(
Thanks everyone,
Norberto
