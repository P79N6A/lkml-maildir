Ok, I run an RH 5.2 installation with the 2.2.0-preX kernel and System.map
in the root directory.  The 'ps' utility apparently checks /boot first and
uses the (incorrect) System.map from RedHat's 2.0.x kernel.  If both
system maps are in /boot it's smart enough to grab the correct one,
though.  Thanks for the feedback!
