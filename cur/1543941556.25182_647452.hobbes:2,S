And therein lies the problem.  The original submittor omitted relevant 
maintainers, you followed that [incorrect] example, and the end result 
was clear:  an obviously wrong change.
Thus, the problem is precisely what you stated:  you did not bother to 
search for people who care about that file.

Hardly.  What part of "this change requires knowledge of the hardware" 
is difficult to understand?
And if you do not have that knowledge, why is it so trying to CC people 
who actively maintain a driver, and have that knowledge?
It's simple common sense to -ask- or at least -notify- in such cases.
That the original submittor made the same mistake is no reason to repeat 
the mistake.

That's a long list of excuses in an attempt to ignore the facts:
Fact 1:  The driver you modified is actively maintained
Fact 2:  The driver maintainer has respectfully indicated, through the 
standard community mechanism, the useful points of contact.
Fact 3:  The MAINTAINERS entry is correct and up-to-date.
Fact 4:  Even if you wanted to ignore MAINTAINERS, 'git log' on the 
relevant file could have told you who are useful parties to CC.
It's just common courtesy to CC a driver maintainer, ESPECIALLY when a 
change requires knowledge of the driver/hardware in question.

Because the change required knowledge not only of PCI, but of the 
hardware in question.  As your patch demonstrated.
And yes -- the original changes should have been CC'd to interested 
parties as well.  I'm still waiting to hear back from Alan or Bart 
whether the ATA/IDE changes in that PCI pile actually work...  the 
original changeset even noted that relevant parties had not yet been 
queried.
