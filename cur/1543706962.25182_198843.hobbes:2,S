| Linus Torvalds pointed the way of Tux :
| In short: the kernel talks bytestreams, and that implies that if you 
| want to talk to the kernel, you HAVE TO USE UTF-8.
In that case :
- should the kernel allow apps to write filenames that are invalid 
  UTF-8 and will crash UTF-8 apps ?
- should this UTF-8 rule be noted somewhere (in a FAQ/man page/LSB spec/
whatever) so apps authors know they are supposed to read and write UTF-8
filenames and not apply locale rules to kernel objects ?
- what happens to already existing invalid UTF-8 filenames ? Should the
kernel forcibly rewrite them (in 2.7.0...) to remove legacy mess ? What
should happen if someone plug an unconverted FS in such a system
afterwards ?
These are the questions people have been asking.
