And an daemon does the work, so if the machine is overloaded or chashes the
above just isn't done. "We support XXX, as long as we have shiny weather"
isn't enough.

Nope, I've been told over and over again that it is handled, but it
isn't. You said it again: Persistence is _not_ handled.

And how does each device get addressed inside the kernel then? The
major/minor stuff used to be an array for major, and each driver (indexed
by major) decides how to handle minor. Not a minor change to the kernel in
my book.
> you've been told this already.
Again, I've been told that this is solved, and the solution you outline is
massive work, yet to be done, in the kernel. Work that will have to be done
to solve the problem of huge numbers of devices anyway.

Great! And if I move the disk from one controller to the other, or switch
it around on the chain (or change its SCSI target in some other way) it
changes name. So names aren't persistent after all... and if the driver
does know where the disk sits, it could just as well export that knowledge
through the major/minor it reacts to. No dynamics required at all, probably
much simpler than the current scheme.
> this has been stated already.
Yes, but you are just changing one set of names, which has flaws (the
device renaming problem) with another with flaws that are equally serious
(devices get renamed when moved). In _both_ cases devices get renamed. In
the /dev/sdX case, when you remove devices, but not always when devices
move. In the /dev/cXtYdZsW case, they get renamed when devices move, but
not when devices get deleted. In the case of a PC, if you change your SCSI
adapter, it will probably now be somewhere else, so just changing the
controller will move your disks. This is deadly, so the sdX scheme is a bit
better there than the cXtYdZdW scheme. Both are bad, both can be done
without fancy dynamics. A kludge around this is mounting by label, which is
closer to what you really want: You want to mount whereever /tmp used to
be, the physical platter that is. That the device is now called
/dev/c15t13d5s117 is irrelevant, as it was yesterday when it was
/dev/sdf14. Device names are just convenient handles to device contents,
packaged up in a way easy for the operating system to export, and simple to
handle with standard tools for the userland.  Just like you don't care much
about the inode of your .bashrc, forget this silly naming game.

Because constructive arguments do have to include "This can't work. Better
look for another way to get there." somewhere.
