The driver doesn't map any of the ->priv structure, the comment in the
code is a left over from when it did. The priv strcture just has
pointers to the memory areas (which are kmalloc'ed and mapped). 
I should probably change the allocations to pci_alloc_consistent 
from their current map_single as well. 
All other comments taken on board, will be included in the next
update.

Thanks, these things do get a little easier each time you do one (esp.
once you've figured out which planet the hardware designers and tech
doc writers live on :)
