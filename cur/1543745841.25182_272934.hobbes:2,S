I will pretty much guarantee that if you put the per-thread patches next
to some abomination with per-cpu allocation for each mm, the choice will
be clear. Especially if the per-cpu/per-mm thing tries to avoid false
cacheline sharing, which sounds really "interesting" in itself.
And without the cacheline sharing avoidance, what's the point of this 
again? It sure wasn't to make the code simpler. It was about performance 
and scalability.
