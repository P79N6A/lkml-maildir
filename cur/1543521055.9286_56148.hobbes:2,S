I'm going from (potentially flaky) memory here, so don't
torch me too bad if I get something wrong. I don't remember
the address boundaries exactly, but I think Solaris
uses the following memory layout:
	0-end_text		program text
	end_text-???		heap (or brk(), whatever you want
				to call it)
	???-stack_start		mmap area, including dynamic
				libs, growing down
	stack_start-2GB		stack - usually a fixed size considerably
				smaller than 1GB
	2GB-4GB			kernel - inaccessible to user mode
stack size is configurable using certain compiler/linker options,
but there is essentially a 2GB vm limit per process. This has
probably changed since the 64 bit chips have come out, but I haven't
had the same level of experience with them that I had with the
32 bit architecture - I would assume that they used a fairly similar
model. That layout seems to provide a little more flexibility in
the balance between mmap/heap areas, although a badly fragmented
heap could still potentially interfere with mmap-ing.
I agree the (seemingly arbitrary?) 1GB/2GB/1GB split could
probably be improved on quite a bit, but I have no idea how
much work that would entail... I suspect quite a lot...
Then again, maybe there are completely valid reasons for
the current state of affairs that I'm not aware of (actually,
I'd almost bet on that...).
