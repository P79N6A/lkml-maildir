Agreed.

...looking at nf_ct_ext_create() you do:
         *ext = kzalloc(real_len, gfp);
                        ^^^^^^^^
         if (!*ext)
                 return NULL;
         (*ext)->offset[id] = off;
         (*ext)->len = len;
         (*ext)->real_len = real_len;
                            ^^^^^^^^
You are storing the _object size_ (total amount of memory requested) and 
not the _buffer size_ (total amount of memory allocated). Keep in mind 
that object size < buffer size and that ksize() returns the latter.
Now continuing in __nf_ct_ext_add() you do:
        if (newlen >= ct->ext->real_len) {
                               ^^^^^^^^
                 new = kmalloc(newlen, gfp);
                 if (!new)
                         return NULL;
So you're comparing newlen to the object size and not the buffer size 
which is what you want and what ksize() and consequently my patch does.
Take a look at mm/util.c::krealloc(). It does exactly what you want 
modulo the RCU bits. My patch converts the netfilter code to follow the 
exact same semantics.
