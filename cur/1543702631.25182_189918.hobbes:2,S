hi!
as mentioned in this thread
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107330398724534&w=2) a
few days ago, christophe saout wrote: "LABEL= is a RedHat extension.
Please use the normal root options that is described in the Grub or
kernel documentation."
rik van riel mentioned: "It's not even a Red Hat extension.  The LABEL=
stuff is done entirely in userspace, on the initrd.
If you do not want to use an initrd, you need to use the normal root
options instead, something like root=/dev/hda3" that thread also offers
some information to the problem."
have you created an initrd? if not, comment that line out of your grub
config.
you can leave your fstab like it is, using labels in fstab is ok.
