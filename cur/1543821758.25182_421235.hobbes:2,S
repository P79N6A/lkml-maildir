True.

I can't disclose that.  There are several Linux phones availiable,
mostly in Asia though.  I have actually seen some of the GSM Linux
phones in use in the US.  I suppose they ought to work in Europe. 
Some are very nice.  I would suggest for a kernel hacker to make sure
you get one that you can telnet into or get terminal app on.  There is
something disappointing about a Linux machine of any kind without a
proper shell. :)
