Yes. I will do that. I am planning to add "nobh" support to
ext3 ordered mode also, since its the default one. We need
to modify generic interfaces like mpage_writepage(s) to
keep track of bio count and make journal code wait for them etc. -
at that point the "generic" code will no longer be generic.
I am thinking of a way to do it *less* intrusively. 
At that point, we can make "nobh" default option. (which
needs less documentation).

The initial numbers showed 5-7% throughput improvements. I will send out
resource consumption numbers once I complete my regression tests.
Yep. I will update the changelog also.
Thanks,
