Done.

Result is:
root@amd:/data/l/linux-mm/drivers/pci/hotplug# insmod acpiphp.ko debug=1
insmod: error inserting 'acpiphp.ko': -1 No such device
root@amd:/data/l/linux-mm/drivers/pci/hotplug# dmesg | tail -3
Failure of coda_cnode_make for root: error -19
acpiphp: ACPI Hot Plug PCI Controller Driver version: 0.5
acpiphp_glue: Total 0 slots
root@amd:/data/l/linux-mm/drivers/pci/hotplug#
Should I have CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI_IBM set?
