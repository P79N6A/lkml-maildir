FYI: I merged the PPS nanokernel stuff from Linux-2.2.1 to 2.2.5 
yesterday. The resulting diff against 2.2.5 can be found at
linux.kernel.org /pub/daemons/ntp/PPS (I think) and
ftp://pcphy4.physik.uni-regensburg.de/pub/wiu09524/PPS
Again, it should work better than the last one, and in fact it´s a 
release candidate after my vacation. (I'm on vacation)
Regards,
Ulrich
