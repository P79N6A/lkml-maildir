Hello Wim,

Good I will check. I have one test machine provided by Asus, Winbond and me :)
(I'm using it for lm-sensors stuff) I can give you access if you give me ssh key.

Ah correct, not always updated via async event, maybe the register is to be
polled only.

If you mean in watchdog class, the yes. Otherwise no. The hwmon class has well
defined interface for a while...

Ok.

Ok I will look into your code.

I will let you know when I'm done with the studying of your code. I hope that I
will have some time in near fututure, got lot of stuff to do.
