The problem appears to be that the uart driver is not assigning the
port.  In uart_get() located in drivers/serial/serial_core.c the code
tries to access state->port but it does not appear to exist.  Where is
the port supposed to get added/setup?  Should this happen in the driver
init or does the kernel add the ports to the driver after init?
Uart_get knows the correct driver name drv->driver_name = "PXA serial"
and drv->dev_name = "ttyS", but the drv->state->port does not exist.
Where should the port be added?  The port info exists in
drivers/serial/pxa.c but I cant find where its initialized.  Any help
would be great.
Thanks,
Tom

Hi;
The errno "-6" is defined as:
#define ENXIO            6      /* No such device or address*/
You can try to retrieve the rootfs and add the necessary device file
to it, then reflash the rootfs.
I'm Sorry, I  have no embedded environment to test.
Regards
dave
