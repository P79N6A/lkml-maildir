Since there are only a couple, I didn't get exotic.

Didn't think of it, to be honest, and I can't find any reference to
link-once glancing through the ld info page.
You'll still have problems with objects linked into two modules
(ip_conntrack_core being the typical one), but we could ban these and
just #include the .c file rather than linking.
Really, the number of modules which do this is so small, the code to
add init function to them is less than the change in the build system
to get tricky.
Rusty.
