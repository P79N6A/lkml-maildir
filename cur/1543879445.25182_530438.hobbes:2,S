Except your patch removes this hunk:
@@ -2264,14 +2248,6 @@ static int __init apm_init(void)
 		apm_info.disabled = 1;
 		return -ENODEV;
 	}
-	if (PM_IS_ACTIVE()) {
-		printk(KERN_NOTICE "apm: overridden by ACPI.\n");
-		apm_info.disabled = 1;
-		return -ENODEV;
-	}
-#ifdef CONFIG_PM_LEGACY
-	pm_active = 1;
-#endif
in apm.c and a similar piece of the ACPI initialisation that prevented
one initialising if the other had already initialised.
