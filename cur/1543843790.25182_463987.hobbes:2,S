Hi,

I completely agree with you under the condition that these alternatives 
were mutually exclusive or conflicting with each other.

Do we have a doctrine which forces us to design a feature in such way 
that has to be as difficult as possible to make it available to our users?
In this case it would be very easy to provide some basic functionality via 
static tracing and the full functionality via dynamic tracing. Where is 
the law that forbids this?

Comparing it to STREAMS is an insult and Ingo should be aware of this. :-(

All the controversy around static tracing in general and LTT in specific 
has prevented this so far...
