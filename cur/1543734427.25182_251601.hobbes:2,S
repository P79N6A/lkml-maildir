MONITOR+MWAIT works on SMP as well.

The instruction mwait is just a hint for the processor to enter an
(implementation-specific) optimized state, and in general it cannot
cause indefinite delays because of various break events, including
interrupts. If an interrupt happens, then the processor gets out of the
mwait state. The instruction does not support a restart at the mwait
instruction. In other words the processor needs to redo the mwait
instruction to reenter the state after a break event. Event time-outs
may take the processor out of the state, depending on the
implementation.

As I noted (and Linus suspected), monitor/mwait is not proper for
spinlocks on Prescott/Nocona because of high latencies.
