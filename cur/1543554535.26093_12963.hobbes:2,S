thanks for all those who replied. your help is really appreciated.
basically, in order to compile kernel in RH7, kgcc *MUST* be used instead of
gcc.
to use kgcc edit the Makefile. find the line below and change to:
CC =$(CROSS_COMPILE)kgcc <----(changed to kgcc instead of gcc/cc)
once again. thank you for those who helped :)
cheers!
