Alternatively, the same "fresh new Linux user" who just asked me why

Thankfully not my point. I have some reservations about devfs, but I
regard most of the arguments against it as being similar to the ones
that MicroSnot use to 'prove' that Linux is inferior to their
Graphically Useless Idiot-detector.
I can also add that the "I don't like that idea, so you're not allowed
to have/use it" mentality displayed by most of the anti-devfs brigade
bears a strong resemblance to the mentality adopted by Adolf Hitler
and his compatriots in the late 1930's and early 1940's, and deserves
similar treatment. Horst von Brand is one of the very few who display
anywhere near a rational argument against it, and Horst is the only
one so far where I've been able to follow his argument, so I have no
problem excluding him from the above description.
Best wishes from Riley.
