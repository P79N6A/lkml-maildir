OK :-).
But I learnt a lot here on the kernel.
Also found not to cut 'n' paste from nano in X.  It doesn't perserve tabs... 
so the patch was bum anyway.  I only found out it was fubar when I was 
looking at what Matt done to get the struct sizes on different vmlinuz 
builds, and cut and paste back into a file from the mail.
But here is the results anyway using my .config but with the option off and 
on:
Orig (off):
bash-2.05b# nm -t d -rS --size-sort linux-2.6.12orig/vmlinux | grep hwifs
0000003225966208 0000000000014080 B ide_hwifs
With the IDE selection option (but not EMBEDDED) with 2 IDE interfaces 
selected (on with 2):
bash-2.05b# nm -t d -rS --size-sort linux-2.6.12/vmlinux | grep hwifs
0000003225974400 0000000000002816 B ide_hwifs
