All-
	Sorry for the newbie-ish question, but today I installed the 2.4
test kernel with the following distributions:
	Caldera Linux Technology Preview
	Redhat 7.0 beta (pinstripe)
	Now, after install, I keep getting slammed with the following
errors:
	eth0 card reports no RX buffers
	eth0 card reports no resources
	Put it to say i am at a loss, here is the hardware:
	Compaq ML350
	Intel Dual 733
	512 meg ram
	Compaq NC3163 Fast Ethernet NIC (embedded) PCI 10/100 WOL (Wake On
LAN)
	Integrated ATI Rage IIC Video Controller with 4MB Video Memory
	9.1 GB Wide Ultra2 (7200 rpm) 1"
	Any pointers or help would be appreciated.
	-Jesse Noller
