Maybe not 4 billion files, but you can get a large number of >1 linked
files, when you copy full directories with "cp -rl".  Which I do a lot
when developing. I've done that a few times with the Linux tree.  Given
other utils that copy as hard links, can perhaps make a 4 billion number
of files with >1 link possible, and perhaps likely in the near future.
