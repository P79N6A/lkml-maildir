That's nice.
What I would like is for someone to maintain a set of
"required" patches to each new kernel --
"required" here meaning "these patches are needed for kernel
x.y.z to build or boot cleanly."
The patchsets would contain only compile/link fixes and
critical logic fixes to release and pre-release kernels.
This wouldn't be for me necessarily, as I already keep a
"fixes" email file, but I think that this could help
cut down on repeated emails on lkml about <2.5.19 has errors>
or "mounting a CD with ide-scsi crashes 2.5.11."
It could help developers, users, and testers get going
quickly.
