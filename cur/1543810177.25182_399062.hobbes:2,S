How bad is it really? From what I saw marking that swsuspend2 branch
with "unlikely" should help the hot path.

Many of Pavel's arguments are not about performance tradeoffs but
about perceived complexity of the code. I think if Nigel could run a
clean up on his implementation and split it into couple of largish
(not for inclusion but for general overview) pieces, like separate
arch support, generally useful bits and the rest it would allow seeing
more clearly how big and invasive swsuspend2 core is.
