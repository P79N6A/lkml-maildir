Dear, Linux developers,
I was surprised to find that there are "find_{first,next}_zero_bit"
functions, but there are not any "find_{first,next}_set_bit" functions.
I am offering a not very good version of find_next_set_bit function
attached. I have tested it for all cases I could think of, so I hope has
not many bugs. It is of course open source and as far as it is nothing
much, you may add my e-mail and name if you need a maintainer, otherwise
you may omit these.
Have a nice maintaining,
Pavel M. Penev.[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
