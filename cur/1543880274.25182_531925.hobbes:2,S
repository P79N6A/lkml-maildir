It seems easy enough that there is no point accepting unfair
behaviour like the old scheduler if we're going to go to all
this trouble to replace it. The old scheduler seems to have
bounded unfairness and bounded starvation, so let the good times
roll.

I don't refuse. I'm talking about per-process CPU time fairness.
My paragraph above was pointing out that subsequent work to
add other classes of fairness are not excluded as configurable
features, but this basic type of fairness should be included.

You misunderstand me. There is no single "optimal" when you're talking
about fairness (or most other scheduler things). So pondering whether
fairness is optimal or not doesn't really make sense.
I'm saying it should be a basic axiom, not that it is quantitively
better. It isn't a refutable argument. I state it because that it is
what users and programs expect.
You can reject that, and fine. I guess if a scheduler comes along that
does exactly the right thing for everyone, then it is better than any
fair scheduler. So OK, while we're talking theoretical, I won't dismiss
an unfair scheduler out of hand.

So that might be a nice addition, but the base funcionality is threads
simply because that's what we've always done. Just common sense.
