When we shifted syntax for the kernel configuration people di
not complain about compatibility with 2.4. Why not?
Because it is trivial to maintain two simple files with different
namings:
Config.in for 2.4
Kconfig for 2.5
For the Makefiles we have seen a slow shift in syntax, with more and
more being deprecated. So it is becoming a bit annoying to
maintain 2.4 and 2.5 compatibility in the same file.
Idea:
In 2.5 introduce a new default filename for kbuild Makefiles:
	Kmakefile
Then a driver would have: 
2.4	Config.help, Config.in and Makefile
2.5	Kconfig and Kmakefile
This would also allow us to do some simplification of the top-level
Makefile by moving the last steps of building vmlinux out to a seperate
Kmakefile - but this is added bonus, the real driver for this change
would be less hassle for 2.4/2.5 compatbility.
Comments?

The patch is trivial.
