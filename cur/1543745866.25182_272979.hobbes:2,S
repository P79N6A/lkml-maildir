So an app running through wine could set TF on it's own?  It would be a 
good idea to find out what it is doing in the first place.  There has to be
a reason why War3 is so picky after the original change was introduced and
a reason why the latest changes don't seem to fix it. 
I've built a kernel 2.6.10-rc2 with the new ptrace patch.  The program still
says "please insert disc".  I haven't been able to get winedbg to tell me 
anything useful -- the program never crashes anyways.  So I went ahead and I 
captured a debug log.
the command:
WINEDEBUG=+all wine war3/Warcraft\ III.exe -opengl >& war3_and_2.6.10-rc2.log
I scanned for the part right before it calls up to display the error.  I found
that after loading advapi32.dll, the thread 000c creates a mutex and wakes up
000a.  Then 000c gets killed and right after that starts calling up the 
resources for the "insert disc" message box.  I put the log up on my ftp, and 
the interesting part in a seperate file:
ftp://resnet.dnip.net/
Any clue on what may be happening here?  Or maybe another idea on where else to search?
