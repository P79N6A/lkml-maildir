If ever there was something which was screaming for an open source project,
it's spam filtering.  It seems like every major mailing list has someone
like Matti, working really hard on a thankless task, but losing out under
the tide of new spam every day.  Seems to me if there was a public repository
(sourceforge, bkbits, whatever) with a collection of procmail filters which
have been shown to work correctly, that would be a win.
