Do you mount the usb disk with the "sync" option? 
I can confirm the low performance (few KB/s instead of 5 MB/s with Kernel 
2.6.11) when I mount with "sync". 
 
Without "sync" the performance seems to be fine although it is dangerous since 
it is a removable media. 
 
2.6.11 does not show this behavior.
