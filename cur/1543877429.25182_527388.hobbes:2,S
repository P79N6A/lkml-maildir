Well, my latest set of patches replaced a struct cpuset pointer with a
struct container_group pointer - so no net increase there.

Agreed - I think that it is technically possible, with a bunch of
changes to nsproxy to support this.

Agreed, it's worth thinking about it - but reimplementing/renaming the
whole set of patches just to change container_group to nsproxy seems a
bit extreme.
I'd much rather get something that works with container_group, and
then work with the folks who have a lot invested in nsproxy to see
about merging the two.

Or even short term, I think - although it won't hurt too much for
cases where a single process enters a container and all children stay
in the container, it'll hurt a lot in cases where you ever move the
contents of one container into another. (Possibly in an orthogonal
hierarchy).
BTW, what does rcfs do if a subsystem is registered when there are
already mounted hierarchies? It looks as though it leaves the relevant
pointers as NULLs.

You're right, I missed that, sorry.

True - but it is one that I think needs to be addressed.

I think you're only right if you're going to overload the nsproxy
count field as the total refcount, rather than the number of tasks. If
you do that then you risk having to allocate way more memory than you
need in any routine that tries to allocate an array with one pointer
per task in the container (e.g. when reading the tasks file, or moving
a task into a new cpuset). My patch separates out the refcounts from
the tasks counts for exactly that reason - there's a per-subsys_state
refcount which can be cheaply manipulated via the subsystem. (I have a
version with lower locking requirements that I've not yet posted).

OK, but at that point you're basically back at my patches, but using
nsproxy rather than container_group.

It's still adding boilerplate (extra pointers, extra /proc files,
logic to hook them together) to every subsystem that needs this, that
could be avoided. But I guess this aspect of it isn't a huge issue.

The kernel wouldn't use it, other than to act as an inescapable task
grouping whose members could always be easily listed from userspace.
