Erik-
	Thank you so much for your idea.  Apparently, it is ACPI related, though I am
afraid I must disagree with you on the nature, at least in my case.  I disabled
the upper megabyte per your suggestion.  Now no ACPI functionality works.  My
ACPI table also includes a ACPI data and ACPI NVS region ( IOS-e820:
0000000000008000 @ 0000000007ff0000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000008000 @ 0000000007ff8000 (ACPI NVS)).
	My screen now does not power down, and the lockup is gone.
If anyone has any idea of what might be going on, please let me know (Erik may
be correct and I just have a little more screwiness).
