Why not a watcher process, if I may ask.  That is, I'd be tempted to
stash a copy of the daemon's executable, and in place of the original
executalbe put a piece of code that fork/exec'd the stashed copy, waited
for the exit, and notified you as need be.
The available operations on files in the /proc file system tend to
be a very limited subset of those on regular files; so I am not
surprised that F_NOTIFY didn't work.
