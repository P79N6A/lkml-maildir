Yeah you can increase /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to help the problem.
There is a possibly better solution in the -mm kernels which should get
merged into 2.6 sooner or later - but there is still no way to guarantee
safety from allocation failures. If they cause crashes then that is a
bug, so report them here with traces and a description of the workload
and system hardware, etc.
Thanks
