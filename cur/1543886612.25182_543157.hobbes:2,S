The fix below seems to work for the ATARI problem.
Do you want me to submit it properly, do you want to
submit it along with the other patches, or do you think
we should sit on things for a bit?

Subject: [PATCH] [IA64] ATARI_KBD_CORE only exists on m68k
ATARI_KBD_CORE doesn't exist on architectures other than m68k,
which causes the following warnings:
drivers/input/keyboard/Kconfig:170:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'KEYBOARD_ATARI' refers to undefined symbol 'ATARI_KBD_CORE'
drivers/input/mouse/Kconfig:181:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'MOUSE_ATARI' refers to undefined symbol 'ATARI_KBD_CORE'
By reversing the Kconfig logic, the same results should occur on
m68k as the current code, but the warnings go away on other platforms.
