Sorry, I just realized that I rejected your preemption explanation
without explaining why:
1 - In my "Text Section" lock code, which is the original place where I
triggered the problem, I take a spinlock around these operations, which
disables preemption.
2 - My sample module plays alone in its own data structures: there is
only one thread accessing the data at a given time (because I do only
one file open at a given time, which I control).
Regards,
Mathieu
