  Not really. I have found that 2.4 kernels are usefully stable if you
pick them carefully.

  Again, given the choice of the o/s failing every few months or not
using your hardware, where do you go? I haven't found a 2.2 kernel which
like running multiple NICs at 85% of max most of the time, while several
of the 2.4.kernels, most recently 2.4.6 will.

  A quick look at the c.o.l.development.system will show I said ages ago
that we should QA "stable" kernel releases before sending them out. I
offered to set up a group to do that for each release candidate, but
there was no interest.
  The VM work is really needed, but I wish the development was in "pre"
kernels, not releases. I've been playing while on vacation, and
2.4.9-ac14 looks much better, 2.4.9-ac16 has minor problems on a machine
I won't see until I "get back to work," and I haven't deceded if I want
to try 2.4.9-ac18 or not. Sadly, horror stories on 2.4.10 have suggested
that I let others try that.
  Given the load of totally new VM stuff dropped in, I admit I'd like to
see useful stuff which only takes effect if configured (the so-called
Athlon patch) in the kernel, since many systems simply will not run an
Athlon kernel without it. I only wish the preempt was being pushed as
hard as VM, it looks really good on loaded machines.
  Perhaps it's time for 2.5 indeed.
