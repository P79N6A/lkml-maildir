Er, it's in scsi_error.c:scsi_decide_disposition():
      maybe_retry:
	/* we requeue for retry because the error was retryable, and
	 * the request was not marked fast fail.  Note that above,
	 * even if the request is marked fast fail, we still requeue
	 * for queue congestion conditions (QUEUE_FULL or BUSY) */
	if ((++scmd->retries) <= scmd->allowed
	    && !blk_noretry_request(scmd->request)) {
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		return NEEDS_RETRY;
	} else {
		/*
		 * no more retries - report this one back to upper level.
		 */
		return SUCCESS;
	}
