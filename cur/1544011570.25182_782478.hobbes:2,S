Sure, but someone must have done dma_declare_coherent_memory() before
with a size smaller than it later passed to dma_alloc_coherent(), no?
I think we should add the check, WARN if it's true and return an
appropriate error number.  It will be handled gracefully then and we
still know which callsite screwed up.
