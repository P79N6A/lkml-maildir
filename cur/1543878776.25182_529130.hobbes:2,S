They can't. There is no proper API to do IOMMU mappings from user space.
And that is how Xorg on x86 works.
I had some hackish patches to enable mapping on /sys/bus/pci/.../coherent_mem, but
you need ioctls to pass out the translated address and it wasn't
exactly pretty. Still also not sure that's the right way.
