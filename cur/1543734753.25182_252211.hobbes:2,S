Subject: [PATCH] New QStor SATA/RAID Driver for 2.6.9-rc2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

My first attempt at posting this seems to have gone AWOL,
so here it comes again.  Also being posted to linux-scsi.
Here is the first public release of the 2.6.xx driver
source code for the Pacific Digital Corporation QStor SATA/RAID chip.
This 4-channel chip has hardware-assisted RAID0/RAID1/RAID10,
host-queuing, per-request TCQ/NCQ support, support for hot insertion
and removal of drives, etc..  The 64-bit/66Mhz chip shows throughput
in excess of 200MByte/sec on my ancient P3-1GHz test system,
and can do much better when installed in a PCI-X slot.
The driver (attached) supports most of the chip features,
including host, native and legacy tagged queuing,
but does not yet include boot-from-raid support (coming soon).
Both hdparm and smartmontools are fully supported by this driver.
This patch is against linux-2.6.9-rc2.
Please email me any errors or corrections you may deem necessary
for kernel inclusion.
