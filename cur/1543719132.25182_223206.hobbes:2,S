Win32 API has a FILE_ATTRIBTE_TEMPORARY to mark files which should be
prefered be served from buffercache, FIL_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING allows raw access
(required block boundary reads). FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS is used to hint the
cache (dont know what it does, maybe reduce prefetching?) as well als
FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN as a hint for the other case where you read the
stream. There is also a writethrough flag, which does not affect caching. So
basically I think the hints Win32 API offers are not the perfect set of
flags one can think about. Unless SEQUENTIAL_ACCESS implies also "forget
blocks vefore current read position".
