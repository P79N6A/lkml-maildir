I have a PPro 200/256k with 64M RAM running on SCSI disks that keeps
crashing.  I was fairly sure of bad RAM, but I removed the offending chips
and it crashed yet again.  What I see on the screen doesnt to my knowledge
look like an oops (and i cant scroll back).  What would I need to grab to
help make a determination as to what's wrong?
The box was installed with RedHat 6.1, and is running a stock 2.2.13.
AHA-2940U SCSI controller, Quantum Fireball sda, Seagate Hawk sdb, maxtor
hda, ide cdrom on hdb.  If there's any other useful info needed please let
me know.
\What it shows on the screen right now looks like a bunch of hex addresses.
Here's the last few lines.  If an OOPS or whatever else would be useful
would be dumped to a file somewhere, please let me know and i'll dig it up.
