You are entirely right :)
But argument for siblings vs. subcore is that in the context of the
processors displayed in /proc/cpuinfo known of them are "subscores" of
the other (and thus none of them are the "main core").
Some are just "siblings" in the same parent process package.  So given a
dual Xeon machine, you have 4 virtual processors, which are broken into
two sets of two siblings.  Those two sets are each part of the same
package.
