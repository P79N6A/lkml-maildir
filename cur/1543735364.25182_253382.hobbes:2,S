Absolutely, when you are in the source directory you can see how all this
is run, it's just a shell script.  Look in ../scripts/lmbench for lat_pipe
and run that.
In general, the code in LMbench is very very small and it's easy to tinker
with the system and add more tests.  I've been very surprised over the 
years that people haven't done so.
For what it is worth, we're looking at porting LMbench to Windows using 
the Unix API layer we did in BitKeeper.
