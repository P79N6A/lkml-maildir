Absolutely.
Think o fthe optimization as a way to give application writers a new way 
of being efficient.
In particular, I remember when the gcc people were worried about the most 
efficient way to read in a file for preprocessing (Neil Booth, mainly). 
Neil did all these timings on where the cut-off point was for using mmap 
vs just using read().
For people like that, wouldn't it be nice to just be able to tell them: if 
you do X, we guarantee that you'll get optimal zero-copy performance for 
reading a file.

Exactly.
