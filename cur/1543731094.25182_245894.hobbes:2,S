It has the problem that I have reported for 2.6.8.1-mm4, that after issuing:
# rmmod snd_seq_oss
the kernel goes into a strange state:
- one CPU (either CPU0 or CPU1) is 100% loaded with system load
- the other CPU is free
- the process "rmmod snd_seq_oss" is in the D+ state
- when I exit KDE session the system hangs solid (no way to get to it, reset 
necessary).
- when I try this from a virtual terminal, it freezes the keyboard and I can't 
get to the other virtual terminals/X, but I can get to the system via ssh.
No Oops is reported, and it does not happen on 2.6.8.1-mm2.

RJW
