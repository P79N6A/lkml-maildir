That is the whole point of page aging done right. The use of a page dictates
how it is aged before being discarded. So pages referenced once are aged
rapidly, but once they get touched a couple of times then you know they arent
streaming I/O. There are other related techniques like punishing pages that
are touched when streaming I/O is done to pages further down the same file -
FreeBSD does this one for example

Updatedb is a bit odd in that it mostly sucks in metadata and the buffer to
page cache balancing is a bit suspect IMHO.
