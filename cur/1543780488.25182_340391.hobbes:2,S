Mess with PageNosave (if that is what we used to denote a struct page
not pointing to valid RAM).
Ie. when swsusp allocates its save map (or whatever it calls it), setting
PageNosave would make other parts of the kernel think the area is not
valid ram.
In other words - we can't combine swsusp's PageNosave with our mythical
PageValidRAM.

In the short term, PageReserved can stay around - swsusp does still
work if I hadn't made that clear.
By the way - how does swsusp2 handle this problem if not using
PageReserved?
