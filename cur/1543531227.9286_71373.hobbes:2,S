I mean, give a process the memory it really occupies. If the process
is taking up 17345 pages of VM, give it 17345 pages of VM. Don't
pretend it is occupying 18990 pages just because it might expand
later. Remember: It has an almost infinite amount of stack allocated
already - do you want to include that as well?
