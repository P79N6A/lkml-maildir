I give users more credit in the curiosity/observation department.  In
my experience, when a user fires up his/her box, independent of OS,
they watch it pretty closely.  This behavior begins roughly the first
time they lose a chunk of work ;-)
Whether the boot process is graphic or text doesn't matter.. some will
watch it and some will ignore it.
If I were an employer, I'd feel a lot better about my staff if I walk
by and catch them staring blankly at cryptic text vs a splash screen.

Yup.  Distributors can add whatever whistles/bells that fit their needs.
