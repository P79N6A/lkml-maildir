Well, it was a guess. And a very wrong one too,it appeard later on.
After I posted the message and got no reaction,I tried some different 
kernel configs,and finally a very lean one.  No preempt,i386 only,no 
mtrr,no ide,no nfsroot. The idea was let the kernel boot,and then 
let it complain  it can't find a rootsystem. Even that wouldn't work.
Same symptoms. Loadlin unzapping kernel and than whush...black screen 
followed by reboot.
A very lean kernel >2.5.32 won't boot with loadlin on my system.
So no relation to nfsroot (my mistake).
So my GUESS is,it has something to do with the interaction between loadlin 
and the kernel.
