I've got a problem with loopback device.
The sequence of commands:
    # dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1k count=3000
    # mke2fs -q -F -N 600 -m 0 file 3000
    # mount -t ext2 -o loop file mnt.point
results in
VFS: Can't find an ext2 filesystem on dev loop(7,0).
    # losetup /dev/loop3 file
I have tried to attach the file to a loop device and compared the contents of
the file and what is seen through /dev/loop3: the bytes are different.  Did
I miss anything?  Please advise.
Thanks,
