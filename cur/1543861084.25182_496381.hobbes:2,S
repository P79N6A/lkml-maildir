Sorry, they didn't went in before 2.6.16.37-rc1, and except for 
releasing 2.6.16.37-rc1 unchanged as 2.6.16.37 I didn't work on 2.6.16 
during christmas and new year.
I've now applied all three patches.
There's already a CVE number for
"i386: save/restore eflags in context switch".
Are there also CVE numbers for the equivalent x86_64 patch and
"x86_64: fix ia32 syscall count"?
Thanks for your patches
Adrian
