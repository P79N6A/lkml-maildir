   Once again, thanks to people messing with the scsi layer, I'm forced to 
   attempt to fix this driver, which it seems I'm the only one using :)
The esp.c sources would be a better basis for writing a driver to
drive this chip, BTW.
qlogicfas.c is rarely if ever used (as you contend) and doesn't work
at all in the rare case we know it is used (as you also contend :-)
