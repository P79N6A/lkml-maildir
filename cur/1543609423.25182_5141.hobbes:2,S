We have now tested the latest Red Hat 7.2 kernel (2.4.7.-10) and it 
passes our regression tests, which means that it is indeed a reasonably 
stable kernel that I would be willing to put my home directory on if it 
was me and I wasn't using NFS on it.  (I used 2.4.5 on my laptop for 
months with no problem, and I would guess that it is as stable as that 
one, when we talk about stable, remember we mean stable for a a few 
hundred thousand users).  The latest Linus kernels will be more stable, 
and since Linux is still stabilizing, I would guess that using a recent 
kernel is going to remain a good idea for the next few months.  
 Apologies to Red Hat for relying on second hand reports, and for that 
reason advising users to go to a kernel I had more knowledge about. 
 Users using NFS should keep a watch on the recently found bug involving 
rename, I think a patch just came out recently, and I expect it will be 
going into the kernel soon.
