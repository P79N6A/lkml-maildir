I didn't claim that it didn't change the code -- you know
that I'm not a white space warrior, so I normally don't bother
with these kinds of patches -- just that it uses the usual Linux 
idioms for global TLB flushing.

The instruction stream changes (more cr* accesses), but the actual flushes 
do not.  There is the exact same number of global TLB flushes (three
as requested by the Intel manual); just instead of in weird open coded 
style they are done in standard Linux style. 
I think it's an improvement because the old code fooled me at least,
so it's not 100% obvious.

I don't think that's true actually; at least it doesn't match my experience
from maintaing that code for quite some time. MTRR was never particularly
fragile, just ugly.
Anyways I personally won't be fooled by that code again, so if 
you're not interested in (IMHO) cleaner and more readable and 
more maintaintable code then it's fine for me to not apply the patch.
