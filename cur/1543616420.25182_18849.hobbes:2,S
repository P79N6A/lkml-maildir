Yes, that's one (among many other possible) solution.

That's what we do on ia64 also.  There is a performance penalty though
for programs that *do* generate code dynamically (in the form of
additional page faults).  I don't think it's a huge issue, but like I
said earlier: if there is a simple solution that gets rid of the
problem entirely, I'd prefer that.

On ia64, we simply map the trampoline in the kernel's gate page.  This
is a special page that can be executed by user level, but not read or
written (in the future, we may use this page for system calls, too).
No dynamic code generation needed for this (indeed, we even share the
TLB entry across all processes ;-).
Wouldn't it be better to use the sa_restorer approach on PPC like x86
and Alpha (and probably others) do?  That would avoid dynamic code
generation.

Yes, my thinking exactly.

Right.  I hope it's fair to say that the principle could/should be:
	- applications must use mprotect() to ensure malloc'd memory
	  is executable
	- Linux platforms *may* choose to enforce this by making
	  sbrk() memory not EXECUTABLE by default
This way, we can turn of execute permission on ia64 and the other
platforms have the choice whether to follow suite or to leave things
as they are.
Thanks,
