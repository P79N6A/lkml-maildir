Please test it and post the numbers. csum_partial_copy_generic() already
does prefetching - the real test would be to check lat_tcp and bw_tcp
numbers over gigabit, with and without this patch applied. (the same
numbers over localhost dont really count.) Eg. we had smart KNI-based
memcpy routines as well, and it turned out that bw_tcp over gigabit
actually got slower. [testing over 100mbit isnt enough obviously because
x86 CPUs csum much faster than that.]
