They don't have to. They just compile a kernel with the checks disabled,
and use the interface as before.

Upgrading firmware would typically be an unusual enough event the reboot
wouldn't be an issue. In the environments where a reboot is unacceptable,
a firmware change on-the-fly would probably be unacceptable too...
I'd rather like to see a nice "Manufacturer's Diagnostics/Update Disk"
available for my hardware. Easier and cheaper for them than supporting
Windows 98/ME, Windows NT/2k, Linux, Solaris/x86, BeOS, MacOS,
Solaris/SPARC, and every other OS which might be used with the drive!
(In fact, with Linux, they should be able to write one CPU-neutral
utility to do the work, then just recompile for each hardware platform
supported, along with a suitable kernel. Much better than the
alternatives...)
