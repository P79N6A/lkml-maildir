No, actually you can a) reply to my -plain text- email and yes...this is 
plain text that has been trimmed, b) wait because I'm involved in this 
discussion, I go to my queue and pre-auth people involved.
So it's fine for you to have filters of your choosing, but someone 
else's filter's of their choosing are obnoxious...very social.
