Exactly. So can we simply merge root-only fuse, and then worry
how to make it safe with user-mounted fuse. See your own unfsd example
why user-mounting is bad.
One possible solution would be to have root-owned fused that
talks to user-owned fused-s and checks they are behaving correctly?
Second is somehow improving those two lines this long thread is all about...
