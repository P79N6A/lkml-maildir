That logic has always been a bit strange -- picking out the
address _before_ it starts the reset/set_address/get_descriptor
code.  Here's where that strangeness actually helps ... :)

It would be dropped after the address is assigned (the bus
no longer has an "address zero") ... rather than waiting
until after the device was configured and all its interfaces
were probed.  I think that's the issue Oliver alluded to in
his followup to your comment.
