It might well have been - did these people then trawl through the BIND
sources to try to find the bug itself, and frequently develop an
exploit before the official patches were released?  If so, why didn't
they just assume that there was a bug in BIND and go looking for it
instead of waiting for circumstantial evidence that there mighe be
before they started looking.  
You'll have to explain why leaking the information "that there is a
bug in $PROGRAM", by fixing it (without disclosing either the bug or
the fix), is a problem.  After all, you can assume that for every
black hat foolish enough to sit around waiting for some evidence that
a bug exists before trying to find it, there'll be another that just
went looking anyway and has already found it.  It's better for all
concerned that the vendors protect themselves against the latter bunch
as soon as they reasonably can.
