I'll go as far as agreeing they do not matching any _practical_ reality.

But that is the case I plan on coding....

O.k. I'll step back and let you guys handle the normal cases.  I rarely
get past "core startup" and "core shutdown".

I'm doing my best to provide a real world alternative to ACPI on some
boards. 
My perspective is coming from linuxBIOS, or in general GPL'd
firmware, so it is a little different.  
But at this point in the conversation it looks like I should just back
off, let the core API get the easy cases correct.  And then come back
and figure out how to handle the truly weird cases.
