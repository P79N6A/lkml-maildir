Does it freeze on boot?  If so, it may be gpm causing it.  Pavel
machek diagnosed this one, and the fix is to simply remove gpm from
your boot scripts.  This worked fine for me, so I never tried to fix
the _real problem_.
Of course, if you haven't got to userland yet, then its not the same
problem.
Starting gpm after boot works, for some bizarre reason.
