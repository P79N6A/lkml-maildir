Subject: [PATCH] tty_set_ldisc receive_room fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/4/451

Fix tty_set_ldisc in tty_io.c so that tty->receive_room is
only cleared if actually changing line disciplines.
Without this fix a problem occurs when requesting the line
discipline to change to the same line discipline. In this case
tty->receive_room is cleared but ldisc->open() is not called
to set tty->receive_room back to a sane value. The result
is that tty->receive_room is stuck at 0 preventing the tty
flip buffer from passing receive data to the line discipline.
For example: a switch from N_TTY to N_TTY followed by
a select() call for read input results in data never being
received because tty->receive_room is stuck at zero.
A switch from N_TTY to N_TTY followed by
a read() call works because the read() call itself
sets tty->receive_room correctly (but select does not).
Previously (< 2.6.18) this was not a problem because
the tty flip buffer pushed data to the line discipline
without regard for tty->receive room.
