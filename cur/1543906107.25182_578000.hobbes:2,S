I am at work actually, so i cant test anything. End of this week i got 
to vacation, so i possibly can return testing in 1 month again.

Problem is, that i can't reproduce it after last reboot.
Can this be different on each reboot ? Any idea ?
About another kernel: i only had -ck kernels since last year or more, i 
can remember i had same behavier atleast 6 month ago, or maybe more. But 
it wasn't that hard and it dissapiered self after some time.
Now on first run of 2.6.22.1-cfs-v19.1 i got it again. And realy bad. It 
was even very hard to write report mail. I did reboot, day after that it 
was back, but not that hard. And now rebooted yesterday and cant 
reproduce it at all.
