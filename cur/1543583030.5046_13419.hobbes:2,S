hi.
for partitions not in the first 8gb of a harddisk, what
should the c/h/s start and end value be ?
most fdisks seem to set start and end to 255/63/1023.
but partition magic creates partitions with start set to
0/1/1023 and end set to 255/63/1023, and detects a problem
if start is set to 255/63/1023.
so, how should a partition table look like ?
regards, andreas
