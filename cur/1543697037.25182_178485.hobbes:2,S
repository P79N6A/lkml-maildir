Yup, I was using a patched mm3 so I wanted to try the plain one, but due 
to your post, I can conclude it really is mm3 which is really bad. I 
noticed this as well. Using Nick's CPU scheduler things are not thaaat 
bad, but still far from mm2. I think there is some major problem 
introduced to mm3. Without Nicks patch doing an emerge/compiling, even 
my mouse heavily stutters like hell, regradless of the used io 
scheduler. With Nick's patch the mouse is rather OK, but the rest if the 
system is still not really usable. It is not a HD problem...
Going back to mm2 (patched mm2) and everything it fine again.
