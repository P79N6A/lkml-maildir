	Hi folks,
I'm playing with an usb-ethernet device and it seems to me
it receive correct frames, but when i pass them to the
upper layer they just disappear.  I passed complete junk to
the IP layer expecting it to scream, but surprisingly (to me)
nothing happened.
How am i supposed to get a feedback from the upper layers?
