It's technical merit will decide, or methinks maybe Linux isn't as good as
I once thought.

They aren't files in terms of your definition, being "blocks of data
residing
on physical media, being presented in contiguous fashion via a named node
called a file", but in the purest sense, they are as much a *special* file
as anything.

No it didn't. It lets drivers decide, and you can chown/chmod/ln etc to your
heart's content, but persistence was handled by tar which worked beautifully
via a standard FILESYSTEM INTERFACE.

The saga of device fs involves people who for no better reason than
emotional
stupidity reject a better idea, not technical fault. It seems you are
implying
the current devfs would be bad to have in the kernel. Cite your reasons.

I was talking about extensions for devfsd, where, I SHOULD have said "when
devfsd gets awoken by a devfs namespace change, devfsd could..."

I tell it like it is.
