Yes. true. schedstats and delay accounting share code and taskstats is
a transport mechansim. I'll try and look at /proc/PID/stat and /proc/PID/sched
and /proc/sched_debug.

I'll start looking into splitting sum_exec_time into utime and stime
based on the ratio already present in the task structure.
