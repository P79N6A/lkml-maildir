the arp rfc can be found at
ftp://venera.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc826.txt
 but it won't get
you a definite solution to your question-- it's severely
outdated...
"Alternatively, network mail can be sent to DCP@MIT-MC." 
...that's how old the arp rfc is!                                           
I won't say 'right', since it's only there to make
poorly-configured machines work right...but it won't break
anything and it's often done...
is this breaking something on your network, or are you just
wondering about it?
the words network and subnet aren't interchangable-- arp
should be able to flow freely from one part of an ethernet
network to another (if thje requests/responses truly belong
there -- switching is very useful:)
the sticky point is whether machines should be allowed to
respond to arp requests for machines which aren't on the
same physical network.
i.e. whether machines should be able to lie and say "hey,
i'm part of the local network", when they aren't
in a perfect network, only the machines arped for will
respond...
as a natural consequence of that, machines not on the
physical network can't respond
