OK, if tty layer save the new terminal settings to an old one properly,
How could this happen?

If I recall correctly, the call path is as follows:
sys_ioctl->vfs_ioctl->do_ioctl->tty_ioctl->n_tty_ioctl->set_termios,
In set_termios, tmp_termios will be pointed to the argument "arg",
which includes the   wrong c_cflag.
Yes, from the back trace stack, it appears to come from userspace. But
I didn't startup any application. If there should be one, I think it's
shell.
But why shell remembers the initial terminal settings correctly, other
than last inital terminal settings? It must be passed from kernel
space, from tty layer, right?
I can't believe it's caused by the userspace, I'll go further to find
the root cause.
