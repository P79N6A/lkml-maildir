Ouch, that means a typical user-space program/library that wants to use
this technique has to have an intimate relationship with its malloc()
implementation: it's not in general safe to call brk() unless you are
the memory allocator.  (Yes, I know you can call brk() with Glibc's
malloc(), but... dependencies upon dependencies!)  And even when it is
safe to allocate with brk(), there's no safe way to free that memory.
So this would be fine for the stdio built in to Glibc, perhaps.

Granted, you might re-use the area if you're doing block reads like
stdio, compiler, XML parser etc.  But not a few programs want to:
   1. Allocate enough memory to hold whole file.
   2. Load file into memory.

Isn't that SIGBUS :-)
(Not that the architectures are at all consistent on this..)

I agree, although I think this particular optimisation requires some
quite unusual preparation by user space - I still think GCC would need
to call open/fstat/mmap/read/munmap/close.
You've rightly pointed out that memcpy() is faster for a page, rather
than VM tweaking.  But this isn't true of large reads, is it?
Then the TLB invalidation cost could, in principle, be amortised over
the whole large read.
