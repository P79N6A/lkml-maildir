Agreed the congestion modules are a corner case. I even mentioned that in the
patch. I would be happy to drop that one if that is the consensus.
It was more done as a example anyways. That is why I made it an separate
namespace from "tcp"
But for many other TCP symbols it makes a lot of sense: all the functions
only used by tcp_ipv6.c. If someone wants to write support for a "IPv7" or
similar they really should do it in tree. So I think the "tcp" and  "inet"
namespaces make a lot of sense.

If there are new users they will need to get proper review and should
be in tree.  MODULE_ALLOW() enforces that.

What complexity? You're always claiming it is complex. It isn't really.

Again for rusty @)
Goals are:
- Limit the interfaces available for out of tree modules to reasonably 
stable ones that are already used by a larger set of drivers.
This can also have further downstream advantages.
For example it might be a reasonable future rule to require all unconditionally
EXPORT_SYMBOL()s to have a complete LinuxDoc documentation entry.
- Explicitely declare in source what is clearly internal and not intended to
be a generally usable interface.
e.g. for the LinuxDoc example above such internal functions don't necessarily
need full LinuxDoc documentation.
- Force review from core maintainers for use of such internal interfaces
- Limit size of exported API to make stable ABIs for enterprise
distributions easier
[Yes I know that is not a popular topic on l-k, but it's a day-to-day
problem for these distros and out of tree solutions do not work]
