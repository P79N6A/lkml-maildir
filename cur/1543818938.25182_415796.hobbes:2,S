Hmm, I was worried about the read to the 64 bit global counter, there is
no lock to protect it from getting an half updated 64 bit counter. But I
think the window is probably small, and with what Andreas suggested
(keep the local per cpu counter as 32 bit value), we would avoid this
non-atomic math in most cases.
Well,anyway this counter is just an approximate value, and currently
(with 32 bit global counter) we could still read an old global counter
value while it's being updated since no lock is required while read it.

I think that will work, and we could get rid of the cheating
percpu_counter_read_positive() totally;)
So I think we could combine these two together: make the global counter
an unsigned 64 bit (u64) and keep the per cpu counter still signed 32
bit type, and also, defer updates the global counter to the global if
the end result is larger that before. This way we could have remove the
need for percpu_counter_read_positive(), and also allow the counter
being used for 64 bit accounting on 32 bit arch.
