Interesting idea, though you'd need to auto login one of the consoles (since
the shell won't be up at the login prompt).

We're currently using the XTest extension, which works well. There are a number
of techniques you can use for X.
I just wrote a proof-of-concept for a truly hideous console solution:
    o Read the first line of /dev/vcs0
    o Write the to-be-pasted text to /dev/vcs0
    o Select the text via ioctl on /dev/tty0
    o Restore the first line of /dev/vcs0
    o Paste via ioctl on /dev/tty0
Hehehe. It works. And it's good just for the gross-out value.
Thanks,
b.c.
