I'm a someone with such a controller (that's my boog here)
But I only have these drives.
So I can only confirm the combo it deadly.
(I could possibly try to plug one on the nforce4 controller, not sure if
extracting the box from the tangle of cables and hardware he's part of
is worth it. sata_nv is rev-eng, while the siI docs are public, right?)
I do suspect Eric D. Mudama knows if the problem is on the hard-drive
