Why?  Why not put it in ROM with your kernel image, look at how the
kernel build process does it with the "built-in" initramfs.
If that doesn't work, initrd still works just as well for udev, that's
what RH does.

I boot my boxes with nothing in /dev and have been for almost a year
now.  udev works just fine for this, and so do some other programs that
work like udev does.
I hope everyone can just forget about my nano devfs proposal, and just
pass it off as a example of someone who went temporarily insane.
