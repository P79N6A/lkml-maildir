Subject: 2.6.0-test1 hangs silently in under an hour

I've got a desktop machine which is hanging regularly with 
recent 2.5 and now 2.6.0-test1 releases. It seems very solid 
running 2.4.20 ...
The machine functions as a normal desktop (email, X, web browser,
etc) and as an NFS server for music served to a machine attached to 
the stereo (so light but consistent disk and network activity).
The symptom is simply a totally hung system - no response to keyboard, 
mouse, network pings, ctrl-alt-del, or magic sysrq. There is no output
to /var/log/messages that survives a reboot. I've compiled the kernel
with all the kernel debugging options set to true with no difference in
behavior:
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT=y
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=y
CONFIG_X86_EXTRA_IRQS=y
CONFIG_X86_FIND_SMP_CONFIG=y
CONFIG_X86_MPPARSE=y
Some general info - 
Distribution: Red Hat 8.0
Hardware Environment: Athlon XP1900
Software Environment: gcc 3.2
The motherboard is an Asus A7V266-E. 
I'd be happy to run test patches, change config options, etc if that
would help ... also, if there's anything else I should be doing to 
track this down before reporting, please let me know or point me 
to a document.
I'm not a subscriber to lkml, so please CC me on any replies.
