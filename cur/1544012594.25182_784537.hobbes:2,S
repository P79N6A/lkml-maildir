Of course, by construction, there is nothing relying on the current
relatime semantics. The problem is that whenever you are making relatime
closer to the atime behaviour, you are also getting closer to the
original drawbacks of atime (one read generates one write).

Yes, it might bring important drawbacks: performance-wise, relatime will
become more like atime, making it much less useful. There is also a
significant number of desktop computers that are turned on once a day,
the boot time may get hindered by those additional writes.
Actually, you are changing relatime from a boolean condition (maximum
one additional write per write) to a atime with a coarse grain (maximum
one additional write per day). Today you found a use case that needs a
precision of one day. Tomorrow, someone else will find a use case that
needs a precision of one hour. So maybe what is actually needed is a
third option, a "grainatime" option where you can change the precision
of the atime.
