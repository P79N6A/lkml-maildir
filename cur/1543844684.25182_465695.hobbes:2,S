I was suggesting something like:
	high = dev ? dev->coherent_dma_mask : 16*1024*1024;
instead.  May as well combine your NULL check and your assignment.  It'll 
also do the right thing for 64 bit devices so we don't put unnecessary 
pressure on the 32 bit range.  Or am I spacing out and reading the code 
wrong?

Even better.
