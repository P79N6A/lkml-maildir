Can you make rq_has_rt_task the slow path? Adding things like this
can actually be noticable on microbenchmarks (eg. pipe based ctx
switching). Its probably cache artifacts that I see, but it wouldn't
hurt to keep the scheduler as tight as possible.
I think this should cover it.
int rq_has_rt_task(int cpu)
{
	runqueue_t *rq = cpu_rq(cpu);
	return (sched_find_first_bit(rq->active) < MAX_RT_PRIO);
}
Any good?
