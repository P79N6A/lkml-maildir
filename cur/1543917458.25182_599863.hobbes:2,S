Subject: [PATCH] Break ELF_PLATFORM and stack pointer randomization dependency
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/28/114

Currently arch_align_stack() is used by fs/binfmt_elf.c to randomize
stack pointer inside a page. But this happens only if ELF_PLATFORM
symbol is defined.
ELF_PLATFORM is normally set if the architecture wants ld.so to load
implementation specific libraries for optimization. And currently a
lot of architectures just yield this symbol to NULL.
This is the case for MIPS architecture where ELF_PLATFORM is NULL but
arch_align_stack() has been redefined to do stack inside page
randomization. So in this case no randomization is actually done.
This patch breaks this dependency which seems to be useless and allows
platforms such MIPS to do the randomization.

	Andrew,
   I tried several times to poke people on the list to understand why
   this dependency exists at all, but unfortunately got no answers.
   So I'm submitting this patch to at least have some feedbacks. An
   easier solution would be to define ELF_PLATFORM to a dummy string
   for MIPS but it sounds very hackish.
   Thanks,
		Franck
