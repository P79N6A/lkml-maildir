It is not bad. It just means precisely what the messages say: your
/boot/System.map is a version for kernel version 2.2.5, and you are running
another kernel.
Simple solution: you will find that /boot/System.map is a symlink to
/boot/System.map-2.2.5-15
Just delete the symlink, you can leave the /boot/System.map-2.2.5-15 file.
System.map is a list of all kernel functions and their addresses, which is
only needed for debugging purposes.
I believe you can build one yourself with the nm command, but I don't know
the precise syntax.
Hope this helps,
Ward.
