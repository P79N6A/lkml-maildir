What you say is true; but Win32 -- which pretty much all Windows apps use --
disallows the following:
\/:*?"<>|
... from that, they chose ":" as the stream delimiter, since the only other
place it is used is with the drive letters. For the user, and most
(non-native, i.e., Win32) apps, there are limitations on what a filename can
contain.
