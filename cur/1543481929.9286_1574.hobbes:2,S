It's not obvious in the patch because there isn't enough context
visible, but this bit of code should still be inside
  if [ "$ARCH" = "sparc" -o "$ARCH" = "sparc64" ]; then
    ...
  fi
Here's the corresponding section in my patched drivers/video/Config.in:
  if [ "$ARCH" = "sparc" -o "$ARCH" = "sparc64" ]; then
    bool 'SBUS and UPA framebuffers' CONFIG_FB_SBUS
    if [ "$CONFIG_FB_SBUS" != "n" ]; then
      if [ "$ARCH" = "sparc64" ]; then
	bool '  Creator/Creator3D support' CONFIG_FB_CREATOR
      fi
      bool '  CGsix (GX,TurboGX) support' CONFIG_FB_CGSIX
      bool '  BWtwo support' CONFIG_FB_BWTWO
      bool '  CGthree support' CONFIG_FB_CGTHREE
      if [ "$ARCH" = "sparc" ]; then
        bool '  TCX (SS4/SS5 only) support' CONFIG_FB_TCX
	bool '  CGfourteen (SX) support' CONFIG_FB_CGFOURTEEN
      fi
      bool '  Leo (ZX) support' CONFIG_FB_LEO
    fi
    if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" != "n" ]; then
      bool 'PCI framebuffers' CONFIG_FB_PCI
      if [ "$CONFIG_FB_PCI" != "n" ]; then
	if [ "$ARCH" = "sparc" ]; then
	  bool '  IGA 168x display support' CONFIG_FB_IGA
        fi
      fi
    fi
  fi
