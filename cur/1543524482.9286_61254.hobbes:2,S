No, it's AND'ed with 0xFFFFE000
"current"'s task-struct is stored at the beginning of the kernel-land
stack space.  get_current just clears out the low-order bits from the
current stack pointer to get the first address.  Neat little
efficiency trick, since it keeps the address of the commonly-used
"current" struct without dereferencing a pointer in memory, plus
it automatically follows the currently running kernel thread.

"current" is the task_struct of the thread that queries it - it
has nothing to do with what is running on the other CPUs.
