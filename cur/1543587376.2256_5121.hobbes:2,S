Bad idea. If you do loops over directory contents you will almost
permanently have almost all dentries freeable. Doesn't make freeing
them a good thing - think of the effects it would have.
Simple question: how many of dentries in /usr/src/linux/include/linux
are busy at any given moment during the compile? At most 10, I suspect.
I.e. ~4%.
I would rather go for active keeping the amount of dirty inodes low,
so that freeing would be cheap. Doing massive write_inode when we
get low on memory is, indeed, a bad thing, but you don't have to
tie that to freeing stuff. Heck, IIRC you are using quite a similar
logics for pagecache...
