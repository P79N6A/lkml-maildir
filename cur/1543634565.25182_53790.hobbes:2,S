OOoooh, ouch. You apparently missed the two (or more) significant flamewars
on these topics. The current status is that kbuild will probably slowly be
merged by going through Kai and being munged into Linus-acceptable patches,
while CML2 will probably sit around and never get merged unless ESR accepts
the fact that cool code solving a problem doesn't automagically get into
the kernel.
See the thread rooted somewhere around here ("Disgusted with Kbuild..."):
