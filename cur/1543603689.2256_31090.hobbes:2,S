I was refering to the mundane load of mongo.pl with 5 processes. Something
the systems should withstand. If you have more then 10GB of database to
access you would want it to work. I am not talking about a lot of
processes but a lot of disk IO.
I have just one box running SMP with highmem and that one is acting
funny. All the other SMP ur Uni servers have absolutely no
problems.
Disable highmem and the problem goes away while halving your ram. That is
not very efficient is it?
Cheers
