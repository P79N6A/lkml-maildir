this is true so long as there is only one thread submitting I/O and
doing fsync().  for something like a mail server, it can run
multi-threaded, and still get data integrity, if the changes are
spread out across more than one file.

not all workloads are completely serial, transactions themselves may
have no inter-dependencies at all.  so it depends on the benchmark,
and what workload you're measuring.  in cases like this, threading can
have a big advantage.
