What you don't want to do is break printk. In AberMUD I used macros for
something similar
#define Module  static char *Mod_Name=
#define Version static char *Ver_Name=
#define Author  static char *Aut_Name=
#define Error(x)        ErrFunc((x),Mod_Name,Ver_Name,__LINE__,__FILE__)
And drivers started
Module  "System";
Version "1.28";
Author  "----*(A)";
However that doesn't work for varargs. Nevertheless something of a similar
approach might let you avoid breaking printk in most old code. If you can
avoid a grand replacement of printk you win lots of friends. If you can
do it in a way that people can do automated parsing of kernel messages
for translation tables in klogd/initlog/dmesg you also win lots of friends.
