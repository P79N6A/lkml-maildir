Ok, looking at the -bk1-bk2 incremental patch, there's a couple of
possibilities:
- changes to the x86 PCI code
- changes to yenta_socket.c to add different overrides
- add burst support to yenta_socket.c for TI bridges
- add ISA interrupt routing work-around for TI bridges
I think the number one suspect is probably the final one.  Could you try
reversing this patch please?
