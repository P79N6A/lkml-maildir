Fonts are a bit bad in my browser :)
Kirk, I understand your frustration - yes, Linux is not the perfect
place to include startups ideas, and yes it lacks some features modern
(or old) systems support for years, but things change with time.
I posted a patch which allows to poll for signals, it can be trivially
adopted to support timers and essentially any other events.
Kevent did that too, but some things are just too radical for immediate
support, especially when majority of users do not require additional
functionality.
People do work, and a lot of them do really good work, so no need for
rude talks about how things are bad. Things change - even I support
that, although kevent ignorance should put me into the first line with
you :)
Be good, and be cool.
