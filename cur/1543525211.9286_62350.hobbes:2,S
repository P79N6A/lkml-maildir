The rtc.c file was patched and rtc_latency works fine.
I just now confirmed that the crash also occurs with 2.2.13 and the
lowlatency-2.2.13-A1 patch during the disk I/O test using rtc_latency.
This seems to indicate that the bugfixes added to form 
lowlatency-2.2.14-B1 are not the culprit.
I suspect that the lowlatency patches aggravate a MM bug in 2.2.13 and
2.2.14.  I think I might try Andrea's 2.2.14aa6 kernel which I believe
has some MM bugfixes in it.  
Does anyone have suggestions for a more methodical approach?
