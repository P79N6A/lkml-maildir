Well it is reasonable that mount should exclude other attempts
to mount. However the device holding the root file system
may be an ATA or SCSI disk and the ide-disk and sd drivers
do not support SMART probing directly.
Tools like smartmontools periodically (or on demand) probe disks
to find their SMART status. According to an IBM white paper
a significant percentage of disk failures can be predicted
by increased error rates and drive temperature. It doesn't
seem practical to unmount the root file system (and any other
mounted partitions) to allow such a probe then remount.
If this policy is to remain in lk 2.6 (for SCSI disks
but not ATA disks yet) then perhaps the sd and sr drivers
need to be changed to treat READ and WRITE commands differently
from other commands. Other commands should not be subject
block level policy.
