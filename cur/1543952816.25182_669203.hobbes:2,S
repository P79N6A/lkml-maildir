In order to make this work, you would have to prevent new children from
being registered starting from the time just after prepare() returns,
rather than from the time just before suspend() is called.  Nothing is
wrong with that, but it requires a redesign of the new flags.  (It's 
worth mentioning that drivers will want to have a flag that gets set 
just _before_ prepare() -- just _after_ is too late.)
In the other direction, it ought to be okay to allow new children to 
be registered during resume().  There's no need to wait for complete().

I agree.  For example, there isn't much point in having prepare() and
complete() entries for noirq.
