Only, /meta is a filesystem that already makes stuff go away for us, so 
all we have left is the issue of whether using /meta costs us 
performance, or whether breaking POSIX to add a symlink (such as 
foo/...) really gives us that much more usability.
I don't know the first thing about whether it costs us performance, 
although it seems like it could be negligable considering the existance 
of mount --bind.
I don't think file-as-dir gives us that much more usability, because we 
can always create a simple program or shell script that 'cd's us into 
metadata.  It's still easier than having a simple program that 
manipulates the metadata directly, because this way we can do 'cd' and 
'ls' and so on inside the metadata directory.
And, once we start talking about applications, /meta will be more 
readily supported (as in, some apps will go through a pathname and stop 
when they get to a file, and then there's tar).  On apps which don't 
have direct support for /meta, you'd be navigating to the file in 
question and then manually typing '...' into the dialog, so I don't see 
why typing '...' at the end is better than typing '/meta' or '/meta/vfs' 
at the beginning.
That said, I'm still not entirely sure how we get /meta/vfs to work 
other than adding a '...' sort of delimiter anyway.

Doesn't it make directory operations slower, too?
And, will it require a format change?
