ok, makes me wonder -- I have two pieces of software (pretty old)
mpack and munpack; anyoine who knows a place where the sources are ? these
are the only two programs that are zmagic here. I could drop a.out conpletely
if I could recompile them. it also gets rid of the known : 
"fd_offset is not page aligned. Please convert program:" messages (however,
it looks like it still works)
