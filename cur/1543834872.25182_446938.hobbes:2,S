There are two different types of alignment:
- SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN: it's a recommendation, it's regularly ignored.
- the align parameter, or ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN: It's mandatory. For 
example the pgd structures must be 4 kB aligned, it's required by the 
hardware. And I think there was (is?) a structure where ptr & ~(size-1) 
was used to find the start of the structure.
Thus the patch is correct, it's a bug in the slab allocator. If 
HWCACHE_ALIGN is set, then the allocator ignores align or 
ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN.
