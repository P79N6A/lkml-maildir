Many older network drivers ditto
Much of the ISDN layer ditto

Add "Most older SCSI controllers are *NOT* doing error handling. Be
careful."
Add "Simplex IDE devices (eg Ali15x3) are missing DMA sometimes"
Add "Serverworks OSB4 may panic on bad blocks or other non fatal errors"
Add "PCMCIA IDE hangs on eject"
Add "Most PCMCIA devices have unload races and may oops on eject"
Add "Modular IDE does not yet work, modular IDE PCI modules sometimes
oops on loading"

LVM1 is no longer supported, upgrade to LVM2. This supports the LVM1
disk format.

Right at the moment the executive summary would be "ISAPnP doesnt work
any more but the new interfaces will mean it works a lot better soon (I
hope)"

Kind of work in some cases, they are deprecated and may vanish before
2.6 or may vanish the release after.

Actually its happening in 2.5 back merging to 2.4-ac now.

Early PII Xeon processors and possibly other early PII processors
require microcode updates either from the BIOS or the microcode driver
to handle O(1) scheduler reliably
Can you also mention not using gcc 3.0.x (stack pointer handling bug)
