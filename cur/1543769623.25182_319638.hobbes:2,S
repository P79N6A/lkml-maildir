That's not quite what I meant.  Instead of screwing with atomic_read()
in there, why don't we simply do the following:
	a) atomic_dec_and_lock() in put_namespace()
	b) __put_namespace() called without dropping lock
	c) the first thing done by __put_namespace would be
struct vfsmount *root = namespace->root;
namespace->root = NULL;
spin_unlock(...);
....
umount_tree(root);
...
	d) check in mark_... would be simply namespace && namespace->root.
And we are all set; no screwing around with atomic_read(), no magic at all.
Dying namespace gets NULL ->root.
All changes of ->root happen under spinlock.
If under a spinlock we see non-NULL ->mnt_namespace, it won't be freed until
we drop the lock (we will set ->mnt_namespace to NULL under that lock before
we get to freeing namespace).
If under a spinlock we see non-NULL ->mnt_namespace and ->mnt_namespace->root,
we can grab a reference to namespace and be sure that it won't go away.
