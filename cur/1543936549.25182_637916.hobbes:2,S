Why is a shared IRQ a problem for you?  IRQ handlers are supposed to
be fast enough that disabling an IRQ line for the duration of the
handler execution should not be a problem even if the IRQ is shared.
VGA interrupts in particular should only fire once per frame and only
need to flip some bits to wake up any processes waiting on vsync.
If you have issues with a shared VGA interrupt then the bug is that
some IRQ handler runs for too long and should be deferring work to a
bottom half.
