It's just a question of how you define "to kill" :-) But the
naming is ambiguous, because people may indeed expect
tasklet_kill to work like kill(2).
Obviously, tasklet_kill could set a flag that prevents a
tasklet from rescheduling itself. But then you'd change
the semantics of tasklet_schedule, and in many cases, you'd
still need some flag to tell you what has happened.
Example: if a tasklet allocates some resources, and frees
them when running the next time, you'd need a flag that
tells the caller(s) of tasklet_kill whether there are
still such resources that need freeing.
The current mechanism makes sure that the tasklet will
execute one last time, if scheduled before tasklet_kill.
