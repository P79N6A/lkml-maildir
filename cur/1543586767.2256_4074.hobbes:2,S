Denial of Service attack. 11000 processes and the kernel locks up hard,
regardless of the amount of memory.(sane ulimits prevent that)

CLONE_PID is a special flag for the boot process, normal processes can't
set that flag. (first line of do_fork() returns -EPERM)
Even without CLONE_PID two threads can get the same pid:
get_pid searches for a new pid by scanning though the task list.
But the caller of get_pid doesn't atomically add the new value to the
task list.
If copy_fs, copy_files, copy_mm sleep, then a second thread could get
the same pid.
It's only possible if nearly all pid values are used up, so it's not a
problem that must be fixed immediately.
