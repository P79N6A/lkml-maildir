I had some trouble with an Intel STL 2 board and the onboard EEPRO100.
Samba worked OK but it always got stuck on NFS transfers.
There was a bug in the older BMC firmware, so the eepro100 detected
some NFS frames as "TCO" packets.

If you use the e100 driver, you can look at 
/proc/net/PRO_LAN_ADAPTERS/eth0.info
If the "Tx_TCO_Packets" entry isn't zero after NFS times out,
this may be your problem.
With the eepro100 driver you will only see overruns with ifconfig.
If this is the case, you may want to check for a BMC (board management 
controller) software update.
