I was inplementing precisely the same diff while cleaning up the
select/poll timeout logic, when I came across this lkml post by George
Anziger,
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107772721007761&w=4
the relevant part of which is:
   As to small drifts of ~170 PPM, they are caused by code (ps I would 
   guess)
   that assumes that jiffies is exactly 1/HZ whereas it is NOT in the 2.6.*
   kernel.  The size of the jiffie that the kernel uses is returned by:
   struct timespec tv;
   :
   :
   clock_res(CLOCK_REALTIME, &tv);
I inferred from the above that a generic msec_to_jiffies()/jiffies_to_msec()
ought to use TICK_NSEC, as with the other routines in time.h.  For 32-bit
platforms the scaled arithmetic is simple; one has to be more careful
when BITS_PER_LONG == 64.
After e-mailing George about it, he replied:
   You might want to look at the code in time.h that does the jiffies to
   timespec conversion.  We did a lot of work to get that right for both 32 and
   64 bit platforms.  I don't think you really need more precision than we get
   on the 32 bit platforms (if I recall correctly it is in the 100 PPB range,
   yeah that is parts per BILLION).
   Unless this conversion is done a lot, I would just start with the timespec
   conversions and convert from / to using simple math.  As it is all power of
   10 stuff it should not have a precision problem.
He also supplied me with his test harness.
I haven't gotten around to doing this properly yet.  It seems that the
only place where precision is actually important (due to the possibility
of very long timeouts) is in poll/epoll, so perhaps it is best
to just code up a special version for them, as the simple version
becomes a no-op everywhere else for the default HZ==1000.
