No, as that means introducing a buggy version of kbuild-2.5 to fix the 
bugs afterwards. Sure, there are bugs, but they can be fixed either. I 
don't need to reintroduce all the kbuild-2.4 bugs therefor.
The one thing you all seem to have got wrong is that kbuild-2.5 does not 
overwrite kbuild-2.4 but exist in parallel to it. So there's nothing to 
fix, we could just introduce all the features one by one, but that means 
they all will only function after the last patch, which will be some kind 
of "activation".
For me, I don't purposely introduce bugs.
Regards,
Thunder
