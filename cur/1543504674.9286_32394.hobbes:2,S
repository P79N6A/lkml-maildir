That would depend on the exact device you are refering to.

You mean like RedHat 6.0 does right out of the box when you
enable the sound service in your main runlevel (which is on by
default, and works so long as the software was installed)?

If it is just saving your mixer settings that you are worried
about, this has nothing to do whatsoever with the kernel.  Any
setting that can be read from ANY device on the system, which can
also be equally written to, can be saved to disk by some program
or another, and stored back upon bootup.  The redhat default
install does this for the mixer allready, unless one has not
installed the required sound packages, or has disabled the
boot time sound service.
