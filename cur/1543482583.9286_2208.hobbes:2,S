Certainly the kernel code checks that the ELF file is either ET_EXEC or ET_DYN
(and not ET_CORE).  If ld-linux.so is doing a user-space exec, then I guess it
might forget to check the ELF file type and just go and map the segments as it
finds them... but all that means is that you get a strangely shaped address
space.  Which means that if people are having problems then it can be
reproduced in some other way.
