It's easy enough to download the e100 from Intel's site if you
want to use it.  I will continue to try to use the eepro100 unless
I find problems with my particular hardware NICS.  The eepro100
still supports MII-IOCTLS better than the e100 supports ethtool
interfaces, and I like to know all those twisty little bits!
