Ralf,
The psaux detection code in 2.2.x fails to find a valid device under some
circumstances.  I fought this battle last weekend on an older 486 box with
PS2 mouse on the motherboard.  Haven't had the time to debug the probe so
I took the sneaky way around and did:
*** pc_keyb.c.orig	Sat Mar  6 18:43:00 1999
--- pc_keyb.c	Sat Mar  6 00:14:53 1999
***************
*** 979,987 ****
  
  static int __init psaux_init(void)
  {
  	if (!detect_auxiliary_port())
  		return -EIO;
! 
  	misc_register(&psaux_mouse);
  	queue = (struct aux_queue *) kmalloc(sizeof(*queue), GFP_KERNEL);
  	memset(queue, 0, sizeof(*queue));
--- 979,988 ----
  
  static int __init psaux_init(void)
  {
+ #if 0
  	if (!detect_auxiliary_port())
  		return -EIO;
! #endif
  	misc_register(&psaux_mouse);
  	queue = (struct aux_queue *) kmalloc(sizeof(*queue), GFP_KERNEL);
  	memset(queue, 0, sizeof(*queue));
Please note that this is a rude hack.  The maintainer should be made aware
that it is missing devices on some platforms.
