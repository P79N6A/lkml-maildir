With a workaround patch for the boot time BUG, I was able to get ...
 - to single user mode w/o any errors
 - a [NOW] non fatal error getting the network up (telinit 3)
 - no further errors getting the X server up (telinit 5)
 - able to hear sample audio
 - system stayed up all night (daemons were stable...)
This is the first time in about two weeks that I had a reasonably stable
system (last known good is -T3).
I was about to run my normal stress tests when the system locked up.
The symptom was the display stopped updating / no mouse motion. Apparently
caused while I was dragging a window with the mouse (USB). We may still
have problems in that area. No apparent response to Alt-Sysrq keys;
hardware reset was sufficient to reboot.
Will check the system logs to see what I can find.
