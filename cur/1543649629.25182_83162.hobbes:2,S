We're again looping talking about threads and fd being bounced between
threads. It seems that we've very different opinions about the use of
threads and how server applications should be designed. IMHO if you're
thinking of bouncing fds among threads for their handling you're doing
something somehow wrong, but this is just my opinion ...
