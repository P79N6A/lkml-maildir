I think it's more of the matter that Mike is still changing the way the
SCSI core works with the class and driver model.  I suggest you take
this to the linux-scsi list to hash out the way scsi should and does
work in order to find the best solution for usb-storage, as I guess that
it also would be the best solution for all other SCSI host drivers.

Why not hold off until the scsi people are finished with their changes?
If after that, you _really_ need to be putting usb-storage only
attributes in the sysfs tree somewhere, we can talk again.
