Accepting your analysis, it still seems to me there's a difference,
though.  In an EROS-like world, you would only pay the complexity cost of doing
fscobject-like things in the postmortem analyzer that's trying to
stitch together the remaining pieces.  You wouldn't have to pay that same
cost in the kernel for each and every access to persistent stuff;  no
namespace management to worry about.
So, yes.  An EROS-like architecture has the same error-recovery
problem that fsck addresses. But it appears to me, at least as far as
I've taken the logic, that that problem would be better contained than
in a Unix-like system.

A much more serious objection, I agree.

Yes, I grant that's true.  (The way I'd put it is that you still need
something like commit/rollback in database-land.)  But this is a solvable
problem.  Butler Lampson showed years ago how to do provably correct
serialization of access to shared critical regions with timestamps
even in the absence of reliable locks.  So as long as your
hypothetical user can't futz with the system clock...

Not something I have opinions about -- or am qualified to. :-)

You're probably right; I'm told all EROS actually does at this point
is run its own debugging and benchmarking tools.  Still, the fact that
the test kernel can be that small is IMO an argument that the design
is sound.

No seeks to read inodes, because the map from EROS's virtual-space
blocks to disk blocks is almost trivial (essentially the disks get
treated like a honkin' big series of swap volumes).  So the disk
access pattern would be quite different, I think.

That, under most circumstances, you don't have to manage persistence
yourself (or to put it more concretely, no explicit disk I/O in most
applications).  That's clearly a huge win, even if you end up having to do 
more conventional-looking things in applications that require
commit/rollback.
And it's not clear to me that you do end up there; with one single
added atomic-flush primitive, I think you could use Lampson's
timestamp trickery to do reliable journalling without having to go all
the way to fs-like namespace management.

This is indeed true.  However, I may have some leverage on a win-win
solution.  But that's a topic for another day.
What I'm thinking is this: remember RT-Linux?  Suppose the kernel were
a process running over an EROS-like layer...
