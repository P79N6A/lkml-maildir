It has always been an error to call smp_call_function() with interrupts
disabled.  Recent 2.6 kernels check for this and issue a warning.  The
problem is not smp_call_function() or flush_tlb_all(), it is the code
that called them with interrupts disabled.  Find the calling code and
fix it to not disable interrupts.
