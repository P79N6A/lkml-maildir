An "absolute value of end time" variant of
select/poll/epoll/io_getevents would be good anyway from userspace, to
avoid the gettimeofday+poll race condition.
So, perhaps the solution here is to simply provide absolute time
variants of the system calls which currently take time delays, and
have the relative-time variants rewrite themselves into absolute form?
That's architecture neutral _and_ fixes a long-standing race
condition..
