No I'm not, but let's go further in that direction just for the sake of
argument.  You're then saying that you prefer realtime priorities to not
work in the HT setting, given that realtime tasks don't participate in
the 'single stream me' program.
 
I'm saying only that we're defeating the purpose of HT, and overriding a
user decision every time we force a sibling idle.

Sure.

So?  User asked for HT.  That's hardware multiplexing. It ain't free.
Buyer beware.

I don't think it does actually. Let your RT task sleep regularly, and
ever so briefly.  We don't evict lower priority tasks from siblings upon
wakeup, we only prevent entry... sometimes.

To me, the reason for interleaving is solely about keeping the core
busy .  It has nothing to do with SCHED_POLICY_X what so ever.

Re-read this paragraph with realtime task priorities in mind, or for
that matter, dynamic priorities.  If you carry your priority/throughput
argument to it's logical conclusion, only instruction streams of
absolutely equal priority should be able to share the core at any given
time.  You may as well just disable HT and be done with it.
To me, siblings are logically separate units, and should be treated as
such (as they mostly are).  They share an important resource, but so do
physically discrete units.
