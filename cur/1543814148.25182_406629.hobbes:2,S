I believe Xen disables sysenter.  The complications in my patch come 
from the fact that the vsyscall page has to be relocated dynamically, 
requiring, basically run time linking on the page and some tweaks to get 
sysenter to work.  If you don't use vsyscall (say, non-TLS glibc), then 
you don't need that complexity.  But I think it might be needed now, 
even for Xen.
