I'm sure that any message internals aren't; it leaves freedom to 
implement messages allocation in the way we like.

What's wrong with a) clocks per device b) no completion callback?
b) just makes it a sync call, it's a convenient thing for a developer.
As for places with kmalloc's and memcpy's, can you just point out one? 
I'm afraid it's all bare words here.
On the _contrary_, the approach we use allows to use lightweight 
non-standard allocation methods for messages which you just can't do.

Yes, but the transfer array is not of a fixed size, therefore it's not 
that easy to use custom allocation techniques.
I'm afraid though that you don't quite understand what I'm meaning here, 
but you'll see it in the core I'll post today.

What? What optional layers are you talking about???
And please look *attentively* into the code, memory allocation/copying 
happens only if a specific flag is set so it's no way it can be unnecessary.

Not necessarily; if we've got a preallocated memory pool, than it's not 
that important.
On the contrary, having messages of a same size makes it easier for 
write a custom malloc routine.
