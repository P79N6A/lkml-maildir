My point is that depending on any method of internal kernel ordering is 
fragile.
I would rather have the kernel export which drives are listed in CMOS / 
BIOS ROM, and let userspace say "my boot drive is the nth BIOS-listed 
drive."  For example, looking through the aic7xxx (or was it 
ncr53c8xxx?) drive, it gets boot drive ordering from BIOS/CMOS.  That 
piece of info can either be exported by driverfs from the low-level SCSI 
driver, or by a separate, tiny ncr53c8xxx_boot_drive driver.
Depending on pci_find_* ordering is very situation-dependent, and only 
covers N cases.  Then you have another N cases covered by the order in 
which you modprobe key drivers.  Then you have another N cases covered 
by special case code somewhere.  You'll never get all these cases right, 
in the kernel, the way the user wants.  That's why I say the 
responsibility for figuring out the boot drive should be pushed to 
initrd/initramfs.
