you could also setup more than one loopback
device with different offsets into the partitions ...
for my purposes, I use the folowing script (part)
YMMV,
Herbert
---------------------
losetup /dev/loop/0 $file
sfdisk --dump /dev/loop/0 | gawk '
	/^\/dev\/loop/ 	{ 
			  if ($6+0 > 0) {
				part=substr($1,13)+0;
				dev=sprintf("/dev/loop/%d", part);
				printf "losetup %s -o %d /dev/loop/0\n", dev, $4*512; 
				printf "fsck -p -f %s\n", dev; 
				printf "mkdir -p /mnt/disk/part%d\n", part; 
				printf "mount %s /mnt/disk/part%d\n", dev, part;
