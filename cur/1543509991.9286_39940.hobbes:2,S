There is nothing ambigous about this as long as Joe does not copy a
single line of GPL'ed code into his driver modules and his own
applications.

In this case you just make sure your wrapper code is not covered by
the GPL.

There is no problem here as far as I can tell. The important bit is to
make sure no GPL'ed code was copy-pasted into the proprietary code.

I don't see the problem, people are also shipping pre-installed PC's
with proprietary software added, nobody's complaining about those as
long as the license of the GPL'ed parts of the product is respected
(and other licenses).
