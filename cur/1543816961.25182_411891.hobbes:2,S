I wonder what is the value of it if it doesn't do guarantees or QoS?
In our experiments with it we failed to observe any fairness. So I 
suppose the only goal of this is too make sure that maliscuios user want 
consume all the CPU power, right?

we keep num_online_cpus runqueues per VPS.
Fairs scheduler is some kind of SFQ like algorithm which selects VPS to 
be scheduled, than standart linux scheduler selects a process in a VPS 
runqueues to run.

Sure! We feel the same, but people like numbers :)
Thanks,
