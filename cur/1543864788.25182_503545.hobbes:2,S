This board appears to have no APIC (MADT) table -- which is what Linux uses to enumerate processors
in ACPI mode.  (doesn't have MPS either, but in ACPI mode you wouldn't use it anyway).
Are there any BIOS SETUP settings for enabling SMP or ACPI features?
I guess that /proc/interrupts shows this system running in PIC mode?
Please open a bugzilla here and attach the output from acpidump.

Component: Config-Processors
Any chance you can see if Windows finds multiple processors on this board with this version of the BIOS?
This system may be proof that Linux needs to parse the DSDT to properly enumerate processors.
Though it is somewhat strange to have an SMP without an IOAPIC...
thanks,

ps. after you get the acpidump for the failing system, check for a BIOS update.
