Hi there,
looks like xfsdumpis broken with recent 2.6.11-rc Kernels. 2.6.11-rc4 is the
one I tried.
Strange enough ist does seem to work _sometimes_, but it does not work
most of the time.
If it does not work I just get the following message:
xfsdump: ERROR: /dev/sda2 does not identify a file system
I'm using Version 2.2.23 from debian sarge.
It seems to always work with the Distribution Kernel from Debian sarge.
Sven
