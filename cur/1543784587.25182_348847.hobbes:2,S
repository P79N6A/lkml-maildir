Btw, a perfect example of this is
	pci_set_power_state(pdev, 0);
which is a very common thing to do in a driver init routine. And it has
absolutely _no_ valid return values: it either succeeds, or it doesn't,
and the only reason it wouldn't succeed is because the device doesn't
support power management in the first place (in which case it already
effectively is in state 0).
In other words, there's nothing you can or should do about it. Testing the 
return value is pointless. And thus adding a "must_check" is really really 
wrong: it might make people do
	if (pci_set_power_state(pdev, 0))
		return -ENODEV
which is actually actively the _wrong_ thing to do, and would just cause 
old revisions of the chip that might not support PM capabilities to no 
longer work.
The problem with warnings is that people may take them too seriously, and 
generate bugs when trying to "fix" them.
