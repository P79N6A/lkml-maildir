   GPL is about distribution.
   e.g. NVidia can distribute .o file (with whatever license they have 
to) and nvidia.{c,h} files (even under GPL license).
   Then install.sh may do on behalf of user "gcc nvidia.c blob.o -o 
nvidia.ko". Resulting module are not going to be distributed - it is 
already at hand of end-user. So no violation of GPL whatsoever.
   Licensing is least technical issue regarding modules.
   But sure I would like to have open source drivers - at least then I 
have chance to clean them up ;-)))
   my 2 eurocents.

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
