You haven't quite completely fixed the SD calculations it seems:
--- Benchmarking simulated cpu of Gaming in the presence of simulated---
Load    Latency +/- SD (ms)  Max Latency   % Desired CPU
None       2.44 +/- nan         48.6            98.7
Video      12.8 +/- nan         55.2              89
X          89.7 +/- nan          494            52.8
Burn        400 +/- nan         1004            20.1
Write      49.2 +/- nan          343            67.2
Read       4.14 +/- nan         56.7            96.7
Compile     551 +/- nan         1369            15.4
