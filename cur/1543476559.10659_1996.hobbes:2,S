Concerning the use of __ipc_pid_t in the userland exported msq_ds structure:
This is not really too much of a problem.  Since the msq_ds structure
contains 4 fields (msg_first, msg_last, wwait, and rwait) that are only
used in the kernel these can be used to pass back extended (ie: 32 bit)
msg_cbytes, msg_qbytes, msg_lspid, and msg_lrpid values to userspace.
I posted a patch that removed the 4056 byte msgsnd restrictions on Linux
by using vmalloc/vfree for "large" messages, and included in this was just
what I have described above (for the msg_qbytes and msg_cbytes) fields.
Alan Cox has included this in his ac patches, but it doesn't appear that
Linus feels like including this in 2.2.
I posted a second patch that also handled the 16 ipc_pid_t limitation
and cleaned up a couple things in the first patch.
If anybody is interested I can put together a consolidated patch set (along
with the libc changes to take advantage of them) and repost them.  All
together the changes required are pretty minimal.
Unless Linus actually has a problem with my changes (I never got any feedback
on them, except that he had trouble extracting the mime attachment the
first time I sent it to him) this will likely end up in 2.4, along with
whatever other 32 bit UID changes others make.
