Hello all,
I want to know in detail about , what the events (epoll or /dev/poll or
select ) achieve in contrast to  thread per client.
i can have a thread per client and use send and recv system call directly
right? Why do i go for these event mechanisms?
Please help me to understand this.
Thanks in advance,
Arunachalam
