The problem is that this wouldn't cover the more painful problems
such as hardware specific problems.
As Fedora kernel maintainer, I frequently get asked why peoples
sound cards stopped working when they did an update, or why
their system no longer boots, usually followed by a
"wasnt this update tested before it was released?"
The bulk of all the regressions I see reported every time
I put out a kernel update rpm that rebases to a newer
upstream release are in drivers. Those just aren't going
to be caught by folks that don't have the hardware.
The only way to cover as many combinations of hardware
out there is by releasing test kernels. (Updates-testing
repository for Fedora users, or -rc kernels in Linus' case).
If users won't/don't test those 'test' releases, we're
going to regress when the final release happens, there's
no two ways about it.
