Subject: Linux poll(2) functionality difference from Solaris (10)

I am coding first rounds usually on Linux, but I do try to verify
everything on several other UNIXes.
During this port debugging I realized that on Solaris the
poll(2) result flags return POLLEOF without POLLIN on files
that have EOF condition for reading.
In same situation the Linux 2.6.15 returns POLLIN, but I don't
know if there is also POLLEOF.  (Same with 2.6.9 at vger.kernel.org)
To track the issue, I did enter it also into Kernel Bugzilla:

/Matti Aarnio  -- Now VGER could run more than 1000 parallel
outgoing SMTP sessions.  (Not that it really needs to.)
