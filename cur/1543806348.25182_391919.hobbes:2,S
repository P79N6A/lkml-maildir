Faulty, because we are currently running a legacy solution to workaround an 
8,16,(32) arch bits address space limitation, which does not exist in 
64bits+ archs for most purposes.
Trying to defend the current way would be similar to rejecting the move from 
16bit to 32bit. Do you remember that time?  One of the arguments used was:  
the current way works pretty well so far.
The advice here would be:  wake up and smell the coffee.
There is a lot to gain, for one there is no more swapping w/ all its related 
side-effects.  You're dealing with memory only.  You can also run your fs 
inside memory, like tmpfs, which is definitely faster.  And there may be 
lots of other advantages, due to the simplified architecture applied.

If you didn't understand it's meaning.  The shortest path meaning accessing 
hw w/o running workarounds; using 64bits+ to fly over past limitations.

Uhh?
The point here is: Even if there were 64bit archs available in the past, this 
did not mean that moving into native 64bits would be commercially viable, 
due to its unavailability on the mass-market.
So with 64bits widely available now, and to let Linux spread its wings and 
really fly, how could tmpfs merged w/ swap be tweaked to provide direct 
mapped access into this linear address space?
Thanks!
