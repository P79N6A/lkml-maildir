No it doesn't -- it will just crash if a caller does that. If it's a real 
problem then you either need to fix the callers or change add_timer_on()
to transparently put it onto another CPU.
I don't think it's a real problem though because CPU offlining does
a stop machine and that should take care of most such races.
