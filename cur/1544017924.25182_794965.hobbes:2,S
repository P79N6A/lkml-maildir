Sure, ssh test done on /dev/sda
queue_depth=31 (default)
/sys/block/sda/queue/iosched/slice_async_rq = 1
/sys/block/sda/queue/iosched/quantum = 1
I/O scheduler        runt-min (msec)   runt-max (msec)
cfq (default)             523              6637
cfq (s_rq=1,q=1)          503              6743
It did not do much difference.
