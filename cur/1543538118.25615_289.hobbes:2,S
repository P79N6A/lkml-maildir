I'm no longer getting the hda: lost interrupt messages, playing mp3
files doesn't result in extreme "stuttering" and, most importantly to
me, I don't get timeouts while burning CDs.  That last problem may have
been due to hardware problems anyway.  I made a couple of changes, after
which, my CD burning problems went away.  It could have been a bad IDE
cable.
I'm not stressing the VN subsystem, and I don't have the things which
seem more likely to cause problems such as PCMCIA, NFS, etc.  The system
does seem more responsive, so thanks.
