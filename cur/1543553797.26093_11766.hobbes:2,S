Mainly so you can "modprobe -t net \*" and load all modules with /net/
in their pathname.  pcmcia modules need to be identified and linked.
mkinitrd also needs paths to identify scsi modules.  The old system of
assigning pathnames was manual, fragile and error prone, copying the
kernel tree works.  But whether modules are a flat directory, a
manually built two level directory or a copy of the kernel tree, it
still makes no sense to have duplicate names in the same kernel tree.
