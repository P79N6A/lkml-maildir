Yes. Especially as the actual clone() we're waiting for was this 
one:
31342 clone( <unfinished ...>
31342 <... clone resumed> child_stack=0, flags=CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID|CLONE_CHILD_SETTID|SIGCHLD, child_tidptr=0x416dbc18) = 31346
which wasn't the detached one at all. I looked at the wrong clone().

Anyway. It's interesting to see who gets the SIGCHLD (which is why I 
looked at the wrong clone) - that goes to 31340:
	31346 exit_group(0)                     = ?
	31340 --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
	31342 waitpid(31346,  <unfinished ...>
which is just because we send a thread-group signal, so the signal isn't 
actually necessarily directed toward the "real parent".
But the real parent _should_ have been woken up by __wake_up_parent().  
And I don't see why that wouldn't happen.
