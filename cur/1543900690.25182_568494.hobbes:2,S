Ok, I seem to have been miscommunicating here. the old combined 
suspend/hibernate took everything to the hibernate state even if you only 
needed to suspend.
I was still seeing two diffent states involved
for suspend go to low-power mode
for hibernate go to low-power mode, kexec the new kernel, do your stuff, power off
note that this doesn't really matter as you have pointed out in other 
messages that we don't really want to put things in low-power mode, and 
Eric pointed out that kexec already handles disabling devices, so it 
sounds like this may be a solved problem if he's right and an issue to be 
solved differently if he's not.
