That's a much better explanation than can be found in the changelog.
The changelog effectively says: this commits makes a few (new) functions 
static; oh, and by the way, let's delete the old function _because it is 
unused and ugly_.
Well, I've shown that the first is not true and the second by itself is 
absolutely not sufficient reason to remove an exported function that has 
long been part of the kernel.
I would probably have started this thread differently if the removal had 
been done in a separate commit and had included the explanation you give 
above.

The problem here is that it may be a simple change for you and other 
similarly gifted people, but it's something that's above _my_ skills.

I did actually manage to create such a patch for the breakage in the 
VirtualBox source because of 2.6.24, but those really were very minor 
issues (basically overlapping definitions). I posted that on their user 
list (to which I am subscribed), but I never saw any response to it.
I also don't think it is really realistic to expect Innotek to provide 
patches for unreleased kernel versions. Maybe some other user could provide 
me with the patch, but I'm not as confident as you are.
My point still is that I feel they should not have to. That it's also the 
kernel developers responsibility to ensure backwards compatibility or at 
least a grace period for conversion whenever possible.
And IMO that not only goes for user-space API, but also for interfaces used 
by out-of-tree kernel modules.
Is it really impossible in this case for example to rewrite the old function 
so that it becomes a wrapper around the new interface? If it is impossible, 
then so be it.

I haven't seen anything on the user mailing list yet...

If you can give me a link to that patch, I'd be grateful. As I said, I'm 
subscribed to their user list but have not seen any patch there.
I've also googled for it, without result.
I've also just quickly checked their "VirtualBox on Linux" forum, but did 
not see any obvious existing post about it.
