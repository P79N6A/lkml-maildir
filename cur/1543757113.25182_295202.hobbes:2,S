If it is, IBM's OS/360 and OS/VS1 and MVS had prior art way back in the 70's.
There were *plenty* of products that would look at the system call usage and
spit out an ordered load list for SYS1.LINKLIB and SYS1.LPALIB - so the idea of
machine-optimizing the list of things to cache for a fast startup is *not*
new.
I'd not be surprised to find out that somebody did something like that on the 7094 ;)
