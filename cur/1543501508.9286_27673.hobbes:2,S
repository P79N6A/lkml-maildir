	Hi,
I have sad news for all reiserfs adicts : Hans broke both legs this 
morning. He is at the hospital and is going well. This is not a serious 
injury but he won't be able to walk for a few weeks.
You won't be surprised to learn that the first thing he asked for was to 
have his machine in his room :-) The machine is installed but not yet 
connected to a modem. You will have to wait a few days before 
receiving news from Hans.
Keep the flame,
Loic
