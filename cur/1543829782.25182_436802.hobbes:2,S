A cleaner approach would be to define a local symbol that spelled out
the dependencies. Something like
# Used because ....
config RADIO
	depends on ISA && (VIDEO_V4L1 || VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT)
config RADIO_CADET
	tristate "ADS Cadet AM/FM Tuner"
	depends on RADIO
The variable name RADIO is awfully bad but you get the idea..
