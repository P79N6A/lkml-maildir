Hey Gene,
	I know we've spoken before about a few timekeeping problems, but
sometimes I have a hard time keeping all the issues straight. Have you
filed a bug on this issue? I queried for your email in
bugzilla.kernel.org and I couldn't find anything. If not, would you mind
opening a bug describing the behavior you are seeing with the different
boot options (possibly also dmesg output for both configurations)? It
will greatly help make sure this doesn't slip by without notice.

Hmmm. Indeed the nforce2 has had a number of problems, but I'm not sure
why it would have changed recently. Can you bound at all the kernel
versions where it worked and where it broke? Additionally, do be sure
you have the most recent BIOS, I've seen a number of nforce2 issues be
resolved with a BIOS update.

I don't think the NTP changes would have triggered this, but I want to
be sure (its more likely something else in the timekeeping code is
causing problems).

The testing and problem report is very much appreciated! Start with
filing a bugzilla bug and then I'll point you at a few more mines to
checkout :)
thanks
