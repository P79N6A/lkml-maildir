Hi 
I have an alpha DS10 with 384Mb, sym53c875 running 2.2.10-ac12. Its only
task is to provide www cache proxy using squid, the caching is divided
into 2 hard disk.  After some days running the following message appears
and the machine crashes, I make the file system again and after same day
it crushes again. I've tried changing disks and controller, putting less
load on it but nothing help.
Any suggestions?
antarctis kernel: Kernel panic: EXT2-fs panic (device sd(8,5)):
load_block_bitmap: block_group >= groups_count - block_group = -1,
groups_count = 567
PD: for the machine to boot I had to reverse core_pysix.c after apply
ac-12
