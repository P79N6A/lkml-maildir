   What comes to mind first is a replacement for f_op->read() that
   returns the VFS buffers themselves rather than copying file data to
   a buffer supplied by nfsd. That would get us a considerable speedup
   on the READ case, because that would eliminate the last memcpy in
   the code path (except for the skb to ethercard copy).
It sort of exists, you can do this with sendfile, it goes straight
from the page cache to the socket, one copy.
I assume you are meaning the "knfsd serves file to client" case when
you say "read".
The one issue is to get the RPC reply header tacked onto the front.
It is doable with TCP (with the TCP_CORK socket option) but no such
mechanism exists for UDP.
