Hello,
I've had a hard time at work trying to install 2.6.1 on a ASUS P4P800 
motherboard
(whith RAID controller _disabled_ in the bios).
I constantly got "irq 11: nobody cared!" message, which I now see is a 
known problem
here.
After many (many!) tries whith different compilation/boot-time options, 
whith
both 2.6.1 and 2.4.24, I just realized that Debian Woody's (3.0r1) bf24 
kernel
(2.4.18) boots flawlessly.
I thought that possibly this might be a hint for the experts on the list.
cheers,
    Carlo Salinari
