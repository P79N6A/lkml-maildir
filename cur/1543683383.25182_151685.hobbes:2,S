This is a good point to remember, especially since you
contradict it later on in your own mail.
Making a program to extract data from a bitkeeper
repository is fine. It is covered by this interoperability
clause.
What is arguably (not) fine is making a program that does
everything bitkeeper does and does it in the same way, ie.
creating a bitkeeper clone.
However, that has nothing to do with a program that can
extract data from a bitkeeper repository but quite clearly
isn't a bitkeeper clone...
