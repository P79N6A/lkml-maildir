Well, you could put .config in it too.
Frankly, a filesystem that:
- can be somehow linked with vmlinux and not separate like an initrd
- editable post vmlinux-linking
- gives files that can be accessed from request_firmware, acpi and
  friends even rather early in the boot process (i.e. well before any
  userland is allowed to exist)
- accessible post-boot through mounting of a special fs and/or /proc or something
would be quite useful.
  OG.
