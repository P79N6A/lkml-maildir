The kernel should not be saving a PID.  The kernel should be sticking  
a pointer to a struct task_struct somewhere (with appropriate  
refcounting) and using that.

I agree.  This is one of the things I really liked about the recent  
mutex patch; it added a lot of checks to various codepaths to verify  
at both compile time and run time that the code was correct.
My personal opinion is that we need to add a new race-free API, say  
open("/proc/fork"); that forks a process and returns an open "process  
handle", essentially a filehandle that references a particular  
process.  (Also, an open("/proc/self/handle") or something to return  
a current-process handle)   Through some method of signaling the  
kernel (syscall, ioctl, some other?) a process can send a signal to  
the process referenced by the handle, check its status, etc.  A  
process handle might be passed to other processes using a UNIX-domain  
socket.  You would be able to dup() a process handle and then  
restrict the set of valid operations on the new process handle, so  
that it could be passed to another process  without giving that  
process access to the full set of operations (check status only, not  
able to send a signal, for example).
Obviously we would need to maintain support for the old interface for  
some period of time, but I think the new one would make it much  
easier to write simple race-free programs.
