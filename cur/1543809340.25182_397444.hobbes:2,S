However it is a C++ application, and I don't know about other people, but for 
various historic reasons I'd rather use C for a command-line application. And 
it isn't free of the masochism related to cdrecord as, the last time I 
checked, cdrdao used libscg.
Now, with that out of the way... cdrdao, in my experience, supports all the 
features, but the last time I used it the documentation for the layout files 
format was scarce and I was unable to figure out how to use it to write an 
ISO file to a disc.
