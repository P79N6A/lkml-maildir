that can't work either, the client can't take the lock, rsync is a
readonly thing. the create lock update repo, remove lock will all three
run during the client rsync. the "exist LOCK" will never notice.
unless you want to use snapshots etc.. the seq lock is the only viable
way to checkout coherent with rsync.
