Yes, but it still eats the memory if loaded.

Please stop beating a dead horse and diverting this discussion to irrelevant
implementation details.
What we were (and should be) discussing are the interfaces. If you have
any sound arguments against the current interface, speak up.
Whether the interface leads to code duplication is neither yours nor
mine to judge -- the only people who should care are the maintainers
of the drivers and they seem to be happy with the current approach
and they are willing to improve it to simplify scanning.
				Have a nice fortnight
