Yes, it definitely should.

Put it this way: If the missing memory barrier in srcu_read_lock() after
the atomic_inc call isn't needed, then neither is the existing memory
barrier after the per-cpu counter gets incremented.  Likewise, if a memory
barrier isn't needed before the atomic_dec in srcu_read_unlock(), then
neither is the memory barrier before the per-cpu counter gets decremented.
What you're ignoring is the synchronize_sched() call at the end of
synchronize_srcu(), which has been replaced with smp_mb().  The smp_mb()
needs to pair against a memory barrier on the read side, and that memory
barrier has to occur after srcu_read_lock() has incremented the counter
and before the read-side critical section begins.  Otherwise code in the
critical section might leak out to before the counter is incremented.
