  Nevermind.  I realized I was being an idiot.  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth.
  Basically, if we have a page that get_user_pages() returned to us, the only
way any part of the PGD/PUD/PMD maping hierarchy can be missing is if the page
is the ZERO_PAGE().  Thus I can use this to detect my ZERO_PAGE() failure mode.
  Thanks for your help!
