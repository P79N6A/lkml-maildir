I see.  This causes the page cache read flush_dcache_page() call
not to trigger.
I was very confused by the fact that this bug was explained by
saying that "the shared mmap list that flush_dcache_page() checks".
So the idea is that VM_SHARED should be set based upon whether
we mmap() the thing writable _not_ whether the open() was done
with write permission enabled.
Yes, I agree with that.
