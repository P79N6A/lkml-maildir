   The first part is easy enough:
   1) It does it in the first place.
   2) It kills the system instead of keeping it running. It nukes
unimportant processes like init, syslogd, klogd, atd, crond, inetd, smbd
but let important processes like netscape keep running so that it can
allocate more memory.

   It _is_ off by default. Which leads me to ask: How can the kernel need
to kill random processes to free memory when /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
= 0? It sounds like a bug to me.
