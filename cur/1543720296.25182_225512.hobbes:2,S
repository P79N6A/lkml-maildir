At the risk of being flamed, here is an explanation.
If you, at the kernel command line, type "init=/bin/bash", the bash
shell will be used _instead_ of the regular init program. This is very
useful when you made a mistake in the inittab, something deleted your
root entry in passwd/shadow, your filesystem is in trouble and in many
other cases.
This also means that there will be no other program run before or after
bash. All you get is a prompt.
This means the keyboard will have to work without any setup - or you
won't be able to type in anything, like a command to run the daemon, or
a command to insert a module.
