	Full scan of filesystem. And it's the only way. Kinda kills the
idea... Besides, you'll have pretty races between such scan and rename().
Raceless way to do it from userland simply doesn't exist. From the
kernel... It will be equally slow and would take mind-boggling amount of
locking to prevent races. In effect you'll have to stop all
namespace-related activity for the duration of that operation. And it will
not be fast - on a big fs it may take tens of seconds for each file.
