No. If you need RTOS you need RTOS (RTLinux or RTAI).

BUGS
       The current implementation of nanosleep is  based  on  the
       normal  kernel  timer mechanism, which has a resolution of
       1/HZ s (i.e, 10 ms on Linux/i386 and 1 ms on Linux/Alpha).
       Therefore, nanosleep pauses always for at least the speci-
       fied time, however it can take up to  10  ms  longer  than
       specified  until  the  process becomes runnable again. For
       the same reason, the value returned in case of a delivered
       signal  in *rem is usually rounded to the next larger mul-
       tiple of 1/HZ s.
       As some applications  require  much  more  precise  pauses
       (e.g.,  in  order to control some time-critical hardware),
       nanosleep is also capable of short high-precision  pauses.
       If  the process is scheduled under a real-time policy like
       SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, then pauses of up to 2 ms will  be
       performed as busy waits with microsecond precision.

You can play some tricks but basically if you need RTOS you need RTOS.
Linux is not an RTOS.
