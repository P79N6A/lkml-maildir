I agree some people have some inflated ideas about a desktop workload,
but I'd just point out that if your mp3 player was using say 2% CPU,
it should be able to preempt the make soon after it becomes runnable,
and not have to wait at the end of the queue. It would become a CPU
hog itself if you had 48 other processes running though.
