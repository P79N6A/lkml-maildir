Let's put it this way. "They" must be leaving the cracked systems
in good shape with no changes in any important files. So good for
them. If a tree falls in the forest, and there is nobody there to
hear it.....

We have 9 divisions with 9 sysadmins who do maintenance part-time.
Their main jobs are engineering, not administration. Most of the
other engineers know the root passwords for machines they work with.
The only 'security' feature is that root passwords (we also have
some VAXen -system passwords) are required to be changed weekly.
Most of us use hexadecimal longwords, i.e., 0xfeedface, 0xdeadfeed,
as passwords. They are not alowed to spell anything like these
do. They are easy to remember, but hard to guess because they don't
mean anything.

[SNIPPED rest for brevity]
We once had a "staff sysadmin". We also once had a "security manager".
They left sometime ago after turning our tools into rocks. They were
never replaced.
