Ok, fair enough ;)

I think this is a fair request.
IMO a good start would be to get BK to export its metadata for each 
changeset in XML.  Once that is accomplished, (a) nobody gives a damn 
about BK file format, and (b) it is easy to set up an automated, public 
distribution of XML changesets that can be imported into OpenCM, cvs, or 
whatever.

I am sorry for the misunderstanding then.  Let me quote from an email I 
sent to you yesterday:
	A BK exporter is useful.
So I think we do agree :)

Yes.  As you see, I care about the future and not the present, in my 
arguments:  I believe that a BK clone may hurt the overall [future] 
effort of creating a good quality open source SCM.  So, in my mind I 
separate the two topics of "BK exporter" and "future BK clone."
To get back to the topic of "BK exporter", I think it is more productive 
to get Larry to export in an open file format.  I will work with him 
this week to do that.  Reading the BK format itself may be interesting 
to some, but I would rather have BitMover do the work and export in an 
open file format ;-)  Reading BK format directly is "chasing a moving 
target" in my opinion.
