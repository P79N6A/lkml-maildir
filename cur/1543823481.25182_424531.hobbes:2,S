Subject: [GIT PATCH] SPI patches for 2.6.17-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/16/320

Here are some patches for 2.6.17-rc4 for the SPI subsystem that have
been sitting langushing way too long in my tree and in the -mm tree.
They are all self-contained and fix some SPI issues and add a new SPI
driver.
They also name David Brownell as the SPI maintainer, and he'll handle
getting patches to you from now on (either through Andrew or directly,
they will work that out.)
Please pull from:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/spi-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/spi-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-kernel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
