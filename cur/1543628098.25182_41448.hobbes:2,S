We gave up using kt266A chipset motherboards with anything faster than ATA100.
I can reproduce disk corruption within 30 seconds on any of the KT266A 
motheroards we've tried that have a highpoint 370/372/372a either onboard 
or on the RocketRaid133 controller.
Did not get the corruption when using ATA100 or slower (e.g. promise 
fastrak 100 tx2).
Simple program that writes 1.2 gig to a file and reads them back (checking 
the value) will find corruption every time on these boards, and I tried 5 
motherboards (2 asus, 3 abit).
We switched to Intel I845 chipset and to AMD MPX chipset and haven't seen 
the problem.
I thought this problem was linked with the VIA chipset PCI latency issue as 
people were having the problem with high speed framegrabbers as well.
