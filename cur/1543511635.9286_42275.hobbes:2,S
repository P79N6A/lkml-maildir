You heretic! 
Actually it seems somebody is already doing something similar to the
/proc/usb/dev idea above. The ALSA drivers do something like this (I
am pretty sure) in /proc/asound/dev.
Yes, it's horribly ugly, but what other option do developers have? I
am sure we all know what happened when somebody suggested a neat and
all encompassing solution :-/
