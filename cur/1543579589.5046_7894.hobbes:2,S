Hi HJ,
Could you clarify this? Don't forget that we only send the ping after
a major timeout (usually after 3 or more resends).
IOW: If the ping gets through, then it'll have cost us 1 RPC request,
which is hardly a major contribution when talking about timescales of
the order of 5 seconds which is what that major timeout will have cost
(Don't forget that RPC timeout values increase geometrically).
I'm not touting this as a cure for incorrect rsize/wsize settings. I
use it rather to avoid false 'server is not responding' due to server
congestion. On the current RPC code, the latter can occur sometimes
even with a loopback NFS mount when, say, kflushd is busy hogging the
disk...
Cheers,
  Trond
