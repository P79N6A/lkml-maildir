Because the 2nd user is still using the module so its in-use bit
should still be set.  Remember that when the module was first loaded
it registered a function with the kernel for testing whether the
module is in use.
I must be overlooking something because I see the answer so clearly.
Maybe if someone could give me a real world example of a situation
where it'd be hard/impossible/unsafe to unload a module and I'll see
if my ideas can be applied.
