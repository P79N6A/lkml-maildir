Here is the issue.  In the sparc64 C calling conventions, it is
assumed that 32-bit signed values are sign extended by the
caller.
This means that, at syscall invocation time, we have to choose
between either:
1) sign extending all syscall args for the C code, then explicitly
   zero-extending all non-signed syscall args.  This would require
   the most amount of compat layer code help.
2) zero extending all syscall args for the C code, then expliticly
   sign-extending all signed syscall args.
3) some mixture of 1 and 2
#3 is what sparc64 does, it hits the highest number of system
call arguments correctly.  Specifically we:
arg0: zero-extend
arg1: zero-extend
arg2: zero-extend
arg3: zero-extend
arg4: leave as-is
arg5: leave as-is
I remember discussing this with Andi Kleen before.
Each platform is going to behave differently in this area, so
I suppose the right thing to do really is to have the arch
specific code use little zero/sign extender stubs when necessary
so that the compat layer can assume that the args are properly
sign/zero extended already.  I guess this is how I'll fix this
up on sparc64 for now.
