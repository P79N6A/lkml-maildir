I talked with Matt Robinson(sp?) at LinuxWorld-NY about LKCD for a few
minutes...  he gave me the impression that a lot of progress has been
made recently.  IBM apparently has some guys working on it, too.
I've always thought Linux needs industrial strength crash dumps like the
other Unices.  There are many benefits, but my own is self interest: 
bug reports get 1000 times better, since you get along with the crash
point a lot more info about the state of the system at the time of the
crash.
So, I hope LKCD is looked upon favorably by the Penguin Gods. :)
