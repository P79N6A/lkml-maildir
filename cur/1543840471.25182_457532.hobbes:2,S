Hi Jeff,
the IBM eHEA Device Driver has been discussed on the netdev, linux-ppc and 
kernel mailing list for some time. The latest patch set we posted can be
found at:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg12820.html
As the discussion seems to have settled, please consider our driver for
upstream inclusion.
Thanks,
Jan-Bernd Themann & Christoph Raisch
