Oh man - it's java too:
http://pero.blogs.aprilmayjune.org/
they also suggest 1024, independantly of everyone else by the looks of
things.
   "A day and several installation routines later we figured out that
    the available epoll resources were not sufficient any more. Java JDK 1.6
    uses epoll to implement non-blocking-IO. With kernel 2.6.27 resource
    limits have been introduced and the default on openSuSE is 128 - way too
    low."
How many more people's wasted days is it going to take to convince you
that it's broken as currently implemented?
