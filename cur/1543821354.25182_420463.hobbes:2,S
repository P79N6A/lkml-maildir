Hi Geoff,
I've been ignoring this discussion, but now that I read it I think this
is all kinda backwards.
PPC_CELL should not denote !SOME_HYPERVISOR, it should just mean "basic
cell support", ie. PPC_CELL gets you platforms/cell built in.
Then we can have SOME_HYPERVISOR which _adds_ support for that
hypervisor. And PPC_CELL_BLADE which selects things which are actually
specific to that hardware, like SPIDERNET etc.
But SOME_HYPERVISOR should not remove support for running on bare metal,
it should just give you the option of running on the hypervisor. Yes
that may require testing things at runtime, that's what
firmware_has_feature() is for.
The goal should be that we have one kernel which can boot on all Cell
implementations. In fact the ultimate goal is to have one kernel that
can boot any platform under powerpc, that's a way off still, but we
don't want to start going backwards.
cheers
