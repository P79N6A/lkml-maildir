> Well, Qlogic also has their firmware released in binary format.
Firmware that runs on the processor in the card is somewhat of a different
item. If its just a binary firmware image to load into the card and that
is run by the card I dont think its an issue.
If its code run on the host processor then there is an issue.
A good rule of thumb test for that is "could you write a seperate program
that loaded the firmware and wasnt part of the kernel".
