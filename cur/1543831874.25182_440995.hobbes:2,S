Very good point. My manpages have led me astray to the dark side. :)

Yikes, I think sticking the OR operator in there would seriously suck,
given that programs would then be unable to poll on more than 256 file
descriptors (which actually happens, or so I've heard). Besides, it
would also kill Tigran's work, as per the comment from the top of
select.c:
012  *  24 January 2000
013  *     Changed sys_poll()/do_poll() to use PAGE_SIZE chunk-based allocation
014  *     of fds to overcome nfds < 16390 descriptors limit (Tigran Aivazian).

Arguments of the cited standard's sensibilities notwithstanding (given
that it seems silly to limit the API in unnatural ways, as we can easily
and provably handle more than 256 fds), it seems better to leave this as
is. Thanks for the critical eye. :)
