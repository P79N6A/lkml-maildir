Hi,  
today I experienced some system freezes under heavy IO load. I was moving my  
~20GB / to another partition. The system simply stopped responding (twice)  
when I was copying /usr. Unfortunately the freeze was pretty hard, and no  
clues could be gathered from the system logs. Neither ssh-ing from another  
machine worked. I tried with kernels 2.6.8.1-mm3 and 2.6.9-rc1-mm1, same  
behaviour: no hard disk activity and complete freeze.  
The two partitions are reiser4, so I'm CCing this message also to  
reiserfs-list.  
I don't think it is a FS related problem, though. Firstly because doing  
exactly the same thing on another machine worked ok (I tried 3 times).  
Secondly because of some cryptic messages my system has been giving for some  
time. The message is:  
Aug 28 18:43:00 kurtz __iounmap: bad address dfd00000  
  
This is usually repeated 2 or 3 times. According to my logs this started 
happening with 2.6.8.1-mm1. I had never seen it before. This also appeared 
when I was finally able to copy my partition (on the third try). The system 
hanged on shutdown immidiately after though :-/  
  
I googled around for that message, but found nothing, except for some lkml 
activity at the 2.5.25 time and some recent SATA bugs. This hard drive is not 
SATA though. This is the output of my lspci:

As you can see the IDE subsystem is from ALi. This is an HP laptop which has 
never shown any kind of instability. Also smartmontools say that the hard 
drive is ok. The kernel has been compiled with mregparm=3, but aside from that 
no fancy options has been used. I also tried disabling ide IRQ sharing and 
ACPI, still no luck. Can anyone give me some insight in this? If more 
informations are needed, please let me know. 
 
Thanks very much, 
 
  Francesco
