Very cool, though I'm wondering if it wouldn't be more useful to have a
list of check-able struct types...   I am sure that not all struct
initializations need to be gcc-ified.

Generally the macros are in the form of a keyboard macro which I record
as soon as I imagine the change, which makes it very context-specific.
The advantage of the keyboard macros over a script is that I can look at
a section of code and hit <Alt+1> for each change -- after I have
satisfied myself that the change is good and applicable to the section
of code that I am looking at...  the number of errors is greatly reduced
over the "run a script and see what damage I caused" method ;)
