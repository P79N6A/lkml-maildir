This has been done before. ;)
Also, note *VERY* carefully that this does *NOT* protect against buffer overflow
the way ExecShield and PAX and similar do - this merely tries to mitigate the
damage.
Note that you probably don't *DARE* remove open()/read()/write()/close() from
the "permitted syscall" list - and an attacker can have plenty of fun just with
those 4 syscalls.
(That's also why SELinux was designed to give better granularity to syscalls - it
can restrict a program to "write only to files it *should* be able to write").
