hello.
for last 2 weeks i  made a tests with bonnie
with different versions of 2.4.x and 2.2.x
and i have a strange problem i used
for tests 2 PC (exactly the same configuration- HP BRIO-xxxx)
the only differency one PC has 3c509 card another rtl card
and first also has second ide disk.
here the part of dmesg:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: chipset revision 1
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: ST38421A, ATA DISK drive
hdc: QUANTUM FIREBALL1280A, ATA DISK drive
hdd: FX322M, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: 16514064 sectors (8455 MB) w/256KiB Cache, CHS=1027/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdc: 2503872 sectors (1282 MB) w/83KiB Cache, CHS=2484/16/63, DMA
hdd: ATAPI 32X CD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache, DMA
imary IDE
result were strange because for second PC( with 1 disk) all parameters
were 2 times more than for first 
for instance block read 4930/11088 or for block write 8500/12000
i checked hdparm  both use UDMA and configuration options
exactly the same.
My question how to explain this?
Because i am sure that it's possible to explain everything , ok may be
not:)
