i agree with your later points, so this is only a minor nit: why is a 
dynamic decision done by the compiler a 'problem' in itself?
It _could_ _become_ a problem if the compiler does it incorrectly, but 
that's so true for just about any other dynamic gcc decision: what 
registers it opts to use in a hotpath, what amount of loop-unrolling it 
does, what machine-ops it choses, how it schedules them, how it reorders 
them, how it generates memory access patterns, etc., etc. Sure, the 
compiler can mess up in _any_ of these dynamic decisions, with possibly 
bad effects to performance, but that by itself doesnt create some magic 
'dynamic inlining is bad' axiom.
In fact, i believe the opposite is true: inlining is arguably best done 
dynamically. Whether gcc makes use of that theoretical opening is 
another question, but my measurements show that gcc4 does a quite good 
job of it. (It certainly does a better job than what we humans did over 
the last 5 years, creating 20,000+ inline markers.)
and even if we let gcc do the inlining, a global -finline-limit=0 
compile-time flag will essentially turn off all 'hinted' inlining done 
by gcc.

note that one of the patches i did (a small one in fact) does exactly 
that, for x86: i marked all things __always_inline that allyesconfig 
needs inlined.

yes. And this pretty much supports my point: we should flip the meaning 
of 'inline' around, from 'always inline', to at least: 'inline only if 
gcc thinks so too, if we are optimizing for size'.
and i'd be equally happy with making the flip-around even more agressive 
than my first patch-queue did, to e.g. alias 'inline' to 'nothing':
	#define inline
and to then remove inline from all .c level files (and most .h level 
files) as well - albeit this would punish places that use inline 
judiciously.
Even in this case, it is very likely much easier to re-add inlines to 
the few places that really improve from them (even though they dont need 
it in the __always_inline sense like vsyscalls or kmalloc()), than to 
keep the current 'always inline' logic in place and to hope for a 
gradual reduction of the use of the inline keyword...
