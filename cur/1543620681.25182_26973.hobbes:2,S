Subject: APM fix from -pre7 seems to break "Dell laptop support"

With CONFIG_I8K=y and Massimo Dal Zotto's i8k utilities, it's necessary
for me to revert Stephen Rothwell's 2.4.17-APM.1 patch that went into
18-pre7.  If I don't, CPU temperature readings jump around erratically
and the fans come on at the wrong temperatures.  I reported this to
Stephen and on lkml at the time -pre7 came out, but the problem is
still there in -pre9.  If the patch offers real benefits to non-Dell
folk I guess I can just continue reverting...
