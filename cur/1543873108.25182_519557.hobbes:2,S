because it obviously lacks the finess of OpenVZ code :)
seriously, handling the OOM kills inside a container
has never been a real world issue, as once you are
really out of memory (and OOM starts killing) you 
usually have lost the game anyways (i.e. a guest restart
or similar is required to get your services up and
running again) and OOM killer decisions are not perfect
in mainline either, but, you've probably seen the 
FIXME and TODO entries in the code showing that this
is work in progress ...

so that is an option then?
