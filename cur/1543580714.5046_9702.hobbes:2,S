CGI performance isn't directly affected by this - the whole point is to
reduce the "cost" of handling static requests to zero (at least, as close
as possible) leaving as much CPU as possible for the CGI to use.
So sendfile won't help your CGI directly - it will just give your CGI more
resources to work with.
