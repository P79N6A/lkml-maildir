I compiled linux kernel 2.6.11.7 on RHEL and while
rebooting I get this
error message -
Cannot open root device /SCSIGroup00/SCSIVol000
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernelpanic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root
fs on
unknown-block 0,0
This root entry in grub .conf is identical to kernel
image entry 2.6.9 which boots fine. However 2.6.11.7
compiled kernel does not find
/dev//SCSIGroup00/SCSIVol000
Could anyone please suggest what could be going wrong.
