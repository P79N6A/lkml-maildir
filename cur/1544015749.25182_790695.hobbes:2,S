Yes, meanwhile, I have to admit you all are right and I have been
looking in the wrong direction.
My original problem was the following:
- MD raid0 made of some MMC/SD devices
- raid0 activated
- rmmod mmc_host_driver (user error, not noticing the raid is active)
- insmod mmc_host_driver (user error, still not noticing the raid is active)
- write to raid0 device
- kernel crash
I have debugged this a little and found the following reason for the
crash:
When removing the mmc_host_driver, everything seems to be fine; the
MMC/SD block device has been deactivated by mmc_blk_remove(), that in
turn has stopped the queue via mmc_cleanup_queue(). mmc_cleanup_queue()
calls blk_cleanup_queue() on the underlying struct request_queue. By
this, the reference count of the struct request_queues kboj drops to
zero. The MD driver still has the block device open and, actually,
things work fine unless the memory of the struct request_queue isn't
touched, because it is marked dead. Of course, accessing the MD device
returns EIO, but that's fine.
When the mmc_host_driver is reloaded, new struct request_queues will be
allocated and with some probability, the old memory will be re-used for
them or the old memory locations will be re-used for something else. The
key point is that the queues still in use by the MD layer will
effectively no longer be marked dead or completely corrupted.
I don't know if this is a problem of the MD layer, the MMC/SD block
driver, a more general problem or even no problem at all :)
How can this be fixed?
