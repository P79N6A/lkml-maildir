I really wish I could report my oopses, but this is a production box and I
can't just let it sit there while I write down an oops. The syslog
doesn't catch the OOPS except for sometimes the first few lines. Uptime is
very important to me, as you have probably noticed from my rant. I don't
want to use a serial console becuase I don't have another machine in the
vicinity of 20 feet that would be capable of easilly logging kernel
messages.
I've heard about a new patch that lets the kernel dump oopsen to a floppy,
and I'll try it. It scares me that I might accidentally leave a floppy in
the drive that actually has data.
As I said in a previous message to linux-kernel, I'd be happy to maintain
a bug database if that would be within my realm of comprehension (I don't 
know very much about the kernel internals...).
The machine is a Cyrix 6x86MX (no SMP) running RedHat 5.1 with most of the
packages at either 5.2 or 6.0 versions. MTRR is enabled in the kernel but
I haven't used it for anything yet so I would assume that it is not
causing problems. I don't run X. No quotas.
