the update_stats function is only called every two seconds, and scheduled once. I
think that the chance that two of these functions run in contention in the way you
point out are practically zero, and if they do then we have much bigger problems
than just counters being wrong...
the lock is there to prevent an mii-tool PHY read from interfering with the
regularly scheduled PHY reads, so we might want to keep those reads locked
together as Todd suggests himself, but not the bulk MAC reads.
