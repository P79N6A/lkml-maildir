What did I say about moving this discussion from lkml? :-)
[ Well, it's my fault I shouldn't have replied. ]
This is my last mail on this subject with lkml cc:ed, sorry for noise.

Have you followed x86 4kb stacks discussion?

No, they instead should claim support for specific distribution
and specific distribution versions (and some vendors do this).

They can often be solved with some effort (i.e. Intel WLAN driver).

Use Windows then. ;-)  Most bugs (any OS) are *driver* bugs.
The whole thing is about you having control over hardware
(thus drivers) not hardware/software vendor.
Yes, this scares some people. :)

And you are free to do this, just don't bring your problems on lkml
wasting my time.  Reproduce problem without binary modules,
if you can't then bring your problems to the authors of these modules
or pay somebody to debug+solve your problems.

I'm not advocating artificial barriers.  I'm saying that IMO most kernel
developers have _zero_ interest in supporting such interfaces.
My point is that use/write/whatever binary only drivers if you like
but don't waste my and other people time if you have problems.

This list is for development not for politics.
I personally hate kernel politics and try to concentrate on kernel hacking.

Sorry, I can't see how this two things are related.
I'm rather saying that if you buy a turbocharger (binary only module)
and modify your car you shouldn't expect car (kernel) producer to accept
your warranty claims.  [ and remember that you got kernel for free! ]
I think you agree with this :-).
By using binary only module you modify your kernel code (on runtime)
and I can no longer see what really is going on and how do you expect
me to solve your problems?

True, this can be interesting and constructive.
