Exactly. It currently appends " (deleted)", which may even match an
existing file!
E.g.:
$ touch blah "blah (deleted)"
$ perl -e 'open I,blah;unlink blah;sleep 60' &
$ ls -l /proc/`echo $! `/fd/
lr-x------  1 jengelh root 64 Apr 19 21:48 3 -> /dev/shm/blah (deleted)
Note that ls will not colorize the part after ->, since that file actually
exists!
