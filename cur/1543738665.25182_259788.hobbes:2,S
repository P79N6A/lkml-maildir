Well. Here is what I know, so far ..
2.6.9-rc4-mm1 doesn't boot (Bad Page flags)
2.6.9-rc3-mm3 doesn't boot (same issue)
2.6.9-rc3-mm2 works fine.
I don't run anything other than -mm tree for 2.6 :)
I will dig some more tomorrow on whats breaking it.
I am having a bad day today - AMD64 doesn't boot. PPC64 doesn't boot.
I can't test Manfred's alloc_node patch :(
Thanks,
Badari
