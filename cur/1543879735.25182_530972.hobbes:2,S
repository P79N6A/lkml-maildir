  i have no dog in this fight one way or the other.  i was just in a
housecleaning mood and the shaper stuff looked old and relatively
dead, that's all.  if there's a good reason to keep it, fine.
  but it seems fairly clear that this *is* a dead feature:

    [NET]: kconfig, correct traffic shaper
    As Patrick McHardy <kaber@trash.net> suggested, Traffic Shaper is now
    obsolete and alternative to it is no longer CBQ, since its problems with
    virtual devices, alter Kconfig text to reflect this -- put a link to the
    traffic schedulers as a whole.

==================================================
  so given that the discussion of getting rid of this feature started
well over a year ago, coupled with the fact that its own Kconfig entry
has listed it as "OBSOLETE" for over five months now, plus that it has
very few references left in the tree, well, maybe it's not outrageous
to think that it really can be tossed.
  but, like i said, i have no vested interest in this one way or the
other, except for a fondness for getting rid of dead stuff.
rday
p.s.  if it shouldn't be removed, maybe someone would like to add an
entry to the feature removal file for it.
