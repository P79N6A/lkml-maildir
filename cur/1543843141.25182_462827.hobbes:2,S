No, I was just using it today in PIC i386 code.
The %ebx register gets pushed, the needed value
gets moved into %ebx, the int 0x80 is done, and
the %ebx register gets popped. Only a few odd
calls like clone() need something different.
(not that this should be needed: gcc is broken
if it can't save/restore the needed registers)

It's damn useful. Hint: Linux does not require glibc.
I could hack up my own assembly. I did that for clone(),
but I didn't enjoy that waste of my time.
