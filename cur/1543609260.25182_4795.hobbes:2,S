Could someone please help me to understand
the following error messages. They messages 
appeared after upgrading from 256 to 512 MB RAM.
The first boot with the new RAM modules failed.
the system stopped completely, only the "shift lock" 
and "scroll lock" LED where blinking. 
A second boot was fine. I tried a kernel compile
for memory testing :-) and everything seems to
be ok.
But now I get the following messages:
Nov  9 22:47:59 linux kernel: outcommand error 2
Nov  9 22:47:59 linux kernel: commandrequest error
Nov  9 22:47:59 linux kernel: dvb0: ARM crashed!
Nov  9 22:47:59 linux kernel: outcommand error 2
Nov  9 22:47:59 linux kernel: commandrequest error
Nov  9 23:03:49 linux kernel: dvb: 1 dvb(s) released.
Nov  9 23:03:49 linux kernel: free irqs
I looked into the kernel sources but I could 
not even find the word "commandrequest". The
errors happened while loading DVB drivers. 
I'm running a 2.4.10-ac12 kernel on a pentium III
with 512MB RAM.
Some ideas?
thanks, Martin
