This is happening because we have BIO_MAX_SIZE = 64k,
but that particular driver doesn't like requests which are
that big.
This is the issuewhich Adam, Jens and I have been discussing.
Looks like the preferred solution is an add_page_to_bio() API
in the block layer.
But it's not there yet, so in the short-term, please just do
-#define MPAGE_BIO_MAX_SIZE BIO_MAX_SIZE
+#define MPAGE_BIO_MAX_SIZE 16384
in fs/mpage.c
