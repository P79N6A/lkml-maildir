hm, well, a thought, maybe udev should report what is doing, like
printinig "renamed eth0 to eth2", or such.
the problem with this device renaming in my case was that other software,
in particular dhcpcd, didnt get any lease, because (obviously?) dhcpcd
on the other hand _still_ seemed to look for eth0, and thus, after
booting, there was no network configured at all.
Maybe the name "eth0" is hardcoded in the gentoo init scripts, I dont know.
Can this be considered a distrubtion bug?
cheers,
