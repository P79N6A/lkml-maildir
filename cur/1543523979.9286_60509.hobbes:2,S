I can see the same effect here as well on a laptop (Dell Inspiron 7000). 
USB beeing enabled or disabled in the kernel makes no difference.
However accessing /dev/psaux with gpm or the XServer results in a 
keyboard/mouse lockup with the following error message:
Jan 29 13:46:22 schlepflop kernel: keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?
Logging into the machine and killing the processes results in a properly 
working keyboard.
