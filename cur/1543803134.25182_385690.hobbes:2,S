You probably mean Opteron 285's. or Opteron 280's.

Does memtest86+ support reading of ecc errors on that motherboard,
if it does not, memtest won't tell you anything as the hardware
ecc will correct the errors and memtest will not find anything, if
that version of memtest is ecc aware it will register an ecc error.

Download edac/bluesmoke from sourceforge and compile and install
it, this will monitor ecc errors from linux, and should tell you
if you are getting ecc errors.
If you were running certain other Linux distributions they won't
report mces as they are missing the mcelog program, but the errors
would have been there.

Non-fatal mce's are usually ecc faults, and *USUALLY* track back
to bad memory, though it can also be overheating cpu, or a problematic cpu, 
or rarely the MB could be the fault.
ECC/MCE counts will get worse under load, unless the problem is
really severe you won't see them at idle.
