Not really - if we code it correctly, it'll handle any
value of HZ from 1 to 2^20... you might need #ifdefs
to avoid constant math problems.  e.g. in
       /* Convert timeout from milliseconds into jiffies? */
       if (((unsigned long)timeout) >= (1000*MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT)/HZ))
              timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
       else if (timeout > 0)
              timeout = (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1;
cpp might have a problem evaluating (1000*MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT)/HZ.
