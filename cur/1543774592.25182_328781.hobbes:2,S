No, you want them to look like the same objects that {get|set}xattr() manage
currently.  You don't want programs to have to guess what an EA looks like
this week, with this user's combination of plugins that's different from
everybody else's.

And 'cat crypto/raw/foo' or 'crypto/inflated/foo.gz' gets you what, exactly?
Now throw some .bz2 and .zip files into the mix... ;)

Unless of course the user had done 'mkdir sorted.by.city.zip' to make
a directory of files containing data sorted by USPS Zip code.
And what happens if the user has a file 'bar' that's not a ZIP file,
and a directory 'bar.zip' isn't a view into 'bar'?
Most of the time, if I have a file 'linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2' and a
directory 'linux-2.6.12', what is under the directory is *NOT* the same
data as what's in the .bz2 - I've done 'make oldconfig' and a few builds
and some variable amount of patching, usually with rejects, and I *don't*
want that .bz2 being updated during all this (hint - what's my next command
after 'rm -rf linux-2.6.12' likely to be, and why, and  what expectations
do I have when I do it?)
You want to think this sort of thing through *really* thoroughly, because
there's a *lot* of things, both users and programs, that have expectations
about The Way Things Work.

But now instead of having to remember the one meme "I can manage any
compressed-archive format that's stored in a file, and put other files in it,
and all I need is the appropriate userspace tool", they have to remember "the
cp trick works for .zip and .tar, but I'll get a "not a directory" error if I
try it with a .hqx file, and that other file format may or may not work,
because I can't remember if this kernel has a working out-of-tree module for
this kernel...."
