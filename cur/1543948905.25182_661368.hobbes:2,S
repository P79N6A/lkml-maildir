It may be the NFSv4 callback thread going down then. It also tries to
unregister with the portmapper and recent patches fixed the reference
counting so that it actually tears things down instead of just leaking
memory and sockets.
I'm not sure what we can do about that other than try to fix it so that
it doesn't try to unregister with the portmapper. It really doesn't need
to since it no longer registers with it.
