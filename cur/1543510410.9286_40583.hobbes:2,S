   sep14.diff doesn't make any difference to the problem.
I haven't followed this thread very closely, so I may be putting my
foot in my mouth, but in order to use any of the CD players I use I
put the following into my bootup scripts for 2.3.x (and I think the
change made to the cdrom driver which causes this problem is
*completely* stupid since it breaks nearly every CD player
application):
echo "0" >/proc/sys/drivers/cdrom/check_media
