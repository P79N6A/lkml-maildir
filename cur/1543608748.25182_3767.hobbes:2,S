Yep.  Once we're seek-bound on metadata and data, the occasional
seek-and-squirt into the journal won't make much difference, and
the other write patterns will be the same.
Interestingly, current ext3 can do a 600 meg write in fifty
seconds, whereas ext2 takes seventy.  This will be related to the
fact that ext3 just pumps all the buffers into submit_bh(), 
whereas ext2 fiddles around with all the write_locked_buffers()
stuff.  I think.  Or the intermingling of indirects with data
is tripping ext2 up.  The additional seeking is audible.
