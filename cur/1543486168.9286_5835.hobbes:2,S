  I am trying to build a two disk boot system.  I feel that the problem is
with the kernel loading a compressed filesystem.  This is what I know.
	1) Boot RH52/rescue and it loads my compressed disk
	2) Boot my kernel and it loads my uncompressed disk
	3) I am using kernel "linux-2.0.36"
	4) Boot my kernel and it can not find any file system on my
compressed disk
	5) /usr/src/linux/.config
		#
		# Additional Block Devices
		#
		# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP is not set
		# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD is not set
		CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y
		CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
		# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_XD is not set
		# CONFIG_PARIDE is not set
		# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD is not set
  I am sure there is a simple solution, but it currently eludes me.
