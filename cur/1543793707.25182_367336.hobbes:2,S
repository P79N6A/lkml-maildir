FS-Cache != CacheFS, although the names are a bit confusing.  FS- 
Cache is a generic cache frontend for filesystems, while CacheFS is a  
provider backend that uses a block define internally.  You could  
_also_ use cache files.  If you look at the [0/12] in the list, you  
can see a diagram explaining this all in detail.
Cheers,

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
