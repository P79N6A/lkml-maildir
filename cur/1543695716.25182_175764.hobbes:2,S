Hi Mr Johnson,
	Thanks for the mail and sorry for pestering you. Actually the
call __setfpucw is not visible anywhere. Should I use 
 _FPU_SETCW(cw) instead of that?
Thanks and Regards
SReeram

With more recent C runtime libraries, the header is
/usr/include/fpu_control.h instead of /usr/include/i386/fpu_control.h
