A "work based on one or more preexisting works [in] any other form in
which a work may be recast, transformed or adapted" sure sounds like
it fits someone compiling software with my symbols in it to me.
Elaboration sure sounds like it fits program code calling my program
code to me.

I'm sorry, I don't think that analysis is correct for software, see
for example: 
http://community.linux.com/article.pl?sid=02/11/13/117247&tid=87&tid=41&tid=12&tid=42,
and Linus' previous explanations as I pointed out in my reply to
Xavier.
At any rate, at the moment I'm getting paid software, not for legal
analysis which I'm not qualified to give. I'm certainly not getting
paid enough to sue anyone, so unless some other kernel hacker or
company is planning on initiating a lawsuit (to which I'd happily
join) it's fairly moot, and I'll let it drop at that.
ciao,
Dave
