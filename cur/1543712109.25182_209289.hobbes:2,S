I've never said that it was impossible, just unwise.  I believe
that a userland approach offers no benefit over allowing the kernel
to perform all meta-data operations.  The end result of such an
approach (given feature and robustness parity with the EMD solution)
is a larger resident side, code duplication, and more complicated
configuration/management interfaces.
