Why?  The lookup op succeeded, so obviously there wasn't anything there,
right?
Note that nfs_lookup_revalidate() doesn't cause the dentry to be revalidated
because the mtime on the parent directory hasn't changed.
I'm considering having nfs_readdir_lookup() mark a negative dentry it
encounters as named in a directory listing for explicit revalidation, but I
can't call nfs_mark_for_revalidate() since I don't have an inode.
I think I'll need to add a dentry flag for this purpose.
