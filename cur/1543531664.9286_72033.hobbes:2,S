In an non-overcommiting system you can be sure your process won't get
SIGSEGV or SIGBUS if it doesn't do anything wrong, and (as long as it is
careful to check and ask for the resources) won't get killed because
memory gets low.
OTOH, as Alan said, the cat might decide to play with the keyboard, or the
overworked sysadmin trip over the power cord, a disk might die or you get
an area-wide blackout. In my humble experience, these "accidents" are way
more probable than a correctely speced machine running totally out of
virtual memory.

That is important in any case. But it is much more fun to troll the list,
and to aim ye olde firebreather at everybody in sight than to code it up.
