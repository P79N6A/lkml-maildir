Do you use LILO?
What you describe happens if you replace the image file but don't run "lilo"
again.
check that you haven't forgot that bit :)

Subject: System Freeze after booting the kernel
--->My Hardware:
P200, 128 Meg Ram, 128 KB Cache on a SuperMicro Board.
Seagate IDE Drive with 13Gig
--->Detailed Report
[1.] Linux freezes after Uncompressing Linux... OK, booting the kernel (no
numlock posssible)
[2.] Wheter I boot with initrd or without, with incompiled reiserfs or as
module or in the initrd I've tried everything
the system freezes after the above given line. I've the same system as
desktop system (the problem occurs on the 'server')
which works fine (Celeron 400 on a Siemens Board with BX440 Chipset, SCSI,
197 Meg RAM)
So what can I do?
