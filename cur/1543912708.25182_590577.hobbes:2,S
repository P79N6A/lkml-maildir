I know there have been some discussions at past OLS about some testing that 
Martin was working on.

But I think this was more functional tests, less unit tests that what you are 
talking/asking about.

Also - If I remember - most of the existing tests were for a self hosted 
environment - and might not be well suited to embedded (like Blackfin) which 
requires cross compile, and pretty thin runtime environment (uClibc + 
busybox's msh as shell).
Martin?
