Now, that kind of "private sharing" should certainly be ok. In fact, the 
only locking there is (doing the ".git/index.lock" thing around any 
updates and erroring out if it already exists) was somewhat designed for 
that. So making it use BE data (preferred just because then you can use 
the existing htonl() etc helpers in user space) would work. 
As long as people don't think this means anything else... It really is a 
private file.
