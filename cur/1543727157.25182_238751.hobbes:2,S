Synaptics requires full reset, reset-disable alone is not enough.
Plus, when synaptics is detected but left in emulation mode, the
driver does synaptics-specific reset which initializes stuff that
survives reset-disable (for example it enables gestures so tapping
is guaranteed to work).
Additionally I think it's a good idea to detect hardware regardless
of the protocol it is using so user can see what he has. 
Anyway, I think that explicitely calling reset-disable after each
failed probe is a good idea... or maybe not after each probe but just
once, before probing for generic protocols (imps/exps), like in the
attached patch.
