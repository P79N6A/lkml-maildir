Yes, I've found out it's 84 for the key besides/below the enter key.

I see...  So it appears the fix has to be done in the kbd package and in
XFree86.
The default console keymap should be changed like this:
 < keycode  84 = Last_Console
 > keycode  84 = backslash        bar
Andries Brouwer appears to be the current maintainer of kbd, so I've
pulled him into our thread.  This is also being cross-postied to
the devel@XFree86.org list.
In addition, I'm going to open two PRs for these packages in RedHat's
bugzilla to make sure the issue gets properly fixed before it hits the
masses.
fyi, this thread was started here:
