Exactly! If you don't have anything useful to contribute WRT tracking 
down
a bug or fixing it, then you are expected to quit wasting the time of 
those
who _do_ have useful information/skills/etc. Jens Axboe has _repeatedly_
asked you for your dmesg so he can determine if it's a bug or not, and 
you
have _repeatedly_ ignored his emails.  Either give us enough information
to identify and fix the issue (if any), or shut up and let Jens Axboe 
work with
people who are willing to provide all necessary information.
Cheers,
