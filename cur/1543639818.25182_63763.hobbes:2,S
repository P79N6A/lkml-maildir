What happens in this case..
person a sends the monkey a patch.
person b replies to l-k (cc'ing monkey) with a "no do it this way" ?
do you have a hand-operated means to say "this patch supercedes the
previous" ?

What would be *really* good, for the case where retransmits are
necessary, if Alan hasn't picked it up for 2.4 (or me for 2.5),
you could add us to the relevant Cc's, (and remove after Alan/Myself
takes it).
This could however get tricky, as the same patch may need a bit
of hand-merging to fit against -ac/-dj.
Maybe just simpler to remove us when Alan/I send an ACK ?

Indeed. It's been a really useful effort, and has picked up
a lot of the smaller bits which have saved me having to push those
to Linus, leaving me free to concentrate on some of the larger bits.
