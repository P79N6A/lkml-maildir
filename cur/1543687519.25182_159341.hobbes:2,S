This can't be the lock_kernel, you see, there's no lock_kernel
invocation at all in the machine_restart_smp path.

kupdate always runs in the background, once every few seconds.
I perfectly see why it hangs on s390, that's a bug in the arch code
and it's unrelated to whatever lock_kernel and even unrelated to the
potential deadlock prone shutdown of cpus that I mentioned in my
previous email:
static void do_machine_restart(void * __unused)
{
	clear_bit(smp_processor_id(), &cpu_restart_map);
	if (smp_processor_id() == 0) {
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
if the `reboot` program doesn't run by luck on cpu 0, it will be the one
that will hang instead of the others. the above check must be changed to:
	smp_processor_id() == reboot_cpu
and you should snapshot reboot_cpu in machine_restart_smp. then it won't
hang anymore.
The x86 code may be safe in hanging in the IPI if it's extremely careful
in not touching any lock that maybe hold by other cpus, between the IPI
delivery and the hard reboot. So probably we don't need to replace the
IPI with a kernel thread in 2.4, despite I find the kernel thread way
more robust.
Overall the lock_kernel I think is _needed_ (not only if something it's
safer), to serialize reboot against reboot and I wouldn't bother
changing it to another spinlock (at least not in 2.4)
