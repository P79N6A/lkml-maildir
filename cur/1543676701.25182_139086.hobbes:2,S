Maybe it's just because I am so familiar with it, but while its size is
big, I don't view it as terribly big conceptually. The patch is big
because diff doesn't handle file renames well. Plus, the great majority
of changes are in drivers/acpi. I would think you could basically ignore
all that code, and focus your review on the other bits. I'd be happy to
split that out into a much smaller, easier-to-review patch if that would
help.

I'm looking forward to its swift arrival.
