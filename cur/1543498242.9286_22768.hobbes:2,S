 I dont know if this is the correct place to post. If it isnt please
redirect me.
 I installed Slackware 4.0 with kernel 2.2.9 and the IP patch.
 The machine worked fine for a week until we installed apache with
 800 virtual web servers. 500 of these are using HTTP 1.0 with an IP
 for each domain. Since then the machine has rebooted every couple
 of hours. I have tried downgrading to 2.2.7. The reboots are strange,
 there are no error messages and it looks like a clean, smooth reboot.
 Finally I downgraded to Linux 2.0.36 and it has been stable ever since.
 My guess is that the code for IP aliasing in 2.2.* is broken. But thats
 just a guess...
 Anyone have any ideas?
 Jonathan
