I agree.  That is the way thing should be :

This would require a growable NR_IRQS to fix.  Something
that we don't have a good handle on at all.  But at least
much less code cares.
If we killed the counters for each pair of cpu and irq this would
not involve the per cpu area at all.  But we still have the one
static array of irqs.  That will be more fun to get rid of.
