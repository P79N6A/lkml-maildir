I only fixed it up because someone at SGI complained that
my ia64 kernel virtual space re-arrangements had broken it
(even more ... it had never been right for ia64).
Even now, it's still full of races (e.g. if you start gdb to
look at /proc/kcore, then load or unload modules).
Plus gdb doesn't really understand that kcore is a special
file, so it caches values (read "jiffies" twice and notice
that it doesn't change ... because gdb cached the read).
So don't mistake my recent activity fixing kcore for interest
in its continued existence.
