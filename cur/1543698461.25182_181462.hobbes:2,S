hm, get_tid_list() is used in proc_task_readdir(), which is
/proc/<TGID>/task/ directory - so proc_task(dir) is a thread group leader
by definition, right?
also, a zombie thread group leader does not mean it's removed from the
thread list - we keep it around hashed just to enable the 'process' to
live along and only release it once the last thread has gone too (by
delaying parent notification up to the last thread has exited).
But this should be irrelevant in this case, i think the crash here is
stale access to the thread leader via /proc/<TGID>, and trying to follow
that non-existent thread list pointer.
