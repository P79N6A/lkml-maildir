Right. In any case, I am still unable to reproduce the OLTP issue and
I've seen SLUB beat SLAB on my machine in most of the benchmarks
you've posted. So I have very mixed feelings about SLQB. It's very
nice that it works for OLTP but we still don't have much insight (i.e.
numbers) on why it's better. I'm also bit worried if SLQB has gotten
enough attention from the NUMA and HPC folks that brought us SLUB.
The good news is that SLQB can replace SLAB so either way, we're not
going to end up with four allocators. Whether it can replace SLUB
remains to be seen.
