Wrong.  The above is by default only true for metadata, not data.  BSD does
sync metadata writes; current flavours can be configured to do this async.
Ext2 on the opposite defaults to async metadata writes and can be configured
to sync metadata writes.
Neither principle can guarantee the consistence of metadata in case of a
crash.  Which makes the dispute which principle is more reliable an excellent
area for flame wars.  Fact is that async updates perform better.
