The dual core NUMA parsing problem could be probably fixed. I personally
have no plans to work on it though, since the ACPI method works fine.
Feel free to submit patches.
However with 90+W CPUs I would strongly recommend having support
for PowerNow! and the old style PST table doesn't support
dual core or SMP, so you need ACPI for that anyways.
