Done. It will be commit 6203554207728f43cfb9fd48585cd6500da73d42 when I 
push out (but please point to the original commit that actually adds the 
check: 6203554 just changes from CAP_NET_ADMIN to CAP_SYS_RAWIO and is not 
as important as adding the check in the first place.
(I don't know of anybody who actually really uses capabilities with 
individual bits, so I seriously doubt it matters)
