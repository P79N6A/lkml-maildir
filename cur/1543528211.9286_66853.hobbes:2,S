  The solution (at least on RH6.0 and RH6.1) for the X problem was
  to change the following line in /etc/security/console.perms from:
  <console>=tty[0-9][0-9]* :[0-9]\.[0-9] :[0-9]
  to:
  <console>=tty[0-9][0-9]* [0-9][0-9]* :[0-9]\.[0-9] :[0-9]
  There is a related problem which stops root logging in on
  a virtual console. The solution was to add the last 8
  lines to /etc/securetty yielding:
  tty1
  tty2
  tty3
  tty4
  tty5
  tty6
  tty7
  tty8
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
ick... this could cause /dev/pty/[1-8] to be deemed secure for root
login. What's really needed is to fix the PAM securetty module. At
the moment it won't parse full paths like /dev/vc/6 - which imo means
pam securetty is broken.
