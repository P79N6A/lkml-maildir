Sure. At the same time, as Maneesh pointed out, this is just an
RFC. The backing store design probably needs quite some work first.

That would not happen in a normal running system often, right ? So,
I don't see the point looking at mem usage after hotplug events.

It should be easy to demonstrate. That is how dentries/inodes
work for on-disk filesystems. If Maneesh's patch didn't work that
way, then the whole point is lost. I hope that is not the case.

IIRC, Maneesh test machine is a 2-way P4 xeon with six scsi disks and savings
are of about 800KB. That is as normal a case as it gets, I think.
It only gets better as you have more devices in your system.
