Hi Dave
YOSHIFUJI Hideaki / 吉藤英明 has suggested that I send the patch
below to fix the ftp stalls present in the current kernels.
All credit goes to Komuro <komurojun-mbn@nifty.com> for tracking
this down. The patch is untested but it looks *cough* obviously
correct.
Signed-off-by: Craig Schlenter <craig@codefountain.com>
Thank you!
