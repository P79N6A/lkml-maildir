I'm using a combination of raid 0/1.  Here is my raidtab:
# Sample raid-0/1 configuration
# setup strip
raiddev                 /dev/md0
raid-level              0
chunk-size              16
persistent-superblock   1
nr-raid-disks           2
nr-spare-disks          0
device                  /dev/sda1
raid-disk               0
device                  /dev/sdb1
raid-disk               1
# second strip
raiddev                 /dev/md1
raid-level              0
chunk-size              16
persistent-superblock   1
nr-raid-disks           2
nr-spare-disks          0
device                  /dev/sdc1
raid-disk               0
device                  /dev/sdd1
raid-disk               1
# start mirror
raiddev                 /dev/md2
raid-level              1
nr-raid-disks           2
nr-spare-disks          0
chunk-size              128
persistent-superblock   1
device                  /dev/md0
raid-disk               0
device                  /dev/md1
raid-disk               1
I didn't change anything about read/write sizes.  If the problem is
raid related, this worries me.  
Thanks
