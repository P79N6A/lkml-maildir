The hi-tech industry can sustain itself just fine selling _hardware_.
Wether it does so from America or elsewhere isn't all that interesting,
although it may be an indication of wich countries that have 
competitive advantages - and which have disadvantages. Open source
software is not a problem here, it certainly takes a bite out of
_software_ markets but the effect is the same on every country. 
It is generally a good thing, not having to pay for software
means more money for hardware (or non-computer stuff.) The money
is still spent though - so no ill effects for the economy.  But
a nice effect for users - who gets more "other stuff" without 
loosing software.

Isn't that something that you have to have in american business today,
wether you run the FSF or some more ordinary company?

Really?  90% still uses windows, it is not as if paid software 
dwindled much yet . . .

Certainly sustainable.  You can usually not make a living programming free
sw _only_, but there is support, there is hw sales, there is working
with something different having free sw as a hobby only.

Less respect for IP rights - possibly.  Perhaps that's a good thing though,
some of us thinks such rights are a bit overrated.
