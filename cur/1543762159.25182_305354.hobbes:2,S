- Make sure that io-apic is enabled, boot with `nmi_watchdog=1'.
- Make sure that CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP is enabled
- Add `initcall_debug' to the boot command line, see if that tells us
  anything.
- Disable CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, if it was enabled
- Send me your .config.
kgdb is the way to diagnose this one.
