Any Holy IP I might have would be GPL. It's just I know of some that isn't and I
can't understand why it isn't. I'm not looking for legal advise. Just opinions.
Some code is added directly to the kernel source tree. A user land library is
written to access the changes. It is not GPL or LGPL. Simple scenario. No? I
thought so at least.
With all the complex and detailed (way over my head) discussions of the GPL-V2
vs. V3 that the list has had recently, I don't understand how something so
simple as this scenario would require legal advise to know if it were OK or not.
Thanks anyway
Mark
