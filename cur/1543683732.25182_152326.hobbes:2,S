Something else went wrong before you crashed:
bio too big device loop0 (2 > 0)
This means you cannot use any bio larger than zero to this device,
which is probably why ext2 said this, since it caught the error when
building the bio.
EXT2-fs: unable to read superblock
XFS didn't catch the error building the bio and submitted it, at
which point the I/O tripped the BUG. I can fix this part, but
the original problem is something I know nothing about.
