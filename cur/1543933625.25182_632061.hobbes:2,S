Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/7] Fix the ACPI 1.0 vs ACPI 2.0 suspend ordering issue
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/27/70

Hi,
The following patchset is intended to fix the ACPI 1.0 vs ACPI 2.0 suspend
ordering issue described at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9528
 and
in a recent LKML thread (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/25/37
).
The patches actually do more than that, as I think it's reasonable to untangle
some ACPI-specific suspend code by the way.  The details are described in the
changelogs.
The patches apply on top of the suspend branch of the ACPI tree
(git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6 suspend),
but they are also included in the quilt patch series at:
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.24-rc6/patches/
 .
Please review (and test, if possible).
Thanks,
Rafael
