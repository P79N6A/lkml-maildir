Sure.  And seeing that not using hashes would kill performance long
before 4 billion dentries are reached, there don't seem to be many
downsides to hashing in principle.

None of them are 100% correct.  But you are right, -ENOSPC seems to do
less harm.

That would work and is limited to reasonable complexity.  It still
suffers from getting virtually no testing in the wild and therefore
being one of the dark corners little critters thrive in.  But one can at
least add a config option to fold the hash to 16bit or so.  And cross
fingers that at least one person will occasionally test with that
option.

Which brings us back to the start of this thread.
