Why are you obsessed with MTRR's and video cards. The Centaur C6 wants some
of the MTRR's mapping main memory for performance. There are plenty of
other memory mapped cards. Almost any device with a block shared memory
buffer will benefit.

AMD are quite obviously aiming at a standard desktop PC mentality, one MTRR
for the video ram, one for the texture ram, and a seperate MSRR for the RAM
area.
