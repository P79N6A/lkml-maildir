The schedule() in state TASK_RUNNING simply won't do anything unless this
process happens to have been preempted.  You'll find that an ndelay(100) is
about as useful.
So I'd suggest that this part needs a bit of a rethink.  If we really need
to run other processes then try a schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1).  If
not, just remove the loop.
Please stick a printk in there, work out how often and under which
workloads that loop is actually doing something useful.
