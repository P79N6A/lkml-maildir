It's still not right - the assumption that you have 6000 concurrent users
on a 2GB based system is unreasonable. It is much more likely that there
is only 40-50 conccurent users. If the limit is 40 then it becomes 2GB/40
or ~50MB per user not 300K. After that what you have is a management decision
on system expansion, AND the data to back that decision. I have worked in
such an environment, and that's the way it is.

I agree that is is not a problem with the os.
It can also prevent additional logins if the resources for the new login
are not available to the specific user attempting to log in. This is done
in a LOT of UNIX systems, as long as they have functioning, per user,
resource controls.
