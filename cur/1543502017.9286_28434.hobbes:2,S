If you consider a C++ compiler to be just a preprocessor, then every
other compiler is too. The only thing _not_ a preprocessor is a CPU.

C++ template stuff is Turing machine equivalent. I've seen code that,
when compiled, causes the C++ compiler to compute prime numbers.
It was a giant hack, complete with all the normal Turing machine
tape head insanity. You throw away the compiler output.
