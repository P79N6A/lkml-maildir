Well, the tasklet isn't dead yet - it's still running.

Yes, all I'm saying is that one can't rely on tasklet_kill to
make a self-rescheduling tasklet go away, which, given the name,
would seem a reasonably assumption.
Also, in this case, tasklet_schedule behaves differently on SMP.
So I'd suggest to resolve all this by clarifying that
tasklet_schedule must not be called while tasklet_kill is
executing.
