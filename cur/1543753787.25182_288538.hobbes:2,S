Yep. For the DMA zone all slab cache will be a memory pin (like ptes for
highmem, but not that many people runs with 3G of ram in ptes, and I
guess the ones doing it aren't normally using a mainline kernel in the
first place so they're likely not running into it either). While slab
cache pinning the normal zone has more probability of being reproduced
on l-k in random usages.
