Hi,
I have recently acquired a PCI graphics card based on the SIS 6326 chipset.
This chipset supports YUV->RGB conversion, Hardware motion compensation and
iDCT in hardware.  Using Windows 98 and PowerDVD I am able to playback full
screen DVD without any skipped frames on a Pentium 233MMX.  All for the
cheap price of around $US20.
The full specs on this chipset are available at
http://www.sis.com/ftp/Databook/6326/6326ds10.exe
The hardware acceleration of this card does not appear to be supported under
linux, and I am unsure where the code should even go if I was to try and
write it.
I have tried mailing to the livid-devel@linuxvideo.org, as I first thought
this is where the code would belong, but have had no responses at all in 4
days.  Is this Livid/OMS project still alive.
Alternatives (that I am aware of) are
video4linux
fbcon
Xv
Where should this hardware support live, I suspect it does not belong in the
kernel ;) and who should I be talking to.  I am willing to do a lot of the
work to get this chipset supported, but since my device driver experience is
somewhat limited, I would probably need a mentor ;)
Please cc any repies to me as I am not subscribed
Cheers
