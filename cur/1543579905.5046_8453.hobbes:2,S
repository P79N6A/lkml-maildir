Eeek! NO!!!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!
For ECN that would have worked, but that doesn't mean that something
couldn't have been implimented there that wouldn't have worked that way..
I think that older Checkpoint firewalls (perhaps current?) zeroed out SACK
on 'hide nat'ed connections. This causes unreasonable stalls for users on
SACK enabled clients. Not cool.
