It's not that the hardware is deciding to impose restrictions on its
own.  It's the hardware distributor that is deciding to use the
hardware to impose restrictions on the user.  Seems like a violation
of section 6 of GPLv2 to me.

Not quite.  It's more general than that:
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
  exercise of the rights granted herein.

Yes.  The customer gets the copy that TiVO stored in the hard disk in
the device it sells.  And it's that copy that the customer is entitled
to modify because TiVO is still able to modify it.
