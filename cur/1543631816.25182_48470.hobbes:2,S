You're right, I was tripping, I don't know what I was smokng, I know that
code path and they can't be the same.  That said...

Oh, come on, read the code side by side, I'm doing it now (kind of fun, too,
it's been a long time since I've been in here).  If you have BK installed,
or have tkdiff, run that on the two functions side by side.  You're absolutely
right, they aren't identical (what was I thinking?  Shame on me, I've worked
on this code, it's impossible for them to be the same by definition), but
one is clearly an extension of the other.  This is *not* a rewrite.  Or if
it is, I didn't get the memo where they changed the definition of rewrite.
