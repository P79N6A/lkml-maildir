Microwaves. Alarm clocks. Stereos. DVD players. Tivo units. Your car, most
likely, unless it's *so* ancient it predates fuel injection (my '87 Tercel
didn't have any once the radio died.  My '94 Camry has at least 4 that I know
of).
Almost anything that has a display more intelligent than wiring one end of an
LED to ground, the other to +5V (with a 5K resistor in there), and using it as
a "power on" indicator. This includes essentially all multi-segment LED and all
LCD displays.
We *could* itemize all these things, or just generalize to "anything that's
at least as smart as a microwave probably has an embedded CPU".
