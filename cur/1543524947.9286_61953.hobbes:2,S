I'm already using QQ Bios from the day it has been published.
Actually QQ bios was the first one which I could use to at least boot
the idk linux patched kernel with nosmp option.

 , the linux-kernel
I know this one.
But so far there was NO solution for my problems.

It's way to much easy to say its broken hardware....
(Anyway why does linux supports broken Pentiums.... :))

I'm using standard UDMA33 IDE.
Anyway "noapic" currently has solved ALL my problems I had.
(Actually now I'm again starting to believe I don't have to worry about
lockups of my machine - also there is just 1.5% loose in the computing
power so far with noapic option)
I think some other BP6 users might also try this option to see if it helps.
