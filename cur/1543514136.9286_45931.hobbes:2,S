     Am curious what you are doing on that machine..  I've had good luck with
machines sitting idle, this is about a 1 million hit/day web server.  I would
suspect you would have something fairly heavy duty to justify that much RAM. 
Also curious what CPU's you have in that SS-20, maybe is CPU specific (i.e.,
fine with TI sucks with Ross or something along those lines). If all I have to
do to make this thing stable is replace SS-10 with SS-20 chassis I'd do it!
