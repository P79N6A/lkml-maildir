What I do in UML is make a pipe between the parent and child, set it
CLOEXEC, and write a byte down it if the exec fails.
The parent reads it - if it gets no bytes, the exec succeeded, if it
gets one byte, it failed.
child -
	execvp(argv[0], argv);
	errval = errno;
	write(data->fd, &errval, sizeof(errval));
parent -
	socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, fds);
	fcntl(fds[1], F_SETFD, flag);
	pid = clone(child, NULL, SIGCHLD, NULL);
	if(pid < 0){
		...
	}
	close(fds[1]);
	/* Read the errno value from the child, if the exec failed, or get 0 if
	 * the exec succeeded because the pipe fd was set as close-on-exec.
	 */
	n = read(fds[0], &ret, sizeof(ret));
	if (n < 0) {
	} else if(n != 0){
		/* exec failed */
	} else {
		/* exec succeeded */
	}
