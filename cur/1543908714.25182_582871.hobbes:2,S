Ok.

Yes!
in your Kconfig
select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
in your driver.c
#include <linux/genalloc.h>
Code is in lib/genalloc.c, if you like to take a look.
Memory for MANAGING free/allocated space is NOT taken 
from your on-card memory! That allocator is explicitly developed
for such use cases.
Happy hacking!
Best regards
