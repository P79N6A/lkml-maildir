Mine are x305 at 2.66 GHz without HT. Nearly the same.

Suspect things. Eg: if you have one IRQ shared with ACPI or USB. Or
perhaps during traffic, only 3 or the 4 ports getting interrupts, etc...
It would be interesting to determine whether it's incoming traffic,
outgoing or both which cause the trouble. Use 'nc </dev/zero' for this.
Anyway, I really think that running a memtest or trying without HT will
give very useful info.
