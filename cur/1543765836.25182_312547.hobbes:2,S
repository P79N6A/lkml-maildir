To be precise, SELinux assigns security labels to /proc inodes
(/proc/pid inodes are labeled based on the associated task label, and
other /proc inodes are labeled based on the policy configuration), and
controls access based on the policy.  It can e.g. prevent a process in
one security domain from accessing anything under /proc/<pid> for a
process in a different domain, but not from seeing the top-level entry
in /proc itself (as it doesn't do any kind of directory filtering).
