Actually Pavel's i2sig.c works fine for development on x86 as long as
the interrupt is not shared, it's just a bit slow that's all.  If
no-one's got a fast one I guess I will improve i2sig.c
Here is the method, edited for brevity:
MODULE_AUTHOR("Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>");
static int pid = 0;
MODULE_PARM(pid, "i");
static int irq = 3;
MODULE_PARM(irq, "i");
void reenable (unsigned long unused) { enable_irq(irq); }
struct timer_list reenable_timer = {NULL, NULL, 0, 0, reenable};
void interrupt( int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs )
{
	kill_proc(pid, SIGUSR1, 1);
	disable_irq(irq);
        reenable_timer.expires = jiffies + HZ / 50;
        reenable_timer.prev = reenable_timer.next = NULL;
        add_timer(&reenable_timer);
}
