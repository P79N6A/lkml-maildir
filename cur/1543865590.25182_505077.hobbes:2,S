Hi!  Your mail client is monstering your emails to make them fit 70 
cols.  Kinda playing havoc with the diffstats and URLs here and the 
patches in the other emails in this series.  See if you can fix this and 
at least resend the patches in the other 2 emails.  Much easier to 
review then.
Thanks,
Ben.
