These are no questions a user should ever see, and it's impossible that 
a user will be able to choose the right answer - that's an 
implementation detail, and it has to be set correctly automatically 
without bothering the user.
Pro of bigger stacks:
- kernel developers have to care less about stack usage
Pros of smaller stacks:
- less memory usage
- higher order allocations are more likely to fail with fragmented
  memory
We are currently at "works with 8k stacks and without separate IRQ stacks"
and at "works in most situations with 4k stacks", so nothing > 8k should 
be required.
