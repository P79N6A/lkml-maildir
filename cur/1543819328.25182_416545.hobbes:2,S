Yeah , it was a bit confusing .

Something in the code bothered me right around the block you
referenced. 
Specifically when it drops the pi_lock , then takes it again, then does
plist_add to the pi_waiters ( during the "Boost the owner" section in
rt_mutex_adjust_prio_chain() ). Since the pi_lock was dropped you could
get an priority change which would lead to a bogus value in
waiter->pi_list_entry.prio .
I was looking over the code, and it seems like once all the chain
adjusting bottoms out you would end up with the correct priorities in
the waiter structures .. Cause whatever task made the priority
adjustment would just end up resetting the pi_waiters during it's
adjustment process. (Seems like there's room for optimization
though ..)
