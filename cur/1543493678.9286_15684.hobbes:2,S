Hello,
I hope this is not a non-bug. It is definitely strange.
I am using Iomega ZIP 100, ppa. I used it successfuly with 2.1.110 and on
another machine under Windows, so the par port and hardware is okay.
After mounting and accessing the disk a few times, I get the following SCSI
error:
Apr 23 18:31:41 localhost kernel: Directory sread (sector 0x1a0) failed
Apr 23 18:31:41 localhost kernel: SCSI disk error : host 1 channel 0 id 6 lun 0 return code = 27010000
Apr 23 18:31:41 localhost kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:04, sector 416
I get several dozens or hundreds of them very fast. Then the drive is not
usable anymore and in a strange state (can't umount and similar).
This is with 2.2.6-ac1 and 2.2.5.
It is probably only visible in connection with SCSI emulation for IDE
devices, which I need for the CD Recorder.
