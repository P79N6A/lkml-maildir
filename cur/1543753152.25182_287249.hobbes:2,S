Damn that sucks.  I think stable releases need every patch audited
before they get Linus' blessing, and unfortunately it seems we don't
have the required 150+ people jumping up to volunteer.  :(
Yes I have unrealistic goals.  Sane, but unrealistic.  Perhaps
collaboration with the major distributions to volunteer developers to do
the auditing?  We need SOMETHING; there's been too much line noise here
about kernel security holes.  Whether this is new or people are just
noticing and overreacting now, it's still not good.
Unfortunately, "Something" requires manpower.  Manpower requires people
who aren't busy doing other things, like improving preemptiveness,
rewriting the VM system, enhancing the scheduler, or writing new
drivers.  And unfortunately, not only is everyone busy with all of that;
but we NEED all of that too.
Well, maybe you can't start up a group now, or implement audit policy;
but perhaps the invitation needs to be there.  I see there are no -audit
or -security lists on vger; perhaps somebody should start a
linux-kernel-audit@vger list just to get the ball rolling.  If it grows
big enough, then you can consider some policy about having the changes
audited FIRST before releasing; for now that's just not feasible.
