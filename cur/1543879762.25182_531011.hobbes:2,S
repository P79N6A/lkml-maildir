I don't know if you have seen my mail from yesterday evening (here). I
found that changing keventd prio fixed the problem. You may be interested
in the description. I sent it at 21:01 (+200).

Fine, I'll have a look. I already had to rediff the sched-fair-fork
patch last time.

Nice.

I discovered I had the frame-buffer enabled (I did not notice it first
because I do not have the logo and the resolution is the same as text).
It's matroxfb with a G400, if that can help. It may be possible that
it needs some CPU that it cannot get to clear the display before
switching, I don't know.
However I won't try this right now, I'm deep in userland at the moment.

Willy
