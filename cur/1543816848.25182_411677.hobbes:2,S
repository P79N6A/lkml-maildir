That's pretty hard unfortunately. There are plenty of operations
that just access the page cache directly for IO 
(like sendfile or mmap or other IO) 
And allocating bounce buffers is tricky because the IO paths
cannot allocate memory reliably without deadlocks (or rather 
it would require mempool and other inefficient measures)
Doing forced COW like ptrace is probably more practical.
