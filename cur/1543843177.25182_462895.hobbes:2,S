It is divided already in two layers:
ks0108.c -> It is the driver for a LCD controller. It deals with the
hardware (not directly, it uses parport module). It exports the
functions defined for such controller to other modules.
cfag12864b.c -> It is a LCD driver, depends on ks0108. This is the
driver that tells what and how to write.

I don't think so. The ks0108 controller driver was built to control
the LCD using the parallel port and a specific wiring.
If you want to use your boards, write a driver for them. What is the problem.

A generic driver for what? There are many different ports/wirings,
different LCDs displays, different LCD controllers, different
protocols...
I didn't understand what do you mean.
