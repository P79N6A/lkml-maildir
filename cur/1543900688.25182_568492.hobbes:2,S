we shouldn't need a restore code path if the new kernel re-detects 
everything. if kexec already shuts down all the devices we may not need to 
implement anything new here (although there may be room for future 
performance optimization)

for prototyping there's no need to use the same kernel.

what fixes are you thinking of?
you are makeing this sound very simple ;-)
