FWIW $(TOPDIR) is already banished from the latest xfs build code:
http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/xfs-linux/Makefile
and the patch is in -mm too via git:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.24-rc6/2.6.24-rc6-mm1/broken-out/git-xfs.patch
Thanks,

p.s. what is $(objtree) exactly?  I don't see it mentioned in
Documentation/kbuild except as one line in an example... I thought
$(obj) and $(src) should be used outside of the core kbuild
infrastructure, and in this case wouldn't it be $(src) anyway?
