Yes. That is sometimes the case. I have improved things somewhat though.

Yes. autofs v3 is quite a solid product but doesn't understand direct 
mounts. amd is a good product as well. In the end I decided to start work 
on autofs v4 because of the syntax differences to our Sun environment as 
well and the fact that it wasn't being maintained.

And that would be 4.1.0-beta3 you are talking about right?
Perhaps you could tell me about your problems and I'll put them on my 
growing todo list for 4.1.1.

The kernel module is only needed to provide support for browsable 
directories (I coined it 'ghost'ing directories in autofs v4). The 
difficulty is many people don't like, and should not have 
to, patch the kernel to get the full functionality of the daemon.
