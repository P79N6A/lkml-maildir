The thing is, I _really_ think it is broken.
The way to make it fail is to have many large SHARED mappings - in which
case we have backing space for 99% of all memory, and returning -1 just
because a few pages need swap-space and can't be thrown out is wrong.
Try it with no swap, and having some processes that MAP_SHARED much more
than available memory and many (small) processes that do not, and need
swap-space. It should work fine - we're never even _close_ to being out of
memory, but your change makes "swap_out()" fail all the time.
