In the specific case of email; you want to make certain guarantees,
and having data written to non-volatile storage is one of them.
As for power-failures, given enough time and enough hardware you will
get them, even if your machines are dual or triple powered of diverse
UPSs or -48V powered; it still is possible and _will eventually
happen_ that something further down the line like the motherboard will
fry or whatever.
People who assume that a small-window is small enough and decide that
is 'good enough' are dangerous :)
