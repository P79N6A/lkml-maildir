Good.
If I read this code right:

then the code executed if the fork connector is off is a call to an
inline function that tests an integer, finds it zero, and returns.
This is sufficiently little code that I for one would hardly
even need lmbench to be comfortable that fork() wasn't impacted
seriously, in the case that the fork connector is disabled.
