I believe the ATI chipset managed to somehow get the timer interrupt to
arive both on the legacy 8259 and the APIC causing each timer tick to
count twice.  Nice way to double your system time rate.  The nforce2
didn't double, it just ran fast some of the time, which I have no idea
how happened, but it went away with newer kernels (and wasn't there with
earlier kernels either).
