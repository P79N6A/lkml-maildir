Good point -- all I really need for module parameters is the number
of readers.  I should be able to have module load start the test and
module unload stop it (any problems with this approach?).  And doing
a module should remove the intrusions into rcupdate.c and rcupdate.h,
which would be good.
I would rather avoid dmesg.  But perhaps a read-only debugfs for output
(as Greg suggested) combined with module parameters for input could make
this straightforward.

Which would mean that each test needs to give unambiguous machine-readable
indication of failure.  I guess I will nominate the string "!!!".  ;-)

I agree that there is definitely a need for both user-level and in-kernel
testing.  User-level testing is needed to make sure that user programs get
what they need, but there is no substitute for in-kernel testing when you
need to apply maximum conceiveable stress on some kernel component.
