See my previous message from the other day... this would be defined in 
each arch's asm/pci.h, which eliminates this problem you describe.  Each 
arch maintainer would indeed decide how to define it, though over time 
I'm sure it would grow commonly-named struct members.
My main want is cosmetic -- call a spade a spade, so to speak. 
 s/sysdata/pci_domain/  But doing so opens the door to increased 
flexibility.  Later steps can add common members needed by pci-to-pci 
IOMMU tricks which are common to most platforms.
