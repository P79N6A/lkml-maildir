Ooops, you are not Alexander Nyberg :) Sorry, to give my previous reply
more context: I had a conversation with Alexander Nyberg who wanted to
debug this problem this weekend, and I gave detailed instructions on how
to reproduce it (which is a bit awkward). I also wrote a script that
doesn't rely on X running, but triggers the bug much less often (in fact,
only twice for me so far), and then it seems only the first time after
reboot (which *could* be caused by the very different timing of the
stat()-threads due to the extra disk access).
Let's see what Alexander found out (if he found time). The problem does
not happen (or is not reproducible) with newer IO::AIO releases, as that
one doesn't start threads in the child after the fork/before the exec.
