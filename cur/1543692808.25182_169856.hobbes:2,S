OK, a few comments here:
1) the vserver functionality definately is not "future functionality",
   people have been using it in production for a few years already
2) currently vserver only runs on 2.4 (and I think 2.2), it hasn't
   been ported to 2.6 yet and I definately plan to port it in such
   a way that we will be reusing other infrastructure whereever
   possible ... it's just that vserver needs some infrastructure
   that is not possible inside LSM
3) the needs that can be met with existing infrastructure, like
   CLONE_NEWNS or LSM should definately move out of the vserver
   patch in the port to 2.6
4) I'm all for generalising the interface, how about sys_virtual_context ?
