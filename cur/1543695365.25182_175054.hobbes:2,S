Well, that was weird.  I still couldn't see anything wrong this morning, so I 
commented out the line (declaration of sock_alloc_send_skb()), to see 
whether the compile error disappeared or moved on to the next line.  Built a 
little, and the include file didn't give any problems.  Stared at the header 
some more, and nothing seemed to make sense, as there are earlier 
declarations which start exactly the same.  So I used "undo" in Emacs to get 
the file back _exactly_ how it was in the first place, and saved it.
Then I did a "make clean" and "make" again, and it worked fine.  This was the 
point I started doubting my own sanity.  Especially after I'd checked the 
diff and saw that nothing in the area had been changed by the move from 8 to 
9.
I guess we can forget about that one.  Cosmic ray?
