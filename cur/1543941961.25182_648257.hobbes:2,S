The iSCSI CDBs and write immediate, unsoliciated, or soliciated data
payloads may be received out of order across communication paths (which
may be going over different subnets) within the nexus, but the execution
of the CDB to SCSI Target Port must be in the same order as it came down
from the SCSI subsystem on the initiator port.  In iSCSI and iSER terms,
this is called Command Sequence Number (CmdSN) ordering, and is enforced
within each nexus.  The initiator node will be assigning the CmdSNs as
the CDBs come down, and when communication paths fail, unacknowledged
CmdSNs will be retried on a different communication path when using
iSCSI/iSER connection recovery.  Already acknowledged CmdSNs will be
explictly retried using a iSCSI specific task management function called
TASK_REASSIGN.  This along with CSM-I and CSM-E statemachines are
collectly known as ErrorRecoveryLevel=2 in iSCSI.
Anyways, here is a great visual of a modern iSCSI Target processor and
SCSI Target Engine.  The CmdSN ordering is representd by the oval across
across iSCSI connections going to various network portals groups on the
left side of the diagram.  Thanks Eddy Q!
