Hello Daniel,
> Look at the program headers.  Many of them probably have a file size of
I checked the PHDRS (readelf --segments) the following are the PHDRS
of the core.exe
===============<BEGIN>==================
Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0x8048364
There are 11 program headers, starting at offset 52
Program Headers:

o As you said I see some of the PHDRS are having FileSiz as zero, the
first (1st **ed ) PHDR which is having virtual address 0x08048000
(this is obviously) the start of the text of the program, and its not
having any memory in the core file.
o Does the other PHDRS for which FileSiz is zero correspond to the
dynamic shared objects (.so) text ?? example in the above we see (2
**ed ) PHDR with VirtAddr as 0xf649c000 , so this means the text of
some shared .so has been mapped here right?
o I have question about the memory mapping with permissions r--s or
r--p (gconv used by glibc gets mapped like this some time) , so does
the core file contains this information of the memory mappings?
o Is there a way I can findout the standard which the OS follows to
write the core file?
o Rather than depending on the OS core file, hows your opinion on
writing out all the mappings form /proc/<pid>/maps as PT_LOAD into a
elf formatted file of type ET_EXEC, do you think this works? rather
than converting core file to exe?

Yes I can reproduce this , is there a bugzilla for kernel? (or should
we report this at the buzilla of the distribution?)
Thank you,
