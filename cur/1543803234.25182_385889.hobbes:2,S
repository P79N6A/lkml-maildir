Unfortunately, as I previously explained, I'm not able to test this.
The reason is that in order to reproduce the bug, you need a system
with a VIVT write-back write-allocate cache.
Unfortunately, the few systems I have which have such a cache do not
have IDE, SCSI nor SATA (not even PCMCIA.)  I suggest contacting the
folk who reported the bug in the first instance.
