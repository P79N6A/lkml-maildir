Then it should be kept.
The watchdog API simply pre-dates the sysfs world, it goes back to the
1.0-1.2 era and has remained very consistent since that time.
If you expose it in sysfs somewhere (which I think is a good idea) then
the units should probably also be fixed in the sysfs case to be metric
(ie Kelvin or Centigrade float values) [or scaled int]

Pass the usual time structures instead. Seconds is a field so it is free
but it means all the signed/unsigned stuff and any future subsecond
watchdogs for embedded environments don't break stuff.

Can this not use the power management callbacks from the device model
instead

This wants breaking out into sysfs, but again the ioctls are expected
and standardised for years now.
People have talked about sorting out a watchdog helper library for years
so this is overdue, and doing it with the class model in mind is even
better.
