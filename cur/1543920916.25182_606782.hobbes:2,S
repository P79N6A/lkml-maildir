Will check in a few minutes, after my current test:  I noticed that 
sg_tablesize in sata_mv is not LIBATA_MAX_PRD.  This is expected 
behavior, but I wonder if that difference -- most notably being smaller 
than SCSI_MAX_SG_SEGMENTS -- would trigger any latent bugs.
Anyway, we will both have answers momentarily...
