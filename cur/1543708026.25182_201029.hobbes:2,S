Yes, we'll have to fall back to plan A and use the map_context pointer
to hold the path being used (attached patch for illustration only).  I
had been hoping we could keep the map_context unused so that we could
allow the path selectors to use it.  I should have spotted this.
I'll also move the failed bio remap back to mpath_end_io(), so that
the context can be reused there (it moved to the daemon when we were
trying to do path testing in the kernel).
