It's impressive how slow the machine is with the cache turned off, it
took 3/4 minutes between init and the login prompt (compared to the
previous 10/20 sec)...
movopt2.cpp works fine with the cache turned off while it fails with the
cache turned on. But there's to say that the timing could be different
with the cache turned on. Usually it hangs at 300 here and with UC at 500
was still fine (it took a long time to reach 500).
If somebody want to play with the cache turned off I enclose here the
patch I did:
