More realistically:
	maxsize = get_process_count() + 100;
	buffer = (ps_rec **) malloc(sizeof(ps_rec * maxsize);
	size = get_process_data(buffer);
	zombies = 0;
	for (i=0; i<size; i++)
	    if (buffer[i].state == ZOMBIE)
		zombies++;
No matter how large you make the buffer, if it's not geared to
the current number of processes, it's ripe for a buffer over-run
attack...

Am I right in thinking that once a process achieves Zombie
status, it tays as an unschedulable zombie until killed?
If so, then an obvious solution would be to move zombies out of
the process table into a separate linked list (or perhaps into
the /proc/nzombies file) and thus free up the process slots they
used to occupy.
That would probably produce a kernel speedup as well, as the
kernel wouldn't need to scan through the zombies checking they
are zombies when it schedules...
Best wishes from Riley.
