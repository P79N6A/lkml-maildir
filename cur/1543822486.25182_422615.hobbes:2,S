Don't.  Fix.  Correct.  Code.
Ever.  Because sooner or later you will paper over real bug.  It's far better
to reject patches that just make $TOOL to STFU than risk blind "fix" hiding
a real bug.
Unless you show a real codepath that leads to use without initialization
(and do that in commit message, so it could be verified as real issue),
these patches are worthless in the best case and dangerous in the worst
one.
