Why is that a weakness? If the compiler's optimizer says "this code runs
faster when not inlined" (I can think of a couple of reasons why it would
even be right doing that...), I'm not qualified to contradict it.

"extern inline" is defined by ISO C 9x (AFAIR) to behave exactly like it
does with current EGCS snapshots, i.e. either somebody needs to define a
non-inlined version somewhere OR the thing needs to be "static inline".
I don't think the EGCS people are going to like a new "force inlining"
keyword. I could be wrong, though...
Therefore, I can think of four possible solutions (though I don't really
like the first one ;-) :
1- Annoy the EGCS people until they revert to the previous behavior
1- Annoy the EGCS people until they implement __attribute__((always_inline))
   (or implement it yourself)
2- s/extern inline/static inline
3- enclose all the "extern inline"s in
#ifndef DO_EXTERN_FOO
extern inline
#endif
int foo(bar) {
	baz
}
so that the kernel Makefiles can compile the functions by doing a
#define DO_EXTERN_FOO
#include "linux/file_with_foo.h"
for each affected FOO, and then link with an archive of these, comparable
to the way libgcc.a is built.
Obviously, the last two are not mutually exclusive.
