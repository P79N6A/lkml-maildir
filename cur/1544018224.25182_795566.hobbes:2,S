Subject: [PATCH] Fix longstanding "error: storage size of '__mod_dmi_device_table' isn't known"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/21/324

gcc 3.4.6 doesn't like MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(dmi, x) expansion enough to error out.
Shut it up in a most simple way.
