   Do you really need to do this ? 
                   if (unlikely(!spin_trylock(&pagecache_lock))) {
                           /* we hold the page lock so the page cannot go away from under us */
                           spin_unlock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
   
                           spin_lock(&pagecache_lock);
                           spin_lock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
                   }
   
   Have you actually seen bad hold times of pagecache_lock by
   shrink_caches() ? 
Marcelo, this is needed because of the spin lock ordering rules.
The pagecache_lock must be obtained before the pagemap_lru_lock
or else deadlock is possible.  The spin_trylock is an optimization.
Franks a lot,
