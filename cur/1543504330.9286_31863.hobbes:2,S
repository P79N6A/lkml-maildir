Really?  So I should give higher priority to preserving the existing
pages owned by a runaway memory eater, and starve the new login process
that root is trying to create to kill that runaway?  And we should
ignore the needs of networking --- if we're using all the existing pages
then we shouldn't try to free some up to allow networking to continue?
That just doesn't work, I'm afraid --- prioritising exisiting pages will
just make memory hogs worse.
