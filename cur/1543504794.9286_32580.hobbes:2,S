ksymoops expects Call Trace fileds to be enclosed in <[...]>.  Make
those fields look like this or ksymoops ignores them.
Call Trace: <[c0117cf9]> <[c01180e5]> <[c0107f8e]>

EIP has to come before Code to define where the failing instruction is.
In fact the presence of the Code line tells ksymoops it is the end of
the oops so it can pull everything together and decode the report.  The
Code line must be last.
