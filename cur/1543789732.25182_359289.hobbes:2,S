*blush*, applied.
I was already wondering a bit why that check never triggered for anyone.  
It is easy to have a non-monotonic clock (there's lots of crappy hw and 
the gettimeofday code has to work hard) and the effects of time warps 
are subtle, if noticeable at all, so i expected some detections.
i have released -rt13 with another change: the other timer warning is 
only printed once. (a steady stream of messages is not helpful)
