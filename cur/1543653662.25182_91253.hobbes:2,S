Aaaah, I see where you're coming from.
I basically tried to stay away from knowing _what_ actual
type it is and just to make it signed and do the arithmetic,
but didn't know the specific for the Alpha.
Shouldn't this be (symbolically:) (signed (typeof(jiffes)) jiffies -
(signed (typeof(start)) start -- you know what I mean.
But yes both ways should work:
a, b are both unsigned, then a-b = a+(-b) and there's just no
other way to compute the result.
Anyway, doesn't matter,
