OK, thanks.
Klaus, Jan: could you please see if your problem with 2.6.22 goes away 
with noacpi passed as a flag to libata?
Jeff: I will add the noacpi test suggestion into the Debian bug report 
here 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=428975
 to try to 
ensure that Klaus sees it.
Cheers,
 	Bruce
