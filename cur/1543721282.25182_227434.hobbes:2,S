If you make a kernel thread, it can sleep forever if it wants, you
can wake it up with wake_up_interruptible() from an interrupt after
you have laid out the work you want it to do. That kernel thread
has access to all your kernel data space, plus can spin-lock to
prevent an interrupt from changing things in critical sections,
etc.
It's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
