Thanks for your help.
I thought I tried this before I posted, and I just tried it again to verify.
With my previous .config and CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS=yes, 
aboot-0.5 hangs with a last message of 
  aboot: ok, now starting the kernel ...
This led me to believe that the documented behavior for 
CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS was broken in test5-pre3, I left it unset
since my aboot could start the resulting kernel.
