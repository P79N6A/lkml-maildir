I have an old Leadtek Winfast something or other (8MB Permedia 2).  I
see hangs on idle (saw someone point that to a conflict in 2.4.10 in apm
and the IO-APIC or something like that), shut down (when X exits) or on
console switch.  These do not happen all the time, but they are there.
Just another data point.
RedHat 7.1 up-to-date with Ximian's Gnome.
