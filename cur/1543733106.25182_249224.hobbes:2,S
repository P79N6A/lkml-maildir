If you make your changelog look like (no '-'es):
-------------------------------------------------------------------
drm: remove DRIVER_FILE_FIELDS
<empty line>
remove DRIVER_FILE_FIELDS, replace with a private driver structure
allocated in open helper and freed in free_filp_priv.

Then it will look nice in the short changelog Linus post for each
-rc, final release.
And the drm: tag is a way to tell non-insiders that this patch
changes drm.
