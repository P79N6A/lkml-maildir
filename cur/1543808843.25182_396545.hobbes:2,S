Most people don't see a problem to fix.   Your arguments have been roundly
refuted.   On top of which, cdrecord works on Linux just fine already when
you pass the device node on the command line.   There just isn't much 
motivation to pursue a fix for some theoretical problem that doesn't affect
real users in practice.  Since you are the only one who sees this as a huge
problem you should invest in providing a patch that can be reviewed for 
inclusion.
