> It most certainly does not. gcc will assume that an int* has int alignment. memcpy() is a builtin, which gcc can translate to pretty much anything. And C specifies that a pointer to foo, will point to a real object of type foo, so gcc can't be blamed for the unsafe typecasts. I have tested this the hard way, so this is not just speculation.
Yes, on *int and other assumed aligned pointers, gcc uses its internal
version.
However, my point is that those pointers, unless speaking of packed
structures, can safely be assumed aligned, while char*/void* can't.

Nothing does, even memcpy doesn't check alignment of the source, or
alignment at all in some assembly implementations (only word-copy,
without checking if at word-boundary).
