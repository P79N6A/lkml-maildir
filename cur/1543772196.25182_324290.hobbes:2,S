this one should be fixed in the latest patch. (note that when 
DEBUG_RT_LOCKING_MODE is set the spinlocks/rwlocks default to 
non-preemptible. You can set preemption it via 
/proc/sys/kernel/preempt_locks. You normally dont want to enable this 
option.)

could you try the latest (-48-03) patch? I fixed a couple of things that 
might impact SMP booting.

a freeze is always a problem, whether it can be worked around via a 
CONFIG parameter or not. Generally if you see any reduction in 
functionality that deviates from the stock Linux kernel, it's a bug.
