Yeah, I'll be trying to (lack of cgroup fu for the moment).
I think something like
 /cgroup
 /cgroup/system
 /cgroup/system/boot
 /cgroup/big_honking_app
 /cgroup/rt_domain
Where the system group includes all IRQs and all unbound kernel threads
(by default). The system/boot group will contain all of userspace.
Doing it in this way ought to allow for some weird setups. The system
group can overlap with anything that does need system services. The boot
group must be a subset thereof, and can be shrunk to a small part of the
machine.
