Thanks, patch applied to linuxtv.org CVS.
BTW, like I said in some previous mail I think this "Big DVB update"
isn't ready for prime time yet. It breaks support for some
DVB cards (partially fixed in linuxtv.org CVS), so I think
this should not go into the mainline kernel now. IMHO it's better
to wait until 2.6.10 is out.
Michael: Do you think differently?
