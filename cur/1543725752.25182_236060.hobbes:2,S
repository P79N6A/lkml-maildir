sysfs only takes care about the bus hierarchy as far as suspend/resume
is concerned (which is the only sane way to do it imho)

No, the ordering cannot be dictated by the upper layer, but by the
physical bus hierarchy. The low level driver gets the suspend callback
and need to notify the parent. The md/multipath must keep track that one
of the device it relies on is going away and thus block the queues.
That is at least for machine suspend/resume.

Yes, but the PM herarchy is the bus hierarchy, I don't see a simple way
of going through both in this case ...
