This is because the mouse refresh rate is around 160-200 with my input
patches as opposed to the standard 100 without them. This would not
be faster by itself, but I think it changes the behavior of the acceleration
routines.
If you wonder what a refresh rate for mouse higher than the screen refresh
rate is good for, when you can't see the mouse updating faster than the
second one nevertheless, then try drawing something in GIMP, and see that
with the higher refresh rate the curves are much more round and precise.
Obvious.

It has something with the raw mode emulation my patches have to do
(because X only understands raw mode, and the keyboard no longer
talks the same raw mode as it used to with my patches, which is
good anyway). The emulation is perfect on a 102-key keyboard, but
it differs a little with the extra keys. I'll try to fix it at least
for the gui and menu keys in the next release.

Could you send me the patches you did? I still use libc5 and that
doesn't give me any trouble.
