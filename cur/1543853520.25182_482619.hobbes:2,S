Why?
I could possibly pass the pathname as text, except that (a) the path length
may exceed PAGE_SIZE and MAXPATHLEN, and (b) doing a full path lookup() is a
complete waste of time as the daemon already has the directory open on a file
descriptor, and so effectively has a bookmark to the location that I can use,
if I can but get hold of it.
