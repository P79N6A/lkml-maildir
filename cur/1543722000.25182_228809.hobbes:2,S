No. That breaks stuff. Only sane solution IMO is to leave the
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build symlink alone, and add another
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/object symlink that points to the object tree.

Separate source and object tree feature has been in mainline for at least
half a year. Linus has released 8 stable kernels in the 2.6 line of kernels.
Distros have released uncounted number of kernels based on those 2.6
kernels. All of those kernels, except latest SUSE damaged ones, have the
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build symlink pointing to source tree if they are
compiled to use separate object tree.
My point is that this separate source and object trees thingy is not
anything new, even though some SUSE people seem to think so. If SUSE people
choose to break their kernels, it is their problem and their customers'
problem. I don't see any reason why mainline should be broken just because
SUSE people chose break their kernels.
