Damn.  I was looking at the 2.3.51 source.  The pleasures of fiddling
with a kernel which is on the other end of a dialup connection.
I see now that if the CPU has a timestamp counter the loops_per_sec is
in fact cpu cycles per sec and is hence higher.
Is this a plot to make people think 2.4 is faster?
