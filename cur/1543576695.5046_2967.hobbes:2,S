That's not necessarily true.  There is work in linux to support Tri-stating
the ide devices with the help of a custom card that will allow one to cut
power to a specific ide device. Tri-stating allows Hot Swapping of ide
devices now.  I even had a picture of the device the person is using to hot
swap.  I'm sorry that I have forgotten this kernel hackers name as i have
lost the original email Along with said picture. I'm pretty sure the person
who gave it to me was 2.4.x's IDE guy but I cant be sure right now.
