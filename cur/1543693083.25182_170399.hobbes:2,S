Subject: 2.6.0_test6: CONFIG_I8K produces wrong/no keycodes for special buttons

There are 4 special buttons on dell-laptops which you could only get to 
work using CONFIG_I8K. This worked well in any 2.4-kernel, by pressing 
these buttons the keycodes 129. 130, 131, 132 get produced. In 
2.6.0-test6_mm2 it produces <nothing>, 162, <nothing>, 110. I've digged 
into the code without any succes for now. Any hints?
Thx,
Jan
PS: Beside that i've also problems to get some of my pcmcia-cards runnig 
(ISDN and WLAN). May someone point me to any URL getting more 
information concerning the new ISDN-TTY-Interface in kernel-2.6?
