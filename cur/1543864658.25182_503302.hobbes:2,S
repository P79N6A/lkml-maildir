Don't get confused by the fact that the majority of the NetBSD platforms
are sub-architectures.  I'm talking about 25 unique CPU architectures.
Or is it 20.  I haven't looked in a while, the tree is there for anyone
else to look at :)
And even then, I think just the pure number of variants of ARM and PPC
that we support is greater than NetBSD's sub-arch support too...
