Every discontigmem arch should implement cpu_to_node, with a generic
fallback mechanism that returns 0 or something. Not that we do right
now, but that's easy to fix. There should also be a node_to_cpus call
that returns a bitmask of which cpus are in that node.
Matt ... want to sneak in the first bit of the topology patch, or
whatever lump this fell under? Seems like an appropriate juncture.
We have the code already somewhere, just need to fish it out.

I don't think the userspace stuff is necessary - we can do this all 
in the kernel dead easily I think. Just need a couple of definitions,
which are trivially small functions.
