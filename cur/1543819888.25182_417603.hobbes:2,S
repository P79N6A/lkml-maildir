It offers nothing that isn't available elsewhere (I think), except more
cheaply. It also has the potential to be multiplatform one day. Right now to
get the CPU usage of a random pid, one has to implement the equivalent of
/proc/ parsing for each platform.
If at least Linux did 'getrusage for foreign pid', that would clean up
things up somewhat already.
It might even mean a 'portable top', and who knows, more unixes might
follow.
I for one would save work having a getrusage that does this.
