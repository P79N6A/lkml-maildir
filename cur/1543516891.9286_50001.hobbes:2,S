If your task doesn't sleep it won't be pre-empted. However on an SMP box
they might run in parallel one day.
You can either use spinlocks or semaphores. spinlocks can only be held for
short durations (ideally anyway) but have very very low overhead. A semaphore
can be held without impacting overall system efficiency.
In your case I'd probably use a spin lock like so
	spinlock_t ioaccess_lock;
	get_user(...)
	spin_lock(&ioaccess_lock);
	outb(foo)
	outb(bar)
	spin_unlock(&ioaccess_lock);
init:
	spin_lock_init(&io_access_lock);
See the 2.3.x radio drivers for some fairly simple examples
