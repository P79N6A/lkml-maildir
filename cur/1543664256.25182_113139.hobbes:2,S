I've faced with a similar problem and my attempt to get any help from any guru
here failed (you can try to find my post called "Q: problems interfacing with
tty ldisc using flipbufs" posted 02 Dec 2002 that describes the problem). It
seems that your post won't have any response either :-(

Not only hard-coded, but also are private for n_tty.c, so a tty driver has no
way to find out what are the values :-( It would be fine if there were a way
to send data to the n_tty line discipline without knowledge of the values, but
unfortunately it seems that it's impossible using current interface to line
disciplines.

1. I don't think that adding n_tty--specific field(s) to the tty structure is
   a good idea.
2. I think that the interface between tty drivers and line disciplines is
   broken in the sense that it fails to provide reliable method of data
   transfer between tty driver and line discipline. I believe that either the
   interface should be re-designed (that may involve quite large amount of
   work as it will affect line disciplines other than n_tty), or a work-around
   local to n_tty.c should be implemented. As what you suggest is neither of
   the above two solutions (as adding the fields to the tty structure won't
   fix the interface), I don't think it's a correct way to fix the problem.
My own solution to this problem is to make TTY_THRESHOLD_THROTTLE to be at
least as large as TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE. It will guarantee that driver's throttle
routine will be called without data loss. I have no idea though which
unfortunate side effects this change may have.
