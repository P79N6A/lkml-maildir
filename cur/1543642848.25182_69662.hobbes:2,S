  You haven't read your RFCs.  They demand no such thing!
  Recently the compilations of RFC 2821 and 2822 were done because there
  are about a dozen RFCs full of obscure details, and even errors.
  RFC 1123 (Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support)
  does say that the SMTP CLIENT (e.g. sending SMTP system) must support
  and use MXes.    RFC 974 says HOW:
  RFC 974 around page 4:  (Mail Routing and the Domain System)
Interpreting the List of MX RRs
  ....
   It is possible that the list of MXs in the response to the query will
   be empty.  This is a special case.  If the list is empty, mailers
   should treat it as if it contained one RR, an MX RR with a preference
   value of 0, and a host name of REMOTE.  (I.e., REMOTE is its only
   MX).  In addition, the mailer should do no further processing on the
   list, but should attempt to deliver the message to REMOTE.  The idea
   here is that if a domain fails to advertise any information about a
   particular name we will give it the benefit of the doubt and attempt
   delivery.
