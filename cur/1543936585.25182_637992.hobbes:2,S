Even 1-2MB overhead would be too much for distributors I think. Ideally
there must be near zero overhead for possible CPUs (and I see no principle
reason why this is not possible) Worst case a low few hundred KBs, but even
that would be much.
There are the cpusets which get passed around, but these are only one bit per 
possible CPU.
