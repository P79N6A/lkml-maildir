What's the benefit of such an interface? If you're able to trigger
keyboard LEDs via that interface, you're also able to use the ioctl()
on /dev/console.
I think the intention of the blink driver was to have a *early* blink,
i.e. before initrd (and on systems without intrd, before the first
init script runs).
