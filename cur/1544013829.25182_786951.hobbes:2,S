Really minor nit, just noticed...

I can't parse the comment above, and imho it is confusing and
misleading. We can dereference pid namespace even in interrupt
context.
Also, the comment looks as if "when siginfo_from_user() is false,
it is not safe/possible to derive from_ancestor_ns". This is not
true, in that case we know that from_ancestor_ns must be false.
from_ancestor_ns == T means the signal was sent from the user
space, and it was sent to the task in the sub-namespace, so it
is clear why we check siginfo_from_user().
