So is this just to allow for waking up of the IRQ threads?  I can see an
improvement on SMP since it would allow for the IRQ thread to run on
another CPU while the current CPU has local_irq_disable.  Or is this
just to improve the SA_NODELAY?

I don't understand this paragraph at all :-?    Where is the PI with the
local_irq_disable?   So what if the IRQs can happen anytime?  Maybe it's
just because it's late and I've spent the last three hours catching up
on this and other threads (I still need to read the "Attempted
summary ..." thread. Wow that's big!), but this paragraph just totally
lost me.

I hope you at least respond to me ;-) but I might try to implement that
per CPU BKL for local_irq_... just to see how it looks. But then again
you have to check all the code that uses it to see if it's not just
protection some local CPU data. Since there's not too many reasons to
use local_irq_.. in an SMP environment.  So when they are used, it
probably would be for a reason that a global mutex wouldn't work for. Oh
well, I guess I don't need to implement that after all. 
Cheers,
