Hi,
what's with the 'type' argument of the access_ok() macro. As long as my kernel 
source browsing system lxr doesn't show something wrong, I'm pretty much sure 
that the type argument in access_ok() is not being used in any arch. Is this 
on purpose or has it become obsolete but nobody dared to break things by 
removing it? ... or probably it is some kernel magic :)?
Regards,
Boris.
