Subject: How to stress test?  (and 2.0.x SMP yucks)

Hi,
I have a spanking new machine destined to be a high-volume production mail
server.  I want to try and stress-test it to see what will break (if
anything) - I'd like to detect as many problems as possible before we put it
in the computer room.  I'm looking for typical things like 
memory/controller/problems which surface quickly.
The machine's specs are:
	Dual PII/350
	128MB 100Mhz RAM
	3c590 network adapter
	2x AHA2970
	4x IBM scsi (4GB), destined to be a raid5'ed /var/ partition.
	Small IDE disk for the root (should be 95% read-only).
I'll be using kernel 2.0.36 to begin with, anxiously anticipating the
release of 2.2.0.  :-)
My question is, what methods do people use to stress test sw/hw
combinations?
I've currently got the machine in lots of tight loops making TCP connections
to itself constantly, and compiling the kernel willy-nilly, but I was
wondering if any of you had any better ideas for me.
Also, are there any obvious problems with this hardware configuration?
Btw, I think I came up with a pretty clear-cut demonstration of why 2.0.x
SMP isn't good enough:
	dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024k count=24 | gzip -c |zcat >/dev/null
locks the machine up reeeal tight for 1-2 seconds, with incredibly delayed
(or missing) responses from the console itself (just switching VTs could
take 2-3 seconds).  This is actually bad enough to be a primitive denial of
service attack..
This same command didn't have any noticable effect on my trusty old
single-processor 5x86/160 here at home, so it appears that enabling SMP can
in some cases cause a performance hit instead of a gain.  (I suppose this is
probably old news, but I thought I'd see if any interesting discussions
would result from my experience.. ;)
Thanks in advance, and happy holidays!
