"You need to address the potential security issue as it relates to the
kernel stack first, then 'prove it to me'".
Yes there, there was a potenial dangerous exploit if careless.
I believe that it is gone.
Understand that the vendor is required to have minimal exposure on the
IO base and discrete lowlevel points.  Yet offer them the legal protection
of their IP under a LGPL.
EVERYONE Stop on the second guessing.......this does not allow or propose
the linking of libraries to the compiled kernel, it is more difficult than
that silly nasty.
