One more bit of data.  XFree86 reports that my system has a:
    (--) PCI:*(1:0:0) ATI Rage 128 Mobility MF rev 0, Mem @ 0xe8000000/26, 0xfcffc000/14, I/O @ 0xcc00/8
A few friends of mine have similar Dell laptops with the same set of kernel
modules loaded -- and theirs do not choke on APM suspend.  But their systems 
report a slightly different r128 model: 
    (--) PCI:*(1:0:0) ATI Rage 128 Mobility LF rev 2, Mem @ 0xf8000000/26, 0xf4100000/14, I/O @ 0x2000/8
