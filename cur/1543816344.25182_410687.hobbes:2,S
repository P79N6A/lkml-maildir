Yes, I'll do that.

That's true.  What I'm not so clear on is why you care that we have a
similar facility in userland.  The userland SMA is so simple, we haven't
had to touch it in a long time, except to use the new ioctl-free ABI.
There's negligible duplicated coding effort going on.

I'll have to chew over this for a bit with a few other people.  I'm not
actually trying to be difficult; it's just that changing the SMA at this
point is quite disruptive.  we have schedules to muck with, plans to
accelerate, people to reallocate, and the like.
It would be a huge relief to me to be able to simply merge what we have
with the understanding that we'll resolve the SMA issue to your liking
as soon as possible, but you're the gatekeeper.

Very much.

I hope you're right.
