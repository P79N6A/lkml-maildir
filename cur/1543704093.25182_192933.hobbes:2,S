oh hello,
it is back, the woes with the blackslash & bar key on my japanese 106
PS/2 keyboard. thought I knew how to ship around until 2.6.1 come out
[until then it was setkeycodes 0x6a 124], but now it doesn't work
anymore. I have absolutly no idea why or how to fix that. I even can't
remember how I found the old keycode, I think it was pure luck.
anyway, I just want to get this off my heart *sigh*
[no | is no good in a shell world]
