Well, there are several things:
 1) Cursor hangs on system load with internal mousepad
    (no external mouse connected)
 2) Cursor jumps a bit with internal mousepad
    (no external mouse connected)
 3) Cursor jumps like crazy when moving external mouse
 4) Cursor randomly clicks when moving external mouse
 5) Hitting the mouse pad does not do a button1-click
 6) Sometimes the keyboard does not work anymore or 
    sends neverending random events - even with no
    external mouse/keyboard
I did not recognize that the previous patch helped in any of these problems, 
but No. 2 is the hardest to check, because I have to work for a while until 
it occurs.
The second patch does not help either.
The i8042.nodemux option only "resolved" No. 3 and No. 4, because the external 
mouse was no more available. Until now, nothing makes anything better.

Possible.

Do you mean hard disk DMA? Then Yes for DMA and yes for polling.

I'll try if I can find out what you mean...
...ok, did the change.
As far as I understand, it has only effect on internal touchpad. I will 
therefore need some time for long time check. You'll hear from me later, but 
this surely won't resolve problems No. 2 - 6.
It is now together with your second patch, you first patch is no more in my 
sources. Is this good? (I understand that by "Vanilla" you mean the original 
source without your first patch?)
