Hello!
I have a machine with only 4MB of RAM. I'm using kernel 2.2.19.
System starts up just fine, and I can load pcmcia-cs. Now, when I insert
pcmcia-card, the card is detected, and the loading of driver is started.
This is where the problems start. Driver says it cannot allocate memory
for the firmware of the card. When I look at the code, it is like this:
ptr = dmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
is there any way to reserve some memory for the driver-module?
Thank you for your help.
