Do you mean, that follow_mount() should never descend into the
dir-on-file mount but that should always be done by
__link_path_walk()?
This could make sense.
__lookup_mnt() currently returns the first matching mount in the hash
list.  With your suggestion, we'd need two __lookup_mnt() variants (or
a parameter).  One, that only matches normal mounts, and one that only
matches dir-on-file mounts.  Is that it?
