This code has been extensively redone in -mm and I am planning on sending
all that to Linus within a week.
The hrtimer rework in -mm might fix this performance problem, although from
a quick peek, perhaps not.
So could you please verify that the problem still needs fixing in
2.6.16-mm1 and if so, raise a patch against that?
Thanks.
