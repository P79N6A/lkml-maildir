...just like it did a few kernels ago (the current->mm issue in 2.5.19
  that eventually got fixed in 2.5.30 or thereabouts, introduced for the
  bk-enabled by cset 1.373.221.1).
I'll go building a 2.5.44 kernel (think it's the only one I didn't have
  too much trouble building / booting in the 2.5.4x series before .47)
  and see whether it works or not.
Later,
