How about a simple solution which would get an array on line and still 
be safe? All it would take is a flag which forced reconstruct writes for 
RAID-5. You could set it with an option, or automatically if someone 
puts --assume-clean with --create, leave it in the superblock until the 
first "repair" runs to completion. And for repair you could make some 
assumptions about bad parity not being caused by error but just unwritten.
Thought 2: I think the unwritten bit is easier than you think, you only 
need it on parity blocks for RAID5, not on data blocks. When a write is 
done, if the bit is set do a reconstruct, write the parity block, and 
clear the bit. Keeping a bit per data block is madness, and appears to 
be unnecessary as well.

Well, I gave you two thoughts, one which would be slow until a repair 
but sounds easy to do, and one which is slightly harder but works better 
and minimizes performance impact.
