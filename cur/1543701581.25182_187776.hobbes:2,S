%Lu expects an unsigned long long argument and nothing else, so we should
cast this sector_t to unsigned long long, not u64.
With u64 this code will generate a warning on ppc64 (at least), because
ppc64's u64 is unsigned long.

hum, OK, I'll tkae a look at that, thanks.

Can you please place the control script inside laptop-mode.txt rather than
in scripts/?  The scripts directory is for kernel build tools, not for
kernel runtime support things.
Thanks.
