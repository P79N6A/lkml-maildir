Yea, _you_ can't imagine this. :) But Kernel developers can... .

I don't think so.
Every new device needs a unique number, that _no other_ device uses.
As more and more devices are developed, we are running out of device
numbers. (well, that may take a while with 32-bit device numbers,
but it may appear so).

(Hm, I'm not Greg, but...)
Because it's cool. :)
No, you're right.
I am not going to use udev or devfs on my server
for example. The reason is quite simple. This server will be running
linux-2.4 until it dies and I will never add some more device to it.
So there is no point of using udev or devfs on it. I know the hardware,
create all nodes for it and it runs (without all the problems devfs
and udev still provide).
But on my main Computer I am going to use udev, because I love it's
flexibility.
_You_ have to decide if you need udev or don't. Nobody else can decide
it for you.
