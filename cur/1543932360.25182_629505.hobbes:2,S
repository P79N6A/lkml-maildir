Hi Ingo,
I included the same patches into 2.6.23.9-rt13 and someone reported s2r 
failed for them. I've included Greg's updates into a pre release of 
-rt14 and sent that to the reporter. I'm waiting on a response before 
releasing -rt14.
Although I did just get a response from Andrew Morton saying that the 
updated patch fixed his box.
