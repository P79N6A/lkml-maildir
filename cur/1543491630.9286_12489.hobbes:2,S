Recently, I had a contractor of mine install a five Intel boxes (PII-400s and
PII-450s) in a provider in San Jose. Although all the pieces in all the
machines were identical, two started producing the following oops under what
appeared to be moderate to heavy disk usage:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000b
current->tss.cr3 = 012c7000, pr3 = 012c7000
*pde = 00000000

A numer of oopses would happen in rapid succession, followed by segfaults of
whatever happened to be running and 'cannot fork()' messages streaming down
the screen locally (I never saw them though... I'm in vancouver, so I can't 
detail exactly what was on the screen if it wasn't logged).
Curiously, the machine also exhibited the following during boot up (Which was
annoying, because the 'timeouts' involved were fairly long):
hda: no response (status = 0xa1), resetting drive
hda: no response (status = 0xa1)
hdb: no response (status = 0xa1), resetting drive
hdb: no response (status = 0xa1)
hdc: no response (status = 0xa1), resetting drive
hdc: no response (status = 0xa1)
hdd: no response (status = 0xa1), resetting drive
hdd: no response (status = 0xa1)
I have a feeling that this is significant, as once I was able to get our man
in Cali to completely disable all onboard IDE controllers (we run 100% SCSI
using Adaptec 2940UWs, but the OOPSen flared up when on an NCR53c875 we
decided to test), the oops now SEEM to have totally dissolved... I'm writing
in hopes that it could be confirmed that this is indeed the source of the
error (to let me sleep sounder at night) and if it's a specific board-related
issue I can find out the model number so you all can avoid it. ;)
