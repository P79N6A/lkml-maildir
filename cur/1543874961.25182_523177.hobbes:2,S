Is anybody having problems with optical drives and this kernel ?
I can't get my dvdrw to spit any events to udevmonitor. If I mount it
manually everything works fine.
Perhaps the problem is in hal/g-v-m or anything else, but I suppose that
udevmonitor receives events directly from kernel, isn't it ?
TIA
