It was the removal of the file I objected against - not thremoval of the
dependency.
kbuild will find the dpendency as expressed in the Makefile
all by itself.

I looked at how inflate was used:
$ grep inflate */boot/Makefile
alpha/boot/Makefile:$(obj)/misc.o: lib/inflate.c
=> redundandt dependency, can be deleted
powerpc/boot/Makefile:zlib       := inffast.c inflate.c inftrees.c
powerpc/boot/Makefile:zlibheader := inffast.h inffixed.h inflate.h inftrees.h infutil.h
powerpc/boot/Makefile:$(addprefix $(obj)/,$(zlib)): $(obj)/%: $(srctree)/lib/zlib_inflate/%
powerpc/boot/Makefile:$(addprefix $(obj)/,$(zlibheader)): $(obj)/%: $(srctree)/lib/zlib_inflate/%
=> I could not see why powerpc had to do so much special magic to
get a working zlib - other archs has less troubles...
Did not llok at all archs but some other had funny stuff to use inflate
and friends too. A cleanup of all this is needed.
