Is "for fun" not reason enough?
I'm still keeping an eye out for firm "behavioural" bug reports on 2.6 and 
would discuss or address them.
Seriously the only reason I went down the rewrite path was to address 
complaints about the complexity of the current design. It was also an 
opportunity to start implementing some requested features. I certainly have 
never suggested it should even be considered for 2.6.
