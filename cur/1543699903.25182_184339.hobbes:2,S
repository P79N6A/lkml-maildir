Sigh.  Tupshin, everyone hates these discussions and I'm in agreement with 
them.  What you want to discuss isn't about kernel development, it's about
building SCM systems.  There are better places to do that than here.  
If you need clarification on whether you are violating our license, consult
a lawyer.
