Very useful for all kinds of "must-exist" files... IAW lock files etc
(especially when you're using a stupid Linux distribution which keeps
messing with your files and you're too lazy to check out what it's doing;)
... now this raises another question to my mind:
Would it be possible to create immutable symlinks in a clean way w/ ext2?
# pwd
/var/run
# ls -ld . mysql* mysql/*
drwxr-xr-x   4 root     root         1024 Mar  4 19:44 .
drwxr-xr-x   2 mysql    mysql        1024 Feb 23 15:56 mysql
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           16 Mar  4 19:44 mysql.sock -> mysql/mysql.sock
srwxrwxrwx   1 mysql    root            0 Feb 23 15:56 mysql/mysql.sock
-rw-r--r--   1 mysql    root            3 Feb 23 15:56 mysql/mysqld.pid
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           16 Mar  4 19:44 mysqld.pid -> mysql/mysqld.pid
... get my point on why immutable symlinks would be very useful? ;)
