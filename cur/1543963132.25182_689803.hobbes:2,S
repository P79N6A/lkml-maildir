Hrmm.. So the issue persisting over the lifetime of the kernel is a new
one by me. This may also have some effect in scheduling decisions (not
necessarily causing a correctness issue, but a performance one). Also it
may have some effect on thread cputime values.
Please do open a bug and provide example dmesg output. I'll try to tag
some folks who have access to the same system type. 
thanks
