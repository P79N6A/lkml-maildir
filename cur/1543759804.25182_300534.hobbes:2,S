Yes, the second case that I described when I said there were two cases!
(Sheesh.)  To repeat, when the process was doing PTRACE_SINGLESTEP and then
stops on some other signal rather than because of the single-step trap
(e.g. single-stepping an instruction that faults), ptrace will show TF set
in its registers.  With my patch, it will show TF clear.

Fedora kernels use a normal mapping (with randomized location) for the
page, rather than the fixed high address in the vanilla kernel.  The
FIXADDR_USER_START area is globally mapped in a special way not using
normal vma data structures, and is permanently read-only in all tasks.  
COW via ptrace works normally for Fedora's flavor, but no writing is ever
possible to the fixmap page.
Thanks,
Roland
