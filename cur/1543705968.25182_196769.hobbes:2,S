Ah ... that's the problem. That's not a valid config - the correct way
to do that is with generic arch, not the PC one. Somehow we ended up
leaving that as allowable ... I think that was just a communiciation
breakdown somewhere between you, Andi, and myself (or quite possibly
between myself and myself ;-)).
So ... I still think my original patch is correct (there's some stylistic
stuff we could debate, but it's not a functional problem). Here's an
additional patch that stops people from turning on NUMA for the PC
subarch, which it wasn't designed to work with.
Thanks,
M.

Disallow NUMA on the i386 PC subarch (it doesn't work, nor was it intended to).
