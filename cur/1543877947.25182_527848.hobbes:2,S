OK.  I assume that bitmap->chunks in bitmap_init_from_disk() has some
unexpectedly large value.
I don't _think_ there's anything in -mm which would have triggered this. 
Does mainline do the same thing?
I guess it's possible that the code in git-md-accel.patch accidentally
broke things.  Perhaps try disabling CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE?

hm.  I always Bcc linux-kernel-announce@vger.kernel.org.  I assume that its
filters didn't get updated after the s/osdl/linux-foundation/ thing.  I'll
talk to people, thanks.
