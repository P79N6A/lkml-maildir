I used to have similar problems. You've probably got a rev D board from
Netgear.  If the big chip says "Netgear" you need a different driver. 
It just so happens that I have a rev D board, and am in possession of
just the driver you're looking for. Big thanks go to David Lerner who
sent this to me. It comes from the Netgear 4.01 driver package, but that
comes as a dos/windows .exe, which isn't convienient for many of us.
There's a makefile included, just type 'make tulip.o' to build the
driver.  You might want to test it with 
'/etc/rc.d/init.d/network stop; rmmod tuilp; insmod ./tulip.o;
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network start' 
before you replace the driver in the lib/modules/<version>/net dir.
