The whole algorithem has already been shown to be effective in IRIX,
see their USENIX 1998 paper.  Especially large memory apps that result
in TLB thrashing may gain tremendously, the paper has some benchmark.
HP did a similar thing for HPUX and did present it the year before,
also with very positive results.
