Subject: [PATCH] linux-2.5.69_clear-smi-fix_A1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

All, 
	I've been having problems with ACPI on a box here in our lab. Some of
our more recent hardware requires that SMIs are routed through the
IOAPIC, thus when we clear_IO_APIC() at boot time, we clear the BIOS
initialized SMI pin. This basically clobbers the SMI so we can then
never make the transition into ACPI mode. 
This patch simply reads the apic entry in clear_IO_APIC to make sure the
delivery_mode isn't dest_SMI. If it is, we leave the apic entry alone
and return.
With this patch, the box boots and SMIs function properly.
Please consider for inclusion.
thanks
