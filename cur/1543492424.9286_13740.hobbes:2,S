There is kdb at
http://reality.sgi.com/slurn_engr/
But it is for 2.2.x kernels. Did you say you are debugging 2.0.x?
Just upgrade your stuff to 2.2.x (which you should do anyway) and you
should be okay.
There are also other very useful things:
a) patch-ikd
b) remote gdb over serial line
c) elf-kcore
d) KME
Search and you shall find.
Hope it helps,
Tigran.
