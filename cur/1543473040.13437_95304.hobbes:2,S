Hi, 
I sent the patches to update the DC390/AM53C974/tmscsim PCI SCSI driver to
2.0d to Alan and Linus for inclusion.
Just have a look at the new web page: 
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/dc390/

2.0c4 has been out for 4 weeks now and successfully tested by many people,
so 2.0d is definitely stable.
Since the version (2.0b/2.0b1) included into the kernel, there are a few
changes:
* Fixed initialization. There were error messages on SMP machines, harmless,
  though. (2.0b1)
* I had used the AM53C974 Erase on Write feature to allow for better
  information for debugging. This had to be removed, as it caused problems
  to one of my testers (Hubert). (2.0b2/3)
* When the target initiated a sync nego with unacceptable parameters, the
  driver misbehaved. This was fixed in 2.0c3.
* I tried to do a performance optimization by reading the remaining bytes of
  multibyte SCSI messages without triggering additional IRQs, but as it takes
  quite some time until the next bvytes arrive, this did not result in
  better performance. I removed this, again.
* Put my new e-mail address and new web site into MAINTAINER and the docu of
  the driver. The web site now contains not only the driver's source code
  but also some useful info ...
And have some nice X-mas days ...
