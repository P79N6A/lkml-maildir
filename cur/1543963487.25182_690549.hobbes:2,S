Because it causes warnings for the callers which don't really care
whether the file gets created or not, and getting rid of those
warnings adds unnecessary bloat.
I think the best solution is to make a new sysfs_maybe_create_file()
which isn't marked must_check, and then move suitable callers (such as
radeonfb) over to that.  That will make it obvious in the callers that
the file creation isn't guaranteed.
Paul.
