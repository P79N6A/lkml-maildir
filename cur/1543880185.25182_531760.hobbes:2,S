Right, this is needed.
My problem wasn't actually this (which would only have hit, if I tried
with more than one user), just that the number of mounts in
/proc/mounts grows linearly with the number of users.
That can't be helped in such an easy way unfortunately.

I still don't believe not propagating "allowusermnt" interferes with
mount propagation.  In my posted patches the mount (including
propagations) is allowed based on the "allowusermnt" flag on the
parent of the requested mount.  The flag is _not_ checked during
propagation.
Allowing this and other flags to NOT be propagated just makes it
possible to have a set of shared mounts with asymmetric properties,
which may actually be desirable.
