I'm wondering why you didn't provide a patch against 2.4.29.
Anyway, I tested it against 2.4.29. I couldn't apply the preemption patch.
The other patches could be applied with a view changes. 2.1.5.7B is
working fine afterwards - even without restarting sleeping hd's during
hibernation! Thank you very much for fixing this problem!
Kind regards,
Andreas Hartmann
