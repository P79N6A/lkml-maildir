Of course I did enable with 
"echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/proxy_arp" :-) check my original
message.
I'm talking about NETMASK proxy arp, not enable-disable.
And the question still remains: 
Why not netmasks ????
It used to work in 2.0.x but in 2.2.x arp.c:
int arp_req_set(struct arpreq *r, struct device * dev)
[.cut text.]
 u32 mask = ((struct sockaddr_in *) &r->arp_netmask)->sin_addr.s_addr;
 if (mask && mask != 0xFFFFFFFF)
    return -EINVAL;
Which means DO NOT ALLOW setting of proxy-arp NETMASKS, and this is the
error you get from arp: INVALID.... 
_WHY_ ???
Bye, Nir.
