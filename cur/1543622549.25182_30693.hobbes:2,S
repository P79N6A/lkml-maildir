I noticed that "hdparm -d1 /dev/hda" timed out three times and reverted
to PIO in my case, with DMA enabled but autoDMA disabled.  So does DMA
support have to be on at boot and is only allowed to be disabled, not
enabled?
If so, ide=dma is the proper solution for trusted boards, but it would
be nice if the /proc or hdparm interfaces worked reliably for enabling
DMA.
So what does this say about the autoDMA issue that I'm seeing?  For me,
the best of both worlds is to have DMA enabled, but off by default and
capable of being enabled from userspace (and kernel command line, less
usefully).
Thanks,
