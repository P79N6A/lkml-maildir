Firstly:
You propose to implement
		modprobe fails (due to crypto requirements)
		open /dev/console
			-ENODEV
		log error to nowhere
Why is this useful - you now get failing module loads producing no
diagnostics and in many case the setup just dying silently. Previously
you got an attempt to recover and diagnostics which allowed the problem
to be found (as Herbert did)
Secondly:
If I have a /dev/console on a PCI device and I have modprobe set to load
8250_pci or a framebuffer driver when the console is opened you will
break the current working behaviour.
