Ok, cool. Note that I also posted a longer series of patches that does
this and much more. Unfortunately, I have suspended working on it for
now, so it's probably better to first get your stuff in.

I think we need to have it in the long run, but if you don't need it
for x25, then it's not your call to implement net_device->compat_ioctl.
I've been thinking about how to get it right before, but did not
reach a proper conclusion, since dev_ioctl is called in so many places
that would all need to be changed for this.

The proto ioctls are all forwarded from sock ioctls, so in theory
it would be needed.

Please post that patch now as well, just make a series out of this
socket compat_ioctl patch and your x25 patch so it becomes clear
that they depend on each other. It should be easier to justify the
infrastructure patch when there is an actual user for it ;-)

I really don't like the way you are extending the SOCKCALL_WRAP
mechanism like this. Ideally, you should convert the x25 layer to
not need SOCKOPS_WRAP at all.
Besides x25, only four other users of this remain, all others have
gotten rid of it. If you have a really good reason to keep it, it's
probably easier to add the compat_ioctl method unconditionally so
you don't need two different version of SOCKOPS_WRAP.
Making it unconditional would also help with those protocols that
have only compatible ioctl handlers and could then also point
.compat_ioctl to their native ioctl method without needing #ifdef
around it.
