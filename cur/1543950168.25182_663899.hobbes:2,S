Well, that's just a small subset of the APIs. There are a lot of other

I don't quite agree with your analogy here. The point here is that each
resource manager operates in its own area, and has already been assigned
some resources which it cannot change. Its more like you can take $x at
the most from the account and your wife $y with x+y<=total money.
