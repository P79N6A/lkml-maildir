Hi all.
I seem to have created some confusion.
I'm leaving Cyclades and switching occupations back to Christian ministry, but 
I'm _not_ going to stop supporting Suspend2. I still love Linux and want to 
help make it the best it can be, and I'm still going to be eating my own dog 
food, so I'll be keeping it going on vanilla, and maybe -mm if I can find the 
time and it's trivial enough.
Hope that helps.
Nigel
