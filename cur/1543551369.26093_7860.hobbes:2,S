You mean you don't use 'patch -E'?
Hmmm, the kernel README file doesn't mention -E either.
It also says to use -p0, which only works if your kernel directory is
still named 'linux', which doesn't tend to last long when you start
managing multiple trees.
Alan, would you put this in 2.2.18pre?  The '-p1' part isn't essential
-- though it's a good habit to get into -- but '-E' can be in some
cases.  (Remember arch/i386/checksum.c?)
