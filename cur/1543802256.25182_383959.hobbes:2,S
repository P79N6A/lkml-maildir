Understood, and it makes sense to yank that compat cruft from kernel.org codebases.
But it seems useful for projects outside the kernel which would like to know 
which kernel they are building against, as far as the build system goes.  I've 
seen a few drivers out there that try to keep building for both 2.4 & 2.6.
I guess for 2.4 & 2.6, the same can be accomplished by using Makefile and 
Kbuild for 2.4 and 2.6....
Maybe you can export it only if KBUILD_EXTMOD is set :)
Thanks,
