if you have two clean trees something like "-urN"; if you've used one
or both of them to build a kernel add "--exclude-from lkdontdiff" where
lkdontdiff is a file listing all objects you don't want to appear in
the patch.
If your diff supports the "-p" option use that too -- it's not perfect
but often is enough to not have to look at the original files while
reading the patch.
