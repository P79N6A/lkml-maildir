but even for new non-generic per-arch code a couple of security holes 
were introduced due to the existing semantics of user_mode(). So this 
indeed changes semantics and it's totally intentional.
so i think we should bite the bullet and should apply this patch. We 
have a constant influx of user_mode() using code and as practice has 
shown it, people dont really consider the vm86 angle of it.
