The code is obviously correct, and the people with the problem
have reported that this approach solves it.
If this bit of functionality is to even work we need to do
something like this.
So I don't see what benefit putting this in -mm would give.  If
I was aggressive I would say that this needs to be in 2.6.13.N.
If I'm not following some procedure I don't have a problem
changing though.
This is the final fix I know of to get a consistent set of semantics
for the everything in the ``reboot path''.
From a practical standpoint I am very tardy in getting this out.
