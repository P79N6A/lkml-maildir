Say rather than restrict rights they define where your rights end and 
the rights
of another person begin. Rather they "balance" rights by drawing a line 
between
the rights of individuals and the rights of the state. The complex case 
is something
called a "compelling interest". i.e. The government has a compelling 
interest to
protect citizens from killing each other.

There are so many laws, you need to have courts in order to perform
"balancing tests" between the rights of individuals (courts of equity)
and the rights of the governement (compelling interests vs. the rights 
of Individuals)

Why Dick, we have something in common -- we are both libertarians (political
party that believes less laws and governemtn control is a very good thing).
