Unfortunately that would add cruft in a number of places.  At the
moment, context switch, ptrace and vm86 all assume entry.S has saved %gs
into pt_regs, so they can treat it like any other register.  If this
were conditional, it would require multiple places to add #ifndef
CONFIG_SMP code, which is not something I'd like to do without a good
reason.
