Probably not. ia64 systems (and x86 systems with IO xapic) direct
IO interrupts to specific CPUs. Devices would not get serviced
in the above case and IO to/from those devices would come to a
grinding halt. It would look more like "dead" lock than "live" lock.

yes. But it sounds very likely to me.
