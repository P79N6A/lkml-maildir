Does this check break existing namespace semantics in a subtle way?
It now requires that unshare() of namespaces by any task requires
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.
clone(.., CLONE_NEWUTS, ..)->copy_namespaces()->ns_container_clone()->
	->container_clone()-> .. -> container_create() -> ns_create()
Earlier, one could unshare his uts namespace w/o CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capabilities. Now it is required. Is that fine? Don't know.
I feel we can avoid this check totally and let the directory permissions
take care of these checks.
Serge, what do you think?
