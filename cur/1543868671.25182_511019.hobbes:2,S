Using the container name is bad and it led to this stupid argument.
The fundamental unit of what we have merged into the kernel is the
namespace.  The aggregate of all namespaces and everything is the
container.
Please, please pick a different name so people don't take one look
at your stuff and get confused like Sam did.

For the case of namespaces I don't see how your code makes things
better.  I do not see a real problem that you are solving.
I do agree that a common interface to the code and a common set of
infrastructure may help.
Personally until the pid namespace (which includes within it process
groupings) is complete I'm not certain the problem will be concrete
enough to solve.  Hopefully we can have a working version of that
shortly.
