Hi!
USB is getting into stage where it is actually usefull. And I've
experienced first clashes with other devices. Therefore, it is time to
allocate entries.
Previous numbers are unusable :-(: their either crash with existing
device, or there's only convient room for one such device where around
16 are needed.
