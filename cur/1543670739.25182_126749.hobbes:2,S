Hello!
Quite some months ago I raised some questions, got some answers and 
continued working silently until my problem was solved. While digging 
the archives for yet another IDE problem today I realized I did
not send any message to you guys nor to the list afterwards.
Just in case someone is interested or cares still:
1) Sorry for not sending a "problem solved" mail when it was solved
2) My box is running smoothly again. It was neither a kernel issue
   nor a hardware problem with the disks. Different kernel versions 
   did behave differently, but the cause of it all seems to be a broken
   CPU (or broken jumper settings). 
   Installing a new CPU made all problems go away. And the box is
   rock solid with or without IDE-DMA turned on.
    Regards
        Florian
P.S: A little block quoted below in case someone wants to remember what
     this was about:
