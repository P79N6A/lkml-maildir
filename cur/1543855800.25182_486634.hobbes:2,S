Subject: mass-storage problems with Archos AV500

I've got an Archos AV500 here (running the very latest firmware), pretty
much acting as a doorstop, since I cannot get it to be recognized
properly by Linux.
This device has two modes, and one usb-id for each:
Windows device mode:
0e79:1129
mass storage mode:
0e79:1128
I didn't really expect any luck with the former (and didn't have any
either), but I was kind of hoping that the latter would be supported.
Not so.
Relevant info from dmesg:

This is with linux-image-2.6.19-7-generic 2.6.19-7.10 from Ubuntu edgy.
I get similar results with a home-brew 2.6.18-rc4.
Any mass storage quirk needed that might be missing?
