I have four machines on my desk at the moment. The workstation is a dual 
P-III. I suppose I agree that it might be nice if the kernel for that also 
worked on the embedded 386 board. But it'd also be nice if it worked on the 
Alpha and the SH boards which are also on my desk. How about putting the 
whole lot into a single kernel image? It's the logical extension of what's 
being suggested.
