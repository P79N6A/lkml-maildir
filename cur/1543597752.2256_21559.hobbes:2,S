Ah, now THAT is a good idea.
Compressing groups of pages, probably 16k at a time, and storing them on 20k
boundaries will result in a loss of swap space but a probable increase in
speed. And the boundary alignment will probably simplify bookkeeping. You
shouldn't be using swap anyways, so a 20% loss probably isn't a huge deal.
Maybe someone with a little more experience in the area of swap management
under Linux should take over the discussion from here...
