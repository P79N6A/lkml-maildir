Pointer operations and word size operations are atomic. So this is mostly
okay.
The issue arises on architectures that have a large pte size than the
wordsize. This is only on i386 PAE mode and S/390. S/390 falls back to
the page table lock  for these operations. PAE mode should do the same and
not use atomic ops if they cannot be made to work in a reasonable manner.
