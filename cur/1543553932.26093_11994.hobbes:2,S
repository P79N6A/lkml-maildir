I currently do not use either APM or ACPI. Initially I used ACPI
and removing it in test8 appeared to fix the problem (but I suspect
that was just 'appear' rather than 'fix' 8-). I moved to APM instead
of ACPI in test9 - no change, and indeed in test10 I use neither.
There is a flag in the BIOS for Plug n Play OS. I shall toggle it and
observe the results.
