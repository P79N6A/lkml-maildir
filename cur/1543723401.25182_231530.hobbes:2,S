Thks, folks, I wouldn't really suspect of bad cables/PSU, this was an
eye-opener. I have just opened the box and reseated the 80-wire IDE
cable to my hda device, and I will consider replacing it, just in case.
The PSU is brand new, 450W -- although it could be bad quality, I will
try to check this out.
BTW: Nick, I missed your msg because you didn't cc me. My hda also
usually gets disconnected at early hours in the morning, as you pointed
out. I arrived today to work and it had happened again =/ Last entry
on/var/log/messages was around 1:30am, and it was about a NFS mount that
had expired.
Best,
Andre
