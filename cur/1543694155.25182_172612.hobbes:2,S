It's not the instruction manual. It's kernel API documentation, for the 
kernel code, used by kernel developers.
Then again, I'm happy to be wrong on this. I suggest you develop and 
submit a patch to address your concerns. The patch should probably take 
account of:
 - the existing formatted documentation comments
 - the existing code to turn those comments into docbook 
(scripts/kernel-doc)
 - the existing man page generation scripts (scripts/makeman 
scripts/split-man)
 - the difficulty of keeping separate HTML documentation in sync with the 
code
 - the fact that docbook is the accepted standard for open source 
documentation (including the ldp)
I look forward to reading your patch.
Cheers,
Mikal
