I have just one question about this "Press Release".  If nobody 
posting drafts is really interested in improvements, why post the 
drafts at all?
I have seen spelling errors, grammatical follies, and entirely
nonsensical statements propagated uncorrected from draft to 
draft.  For example, the "latest" still has the almost-idiotic:
  This update includes an advanced collection of low-level features.
What in blazes is an "advanced collection"?  How is one collection
more "advanced" than another?  Who would want a bunch of "low-level 
features" when they could have high-level ones?
I posted replacement text in 
  
http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9901_03/msg01519.html
which fixes this and other problems.  The "final" draft, 
incidentally, also introduces a new misspelling which I
will point out if anybody is really interested.
Maybe union rules require that press releases contain really dumb 
mistakes, but what does it say about the reliability of open-source 
software if we can't even get a bloody two-page press release right?
[Rhetorical question.]
