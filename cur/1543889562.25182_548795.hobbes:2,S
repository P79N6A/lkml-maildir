Yes, please, this is the normal way.

Function attributes don't need to appear in function definitions at all.
(I've not come across such cases often, so this is certainly not the
standard). Anyway, the above is a case that the function lacks a
separate declaration which is why we put it there at the definition.
And yes, if we really do have to put an attribute in the function
definition, then we do need to place it _before_ the function name.

Ok, so if you're really planning to do this cleanup, you can do the
following (for all occurrences of NORET_TYPE):
1. If this is a function _declaration_ (i.e. a prototype in some
header or some .c file), then remove the NORET_TYPE macro. Also,
if an ATTRIB_NORET or NORET_AND already exists then you're done.
Else, introduce an ATTRIB_NORET after the arglist but before ;
2. If this is a function _definition_, then remove the NORET_TYPE
macro.
	(a) If a _declaration_ also exists somewhere (say, some
	    header or in the same .c file) for this function, then go
	    and check it.
		(i) If it already contains an ATTRIB_NORET or
		    NORET_AND, then you're done.
		(ii) Else, introduce ATTRIB_NORET.
	(b) If no separate declaration exists for this function,
	    then just introduce the ATTRIB_NORET _before_ the
	    function name if it isn't there already.
I suspect the above would cover all cases :-)
