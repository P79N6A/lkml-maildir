I do _not_ know. It can be proved only by experience.
In current 2.3 the feature is missing and the effect
is really purely negative.
[ Even worse, to be honest, it is just buggy. I think you will see this,
  if several times restart loaded slave daemon, while khttpd is also
  enough loaded. TCP will be confused eventually. ]

Yes. It must keep this socket open. Otherwise we will have to redesign
all the logic not to rely on the fact that open files are really open 8)
