This is gonna go on forever.
I tried[1], but I guess development HAS to be in the "stable" branch and
can't be shipped to a similarly managed "volatile" branch for
development, since it obviously makes such a big difference to mainline
kernel developers and less so to home users, third party developers, and
businesses and institutions who rely on a mostly stable codebase to
avoid surprise breakage.
Is this a serious operating system or a running experiment?  Running
experiments have no place in production; if your "stable" mainline
branch is going to continuously add and remove features and go through
wild API and functionality changes, nobody is going to want to use it.
Mozilla doesn't support IE's broken crap "because IE is a moving
target."  Unpredictable API changes and changes to the deep inner
workings of the kernel will make the kernel "a moving target."  If
that's the route you take, it will become too difficult for people to
develope for linux.
