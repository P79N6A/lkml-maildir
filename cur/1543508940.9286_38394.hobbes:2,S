this could be a lost RTC IRQ. If you are using 2048 Hz RTC interrupts, it
just needs a single 1msec IRQ delay to lose an RTC IRQ. Especially SCSI
disk interrupts are known to sometimes cause 1-2 millisecs IRQ delays.  
But before jumping to conclusions, what exactly are the symptoms, what
does 'one IRQ period later' mean exactly?
