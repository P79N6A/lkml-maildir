G'day all,
I have been using 2.6.5 happily for a while now on this machine.
It's an Asus A7V600 with 3 Promise SATA150-TX4 SATA cards.
With 2.6.6 (and 2.6.6-bk3) it hangs with a dma timeout on boot detecting the 9th sata drive (there 
are 10). I left it for about 10 minutes to see if anything else transpired but it just sat there.
I'm on a serial console to this machine at the moment and I could not get it to respond to the magic 
sysrq key over serial either.
I have placed all relevant info including a capture of 2.6.5 boot and 2.6.6 boot, plus all requested 
info from linux/REPORTING-BUGS on my webpage
Normal working dmesg
http://www.wasp.net.au/~brad/2.6.5.log
Hung up dmesg
http://www.wasp.net.au/~brad/2.6.6.log
.config and all other info I could gather.

Much as I'd love to be subscribed, I just can't keep up with the volume so please cc: me.
Willing to try patches/hacks/suggestions
Actually, while I'm here I just connected 2 sata drives to the onboard via sata ports and 2.6.5 
won't detect them. All relevant info is in the logs.
insmod sata_via just silently loads and nothing occurs. The onboard raid bios detects the drives 
fine and I have no raid created or enabled.
Regards,
Brad
