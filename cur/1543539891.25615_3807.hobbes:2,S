You want me to shutdown entire machine just to update firmware on
one of /pub disks (which I can umount and mount again)? And then you
want me to mess with some boot images (should I connect FDD to this
machine for just that?) rather than just rebooting the system and have
it ready within a minute or two (if stupid disks need power-on reset)?
