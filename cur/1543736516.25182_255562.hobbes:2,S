I think it is possible to have a defragmenter: allocate new page, 
invalidate mapped pte's, invalidate radix tree entry (and block radix lookups),`
copy data from oldpage to newpage, remap pte's, insert radix tree
entry, free oldpage.
The memory hotplug patches do it - I'm trying to implement a similar version
to free physically nearby pages and form high order pages.
