yes, by the code, if it's C.  In .h if it's C++.

We have might_sleep(), assert_spin_locked(), BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled()), etc.
I like assertions personally.  If we had something like:
void foo(args)
{
	locals;
	assert_irqs_enabled();
	assert_spin_locked(some_lock);
	assert_in_atomic();
	assert_mutex_locked(some_mutex);
then we get documentation which is (optionally) checked at runtime - best
of both worlds.  Better than doing it in kernel-doc.  Automatically
self-updating (otherwise kernels go BUG).
But we'd need to sell the idea ;)
And we still need to document those return values in English.
(Or we do
	return assert_zero_or_errno(ret);
which is a bit ug, but gets us there)
