Yes. On the other hand, I'm really hoping that since the whole procedure
is so simple, after a few times this has happened, people will just do the
sign-off without even thinking about it. So the "come back with a
signed-off version" case hopoefully doesn't happen too much.
So we'll have it for a while (and I'll probably add a check to my "apply"
scripts to _check_ for the sign-off thing at least for anything bigger
than a few lines), but I'm _hoping_ that in half a year people will wonder 
why we even discussed this.
And I might be wrong. Maybe it's just going to be a constant irritant, and 
we'll have to just revisit the issue and decide that it was a stupid idea.
