Well, it sounds like this machine is going to be 100% io-bound with
simple-to-optimise linear reads and writes.  This is something Linux is pretty
well tuned for already.  The best bet might be to set up md and put the SCSI
disks in a RAID configuration.  If integrity isn't important (all your
datafiles are copies from somewhere else) then just plain striping will
probably help a lot.
