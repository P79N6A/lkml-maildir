Actually a 1 Mb/s connection is 1024000 bits/second (ie not 1000000 or
1048576 bits/second).
This came about because a basic voice channel is 64kb/s = 64000
bits/second.  These are aggregated up into 32 channels at a time which
is known as an E1 in Europe.  An E1 is known as a 2 "meg" connection
though it is 2048000 bits/s.  Perhaps the correct appellation is 2
kkib/s?
Poor confused telecoms engineers ;-)
My personal view is that the kiB MiB GiB etc are very ugly but we
should grin and bear it to banish this decimal binary confusion
forever.  Either that or put a note somewhere saying that all k, M and
G are 2^10, 2^20 and 2^30 and forget about it for a generation...
