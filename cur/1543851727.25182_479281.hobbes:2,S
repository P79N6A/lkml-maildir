Well that wasn't the impression I got:

  It's the pushfl that will be slow on any OoO CPU, as it has dependancies on 
  any previous instructions that modified the flags, which ends up bringing 
  all of the memory ordering dependancies into play.  Doing a popfl to set the 
  flags to some known value is much less expensive.
And benchmarks seem to support that, even on K8:
 lmbench context switch, 50 runs
        before  after
    avg  1.09   1.05
 stddev   .25    .18
But P4 is the real problem case and I can't test that.
