But we don't want "acpismp=force" to work, it now serves no purpose
but to confuse.  May I push again to Marcelo my patch you acked
before, which removes it completely?  I had been waiting to say it's
in 2.6, but Andrew didn't push it from 2.5-mm into 2.6 - any reason?
Whereas we would still like "noht" to work, but it's now beyond me.
