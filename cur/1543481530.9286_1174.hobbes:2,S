Further investigation revealed that the culprit is the vfork() change
introduced in pre9. In both cases (modprobe and loadkeys), the C
library tried to sys_vfork() upon a call to system() or popen().
In pre8 and earlier kernels, this resulted in -ENOSYS and libc performed
a fork() instead (__libc_system calls __vfork which is defined as
pid_t
__vfork __P ((void))
{
  pid_t retval = INLINE_SYSCALL (vfork, 0);
  if (retval == (pid_t) -1 && errno == ENOSYS)
    retval = INLINE_SYSCALL (fork, 0);
  return retval;
}
). (This is GLibc 2.0.110. The problem will also be reported to the
libc-alpha mailing list).
In pre9, the new vfork system call is performed, and this results
(for some reasons that I have yet to investigate) in a seg fault
in the calling process. Backing out the change to entry.S so that
syscall(__NR_vfork) returns ENOSYS resolves the symptom.
Hope this helps,
Thomas.
