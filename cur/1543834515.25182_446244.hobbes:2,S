Subject: [PATCH] [efs] Add entry for EFS filesystem to MAINTAINERS as Orphan
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/24/202

The EFS filesystem does not have an entry in MAINTAINERS; add one, giving the
EFS filesystem and listing the status as Orphan, per the note on that page
saying "I'm no longer actively maintaining EFS".
