I am not sure I understand a question (it is not my native language) but here I 
simply do
mkinitrd --omit-ide-modules --preload pata_ali --preload sd_mod ...
or
mkinitrd --omit-scsi-modules --preload alim15x3 --preload ide-disk ...
If you ask how --omit part is implemented I happily send you mkinitrd script.
