And I don't want to expand on it, because otherwise this thread goes 
completely elsewhere again and I want to keep the focus on this patch.
These are two different problems, which have have only in common that it's 
about rounding of time.

You have a weird definition of "regression", since when is a bug fix a 
regression? We can discuss whether it's the correct fix and I described 
earlier in this thread the basic problem, which the current 2.6 behaviour 
fixes. I'd really prefer if we could based on that discuss a proper fix, 
instead of just falling back to the wrong 2.4 behaviour.
bye, Roman
