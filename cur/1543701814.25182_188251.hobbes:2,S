Ok, Andries, time for you to take a deep breath, and calm down. Because 
your arguments are getting ridiculous in the extreme.
A NFS server is sure as hell not going to export _its_ dynamic /dev to its 
clients. That would be not just stupid, but crazy. Next you tell me that 
you were using devfs and exporting that over NFS. 
A NFS server is going to export something _totally_ different than its own 
/dev directory - it needs to be _client_-specific anyway. That's true with 
stable numbers too, btw - ever tried to mount a Solaris /dev on a Linux 
client? No workee.

No. It still works. Even if the device numbers change across reboots.
Why? Becuase that _program_ sure as hell isn't running across a reboot.
And again, this is not something we haven't seen before. Have you ever 
looked at the "st_dev" values? Try once - look at what it returns for a 
NFS-mounted filesystem. Ponder. Notice how it already is NOT stable across 
reboots.
In other words, the stuff you're complaining about is all stuff that 
nobody has _ever_ been able to rely on, and that has nothign to do with 
udev or anythign else. It all just shows how 100% right I am for saying 
that you cannot rely on stable numbers.
So I repeat: calm down, and think it through.
