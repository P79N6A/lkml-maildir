But why would you go back to an older kernel if you are using all this great
functionality?  Similarly, is anyone using the ext filesystem?  I didn't
think it was even maintained anymore.  Why would you begin to rely on the
great new features in ext2 if you can't use them in ext?  (I don't actually
know what the differences are, but figured everyone else does so it would be
a good comparison).  Why would you want to use the new threads or clone
system call?  You sure can't run programs that rely on it on a 0.96 kernel!
Needless to say, I don't think this is a very persuasive argument...
