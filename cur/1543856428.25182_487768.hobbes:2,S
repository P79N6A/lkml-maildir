That's a valid point, but in fact, building with NFS client and serial
port support in the kernel on some archs is as common as building with
IDE driver and VGA console in the kernel on x86. With some architectures
used in light networked workstations, it's very common to boot from the
network (sparc & parisc come to mind, sorry to those I forgot), hence
this common practise.

That's again where we see the limits of this ever-developping 2.6.
I'm not saying that doing this from initramfs+tools is a bad solution,
since it solves lots of problems, it's just that it is *much* different
from what was previously done.
People who have installed a distro on their machines will not be
able to upgrade their kernel past a certain point by hand. Upgrading
distro packages in such environments is generally not always an
option (particularly boot packages such as boot loader and kernel),
because the boot server is not necessarily running on the same
OS/distro, and sometimes the kernel needs different build options.
Then the remaining solution to get stability and security fixes
is often to [cross-]compile a more recent kernel, and to put it
on the boot server. Fortunately Adrian maintains 2.6.16 :-/
