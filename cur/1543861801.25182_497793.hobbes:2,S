Yes, and we can remove a dead CPU safely, this part is ok.

but at some point we should thaw processes, including cwq->thread which
should die. So we are doing things like take_over_work() and this is the
source of races, because the dead CPU is not on cpu_online_map.
flush_workqueue() doesn't use any locks now. If we use freezer to implement
cpu-hotplug nothing will change, we still have races.
It looks so obvious to me, so I'm starting to suspect I missed something
very simple :(
