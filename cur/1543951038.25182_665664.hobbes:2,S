BUT ...
to do that, I would need to know already a bit of memmap ?!
This is a Chicken-egg-problem ! 
And I won't "waste" my time if i've a solution at hand already ?!
Lets do it like this: Show me what i need to know about the usage of memmap 
and i'll write some doc. 
Just shouting "write your own doc" is pointless, as I don't know this part of 
the kernel myself (yet).
Best regards
Jan-Simon
