Several people emailed me with similar comments.  It seems I
occasionally have this habit of making myself look foolish.  The
explanation is this:  Yesterday I put a new processor and motherboard
into the system.  When I set up the BIOS I put in a date one day into
the future.  This morning's cron job called a remote time server which
corrected the date.  When I compiled the kernel this morning, confusion
reigned.  Sorry for bothering everyone.  Touching the files did fix the
problem.  I'll probably find a few more floating around causing problems
until 0302 tomorrow morning when I'm past all the future dates.
The motherboard change was instructive as was going from a K6-2 to an
Athlon.  Linux booted up without a problem while Windows crashed and
burned.  The best part was that I knew what was going to happen and I
had an audience.
