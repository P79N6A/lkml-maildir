Hello, 
	It is fixed
	The problem is that now cpu_up/cpu_down is called with tasks frozen,
	and this can lead to deadlock if some driver that registered cpu up/down notifier, sleeps,
	On my system it froze in two places, one in XFS due to freezable workqueues, and in
	microcode update driver that ask the "frozen" userspace for firmware.
	Fix for XFS is already in mainline, and Rafael J. Wysocki. already posted a patch that fixes microcode issue,
	I will test it.
	But I feel that there are more drivers that can deadlock system in same way, on my system S3/S4 works perfect :-)
	Even the weird  hang i had disappeared.
	Big thanks to Rafael J. Wysocki.
	Best regards,
		Maxim Levitsky
