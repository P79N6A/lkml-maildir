Subject: Re: [PATCH] drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c: No resource probing before pci_enable_device (241p11)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

hi List,
What I can make out from the below statement is that
its better to first enable the device and then
allocate the resources for that.Since from the hot
pluggable point of view if the device is not enabled
,then it does not mean anything to allocate the
resources for it.It would be simply wasting the
resources which serves no good purpose.
If my understanding is incorrect or if there are few
more important  issues attached from the Hot-pluggable
point of view,then please let me know.
Thanks
