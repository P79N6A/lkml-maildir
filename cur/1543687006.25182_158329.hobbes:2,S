I'm looking at one, but the two layers of indirection in cryptoapi make
this tricky.

Locking fixes:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test2/2.6.0-test2-mm4/broken-out/random-locking-fixes.patch
Ignore the changelog, it doesn't match the patch. Instead read what I
wrote to Andrew.
Accounting stuff at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test2/2.6.0-test2-mm4/broken-out/random-accounting-and-sleeping-fixes.patch
The above involved a lot of carefully going over logs with entropy
debugging turned on as most of it wasn't obvious from reading the
code. There are still a couple corner cases in the above but they fall
on the undercounting side. For the separated output pool patch, the xfer
code ends up looking like this, which is much easier to follow:
+static void reseed_pool(struct entropy_store *r, int margin, int wanted)
+{
+       __u32 tmp[TMP_BUF_SIZE];
+       int bytes;
+
+       DEBUG_ENT("reseed %s wants %d bits (margin %d)\n",
+                 r->name, wanted*8, margin);
+
+       /* Never more than can fit in buffer */
+       bytes = min_t(int, wanted, sizeof(tmp));
+       /* Nor more than destination has room for */
+       bytes = min_t(int, bytes, (r->poolinfo->POOLBITS-r->entropy_count)/8);
+       /* Nor too much to starve other pools */
+       bytes = min_t(int, bytes, (input_pool->entropy_count - margin)/8);
+       /* And never less than catastrophic reseed threshold */
+       if(bytes < read_thresh/8)
+               return;
+
+       DEBUG_ENT("trying to reseed %s with %d bits\n", r->name, bytes*8);
+
+       bytes=extract_entropy(input_pool, tmp, bytes, EXTRACT_ENTROPY_LIMIT);
+       add_entropy_words(r, tmp, bytes+3/4);
+       credit_entropy_store(r, bytes*8);
