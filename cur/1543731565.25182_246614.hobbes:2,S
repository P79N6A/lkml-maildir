This has the opportunity to grow and grow and make things really ugly
in all the driver specific Kconfigs each time a new arch switches
over to use drivers/Kconfig.  Is this really any better than doing
this checking in drivers/Kconfig itself and keeping the subdir'd kconfig's
somewhat cleaner ?
Even if not,  I think I'd actually prefer a whitelist of drivers that *do*
support agpgart in the Kconfig, than the above which needs to be added to
all the time.  Something like if X86 && ALPHA && IA64 should cover it currently.
It just seems to me to be a lot more sensible than listing a bunch
of stuff which is completely irrelevant.
