so how does this differ from a normal Linux system that is used
exclusively? The specialized tasks will get evenly distributed between
CPUs (as long as the number of tasks is not higher than the number of
CPUs), and nothing should interrupt them.

yeah. You can schedule processes 'manually' by using affinities - this is
for corner-cases which know it 100% well what they are doing. But the
default scheduler should get the '8 tasks running on an 8-way system' case
right as well - each CPU will run a single number-cruncher, and there wont
be any bouncing.
