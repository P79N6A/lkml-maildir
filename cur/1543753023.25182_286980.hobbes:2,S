Hmm, coming from you I will take this is a pretty strong endorsement
for what I was suggesting earlier: provide a basic buffering mode
in relayfs to be used in kernel debugging. However, it must be
understood that this is separate from the existing modes and ltt,
for example, could not use such a basic infrastructure. If this is
ok with you, and no one wants to complain too loudly about this, I
will go ahead and add this to our to-do list for relayfs.
