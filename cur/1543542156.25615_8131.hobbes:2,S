Do you have any statistics to back this up? I've heard that same
statement before, but it's always asserted without evidence or
argument. While I'm inclined to believe it based on my experience
with other OSes (NT/2000, Solaris, SunOS, OSF/1, Ultrix, MacOS, BSD),
I would like to see some proof, if there's proof to be had.
Thanks!
