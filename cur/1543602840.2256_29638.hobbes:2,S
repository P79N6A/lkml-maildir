Using mtools, such as mdir and mformat, under 2.4.9-ac16 (from
2.4.9-ac10 onwards, IIRC) hard-hangs my linux system....
dual P3/700, SMP kernel, gcc-3.0.1, Abit VP6 with VIA 694X chipset,
mtools-3.9.7

The floppy-drive itself functions quite well in DOS, so it's not that.
The symptoms are easy to describe:
the console hangs, and switching to another doesn't work. Also the
num-lock key is dead. The floppy light stays on, but it doesn't sound
like it is doing anything but spinning the motor.
There are no messages in the system logs.
Any hints on what to do?
Thanks,
Jurriaan
