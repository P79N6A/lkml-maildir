Hi All,
I'm reading the linux kernel 2.6.14. But can't understand how LRU algorithm
is applied to page swapping. what is the 'USED' of LRU referred to? The
reference counter which the page is mapped by processes, or the frequency that
CPU reads/writes in the page. In common sense, the LRU algorithm will be more
optimal for the second case. But it depends on CPU capability.
I will be very appreciated if somebody can explain that in details.
