I see no point in aligning to 32-bit boundaries on 64-bit platforms.
Their intention was most likely to align to the word size IMO, so this
is most likely a "thinko" left over from whoever ported the code from
32-bit to 64-bit.
How we chose to align on 64-bit platforms is another issue, either we
fix it soon or live with the fact that we are not following the 64-bit
draft spec. Either way is fine with me.
