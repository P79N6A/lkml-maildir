Make sure that you have the following option in your kernel;
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y
Then boot the kernel with this kernel parameter;
console=ttyS0,38400
Make necessary adjustments for baud rate and serial port. Then you may 
additionally add a getty on the console with something akin to the 
following /etc/inittab entry;
7:35:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 ttyS0
Finally all you need is a program on the monitoring system, minicom 
should suffice if you have nothing else.
