Subject: [PATCH 0/6] percpu: Per cpu code simplification fixup

This patchset simplifies the code that arches need to maintain to support
per cpu functionality. Most of the code is moved into arch independent
code. Only a minimal set of definitions is kept for each arch.
The patch also unifies the x86 arch so that there is only a single
asm-x86/percpu.h

fixup:
  - rebased from 2.6.24-rc6-mm1 to 2.6.24-rc8-mm1
    (removed changes that are in the git-x86.patch)
  - added back in missing fold-percpu_modcopy pieces
V3->V4:
  - rebased patchset on 2.6.24-rc6-mm1
    (removes the percpu_modcopy changes that are already in.)
  - change config ARCH_SETS_UP_PER_CPU_AREA to a global var
    and use select HAVE_SETUP_PER_CPU_AREA to specify.
V2->V3:
  - fix x86_64 non-SMP case
  - change SHIFT_PTR to SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR
  - fix various percpu_modcopy()'s to reference correct per_cpu_offset()
  - s390 has a special way to determine the pointer to a per cpu area
V1->V2:
- Add support for specifying attributes for per cpu declarations (preserves
  IA64 model(small) attribute).
  - Drop first patch that removes the model(small) attribute for IA64
  - Missing #endif in powerpc generic config /  Wrong Kconfig
  - Follow Randy's suggestions on how to do the Kconfig settings
