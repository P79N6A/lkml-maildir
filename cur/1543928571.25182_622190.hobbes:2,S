Hi All,
[resending as plain text -sorry].
I've had a start at getting rid of sa_state, but I haven't tested it
yet.  It's a pretty straightforward change to just call the new state
routine directly instead of going through the table.  I'll submit that
in the next week or so, or if desired, someone else can take over the
work from the code I have.
