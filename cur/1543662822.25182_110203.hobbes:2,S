Don't we have to take tasklist_lock anyway for when task_state reads
p->real_parent->pid and p->parent->pid? Or should we have to grab
the task_lock for those too? If so, it sounds like it could get into 
rather horrible ordering dependencies to me. 
If we move exit under task_lock ... then tasklist_lock doesn't help us
any more there either (presumably we're trying to stop them exiting 
whilst we look at them) ... I've coded up the stupid approach for now, 
and will check that works first. Should have results very soon.
