Hmmm - that points more to a hardware problem than a software problem;
crashes in generic_file_buffered_write() are relatively uncommon, and
to have them all isolated to a specific type of hardware is suspicious....
Wasn't there a major update of the IDE layer in 2.6.18? or was that
2.6.19 that I'm thinking of? BTW, have you run memtest86 on these
boxes to rule out dodgy memory?
Cheers,
Dave.
