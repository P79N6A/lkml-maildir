Hmm, this conclusion seems to be wrong. at that time, I said it too
early.  The real problem is this, if your box support S3, the _S3 method
should return from ELSE-statement which return package
{0x01,0x01,0x00,0x00}.
If you still use this
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3534#c10
 to
override your DSDT, which bypass the testing and blindly assume BIOS or
platform
do support S3, then I suggest you to retest, and post dmesg with
UN-modified BIOS.
Thanks,
