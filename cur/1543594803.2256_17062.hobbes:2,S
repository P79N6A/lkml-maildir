I picked up a network card that claims to use the "most reliable Realtek
LAN chip".  The big chip is labelled "LAN-8139" so naturally I tried the
8139too driver.  It doesn't find the device.  I'm wondering if maybe it's
just something in the device ID tables.  Here's some info:

The driver disk includes fealnx.[co].  The driver is for 2.0 and has a
reference to Donald Becker's website at NASA.  I don't know if the driver
is based on Becker's work.  There's no GPL.  In fact, there's no license
of any sort in the source.
Any suggestions?
