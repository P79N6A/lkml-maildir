Subject: [OFFTOPIC] Possible idea for integration of Text-based apps?

While thinking about Gnome, X, graphics, and application integration, I
came upon an interesting idea for how to integrate text-based applications.
What if each application were run using a special program.  Let's say
that special program was a go-between between the physical TTY and the
program.  Let's also say the program gave the application a pseudo-TTY
in which to operate.  The go-between program would connect via Unix
domain socket to a master daemon.  The purpose of this whole setup is
stdin/stdout integration with a concept.
Suppose there was an instant messaging program that was aware of this system
(linked with a special library?).  Suppose we were using it right now,
and we were talking to someone.  They posted a URL.  This application gave
us a way to select that URL.  Then, the app would send it to a "registered"
Lynx process, where the TTY of that lynx would be looked up, and the master
daemon connected to that Lynx's go-between process.  The go-between for
the Lynx program then sent the characters "g(URLTEXT from IM program)<enter>"
as if they were typed in from stdin.
Theoretically I think this whole system could be implemented right now in
code.  But the biggest problem would be how each program would use a
pseudo-TTY for the application's I/O channel.
Among all this brainstorming, I would like to know if anyone likes this
idea or think they could expand upon it and possibly help make it a reality.
An idea I had for it is to have every set (or "object") of data transferred
between apps have a special flag on it which refer it to like a special
translation system.  For instance, a URL would be sent to lynx where the
special translation pattern for Lynx would be like "g%d\n" whereas %d
is the string data contained.  Or, suppose there would be something to lookup
users on IRC.  For the IRC client the translation system would make it
"/whois %d\n".  Receiving the stdout of an application seems like a trickier
idea, for there would have to be some language or method of specifying how
much data to read back to app for it, or something like that.
Just some wild post-sleep-deprivation-relief (i.e. sleep) brainstorms.
