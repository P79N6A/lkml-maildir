Two more additional data points,
1) partially kernel-unrelated.  MDK's "make" macro didn't support
alpha's /proc/cpuinfo output, "make -j$numprocs" became "make -j" and
fun ensued.
2) I agree that 200MB into swap and 200MB into cache isn't bad per se,
but when it triggers the OOM killer it is bad.
Alan suggested that I insert the following into the OOM killer code, as
the last test before returning 1.
	cnt++;
	if ((cnt % 5000) != 0)
		return 0;
I did this, and while watching "vmstat 3", the cache was indeed being
trimmed, whereas it was not before.
So, the OOM killer appears to be getting triggered early, but the rest
of the report was my screwup not the kernel.
