I used to read the hand written changelogs, they only used to be a half
page or so; neatly summerising stuff into one line; I can't be bothered
with the full changelogs  - they are obviously useful; but the hand
written half pages are still a lot easier at a quick glance to see if
there is anything that affects you.
Perhaps insisting that each check in message includes a single line (sub
60 chars) description; could turn those into description : name and
remove dupes?
