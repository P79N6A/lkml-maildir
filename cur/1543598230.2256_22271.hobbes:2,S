The Red Hat installation manual claims that the size of the swap partition
should be twice the size of physical memory, but no more than 128MB.
The screaming hotrod machine Gary Sandine and I built around the Tyan S2464
has 2GB of physical memory.  Should I believe the above formula?  If not,
is there a more correct one for calculating needed swap on machines with
very large memory?
(No further hangs, BTW.)
