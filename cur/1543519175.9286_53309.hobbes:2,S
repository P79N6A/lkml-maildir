The ARM issue is not quite that simple.  Even with Config.in fixed, at 
some point between 2.3.18 and 2.3.26 UDMA stopped working on these machines.  
With DMA enabled it seems that blocks read from the disk always contain 
zeros.
I haven't had the time yet to review the changes that were made in that period 
to try to find the problem.
