Well, Duh! You'r eobviously right.
PTRACE_KILL is a special case, since it's supposed to work _regardless_ of 
whether the process being traced is actually stopped for tracing or not.
And Roland is correct that PTRACE_KILL works fine _if_ it is stopped. 
But for the case where it isn't (and Daniel's program isn't, since it did 
the PTRACE_CONT), PTRACE_KILL does nothing.

No, I do believe that PTRACE_KILL is supposed to kill the child even if it 
wasn't synchronized. See the special case for "ptrace_check_attach()", 
which allows a PTRACE_KILL to happen even for a nonsynchronized target.
