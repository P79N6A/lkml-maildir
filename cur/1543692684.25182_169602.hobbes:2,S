Yes, but taking the address of it should still undo all the things.  
"evaluate_addressof()" does the right (fairly complex) magic, but
apparently the "degenerate()" function does not.
Ho humm.. degenerate() really should be 100% the same as 
"evaluate_addressof()", but I'm sure I had some reason for doing them 
separately.
Probably a very bad reason, brought on by terminal mental illness. But a
reason none-the-less..
