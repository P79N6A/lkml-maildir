Sounds good to me.  The higher level code can use this type of clean up.

Sort of but implemented with a dynamic binding as opposed to the current 
compile time binding via ifdefs.
The current HRT code implements a kind of static / compile time polymorphism 
that is hard for me to read and keep straight.  It implements N time bases, 
with M interrupt sources for K architectures.  Implementing the binding logic 
between all these at compile time leads to a lot of ifdefs and hard to grok 
code.

yes but the code in the include/linux/hrtime.h file exports zero abstractions 
to the architecture independent kernel.  
Its mostly a documentation header file, that includes the architecture 
dependent exports, that then need to be used by the architecture independent 
code.  Its all wrapped up in macros and what not to make it work across a 
handful of architectures but its still a significant CTAGS work out to follow 
the logic.
I think that re-working the lower level HRT code to be more object based (like 
pci and net devices for example) with a layered design would significantly 
simplify the code and improve the extensibility across architectures and 
platform hardware time based interrupt sources.
The only performance hit would be that some of the in-lined and compile time 
macro code would no longer be inline-able.
