This is what I get:
root@srv:/# cat /sys/module/speedtch/parameters/enable_isoc

I think it means it confirms the isochronous mode is working.
Especially that I modified the source of the speedtch.c so that the
enable_isoc is on by default.

Many thanks for your great support. I will try the new firmware
tomorrow, as this is a remote machine and I would now risk loosing it
for an entire evening and night in case something goes wrong (usually
it just does go wrong :)
