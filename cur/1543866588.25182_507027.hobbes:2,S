Can you elucidate on _what_ you just checked for?
There was something about alignment of 64-bit arguments to syscalls
which affects MIPS and/or ARM which I can't quite remember-- something
about putting it them arguments in either an even-numbered or
odd-numbered position to make it work nicely. Is that actually written
anywhere, and does anyone bother to check?
