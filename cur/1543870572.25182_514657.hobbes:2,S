Subject: Re: [PATCH (update 2)] timer: Run calc_load halfway through each round_jiffies second
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Whenever jiffies is started at a multiple of 5*HZ or wraps, calc_load is 
run exactly on the second which is when tasks using round_jiffies will 
be scheduled to run. This has a bad effect on the load average, making 
it tend towards 1.00 if a task happens to run every time the load is 
being calculated.
This changes calc_load so that it updates load half a second after any 
tasks scheduled using round_jiffies.

This version starts count off at 0, since LOAD_FREQ + HZ/2 is no better 
than LOAD_FREQ, and avoids rounding it to a negative value.
