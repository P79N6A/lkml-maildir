This problem comes up periodically and when it does there
results in a bunch of noise to show that "Linux works perfectly...",
but never with any resolution.
What needs to be answered by persons who know the network
code is how one "connects" a particular response to a
particular device.
This has become a FAQ and needs to have some written documentation
somewhere.
Cheers,
