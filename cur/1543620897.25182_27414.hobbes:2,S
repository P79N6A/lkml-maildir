If you are already at it, I would like to ask to you consider seriously 
the removal of the
following entries in the ide drivers /proc control files:
    ide_add_setting(drive,    "breada_readahead",    ...         1,    
2,    &read_ahead[major],        NULL);
    ide_add_setting(drive,    "file_readahead",   ...    
&max_readahead[major][minor],    NULL);
Those calls can be found in ide-cd.c, ide-disk,c and ide-floppy.c
The first does control an array of values, which doesn't make sense in 
first place. I.e. changing it doesn't
change ANY behaviour of the kernel.
The second of them is trying to control a file-system level constant 
inside the actual block device driver.
This is a blatant violation of the layering principle in software 
design, and should go as soon as
possible.
BTW.> The wole IDE /proc stuff found there makes me vommit...
Both in terms of interface and in terms of coding style.
Apparently Andre Hendrick doesn't know what ioctrl are about and is 
missing the windows
registry greatly.
