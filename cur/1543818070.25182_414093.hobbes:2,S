I had a very simple idea for doing something like this:
Assign a special semantic to GID $n: Being in group $n allows you to listen
on port $n-$offset. $offset == -1 disables this feature (default).
E.g. You want apache to listen on 80 and 443: Set $offset to 60000 and put
apache into groups 60080 and 60443.

If I'd want it to work with iptables, I'd extend the socket struct to contain
the device:inode of the corresponding application (not changing it on exec)
and stat() the allowed applications on rule setups.
(I see you choose similar but more complicated approach, but:)
I'd deliberately allow access to these sockets if it's passed to other
applications since it's the intended behaviour. (BTW: Your approach isn't
going to be 100 % reliable, since it will allow other processes to illegaly
receive data if the socket is transfered after filtering, isn't it?)
Downside of both approaches:
 You'll have to guarantee stable dev:inode pairs. NFS? umount/mount?
 Workaround: suid helper setting/deleting the allowed-rule?
