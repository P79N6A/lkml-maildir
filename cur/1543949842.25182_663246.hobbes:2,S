we _really_ must handle this differently and this _is_ a regression that 
multiple people have spent hours on bisecting already ...
So "enable CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPCRECATED" is _NOT_ the right answer, and this 
has been pointed out to you in the past.
the problem is that SYSFS_DEPRECATED changed its meaning mid-course. Now 
it means a different set of udev breakages. The correct way is to 
_RENAME_ that darn option to SYSFS_DEPRECATED_V2 (via the patch below), 
and to discontinue the user-configurability of the old SYSFS_DEPRECATED 
option. Viola, things work just fine - and the fact of SYSFS_DEPRECATED 
changing its meaning is documented as well.
this way any tester who comes over the 'make oldconfig' route is not hit 
in the head with a nasty regression ...
tested patch below. (and this is one of those rare cases where 'select' 
is the right thing to do in a Kconfig entry)

CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y changed its meaning recently and causes
regressions in working setups that had SYSFS_DEPRECATED disabled.
so rename it to SYSFS_DEPRECATED_V2 so that testers pick up the new
default via 'make oldconfig', even if their old .config's disabled
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED ...
