May I suggest to have an add-on patch which contains
- initrd-tftp
- dhcp/bootp
- other stuff for embedded systems
i.e. a unified patch.
As bootp support is likely to be killed from the kernel
in the future (and initrd-tftp wont probably accepted
not because of technical but principial reasons).
Such a patch would be useful to many people.
Richard.
