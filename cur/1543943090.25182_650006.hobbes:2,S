He has hit the BUG() here in megaraid_mbox_dpc():
                // Make sure f/w has completed a valid command
                if (scb->state != SCB_ISSUED) {
                        con_log(CL_ANN, (KERN_CRIT
                        "megaraid critical err: invalid command %d:%d:%p\n",
                                scb->sno, scb->state, scp));
                        BUG();
                        continue;       // Must never happen!
                }
