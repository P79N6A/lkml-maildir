I've had several discussions with Mark since his initial comments. Firstly
he knows his stuff. Secondly in several cases he was quite accurate on 
weaknesses in the scaling. My initial reaction was "uh humm hold on.. "
but I've since traded various bits both ways resolving misunderstandings
of models. Mark has been through at least pieces of the kernel code.
I don't agree with some of his conclusions but he's definitely not a J
Random Fool like some people think. He's also prepared to defend his claims
in detail unlike hack merchants like Fred Moody. 
I suspect we can learn useful things from his comments even if they arent
the ones you want to hear.
