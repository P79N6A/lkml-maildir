You could reorder and simplify slightly the code for handing off a UHCI
controller.  It's safer to disable PIRQD, SMI#, and legacy support first
and then turn off the interrupt enable bits, all before stopping the
controller.  You could even reset the controller rather than just stopping
it (although you might also want to avoid the 60ms delay this requires).  
Take a look at reset_hc() in drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c and see what you
think.
