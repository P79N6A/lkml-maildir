You've casted addresses to char then multiplied.
You need to divide.
Maybe it'd be better to change your sparse settings to
not print this warning rather than change normally
readable code to avoid the warning.
I like the control name "ptr-subtraction-blows".
$ make C=1 CHECKFLAGS="-Wno-ptr-subtraction-blows" drivers/char/specialix.o
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  CALL    scripts/checksyscalls.sh
  CHECK   drivers/char/specialix.c
drivers/char/specialix.c:2112:3: warning: context imbalance in 'sx_throttle' - unexpected unlock
  CC      drivers/char/specialix.o
drivers/char/specialix.c:2488: warning: ‘specialx_pci_tbl’ defined but not used
