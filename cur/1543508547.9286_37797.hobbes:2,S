Subject: Why only half support for the Panasonic LF-D101 DVD-RAM in 2.2.12?

Some kind soul included explicit support for the Panasonic DVD-RAM in
the main scsi.c driver in release 2.2.11. However, the drive is no
longer recognised as a CD-ROM.
I've been manually patching scsi.c for a while now with the following
patch, which allows the drive to function as both DVD-RAM and a CD-ROM.
I've noticed no problems with it.
I may be making a rod for my for my own back, since the programmer
appears to have referred to this patch, and may have found something
wrong with the original.
I'm quoting it here. This was from 2.2.1 so it won't work automatically.
Obviously, I'm hoping to see full support in an official release,
eventually.
Thank you.
