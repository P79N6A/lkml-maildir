Any explanation of why this solution works?
I hate to blindly just disable window_scaling, just to make tspc work on 
2.6.8.1.
Is this a bug in the tscp program, netfilter or the tcp stack (or none 
of the mentioned)? One easy conclution is that some change were made 
between 2.6.7 and 2.6.8.1 which made tspc break - The question is which 
change and what other effect this change has.
