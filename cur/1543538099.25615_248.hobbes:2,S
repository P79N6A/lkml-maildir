If they were widely used, people would use non-exec immue attacks. If you
did get a coredump, they would clean it up before you noticed.

search freshmeat for postfix.

Generally, people on this list tend to be a bit more enlightened then most
sysadmins. 
If you check the archives, I was one of the cheif participants arguing for
the Solar Designer patch when it first came out (three years ago?). Since
then it's been clearly demonstrated that the patch does little good
against an attacker thats prepaired for it (stackguard and libsafe do much
better though). 
Go get libsafe, it's got example 'sploits that work against the Solar
patch and it's alot cleaner...
