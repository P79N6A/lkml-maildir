This is the absolute last time I say this.
WAY too late. You'd better get this in before -rc1 next time around. I 
want *FIXES*ONLY* by now, and next time I see crap like this I'm going to 
ignore it until you fix me a pull that contains fixes only, and I'm not 
even going to pull during the next merge window because I'm not interested 
in merging something that isn't maintained and doesn't get those "fixes 
only" trees.
So I pulled this now, but the fact is, I already ignored this once exactly 
because it wasn't appropriate to pull at this point. Yes, I soemtimes miss 
emails, but dammit, quite often it's also because I just judge the email 
to be *CRAP* and simply not worth bothering with.
750 new lines of code, with much of it apparently being new features, and 
stupid cleanups and cosmetics that don't actually fix anything simply 
isn't "post-rc2 material". I really *really* don't want to see this again!
I'm really fed up with having to pull big changes after the merge window, 
because it just doesn't seem to let up. I'm going to go postal on the next 
maintainer who doesn't understand what "merge window" and "fixes only" 
means.
