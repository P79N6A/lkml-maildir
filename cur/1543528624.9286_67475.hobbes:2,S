Thanks to James Manning and Andrzej Krzysztof for pointing my
errors.
I also cleaned up the two paragraphs so that they are easier to
read.
Ciao!

 Processor family
 CONFIG_M386
-  This is the processor type of your CPU. This information is used for
-  optimizing purposes. In order to compile a kernel that can run on
-  all x86 CPU types (albeit not optimally fast), you can specify
-  "386" here.
+  This is the processor type of your CPU. Your safest choice is "386";
+  the kernel will then run on all x86 CPUs.  Choosing a different
+  processor type will optimize the kernel for that CPU.
 
-  If you specify one of "486" or "586" or "Pentium" or "PPro", then
-  the kernel will not necessarily run on earlier architectures (e.g. a
-  Pentium optimized kernel will run on a PPro, but not necessarily on
-  a i486).
+  Optimizing a kernel will speed up kernel operations, but will make the
+  kernel less likely to run on older CPUs.  For example:  If you choose
+  a Pentium optimized kernel, it will run on the newer Pentium Pro
+  processors, but not necessarily on the older 486 processors.
 
   Here are the settings recommended for greatest speed:
    - "386" for the AMD/Cyrix/Intel 386DX/DXL/SL/SLC/SX, Cyrix/TI
      486DLC/DLC2 and UMC 486SX-S. Only "386" kernels will run on a 386
      class machine.
-   - "486" for the AMD/Cyrix/IBM/Intel 486DX/DX2/DX4 or
+   - "486/Cx486" for the AMD/Cyrix/IBM/Intel 486DX/DX2/DX4 or
      SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2, AMD/Cyrix 5x86, NexGen Nx586 and
      UMC U5D or U5S.
-   - "586" for generic Pentium CPUs, possibly lacking the TSC 
-     (time stamp counter) register.
-   - "Pentium" for the Intel Pentium/Pentium MMX, AMD K5, K6 and 
-     K6-3D.
-   - "PPro" for the Cyrix/IBM/National Semiconductor 6x86MX, MII and
-     Intel Pentium II/Pentium Pro.
+   - "586/K5/5x86/6x86" for generic Pentium CPUs, possibly lacking TSC
+     support (time stamp counter), including the AMD K5 and other
+     generic 5x86 and 6x86 CPUs.
+   - "Pentium/TSC" for Intel Pentium/Pentium MMX with TSC support (time
+     stamp counter).
+   - "K6/II/III" for AMD K6, K6-3D, K6-II and K6-III
+   - "PPro/6x86MX" for the Cyrix/IBM/National Semiconductor 6x86MX, MII
+     and Intel Pentium II/Pentium Pro.
+   - "Athlon" for AMD Athlon.
 
   If you don't know what to do, choose "386".
