Since 2.4.19 I notice a lot of pauses with interactive work (desktop
usage). If i copy a big file over network or on local disk, some of my
desktop machines simply don't respond anymore to user requests (e.g. I
start copying a large file over nfs to local disk and start mozilla,
mozilla won't start until the copy is finished).
My current testcase is: dd if=/dev/zero of=blubber bs=4096 count=65000 and
moving the mouse during this operation. With 2.4.18 everything is ok, the
mouse runs smooth the whole time. 2.4.19 and later: I get mouse hangs, it
won't move for a second, sometimes longer. wolk reduces this problem, but
doesn't solve it.
On my servers (mostly IBM xseries 345 and 335) it's ok with a
vanilla-kernel, but there is no interactive work, mostly routing or
network monitoring.
I hope, I can run a vanilla 2.4 kernel again on my machines, at the moment
that isn't possible.
Bye,
Matthias
