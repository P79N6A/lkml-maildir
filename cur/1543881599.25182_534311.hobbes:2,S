Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Fix two boot problems related to ZONE_MOVABLE sizing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following this mail are two fixes related to a boot problem in relation
to ZONE_MOVABLE. These are fixes for memory partitioning where kernelcore=
is used and is unrelated to grouping pages by mobility.
The first patch moves kernelcore= parsing to common code. This avoids an
infinite loop that can occur when booting on IA64. As a side-effect,
it extends support of kernelcore= to all architectures that use
architecture-independent zone-sizing.
The second patch aligns ZONE_MOVABLE correctly. The bootmem allocator makes
assumptions on the alignment of zones. This can cause pages to be placed
on the freelists for the wrong zone resulting in a BUG() later. Aligning
ZONE_MOVABLE avoids the problem.
They have been successfully boot-tested with and without kernelcore=
specified on x86_64, ppc64 and IA64 (where the bug was first triggered).
