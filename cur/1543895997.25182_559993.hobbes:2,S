There is a confusing maze of special rules if one goes beyond the simple 
process address space case. There are no clean rules on how to combine 
memory policies. Refcounting / updating becomes a problem because policies 
are intended to be only updated from the process that set them up. Look at 
the gimmicks that Paul needed to do to update memory policies when a 
process is migrated and the vmas on the stack for shmem etc etc.
