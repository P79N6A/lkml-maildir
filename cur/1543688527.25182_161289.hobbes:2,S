Subject: Some read-errors on floppys not reported on 2.4.22

Given the following program:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int main()
{
    int fd;
    char buf[0x1000];
    if((fd = open("/dev/fd0", O_RDONLY)) < 0)
    {
        perror("open");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    while(read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)) > 0)
        ;
    perror("read");
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
This program will return:

# ./xxx
read: Success
# exit
exit
Script done on Fri Aug 29 12:05:51 2003
Success, even where there are lots of CRC errors that
prematurely terminate the read:
end_request: I/O error, dev 02:00 (floppy), sector 101
floppy0: data CRC error: track 2, head 1, sector 12, size 2
floppy0: data CRC error: track 2, head 1, sector 12, size 2
end_request: I/O error, dev 02:00 (floppy), sector 101
floppy0: data CRC error: track 3, head 1, sector 3, size 2
floppy0: data CRC error: track 3, head 1, sector 3, size 2
end_request: I/O error, dev 02:00 (floppy), sector 128
floppy0: data CRC error: track 2, head 1, sector 12, size 2
floppy0: data CRC error: track 2, head 1, sector 12, size 2
end_request: I/O error, dev 02:00 (floppy), sector 101
This is NotGood(tm); A program may think it got all the
data, from a floppy when, in fact it wasn't able to read
more than a few sectors.
Cheers,
