Which bugfix do you mean? If you mean the preempt fix for the NOTSC
improvement it makes no sense to split it up from the NOTSC
part. There are no other bugfixes (the reduction of the notsc window
isn't strictly a bugfix, since the feature already helped).
I can split the API change from the NOTSC feature, I'll wait some more
days in the hope this one goes in. If it doesn't go in I'll follow
your suggestion and I'll try again later with the split up in the hope
to increase my chances.
From my point of view it's not urgent to merge it, it's just the
anti-seccomp advocates that should want this patch being merged
urgently.
