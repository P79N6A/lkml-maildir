If a device later in the handler chain is also interrupting, then the
interrupt will immediately trigger again. The irq line will remain
asserted until nobody is asserting it.
If the LAST guy in the chain is the one with the interrupt, then you
basically get today's ISR "call each handler" behavior, but it should be
possible to in some cases to get less time spent in do_IRQ.
It is a trivial change to implement this behavior, but benchmarking
would have to be done to verify it really would be a worthwhile
optimization.
