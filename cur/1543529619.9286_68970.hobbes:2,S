Sorry if this is completely off topic but...
I'm trying to install Linux (RedHat 6.0) on an HP Ventra XU 6/150. When I
get past the BIOS starting stuff, it stalls only printing LI on the
screen. I've run lilo a number of times and it seems to get the correct
lilo.conf file (lilo, version 0.21). I've checked the FAQ in
/usr/doc/FAQ, it says that I might have to place the whole root directory
within the first 1023 cylinders. The / directory is on a 100M partition
and the whole disk is only 1G. The disk is SCSI. I've updated lilo to the
newest one RedHat seems to have and it didn't help.
Any clues?
