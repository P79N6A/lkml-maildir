Subject: SONY or CD-ROM lying about speed?

I have a SONY 32x CD-ROM CDU771. However, Linux reports it as 14
speed. Apparently, FreeBSD does the same.
I wonder what's the cause of this. SONY could by lying, but it sounds
a little unlikely. Alternatively, the max speed the device reports may
be wrong. Or is there some "overdrive gear" which may be invoked using
black magic?
Has anybody got ideas about this, and how to investigate?
Jon
