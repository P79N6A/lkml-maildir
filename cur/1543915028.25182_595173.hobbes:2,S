 SCSI is a generic peripheral bus (recall the expansion of the acronym).  
Even though probably the most common, storage is one of its applications 
only (think scanners for an immediately obvious other one).  I find 
describing CONFIG_SCSI as "storage support" misleading and inappropriate.
 Referring to your example it is like calling generic networking (i.e. 
CONFIG_NET) "Ethernet support".
