Hi,
  I walked through 2.3.13 patch and I have some
small questions:
  (1) __init/__exit is defined as empty string
for modules. Should be init_module/cleanup_module
marked as __init/__exit or not? Maybe question
for future modutils maintainer...
  (2) There are some large structures in kernel
which are marked as __init/__initdata because
of they are used only at device initialization.
Because of some of them are `helper' functions
used by modules too, could not we introduce
concept of swappable kernel memory? Device 
initialization occurs in specific contexts
(boottime or inside module initialization (or
cleanup, eventually)) where we could allow 
swapping. Of course, probably not for 2.4, but
just idea... For example PCI bus scan, logo
drawing code (currently unavailable for modules),
videomode databasesare such things. And
for hotpluggable devices we then cannot
release __init section in most cases (as
device initialization lives in this section
in most cases).
