I have been working in a mixed Linux/Solaris environment and this is
what works for me.  (>40 machines reading/writing/modifying the same
files at the same time for hundreds of iterations with no errors.)
- open()
  To get a file descriptor that can be locked
- fcntl(F_SETLK)
  To ensure that all other clients have written their data to the file
  and to clear the client cache
- fchmod()
  File attributes (most importantly file size) were cached when the
  file was opened, these may change between that time and when the
  lock is granted, a side effect of fchmod() is to refresh the file
  attributes from the server
- lseek() / read() / write()
  If appending, it is important to lseek(SEEK_END) at this point to
  make sure you are at the true end of file
- close()
  This will flush any data written and remove the lock
If anyone experiments with this with systems other than Linux/Solaris
I would be interested in knowing if it works there also.
