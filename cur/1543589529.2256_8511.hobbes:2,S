Subject: Question about /proc/kmsg semantics..

Two pronged:
I've seen a couple of patches in the archives to make open()/close()
on /proc/kmsg do more than NOP. As of 2.4.4, klogd still needs to
run as root since access is checked on read() rather than once at
open(). I can't find the rationale as to why they're rejected.
Also, why is reading /proc/kmsg a privileged operation, yet dmesg
can happily print out the entire ring via (do_)syslog() ?
Thanks
