The next version of my patch for root-hopping:
ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/umount-root-2.tar.gz
(Warning: extracts into the current directory !)
This one should also fix disk quota messages. I'm not sure who's looking
after disk quotas these days, but could whoever feels competent about it
please a) let me know if they find my changes acceptable, and b) maybe
even test run my patch (just triggering any over quota message should
show if it works or not).
I've also updated the documentation accordingly.
To do: upgrade to 2.3.4x, get more people to test it, remove debugging
printks, find out if this can go into 2.3, update Documentation/initrd.txt
