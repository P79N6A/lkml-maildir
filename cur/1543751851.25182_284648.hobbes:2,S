Actually, per
http://web4.moxa.com/support/download.asp#mxser.tgz
the mxser driver supports the smartio boards - and from the 1.8 mxser package 
readme.txt:
    The Smartio/Industio/UPCI family Linux driver supports following multiport
    boards.
     - 2 ports multiport board
         CP-102U, CP-102UL
         CP-132U-I, CP-132UL,
         CP-132, CP-132I, CP132S, CP-132IS,
         CI-132, CI-132I, CI-132IS,
         (C102H, C102HI, C102HIS, C102P, CP-102, CP-102S)
     - 4 ports multiport board
         CP-104UL, CP-104JU,
         CP-134U, CP-134U-I
         C104H/PCI, C104HS/PCI,
         CP-114, CP-114I, CP-114S, CP-114IS,
         C104H, C104HS,
         CI-104J, CI-104JS
         CI-134, CI-134I, CI-134IS,
         (C114HI, CT-114I, C104P)
     - 8 ports multiport board
         CP-118U
         CP-168U,
         C168H/PCI,
         C168H, C168HS,
         (C168P)
and Documentation/moxa-smartio says:
    The Smartio family Linux driver, Ver. 1.1, supports following multiport
    boards.
     -C104P/H/HS, C104H/PCI, C104HS/PCI, CI-104J 4 port multiport board.
     -C168P/H/HS, C168H/PCI 8 port multiport board.
Granted, the mxser driver supports many more boards - but it also supports the 
boards mentioned in the smartio driver.
This just means that the smartio driver needs to be marked "obsolete" if mxser is 
merged.  Not that I'm complaining - it's a bit of a mess.
