HI,
also with 2.5.7, as with 2.5.6, I have problems at boot.
I get the usual oops while initialising IDE.
my ide controller is:
00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801AA IDE (rev 02) (prog-if 80
[Master])
        Subsystem: Intel Corporation 82801AA IDE
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0
        I/O ports at 2460 [size=16]
unfortunatelly, I do not have even the time to write down oops message,
but eip is c0135068, but then I do not find a similar entry in system.map
any hint
my rootfs in reiserFS, but i do not even reach the mount ...
