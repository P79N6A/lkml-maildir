Well, lets look at a snippet of the .config:
# CONFIG_BINFMT_SOM is not set
CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT=y
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF=y
CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC=y
# CONFIG_SMP is not set
I just re-installed CML2 1.1.2, and it shows those options as you would expect,
that is the ones set to y are green, and the "not set" ones are black.  Well, except
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF which is black.  Toggling it to n and then to y makes it green.
Re-installing CML2 1.1.3, I see all those options as green.
I can send you my whole .config if that would be useful.
