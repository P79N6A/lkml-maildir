The main thing for me is that jamal/robert/ANK's work has been
undergoing research and refinement for a while now, with very promising
results combined with minimal impact on network drivers.
Any of Ingo's solutions need to be tested in a variety of situations
before we can jump on it with any confidence.
For example, although Ingo dismisses shared-irq situations as
an uninteresting case, we need to take that case into account as well,
because starvation can definitely occur.
I'm all for trying out ideas and test patches, but something as core as
hard IRQ handling needs a lot of testing and research in many different
real world situations before we use it.
So far I do not agree that there is a magic bullet...
