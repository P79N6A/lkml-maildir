Ugh. I understand the goal, but the resulting code indirection turns my
stomach a bit. 
Although do take my criticism lightly, as right off I don't have a
better suggestion other then to just yank the __init attribute from the
initialization functions. I'm just not sure the savings is worth the
added staple-gunned complexity. Might there be a better way?
