Hi,
why does this have to happen on the kernel side? Isn't it a lot easier
and better to let the userspace side of things do this work, and even
have a userspace file with the md5->version mapping? Or are there some
practical considerations that make that hard to impossible?
(I personally don't care if the file comes with the kernel, that may be
the most convenient thing, but it would be a userspace file that the
userspace side of the firmware loader uses)
