as I wrote in this mail this absolutely _does_ belong in the filesystem,
it's a major part of it and isn't easily separatable.

Oh yes, it is.  As soon as you use different access methods on an
overlapping set of objects you see exactly the problems I described.
If they don't overlap there's no point for the plugins to start with,
you'll better turn the core into a library that can be used by different
projects then.
