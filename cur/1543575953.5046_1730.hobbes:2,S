Fair enough.

The ioremap() mappings will definitely still be there - those are kernel
data structures, and the suspend/resume won't do anything to them.
I'm surprised: "yenta_init()" will re-initialize the yenta
PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_0 register, but maybe there's something wrong there. Try
adding a pci_enable_device() to turn the device on and also re-route the
interrupts if necessary.
The above is fairly strange, though. I wonder if the problem is that
0xe6000 value: that's a pretty bogus address for a PCI window, as it's in
the BIOS legacy area. 
I suspect that the suspend/resume will do something bad to the BAT
registers, which control the BIOS area mapping behaviour, and it just
kills the forwarding of the legacy region to the PCI bus, or something.
I wonder if the PCI cardbus init code should just notice this, and force
all cardbus windows to be re-initialized. That legacy area address really
doesn't look right.
