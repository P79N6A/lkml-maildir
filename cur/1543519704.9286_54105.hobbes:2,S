That's not true.  It only decreases security if you make the manual
part of the passphrase correspondingly shorter.  As an *addition*, it
increases security.  As a *replacement*, it decreases security.
However, the main reason I can see for allowing the PSN to be enabled
would be (a) asset tracking, (b) identifying a system among some set
of "dumb" nodes on an non-Ethernet network (e.g. dialin) -- this lets
all systems be cloned identically, reducing cost; (c) licensing.
Although I personally disagree with (c), if a company has a product I
want I'd rather see them make it available on Linux with a dumb
license rather than not offer it at all.
