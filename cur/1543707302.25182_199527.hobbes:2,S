Indeed.  The original name for the encoding was, in fact, "FSS-UTF",
for "filesystem safe Unicode transformation format."

No, they don't.
The first represent "..", the remaining two are illegal encodings and
do not decode to anything.
Those of us who have been involved with the issue have fought
*extremely* hard against DWIM decoders which try to decode the latter
sequences into ".." -- it's incorrect, and a security hazard.  The
only acceptable decodings is to throw an error, or use an out-of-band
encoding mechanism to denote "bad bytecode."

No, it doesn't.

UTF-8 requires the use of the shortest possible encoding.  An
application which doesn't obey that and tries to be "smart" is a
security hazard.
It is a bit unfortunate that the encoding don't exclude these by
design as opposed by error checking; it makes it a little too easy for
clueless programmers to skip :(
