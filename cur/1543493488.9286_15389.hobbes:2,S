Bugs (you may call them stupid human errors if you like, I prefer to call them
bugs) are inevitable in every code. You can't avoid them. The only thing you
can do is limit the scope of damage that can be done if they're exploited. So
bugs are very much the concern of the security system.

Please read your passage at the bottom of the mail and evaluate on how much
control over the executable would such a shell have? And if you had something
like that happen on your system (and it wasn't authorized), what intent might
that have?

Would you mind showing me how the effective set helped the security of the
system if something like what you described below happened? (If you would
like, I can give you a hint on what the first thing such a shell might do
would be)
