Well, any interaction with Windows 2k3 has to use CIFS.  SMB doesn't
work - I know, I tried smbfs first.  Of course smbclient can't really trigger
a hard lockup since it's in userspace.  I try to use it for any large
uploads I have to do, since the issue seems exclusive to the cifs
code.
NFS on the other hand, I'm not sure what issues you've seen.  I
haven't had a reproducable problem with NFS in probably ten years.
Well, at least that was Linux's fault.  I'd love it if Juniper could
explain why their VPNs are currently eating my fragmented UDP packets,
but I digress...
