No.  Please go and read it the description of the race again.  A count
gets irretrievably lost because the write operation of the first
decrement is overwritten by the second. Data gets lost.  Atomic 
operations exist to prevent that sort of thing.  You either need to use 
them or have a deep understanding of SMP read and write ordering in 
order to preserve data integrity by some equivalent algorithm.

How about like the patch below.  This throttles any block driver by
implementing a throttle metric method so that each block driver can
keep track of its own resource consumption in units of its choosing.
As an (important) example, it implements a simple metric for device
mapper devices.  Other block devices will work as before, because
they do not define any metric.  Short, sweet and untested, which is
why I have not posted it until now.
This patch originally kept its accounting info in backing_dev_info,
however that structure seems to be in some and it is just a part of
struct queue anyway, so I lifted the throttle accounting up into
struct queue.  We should be able to report on the efficacy of this
patch in terms of deadlock prevention pretty soon.
