 when I try to do a mkinitrd, I get the following message
 ******************************
 mount : the kernel does not recognize /dev/loop0 as a block device
         (maybe `insmod driver`?)
 Can't get a loopback device
 *******************************
 I'm trying to install a newer kernel. This is the only obstacle I have left
 to tackle.
 Using RedHat 6.0, upgrading kernel to 2.2.14 from 2.2.5-15
 What do I need to do to get past this.
 Thanks,
 PS : please mail me a copy, I'm not a member of the list.
