Tejun,
I checked out the kernel 2.6.19 to 2.6.20 Changelog. Seems like you
fixed a problem with the JMB363. The Asus P5B-Deluxe I am using has a
JMB363 - besides an Intel ICH8R - with the SATA ports set to AHCI as
well. Looks like that might have been the source of the problem in
2.6.19.
Thanks,
Marcus
