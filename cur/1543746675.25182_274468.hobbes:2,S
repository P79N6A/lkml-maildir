Well there was an xfs-on-raid-on-lvm stack overrun reported, but the
general problem we're addressing here is that stacking drivers can cause
arbitrary amounts of kernel stack windup.

Looks like a sensible thing to do, although it would be tidier to move the
whole thing into a separate function, no?
