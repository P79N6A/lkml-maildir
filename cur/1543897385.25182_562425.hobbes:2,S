ALSA uses quite a few tasklets in the framework and in several  
drivers.  Since we
care very much about low latency, many places use tasklet_hi_*.
It would be possible to convert to some GENERIC_SOFTIRQ mechanism, but  
then we'd
want to use a softirq that has higher priority than the 'standard' generic
softirq, similar to HI_SOFTIRQ vs. TASKLET_SOFTIRQ.
BTW: Is there a reason why HRTIMER_SOFTIRQ is the lowest-priority  
softirq instead
of being near TIMER_SOFTIRQ?

Clemens
