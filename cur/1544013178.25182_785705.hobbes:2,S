What we have so far:
  arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:742: warning: 'dmi_low_memory_corruption'
is already fixed in the git tree.
  arch/x86/mm/init_32.c:515: warning: unused variable 'pgd_base'
could be fixed with Jespers patch (which I like best).
  WARNING: modpost: Found 1 section mismatch(es).
which is (with CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y):
  WARNING: vmlinux.o(.cpuinit.data+0x0): Section mismatch in reference from
  the variable initial_code to the function .init.text:i386_start_kernel()
  The variable __cpuinitdata initial_code references a function __init
  i386_start_kernel(). If i386_start_kernel is only used by initial_code then
  annotate i386_start_kernel with a matching annotation.
was already noticed some time ago by linuxtwid...@gmail.com, but is still
unfixed.

issue which seem to point to a gcc bug.)
