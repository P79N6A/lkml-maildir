Basically with linux, and enough #ifdef's you end up with both in one.  IIUC
What would be nice is UP only drivers for initial release. Write a driver
module that says "I'm made for UP and haven't been tested with SMP/HighMEM"
so if you try to compile it with those features it would break with a
helpful error message.
What would be interesting would be SMP with support for UP.  The UP only
module would be inserted into a SMP kernel, but would only work inside one
processor, and would have source compatibility with both UP ans SMP kernels.
No non-UP locking required.
Is something like this possible?
