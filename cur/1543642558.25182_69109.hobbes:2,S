It would be really hard to fetch the oldest and highest priority message
out of several "per sender" queues. This effort is not worthwhile.
OTOH I can't see a _big_ problem when a process with sufficient 
permissions
can trash the message queues - otherwise I wonder why file permissions
are granted "per user" and not "per process".
The apps processes are designed to cooperate and trust each other for 
this.
The "application" would not work correctly if a message is not sent 
anyway.

I know this is no real argument, but: on IRIX 6.5 the POSIX mqueues are
implemented with shared mem and flocks in libc.
I have an almost working userspace implementation.
But I have another argument: speed and robustness.
I did some measurements with 32byte small messages and with 4KiB
messages, with the kernel implementation and with a userspace one:
userspace mqueue (NGPT PROCESS_SHARED MUTEX/COND)
==================================================
peewee:~/src/mqtest:>time ./uq_receive -c 99999 -q mmm >/dev/null
real    0m21.325s
user    0m9.140s
sys     0m8.340s
peewee:~/src/mqtest:>time ./uq_send -b 4092 -c 99999  mmm
real    0m21.039s
user    0m11.260s
sys     0m8.760s
kernel mqueue
==============
peewee:~/src/mqtest:>time ./mq_receive -c 99999 -q mmm >/dev/null
real    0m11.172s
user    0m0.260s
sys     0m7.130s
peewee:~/src/mqtest:>time ./mq_send -b 4092 -c 99999  mmm
real    0m10.880s
user    0m1.160s
sys     0m7.540s
The kernel one is about 2 times faster, regardless of message size!
I don't know yet where the user time is spent, I think it could be the
"slow" implementation of mutexes/condvars in NGPT.
I will retry the tests with futex-2.0 locks..
Then there are problems with the locks needed to protect the mq headers.
What happens when a signal arrives that causes the process to exit?
When I protect the calls with sigprocmask() there is even a higher
overhead in numbers of syscalls - if I don't protect, I get dangling 
locks...
I therefore vote for using mqueue in kernel and share most of the code
between SysV and POSIX mqueues.
