I'm actually not worried so much about these packets since these
drivers should be converted to skb frags as otherwise they'll
probably stop working after a while due to memory fragmentation.
But yeah for correctness we definitely should address this in
skb_splice_bits.
I still think Jarek's approach (the copying one) is probably the
easiest for now until we can find a better way.
