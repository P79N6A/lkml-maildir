You can see for youself. Police users' traffic to half of the normal rate
and here them scream :) Then change policing to shaping using wrr
(or htb class for each user), and sfq on the leafs, and users are happy.

Well, I use wrr + sfq exactly for fairness. No such thing can be
achieved with policing only.

Here it is:
                    +---------+       +-ppp0- ... - client0
                    |         +-eth1-<+-ppp1- ... - client1
Internet ----- eth0-+ router  |     . . . . . . . .
                    |         +-eth2-<  . . . . . .
                    +---------+       +-pppN- ... - clientN
		    
Traffic flows from internet to clients. 
The ethX names are for example only, my setup is more complex actually,
but that complexity is not related to IMQ or traffic shaping.
Clients use PPTP or PPPoE to connect to router.
See, there's no single interface I can attach qdisc to, if I want
to put all clients into the same qdisc.
