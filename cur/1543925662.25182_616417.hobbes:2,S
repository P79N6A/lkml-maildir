This one took a little bit longer to review and test in depth, but
i finally made it.
I really find this a really good rework, i did only a few little
very minor changes (see comments below).
Please take my comments with a big pinch of salt (as i really am very
passionate to become a kernel hacker but still lack too much knowledge
and experience in many areas).

I don't see the benefit in indirectly defining the maxminors in maxcards
and count back then. Perhaps this is cleaner/better but i just don't
understand it (now). So, i just did a additional
#define NOZOMI_MAX_CARDS (NTTY_TTY_MAXMINORS / NTTY_TTY_MINORS)
which seamed more straightforward to me and didn't break anything (as the
change to NOZOMI_MAX_PORTS currently would).
But to at least merge it a bit i removed the NTTY_TTY_MINORS alias for
MAX_PORT (and of course replaced usages with MAX_PORT).

Those changes e.g. aren't needed when just adding the one define as i
suggested above.
All other comments vanished after i studied them better :-)
I'll repost the complete patch in a few moments (in CC to Greg again).
Thanks so much for this,
Frank
