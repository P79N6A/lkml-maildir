Uh, this does not work, unfortunately in the Lisp case.
Lisp environments can produce standalone executables, which are
1. supposed to be runnable like a usual binary, without any additions
2. will suffer from the very same problem, as it merely is a
runtime bundled with the core file
(and the core file is unrelocatable)
