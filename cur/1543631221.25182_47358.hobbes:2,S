Hi,
I am trying to port User-mode-linux to Sparc64 architecture. I have the
debian(sid) on my host system with custom built 2.4.18 kernel. When I
try to generate some header file for UML that #included
<asm-sparc64/processor.h> file, I was getting parse errors for u64 data
types. When I changed all those U64 data-types to __u64 type, it fixed
the error. So, I was just wondering, whether it is the right thing to
do.
-Thanks in advance
