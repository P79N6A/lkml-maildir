Hi Ivan, Jay,
[stripped the distributor's lists from Cc: again; I just wanted the patch to
 reach lots of people that can potentially test.]

Got it, thanks!

I guess the manual will tell me how to do that ...

That's why I'm looking for something better ...
But on a generic kernel, we have to do a number of things, then:
* Detect PYXIS
* Set into PCI loopback
* Do the cross 8k DMA read
* Set flag if corruption
(And even this test is not completely perfect, as only devices on the
 primary PCI bus seem to be affected.)

Runtime detection is better of course. Think of distributors ...
On the other hand, the workaround does not hurt performance as far as I could
measure. For reading data from disk (i.e. DMAing to memory), the patch does
not do anything. For writing to disk, I make 16 or 17 PDR segments from 4,
but bonnie would not tell me any difference in performance.
So doing it on every PYXIS would also be an option.

Thanks,
