And guess what?  This patch is now in Linus kernel. Greeeeaaaattttt
stuff whoever did that.  Truely wonderful job.
Thanks for taking notice of me a month ago.  I really appreciate it.

Linus - please revert the change which caused this.
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/arm/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x9d4): In function `$a':
: undefined reference to `rd_size'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
