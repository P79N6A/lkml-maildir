The memory/bus controller usually only has a limited queue of
outstanding transactions and for a big buffer you will likely overflow
it. Also usually on modern CPUs it is enough to do prefetch for 2-3
cache lines at the beginning, then an automatic hardware prefetcher
will kick in and take care of the rest.
