                         ^^^^^^^^^^^
This IO register value (DSA = Data Struture Address) has been loaded with
some corrupted value . It should look like a valid 32 bit aligned bus
physical address pointing to main memory (assumed little-endian byte
order).
This happens from SCSI SCRIPTS at this place:
	SCR_LOAD_ABS (dsa, 4),
		PADDRH (startpos),   <--- Corrupted value loaded into DSA
	SCR_LOAD_REL (temp, 4),      <--- Instruction that faulted
		4,
}/*-------------------------< GETJOB_BEGIN >------------------*/,{
	SCR_STORE_ABS (temp, 4),
		PADDRH (startpos),
The corrupted value (from startpos) is taken from a SCRIPTS (scripth) area
that stays in main memory. This memory location gets corrupted by the 32
bit value 0x00000063 (rotated from the dump, since little-endian is
assumed).

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This just above driver complaint has never been seen since day one I care
about the ncr/sym53c8xx drivers. It only can happen if some SCRIPTS area
has been corrupted.
What part did screw up this memory and more generally memory allocated by
the driver ? this is obviously the question. As main memory is shared by
all the kernel code, there are numerous candidates (driver included,
obviously).
Since this does not look like a known problem, I cannot actually help you
a lot. Anyway, I would recommend you to first update your kernel to a
supported version. Final kernel 2.2.20 is what you likely need, it seems.
Once done, if the problem does not go away, I would recommend you to
update the driver to a more recent version. Choices are:
1) sym53c8xx-1.7.3c
2) sym-2.1.16b
Choice #2 works great and is the latest available version. It is a major
version now 2 of sym53c8xx that was version 1. It is not yet widely used
but haven't any glitch be reported (yet) by people using it.

Looks exactly same problem.

Will do.
