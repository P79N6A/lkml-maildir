        Very True , but the resolution between 3ms to 20ms varies wildly
even with SCHED_RR, for eg. for 5ms delay the one obtained is anything
between 20ms to 30ms depending on number of threads operational (more the
number of threads more is the degardation)
        but even simple linux should provide predictable delay mechanism ,
so many application require it (eg RTP Servers where packet delay is in this
range). Can We do something about this

	The low latency patches might help a little bit. It also might help to
undersleep and then busy wait the rest of the sleep once you wake up. But
the basic answer is, no, there's nothing you can do about it. Linux is not
an RTOS.
