Well I've written many programs that are hybrids of C and C++ code, many
times basically using one or the other as little more than a wrapper for the
other.  And everything works perfectly well and is perfectly maintainable,
and that made it the _right_ this to do.

They are not diverging seriously, in fact one of goals of C9x is to maintain
its current relationship to C.

These small incompatabilities, which are relatively rare when using C++ as
an enhanced C, are mostly (if not all) one way which means that with a few
fix ups (if any) the current code base should be able to be compiled with
C++ and could even maintain compatability if kept in enhanced C mode.

First of all the shifting standard was only because compiler makes started
incorporating features of the new standard before they were decided upon.
Second C is about to a standard revision of its own.

C++ is not mostly libraries, thats like saying the same of C.  You can
program a C++ program without ever using a standard C++ library/object, just
as you can do with C.

STL is not really OO and is not required to make a nice C++ OO program,
neither is the current implementation of exceptions.

There is a huge difference in the feel of using classes over structures and
their loosely associated functions.
