I'm explainign how they could be handled.   Actully I think
the other proposal (an identified structure that points to
sevear elf headers) would be more approprate.  As you point
out, if there are presently no dynamic libraries in use, it
doesn't have to be solved today.  I'm just trying to make
the code future proof, or at least a clear path forward.

Not sure what would be difficuult, and it would allow other
binary formats.   But parsing the headers in the kernel
means existing userspace doesn't have to be upgraded, so I
am not proposing this requirement.

I was thinking in terms of dyanmic libraries, and totally skipped
your comment about the relocaiton info being missing.   My reply
point was that the table could be compressed to the current
entry if all hased to the same vm area.

Regardless, its beyond the current scope.
