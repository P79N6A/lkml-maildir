take a look at your /usr/lib/gcc-lib/*/*/specs file.  the important line is:
specs:-D__ELF__ -Dunix -Di386 -D__i386__ -Dlinux -Asystem(posix)
so, yes, '#ifdef linux' will work (assuming everyone's specs file is like
mine, hee hee)

perhaps you should look in /usr/include/linux

that's what it looks like to me too.  i'm not exactly the best person to
ask, though :)

take a look at the makefiles, they're not too scary. 
from /usr/src/linux/arch/*/Makefile:
LDFLAGS=-e stext
also, /usr/src/linux/arch/*/vmlinux.lds has tonnes of cool linker stuff
finally, .*.flags (e.g. in /usr/src/linux/arch/*) might be of some help.
