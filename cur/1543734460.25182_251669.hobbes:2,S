1. I don't see spin_lock() on p->sighand->siglock in do_task_stat() 
before calling next_thread(). And the check inside next_thread() permits 
only one of the locks to be taken:
         if (!spin_is_locked(&p->sighand->siglock) &&
                                 !rwlock_is_locked(&tasklist_lock))
which is probably wrong, since tasklist_lock is always required!
2. I think the idea of checking sighand is quite obscure.
Probably it would be better to call pid_alive() for check at such places 
in proc, isn't it?
3. And yes, now I agree that this check and BUG() prevented 
next_thread() from walking through the deleted list_head in tsk->pid_list.
But I would propose to reorganize these checks in next_thread() to 
something like this:
if (!rwlock_is_locked(&tasklist_lock) || p->pids[PIDTYPE_TGID].nr == 0)
	BUG();
the last check ensures that we are still hashed and this check is more 
straithforward for understanding, agree?
4. If we do checks this way, then we can found strange proc numeric 
results. Suppose, you have read the do_task_stat() and it iterated 
through the threads and summed the times in this loop with 
next_thread(). Next, the thread dies and you can read the results w/o 
this loop and threads times, only this thread stats. Looks a bit 
invalid. Don't you think so?
Maybe we should return an error?

You patch is correct. Though I would like to hear on my previous notes 
about pid_alive().
