"slow and sucky" happens one machine at a time.  One doesn't perceive
time that is "lost" by a random machine sitting in a hut somewhere
running a bit slower.

Something like that, but not as drastic.  The effect of a marker would
be to force the compiler to preserve a statement boundary and or
preserve or recreate the values when the marker is active.  It may
interfere with the otherwise optimized code somewhat, but the amount
depends on the details.  For the most time-critical probes, we could
opt for the least powerful/disruptive markers.
