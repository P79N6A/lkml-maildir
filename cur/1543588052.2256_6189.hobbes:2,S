I have been unable to find an answer for this in the LKML archives, so I
am hoping someone on this list might perhaps have some insight or pointers
thereto on this question.
I have an embedded board with a PowerPC 405GP on which Linux 2.4.2
(MontaVista's version thereof) is running swimmingly. Attached to that
PowerPC's I2C controller is a Dallas DS1307 I2C RTC.
From the looks of drivers/char/rtc.c it would appear that this kernel
driver only supports bus-attached RTCs such as the mentioned MC146818. Is
this correct?
What is the correct access method / kernel tie-in for supporting such an
I2C-based RTC device using the "standard" interfaces?
My hope is to use 'hwclock' from util-linux w/o modification. Is this
reasonable?
Thanks,
Grant Erickson
