The situation is bad, but not that bad.
As a starter, you can compile the kernel with gcc 3.4 and run "make
checkstack" on it.  No call graph information in there, but getting
all functions on the list below 2k would help.
Next step would be a small hack to my private tool to read stack
consumption from gcc 3.4 and call graph from gcc 3.1.  Obviously you
get tons of "these five functions in the call graph are actually a
single one in the real binary".  Quick and dirty.
Then someone (doesn't have to be me) should spend some time to port
the callgraph extraction code from 3.1 to 3.4 or 4.0.  Before the
unit-at-a-time thing came up, I wanted to port things to sparse.  But
sparse would suffer from the same problem of not inlining functions
identically to the real compiler, so current gcc appears to be a
better target.
Step 1 is possible right now, step 2 might take a while (i'm on
vacation) and step 3 may not happen this year anymore, unless someone
else wants to start hacking on it.
