Is there a way in the ACPI code to do a request/release of I/O or memory
with an acpi_generic_address?  Does it even make sense to do this?
There are generic I/O routines for using a generic address, and I'm
working with an ACPI table that has a generic address, so it would seem
to make sense to have memory reservation routines through this, too.
