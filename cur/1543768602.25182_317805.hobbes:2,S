Thank you for responding Andrew!
The behavior that you describe is what I expected to see. However, with
my test program that mmap's the NFS file on the client, writes the data,
and then munmap's the file, this wasn't the case with the 2.6.9 based
kernel I was using. The file data was NEVER being written to the server.
This afternoon I downloaded and built several later kernels. I found
that with 2.6.11, the problem still occurred. With 2.6.12-rc1, the
problem did not occur. I could see the proper data on the server. 
Looking at the differences in fs/nfs between these trees I found a
change to nfs_file_release() in fs/nfs/file.c. When I applied this
change to my 2.6.9 tree, the data was written out to the server.

 }
Thanks for your help!
