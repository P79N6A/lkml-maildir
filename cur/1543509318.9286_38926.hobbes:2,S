I don't think I was implicitly relying upon magic to get it into the kernel.
Let's look at what `suitable fashion' might mean, in this context:
1) We know it can't be a .bz file, because
  
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9908_05/msg00250.html
2) We know that it can't be picked from a CVS archive, or packaged as a 
release from an archive, because
  
http://kt.linuxcare.com/kt19990819_31.html#9
3) We know that it can't be sent any time in the next two weeks, because
  
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9909_02/msg00460.html
I just don't see much there to do with the stability, cleanliness and solidity 
criteria Alan mentioned a couple of posts back.  In fact, these reasons have 
nothing to do with why people use Linux, and an N-year delay in a minor patch 
is a pretty clear sign that something's awry.
I'm reminded of when Andrew Tanenbaum discouraged Bruce Evans and me from 
working on a multi-threaded file system for Minix because it'd reduce the 
pedagogic value of Minix.
We know what happened then.

Yes, I asked.  Yes, the author has posted patches.  He's probably too polite.
