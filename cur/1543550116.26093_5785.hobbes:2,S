Code reuse is fun.  I suggest you do it the other way around though -
write
a driver in plain C for both linux and windows.
C++ for linux may be possible, if you do the job of making C++
work with kernel code yourself.  Most others don't want it, can't be 
convinced, and certainly won't help you with it.  If this is too
much - port your driver to C.
