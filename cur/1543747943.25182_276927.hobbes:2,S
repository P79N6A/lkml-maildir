Hi Rene,
Could you please send me "pnp.tar" from something like this:
mkdir /tmp/pnp; cp /proc/bus/pnp/[0-f][0-f] /tmp/pnp; tar -cf pnp.tar /tmp/pnp; rm -fR /tmp/pnp
make sure the pnpbios /proc interface is compiled into the kernel.
I'd like to look at the node data to see what's going on.
Thanks,
Adam
