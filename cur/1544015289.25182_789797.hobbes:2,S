Well, in that case you'll have to do byte PIO for all ATAPI devices,
because this is an expected device to host transfer length.

Yes it was, look at the debugging info:

That's a single element sg list with a 96 byte buffer.  That's precisely
what SCSI sets up to receive incoming sense data.  There's basically no
setup commands which are multiple element because the sg list is set up
on a kmalloc'd buffer.
The problem is that bytes is 18 and that comes from this:
	ap->ops->sff_tf_read(ap, &qc->result_tf);
	ireason = qc->result_tf.nsect;
	bc_lo = qc->result_tf.lbam;
	bc_hi = qc->result_tf.lbah;
	bytes = (bc_hi << 8) | bc_lo;
So we're asking the device how much data it wants to transfer. It said
18 bytes.  There's nothing padding or aligning in block can do about
this.

It is.  The receive buffer is 96 bytes.  It will be page aligned and 96
is divisible by 4.

The block layer does do pad buffers, but in this case there was no need
of one.
