this only lets you get RUSAGE_SELF data for the target... for many 
processes it's more important to get the RUSAGE_CHILDREN data... and 
really i'm having a hard time imagining a use for this code which on 
further inspection doesn't eventually blow up to the requirements of a 
proper accounting subsystem... (of which i understand there are two or 
three competining implementations in progress?)
do you have a use case for this new code?
