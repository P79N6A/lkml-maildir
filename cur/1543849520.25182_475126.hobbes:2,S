Subject: futex hang with rpm in 2.6.17.1-2174_FC5

I had a dead nfs server that was causing some programs to pause,
in particular 'yum install foo' was paused.  I kill -9'd the
yum related processes.
I fixed up the nfs server and was able to un-mount the file system.
I subsequently killed many backed up updatedb and similar processes.
Now, there are no rpm processes, but if I try 'rpm [anything]' it
hangs trying to open a futex:
open("/var/lib/rpm/Packages", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 4
fcntl64(4, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)         = 0
fstat64(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=41390080, ...}) = 0
futex(0xb7ba178c, FUTEX_WAIT, 1, NULL <unfinished ...>
Is there any way to figure out what is causing this futex-wait?
Thanks,
Ben
