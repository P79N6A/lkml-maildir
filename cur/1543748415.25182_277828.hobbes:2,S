Looked again, you are right, looks like a 2.4 only problem and even there I
am darned if I can see how it leaks now, still digging as to where it is coming
from. I have a box which goes negative shortly after bootup, this seems to put
it in a feedback loop and  it just keeps heading south from there pushing on the
dcache. This is running on a fedora legacy kernel for redhat 9.0 which I added
kdb to. Starting to wonder if the compiler screwed up somewhere. I have an
external fiberchannel driver loaded, but it does not have any dentry related
code in it.
