Well yeah, that sounded very improbable to begin with. But then again, there
were very few things that could've done it apart from kernel early boot/late
shutdown code, bios and cosmic radiation.

Yes, that's certainly the most sensible thing to do.
Although it did happen with both 2.2 and 2.4 (never tried 2.6
unfortunately), but only on a single box, and I never heard of anybody else
seeing anything similar, so it can't be a wide spread problem even it still
were present.
