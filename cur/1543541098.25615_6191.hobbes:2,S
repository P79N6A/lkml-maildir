We're working on 2MB RAM and 4MB flash - it's a real h/w -,
and dreaming linux on 1MB RAM and 2MB flash.
(our customer also wants, in my humble opinion we can't. ;-))
They said that next h/w has more memories, but no MMU.
because of lacking memory,
we need binfmt like XIP(eXecution In Place).
but, it's seems not to be exists. :(
linux kernel has some minor abilities on such tiny h/w.
but, I and my friends used to say "linux on vending machine".
