When I load the module cpia_usb dmesg shows:
cpia_usb: Unknown symbol cpia_register_camera
cpia_usb: Unknown symbol cpia_unregister_camera
Normally this would be no problem, I could fix that; BUT
1. cpia.c does export both these methods, in fact they are
the only two exported.
2. more peculiar still - cpia_usb then successfully calls
cpia_register_camera, the camera is registered according
to dmesg, /proc/bus/usb/devices, /proc/cpia /proc/video/dev.
And the camera works just fine!  So why the error?
Am I missing something here?
