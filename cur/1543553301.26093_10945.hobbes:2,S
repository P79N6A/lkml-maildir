Gary,
Your post to the kernel mailing list is annoyingly patronizing, and _will_
get you flamed and added to kill files as a result.  On the other hand
working on kernel documentation is a worthy endeavor, so I would encourage
you to try an approach which shows some respect to the people who make it
all possible.  To get the best, and most useful results I suggest browsing
the docs directory in the latest source tree.  Then attempt to come up with
a structural model for describing the feature of the kernel to the best of
your ability.  Finally, post intelligent requests to flesh out the kernel
documentation framework.  An intelligent request might look like, "What is
the best way to manage event requests in the Linux kernel (version 2.2, 2.4,
2.6)?", or "In what way are Linux threads different from POSIX threads (2.2,
2.4, 2.6)?", or "How do hook in a new filesystem to the Linux kernel (2.2,
2.4, 2.6)?", or "What SMP considerations need to be made in network device
drivers?".  By contrast your current approach is too annoying to accomplish
much useful.
