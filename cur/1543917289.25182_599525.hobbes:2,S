Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[PATCH] Some IO scheduler cleanup in Documentation/block
as-iosched.txt:
  o  Changed IO scheduler selection text to a reference to the
     switching-sched.txt file.
  o  Fixed typo: 'for up time...' -> 'for up to...'
  o  Added short description of the est_time file.
deadline-iosched.txt:
  o  Changed IO scheduler selection text to a reference to the
     switching-sched.txt file.
  o  Removed references to non-existent seek-cost and stream_unit.
  o  Fixed typo: 'write_starved' -> 'writes_starved'
switching-sched.txt:
  o  Added in boot-time argument to set the default IO scheduler. (From
     as-iosched.txt)
  o  Added in sysfs mount instructions. (From deadline-iosched.txt)
