Subject: [PATCH] Makefiles are not built using a Fortran compiler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/7/273

David Holland pointed out that Make has a lot of implicit suffix rules
built in and you can disable them by setting ".SUFFIXES:".  As an
example, checking the debugging information shows we no longer try to
compile anything from a '.f' suffix.  This turns out to be good for a 15%
speedup on a build with nothing to do; down from 29.1 seconds to 24.7
seconds on my K6.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
