First of all, I don't like my parser anymore so I hope you don't back
out, Paul.  Perhaps all that is needed to make your parser acceptable
to Andrew is 1) tweak it to use bitmap_shift_right / set_bit, and 2)
use nbits in the interface but immediately convert it to the nbytes that
the algorithm actually wants.
Over the weekend, I may poke at my version and look over yours again
and perhaps yet a third version will come out of this.  Which is a good
thing since lots of choices to pick and merge from is what is best for
Andrew and for Linux.
Joe
