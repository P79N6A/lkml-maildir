Hm.  In the case discussed above we have a task that's right before calling
frozen_process(), so we can't thaw it, because it's not frozen.  It will be
frozen just in a while, but try_to_freeze_tasks() and thaw_tasks() have no
way to check this.
I think to close this race the refrigerator should check TIF_FREEZE and set
PF_FROZEN _and_ reset TIF_FREEZE under a lock that would also have to be
taken by try_to_freeze_tasks() in the beginning of the error path.  This will
ensure that all tasks either freeze themselves before the error path in
try_to_freeze_tasks() is executed, or remain unfrozen.
I'll try to prepare a patch to illustrate this, but right now I'm too tired to
do it. :-)

Yes, at first sight it looks good.
BTW, what do you think of the updated patch I sent two messages ago?
