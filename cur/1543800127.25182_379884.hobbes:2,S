it will, the inline hint only affects the thresholds so it's not
entirely without effects, but I can imagine that there are cases that
truely are performance critical and can be optimized out and where you
don't want to help gcc a bit (say a one line wrapper around readl or
writel). Otoh I suspect that modern gcc will be more than smart enough
and inline one liners anyway (if they're static of course).
