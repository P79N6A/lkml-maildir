Sure,
Userspace tracing is :
- A userspace process wants to record information to a circular ring
  buffer. This information has a timestamp. It should disrupt the
  timings minimally. The timestamps must be synchronized with the
  timestamps given to the kernel trace events so we can analyze all the
  information together.
- When one subbuffer of the ring buffer is filled, the information is
  ready to be read by a "trace dumping" process and sent to disk or to
  the network. At this point, the traced process raises a flag that will
  be checked periodically by the OS to wake up the disk/network dumper
  daemon. (for future reference, I use the term "buffer writer" when I
  talk about the traced process and the term "buffer reader" when
  talking about the disk/network dumper daemon).
There is more information in the email I sent to Frank Eigler. Please
feel free to ask for more if I am not clear about specific points.
A lot of the background information is already explained in the kernel
tracing paper I presented at OLS2006, it might be a good start :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/papers/desnoyers-ols2006.pdf
Another requirement I am trying to meet is protection of tracing buffers
against corruption coming from other userspace process. K42 implemented
their tracing buffers shared system-wide : with the OS too. The
processes have full access to the kernel buffers and can therefore
corrupt the whole system's trace. This is something I would like not to
allow.
