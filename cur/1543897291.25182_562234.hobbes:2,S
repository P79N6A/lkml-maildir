Yes, for example one could sign Java's classfiles and employ a special trusted
Java VM which checks the signatures before execution. Also, this is a more
general case of signing kernel modules (as you mentioned below). There are
really numerous applications one could imagine, we just don't really know which
ones are practical. We definitely appreciate further ideas on this.
Also the signature-in-ELF can be used complementary to our approach: for
example NFS is currently unable to handle real extended attributes (nfs does
only posix acls). So for binaries delivered over NFS our approach wouldn't
work.

Correct up to here.

Nope. I unluckily wrote 'userspace' where I should have said something else:
Chain-of-trust is handled in what I would label 'Adminspace' (Where we do the
signing as in points 1 and 2). There is a very small number of signatures (in
our example one) known to the kernel and only those are trusted, and those are
applied to the binaries by the administrator in your point 2. The kernel does
and should never rely on userspace to tell it which signatures are trustworthy.
Only the administrator may do so by means of the signatures directly compiled
into the kernel.
So in short: Chain-of-trust is handled by the administrator in his secure
central location.

We do not trust any userspace application, see above.

We focus on attacks where an attacker may alter some executable file, for
example by altering a mounted nfs-share, manipulating disk-content by simply
pulling a disk, mounting it and writing to it, etc.
This relies on the kernel beeing trustworthy of course, so one would need to
take special measures to protect the kernel-image from beeing similarly
altered. One (somewhat not-so-secure method) would be supplying kernel images
by PXE and forbidding local booting, another measure would be using a TPM
and an appropriate bootloader to check the kernel for unwanted modifications.

We already thought about that. Using some existing code is definitely preferable
to inventing DSA again :)
