Because then 5 objects will fit into one 8 kB memory block:
5*1620+slab control structure.

>(32bit): 1514b + 2b + 16b + 160b = 1692b
>(64bit): 1514b + 2b + 16b + 312b = 1844b

Hmm. If the shared_info is that large then the patch won't help much.
Alan - what is printed in the /proc/slabinfo line for the new cache?
- 1620 bytes is probably a bit too much for archs with 128 byte cache 
lines and 8 kB pages. If I've calculated correctly, only 4 will fit into 
one page.
- if the shared info is really that large - is the patch actually useful?
