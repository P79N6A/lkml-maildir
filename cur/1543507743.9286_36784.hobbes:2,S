     I ended up going back to 2.2.10, 2.2.12 seems to have a memory leak
similiar to the TCP memory leak in 2.2.11 that existed without the TCP memory
leak patch.
     With Dave Miller's patch to the Sparc assembly applied, with or without
Andrea's schedualer patch, what I see is a huge amount of memory get allocated
to buffers (on the order of 155mb), and then as cache grows, things go into
swap, and then eventually the machine runs out of swap and dies.
     The behavior is sporadic, sometimes the machines will go hours and then
boom it happens in a few minutes.  I don't know what triggers it but this is
very similiar to what I saw with 2.2.11. 
     I wouldn't kill, but perhaps maim a few individuals for a good stable
linux kernel on Sparc SMP...
