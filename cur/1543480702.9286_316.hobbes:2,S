I'm somewhat confused by this fourth draft.  Are we writing a 
press release or a newspaper/-magazine article?  If it's a
press release leave the quotes out.  If we want to give 
journalists the quotes, let's just include pointers to the 
documents.  Put them into the section with the links at the end 
under 'Further readings.'
The processors part is okay, it's just confusing to mention 
every architectures.
Regards, Robert
