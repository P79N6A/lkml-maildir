Ok, but it is a very specialized situation not applicable to most
others. I just say this for all the other people following the thread.
Again most workloads are not that gtod intensive.
BTW if you don't use powernow and don't use blades with thermal clock ramping 
and use idle=poll then the TSCs should be synchronized on AMD dual core
and TSC gtod can be used. But it will burn a lot of power and make the system 
run very hot.

Ah you mean you forced the kernel to use a unsynchronized TSC 
for gtod during your tuning attempts and then discovered that it didn't work?
Call me surprised.
In the default configuration there shouldn't be any problems
like this, it will just run slower because the kernel falls back to a slower
time source.

Last time I checked Dual core Opterons weren't marketed to gamers.

Lots of various parties are to blame here, not just AMD.
The BIOS vendors for not exposing HPET even when it is available in the 
hardware. While HPET is slower than TSC too it definitely isn't nearly as 
slow as pmtimer.
Possibly the Linux people for not getting per CPU TSC going quicker.
The writers of software who uses gtod too often or force the kernel
to call it for each packet by carelessly using the timestamp ioctl.
