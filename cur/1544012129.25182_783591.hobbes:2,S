Why bail out this late?  We can save the other stuff in exit_mmap() as
well if we have no mmaps.
Granted, the path is dead cold so the extra call overhead doesn't
matter but I think the check is logically better placed in
exit_mmap().

Subject: mm: check for no mmaps in exit_mmap()
When dup_mmap() ooms we can end up with mm->mmap == NULL.  The error
path does mmput() and unmap_vmas() gets a NULL vma which it
dereferences.
In exit_mmap() there is nothing to do at all for this case, we can
cancel the callpath right there.
