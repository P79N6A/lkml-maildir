What? Explain why a memory-mapped buffer can't be DMAed directly?

You apparently didn't even bother to read my explanation why the
copy/to/from user was necessary unless the buffer(s) were memory-
mapped, marked reserved, and set to no-cache. In that case
you can DMA directly to/from user-space. Perhaps you just wanted
to argue?

Again, as long as you can guarantee that the RAM you are using
is reserved so the kernel won't use it for paged RAM, and as
long as it's accessible in both user-mode and kernel-mode,
which means memory-mapped, either the kernel or the user can
use it as it sees fit. If it can't, the kernel is buggy. In
fact, there is no way the kernel could prevent it from being
used in this manner. Since, by definition, the kernel
will leave reserved memory alone, and memory-mapped space
will not fault, there is no way for the kernel to even know
how it is being accessed.
