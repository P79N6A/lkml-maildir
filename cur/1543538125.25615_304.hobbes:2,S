If you could build utf8 conversion table for me to use it in place of
iocharset and/or codepage, I'll be very happy to test multibyte encodings,
but it is a bit complicated to verify them without real world examples...

I'll test it ASAP. But tomorrow evening I'm leaving Prague and I'll
have only 28k8 modem access until next monday...
