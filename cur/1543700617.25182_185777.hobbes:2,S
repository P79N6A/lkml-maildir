Hi!
When I try to boot an SMP kernel on an Dual Xeon system
(Asus PR-DLS533 motherboard) with option "nosmp", the
Fusion MPT driver does not work anymore: It prints a startup
message, can't find any device on the SCSI bus and keeps
resetting the bus on and on.
Messages look something like this (copied from memory by hand,
as the system obviously can't write logfiles to the disk... ;-):
[...]
Fusion MPT base driver 2.05.05+

I verified this behaviour with linux 2.4.23 and 2.4.24-pre2
and Fusion MPT drivers 2.05.05+ (original) and 2.05.10 (patched)
