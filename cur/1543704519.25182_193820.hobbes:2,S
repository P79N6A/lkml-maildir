Linux caches disk data on a per-file basis.  So if you preload pagecache
via the /dev/hda1 "file", that is of no benefit to the /etc/passwd file. 
Each one has its own unique pagecache.  When reading pages for /etc/passwd
we don't go looking for the same disk blocks in the cache of /dev/hda1.
Which is why the userspace cache preloading needs to know the pathnames of
all the relevant files - it needs to open and read each one, applying
knowledge of disk layout while doing it.
