This is the reason I went with using distinct filesystems to perform the 
triggers.  If we use follow_link logic, we will have a reference to the 
respective vfsmount.  Dentry's themselves know nothing about the 
triggers, as the triggers just look like a mounted filesystem.   The 
vfsmount information has enough information for autofs to call a 
userspace agent through hotplug and have userspace handle the mount.  In 
effect, there is no daemon so nobody 'owns' a trigger in the same sense 
as with autofs3/4.
As far as userspace is concerned, an autofs filesystem is mounted as is 
any other filesystem.  All that is required is a proper set of mount 
options.  For example, mounting auto_home on /home is:
mount -t autofs -o maptype=indirect,mapname=auto_home auto_home /home
Whenever somebody traverses into a subdir in /home within any namespace 
this autofs filesystem has been inherited, userspace is invoked (in that 
namespace) to perform the mount.  Again, there is no 'ownership' other 
than maybe calling the namespace it resides it the 'owner', as you would 
for any other mountpoint.
