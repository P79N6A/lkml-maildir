I think you should mention:
USB and FireWire - possibly appealing to the multimedia market, etc? Note
the high proliferation of USB Zip drives, etc, so you could tout this as how
it's great that we've got all the k-whrad standards.
Netfilter - I think I mention this to everyone I talk to about Linux 2.4.
Stateful inspection, totally extensible, separate conntrack/NAT ... what more
can I say? (apart from a cool maintainer </suck-up>)
um, and that's about it!
Be well :)

> Hello,

> I'm not sure if this has been discussed yet, I'm not completely caught up wit
h the current kernel list. However with the pending release of Linux 2.4, it ma
y be time to bring this up again.

> I've created a rough draft (intended for discussion only!) of a press release
 for Linux 2.4, if we decide to go with one. Greg Smart and Albert Cahalan atte
mpted this for Linux 2.2 but I don't think anything came of that work -- now I'
ve decided to step up and make a fool of myself for Linux 2.4. :)

omeone on this list who actually knows what to do with a press release, it's qu
ite a bit beyond my experience. Feel free to edit this as appropiate.

r a final version, we would want to point that at a good resource for more info
rmation about the release-- I'm a bit biased in this respect.

> The Internet, August XX, 2000
> 
> Linus Torvalds and the kernel development team would like to announce the imm
ediate availability of Linux 2.4, the latest revision of the popular open sourc
e operating system kernel. This update brings increased scalability and perform
ance to all Linux users, in addition to new hardware support. 
> 
> Notewothy Features:
> 
> -> Enterprise Ready! Linux 2.4 includes changes that make it even more ready 
for Enterprise environments. This new revision supports up to 64 gigabytes of R
AM, allows files to be larger than 2 gigabytes, supports many more simultaneous
 processes, and has been largely rewritten to take better advantage of systems 
with multiple processors.
> 
> -> Cutting-edge hardware support. Linux now supports Itanium, the 64-bit Inte
l hardware soon to be released as well as the S/390, an IBM mainframe, and Supe
rH, often used in WindowsCE handhelds. Linux 2.4 improves support for Intel and
 Apple desktop and server hardware, in addition to Compaq servers based on the 
Alpha processor, Sun Sparc systems, MIPs systems, and other platforms.
> 
> -> Linux is now even better suited for desktop environments with a  new resou
rce manager and support for USB and Firewire hardware. Additionally, Linux 2.4 
also improves support for PC Cards (PCMCIA) and legacy "Plug-and-Play" cards.
> 
> -> Rewritten network layer to be faster than ever before, especially on multi
processor hardware. This new layer brings to Linux the flexibility and power fo
rmerly available only with expensive routing hardware.
> 
> -> Support for version 3 of the popular NFS filesystem for sharing files in U
NIX-like environments.
> 
> -> Linux 2.4 includes special enhancments for webservers including a kernel-l
evel web server and "wake one" support for speedier page serving with all popul
ar web servers, including Apache.
> 
> -> Logical Volume Manager for easy administration of disk space, including ad
ding, deleting, and resizing disk slices on the fly.
> 
> This update is already available to advanced users through multiple kernel mi
rrors (ftp.kernel.org) Although no timeframes have been announced at this time,
 all current Linux distributors will be updating to this version of the kernel 
within the next several months. 
> 
> Linux is developed by a online team of programmers headed by Linus Torvalds, 
a resident of Santa Clara, CA. Linux has been developed using the open source m
ethodology which provides for source code and peer review at all stages of deve
lopment. It is because of this system of openness that Linux has grown to be th
e most successful non-corporate operating system to date.
