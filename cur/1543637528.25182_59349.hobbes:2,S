So then is that not opposite of what modversion says it does, which is 
to allow modules to be more comptible across multiple kernel versions?
Basically, the problem is that if module.h is included and MODVERSION is 
not defined, and the module wants to export symbols (EXPORT_SYMTAB is 
defined), then module.h automatically ifdefs modversions.h even if the 
kernel is not configured to use it (and thus the file does not exist).
