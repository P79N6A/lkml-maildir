This breaks because hdr.cmdp is a pointer, not an array.
I think there has to be a hdr.mx_sb_len = sizeof(struct request_sense) in 
there too?
Also, this changes the semantics of CDROM_SEND_PACKET, currently if 
the command fails, it returns EIO, after the patch it succeeds.
how's this incremental patch?  It seems to work as I expect it to.
