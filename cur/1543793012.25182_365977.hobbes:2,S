ah, i see - you changed __delay to always be loop-based. That is quite 
incorrect.
but i think there is a generic way to solve this: just busy-poll 
->read_cycles(). I.e. move __delay into the generic code too. This means 
even more architecture-specific code would be consolidated, which is 
always good.
