-O3 activates -finline-functions:
`-finline-functions'
     Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
     heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
     integrating in this way.
     If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
     is declared `static', then the function is normally not output as
     assembler code in its own right.
Last paragraph is the key. Perhaps previous gcc'd did not all his work
as the manual says (ie, did not kill the non-inline version, bug),
but people has got used to the bug, and see it as a feature.
