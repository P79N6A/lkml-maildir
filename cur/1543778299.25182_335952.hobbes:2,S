a reason for what ? the fact that the notebook performs faster than the
desktop while slower on I/O ?

Your Notebook's P4 has HT enabled (50% apparent idle remain permanently during
operation). But you'll note that your load is 60% system + 40% user there, and
that you do absolutely no I/O (I presume it's the second run and it's cached).

This one's hyperthreaded too (apparent consumption never goes above 50%).
However, while not doing any I/O either, you're always spending only 4% in
user and 96% in system. This means that it might take 10x more time to
complete the same operations, had it been user-cpu bound. And this is about
what you observe.
There clearly is a problem on the system installed on this machine. You should
use strace to see what this machine does all the time, it is absolutely not
expected that the user/system ratios change so much between two nearly
identical systems. So there are system calls which eat all CPU. You may want
to try strace -Tttt on the running process during a few tens of seconds. I
guess you'll immediately find the culprit amongst the syscalls, and it might
give you a clue.
