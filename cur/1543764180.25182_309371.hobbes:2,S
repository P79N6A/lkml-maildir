Ok, I've narrowed the problem down to one patch. In 2.6.11-mm3, the
problem goes away if I remove this patch:
swsusp-enable-resume-from-initrd.patch
(Recap of the problem in case this gets forwarded: Resume is almost
instant without the apparently-guilty patch. With the patch, resume
takes almost half an hour.)
BTW, there's another strange thing that's introduced by 2.6.11-rc2-mm1:
With that kernel, suspend is also ridiculously slow (speed is comparable
to the slow resume with the aforementioned patch). 2.6.11-rc2 does not
have that problem.
Also, with 2.6.12-rc2-mm1, this computer happens to hit the bug where
all the printk timestamps are 0000000.0000000 (don't take the # of
digits too literally). Probably unrelated, but I may as well mention it.
(System is an Athlon XP 2200+ with SiS chipset. I can't remember which
model of SiS chipset.)
