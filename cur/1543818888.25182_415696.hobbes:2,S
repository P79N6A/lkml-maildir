Ok, In such a case we should first
#define NEW_IMPROVED_HLIST_FOR_EACH_ENTRY_RCU_WHICH_DOESNT_NEED_EXTRA_PARM(pos, head, member)	\
	for (pos = hlist_entry((head)->first, typeof(*(pos)), member);			\
		rcu_dereference(pos) != hlist_entry(NULL, typeof(*(pos)), member)	\
			&& ({ prefetch((pos)->member.next); 1; });			\
		(pos) = hlist_entry((pos)->member.next, typeof(*(pos)), member))
What do you think? What should be the name for it?
Oleg.
