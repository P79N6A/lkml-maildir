Ah, right. Thanks for your analysis! Never ran into this condition as on the
Geode systems I had the IRQ is shared between UDC and UOC/OTG
(both on the CS5536 chip) and UOC never fires interrupts while UDC
driver is loaded as both drivers (UOC/OTG driver is not in the kernel yet)
register each other which makes sure that interrupts are enabled
after  udc_pci_probe().

I could provide a fix within the next weeks. Currently I move to another 
company and
have no hardware to test it.
Maybe you want to try this. It should work to place the register init 
from udc_probe()
/* udc csr registers base */
dev->csr = dev->virt_addr + UDC_CSR_ADDR;
/* dev registers base */
dev->regs = dev->virt_addr + UDC_DEVCFG_ADDR;
/* ep registers base */
dev->ep_regs = dev->virt_addr + UDC_EPREGS_ADDR;
/* fifo's base */
dev->rxfifo = (u32 __iomem *)(dev->virt_addr + UDC_RXFIFO_ADDR);
dev->txfifo = (u32 __iomem *)(dev->virt_addr + UDC_TXFIFO_ADDR);
just before request_irq(...) to allow the interrupt handler to read the 
interrupt status
registers.
