Did you ever get a motivation on why they want to pass it from the boot
loader? It sounds like a particularly bad idea to me.
We can't allocate memory in the tagged list parser so you need to have
it statically allocated in the kernel. That means that there is a
maximum number of partitions, or that we're wasting memory if we don't
use all partition table entries. This can of course be (partly) solved
by putting the partition table in the __initdata section, but in that
case you can't use the partition data if you have the MTD subsystem as
modules.
I wonder what was wrong with the previous solution where the kernel
just read the partition table directly from flash? If the bootloader
can read the partition table, why can't the kernel?
