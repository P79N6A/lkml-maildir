Ouch... Yes, we can do that, but... Is it really worth the trouble? Let's
see: it will move the 'sector-skipping' code from error path to the main
one (modulo names of fields) and will leave us with the things we are
already doing in the 99% of drivers. Who else (aside of end_request())
needs to know ->sector of request under IO?
