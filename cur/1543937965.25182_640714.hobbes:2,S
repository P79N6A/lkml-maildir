oprofile already supports logging the pid I believe. Otherwise
the pid filter in opreport could hardly work.

oprofile works fine for modules.

Well rather it uses an existing framework for something that fits
it well.
Also the way I proposed is very cheap and would be possible
to use in production kernels without special configs.

The oprofile interface is per CPU (so you wouldn't need to reinvent
that to fix your locking) and if you add the syscall
logging feature to it it would apply to all profile events
e.g. you could then do things like "matching cache misses to syscalls"
