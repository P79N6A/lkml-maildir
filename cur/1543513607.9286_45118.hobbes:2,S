Yes I saw this. The bttv code needs the main memory subsystem to support
a kmalloc/getfreepage below 4Gig. The rest of it looks fairly easy to fix.
The Zoran driver has a similar problem, coupled with the fact it wants updating
to the bttv style capture code (bttv has been rejigged to work right on
Ultrasparc etc by DaveM so is a more portable code set)
(Bounce buffers are out here. You can't bounce buffer the TV capture feed)
