If everybody did this Linus would get 1001 unnecessary changes for 1002
patches...
Look, this isn't 2.5.   Everyone else has to separate out their 2.5
patches.  You're not special, you need to do it too...  Let's actually
take another half-second when sending patches to make sure Linus only
gets the changes destined for 2.4.  Keep the patch noise down, and help
out not only Linus but everyone else reviewing 2.4 code.
