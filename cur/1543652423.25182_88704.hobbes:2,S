   Thanks for shedding light on that; but I'm still wondering if there
   might be data loss if userspace modifies the page in the tiny window
   between correctly positioned flush_cache_page and pte invalidation?
The flush merely writes back the data, a copy-back operation, fully L2
cache coherent.  All cpus will see correct data if an intermittant
store occurs.
