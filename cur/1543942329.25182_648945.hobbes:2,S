Seriously, I do agree with you on that.  It seems like the excitement
of making great changes has overtaken proper caution here.
Though I guess it was just coincidence that made it more debuggable
in my -mm kernel (which gave "bad pgd" errors after starting X), when
the -git kernel just crashed somehow in starting X.  And I was lucky
to have CONFIG_VMSPLIT_2G_OPT on that machine, which placed the
corruption somewhere that soon got noticed.
