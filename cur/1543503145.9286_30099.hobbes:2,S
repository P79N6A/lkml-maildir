With sigqueueinfo: 
	new_tid = clone(...)
	sigwaitinfo( ..., &info ) 
	if (info.si_errno) { 
		...
	}
	return;
thread:
	info.si_errno =  sched_setscheduler(getpid(), ...) 
	sigqueueinfo(parent, &info); 
Which is two context switches, where one is "hidden" (the thread has not to
wait for the parent to run, so it can happily complete its time share). With
CLONE_SUSPEND the same hidden context switch is there too (you have to 
switch back to the parent sooner or later to process the return of pthread_create)
Also with the lazy tlb flushing 2.3 has now a context switch between threads that
share VM is not much more than a function call now. And system calls itself are
rather cheap in Linux, forget the old Solaris think where they are very expensive :)
