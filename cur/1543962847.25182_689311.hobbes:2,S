You as (or having the ear of) a subsystem maintainer can make that
judgement.  If your marker is more of a low-level field diagnostic
sort of thing, feel free to pass the most appropriate values - even
binary dumps of things.  An end user will not normally attach to those
markers.

I hope not -- this embedded-C stuff should only be necessary if we
need to compensate for the data-stingyness of the marker.  See just
below that on the wiki page for a more generous marker.

Actually, systemtap will have consumed the format strings by then
(during script translate time), in order to figure out the types of
$argN.

Systemtap doesn't *need* markers in the sense of it being an essential
prerequisite.  But it is beneficial to have them around, in order to:
- suffer only a small fraction of kprobes dispatching overhead
- pass pretty arbitrary parameters without relying on much compiler
  cooperation, and specifically without requiring debugging info
