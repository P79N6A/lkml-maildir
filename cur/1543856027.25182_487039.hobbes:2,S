How does this patch achieve that? All this patch does is not detecting the
sibling topology. Kernel will still use all the threads and it just
forgoes the intelligence of which cpus are thread and core siblings and
thus disables the optimizations done by scheduler and doesn't export the
cpu topology to the user through sysfs and /proc.
Am I missing the point of this patch?
thanks,
