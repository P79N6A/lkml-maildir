Thanks for the clarification.

I would strongly prefer that such documentation of older restrictions be
moved to the NOTES section of mkswap(8). The set of users who :
o are using util-linux 2.12+
o are using pre-2.4 kernels
o will read the mkswap(8) man page
o will not read such a NOTES section
seems relatively small to me when compared to the number of users
confused by the text (including the admin who originally brought this
up, was under the impression the limit still applied generally due to
the man page, and has also been told so by Red Hat support).
regards,
john
