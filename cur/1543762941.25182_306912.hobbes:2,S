We've been through this before.  It's not a question of trusting the
hardware to be /dev/hw_random, it's a question of trusting it to be
/dev/random.
/dev/random is special in that we've gone to extraordinary lengths to
make sure that it contains the amount of entropy that we say it does.
So while it'd be perfectly OK to feed unverified data through
/dev/hw_random, the same cannot be done for /dev/random.
