Yes, TCP provides a reliable point-to-point path, and UDP doesn't. The 
problem is considering where does this unreliability starts in the UDP 
path. In Alan's opinion (I think) it starts in the very moment data is 
passed to the call to sendto() (i.e, includes the kernel in the 
unreliable UDP path). Perhaps it is a little sad to see the kernel as 
something lossy, but I think it's the nature of UDP.
