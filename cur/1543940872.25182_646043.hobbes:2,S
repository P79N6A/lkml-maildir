Well a pure 2.6.24 version compiled with CONFIG_SMP=n booted just fine, so
the breakage is recent ... and more than likely related to this change.
I've only had a casual dig at the failing case ... kernel dies in memset()
as called from kmem_cache_alloc() with the address being written as
0x4000000000117b48 (which is off in the virtual address space range used
by users ... not a kernel address).
I'll dig some more tomorrow.
