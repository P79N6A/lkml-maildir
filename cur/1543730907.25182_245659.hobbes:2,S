Silly question:
GNU Midnight Commander allows for ages to go into e.g. tar files, so I 
know the benefits of this. Additionally, in GNU Midnight Commander, this 
works no matter which file system I use (e.g. it works on iso9660), and 
it even works the same way on other OS's like e.g. Solaris and NetBSD.
What is the technical reason why a tar plugin should be reiser4 
specific, instead of a generic VFS or userspace solution that would 
allow the same also on other fs like e.g. iso9660?
