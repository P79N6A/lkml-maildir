After some reboots and tests I discovered, that this error occurs only when 
the scanner was turned off during system boot and was discovered later by 
invoking the following script:
for device in /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/scan ; do
        echo "0 - -" > $device
done
With 2.6.22 and before the scanner was fully functional when discovered by a 
bus rescan.
regards,
Jörg
