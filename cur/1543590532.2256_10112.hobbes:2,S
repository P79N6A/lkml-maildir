Subject: [PATCH] fbdev logo
	Hi Linus,
This patch fixes a few bugs in the penguin logo code of the fbdev (frame buffer
device) subsystem:
  - Technical fixes:
      o The colors of the 16-color penguin logo are wrong. The logo looks like
        a psychedelic penguin holding a glass of beer (or LSD?). This is caused
	by a bug fix in the console subsystem that no longer allows us to use
	an old color palette hack. This problem is ca. 9 months old!
	Solution: replace the logo by a new one that uses colors from the
	standard console palette only.
      o Remove an obsolete #include.
      o Remove an obsolete logo file in drivers/char/sgi/ (it was removed from
        the Linux/MIPS CVS tree some months ago).
      o Use __HAVE_ARCH_LINUX_LOGO* defines to determine logo inclusion in the
        include files.
  
  - Political fixes:
      o There were still some penguins left carrying a glass of beer or wine.
        This problem is about 2 years old!
  - Aesthetical fixes:
      o Upgrade the logos to an anti-aliased variant with pleasant halo-effect.
Some of these fixes are already in Alan's tree. I'll make sure he gets a copy
of the patch relative to his tree, and will post this message to linux-kernel
(with a link to the patch).
You can find a table showing the old and new logos at my web page:

Thanks for applying this patch!

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
