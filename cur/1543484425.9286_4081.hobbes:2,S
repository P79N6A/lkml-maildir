Another possibility that springs to mind is the old one of having the
modem set to use software handshaking, and tell Linux it's using
hardware handshaking. I now pretty much automatically set up PPP to
escape all four characters that can hit this, 0x11, 0x13, 0x91 and
0x93, simply so that I don't get called out unnecessarily...
Best wishes from Riley.
