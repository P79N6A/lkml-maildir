That is the best implementation suggestion I've heard for splitting the 
filesystem into two parts, one in user space and one in kernel, but I 
still don't trust it to work well.

After reiser6 is implemented, we'll have a better idea of what parts 
need what from what other parts.  Until we get there, it needs to be 
kept together.  Frankly, I suspect that naming is not going to split so 
easily, but when it is done we'll be able to know.  The problems of 
putting too much functionality into the kernel are less than those of 
partitioning the filesystem code, and defining an inflexible API between 
the two parts.  Kernel interfaces are fairly inflexible because there 
will always be some moron who sidesteps the fs library to program 
directly to the kernel interface, gets screwed when the interface 
changes, has the nerve to complain about it, and works for some powerful 
distro.
