If you don't think it's worthwhile keeping the oldest pages
in memory around, please hand me your excess DIMMS ;)
Remember that inactive_clean pages are always immediately
reclaimable by __alloc_pages(), if you measured a performance
difference by freeing pages in a different way I'm pretty sure
it's a side effect of something else.  What that something
else is I'm curious to find out, but I'm pretty convinced that
throwing away data early isn't the way to go.
