Overall, for me, this just seems to be getting better and better with 
each iteration. I have posted a few traces that I have captured during 
some of my testing on my SMP system at home. Only the last four are from 
U3 (9-12). The others are from previous versions and in some cases 
probably aren't relevant any more. No. 9 which is the worst I've seen 
with U3 very well may have happened before the system was up completely.
