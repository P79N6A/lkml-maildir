Here are the new numbers next to the originals.  'patchedv2' is
obviously with your new patch.  Kernbench keeps getting faster :)
dbench (throughput, larger is better):
original:  357.957780 +/- 3.509188
patched:   351.266820 +/- 4.736168
patchedv2: 352.414880 +/- 3.649639
tbench (throughput, larger is better):
original:  38.710270 +/- 0.028970
patched:   38.210506 +/- 0.032954
patchedv2: 38.018038 +/- 0.024762
kernbench (time, smaller is better):
original:  91.837000 +/- 0.324471
patched:   91.466000 +/- 0.308797
patchedv2: 91.079000 +/- 0.236836
