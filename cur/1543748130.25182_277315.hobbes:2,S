This would preclude the use of a dynamic cache, not all initializations 
are performed during module
insertion.    It also breaks since there is no relationship between the 
size of the objects in the cache
and the cache name (which is causing the BUG).  
This BUG specifically means that you (or somebody else) allocated 
something and did not free it.  
That is broken.  FYC (Fix Yer Code ;-) is the answer.

No different than any other global namespace issue.
