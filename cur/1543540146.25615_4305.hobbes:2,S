It's just a matter of API. When you use socket() and write() to send
data over a TCP connection, you expect that only *valid* TCP packets are
generated. And i hope that write() checks for a valid pointer. So,
if there's a function/syscall to send ATA commands, you expect that it
sends only *valid* commands. It doesn't really matters if you can
bypass its sanity checks using another (low-level) interface.
If there's the need to send *invalid* commands, applications should use
the low-level interface. There's nothing strange in that.

Unix always had a FS layer, to allow people (even root) access the disk 
in certain way. It *does* sanity checks for root, even if it's known
that he/she can bypass them opening /dev/hd?.
As root, you have access to many different interfaces to access you IDE
disk, and all of the end up in issuing ATA commands:
- open/write/etc. on files
- open/write to /dev/hd?
- ioctl() (i see this somewhat at lower level than the above);
- direct access to controller i/o ports
The existance of the latter doesn't mean all sanity checks in the 
higher level ones are useless, even if it means that they can bypassed.
Just as when you talk to the network layer "at TCP level" it enforces
TCP correctness, but when you talk "at IP level" it lets you generate
malformed TCP packets (but not malformed IP packets), i think that when
you talk to the disk layer "at ATA level" it should enforce ATA correctness,
and of course it won't if you write directly to i/o ports.
