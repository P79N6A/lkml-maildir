Hello,
I got a problem with my irda stuff.
Version: "Linux version 2.4.2-pre2 (root@gozfand.ze) (gcc version 2.96
20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)) #1 SMP Sat Feb 10 02:26:51 CET 2001"
I try to dial to the Internet via a cellphone/irda (Nokia 8850) Dongle =
Tekram IrMate 210B dongle
It works fine on the v2.2 kernel, but it dosen't work so nice on v2.4
(2.4.0 -> 2.4.2pre2 and all ac's)
I got irda-utils-0.9.13.tar.gz and irda-utils-0.9.13-5.i386.rpm (both works
exactly the same) and pppd version 2.4.0b2-2.
Started the ir with this command: irattach /dev/ttyS0 -d tekram
	Feb 10 17:46:01 gozfand kernel: IrLAP, no activity on link!
	Feb 10 17:46:10 gozfand chat[2608]: warning: read() on stdin returned 0
	Feb 10 17:46:10 gozfand chat[2608]: send (+++)
	Feb 10 17:46:11 gozfand chat[2608]:  -- write failed: Input/output error
	Feb 10 17:46:11 gozfand chat[2608]: Failed
	Feb 10 17:46:11 gozfand chat[2608]: Can't restore terminal parameters:
Input/output error
	Feb 10 17:46:11 gozfand pppd[2606]: Connect script failed
I get that problem. After like 20 tryes, i can get the link up, for a
shortwhile.. then the message "IrLAP, no activity on link!" appears. And
kills the link.
I have this under irda support in the menuconfig:
	<M> IrDA subsystem support
	<M>   IrCOMM protocol
	[*]   Ultra (connectionless) protocol
	[*]   IrDA protocol options
	[*]     Cache last LSAP
	[*]     Fast RRs
	<M> IrTTY (uses Linux serial driver)
	<M> IrPORT (IrDA serial driver)
	[*] Serial dongle support
	<M>   Tekram IrMate 210B dongle
And this is from "lsmod":
	ircomm-tty             32144   0
	ircomm                 13904   0  [ircomm-tty]
	tekram                  2192   1  (autoclean)
	irtty                   7728   2  (autoclean)
	irda                  157904   1  (autoclean) [ircomm-tty ircomm tekram
irtty]
I have tryed it on a other computer, with rh7 2.4, and it was the same
there.
Sorry for the misspelling!
Thanks,
Fredrik Falk
