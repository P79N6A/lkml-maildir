For example, for mounting an NFS root using that device.... Oh, will I
need an initramfs for that once you pull the firmware-in-kernel
option?
To me, device probe is in fact the place to fail firmware discovery
for networking devices.  Because such a failure can mean you can't
mount your root filesystem.
