and as of a few days ago we have a second driver that can handle
Bluetooth Type-A and Type-B SDIO cards. It has been tested with a card
from Socket which is actually manufactured by Toshiba.
hci0:   Type: SDIO
        BD Address: 00:02:C7:xx:xx:xx ACL MTU: 676:4 SCO MTU: 120:3
        HCI Ver: 1.1 (0x1) HCI Rev: 0x0 LMP Ver: 1.1 (0x1) LMP Subver: 0x14b
        Manufacturer: Toshiba Corp. (4)
        Features: 0xff 0xf9 0x21 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
                <3-slot packets> <5-slot packets> <encryption> <slot offset> 
                <timing accuracy> <role switch> <hold mode> <sniff mode> 
                <park state> <SCO link> <HV2 packets> <HV3 packets> 
                <u-law log> <A-law log> <CVSD> 
The code for the btsdio.ko driver can be found here:
http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/holtmann/btsdio.git;a=summary
There are other Bluetooth SDIO cards that don't follow the Type-A or
Type-B standard. These use the UART standard, but unfortunately the
specification for the SDIO UART cards is not public.
