GCC mainline (ie future GCC4.3.0) now give:
0000000000000000 <f>:
   0:   b0 01                   mov    $0x1,%al
   2:   b9 06 00 00 00          mov    $0x6,%ecx
   7:   f3 aa                   rep stos %al,%es:(%rdi)
   9:   c3                      retq 
That is smallest, definitly not fastest.
GCC up to 4.3.0 won't be able to inline memset with non-0 operand...
