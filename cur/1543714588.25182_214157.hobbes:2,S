While I don't want to get into the business of maintaining
a dmi_scan entry for every system with this issue, I think
it might be a good idea to add a couple of example entries
for high volume systems for which there is no BIOS fix available.
Got any opinions on which system to use as the example?
I'll need the output from dmidecode for them.

"acpi_skip_timer_override" is specific to IOAPIC mode,
since that is the only place that the bogus interrupt
source override is used.
I'm not clued-in on the nmi_watchdog and 8259 ack issues.
My focus is primarily the ACPI issues involved in getting
these systems up and running in IOAPIC mode.

Clearly this hang issue is more important than the timer issue.
I'm impressed that you built such a sophisticated patch without
any support from the vendors.  But it would be a "really good thing"
if we got some input from the vendors before considering putting
a workaround into the upstream kernel -- for they may have
guidance which would either simplify it, or make it unnecessary.
Perhaps Allen Martin at nVidia can comment?
