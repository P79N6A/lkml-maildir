Which means only one thing - changing that API will affect very few
things.
Let's keep the kernel side sane.  We don't have to mess with multiplexors
and even if we decide to use them, we will be better off by having decoder
outside of AFS proper.  Again, take a look at interaction between userland
and knfsd.  Right now we have a sane interface (IO on nfsctl files) and
we have a wrapper (sys_nfsctl) that does decode/open/write/read/close.
