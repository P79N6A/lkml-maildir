I worry that using something like "vps" obfuscates the real meaning a
bit.  The reason that "owner_vps" doesn't sound weird is that people, by
default, usually won't understand what a "vps" is.
(if you like acronyms a lot, I'm sure I can find a job for you at IBM or
in the US military :)

That makes sense.  However, are there many cases in the kernel where a
task ends up doing something temporary like this:
	tsk->exec_vnc = bar;
	do_something_here(task);
	tsk->exec_vnc = foo;
If that's the case very often, we probably want to change the APIs, just
to make the common action explicit.  If it never happens, or is a
rarity, I think it should be just fine.

I guess it does keep you from running into issues with mixing 32 and
64-bit processes.  But, haven't we solved those problems already?  Is it
just a pain?

It sounds to me like anything that needs to have an action taken when a
refcount reaches zero is a good candidate for a kref.  Both of those
uses sound like they need that.  Probably not too big of a deal, though.
