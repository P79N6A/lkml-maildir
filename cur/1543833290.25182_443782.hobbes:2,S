Great idea Chunk! We already use them in the syscall, it sounds a
perfect fit ;).

The only single advantage I can see in remaining purely in function of
seccomp instead of going in function of _TIF_NOTSC, is that the below
block would be completely optimized away at compile time when
CONFIG_SECCOMP is set to N. This now become a slow-path, but then I'm
unsure if the anti-seccomp advocates can live with this block in the
slow path given that seccomp will be the only user of the feature. I
suspect they won't like it but then I could be wrong.
I like it either ways.
	/*
	 * Context switch may need to tweak the TSC disable bit in CR4.
	 * The optimizer should remove this code when !CONFIG_SECCOMP.
	 */
	if (has_secure_computing(task_thread_info(prev_p)) ^
	    has_secure_computing(task_thread_info(next_p))) {
		/* prev and next are different */
		if (has_secure_computing(task_thread_info(next_p)))
			write_cr4(read_cr4() | X86_CR4_TSD);
		else
			write_cr4(read_cr4() & ~X86_CR4_TSD);
	}
