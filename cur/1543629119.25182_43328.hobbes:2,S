what kernel pagetables? pagetables for space that you left free for
what? You waste virtual space for that at the very least on x86 that is
just very tigh, at this point kernel virtual space is more costly than
physical space these days. And nevertheless most archs doesn't have
pagetables at all to read and write the page structures. yes it's
virtual memory but it's a direct mapping. DaveM even rewrote the palcode
of sparc to skip the pagetable walking for kernel direct mapping. alpha
mips have a kseg that maps to physical addresses directly. there are
_no_ pagetables for the mem_map in most archs, the palcode resolves it
directly without using the tlb. So if you move mem_map to pagetables
like modules to handle hotplug you just made automatically the whole
kernel slower due the additional pte walking and tlb trashing.
