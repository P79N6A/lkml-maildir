With this compilation, the 'C' compiler looked and said; "you
are just going to return 0..." So that's the code it generated.
This compiler probably defaults to "-fomit-frame-pointer".

With this compiler, it assumed that you were going to do something
useful so it set up a stack-frame. It also aligned the stack after
it saved the intitial value in EBP. Then it cleared the return-
value, reset the stack, and returned.
This compiler did not default to "-fomit-frame-pointer" so it
set up a stack-frame.

There is nothing wrong here at all.
