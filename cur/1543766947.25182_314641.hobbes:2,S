Subject: [RFC/PATCH 0/5] read/write on attribute w/o show/store should return -ENOSYS

Hi,
Jean Delvare has noticed that if a driver happens to declare its
attribute as RW but doesn't provide store() method attempt to write
into such attribute will cause spinning process as most of the
attribute implementations return 0 in case of missing store causing
endless retries. In some cases missing show/store will return -EPERM,
-EACCESS or -EINVAL.
I think we should unify implementations and have them all return -ENOSYS
(function not implemented) when corresponding method (show/store) is
missing.
