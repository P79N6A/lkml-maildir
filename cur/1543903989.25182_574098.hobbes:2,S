No. Memory barriers explicitly extend to all memory references.

Repeating what has been said before: A CPU memory barrier is not a
compiler barrier or vice versa. Seeing as we are talking about
the compiler barrier, it is irrelevant as to whether or not the
assembly includes a CPU barrier.

Yes it makes sense to let the compiler move memory operations over
clear_bit(), because we have defined the interface to be nice and
relaxed. And this is exactly why we do need to have an additional
barrier there in smp_mb__*_clear_bit().

correct output != correct input.
Without a barrier there, we _allow_ the compiler to reorder. If it
does not reorder, the missing barrier is still a bug :)
