> Ick, nasty.  Seems there's quite a few instances of that construct around.
The cases you grepped out here all seem to be OK to my eyes.
They fall into two categories of legitimate uses:
1) The return value really is a boolean, 0 or 1, so using
   likely/unlikely around it is fine.
   In fact, for a inline function returning a boolean, this
   is a way to get the likely'ness to propagate into a test
   done by the caller.
2) The likely() is part of some real check such as:
   return (likely(test_val) ? x : y);
   which is also fine.
Like I said, the bad case is only when the unlikely() or likely()
surrounds an expression that is not expected to evaluate to
a boolean.
