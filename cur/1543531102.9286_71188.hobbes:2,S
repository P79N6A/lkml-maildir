The rogue program would have to _touch_ all the pages in the system during
a single time-slice. Once it started using pages in the backing-store,
this would be impossible because disk I/O sleeps.
The monitor daemon only has to work as fast as a person. Try it from a
logged-in shell. You can wait until your swap-file disk-drive starts
thrashing then have plenty of resources available to kill the task as
long as you know ahead of time what its pid was. It is presumed that
the daemon will keep track of heavy-breathers and certainly know who's
the blame before an OOM condition occurs.

No. As long as you have backing store (swap file), you will have plenty
of CPU available for the monitor program. The monitor program has to
be designed properly. It has to allocate its memory upon startup.
It has to use runtime function calls to handle tasks, not forking and
exec. For the most part, it sits there reading the /proc file-system.
