I've no idea what could be wrong with the graphics drivers, there are no
changes there.

please try to find which is this module, replace modprobe with a script
that does:
#!/bin/sh
echo $@ >>/tmp/log
sync
modprobe.orig $@
then look at log after the crash. You said in your last email that the
gart code wasn't the culprit. If it isn't the sound drivers I've no
clue what it is. What does it mean the without agpgart it is very
stable? That it crashes less frequently? (I recalled it crashed even
without those modules)
It doesn't make any sense that 2.4.20-pre11 works and my tree doesn't,
there are no changes to those sound and graphics driver. Can you make
sure that modversions is enabled, and please send me your .config.
Andrea
