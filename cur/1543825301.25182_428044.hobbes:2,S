hm, this one could perhaps be a real bug. Dave: lockdep complains about 
having observed:
	anon_vma->lock  =>   mm->mmap_sem
	mm->mmap_sem    =>   anon_vma->lock
locking sequences, in the cpufreq code. Is there some special runtime 
behavior that still makes this safe, or is it a real bug?

there's one small detail to improve future lockdep printouts: please set 
CONFIG_STACK_BACKTRACE_COLS=1, so that the backtrace is more readable. 
(i'll change the code to force that when CONFIG_LOCKDEP is enabled)

ok, will check this.
