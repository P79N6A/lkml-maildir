 You don't want to cache fb memory, do you?  All you want is write
combining and you achieve it with memory barriers.  You write to fb memory
space whatever you need to and write buffers actually deliver data to fb
memory whenever the bus is idle or they get filled up.  When you finally
decide you wrote all data and you want ensure it actually reaches the fb
memory before you perform an operation (say you send a command to fb's
support circuitry) you issue a write memory barrier.  Or a memory barrier,
if you want ensure the data reaches the fb memory ASAP.
 In other words, you have write-combining by default and request
write-through explicitly.

 Please forgive me -- I can't see how this is related to write combining.

 They do -- you issue an mb and you are sure all pending writes reached
the involved PCI hw.
