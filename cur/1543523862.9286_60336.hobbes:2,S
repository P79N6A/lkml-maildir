          Hi,
  I'm trying to decompile a kernel. I know that seems very odd but I want to
be able to change the frame buffer boot logo *without* having to recompile
the kernel. I guess I could directly patch the wmlinux file, by getting the
right offsets with 'nm'.
  My problem is: how to obtain vmlinux from a bzImage (and maybe the System.map
                 if it helps)?
  Any idea?
          Thanks in advance 
             DindinX.
