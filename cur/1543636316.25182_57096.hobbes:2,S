This doesn't mean an OS shouldn't specify the behavior.  Just because
the cross-platform standard leaves it unspecified doesn't mean the OS
should.
Consider what this says, if a particular OS doesn't pick a standard
which the application can port to.  It means that the *only way* to
correctly close a file descriptor is like this:
int ret;
do {
	ret = close(fd);
} while(ret == -1 && errno != EBADF);
That means, if we get an error, we have to loop until the kernel throws
a BADF error!  We can't detect that the file is closed from any other
error value, because only BADF has a defined behavior.
This would sort of work, though of course be hideous, for a single
threaded app.  Now consider a multithreaded app.  To correctly implement
this we have to lock around all calls to close and
open/socket/dup/pipe/creat/etc...
This is clearly ridiculous, and not at all as intended.  Either standard
will work for an OS (though guaranteeing close the first time is much
simpler all around), but it needs to be specified and stuck to, or you
get horrible things like this to work around a bad spec:
void lock_syscalls();
void unlock_syscalls();
int threadsafe_open(const char *file, int flags, mode_t mode)
{
	int fd;
	lock_syscalls();
	fd = open(file, flags, mode);
	unlock_syscalls();
	return fd;
}
int threadsafe_close(int fd)
{
	int ret;
	lock_syscalls();
	do {
		ret = close(fd);
	} while(ret == -1 && errno != EBADF);
	unlock_syscalls();
	return ret;
}
int threadsafe_socket() ...
int threadsafe_pipe() ...
int threadsafe_dup() ...
int threadsafe_creat() ...
int threadsafe_socketpair() ...
int threadsafe_accept() ...
