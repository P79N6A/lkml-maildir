This makes headers_install_all unreliable.
linux/kvm.h will not be exported, depending on what system the libc
headers will be generated. Please revert
fb56dbb31c4738a3918db81fd24da732ce3b4ae6 and find a different way to run
make headers_check successfully.
Similar CONFIG_* usage is in include/asm-cris/Kbuild.
Fortunately, its not relevant in practice.
