OK. I will give that a shot, probably this evening.
Shouldn't kconfig recursively figure out dependencies for stuff like this?
I turned on Apple Cinema support without turning on the framebuffer, but 
Cinema needed backlight, which needed framebuffer. I can see kconfig turning 
on backlight, but not checking to see what backlight needed.
There might be similar issues with snd-miro, which seems to want stuff in 
snd_cs4231, which I think I have shut off.
Thanks for your help. I try out your patch later on today, when I can get back 
to my computer.
