Note that hangs in that file almost always mean "your BIOS is goofy".
Hunt for BIOS settings related to USB, and change them.  As a rule, if
you tell your BIOS to ignore USB devices (mostly keyboards and disks),
it will have even less of an excuse to break like that.

Does the current kernel.org GIT tree do the same thing?  A bunch
of USB patches were recently merged, including ISTR one in that
area ...

Should be unrelated.  That patch related to how vendor-specific
implementation differences get detected and handled ... basically
just switching to a table-driven approach that can even handle
board-specific wiring braindamage, rather than the original scheme
which was just a big if/then/else looking only at chip vendors.
