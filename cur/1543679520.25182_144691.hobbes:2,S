And to be complete, Nokia D211, which has GSM, GPRS and WLAN. Partially
binary-only. Trying to use the WLAN side on the latest RH9 errata kernel for 
more than 5 minutes usually crashes the machine, GSM side works just fine.
Unfortunately life is too short to debug proprietary drivers ;) 
There's also the older Card Phone which has two versions, 1.0 used
a modified pcmcia serial driver. Hackery probably required to
get it working with modern pcmcia code/kernels. 2.0 is 
more or less standard pcmcia serial I believe...
