The IrDA folks have had a similar struggle.  AJ, perhaps it would be
helpful for you to read the discussion that took place regarding getting
a bunch of IrDA code merged into the 2.4 tree:

Dag Brattli <dagb@fast.no> eventually had a discussion with Linus and
hashed out what he needed to do to get Linus to accept his big patch. 
It all
