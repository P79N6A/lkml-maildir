Hi !
I still have my probs with kernel 2.2.1 on a dual P2 system . 
I have followed some articles about kernel crashes because of probs with
ide and the dma access . 
A suggestion was to disable the dma access mode in the kernel . 
I did this . No effect . 
The system crashed while scrolling in kedit . 
So I disabled some other settings . Like the mtrr setting . 
The documentation about mtrr is not very informative , but it said that
the mtrr can improve acces to agp port and can solve some problems with
the smp mode (settings) [ it said that some bios version do not proper
set up both cpu´s , so i thought this could be a helping option ]
In the next hours I will test the system with the new options , and then
I will see what happens .
Does anyone of you have equal problems on a similar hardware with this
kernel ? 
Thank you for any idea and/or suggestion .
Bye and good night/or better good morning 
Roland
