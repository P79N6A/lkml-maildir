Have you applied any extra patches to NFS? I remember one of my
patches (availalble from my WWW-page, but clearly marked experimental)
was generating these messages gratuitously.
If, on the other hand, you're using a clean kernel, I'd look into what
the server is doing. It sounds like it's doing the same thing that the
userland `nfs-server' does: namely to recycle filehandles after a file
gets deleted...
Cheers,
