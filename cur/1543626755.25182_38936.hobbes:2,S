I found a .config difference between my 2.4.19-pre5-ac3 setup
and my 2.4.19-pre6 (swsusp v0.8 patched) setup.
After making both the same, both generally oops in the same place
as previously reported (oops via ksymoops previously posted).
Findings thus far:
   swsusp says it doesn't need APM. But it does. at least so far
   as menuconfig is concerned.
   With apm loaded (or built) in the kernel swsusp says it can't
   terminate/kill kapmd and gives up.
   With apm *not* loaded in the kernel swsusp oopses as previously
   reported.
Nice repeatable behavior.
Documentation/swsusp.txt which is repeatedly refered to does not
exist, either in the ac version or the v0.8 patch.
I have not been able to find the swsusp program which is also
refered to.
