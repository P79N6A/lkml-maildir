But won't it affect retry features of other `good' software such as wget?  At
any rate, people are downloading from web/ftp sites on the Internet, which are
beyond our control, and apache hacks are anyway impossible.  However, I am
thinking of setting up a transparent proxy (squid/iptables) on the firewall and
let it handle the bandwidth limiting and the like.

I don't mind hacking approaches.  Otherwise, I won't be reading the LKML ;-)

That is a wonderful idea.  Trying to exploit features on the Internet should be
a punishable offence ;)
