Why? The page should eventually get into memory from the disk,
at this point the process doing the copy can continue, and
when it finishes the other processes gets waked up. While the
copy_to_user is in progress all the processes witht this mm
should be in noninterruptible sleep. The sleeping procces
doesn't need to do anything to get the page into memory, so I
cannot see the problem.
