That's on my TODO list - make %gs set correctly before hitting C code, 
and get rid of all the early_* stuff.  I had already encountered a 
PDA-related oops with lockdep enabled, and addressed it.
It's pretty easy to solve in general for the boot CPU, but its a bit 
more tricky to handle for secondary CPUs.
Laurent, could you resend your original oops?  It doesn't seem to have 
appeared on lkml.
In the meantime, I'll work on a proper fix for this.
