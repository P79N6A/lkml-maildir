Ahh, yes. The write merging code doesn't check for no readers.

However, that has always been true. Look at the old code: it would set
POLLIN for a non-empty pipe for both readers and writers (and do POLLOUT
for empty pipes both for readers and writers). In fact, your very own
original strace shows that - it shows "in [4]" even though fd 4 is a
write-only fd.
The new code does nothing really different. POLLIN is still there for a
non-empty pipe, just like it was before. It's just that when you have
multiple buffers, POLLOUT can _also_ be true, since even if you have
_some_ data in the pipe, you can still do a write of a full PIPE_BUF.
So the difference is not at all the one you're talking about, and the 
"bug" you claim to fix was there before too.
The fact is that if this broke python-twisted, then it just happened to
work before by mistake. And python-twisted is just plain bogus.
That said, I agree with the fact that it's probably not the right thing to
do, and never was. And if fixing it makes a difference to python-twisted,
then hey, that's a benefit, but not a reason for the patch.
I don't agree with your patch, though - I don't like your lack of
parenthesis ;)
