yes, I did ;-)

Badblocks finds each time ONE bad block at the end of the partition no
matter where I create it or how large the partition is. Syslog shows this

the same occurs when I try to
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda6 bs=1024 count=594373
dd: writing `/dev/hda6': Input/output error
594373+0 records in

I've tried many times to repartition the whole disk...

where should I try to find it? ("SWAP-SPACE" | "SWAPSPACE2")

I have some problem with ksymoops - some unresolved symbols. I read about it
and problems with binutils and their libraries. I hope, I'll solve this

What means the problems I (only) once noticed about the signature?
