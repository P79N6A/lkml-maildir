Tuff nuggies to the SELinux people.. Show them code good enough they'd be
embarrassed to reject.

Not sure why you're rehashing this.  We all know that not everyone
agrees with AA.  The point is users should have a choice.. choice is
good.  But that's not a justification for bloating the kernel with
a bunch of code that isn't needed and can be refactored into a
small extension of what already exists.

I'm not convinced in practice you really need a unique label for every
file.  Large swathes of the system would have a shared label etc..  So
let's not get caught up on theoretical arguments that don't really play
in practice.  Has anyone on the AA team actually _tried_ to extend
SELinux instead of reinventing the wheel?

The AA extension will have a path-to-label mapping.  Conceptually that's
exactly what its doing now.  Look at the arguments by AA proponents that
the only difference between the AA method and SELinux is _when_ those
labels are created...  Sorry i don't have a link handy, but i can dig one
up if you dispute that this argument has been made by the AA folks.

True, but so what?

Who says that's what is "supposed" to be in all situations?   It makes more
sense to target the best API that lets you implement the features you want.

BS.  All we're talking about is an extension that allows SELinux to
generate labels on the fly.   That goes most the way towards giving
you all the functionality you're after and should be a much smaller patch
in the end, reusing code that already exists in the kernel.

Whoa.  Again you're mistaking the current state of SELinux, rather than
SELinux + AA extension.   If such a beast provides the same features you
get with the current AA implementation, why would you care?

All that is irrelevant to the discussion though.

But "working implementation" is _not_ the criteria for acceptance into
the kernel and that's what this discussion is about.

To be fair, that's not their job.

Because i'm not the one trying to get something into the kernel.  I'm not
the one who has to show that my patches are reasonable and make best use
of the current kernel infrastructure possible.
