Does that happen frequently, or only once?
If it happens frequently, then you could try to replace the WQ_BUG with
extern void show_stack(unsigned long *esp);
#define WQ_BUG() do { \
	printk("wq bug!.\n"); \
	show_stack(NULL); \
	__sti(); \
	for(;;); \
	} while(0);
[untested]
It _seems_ that the stack pointer got corrupted, and thus the kernel
couldn't recover from the oops
