Hi!

is possible.

This worked before -rmap came in, but it does not free anything
now. What needs to be done to fix it?
								Pavel 
static void free_some_memory(void)
{
        printk("Freeing memory: ");
        while
(try_to_free_pages(&contig_page_data.node_zones[ZONE_HIGHMEM], GFP_KSWAPD, 0))
                printk(".");
        printk("|\n");
}
