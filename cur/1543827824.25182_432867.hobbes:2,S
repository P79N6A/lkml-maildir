It isn't "policy" its called copyright law.

You don't seem to understand copyright law either. The GPL like all
copyright licenses deals with the right to make copies and to create and
control derivative works. It's not "defeated" by four lines of code.

Copyright is not about novelty, you have it confused with the
theoretical (not actual) role of patents. Wrong kind of intellectual
