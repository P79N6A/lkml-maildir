Speaking of which, please consider merging this.  It
missed Greg's push on Friday, but it's needed to build
OHCI and EHCI with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG when !CONFIG_PM.
By request, this adds (and uses) a new API call to hide
the necessary #ifdef once, rather than repeat it in every
driver.  It's an accessor for a field only exists when
#ifdef CONFIG_PM.  These particular references prevent
dumping registers when that part of the chip suspended.
