There is only one queue in the i8042, shared for KBD and AUX. To see if
any data is present, you check the I8042_STR_IBF bit. The
I8042_STR_AUXDATA bit then says which device the data came from.
You can't choose which device you want to read from.
Now I think the problem lies in that that on your i8042 issuing a
command doesn't clear the AUXDATA bit. It's only cleared by data from
the keyboard.
This is likely a bug in you i8042 firmware (or hw, if it's just an
ASIC).
I suppose we can get rid of the checking of data source and negation and
be done with it.
