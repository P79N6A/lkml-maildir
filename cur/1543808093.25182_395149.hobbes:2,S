I'd like to put a theory out there:  the more isolation we perform, the
easier checkpointing and migration become to guarantee.
Agree?  Disagree?
But, full isolation is hard to code.  The right approach is very likely
somewhere in the middle where we require some things to happen
underneath us.  For instance, requiring that the filesystem be made
consistent if a container is moved across systems.
