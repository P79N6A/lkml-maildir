this thought of you is still false. Nick said:
 ' I think Ingo said that some "static tracepoints" (eg. annotation) 
   could be acceptable. '
to which you replied:
  ' No, he made it rather clear, that as far as possible he only wants 
    dynamic annotations (e.g. via function attributes). '
That "No" word at the beginning of your sentence, by its plain meaning, 
falsely questions Nick's correct interpretation of what I said. I ask 
you to retract or correct this false statement.
Nick is of course correct: i said before that some static markups could 
be acceptable. In fact, i even outlined a possible API for such static 
markups in 20060914231956.GB29229@elte.hu. Would I want to reduce the 
number of such static markups: of course, not wanting to reduce the 
number of subsystem-functionality unrelated source code lines would be 
foolish.

this answer of yours does not rectify the false statement you did.
Your sentence also introduces a new misrepresentation of my intentions: 
my intention with partial static markups (which intention i've written 
to you about before, so it was known to you when you wrote this 
stentence) is not to support "all possible users", but to support 
dynamic tracers. Static tracers cannot use static markups that go away 
into dynamic tracing scripts.
