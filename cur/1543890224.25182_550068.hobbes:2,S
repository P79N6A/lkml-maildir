I haven't tested with version 6, but after removing the LZO_CHECK_MPOS_NON_DET 
macro from the 'take 5' code and replacing the open-coded byte-for-byte 
copies with calls to memcpy:
10000 run averages:
'Tiny LZO':
        Combined: 57.4691 usec
        Compression: 39.8837 usec
        Decompression: 17.5854 usec
'miniLZO':
        Combined: 64.0484 usec
        Compression: 46.0604 usec
        Decompression: 17.988 usec
which means:
Overall TinyLZO is 10.2% faster
TinyLZO compresses 13.4% faster
TinyLZO decompresses 2.23% faster
-Benchmark run a a Pentium-M 1.73GHz, 1GB Ram
With the speed-up seen with just the removal of the LZO_CHECK_MPOS_NON_DET I 
wasn't sure that changing the open-coded copy to a call to memcpy() was going 
to have a big impact on the code, but it does appear to have has several 
percentage points of difference. (Though I am unsure about the speed increase 
with the decompression - I didn't touch that file when making this set of 
changes. I'm going to make the memcpy() changes to 'take 6' and see if the 
speed-up holds true)
