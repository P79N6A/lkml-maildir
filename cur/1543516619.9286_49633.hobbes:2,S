We are throwing out most of the schedule tracking stuff that gets included into
buffer.c as part of our SMP overhaul, and that should be done soon (it is being
debugged now.)
That said, we don't distrurb other folks's code, so why is it such an issue?
I don't understand the comment about exporting half of the buffer cache into
itself.

This is a RAID/MM design issue.  Surely you can't blame us for that one.... and
surely it is not so hard to make journaling and RAID exclusive configurations
until it gets worked out.....

Get Linux (
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS
 (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
