Yes, I think you need to be careful with the idle thread, some events may or
may not count when going low-power. I think it is best to avoid going
low-power for measurements. It is also useful for some measurements to
exclude the idle task, i.e., to get useful kernel execution. For that
you can use the --excl-idle option of pfmon.

I think this is an issue with the NMI setup. I have looked at the code and found
some problems. They wil be fixed in the next patch. I suspect that if you say nmi_watchdog=2
on the kernel cmdline, it will work.
I have added the following 3 patches.
Thanks.
