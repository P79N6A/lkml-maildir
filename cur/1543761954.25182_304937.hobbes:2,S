It is no biggie and probably not worth breaking users' configuration
like you said, but most drivers do not have their KBUILD_MODNAME
included in the parameter names.
Setting parameters that have KBUILD_MODNAME as prefix from the kernel
commandline is then done by KBUILD_MODNAME.KBUILD_MODNAME_xxx and that
is plain ugly - especially when a list of parameters are generated
from the source.
Some bad citizens IMO:
dvb.dvb_shutdown_timeout, asus.asus_gid, arlan.arlan_entry_debug

Ok, just fixing errors: frontend_debug should be renamed to
dvb_frontend_debug or the parameter description should at least match
the parameter...
