No one has leaped in here with any wisdom, but the people
who wrote that code may be dead or otherwise employed.
If you have knowledge of how those bits work,
I encourage to you dig through the code and determine
what needs to be done. It is certainly an area that can
use more review.
I did see a comment that tty_mutex protects the creation
and destruction of tty structures, so I assume the coverage
of tty_old_pgrp has some relation to that. Unfortunately,
I have seen other locks get borrowed for multiple purposes.
