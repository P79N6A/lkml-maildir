Sure, on powerpc for some of the embedded sub-architectures you can  
only select a single board to build for.  For a lot of people this is  
sufficient, however we are moving towards a world where you can  
easily build in support for multiple boards into a single kernel.
I'd like to have it such that if I'm only building support for one  
board (CONFIG_ONLY_HAVE_ONE, not going to call it that, but for this  
discussion its sufficient), you get a choice menu from Kconfig  
enforcing the ability to only select one board.  However if ! 
CONFIG_ONLY_HAVE_ONE than you can select multiple boards to build  
into your kernel.
if CONFIG_ONLY_HAVE_ONE is set we can optimize out the runtime checks  
that get added for handling the multiple board case.
Hopefully that's clear.
