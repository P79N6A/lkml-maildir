Once the deadlock has occurred it's too late.  You can't give up; in 
fact you can't do anything at all.  The system has hung.

What on Earth are you talking about?  "Kernel locks should not be held 
by user tasks"?  Then who _should_ hold them?  You are aware, I hope, 
that down() and mutex_lock() can be called only in process context?

Lots of them.  For example, most drivers won't want a suspend to occur
right in the middle of an I/O transfer.  To prevent this, the driver
might use a mutex.  The task doing the I/O (which will be a user task)
acquires the mutex during a transfer and the suspend routine acquires
the mutex while quiescing the device.

Please read Documentation/power/devices.txt.

That's what you would call standby, suspend-to-RAM, or hibernate.  The
entire system goes to sleep.

That's when an individual device is placed in a low-power state to 
save energy while it isn't being used.  The system as a whole remains 
awake and the device will be resumed the next time it is needed for 
anything.
