Yes, nice idea, but easier said than done. :)
Unfortunately esd is started by the gnome desktop environment and I
can disable or enable it, but can't set any parameters (as far as I
can see). Probably I'll disable it for good, as emu10k1 driver already
does a great job mixing multiple sound streams.
