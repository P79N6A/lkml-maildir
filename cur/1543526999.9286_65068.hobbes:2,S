We don't. They plug in if/when you need to upgrade. The controllers
come 'free' with the embedded chip-sets. Free, meaning you couldn't
get rid of them if you wanted to.
We find that the customer(s) will completely screw up the contents of
NVRAM (their applications can write to it using our Linux driver). If they
write to the wrong page, there goes everything necessary to boot. So,
I have a "recovery-floppy" with assembly-language that re-writes NVRAM,
then reboots using NVRAM. The user's parameters are lost, but who cares.
We don't ever use DOS or anything as gross. The recovery-floppy doesn't
start Linux or anything, it 'knows' where to get the NVRAM stuff as
a physical offset and rewrites NVRAM, after which it reboots.
Cheers,
