There's a fairly large number of these "Core Duo" systems out there :)
Hopefully these are the last CPUs lacking longmode that Intel will make.
Asides from these, the only other 32-bit only CPUs with NX are the newer VIA C3s.
For the Fedora users it's not that big a deal not being able to take advantage
of NX, as we fall back to using the old segment limit tricks that exec-shield
does to emulate NX, without having to worry about PAE headaches.
Given the only other use of PAE is >4GB support, and these systems typically
max out at 4GB due to the limited number of memory slots, it's not really that
big a problem.

Sounds good to me.
