Regarding the rehash check in ip_conntrack_find_get, wouldn't it be
better to do that in the confirm function, where a new conntrack
is put into the list? That's called a lot less often than _find_get,
and should be logically equivalent. IOW, why wait until we _find_
an overly long list, when we can rehash at the point in time when
it _became_ overly long?
best regards
