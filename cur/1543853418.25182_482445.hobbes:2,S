That's forbidden by the PCI spec:
    "An MSI or MSI-X message, by virtue of being a posted memory write
    (PMW) transaction, is prohibited by PCI ordering rules from
    passing PMW transactions sent earlier by the function. The system
    must guarantee that an interrupt service routine invoked as a
    result of a given message will observe any updates performed by
    PMW transactions arriving prior to that message."
which is not to say that there are no chipsets with errata in this
area.  But I've never heard of such a thing...
