Well, I believe that my suggestion *does* match what PC systems do.
It will mean that writes to memory are ordered with respect to
following MMIO writes.  MMIO writes aren't ordered with respect to
following stores to memory, but then nobody sane expects that if you
do a writel() then a store to memory, the writel will hit the device
before the store hits memory; even PC systems do PCI write posting.
As for the writel followed by spin_unlock thing, Ben and I have an
idea for some debug code that will detect at runtime if someone does a
writel followed by a spin_unlock without a readl, spin_lock or mmiowb
in between.
The main question I'm trying to decide at the moment is whether to
make the change for 2.6.18 or not...  If not then I'd like to get the
wmb() into tg3.c temporarily to fix that particular data corruption
problem.
Paul.
