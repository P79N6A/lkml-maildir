I believe I know why a lot of people are reporting problems like this and
why a lot of people think that the synbomb protection stuff isn't working.
(Background:)
Here at NetNation, we have a machine dedicated to routing traffic from
four physical networks.  One of the connections goes down to a company
down a few floors in the building which is our Internet uplink.  The
machine handles about 8 MBit/traffic sec on average from about 20 other
web servers, mail servers, dedicated servers, etc.
About 6 months ago when the traffic was a bit less, we began to notice
that routes would randomly stop working for a few seconds and then work
again...Usually after they've been idle for a while.  It began to get
worse and worse, and it was really quite difficult to figure out what was
happening.  Whenever I tried to get a tcpdump, it would always start
working.  As time went on, it got more and more frustrating as a lot more
people were seeing the problem and other staff were reporting that they
randomly weren't able to access their mail, etc.  So, I spent several days
doing all I could to try to track it down...
Eventually, I found that it might be related to ARPs not working or the
ARP table being limited by a maximum size...I checked the kernel and
didn't find anything...checked the switch manual and it was well under
the max...so I dug further and finally discovered that it might be
something to do with the route cache stuff.  So, I added a whole wad of
printk()s and it turned out to be that the garbage collection stuff for
the route cache had a _minimum_ cleanup interval that was by default far
too long and the route cache table size was hitting the root, causing
ip_route_output_slow()'s call to dst_alloc() to fail.  When this happens, 
forwarding packets are just dropped and no message to track it down is
produced.
(Solution:)
Sure enough, this was the problem.  I traced around through all the code
and found that the settings linked to some /proc files -- tweaking them
caused the problem to eventually go away completely.  I had tweaked them
quite stupidly (not understanding what they did), but in a message on
January 28th, Alexey Kuznetsov sent me a message explaining that I should
decrease gc_min_interval but not touch the gc_max_size (because it's the
maximum number of records to fit in a fixed-size hash table).  After doing
this, everything was fine and dandy.  Of course, gc_min_interval is in
seconds, and so eventually it's going to be a problem again (it already
defaults to 5, and I set it to 1).
So, I have a question... Why the heck is there a minimum cleanup interval,
anyway?  Shouldn't it just clean up as much as it needs to?  I can
understand how cleanup later would make routing a bit faster, but sticking
a minimum time limit on how frequently it can clean up is kind of silly in
my opinion...
(Relating to Synbombing:)
Anyway...The reason why I think this is related to synbombing stuff is
because when people usually get synbombed, the idea is that the host
sending the bomb is supposed to spoof each SYN from a bunch of random IPs
in hopes that most of them will not reply with an RST and the host will be
"stuck" with a bunch of IPs that don't say "no, I didn't ask for that, go
away".  So, if more than /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size fake IPs are
attempted to be replied to with a syn cookie (or another SYN or whatever)
and the garbage cleanup isn't going to remove them in time, it's going to
hit the roof and cause new routes not to be allocated again.
So, I tested my theory.  I pulled out an old syn bombing program I wrote
to test on the IRC server I was writing a looooong time ago, and bombed my
IRC server.  Sure enough, afterwards I was not able to ping another
machine on the network:
...ermm...Hrm, I just ran it again and realized that I can lock up my
machine hard by synbombing myself (2.2.3ac1).  Odd.  I will look at this
further in a bit...perhaps it has something to do with my printk patch
(below).  Anyway, try #2:
...ermm....okay, this time it rebooted itself.  Very interesting.  Lets
try with a few less packets...
...arf, dead again, and this time it overwrote my first superblock with
crap.  There's something very bad happening.
Anyway, what happened is that I got "ENOBUFS" from ping for a second or so
and then it tried again and had enough room in the route cache table to
add the route from ip_route_output_slow().  So, I'm guessing this is what
was happening.
As a test, perhaps try doing this to see if it makes any difference:
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_min_interval
...This should allow it to clean up as much as it needs to.
Also, you may want to try applying the attached patch to see if it's
really hitting this limit.  I recommend that something like it should
actually go into the kernel, because the problem really bit me hard on the
routing machine and it took forever for me to track it down.  Of course,
something like the attached patch is probably not very safe because it
will spam you like crazy if more and more packets without cached routes
are trying to go through...It'd need something to throttle the message.
Let me know if it makes any difference.
