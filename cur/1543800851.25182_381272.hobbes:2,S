Huh? Why's that? Actually, I welcome that ALSA does quite a lot in
userspace, it could even do more. The whole format conversion and
sampling rate conversion has no business in the kernel, IMO.

Agreed. It took me quite some time to get my app ported, even though I
had lots of documentation and sample code...

Also agreed. It is IMO the hardest kernel subsystem to read. Instead of
having control passing from VFS to driver and the driver calling core
library routines, control passes from VFS to alsa core, which is calling
lots of callbacks. It's a coding style that should be avoided, it makes
reading and understanding code extremely hard.

Why is that? Even with kernel space mixing, any application having
access to the soundcard can fuck up the output, so I don't see why the
user space solution is less secure than a kernel solution.
