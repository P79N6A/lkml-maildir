Because stack memory management is so simple - all memory above the
stack pointer is assumed to be free.  (Or below, depending
on which way the stack grows.)  You allocate more
simply by incrementing the stack pointer, and free memory by
decrementing it.  Such a structure isn�'t trivially shareable!
Heaps on the other hand, have more complex memory management.
You call into a routine, such as malloc() to reserve memory
there.  Having several threads doing so simultaneosuly is not
a problem, so there is no need for separate heaps.  Separate heaps
would waste memory, as the threads might have very different needs
for memory.  Sharing is better, when possible.
If you want separate memory for each thread, consider separate processes
instead.
