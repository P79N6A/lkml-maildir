const functions are those that don't have side effects and depend
only on their argument list. So such functions can be CSE'ed or
reordered.
If it makes sense to use on any inline function, then I think it
makes sense if they're only using asm. Actually I would have thought
it would *only* help inline functions using asm, because gcc may
not know that such asm is 'const'.
But that's not to say they should be removed just because they
can't help gcc - it may be instructive to the programmer, or more
robust when making modifications to the code (eg. uninlining).
