I've been testing this patch on my systems.  It's working for me when
I read() a file.  Asynchronous write()s seem okay, too.  However,
synchronous writes (caused by either calling fsync() or fcntl() to
release a lock) prevent the process from being killed when the NFS
server goes down.
When the process is sent SIGKILL, it's waiting with the following call
tree:
    do_fsync
    nfs_fsync
    nfs_wb_all
    nfs_sync_mapping_wait
    nfs_wait_on_requests_locks (I believe)
    nfs_wait_on_request
    out_of_line_wait_on_bit
    __wait_on_bit
    nfs_wait_bit_interruptible
    schedule
When the process is later viewed after being deemed "stuck", it's
waiting with the following call tree:
    do_fsync
    filemap_fdatawait
    wait_on_page_writeback_range
    wait_on_page_writeback
    wait_on_page_bit
    __wait_on_bit
    sync_page
    io_schedule
    schedule
If I hazard a guess as to what might be wrong here, I believe that when
the processes catches SIGKILL, nfs_wait_bit_interruptible is returning
-ERESTARTSYS.  That error bubbles back up to nfs_fsync.  However,
nfs_fsync returns ctx->error, not -ERESTARTSYS, and ctx->error is 0.
do_fsync proceeds to call filemap_fdatawait.  I question whether 
nfs_sync should return an error, and if do_fsync should skip 
filemap_fdatawait if the fsync op returned an error.
I did try replacing the call to sync_page in __wait_on_bit with 
sync_page_killable and replacing TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE with 
TASK_KILLABLE.  That seemed to work once, but then really screwed things 
up on subsequent attempts.
