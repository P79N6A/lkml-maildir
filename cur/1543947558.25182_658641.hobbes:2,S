NAK.  For one thing, you need dependencies or selects and none of the
patches later in the series introduces them.  For another, neither
dependencies nor selects work well if you have non-modular users of
that sucker.  Seriously, try to add those and do allmodconfig.  Then
look what a mess it produces.
