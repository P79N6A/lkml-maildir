Yes. I really think we need to revert that patch, we just can't fix this 
any other way in the short run - the "request_irq/free_irq()" thing has 
broken too many setups. And we _need_ an answer for the short run, since I 
want to be able to release 2.6.13 without having lots of peoples laptop 
suspends be broken.
Yes, I realize that it fixed suspend for some people, but the thing is,
anything that expects lots of drivers to change just is fundamentally
broken. In a perfect world we might be able to get all drivers to do the
right thing, but dammit, in a perfect world we wouldn't have ACPI in the
first place.
So I guess I'll just have to revert the ACPI change that caused drivers to
do request_irq/free_irq. I'd prefer it if the ACPI people did that revert 
themselves, though.
