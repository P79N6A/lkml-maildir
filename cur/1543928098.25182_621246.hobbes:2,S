Hello everyone,
The deadline for position statements to the Linux Storage and
Filesystem Workshop is quickly approaching.  The position statements
are an easy way for you to tell the organizers that you would like to
attend, and which topics you are most interesting in.
You can find all the details about the workshop here:
http://www.usenix.org/events/lsf08/
The Linux Storage and Filesystem Workshop is a small, tightly focused,
by-invitation workshop. It is intended to bring together developers and
researchers interested in implementing improvements in the Linux
filesystem and storage subsystems that can find their way into the
mainline kernel and into Linux distributions in the 1–2 year timeframe.
The workshop will be two days and will be separated into storage and
filesystem tracks, with some combined plenary sessions.
The workshop will be held Feb 25 and 26 in San Jose.
