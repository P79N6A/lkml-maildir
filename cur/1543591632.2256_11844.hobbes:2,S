hi,
i created a 10mb file called .enc2 with random data and ran "# losetup -e
serpent -k 128 /dev/loop0 /mnt/hda7/.enc2"
then i ran "# mke2fs /dev/loop0" and tried to "# mount /dev/loop0 /enc". but
i get the following error messages when trying to mount:
May 19 21:32:10 HOST2 kernel: EXT2-fs error (device loop(7,0)):
ext2_check_descriptors: Block bitmap for group 16 not in group (block 0)!
May 19 21:32:10 HOST2 kernel: EXT2-fs: group descriptors corrupted !
im using kernel 2.4.4 patched with crypto patch 2.4.3.1 [and util linux
2.11a patched with the patch from that crypto patch]
i also got the same errors with a 2gb file and by creating the loop device
directly on my 19.5gb /dev/hda7
i tried a few times again and sometimes the encrypted loopback fs works
perfectly, sometimes the error occurs!?
anyone got an idea what this is!? i will supply more information on request
thx for your help
