Hello,
After I upgraded to 2.6.3 from 2.4.20 I discovered that I can only get 1 
dummy device. I need to be able to load 3 dummy network devices. 
Scouring the kernel archives, it looks like this can be accomplished 
through MODULE_PARAMS, but I can find no information on the 
module_params are or how to use them. I have dummy built as a module and 
it does load at startup as dummy0. How do I get dummy1 and dummy2?
In answering this message, please CC me.
Thanks for your help,
Rick Knight
