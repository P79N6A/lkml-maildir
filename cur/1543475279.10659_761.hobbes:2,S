Subject: tulip.c and VIA VP3 crashes

	Okay, I tried tulip.c v0.89H as suggested by Alan and others on
the mailing list. I can now say that even this one still crashes my
computer using kernel 2.1.131-ac10 (which is totally stable on my machine
when not using the tulip driver) -and- Red Hat's 2.0.35. So it not just a
bad interaction between the newer tulip code and the rest of the 2.1.xx
system that is buggy. It's probably something to do with my VIA VP3
chipset and the tulip code as I got email from someone else with a VIA
motherboard and getting crashes with tulip.c.
	I will now try to trade my NetGear rev D card (with the Lite-On
PNIC tulip clone chip) with a NetGear rev C card from work (has the real
DEC chip) and see if that crashes even under tulip.c v0.83. I'll let you
know the results.
