I agree.
This is -not- the situation now, and it will never be the situation.
Did you read drivers/net/Makefile.lib ?
Another example, take a look at drivers/video/Config.in.  We actually do
not need those hideously long if statements "if foofb or barfb or bazfb"...
Makefile rules clean that shit up nicely.

You are preaching to the choir.  ;-)

Close...  Check out this thread from December.  I agree with Linus
we need metadata files (driver.conf), not yanking all that info out
of the source code.

To sum, Makefile rules are better than Config.in garbage because it can
be far more modular, and more resistant to breakage.  But, for the
longer term, we want 8139too.conf and lance.conf and...
