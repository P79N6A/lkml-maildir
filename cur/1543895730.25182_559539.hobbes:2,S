All right, my patches are short of comments. So, I will add comments 
to the ambiguous codes.

After the target moves from target_list to temporary_list, 
the kobject_unregister() of possible raced target isn't called 
in ioctl(NETCON_REMOVE_TARGET) because the target_list doesn't contain 
the target .
I have the wrong idea?

Because I drew upon dev_change_name() method in net/core/dev.c.
The device_rename() in the above function makes use of same prefix 
related to netdev.

I drew upon dev_change_name() method in net/core/dev.c.
