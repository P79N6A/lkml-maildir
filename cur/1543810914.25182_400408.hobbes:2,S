Well, there is always the trick of making it a pointer.  It was needed 
for pselect() anyway.  A real sys_mmap64 would definitely have been 
cleaner, and will be needed to deal with the 16 TB barrier anyway :)
I personally think the S390 people had the right idea... once you run 
out of registers, just make it a defined part of the ABI that we pass in 
a single pointer to all the arguments.
