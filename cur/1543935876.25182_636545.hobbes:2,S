I know /usr/bin/tasklet is another way to set smp affinity of a task,
it uses the sched_{set,get}affinity system call binary interface, but
add a /proc/<pid>/smp_affinity could give a new choice; and this keeps
consistency with /proc/irq/<irq>/smp_affinity, will be familiar to
most people.
Another way, the sysctl system call binary interface has been marked
deprecated recently, only /proc/sys/ operating interface left; I
wonder this this would be a tendency of virtual filesystem interface
to replace binary interface? In my opinion, vfs text interface is
always better than system call binary interface.
