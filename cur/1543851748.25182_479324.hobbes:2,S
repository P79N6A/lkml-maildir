What other devices are routed to that same interrupt line?
The sata_qstor driver is very rigorous in acknowledging *only* it's own
interrupts, to prevent other devices sharing the same IRQ from losing theirs.
Mmm.. We could apply a bit of fuzzy tolerance for the odd glitch.
Try this patch (attached) and report back.
Thanks.
