In that case, maybe I should do repeated calls to a20_check with a
(not too big) retry count after the port 92 write ?
Problem is, it happens to work this way on all hardware I have access to,
so I can't really reproduce such timing problems. Anyone ?

??? I'm not touching the KBC if the port 92 access was successful at
enableing A20. If, however, A20 is still disabled, I'm doing the same KBC
sequence as the original code, so there shouldn't be any incomplete KBC
interactions (unless I mistyped something...).

That was exactly my intention :-)
