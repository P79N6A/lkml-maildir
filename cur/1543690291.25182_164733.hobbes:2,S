Hello,
I have got kernel 2.6.0-test5-mm1 on an Epox 8k9a9i Mainboard with
KT400A and an Nvidia FX5200 using the nvidia-module and drivers.
I use only onboard IDE and onboard ethernet.
I want to be able to use Suspend to RAM with my machine. I tried
APM and ACPI, both with no success. I also tried with no X11.
1.) APM:   (ACPI follows...)
apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x07 (Driver version 1.16ac)
Sep 10 12:02:55 localhost apmd[441]: Suspending now
Sep 10 12:02:55 localhost kernel: hdc: start_power_step(step: 0)
Sep 10 12:02:55 localhost kernel: hdc: completing PM request, suspend

I pressed the power button at the machines case, but it comes back to
life straight away. I also tried with apm --verbose --suspend and --standby,
but with no change.
2) ACPI
Thanks to Andrew de Quincey I can boot with ACPI without
problems and I can read out my temp and so on, but when I do
   echo -n "mem" >/sys/power/state 
the machine goes into sleep (STR) but crashes after waking up again.
And an
   echo -n "S3" > /proc/acpi/sleep 
doesn't work at all.
Also pressing the power button has NO effect. I think
it does not generate an event.
3) Questions
What can I do to get STR working straight?
Are these some stupid non-powersaving-aware drivers?
What makes my system wake up from apm suspend? How to debug?
I can see the CPU temp with ACPI, but how do I see the case temp?
Do I need to change things in the system BIOS or does linux ignore that?
Bye, claas
