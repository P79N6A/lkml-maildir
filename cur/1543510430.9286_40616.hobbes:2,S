(this is just a warning, the kernel fixes it up afterwards, so there is no
problem. I'd suggest to print a '... FIXED' type of thing too, to not
confuse people.)
a related thing, if you boot smp-2.3.18-F8, does it say anything about TSC
skew? BIOSes that get the MTRRs wrong usually get the TSC wrong as well.
