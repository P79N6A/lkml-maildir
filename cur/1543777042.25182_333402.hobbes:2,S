Hi.  I think that viewing tracing tools like LTT and systemtap as
strictly kernel debug tools is very short-sighted.  With a good
post-processing tool, tracing is very useful to application developers
who can benefit by visualizing the interaction between user-level tasks
and the OS as well as the synchronization of multiple tasks/threads.
IOW, tracing is in many ways an _application_ debug tool, not a _kernel_
debug tool.  And application developers usually do not want to run a
debug kernel.
I would like to see relayfs merged.
