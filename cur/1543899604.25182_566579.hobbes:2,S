Welcome to the kernel 2.6 development model.

WTF are you talking about?
Both drivers only support PCI cards.

The goal is to get e100 better, and removing eepro100 helps with 
reaching this goal.
Why didn't _you_ try the e100 driver when you validated your systems 
after you upgraded them to kernel 2.6, and if you did and it didn't 
work, where is your bug report?
