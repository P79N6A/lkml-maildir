I got 2M pages working in lguest64, but it was a cause of a lot of pain.
By removing support for 2M pages in guests, that might clean up a lot of
lguest64 shadow paging as well.
The only advantage I see for 2M pages or a guest, is that it saves the
guest from having extra page tables. The host still needs the map the 2M
to 4K, so it's not an advantage there. It doesn't speed anything up, so
I'd be all for scrapping 2M pages for guests.
