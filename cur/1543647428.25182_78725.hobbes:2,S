	Hello All ,
	Here we go .  Two differant hardware types to prevent users from
	making private backups of items that they have purchased .  I hope
	that somewhere in the community there is a methodology to
	circumvent this stupidity .
	Below is a snippet from the URL below this :
	Why are there two formats? The key reason for the introduction of
	DVD-R for General media is that it contains content protection
	measures that make it physically impossible to make a bit-for-bit
	copies of CSS encrypted entertainment titles.
