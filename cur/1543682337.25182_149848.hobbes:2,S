As incentive for other folks to think about the solution I haven't been 
able to come up with, I think I'll post what I do about it here, and 
threaten to submit it for inclusion ;-) ...

... just as soon as I get my decidedly unclean work-around functioning at 
least as well as it did for plain old irman.   irman2 is _much_ more evil 
than irman ever was (wow, good job!).  I thought it'd be a half an hour 
tops.  This little bugger shows active starvation, expired starvation, 
priority inflation, _and_ interactive starvation (i have to keep inventing 
new terms to describe things i see.. jeez this is a good testcase).
