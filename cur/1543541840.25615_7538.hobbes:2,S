Ehh.. They already are.
And we _should_ expose to user space some way that files are linked. The
HFS behaviour where you cannot even tell whether it's a resource or
another filesystem that just happens to have that particular layout is not
giving people useful information.
Quite frankly, "tar" is not that big a deal. It can be extended upon. I
don't see why people keep harping on that issue.
I understand the "emulate the HFS layout on another filesystem for file
serving" gripe better, but I don't see that it is unreasonable to have a
HFS fileserver know whether the thing it is exporting is natively HFS or
not. The "regular filesystem emulation" might as well be done there,
instead of going the other way around.
