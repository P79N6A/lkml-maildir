Let me remind you, what you said which prompted Linus to reply in the
first place:
	"if Marcelo would be using open source code to exports the
	 patchsets in"
This is flame bait.  The only thing a sentence like that will do is
spark a flame and incite emotional responses from others, not
constructive conversation.
That is what you need to stop doing.
