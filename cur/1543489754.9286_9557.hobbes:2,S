        I just noticed a peculiar effect while building some bootable
    images for some CD's.  I have the boot image mounted over the loopback
    file system and copy some files to the image and unmount the image.
    I noticed that the modification time on the boot image was not changed
    even though the file was!
        Example:
    ] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# ls -l boot.cd 
    ] -r--r--r--   1 root     root      2949120 Mar 12 13:26 boot.cd
    ] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# sum boot.cd 
    ] 61897  2880
    ] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# mount boot.cd /mnt/cdrom -t msdos -o loop=/dev/loop1
(btw: the `=/dev/loop1' is usually superfluous)
    ] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# gzip -9 < initrd.img > /mnt/cdrom/initrd.img
    ] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# umount /mnt/cdrom/
    ] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# sum boot.cd 
    ] 28152  2880
    ] chaos:/u/cdrom/build# ls -l boot.cd 
    ] -r--r--r--   1 root     root      2949120 Mar 12 13:26 boot.cd
        Shouldn't the timestamp have been updated?
No, this is precisely as expected.
[After the loop mount, boot.cd is comparable to /dev/hda1.
We do not keep track of the date and time of the last change
to a filesystem. It would be a reasonable thing to do,
but usually wasted effort since there is no place to store it.
{ext2 already maintains the last time the superblock was written}
Maybe later.]
