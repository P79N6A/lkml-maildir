Hi,
actually, my first patch wasn't using weak symbols, but I have been 
convinced that it's the way to go(tm). Please see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/1/131
 and the ongoing thread.
I am fine with replacing the brk randomization patch with the one that 
wasn't using weak symbols (posted in the mentioned thread too), I have no 
strong opinion either way.
Thanks,
