I can confirm this,...
booting with mem=2G => works fine,...
(all of the following tests were made with memory hole mapping=hardware
in the BIOS,.. so I could access my full ram):
booting with iommu=soft => works fine
booting with iommu=noagp => DOESN'T solve the error
booting with iommu=off => the system doesn't even boot and panics
When I set IOMMU to disabled in the BIOS the error is not solved-
I tried to set bigger space for the IOMMU in the BIOS (256MB instead of
64MB),.. but it does not solve the problem.
Any ideas why iommu=disabled in the bios does not solve the issue?

1) And does this now mean that there's an error in the hardware (chipset
or CPU/memcontroller)?

Yes I can absolutely confirm this...
Do my additional tests help you?
Do you have any ideas why the issue doesn't occur (even with memhole
mapping=hardware in the bios and no iommu=soft at kernel command line)
when dma is disabled for the disks (or a slower dma mode is used)?
Chris.
