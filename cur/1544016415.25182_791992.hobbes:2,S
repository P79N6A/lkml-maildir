The problem is there was apparently no plan for resolving the SLAB vs SLUB
strategy. And then features and things were added to one or the other one.
But on the other hand, the SLUB experience was a success in a way because
there were a lot of performance regressions found and fixed after it was
merged, for example.
I'd love to be able to justify replacing SLAB and SLUB today, but actually
it is simply never going to be trivial to discover performance regressions.
So I don't think outright replacement is great either (consider if SLUB
had replaced SLAB completely).

Sure. On the slab side, I would be happy to do that work.
We split the user base, which is a big problem if it drags out for years
like SLAB/SLUB. But if it is a very deliberate use of testing resources
in order to make progress on the issue, then that can be a positive.

I hit problems on some microbenchmark where I was prefetching a NULL pointer in
some cases, which must have been causing the CPU to trap internally and alloc
overhead suddenly got much higher ;) 
Possibly sometimes if you prefetch too early or when various queues are
already full, then it ends up causing slowdowns too.

That's true, OTOH if the time between allocations is large, then an
extra prefetch is just a small cost. If the time between them is
short, it might be a bigger win.
