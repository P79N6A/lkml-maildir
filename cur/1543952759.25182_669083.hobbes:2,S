I did some more testing, and realized I was wrong. We need to totally
undo everything we've done to ec.c since -rc5... (that has small
sideffect of brightness up/down keys no longer working -- regression
since 2.6.24, but saves us from "backlight gone after
closing/reopening lid" which is _NASTY_ regression from 2.6.25-rc5).
ACPI sucks.
I.e. this patch:
Revert ec.c to 2.6.25-rc5 state:
* this fixes backlight after closing/reopening the lid while in X on
thinkpad x60
* unfortunately it breaks fn-home/end keyboard brightness control
