Hi,
	After installing 2.5.48, I see lots and lots of messages like these:
Nov 19 20:17:24 wombat rpc.mountd: authenticated mount request from xterm.chubb.wattle.id.au:916 for /usr/local/xenginenew/fonts/misc (/usr) 
Nov 19 20:17:24 wombat rpc.mountd: getfh failed: Operation not permitted 
These weren't there in 2.5.44. What's changed?
xterm uses version 2 NFS; /etc/exports says:
..
/usr	*.chubb.wattle.id.au(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
..
/usr is ext2:
$ mount
/dev/sda5 on /usr type ext2 (rw)
If I add the `insecure' option things work again; but this didn't used
to be necessary.  And the log shows it coming in on port 916, anyway.
