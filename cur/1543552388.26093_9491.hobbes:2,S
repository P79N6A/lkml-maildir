Not just a preprocessor change.

This is true for a correct compiler (ever seen a correct piece of
software?)  compiling strictly standard-conforming source. The kernel is
_not_ standard-conforming, and many places are writen just like they are to
trick the compiler into generating particular code, some places assume that
undefined behaviour (i.e., a[i] = b[i++] and such) works in a certain way,
that the compiler pads structures in a certain way, ...

Yes. The existing program is wrong in that it woprked by chance, not
because it was written right.
