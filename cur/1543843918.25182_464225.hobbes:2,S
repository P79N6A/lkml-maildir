Final note (I promise): now that we save/restore eflags again, we 
should probably revert the set_iopl_mask() in task switching too. However, 
that apparently has some para-virtualization issues, so I'm going to 
ignore that part from now.
However, I'd really like people who know and care about the 
paravirtualization to take a good long look at it: because right now, with 
the addition of the eflags save/restore, the set_iopl_mask() in 
__switch_to() is entirely useless for non-virtualized environments, afaik.
Zack added to the cc. Who else needs to know?
