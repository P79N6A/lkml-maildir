True, but one  generally wants to avoid suid tools that are visible
inside of CLONE_NS environment.  Ideally, one uses per-vfsmount
ro,nodev,nosuid for mounts within such an environment.
How does mount(8) access its configuration information from within the
namespace?  That requires that part of the private namespace be secured,
which is a non-trivial limitation, if one wants to, e.g., grant the
vserver administrator full privileges.
Alternatively, one might run a mount server within the environment.
That's certainly doable with existing infrastructure.
