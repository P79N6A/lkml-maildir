That's probably because your old config file was relatively recent, and
had things like CONFIG_BLK_DEV=y in it.
But those people who are still dragging around old config files which
predate the introduction of CONFIG_BLK_DEV will find that 2.6.22-rc6-mm1
oldconfig will give them CONFIG_BLK_DEV=n instead of current mainline's
deafult of CONFIG_BLK_DEV=y.
I think making BLK_DEV deafult to n was a bit dumb, so I dropped the
offending patches.
