Note that more notification record types is actually where latest 
hardware is going: for example in Nehalem there's a PEBS notification 
record type that has cachemiss latency included in the record. I.e. we 
can get profiles with _cachemiss latency_ included (as measured from 
issuing the instruction to completion).
You cannot get that information out of any 'stop the task' interface ...
Stopping a task is way too intrusive, i dont know why you keep harping on 
it. Listen to the scheduler guys: it's a non-starter.

You try to ridicule our efforts, while you have not answered our 
technical arguments in substance.
Please let me repeat: it's a _fundamental_ thesis of performance 
instrumentation to not disturb the monitored context. Your insistence on 
_stopping_ the monitored task breaks that fundamental axiom!
Stopping a task destroys the characteristics of many, many workloads. To 
get a reasonable histogram out of a system a highlevel event count of 
thousands a second is desired (but hundreds of them are a minimum, to get 
any reasonable coverage).
But injecting even hundreds of artificialy task-stoppages will destroy 
the true behavior of many reference workloads we care about in Linux!
Stopping the task is a fundamental and obvious design failure of perfmon.
