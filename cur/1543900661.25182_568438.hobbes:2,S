The lack of an address space seems to make them rather different too.  A
process contains address space, and one or more threads.  A thread is
hence a component of a process, but not really similar to a process
since it is just part of a process.

You are switching out cpu registers, stack, and such, even though you
are not changing address space, so you are doing a context switch.  The
cpu registers and state is the context.  Running multiple threads of a
single process in a row can avoid messing with the TLB and other address
space related things, but it still switches context.
