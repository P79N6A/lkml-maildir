I'm currently on RedHat 6.2 on the system in question, and I have the
xntp3-5.93-14.i386.rpm package installed. I can only comment on that as
a result.

The following is the start of my /etc/ntp.conf file, so perhaps you can
compare it to yours and advise if it looks anywhere near similar...
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
# Remote systems I am authorised to synchronise to.
#
server	ntp4.cs.strath.ac.uk
#
# Undisciplined Local Clock. This is a fake driver intended for backup
# and when no outside source of synchronized time is available. The
# default stratum is usually 3, but in this case we elect to use stratum
# 10. Since the server line does not have the prefer keyword, this
# driver is never used for synchronization, unless no other other
# synchronization source is available. In case the local host is
# controlled by some external source, such as an external oscillator or
# another protocol, the prefer keyword would cause the local host to
# disregard all other synchronization sources, unless the kernel
# modifications are in use and declare an unsynchronized condition.
#
server	127.127.1.0		# local clock
fudge	127.127.1.0 stratum 10	
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
The lines starting with '#' are comments describing the reasons for the
choices in question, and this is the only interesting part of the
configuration file as far as this discussion is concerned.
The first server line specifies the clock source to be used when I'm
online, this one being at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, and
is one that I have obtained permission to use. As nothing else is given,
it stands at stratum 2 (as obtained on request from the timeserver
itself).
The second server line specifies 127.127.1.0 which is the address that
ntp associates with the local RTC clock. The fudge line that follows
specifies that this is to stand at stratum 10, and thus that it is
considerably less reliable than the first server line. It therefore gets
ignored when the first listed server is available, and is only used if
nothing better can be contacted.

If it does, what adjusts it?

The kernel itself never writes to the RTC, and that is one of Linus's
decisions with which I am in 100% agreeance (and one thing I hate about
Windows). In fact, the kernel itself also doesn't read from the RTC
either, but leaves that to userspace.

That's possible. However, I'd start by grep'ing your bootup and shutdown
scripts for lines containing the word 'clock' either on its own or as
part of a longer word, where those lines are not comments. If you have a
RedHat distribution, then...
 Q> find /etc -type f | xargs fgrep clock /dev/null | fgrep -v ':#'
...will give you a list of possibilities. Go through these and check
what each one is doing, and if any are SETTING the RTC, then comment
them out. Let me know whether that cures your problem. The reason for
this is that the standard RTC setting programmes are `clock` and
`hwclock` and either can be told to copy the current system time into
the RTC.

If it's not the above, please advise what you find.
Best wishes from Riley.
