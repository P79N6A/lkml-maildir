Umm?
 "Could you try to kill 'init' and see how long your machine survives
  without running out of processes due to processes getting stuck in
  zombie state?"
If you kill the update deamon, your screwed.  Don't do it.  If you do
it, whatever happens is your own fault, and you only have yourself to
blame. 
So your whole point is meaningless.
