No, except maybe my last patch that actually limits lowmem to 512Mb ;)
I don't think we use the io mapping BATs any more, do we ? (well,
maybe on PReP...) I don't on pmac.

No, nor on any other BAT-capable PPC (and that's the reason why I
did the above). Basically, our exception return path and some of
the hash manipulation functions aren't safe without BAT mapping,
especially on SMP when you can get evicted from the hash table
by the other CPU in places where taking hash faults isn't safe.
