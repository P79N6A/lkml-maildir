* Hi Linus,
* 
* the appended patch exports the syscalls (GPL-limited), this is needed
* for the Linux-ABI modules so they can use the syscalls in their
* syscall tables for non-Linux personalities.
What is the rationale for marking these as GPL-exclusive symbols ? 
I thought system calls were a public interface.
