So your GUI apps will have to do everything for you, cause they can't call
command-line tools to do the job.
You know what Un*x philosophy is about?
I'll tell you: Having a lot of small, clean, flexible tools, which you can
combine to get what you want, either on the command line or by a GUI using
them.
So what you ask for is this 1GB Mega Office app doing everything in one
place. You want to reinvent W*n and its style of apps and have these on
Un*x. Forget it!
