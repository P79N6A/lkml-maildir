For use cases such as embedded firmware, the limitations are
non-interesting, and the compression savings are very interesting.
Especially where the resulting filesystem has to creep through slow
wires such as half duplex serial links etc.
Have been using squashfs 2.2 up to 3.4 without problems for years, for
distribution of Linux based firmwares into embedded devices.
Many thanks for your continued efforts on mainlining squashfs,
Regards,
