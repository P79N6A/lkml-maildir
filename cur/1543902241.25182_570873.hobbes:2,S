It seems my explanation was not enough.
We (like me, usually not using English) can read English but it takes
more time than you (and any natives). So, reading large document takes
huge amount of time. In case of htmldocs, it is actually large and
developer may give up before start.
I thought that if some part (like how to do it) are translated into
his/her familiar language, he/she may not give it up.
Yes, it may not be.
Another viewpoint is that if he/she need to modify some interface and
it may need to change some part of extractable document, this file
includes, "How to add extractable documentation to your source files".
It will be some help as well. 
Yes, He/she should write English and it may take long time but hopefully
the translation result would push his/her back.
