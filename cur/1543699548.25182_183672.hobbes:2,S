Ah, it's finals week.  It's nice to vent a little steam and take a break from 
failing to get my Educational Psychology and Economics of Technology papers 
in on time. :)
Sorry if I came down a bit hard.  I type fast, and I've had a backlog of 
stress this week.  (I know I had a reason for going back to grad school.  I 
wonder what it was?)
