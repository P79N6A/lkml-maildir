   In times of sun keyboards and usb keyboards, keyboard raw mode has
   no longer good sense. People already had problems with it on
   powerpc: system then behaves different if you use different kind of
   keyboard. We should better let world know raw mode is doomed to
   dead.
Ummm... doesn't the X server use RAW mode exclusively?
