That fails if:
the module function has called somewhere else in the kernel (and
with -fomit-frame-pointer, you can't reliably walk back up the stack
to find out if there is a stack frame higher up the stack which is in
the module);
the module has taken an interrupt into an unrelated driver;
we have computed a call into the module but haven't actually executed
the call yet;
etc.

Without freezing the other CPUs, that still leaves the race wide open.
