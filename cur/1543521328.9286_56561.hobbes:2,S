   Sparc's mmap2() consists of:
	   /* Make sure the shift for mmap2 is constant (12), no matter what PAGE_SIZE
	      we have. */
	   return do_mmap2(addr, len, prot, flags, fd, pgoff >> (PAGE_SHIFT - 12));
   What happens if you have an 8K page size (PAGE_SHIFT == 13), and the
   user supplies an odd number in pgoff?
He won't because he obtained sys_getpagesize() first and used that
to make sure his pgoff argument was page aligned.
