Well 2.6.18's scx200_acb works on the geode LX module I have, but no on
the geode sc1200 module (where scx200_i2c does work).
scx200_acb doesn't detect any device that it can drive (nothing in dmesg
at all when loaded) on the sc1200.  I believe the main changes that
happened to scx200_acb was adding support for the newer CSxxxx chipsets,
such as the one used with the geode LX (which does work now).
