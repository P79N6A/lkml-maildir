Here's what I once wrote in Modem-HOWTO:
  Most modems are designed to be connected only to telephone lines and
  will not work over just a pair of wires.  This is because the
  telephone company supplies the telephone line with a 40-50 volt DC
  voltage which powers part of the modem.  Recall that ordinary
  conventional telephones are entirely powered by the voltage from the
  telephone company.  Without such a DC voltage, the modem lacks power
  and can't send out data.  Furthermore, the telephone company has
  special signals indicating a ring, line busy, etc.  Conventional
  modems expect and respond to these signals.
  One way around this is to make a simple power supply to emulate a
  telephone line.  See Connecting two computers using their modems,
  without a telephone line <
http://www.jagshouse.com/modem.html>.
  In
  most cases there are better way to connect computers together such as
  using network cards or just cables (null-modem) between the serial
  ports.  Using modems has the advantage of increasing the distance as
  compared to a null-modem cable, since it's using a twisted pair.  But
  it isn't nearly as fast as network cards.
