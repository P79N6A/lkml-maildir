Hello:
Is it possible to arrange that a Linux application 
(or one of its threads) has the ability to
	"... lock (a certain) stack and data segment ... 
	into memory so that it can't be swapped out"?
[This has been formulated as a requirement by one of 
our analysts.]
I have been told that this is unlikely (except by 
disabling swapout altogether (for all processes). 
Any hints as to where to look for a solution (i.e., 
pointers to documentation or manuals where the ifs 
and hows are explained) would be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks in advance,
F.P.Weber
