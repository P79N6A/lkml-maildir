Hi,
We have run pre15 with mercelo's patch since yesterday 
(pre16 was out this night, we will patch it this afternoon)
I have a littel problem with thoses process:
root      6795  0.0  0.0  1344  116 pts/5    D    11:01   0:00 nslookup ns9
root      7200  0.0  0.0  1332  312 pts/0    D    11:02   0:00 nslookup ns9
root      7984  0.0  0.0  1332  312 pts/6    D    11:04   0:00 nslookup ns8
root      9232  0.0  0.0  1332  312 pts/7    D    11:06   0:00 nslookup ns9
I killed named and restarted it. nothing
I killed lot of process, but the memory "used" is still high.
Since it is not taking CPU, I will not reboot the server.
So if you have any idea to fix it.
thx
Octave
