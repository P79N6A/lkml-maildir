Some good news here. :-)
If the kernel is booted with pci=routeirq and nmi_watchdog=0, almost all of 
the problems that I had with swsusp "magically" disappear.
One issue that remains is a USB-related crash (trace available at: 
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/040911/swsusp-usb-trace.log
), which does not 
prevent the box from waking up (as you can see in the trace), but requires 
the ohci_hcd module to be reloaded.  I have got rid of it by compiling the 
USB drivers into the kernel.
The second remaining "thing" is that the network interface on eth0 (sk98lin) 
does not come up properly after resume and I have to restart networking to 
make it work, but this is a non-issue.
Thanks a lot for your help, and if I can do something for you (like testing 
new code etc.), please let me know.
Greets,
RJW
