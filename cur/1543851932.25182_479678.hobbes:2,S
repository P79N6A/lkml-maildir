Both of the patches below were already available when 2.6.19-rc4 was 
released.
The DVB patch was was sent as part of a DVB update Linus didn't pull for 
unknown reasons.
The s390 patch seems to await being forwarded by the s390 maintainers.
This email lists some known regressions in 2.6.19-rc4 compared to 2.6.18
with patches available.
If you find your name in the Cc header, you are either submitter of one
of the bugs, maintainer of an affectected subsystem or driver, a patch
of you caused a breakage or I'm considering you in any other way
possibly involved with one or more of these issues.
Due to the huge amount of recipients, please trim the Cc when answering.
