This is on kernel 2.6.11, mdadm 1.4.0
The system has MD devices that are auto-configured on boot.
However, there are also devices connected via another SCSI adapter
(actually, a Qlogic QLA2300). I'm using a module for that. As the
auto-configure only runs at boot (or rather, when the md subsystem is
started).  I wanted to restart a raid-0 device that I had previously
created. I did:
	mdadm --run /dev/md10
as a simple attempt to see what would happen. What happened was the
error message in the subject, and a "COMPLETE RAID STATE PRINTOUT"...
In that output there is a line "md10:", the next line is
"md1: <sde1><sdd1><sdc1><sdb1><sda1>".
Admittedly the usage may be wrong, but having the kernel say "bug" can't
be right :-)
