   >From what I recall when we were looking into reiserfs on S/390,
   the core problem was that reiserfs tried to do *atomic* operations
   on non-aligned words.  This isn't supported by the hardware on
   S/390 (normal non-aligned accesses just work).
   I don't really see how this can be fixed in a trap handler; how
   would the handler guarantee atomicity?
Oh thats different!  That won't even work %100 correctly on x86.  On
x86 it will "execute", but it won't be atomic.
Why the F*CK does it need to do this?  It sounds like sloppy
programming to me.
