All drives I bought in the recent years shipped with ARRE and ARWE set.
Any halfway decent fsck tool can just rewrite the b0rked sector and the
drive transparently remaps a spare.
If reiser4 crashes the kernel instead, it's not failure resilient and is
certainly not ready for production.

...and certainly a backup system that gives you FAST access to the data.
RAID doesn't protect against accidents with rm(1) or, worse, wipe(1).
