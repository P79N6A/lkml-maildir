Well, the devicescape port of the bcm43xx driver works
very relieably on my Apple PowerBook with WPA encryption.
(WEP does also work).
I don't think there are lots of issues left for non-AccessPoint

instead of rendering your expensive notebook into an AP. ;)
It's been a long time, since I plugged my ethernet cable into
the notebook the last time... .
