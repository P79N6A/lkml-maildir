I have a pretty old but still very usable machine using a Symbios Logic 
53c810 SCSI card that started spewing out these messages in kernel 2.6.6:
Jun 17 11:36:21 localhost kernel: sym0:0:0:M_REJECT to send for : 1-2-3-1.
Jun 17 11:36:52 localhost last message repeated 159 times
Jun 17 11:36:59 localhost last message repeated 11 times
Over and over again. 2.6.5 didn't do this. I hoped 2.6.7 would fix it, 
but apparently it doesn't. Information on the card:
00:0a.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c810 (rev 11)
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV+ VGASnoop- 
ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- 
<TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 64 (2000ns min, 16000ns max), cache line size 08
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 5
        Region 0: I/O ports at b400 [size=256]
        Region 1: Memory at e4000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
it's configered in .config as:
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2=y
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_DMA_ADDRESSING_MODE=1
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS=16
CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_MAX_TAGS=64
# CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_IOMAPPED is not set
Does anyone have pointers to stop this?
TIA,
Vincent
