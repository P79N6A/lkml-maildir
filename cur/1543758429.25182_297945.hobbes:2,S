As connector author, I still doubt it worth copying several lines 
from netlink_broadcast() before skb allocation in cn_netlink_send().
Of course it is easy and can be done, but I do not see any profit here.
Atomic allocation is fast, if it succeds,  but there are no groups/socket to send,
skb will be freed, if allocation fails, then group check is useless.
I would prefer Guillaume Thouvenin as fork connector author to test
his current implementation and show that connector's cost is negligible
both with and without userspace listeners.
As far as I remember it is first entry in fork connector's TODO list.
