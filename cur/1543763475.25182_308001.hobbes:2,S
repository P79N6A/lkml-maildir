Almost every attribute can be dangerous if set incorrectly. Bot it is 
really no problem - simply let's turn to fat12 as root filesystem, and 
no attribute will be dangerous any more... See that acl-s also are not 
used for every file, only for some files, ones of thousands files in the 
filesystem. They are not set and reset every ten minutes - they are set 
one time and used, used and used. The same applies to nice attribute. Is 
it dangerous to not modify attribute all the time? And why restricted 
access is riskfull and evil? If restriction of sccess makes system more 
vurnable to attacks, maybe the good solution will be to set 755 
attributes on enery inode (expecially /etc/shadow) - then everyone will 
be able to do everything and system as whole will be more secure...
I really don't catch your mind.
