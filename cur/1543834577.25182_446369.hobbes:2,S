I believe you are referring to the "oops in bttv" thread.
As i understood, the case that Alex reported in was a null pointer issue 
due to which modprobe bttv crashes, rather than a DVB issue.
Call Trace:
  [<c018763c>] sysfs_create_file+0x26/0x28
  [<c0220cc3>] class_device_create_file+0x14/0x1a
  [<f9bc3073>] bttv_register_video+0x8c/0x147 [bttv]
  [<f9bc35de>] bttv_probe+0x4ab/0x593 [bttv]
Therefore the V4L fixes should probably fix the same as well.
Regards,
Manu
