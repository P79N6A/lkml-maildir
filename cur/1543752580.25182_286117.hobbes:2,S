Hello,
I'd like to know if it's easy to write a RAID like device for tapes (RAIT)...
For block devices, hooks are present in the kernel code, but for char devices, 
is there a way to implement a write function for example, which will write in 
parallel to N /dev/stX tape devices ?
RAIT already exists in Amanda, in user space, but I'd like to see a generic 
kernel RAIT driver which could be used by any backup program.
Cheers,
