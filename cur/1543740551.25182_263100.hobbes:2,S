A triggers B to exit and must wait until B has exited. It waits for
completion of exit.
A triggers B to execute a command and must wait until B has done so.  It
waits for completion of the command.
Mutexes are used for that, but that's not the intended functionality of
a mutex. Of course it works as long as you do no owner checks on the
mutexes.
A {
	init_MUTEX_LOCKED(m)
	trigger B
	down(m)	<----- recursion, because A owns it already
}
The completion is designed for that and should be used IMHO. Mutexe were
used for that, because the ancestors of completion, sleep_on...(), are
racy.
