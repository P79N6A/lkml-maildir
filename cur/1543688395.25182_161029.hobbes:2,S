/proc/ide/foo/identify is another (and tools rely on that working
without ide-cd/ide-disk etc loaded btw) [HP monitoring tools for one]

Because you need to manipulate drives not attached to a driver
currently. I guess you could go through hoops to avoid it, but the
old IDE driver was just full of bugs that ide_default removed,
and it removed rather more code than it added.
You also need to be able to open the device to talk to the empty
slot about reprobing it, changing the bus state or even figuring
what driver is missing.

You need the unplugged_ops for controller unplug, I'm more worried about
disk unplug (which I have working now). For controller unplug you either
have to know that ide_unregister does not ever return until the device
is truely idle - including interrupts, proc access currently running
etc. If so then notionally you can handle it without the unplugged ops
although they certainly make it safer.
I don't know what the constraints on PCI hotplug are but I don't believe
anything will run off and reuse the resources after an unplug event,
although your accesses might generate machine checks (non fatal) on IA64
etc.

My own feeling is that its a lot easier than trying to catch all the 
corner cases ide_default fixed, especially when you do drive level
hotplug. If the IDE code was glorious and elegant, refcounted and with
a clear life cycle of objects I'd agree with you 8)
