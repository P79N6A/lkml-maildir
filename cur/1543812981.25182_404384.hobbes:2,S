It's the cumulative effect of the cpu used by the in kernel code paths and the 
kprefetchd kernel thread. Even running ultra low priority, if they read a lot 
from the hard drive it costs us cpu time (seen as I/O wait in top for 
example). Swap prefetch _never_ displaces anything from ram; it only ever 
reads things from swap if there is generous free ram available. Not only that 
but if it reads something from swap it is put at the end of the "least 
recently used" list meaning that if _anything_ needs ram, these are the first 
things displaced again.
