  Richard, should there be (is there?)  linux-networking-faq, or can this
  be put into the  linux-kernel  faq ?

   That book describes  BSD  implementation.
   Linux code has been written completely independently, and using
   fundamentally different base structure -- instead of PCBs containing
   chains of segments, Linux has  SKBs  with entire segment contiguous
   in it.
   Function, and structure names are different, naturally.
