Dick,
I should say that the malloc() succeeds, but the 16mb I need for the
buffer are not available.  Since there is no swap/page file in the
embedded environment, there isn't enough memory left afterwards for
the buffer.
After taking another look at the problem, the kernel has a lot of
memory tied up in the inode and dentry cache.   I've tuned
/proc/sys/vm/vm_cache_scan_ratio, vm_mapped_ratio, vm_vfs_scan_ratio
with no real success in shrinking the amount of memory used by these
caches.
Is there a way to tune and shring the overall amount of memory the
kernel attempts to use for the dentry/inode cache, or make it much,
much more aggressive at clearing it?
