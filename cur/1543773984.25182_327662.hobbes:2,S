imho, this is something different. Ext2 decides itself how to manage a
symlink depending on length of string the symlink is to store.
Reiser4 plugins are to allow a user to define himself which operations
file is to be managed with.

I do not think that it exists already.
You can have standart type of files and that is all.
Linux filesystem is not supposed to provide anything but plain
regular/directory/symlinks/sockets/block device/char device/fifo files.
Existing file API does not allow create anything but that.
Merging reiser4 with object plugins would make it necessary to modify
VFS layer so that files of arbitrary types could be created.
