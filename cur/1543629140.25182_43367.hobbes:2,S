Is this a numa? If not then you should be just perfectly fine with
discontigmem with this chip.

this means 256 nodes. for example that many different discontigmem nodes
would give you a measurable slowdown in the nr_free_pages O(N) loops
over the pgdat list, so nonlinear on the above hardware is a win. I
wasn't aware that such a memory layout actually existed. So if you
want to support the above efficiently we must make it possibe for you to
do nonlinear transparently to the common code kernel abstraction. What
are actually the common code changes involved with nonlinear? What I
care about is not to clobber the common code with additional overlapping
common code abstractions. We should try to make it possible to do
nonlinear under mips completly transparently to the current common code,
if we do that then you can use nonlinear to handle the above extreme
origin 200/2k scenario without the common code noticing that. Then
there's no point to argue about nonlinear or discontigmem, nonlinear
becomes mips way of handling virt_to_page and that's all, no
config_nonlinaer at all, just select ARCH=mips instead of ARCH=x86. Then
I'll be very fine with it of course, it would become an obviously right
implementation of virt_to_page/pte_page for a certain arch.
