Subject: [PATCH 4/5] sched-dont_decrease_idle_sleep_avg.patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/13/78

We watch for tasks that sleep extended periods and don't allow one single
prolonged sleep period from elevating priority to maximum bonus to prevent
cpu bound tasks from getting high priority with single long sleeps. There
is a bug in the current code that also penalises tasks that already have
high priority. Correct that bug.
