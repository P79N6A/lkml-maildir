Yes. And pretty much everyone agrees that these warnings serve no purpose.
Everyone knows that hot coffee is served hot.
What people probably don't know is that if you spill hot coffee on yourself
and remain in contact with the coffee for more than about 45 seconds, a
third-degree burn can result.  This warning doesn't convey that information.
I find it almost impossible to believe that anyone is going to alter their
behavior in any significant way as a result of that warning.
