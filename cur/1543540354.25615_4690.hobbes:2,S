A bit off topic but -- is it not quite a remarkable mess -- not only
are they guilty of some of the worst crimes ever perpetrated using
macros, their include file structure is so messed up that they not
only have:
markgray@soyo /usr/src/packages/BUILD/xc > find -name '*.h' -follow|\
           sed 's#.*/##' |sort|uniq -D|uniq -c|wc
     55     110     946
55! include files with the same names, they also accidently will
include files from whichever version of X you happen to have installed
at the time in a few places.  Quite a shock the first time you delve
into it.  What I did when I was writing my own X server was extract
all the files I needed from their tree and put them into my own
sensible directory structure, removed all their macros, fixed their
include file structure, prototyped everything and rewrote it so it
would compile without warnings using -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes --
(took me four months, by which time they had released three newer
versions :-)
