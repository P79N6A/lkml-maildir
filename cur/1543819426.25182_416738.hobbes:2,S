Hmm, that seems a lot more complicated that what I need.  And it seems
I end up needing to handle some sort of registration myself anyway,
because someone has to create the virtual devices when a real device
shows up (since multiple drivers can't bind to the same device).
I think I'll just code my own simple registration for sub-drivers of
the combo device -- it will just take a list_head, a mutex and a few
of lines of code.  That seems simpler to me than creating a fake bus
and fake devices for each combo device.
Thanks,
  Roland
