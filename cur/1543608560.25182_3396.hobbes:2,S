Why? It's not bad only because it is from MS. IMHO the disadvantages of the 
registry are:
- you need special software/syscalls to access it
- because of that making backups etc is hard
- the organization of the data is horrible
Assuming you could mount it as a regular filesystem and use it for kernel 
configuration, what else are its disadvantages?
