It doesn't matter if people hose their qmail forwards without fetchmail
anywhere, a provider fails to provide envelope information for that dung
of pile that a multidrop POP3 mailbox is, somehow you can always screw
up mailing lists. Use VERP to figure who is bouncing on you. And now
please take this off-list.

You have absolutely no clue of fetchmail. Get lost. Please. Come back
only after you got the *complete* fetchmail picture.
fetchmail does not bounce on its own for single-drop mailboxes, and as
long as 4.x.y or 5.3.x versions are still around on distributions, ESR
cannot do much about solutions you require either because users won't
get hold of the policy changes.

Fetchmail is by no means a MUA.

Having a common solution upstream is the way to save duplicate efforts.
And now let the fetchmail part of this thread please die.
