Related question while we are on the subject of bridges. I'm trying to
work out a clean way to initialize a new subtree of devices given a
bridge that suddenely has devices behind it.
This occurs in three cases I know about now 
- Easidock cardbus->PCI extender
- IBM Thinkpad hot docking bridge
- Magma PCI extended split bridge
