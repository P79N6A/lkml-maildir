Okay, false alarm... it's all my fault. :/
The cause of the problem was my previous tampering with udev rules.  The udev
rules as such (on Ubuntu Gutsy) were bad for hostapd, since persistent rules
were written for the wlan0ap interface name created by hostapd.  So I changed
a few things that had the unexpected effect of renaming the initial
hostap_pci's wifi0 into wlan0ap.  This in turn made hostap_pci oops in many
cases.
Anyway, I've modified my udev rules again and hopefully this will be it. =)
