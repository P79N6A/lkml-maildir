I don't think that this is the whole story.
Some applications talk to the kernel (eg via ioctl()). This is related to the 
kernel version that is running (not anything to do with the libs).
In reality, we need three sets of headers:
1. Things that are kernel independent, and depend on the glibc functionality
This is probably /usr/include
2. Things that are related to the kernel that the libs are compiled against
This is probably /usr/include/sys
3. Things that are related to the kernel that is running.
This is probably /usr/include/linux
The hard part is that the applications need to be matched to the kernel
binary API, which is essentially an impossible problem unless you have
a source tree that you recompile whenever you change the kernel 
API (and an API versioning system that tells you which version you 
need for each application).
