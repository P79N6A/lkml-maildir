Which would be nice I guess, if the rest of my system wasn't limited 
to 100mb/sec.  In my case here at home, thats plenty fast enough.
In any event thanks for the info.  My biggest squawk is that so far, 
I've had to assign it the same MAC address as the old D-Link card 
wore in order to make the firewall pass me.  arp problems I think.  
Other than that, its working great.
