Do take me seriously when I say that RTAI is seriously overlooked:
RT-Net (real-time UDP over Ethernet):
http://www.rts.uni-hannover.de/rtnet/
RT-USB (real-time USB):
https://mail.rtai.org/pipermail/rtai/2005-April/011192.html
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/rtusb
Both of these use RTAI on top of Adeos :P
