There's also the question about where the documentation should go.  By
the function prototype in the header?  That's the easy place for people
using the function to find it.  By the code?  That's the place where it
stands the most chance (about 10%) of somebody bothering to update it
when they change the code.

Indeed.  And reference count assumptions.  It's almost like we want a
pre-condition assertion ...
