The next limit are bitfields for processors in a number of places.  They're
stored in unsigned long variables, so this limits the kernel to 32
processors on 32-bit machines and 64 on 64-bit machines.  Kanoj once
fixed that and we had Linux booting on a 128p Origin but I'm not sure
if those fixes went back to Linus.  Once this is fixed there is a number
of arrays with NR_CPUS elements in struct task_struct.  Once you reach
an estimated number of 200-300 processors (for 16kb kernel stacks) those
make task_struct that large that the kernel stack may overflow.  I
haven't really researched all the gotchas that may cause problems with
the kernel when going to machines of more than 128 processors.
