The majority of the new code was added yesterday in -rt8. Here is the
interdiff between -rt7 and -rt7
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/dwalker/rt-interdiffs/patch-2.6.20-rc5-rt7-patch-2.6.20-rc5-rt8.patch
Since this new release has a fair amount of new code it's not totally
fair to says "it's been in -rt for a while".
My queue has always been 90% clean up, some of that is moving code
around. That's not all it does, and you can make an apples to apples
comparison between my tree and parts of this _new_ high res/dynamic tick
queue. 
If stability is a question, -rt10 does currently compile for my test
config, due to this new HRT introduction. I know from experience it's
going to take Thomas at least a few days just to make this new code
compile in all configs. This also means there are number of fairly
simple configs which this new HRT has not been tested in.
My patch set has been stable for months, and reviewed and tested by John
and I constantly (With you and Thomas on the CC list each release)..
It's a completely safe bet, IMO .
Daniel
