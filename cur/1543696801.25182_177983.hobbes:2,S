Well, there is only one capacity and we cannot tell at the time we
fetch the capacity from the drive whether the user will use the disk
read-only or read-write.
In any case, cdrom_read_capacity() is the only thing that works on my
MO drive, the other methods all fail. So my patch from yesterday changes 
the order of things so that read_capacity is used first to get the 
capacity, and the other methods are allowed to override it's findings
later on.
