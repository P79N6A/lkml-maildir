Ah. You just want to create totally new adress space, store parameters there
and then use that mm in exec_mmap and further... Hmm. Looks doable. I thought
that execve() does not create new address space at all and wanted to avoid this
(it's SLOW) but turned out that in most cases execve() doing it anyway...

Not such minor. You should move new mm creation from exec_mmap to execve and
rework some code not related to exec at all.

Then it's trikier then my version and does not have any benefits :-)

Ok. It's not exactly same thing but close.

Huh ??? Why there are need to be configuration part ??? It's rlimit and
setrlimit will handle it just fine.

No. You DO NOT want this. Even swap is limited resource. And with 8MiB of
stack you can construct rougly 4TB (tera!) of arguments. Enough to overflow
any sane swap :-)

There is: in case of OOM linux doing nasty things. Even with latest fixes in
this area.

Yeah :-)
P.S. In fact setproctitle(3) bother me more then unlimited set of arguments
but looks like I'm the only one on this list who ever use sendmail and ftpd :-(
