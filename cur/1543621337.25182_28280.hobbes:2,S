| How about something like the below (avoids writing a multi-MB temp file):
|
| HDR=`binoffset $1 0x1f 0x8b 0x08 0x0`
| dd if=$1 bs=1 skip=$HDR | zcat | strings /dev/stdin | grep CONFIG_
I tried that, but I didn't know about /dev/stdin,
so I agree with you.
I had tried 'strings -', but strings didn't like that.  :(

Yes, I said that I intended to remove the leading "CONFIG_".
I'll do that soon and package it all up and repost it.
Oh, and make it a CONFIG option.
Thanks for your help.
