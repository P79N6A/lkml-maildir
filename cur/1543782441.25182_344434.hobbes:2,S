yes, that's correct. Mainline's exit_io_contexts() uses the above 
construct because there's no task_lock_irqsave(current, flags) API.
note that recent -RT kernels are a lot less drastic about these cases 
and print a once-per-bootup warning, not a scary message like above.  
This message should not happen in recent -RT kernels.
The problem was this piece of code in exit_io_contexts():
        local_irq_save(flags);
        task_lock(current);
        ioc = current->io_context;
        current->io_context = NULL;
        ioc->task = NULL;
        task_unlock(current);
        local_irq_restore(flags);
i understand the detached use of flags, but i'm also wondering why irqs 
have to be disabled here in the first place? At this point in do_exit() 
we should normally not have any pending IO attached to our io_context.  
What am i missing?
