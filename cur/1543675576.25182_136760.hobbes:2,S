Seems reasonable.

I sugest you change the ->nopage definition so that page_table_lock is held
on entry to ->nopage, and ->nopage must drop it at some point.  This gives
the nopage implementations some more flexibility and may perhaps eliminate
that special case?

I don't think there's a lot of point in making changes until the code which
requires those changes is accepted into the tree.  Otherwise it may be
pointless churn, and there's nothing in-tree to exercise the new features.

That sounds better to me.
