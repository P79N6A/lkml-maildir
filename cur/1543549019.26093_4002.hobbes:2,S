Subject: 2.2.17 and on and glibc 2.1.3 initgroups() sometimes fails

   The last snapshot I tried before 2.2.17 was 13. When I installed 2.2.17
and 2.2.18pre9, initgroups fails sometimes.
   nssswitch.conf had the line:
group:		db files
   As a result, initgroups read the list from BOTH the db and from
/etc/group, doubling the number of groups. For some users that exceeded the
maximum, and the syscall failed with EINVAL.
   This may be the wrong syntax for nsswitch.conf. I haven't looked yet. It
is new behavior, though.
   I haven't recompiled glibc. Its too big a pain. I just took "files" out
of the lines for files that have DBs for them so both don't get read.
