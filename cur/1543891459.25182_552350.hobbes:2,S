Yes. Current affected_cpus they are dependent from user perspective.
Single set of /sysfs files linked in to multiple cpus. But kernel
Kernel knows that these are multiple dependent cpus and while
changing freq, driver typically goes from one CPU to other using
set_cpus_allowed to write MSR on all CPUs.

The problem here is that with hardware coordination, kernel need not
do what we do for affected_cpus today. Kernel can manage each CPU
independently in terms of setting freq as underlying hardware
guarantees to do the coordination (picking up the highest freq
among a group of dependent cpus). So ideally we can just manage cpu
frequencies as we do today without affected_cpus. But, in this case
there is a fyi from hardware which says even though OS is thinking that
CPUs are independent, hardware is doing the coordination across these
CPUs.
We cannot directly use affected_cpus for this. We can probably change
to use affected_cpus in a way that we enforce software coordination on
top of hardware coordination. But, maintaining freq as in current
affected_cpus may not be as optimal as doing a percpu policy and
decision.
