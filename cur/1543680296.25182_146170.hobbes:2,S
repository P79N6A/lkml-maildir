Subject: [RFC] move ksymoops to the "embedded" section
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/8/201

This patch moves the "Load all symbols for debugging/kksymoops"
config option out of the kernel hacking.
It doesn't belong there; average users aren't kernel hackers
and they need to report their bugs. There're already some
bug reports un 2.5 from systems were this doesn't harm. For most
of the people, it doesn't have a lot of sense to remove it if
they have enought ram.
So move it to the "General setup" -> "Remove kernel features for
embedded systems"; where it belongs, IMHO
It has been moved from all arch/*/Kconfig files to init/Kconfig
(where the embedded section resides)
I suppose this won't work for all arches; some of them doesn't
define KALLSYMS in their arch/*/Kconfig files; and they include init/Kconfig
so now they have KALLSYMS when they shouldn't need it
