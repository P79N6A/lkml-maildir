Hi Andrew,
I found the problem with O_DIRECT memory leak.
The problem is, when we are doing DIO read and crossed the end of file -
we don't release referencess on all the pages we got from get_user_pages().
(since it is a sucess case).
The fix is to call dio_cleanup() even for sucess cases. Can you please
review this ? I tested the patch with fsstress and there are no memory leak 
problems now.
Thanks,
Badari
