That is not enough, the 3ware driver only sets a 32-bit IO capability
mask. So you will still be bouncing to/from the upper 2G, Neils
diagnosis is absolutely right. If you want to verify this fact, boot
with profile=2 and run readprofile -r; updatedb; readprofile | sort -nr
and you should see the bounce copy functions near the top.
As a paying customer, you should ask 3ware about their hardware. They
might be able to support > 32-bit dma just noone has asked about this
feature yet. A quick peek at their driver shows they define their sg
address element as a 32-bit quantity, so maybe not...
