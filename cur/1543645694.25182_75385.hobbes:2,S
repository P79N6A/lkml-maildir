Ok, the 'type' attribute isn't enough.
I feel like we are trying to do two things at the same time:
a) the size of the allocated area isn't required if we need to do something
   real with the data: if size doesn't match what is expected, we loose 
   anyway
b) if we don't care about the copied data, we actually ask for the subtype
   of the interface
-> a) and b) are two different operations imho.
