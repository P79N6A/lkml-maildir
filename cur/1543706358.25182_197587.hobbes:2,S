Subject: Reiserfs crash while deleting specific file in 2.6.2

Kernel 2.6.2, not tainted.
My reiser root fs filled up while compiling, so I started deleting
extra files to make space. One directory in particular gives me a BUG
when I try to rm -rf it (I don't know if it's the same file each time;
the dir in question has no subdirs).
Running 'dmesg' afterwards to check messages hangs. So do other
commands I tried. I can still type at existing shells until I hit
enter, so I had to reboot.
When I repeated this at the console, I saw the following (which I had
to scribble on paper, so I just grabbed what I guessed was most
useful):
-----------
Kernel BUG at fs/reiserfs/prints.c:339
invalid operand: 0000 [#1]
call trace:
	reiserfs_do_truncate+0x34a/0x5f0
	reiserfs_delete_object
	reiserfs_delete_inode
	reiserfs_delete_inode
	generic_delete_inode
-------------
This is repeatable (2 for 2, anyway), and I will get more info if requested.
