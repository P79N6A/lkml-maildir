Hmm.. Why is it right on those, but not on normal machines? The APIC is 
the same, and if the big machines need it, apparently at least _one_ small 
machine needs it too..
Also, if we find that the ESR value was non-zero, it sounds a bit stupid 
to enable error delivery at bootup. We already know there was an error, we 
don't need to be told.
