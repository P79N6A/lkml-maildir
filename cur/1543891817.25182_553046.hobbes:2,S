I you running a 64 or 32bit kernel?  If it is 32bit then it is normal
for a kernel not configured with CONFIG_4GB or whatever it is called to
be limited to about 900MB ram.  64bit kernels should see all the ram no
matter what the config is.  It looks very much like you are running a
32bit kernel though.  What does uname -a say?
