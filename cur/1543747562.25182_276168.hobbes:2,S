ca. 1.3ms

yep. now the question is: why did jackd have to wait so long for the
client? what was the client doing? was it sleeping? what client was it?
probably not the simple jack_test client, right?
Short tests ((20 minutes, due to lack of time) with cvs jackd and a
number of modified jack_test clients (added a for loop in the process()
callback to burn cycles to increase the cpu load) show no xruns here
even with relatively high cpu load (around 70%) and a periodsize of 64
frames. Of course i had the mandatory additional kernel compile running
in the background :)

Oh wow. Just before hitting send i got three xruns of around
0.020-0.050msec. Ok, will read up on recent emails to see what to do to
debug these.
