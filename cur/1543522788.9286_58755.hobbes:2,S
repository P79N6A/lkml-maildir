I have reciently moved from OS/2 to linux.  One the the things I miss most are applications
that do not block stupidly.  As linux threading improves, more and more, programs are going
to use threads and will become more and more responsive.  If java, if it catches on in linux, 
will also tend to use lots of threads.  Having a solution that costs a couple of percent on
lightly loaded boxes but saves when the system is pushed would seem to be a win in my books.
