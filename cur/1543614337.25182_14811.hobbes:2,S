I've coded a test app that uses the LatSched latency patch ( that uses
rdtsc ).
It basically does 1) set the current process priority to RT 2) an ioctl()
to activate the scheduler latency sampler 3) sleep for 1-2 secs 4) ioctl()
to stop the sampler 5) peek the sample with pid == getpid().
In this way i get the net RT task scheduler latency. Yes it does not get
the real one that includes accessories kernel paths but my code does not
affect these ones. And they add noise to the measure.
