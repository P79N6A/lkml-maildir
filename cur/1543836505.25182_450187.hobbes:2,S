Subject: [PATCH 1/10] hot-add-mem x86_64: acpi motherboard fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Is the first of 10 patches.  They were built ontop of Kames 6 patches sent out
within the last few days ([RFC][PATCH] fix ioresouce handling take2 [1/5] was 
the first).  Kames patches fix several real isses and with the 6th patch they
are complete from my point of view. 
I have worked to integrate the feedback I recived on the last round of patches
and welcome more ideas/advice. Thanks to everyone who has provied input on
these patches already. 
This patch set allow SPARSEMEM and RESERVE based hot-add to work.  I have
test both options and they work as expected.  I am adding memory to the 
2nd node of a numa system (x86_64).    
Major changes from last set is the config change and RESERVE enablment.

Make ACPI motherboard driver not attach to devices/handles it dosen't expect. 
Fix a bug where the motherboard driver attached to hot-add memory event and 
caused the add memory call to fail.
