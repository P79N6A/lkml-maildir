A "random" word will not occur frequently enough in spam messages (when
measured over a large sample of spam) to become a "spam" token or to
adversely effect it becoming a "ham" token.  (If it did, then it would be a
good indicator of "spam", and spammers wouldn't be using it in their
"random" word blocks.)  Also, the algorithms in the filter make sure that
words don't become spam tokens just because one receives more spam than ham
(ie. you can't train the filter to over aggressively catch spam).
Don't get me wrong - I agree that multi-word bayes filters can be more
precise.  But, I don't see them as being significantly different from
single word filters -- they're susceptible to the same "attack" you outline
above (with blocks of random sentences) -- and they will have larger
dictionaries and require more training time.

A lot of testing has been done on these filters (see for example
http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/background.html
) with a very large email
corpus.  If you haven't looked at bayes filters recently, or have only been
looking at the simplistic ones, then I think you might have better luck
trying again.
