Well the Documentation is said to matches 2.6.8-rc3 and is only 5 weeks 
old according to bitkeeper changesets... So at least the doc should be 
fixed.

Why removing memory-mapped IO in one case (status) and not the other 
(statm)? Memory mapped IO, may of course reserve some physical memory 
pages for establishing the mmu->phys adress translation table (if any) 
but not really the amount of space mapped.

OK. Too bad because statm is hardly readable but I guess it is not for 
human then...
Thanks for responding,
