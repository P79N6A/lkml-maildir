Maybe, I should give some hints...
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK did first apear in BSD-4.4 around 1994.
The iplementation is incomplete since then and partially disabled (size check 
for mmap() in the kernel) on FreeBSD as it has been 1994 on BSD-4.4
FreeBSD currently uses a default value of RLIMIT_INFINITY for users.
I could add this piece of code to the euid == 0 part of cdrecord:
LOCAL void 
raise_memlock() 
{ 
#ifdef  RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 
        struct rlimit rlim; 
 
        rlim.rlim_cur = rlim.rlim_max = RLIM_INFINITY; 
 
        if (setrlimit(RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, &rlim) < 0) 
                errmsg("Warning: Cannot raise RLIMIT_MEMLOCK limits."); 
#endif  /* RLIMIT_NOFILE */ 
}
