As any professional typist will tell you, typing speeds are measured
in "Words per Minute" where a word is defined as six keystrokes,
counting SHIFT and CTRL as separate keystrokes (so capitals count as
two keystrokes, lower case as one).
I was recently tested and found to have a speed of 46 WPM = 276
keystrokes per minute. Simple arithmetic states that 276 per minute is
already over 4.5 keystrokes per second, and I'm by no means a fast
touch typist.
To put this in context, there are companies that state in their job
applications that they will only consider applications from people
with a typing speed over 75 WPM. Doing the arithmetic on that, we see
that 75 WPM = 450 keystrokes per minute = 7.5 keystrokes per second.
I hope this helps.
Best wishes from Riley.
