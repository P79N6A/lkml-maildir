But you know how is clear_page_tables done right now: it is reading it entry
by entry, comparing for NULL and if not NULL, freeing it/clearing.
So it is definitely much much slower.
I'll code what I postponed for 2.3 (completely fine grained page table
freeing), as I think 2.3 is close (at least I hope).
Cheers,
