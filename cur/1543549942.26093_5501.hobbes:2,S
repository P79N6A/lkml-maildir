if a stupid root user keeps inserting bogus modules :-) then thats a
problem, no matter what. I can DoS your system if given the right to
insert arbitrary size modules, even if kmalloc returns NULL. For such
things explicit highlevel protection is needed - completely independently
of the VM allocation issues. Returning NULL in kmalloc() is just a way to
say: 'oops, we screwed up somewhere'. And i'd suggest to not work around
such screwups by checking for NULL and trying to handle it. I suggest to
rather fix those screwups.
the __GFP_SOFT suggestion handles these things nicely.
