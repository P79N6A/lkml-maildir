I've been meaning to have a read through this for some time, and I'm finally 
getting around to it.  Random question: you seem to have embedded much of Joe 
Orton's Neon project (
http://freshmeat.net/projects/neon/
) in your tgz.  Is 
there any particular reason for that?  Isn't this going to turn into a 
maintainance problem eventually?
