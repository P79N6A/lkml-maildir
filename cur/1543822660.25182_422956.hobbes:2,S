m4linux - linux on the mach kernel (doesn't look as good as l4linux)
l4linux - linux on the l4 microkernel (with 8 architectures supported so far)
          currently doing 2.6.16
wombat - an alternate l4 microkernel port (only one architecture?) 
         currently doing 2.6.9
so - it's already been done.
now, could someone _please_ take linus' laptop away from him and install
l4linux on it overnight, and see if he notices?
thank you :)
