Well I'd say it controls the allocation failures. And that only works if 
one can consider the system having a single zone.
Lets say the system has two cpusets A and B. A allocs from node 1 and B 
allocs from node 2. Two processes one in A and one in B run on the same 
processor.
Node 1 gets very low in memory so your patch kicks in and sets up the 
global memory emergency situation with the reserve slab.
Now the process in B will either fail although it has plenty of memory on 
node 2.
Or it may just clear the emergency slab and then the next critical alloc 
of the process in A that is low on memory will fail.
