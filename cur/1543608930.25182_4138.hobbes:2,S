hi
What's coolest/best/worst of ext3, ReiserFS and XFS?
I just set up a RedHat 7.2 box with ext3, and after a few tests/chrashes,
I see no difference at all. After a chrash, it really wants to run fsck
anyway. I've tried ReiserFS before, with no fsck after chrashes - is this
because ReiserFS is better, or is it more like a hope-it's-ok-thinkig?
Then - last - How about XFS?
