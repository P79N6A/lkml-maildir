You surprise me, Christoph, I'd expected you to approve of CaT's.
If tmpfs already defaulted to 50% of ram+swap, then I'd agree
with you.  But it has all along been in terms of RAM, so I think
it's better to continue in that way.  (We could add options to
allow +swap in too, but I'm not terribly interested.)
If people really wanted their tmpfs pages to go out to disk, I think
they'd be choosing a more sophisticated filesystem to manage that:
swap is a vital overflow area for tmpfs, not its home.
