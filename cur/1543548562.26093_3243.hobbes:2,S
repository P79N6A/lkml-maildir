Unless it's _absolutely_ necessary, the kernel image (i.e. vmlinux) should
not contain any code which is dependent on CONFIG_*_MODULE options. 
Therefore, stuff like...
#ifdef CONFIG_WIN32_MODULE
	EXPORT_SYMBOL(my_win32_helper_func);
#endif
...would mean that you have to recompile the kernel and reboot to enable the
module, rather than just compiling and loading the module.
For something which is likely to be distributed separately from the kernel, 
this would be particularly painful.
