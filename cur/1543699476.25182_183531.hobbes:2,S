I refer you to this post just two days ago:
	Date:   Tue, 9 Dec 2003 16:06:02 +0000
	From:   Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
	To:     Linux Kernel <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
	Subject: post halloween document moved..
 
	The box hosting www.codemonkey.org.uk died dramatically
	recently, resulting in the post halloween 2.6 document being offline.
	I've had a few requests for me to put this someplace else
	whilst I get things fixed up, so for the time being, you
	can find the last version I was able to find in backups at
