doh.
OK, there was a nasty bug in 0.9.1 which I was not able to trigger
in a solid month's testing.  But others with more worthy hardware
were able to find it quite quickly.  Stephen fixed it in 0.9.2.
I don't know if it explains the failure you saw.  This:
	EXT3-fs error (device md(9,0)): ext3_new_inode: reserved
	inode or inode > inodes count - block_group = 0,inode=1
is nasty.  The LRU cache of inode bitmaps got wrecked.  Ugly.
Maybe one more try?

Yup.  I've nailed this one - it's lovely.
I'll be back.
