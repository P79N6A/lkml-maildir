Precedence: bulk

I'd decided to run 2.5.31, and actually gotten it mostly-working when I
noticed that quite a few of my favorite modules had unresolved symbols,
mostly related to cli()/sti() and friends, so I did a semiautomatic
(completely attended) conversion of the following:
sound/oss/
drivers/net/irda/
net/irda/
The patch is rather large (111K in over 4000 lines).
Would the proper procedure be to:
split the patch up into 2 or 3 pieces and send to proper maintainers (if
I can find them),
split the patch up and send to linus+LKML,
or upload the whole thing as one big patch to HTTP and post the link
here ?
