What do you mean by "policy"?
If you are saying that SDE allows programmers the ability to write new
programs to plug into your framework to create new types of policies,
then I understand that.  Your loadable plugins look like they support
that.  But they require a dynamic loader :)
What udev is doing is trying to provide a flexible policy that will work
for everyone, with a heirchy of rules that can be easily controlled and
changed by anyone who can operate a text editor (and soon to be changed
by GUI applications, like the HAL project).
I have not heard of any situation in which the current udev set of rules
do not work out for them.  And if you can think of one, can't it be
covered by the CALLOUT rule?  For example, someone has sent me a small
userspace program that works with the CALLOUT rule that handles
multipath devices by talking to the dm code.  Now that's pretty
flexible.
If you (or anyone else) thinks of something that the existing udev rules
do not handle, please let me know.  If it's too complex, then yes, the
user should use write their own SDE plugin.  But remember, 99.9% of the
people out there just want the LSB device names, with possibly a
persistent entry for their digital camera and USB joystick, which udev
handles just fine today.
For people with 4000 real scsi disks, udev also works well.  That seems
to cover the wide range of users.

Easy Separation?  Hm, in looking at udev, if you just replace 2 .c files
with your new naming scheme, everything works just fine.
And if you want to go down the path of accusations about lack of
maintainability, bloat, etc. I will be glad to point people at your tree
and then they can see these kinds of numbers:
For SDE:
$ find . -type f | egrep '[.c|.h]$' | xargs wc -l | tail -1
  57328 total
Wow, you build 18 shared libraries:
$ find . -type f | grep '\.so' | wc
     18      18     625
For udev:
$ find . -type f | egrep '[.c|.h]$' | xargs wc -l | tail -1
  17632 total
And that includes all of klibc, which really is not fair for udev to
calculate.  So let's just look at the udev code size:
$ ls | egrep '[.c|.h]$' | xargs wc -l | tail -1
   2613 total
And to be complete, let's add the totals of libsysfs and tdb, but to be
fair any udev developer never has to look into those files:
libsysfs is this big:
   3798 total
And tdb is this big:
   2679 total
So adding those numbers up we get these kinds of numbers for size of the
.c and .h files in the different projects:
	SDE:	57328 lines
	udev:	 9090 lines
That makes SDE over 6 times bigger in source code alone than all of
udev (including tdb and libsysfs).
I can compare executable size too, if you really want to still claim
that udev is suffering from "lack of maintainability and bloat" if you
really want :)
Oh, any reason you all haven't shown a working uSDE system in public
anywhere?
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. yes, I know lines of code is a horrible metric, and doesn't really
mean squat.  I just want to point out the huge size difference between
the current state of udev and SDE, with pretty much identical
functionality from what I can tell.
