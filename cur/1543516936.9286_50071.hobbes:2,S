Hi, I am new here. I am running RH6.0, 2.2.5-15. I rebuilt the kernel. Works
fine.
I changed the save_flag macro a little and insert one extra function
testfoo() at the end of the macro. compile and the kernel works fine.
However, all the modules fail to load because the missing symbol, testfoo().
I did put/export_symbol the testfoo() inside ksyms.c as others. The
system.map file has the testfoo symbol too. Just that
the modules are failing.
Did I miss something in the source code or in the makefile?
Thanks.
