It takes noticably longer to ssh into the machine also in the
single-threaded case (using dd to write to the device), but the
system remains usable. When the rsync job is running, it becomes
unusable quickly.
However, reducing the queue depth with
	echo 16 > /sys/block/sda/device/queue_depth
as suggested by Adam, solves all problems.
Thanks all for your help.
