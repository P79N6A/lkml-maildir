An additional FYI.  JFS also treats the dev_t in its superblock the same
way.  Since jfs relies on jfs_fsck running at boot time to ensure that
the journal is replayed, jfs_fsck makes sure that the dev_t is accurate.
If not, then it scans all of the block devices until it finds the uuid
of the journal device, updating the superblock so that the kernel will
find the journal.
