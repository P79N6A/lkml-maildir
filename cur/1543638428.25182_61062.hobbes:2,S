Personally, I think that uninterruptible file io is good, but there needs 
to be an upper limit to the maximum size of the io.  As it stands today, 
someone can do a single multigigabyte read or write that is completely 
uninterruptible (even to kill -9), but could take a minute or more to 
complete.
