If we work on the "commonly found" basis then it would be
pata_atiixp
pata_hpt37x
pata_hpt3x2n
pata_pdc2027x
All four commonly are found with SATA bridges, ATIIXP especially.
On the "almost any obscure case basis" would add
pata_ali
pata_sis
pata_via
and depending how far pushed
pata_sil680
and one or two others
Which do you want renamed ?
