There are quite a few indirect benefits:
The kernel itself might be faster because it takes advantage
of extra registers and so on.  So the app might wait less on
its syscalls.
Also, this app may be 32-bit but surely a lot of other programs
will be available as 64-bit software and will be faster.  That
leaves more time for running your 32-bit app.
