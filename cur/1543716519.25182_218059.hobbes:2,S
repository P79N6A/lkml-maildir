Thanks.  I've also got some one reporting to me of having the same problem
with the Asus A7N8X board.  Also note, that I don't have the intel8x0 loaded
and it will still do it.  I can even disable the onboard sound in BIOS and it
will _still_ have the sound on the speaker out.  Want to know how the sound 
varies?  Try compiling a linux kernel.  Between executing make processes the sound will vary alot (from nothing to the annoying pitch).  The sound is quite 
faint to probably be heard on speakers, but on headphones you probably will 
hear it.  To me, this is indicative of the C1 disconnects.
