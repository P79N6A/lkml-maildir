> your memory timings are out of spec.
I don't know what spec applies here, don't really care.
But when I backed off my Memory Timing from 1T to 2T,
my box became stable running this memset() test.
So I am a happy camper, grateful that someone posted
this nice test, and agree with you that it was a memory
timing issue, at least for my system.
Apparently Philip's box has additional "issues".  Whatever.
