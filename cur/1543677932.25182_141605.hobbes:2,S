OK, so the important point here is that while you probably delay events 
for a small amount of time (1-3 seconds maybe) to ensure that you aren't 
processing steps out of order, it's not likely that userspace is going 
hold event #1321 for an indefinite period of time just because it has 
never seen event #1320.
I can't wait to see this implementation; it's going to be interesting, 
to say the least. However, without the sequence numbers, it would very 
likely be impossible.
