I'm working on something similar, but with alternate pathname resolution
when the path begins with exactly two slashes. Only pseudocode here because
I do not have access to my box:
In path_lookup()
    if (*name == '/') {
       if (*(name+1)=='/' && *(name+2)==':') {
          name+=3;
          nd->flags &= LOOKUP_SLASHSLASH
          if (*name!='/')
            goto relative;
       }
    
In link_path_walk()
    When LOOKUP_SLASHSLASH, handle names as follows:
    If this !S_ISDIR()
       next.name  Behavior 
       ------------------------------------------------------
       .          Same if i_op && i_op->lookup, else -ENOTDIR.
       ..         Same.
       ...        Okay if i_op && i_op->lookup, else -ENOTDIR.
       otherwise  Fails with -ENOENT.
       
    If S_ISDIR()
       any        Same behavior
I tested the //: & flag code and this works (in my limited testing yesterday
with bash and some test programs). 
This should limit "hybrid" file-directories to only one valid subdirectory,
the "special metadata" directory. Thus, if a new/modified app wants to
create/access metadata, it would do something like the following:
   # relative path
   cd /test
   touch foo.txt	
   mkdir foo.txt/...     # FAILS
   mkdir //:foo.txt/...
   echo JayRandom > //:foo.txt/.../Author
   # absolute path
   echo blahblah > //:/test/foo.txt/.../Title
   mkdir testdir
   mkdir //:testdir/...
   echo no > //:testdir/.../VirusScan
Yes, this means that a) ... is "removed" from the namespace and b) directory
metadata directories are visible to naïve applications/users while those for
files are not. But it does provide "metadata-aware" apps/users a consistent
way to access this info for both files and directories without resorting to
openat(). Since SuS provides for "implementation-specific" pathname
resolution when pathnames begin with exactly two slashes this should be
legal(?), if desired.
This doesn't address the issue of "active" metadata objects such as reiser4
provides e.g. foo.txt/metas/perms. That's a different discussion.
