So any database without multi-user support doesn't count as a database?  
Whereas a simple index like modern libdb2 does?
Somehow I don't think so.

My definition says that some better databases *have* transaction  
management (which, incidentally, is *not* primarily about multi-user  
capabilities, but about commit and rollback).

The filesystem *is* a database - a *specialized* database. A typical Unix  
fs, for example, allows for exactly one type of key (a pathname) and has  
only BLOBs for non-key data fields (the file data). OTOH, an AS/400 file  
system is just a view onto a relational database. (Even the active  
processes are in that database.)
