Rejected. Linus, please don't apply this bogus patch. External patches
and drivers rely on the inline stubs so that #ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS
isn't needed.
Martin, why are you bothering with this kind of false cleanup? These
inline stubs don't take up any space in the object files, so why
bother? Also, given that the stubs were carefully added in the first
place, it suggests that there is a good reason for their presence.
Why didn't you stop and think it through before firing off a patch, or
at least ask me if you couldn't see why? This "patch first, think/ask
questions later" approach is disturbing.
