Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Don't change transfer speed while requests are in flight
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/20/412

Use ide_wait_cmd() in ide_config_drive_speed() if the drive has been
initialized and we're not in an interrupt, to avoid changing the
xfer speed while requests are in flight.
An easy way to trigger the problem is to dd the disk while doing
while :; do hdparm -d 1 /dev/hdc> /dev/null; done
While there, remove some commented-out code.
