What is complicated here ? The formula, at least as we do on ppc64, is
simply:
 time = (hw_value - prescale offset) / scale + post scale offset
Please, don't tell me that a substraction bothers you for performances,
and this first offset, while it could maybe be "folded" into the second
one, is actually handy, especially since it allows you to keep the
(hw_value - prescale offset) in a 32 bits number if your HW timebase
isn't too fast.
Now, for the details, on ppc, we calculate time in what we call "xsecs"
which is 2^20 xsec/sec, so not exactly micro or nanoseconds, but that's
also for simplifying calculations, we may want the generic code to just
fallback on to ns.

The main problem with performances in the new code is the fact that it
does the ntp correction on every call. John is aware that it is a
problem and will fix that.

Which is what John is trying to do, so help instead of criticizing :)
