Not sure what you mean by (a) there, so assuming you meant 1.
If pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast} is called with the condvar's associated
mutex held, then the standard is pretty clear when a thread is considered
blocked in pthread_cond_*wait on the condvar, as releasing the mutex and
getting blocked on the condvar in pthread_cond_*wait shall be observed as
atomic by other threads.  If pthread_cond_{signal,broadcast} is called
without the mutex held, it is not that clear.
Anyway, pthread_cond_signal is supposed to wake at least one thread
blocked in pthread_cond_*wait (if there are any).
The scenario described in futex_wait-fix.patch IMHO can happen even
if all calls to pthread_cond_signal are done with mutex held around it, i.e.
A		B		X		Y
pthread_mutex_lock (&mtx);
pthread_cond_wait (&cv, &mtx);
  - mtx release *)
  total++ [1/0/0] (0) {}
				pthread_mutex_lock (&mtx);
				pthread_cond_signal (&cv);
				  - wake++ [1/1/0] (1) {}
				  FUTEX_WAKE, 1 (returns, nothing is queued)
				pthread_mutex_unlock (&mtx);
		pthread_mutex_lock (&mtx);
		pthread_cond_wait (&cv, &mtx);
		  - mtx release *)
		  total++ [2/1/0] (1) {}
  FUTEX_WAIT, 0
  queue_me [2/1/0] (1) {A}
  0 != 1
		FUTEX_WAIT, 1
		queue_me [2/1/0] (1) {A,B}
		1 == 1
						pthread_mutex_lock (&mtx);
						pthread_cond_signal (&cv);
						  - wake++ [2/2/0] (2) {A,B}
						  FUTEX_WAKE, 1 (unqueues incorrectly A)
						  [2/2/0] (2) {B}
						pthread_mutex_unlock (&mtx);
  try to dequeue but already dequeued
  would normally return EWOULDBLOCK here
  but as unqueue_me failed, returns 0
  woken++ [2/2/1] (2) {B}
		schedule_timeout (forever)
  - mtx reacquire
  pthread_cond_wait returns
pthread_mutex_unlock (&mtx);
		-------------------
		the code would like to say pthread_mutex_unlock (&mtx);
		and pthread_exit here, but never reaches there.
Now, if at this point say A pthread_join's B, Y pthread_join's A and
X pthread_join's Y, the program should eventually finish, as B must have
been woken up according to the standard.  Whether signal in X means
pthread_cond_wait in A returning first or pthread_cond_wait in B returning
first is I believe not defined unless special scheduling policy is used,
as both A and B are supposed to contend for mtx lock.
But I believe both A and B must be awaken, assuming no other thread attempts
to acquire mtx afterwards.
*) therefore other threads that acquire mtx can now consider A blocked on
   the condvar
