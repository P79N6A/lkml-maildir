Yes, I guess this is currently a future issue. If this is going to
be done, there also needs fix in userland program, like fdisk and
hdparm.

But we're definitely going to face the problem as we'll probably
see IDE disk larger then 128GB next year. What was the current
max - 80GB, I thought? That not so far away from 128GB.

Actually it was the one I found out its usage first :-). Its
interface seems OK for me.
For TASK vs. CMD issue, I have no definite idea on it. But if sole
reason for CMD interface is to limit invalid/unsafe IDE command
submission, I guess they could (not should) go to userland as a
library (libsafeide?). I'll re-read the discussion so I can write
something more thought out.
