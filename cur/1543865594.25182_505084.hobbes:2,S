It turns out that overwriting the separating slash is the intended behavior for
pseudo filesystems such as pipefs, which end up producing pathnames
like "pipe:[deadbeef]" with "pipe:"  as the root dentry's name
and "[deadbeef]" as the child's name. Special casing this doesn't make a
lot of sense to me, but I guess it will probably have to stay -- quite a few
programs presumable rely on this convention.
Here is an updated patch that also catches this special case.
While looking into this, I noticed that the inotifyfs and futexfs pseudo
filesystems don't use a trailing slash in the root dentry name (see
get_sb_pseudo() in fs/inotify_user.c and kernel/futex.c). Should this be
changed?

Updated patch follows.
