Actually, I was pointing out a logical fallacy. I'll spell it out long here so 
everyone can see the point I was trying to make.
Person A writes a device driver and releases it under a dual license.
Person B modifies said device driver and licenses his changes under only one 
of the licenses on the device driver. Nobody complains.
Person C modifies the same device driver and licenses his changes under the 
other license on the device driver. People start complaining.
In this case either the actions of both persons B and C are legal - in which 
case neither person B or person C is likely to lose a lawsuit (or even face 
one) - or they are illegal, in which case the second a lawsuit is brought 
against person C, the same lawsuit must be brought against person B.
The exact nature of the licenses and whether one is a superset or subset of 
the other doesn't matter. Either the action of making modifications licensed 
solely under one or the other of the two licenses on the original code-base 
is illegal or it isn't.

Fully agreed. I've even said such myself.

I've suggested that such be done in the future - if just because it *IS* how 
it should be done.

Would cost me money to consult a lawyer over this, but I do have a few friends 
that have completed law school and are waiting on the results of the BAR. 
They have told me that they are not legally allowed to dispense legal 
advice - but I got around that by asking them to recount what the law 
actually says.
Apparently the above suggestion would meet the letter of the law.
