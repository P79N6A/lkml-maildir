I would think that you can't do HT without ACPI, so there's no point in 
building in HT scheduling unless you can have HT.
Is that what you were asking? I was hoping someone else would comment.
Scheduling is getting harder and harder to get right... I have this 
thought of a Beowolf cluster of NUMA machines, with each node being HT 
multicore SMP. By "right" I meant "optimal," I'm sure that setup would 
do something reasonable with current scheduling.
