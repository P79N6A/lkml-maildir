  You want kernel-source.2.4.18-10.i386.rpm.  The kernel-source package 
is not compiled so it works just as well on 386 or a Quad P4 Xeon.  The 
only difference is the config file used to compile the kernel. The 
config file can be found in the configs directory in the kernel source.
BTW- kernel-2.4.18-17.7.x is redhat's current eratta kernel.  In 
addition your downloads may be a bit faster if you use a mirror.
