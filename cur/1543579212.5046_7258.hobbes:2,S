such dynamic properties should IMO never become visible to user-space
interfaces i believe. TCP_CORK/MSG_MORE (which are both the same thing, in
a different interface) are a way to specify logical neighborhood of
app-side SENDs. I believe the most sensible and generic thing to do is to
require MSG_MORE information from the application: 'is it likely that the
application is going to SEND something soon, or not?'.
Submitting an exact timetable of planned future SENDs (with a fully
specified probability distribution of every expected future SEND event)
would be the most informative thing to do, but this is not very practical.
Basically MSG_MORE is a simplified probability distribution of the next
SEND, and it already covers all the other (iovec, nagle, TCP_CORK)
mechanizm available, in a surprisingly easy way IMO. I believe MSG_MORE is
very robust from a theoreticaly point of view.
To use this information to judge saturation situations properly is
completely up to the stack.
