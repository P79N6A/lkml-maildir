You could also solve all your computer problems by not using a computer.

This is not the problem. It's not the kernel's fault, it's less's fault. 
When you pipe to less, it only reads enough to display on the screen.  X is
sending tons more information than less is willing to read therefor X will
block (stop) until less reads more.  I've done this myself.  my work around
is to press END as soon as I hit enter.  That way less will go to the end
and not block.
You're better off doing:
X > somefile 2>&1
then lessing "somefile".  this won't block the X server.
I agree with matt that this is off-topic as it's not a kernel issue, it's
userland.
