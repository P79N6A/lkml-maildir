So there basically is an "exportfs" (sysfs) and an "importfs" (configfs). 
[This has nothing to do with the nfs-exportfs for the moment.]
Can't these be merged to have a "importexportfs", would make things 
simpler. Especially with system parameters (exported stuff, /sys) can be 
changed (aka imported).
