I was playing around with the cpuid instruction today and noticed newer
versions of Linux disable the pIII serial number without any sort of "Yes
I want to disable this" anywhere..  I had to go hack
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/setup.c :(  I was wondering why the pIII
serial is so dangerous we aren't even allowing the OPTION to leave it
enabled..
