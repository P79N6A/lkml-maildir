That's exactly why making ATAPI devices look like SCSI is desirable, so I
can use the cd, block, and tape drivers used for actual SCSI devices with
ATAPI devices, just as everyone already does with USB and parallel
devices.

I don't understand that sentence, if I assume you meant "driver" it still
doesn't seem to convey your meaning. Clearly the sd driver works with real
SCSI, USB flash devices, parallel attach ZIP and similar (ppa driver)
devices, and in 2.4 ATAPI ZIP drives and other similar devices. So I
assume I'm missing your meaning.
