Yes, Pat and I have talked a lot about the need for a driver "state".  I
think the current goal was to see how far we can get without needing it.
I was certainly cursing the lack of it today when trying to debug this
problem, but in the end, having it would have only masked over the
real problem that was there.
So personally, I keep going back and forth on if it is really necessary
or not to have.  Right now, the USB drivers and developers are very used
to the fact that when the device disappears from the system, they can
not access it anymore, and that this needs to be constantly checked.  I
think that as time goes on, and more subsystems become "hot-pluggable"
either this paranoia will have to spread to the other subsystems, or we
will have to create the notion of a device "state" to make things
easier on everyone.

As far as I know, it doesn't, but I'm not sure.

Well, that's a driver unload issue, which I think everyone agrees on the
fact that it's not ok to do automatic driver unload when a device is
removed, because of this very problem.
