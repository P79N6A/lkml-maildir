There's an interesting thing. Fedora Kernel 2.6.7 works for me, Fedora
Kernel 2.6.8 breaks wine/xst. Interestingly, Linus 2.6.8 works. Now the
biggest changes between the Fedora Kernels 2.6.7-1.494.2.2 and
2.6.8-1.521, besides the rebasing, are some execshield changes and
flexible mmap. execshield cannot be the culprit as it's not in 2.6.10-
ac1, but flexible mmap seems to be in 2.6.10-ac1. To me, a candidate for
further scrutiny is flexmmap, although I do not claim to have a clue
about linux-mm...
