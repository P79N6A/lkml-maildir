Done. But this time I didn't attach 10k... Did I post to too many lists?
No complaints so far, and I still think this subject is relevant for all
of them, but you never know...
The new version of the patch is at
http://www.csn.tu-chemnitz.de/~mha/patch.ftp-data-2.gz
Example of my rules used for testing this time (ipchains-save),
connections from test-host to one test ftp server:
:input ACCEPT
:forward ACCEPT
:output ACCEPT
:ftp-data -
-A input -s 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 21:21 -d 10.10.0.5/255.255.255.255 -i
eth1 -p 6 -j ACCEPT ! -y
-A input -s 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 20:20 -d 10.10.0.5/255.255.255.255 -i
eth1 -p 6 -j ftp-data
-A input -s 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 -d 10.10.0.5/255.255.255.255 -i eth1
-p 6 -j REJECT
-A output -s 10.10.0.5/255.255.255.255 -d 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 21:21
-i eth1 -p 6 -j ACCEPT
-A output -s 10.10.0.5/255.255.255.255 -d 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 20:20
-i eth1 -p 6 -j ftp-data
-A output -s 10.10.0.5/255.255.255.255 -d 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 -i eth1
-p 6 -j REJECT
