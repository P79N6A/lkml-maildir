Subject: Cannot build the PCMCIA Serial Device Driver in 2.3.28.

If I enable PCMCIA support in the kernel,
the "xconfig" page for "PCMCIA character device support"
shows "m" and "n" in black, but clicking on either of
them does not result in the option being selected.
I attempted to work around the problem by setting
CONFIG_PCMCIA_CHRDEV=y in .config, but my build failed
with this error:
  ld: cannot open drivers/char/pcmcia/pcmcia_char.o: 
  No such file ordirectory
