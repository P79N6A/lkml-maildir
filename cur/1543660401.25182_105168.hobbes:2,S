Humm, that's a good idea.  I already made the mods
to files to add an #include <asm/if.h>.  That would
be a logical place to stick such macros.  I will
check this out and re-submit the patches if it's
workable.
Maybe this was what Andi meant too.  Originally thought
he meant a script file wrapper for gcc.
Will write back soon,
