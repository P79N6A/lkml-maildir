I'm not sure if my key-mappings are the best, but for my use they are
excellent.  I added a 'Ctrl', 'Alt', 'Tab', 'Esc' and some more keys.
The 'fullscreen'-button acts as a 'f', as it makes Totem, TVtime, gXine
etc go fullscreen ...
I don't know how, but if I still could help in any way, make it clear
how :)
friendly greets,
