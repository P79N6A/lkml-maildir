I tried the latter. Doesn't seem to work.
I attached the patches.
Those are a patch for the 2.6.6 kernel and the 2.6.4 kernel.
When I was going through all my kernel branches in /usr/src I noticed
that the Gentoo development branch already had a suitable entry for the
firmware version of my device:
/* Reported by Henning Schild <henning@wh9.tu-dresden.de> */
UNUSUAL_DEV(  0x05e3, 0x0702, 0x0113, 0x0113,
                "EagleTec",
                "External Hard Disk",
                US_SC_DEVICE, US_PR_DEVICE, NULL,
                US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY ),
More information on these sources:
http://packages.gentoo.org/ebuilds/?gentoo-dev-sources-2.6.5-r1
I found it in no other branch besides this.
So if you include my patch then you might consider putting his name
there too. I discovered his entry after I figured out by myself how to
make EagleTec revision 1.13 work, but I don't know whether he did it
before me.
regards,
Tobias
