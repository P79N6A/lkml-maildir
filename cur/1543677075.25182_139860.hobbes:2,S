Hi Philip, long time no see :-)
Yes, you are right.
Will be sending a patch to Greg shortly.
Couple of other things have to be fixed as well.
Just realized that temp scaling is wrong.
Should be scaling by 1000 not 100.
(Gee, and that after I had mailed Greg that a couple of other sensors
get it wrong)
