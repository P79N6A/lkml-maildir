Marko do not point to the in kernel w6692 driver, but to the (still ALPHA)
mISDN driver from cvs.isdn4linux.de.
This driver had a problem with the pci_register_driver return code changes
in 2.6.10, it now always returns 0 (if no error), but < 2.6.10 did return
the number of detected devices, which was tested in this driver.
This is fixed since last week in our CVS.
