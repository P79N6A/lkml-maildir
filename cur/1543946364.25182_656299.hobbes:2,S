Nothing. Not even after I removed the alsa-usb-audio driver. All I see 
is Keyboard.*, but the events from the speaker should be Key.*, right?
It looks like the speaker goes into a different mode once the USB cable 
is plugged in. Without the USB cable, the Z-10 acts as simple/dumb 
speaker, the volume up/down buttons change the internal volume, and I 
see that on the display, too. The play/next/prev song buttons don't do 
anything, which is quite obvious.
But once the USB cable is plugged in, the volume up/down buttons stop 
reacting. I assume they are now meant to send events to the computer so 
that some software can decide what to do. But features that are not 
useful for the computer (bass/treble), can still be controlled using the 
buttons on the speaker. The buttons are not dead. I can see that because 
the display goes to sleep after a few seconds of inactivity, and when I 
press the volume buttons, it wakes up and displays the current volume. 
So the speaker is definitely seeing that the buttons are being pressed.
Is there a USB packet inspector/dumper, like libpcap for network?
