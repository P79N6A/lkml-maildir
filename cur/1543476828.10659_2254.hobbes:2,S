OK, implementation was easy and simple, much simpler than it was made
before (with BH_Touched copying...), but I must admit that even after
lots of testing I couldn't find any difference. Not in performance,
not in CPU usage, not in overall behaviour. Whatever results I have
accomplished, they were too much in the statistical noise, so I don't
have any useful data. Maybe, others can try and see.
But, nevertheless, four lines added to the kernel look very correct to
me. My vote for including, if for nothing, then to make balance with
page cache. It won't harm anything, that's for sure. Patch applies
cleanly on pre-7, as found in testing directory on ftp.kernel.org.
