cp(1) data, at least, will never ever be in L1.  Copying data you need 
to look at the ends of the pipeline -- hard drive throughput, PCI bus 
bandwidth, FSB bandwidth, speed at which ext2/3 allocates blocks, and 
similar things are likely bottlenecks.
You'll never hit RAM bandwidth limits, unless your copies are extremely 
tiny, and entirely in L2 or pagecache.
