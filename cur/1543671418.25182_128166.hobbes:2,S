unfortunately you want those dozen parameters, they all have a purpose...
which is what makes such a call suspect in the first place.
vfork() solves the mm copying problem, which eliminates half the reason
for a combined fork-exec syscall.
the only time fork-exec is inefficient, given the existence of vfork, is
when you need to fork a process which has a lot of fd.  and by "a lot" i
mean thousands.
in that case even F_CLOEXEC isn't a good answer -- because it's a pain in
the ass to set because it requires an extra system call for the most
important case -- sockets.  otherwise you have to iterate over the entire
fd array to close things... which isn't so hot for multiprocessor setups.
but even this has a potential work-around using procfs -- use clone() to
get the vfork semantics without also copying the fd array.  then open
/proc/$ppid/fd/N for any file descriptors you want opened in the forked
process.
given both vfork and procfs i'm not sure there's any other performance
benefit a combined fork+exec syscall offers...  and if procfs isn't fast
enough for this then that's a better place to focus effort :)
