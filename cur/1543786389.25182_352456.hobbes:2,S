Hmm.. I don't feel it is that new, but maybe that's because I've used that 
trick in other places. I think it's pretty common in a "type-safe C" way, 
and it should probably be encouraged. A unique pointer type for special 
usages, that you can't dereference even by mistake..
But adding a few comments might certainly be worth it. If only to teach 
others the trick.
