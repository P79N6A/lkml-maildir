This one should really be 
compat_ulong_t __user *uval = compat_ptr(arg);
It's not really a problem since the only architecture where compat_ptr()
makes a difference (64 bit s390) doesn't have an RTC driver, but it
should be changed nevertheless.
Also, I suppose the declaration of val is wrong, since the ioctl methods
expect a pointer to an unsigned long, not a compat_ulong_t. If you
change that, the copy_in_user() won't work either.
