Subject: ACPI: ibm-acpi: fix initial status of backlight device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The brightness class core does not update the initial status of
the device's brightness at register time.  Do it by ourselves
before we register the class device.

NOTE: This patch needs an ACK from Richard Purdie before it can be merged,
as he might want to change the backlight class code instead.
