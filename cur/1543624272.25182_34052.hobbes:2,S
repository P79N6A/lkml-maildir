Just from curious, I have implemented the userland gettimeofday
as a shared library.  It runs about ten times faster than the
system call on my PC, Pentium4 1.5GHz, Linux-2.4.18-pre9-ac3.
The benchmark program says:
  system call: 1.226556 usec/call
  userland   : 0.133730 usec/call, (usec = micro second = 0.000001 sec)
It is available from:
  
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~obatan/ugettime/ugettime-0.1.1.tar.gz
You have to run calibration program "calib" first.  Then compile
a shared library ugettime.so, in which these calibrated
parameters are embedded as constants.  (So you need to recompile
it whenever you reboot the system. :-)  Please read README to
see how to use it.
Preloading this library enables the userland gettimeofday.  For
example,
  $ LD_PRELOAD=./ugettime.so emacs
will execute emacs and all gettimeofday system calls that emacs
issues will be handled by ./ugettime.so.
Patient calibration gives you very accurate userland
gettimeofday if your original gettimeofday and TSC on your
system has good enough precision.
I'm running verification program for 18 hours, but the userland
gettimeofday still synchronizes with the actual system call.

Yes, it is just for fun...  Enjoy!
