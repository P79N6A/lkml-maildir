Well all I actually did was simply stick #define HAVE_PPSAPI at the tome
of the refclock_nmea.c file.  The configure script in ntp is explcitly
checking for PPS API version 1 so version 2 doesn't match and it claims
you don't have a timepps.h file it can use.  Unfortunately I really have
trouble understanding autoconf scripts and can't figure out where the
code is that tells it how to do the check for timepps.h and the API
version inside it.

I will try out the ppstest tool.
How come none of the .patch files in
http://ftp.enneenne.com/pub/misc/linuxpps/refclocks/nmea/
 can be
accessed?  Does your web server not like serving up .patch files?
