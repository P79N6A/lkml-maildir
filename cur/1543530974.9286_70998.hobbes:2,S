"Cannot handle the load"? If you overload it, then problems occur.
Next time the DoD is purchasing transport aircraft, we'll try
drop-testing them all from 45 000 feet, then refuse to buy the ones
which "cannot handle the load"...
The system operates correctly within the specified limits. If you
overload it, it cannot fulfil all the demands put on it and fails
partially in some well-defined way.

There is some data. It is not adequate to make a PERFECT decision;
some friendly casualties will occur. Until better resource accounting
is available, this can't be improved much. Either way, overcommitting
memory helps.
