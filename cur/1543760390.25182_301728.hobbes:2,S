Hmm..  We fixed this already, and the current tree doesn't have this 
problem (and the fix was much simpler: just move "switch_uid()" to outside 
the tasklist_lock.
That fix was done late december last year (current BK revision: 
1.1938.446.38), and I really think your patch is stale. Please 
double-check,
