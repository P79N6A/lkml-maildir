You can use floating point; you just have to make sure to 
save the FP context explicitely and disable preemption. Details
on how to do this vary by architecture.
The problem is that FP code typically takes often a lot of CPU time
and it is quite antisocial to disable preemption for a long time
because that impacts real time latency for everybody.
Besides many uses can be relatively easily rewritten to fixed
point.
