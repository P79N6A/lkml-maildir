For anyone who doesn't grok CRKM-speak, as I didn't until some recent
conversations with Hubertus, I think this roughly translates into the
following:
"CKRM & sched_domains should be integrated and include management of
both CPU & memory resources.  We will use the CKRM rcfs filesystem API
to set up both sched_domains and memory allocation constraints.
sched_domains that are marked as exclusive, ie: their parent domains do
not have the SD_LOAD_BALANCE flag set, will not have their computing
power shared outside that domain via CKRM.  This will create 'compute
pools' composed of the exclusive domains in the system.  CKRM will
ensure that 'shares' are correctly handled within exclusive (aka
isolated) domains, and that 'shares' don't include compute resources not
available in the sched_domain in question."
Is that a fairly accurate translation for those not initiated in the
ways of CKRM, Hubertus?
