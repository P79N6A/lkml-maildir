A few things..
Are your other filesystems using journalled data as well?
Are you sure that all kernel files were recompiled?  If,
for example, you had some 2.5.11 objects in the link, that
would be bad.
Do you know whether the bad data is actually on-disk, or
could it be just in-RAM?  ie: was the data still bad after
a reboot?
What blocksize is that filesystem using?  The output of
`dumpe2fs -h /dev/whatever' will tell you this.
Can you please force an fsck against that filesystem,
see what it says?
Thanks.
