I've used linux for about 8 years now. The only time I've had a catastrophic
failure was with a disk drive went south.
About the only times I've seen ext2fs require manual repair is a crash/power
failure during fsck on boot. It doesn't happen very often. Even then, it
may not be a serious falure, just the type of error that requires a choice
in fix - missing inode/partially written inode in the root file system will
usually require the choice of deleting, or putting in lost+found.
No file system is immune to that level of failure. Some are better at
hiding the damage (xfs will lose free data blocks like mad - 3 in a row lost
6GB out of 12, though no used data was (visibly) lost.
15 minutes isn't that bad - wait until you have to spend 30 minutes to
3 hours on an NTFS or FAT32 rebuild, only to find you have to reinstall.
