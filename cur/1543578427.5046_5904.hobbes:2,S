And make sure your ftp client/server isn't resetting it to something small
afterwards. For testing this, I'd use a real IP benchmarking program
like iperf/netperf/ttcp, as they'll let you test different buffer sizes
easily (and in the case of iperf tell you what you're actually using
if you hit the limit) For a fast WAN you want something like 
512k-1M buffers easily.
