yes, it is easy to patch sys_call_table[] on the fly from a module. Do
this:
a) download my old timetravel module to learn how to do it:
   
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/tt/tt.html
b) find some unused slot in sys_call_table[]. Look in
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S for sys_ni_syscall entries (ni means not
implemented) but beware that you are not alone there - i.e. some other
people are already using those "unused" entries for precisely this
purpose - usually comments next to them are descriptive enough.
c) write a module that replaces a chosen (well-known to
you) sys_ni_syscall entry with your sys_getcmdline(). You can't do it
dynamically because then you will have to invent some means of passing the
system call number back from the module to userspace - this could be done
via a simple file in /proc - oops we wanted to have no proc, so... :)
d) write a (I meant steal from asm/unistd.h) a _syscall1() interface to
your syscall.
e) done.
