If memory serves, you change your xorg.conf's "Device" section's  
"Driver" entry to read:
"nv"
instead of
"nvidia",
although I would consult the xorg documentation/your distribution's  
documentation (and back up your working xorg.conf) for specific  
details. (Your boot sequence may also automatically load the nvidia  
module, again, consult your distribution's documentation for details.)
Cheers/hope this helps,
