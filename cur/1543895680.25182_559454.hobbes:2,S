I've never denied this possibility.
But how about all the other devices that are being tivoized that do
NOT require this?
Are people just blind to this possibility?  Or does it really not
exist, and I'm the first who ever though of it?

How is it good that the vendor can downgrade the software behind the
user's back?
Oh, yeah, right, it could upgrade it too.

Actually, no.  I'm advocating for respect for users' freedoms.
Whoever choose not to do that gets slightly hurt in the process, as an
incentive for respecting users' freedoms.  And yes, when the users'
freedoms are not respected (the cases you mentioned), that's bad for
the user, no doubt.  And bad for the community as well.
