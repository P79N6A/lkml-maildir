I just spent a month tracking down this issue.  It comes
down to the slab allocater using per cpu data structures and
protecting them with a combination of interrupt disables and
spin_locks.  Preemption is allowed (incorrectly) if
interrupts are off and preempt_count goes to zero on the
spin_unlock.  I will wager that this is an SMP machine. 
After the preemption interrupts will be on (schedule() does
that) AND you could be on a different cpu.  Either of these
is a BAD thing.
The proposed fix is to catch the attempted preemption in
preempt_schedule() and just return if the interrupt system
is off.  (Of course there is more that this to it, but I do
believe that the problem is known.  You could blow this
assertion out of the water by asserting that the machine is
NOT smp.)
