No.
We do not create wrappers "so that we can easily change the implementation
when xxx happens".
That way lies bad implementations.
We do the _good_ implementation first, and then we create the
"kcompat-2.4" file later that makes people able to use the good
implementation.
Why this way? Because wrapping for wrappings sake just makes code
unreadable (see acpi), and often makes it less obvious what you actually
_have_ to do, and what you don't. So get the design right _first_, and
once the design is right, _then_ you worry about kcompat-2.4.
