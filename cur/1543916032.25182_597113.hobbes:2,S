Hi!
> > Seems like good enough for -mm to me.
(For the record, I do not think this is going to be
hibernation-replacement any time soon. But it is functionality useful
for other stuff -- dump memory and continue -- and yes it may be able
to do hibernation in the long term.
It really comes from the other side of reliability:
* swsusp is "if your kernel is perfectly healthy, it will work"
while this, coming from kdump is
* "if your kernel is not completely trashed, it should work"
...which is why can't use swsusp to do dump memory and continue -- you
want to do dumps on "slightly broken" systems. And yes, as a
sideeffect it may be able to do hibernation... why not, lets see how
it works out).
