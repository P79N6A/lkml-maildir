I've decided to have another try at getting my OMTI 8627 controller usable
under Linux.
It works fine under DOS with no special driver so I assume it's not too far
from standard.
I tried compiling in 'old disk-only driver' and manually specifying the
geometry on the command line.  It just keeps giving unexpected interrupts with
status=0xff, error=0xff.  I found some docs which say that certain memory
locations on the PC are meaningful except with ESDI when they are 0xff.
However they didn't say where the meaningful data for ESDI is.
This card also works fine with VSTa - I assume through BIOS routines.
Any suggestions for the best approach to try and get it working?  The machine
it's in would make a good little dialup router or something if it would
work :-)
