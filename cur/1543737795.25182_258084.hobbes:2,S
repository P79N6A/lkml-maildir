No, in fact. You're right...
Indeed, if there was a deadlock, it would also happen when cable is
plugged in, wouldn't it ? (as sungem outputs "Link is up at xxx..." or
something when correctly initialized).

I'll try. 
The called method in the driver when calling 
  dev_change_flags(ndev, ndev->flags | IFF_UP) from netpoll
is
  gem_open(), if I'm not mistaken?
Could some kind of infinite loop happen within gem_link_timer, maybe ?
