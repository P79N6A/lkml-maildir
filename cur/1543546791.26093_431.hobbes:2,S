WTF "frozen"? Does
% cat
leave the process frozen? Not? If your read() is uninterruptably blocked -
too fscking bad, but close() is unlikely to get you out of that. If it
isn't - what are you complaining about?

OK, should unlink("foo"); terminate truncate("foo", 1);?

Alexey, I'm afraid that I've got a surprise for you. Say rmdir `pwd`
and see if the inode gets released. It doesn' and it shouldn't. Nothing
is getting hung, indeed.

Excuse me? Sorry, but you've totally misread that code. If the last owner
of mm_struct exits while the thing is in use by some processor running
lazy-TLB process... Guess what - mm_struct hangs around until the next
context switch to non-lazy beast. On all CPUs that had it.
