sorry if the "hash table" thing got in the way of my real point -- that
is, perhaps socket management can be more memory-efficient.  it may have
made sense a while ago to create an inode for each socket before there
were dentries, and before you could create more than 4K sockets per
system.  nowadays i think it is wasteful and introduces DoS and system
instability where one might expect normal behavior.  administrators need
to be aware of how to set their fd and socket maximums, and what can
happen if they don't set them appropriately -- this is now a security
issue.
reading the earlier note on changes in solaris to allow more sockets, it
sounds as if sun encountered the same kind of scalability issue.
