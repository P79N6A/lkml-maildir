i have released the -U9.3 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this too is a fixes-only release.
Changes since -U9.2:
 - tons more driver/mutex/completion conversion done by Thomas Gleixner 
   for: ppp, ipmi, parport/ieeee1284, scsi, hotplug, and more.
 - iptables/netfilter deadlock fix, this should fix the bug reported by 
   Michal Schmidt.
 - .config housekeeping: disallow the turning off of PREEMPT_BKL when 
   PREEMPT_REALTIME is on. This solves the build error reported by 
   Matthew L Foster.
 - print the full stacktrace of the current task in the deadlock 
   detector and dont use show_stack(). This explains some of the weird
   partial stackdumps reported.
 - some more minor updates to the case when the deadlock detector turns
   itself off due to reaching the limit. We kept the spinlock locked.
to create a -U9.3 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
