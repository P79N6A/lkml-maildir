Despite whatever political wrangling there is between userspace and
kernelspace implementations (and some very valid points about other
arches), there is still a dearth of testing, as far as I can see.
I can't see anything wrong with making it a config option for now,
and letting people choose what they want to do, until we have more
information as to which performs better under a variety of workloads. 
That seems the most pragmatic way forward.
