Mike, any chance you can turn your series of patches into one that
applies atop mingo's intra-timeslice priority preemption patch? If
not, I suppose someone else could.
There also appears to be some kind of issue with using monotonic_clock()
with timer_pit as well as some locking overhead concerns. Something
should probably be done about those things before trying to merge the
fine-grained time accounting patch.
