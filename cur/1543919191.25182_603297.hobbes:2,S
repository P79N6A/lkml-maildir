Erm, a bit of googling will turn one up, but the gist is that IBM has
traditionally bit 0 for MSB and x for LSB.  It's a pain to work with:
for one, bits in the same place in a word (say, control register) are
renumbered in 32 vs 64.  And I've worked on at least one piece of
hardware in which the hardware designer had a brain-fart and first board
had bit 0 on the CPU wired to bit 0 on the northbridge - should have
been 31 -> 0, 30 -> 1, etc...
