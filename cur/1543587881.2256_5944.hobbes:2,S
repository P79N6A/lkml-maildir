How is this likely to affect applications?
Currently, the glibc2.1 sendfile interface looks like:
ssize_t sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count);
On error, -1 is returned in the usual fashion and offset is purported to be
updated to point to the next byte following the last one sent.
Will the zerocopy patches break this?
