	What "standard makecompat for devfsd"?  I can't find anything on my
system, on Richard's pages, in the devfsd sources, or in the kernel sources
by that name.  Pray tell what is this "standard".  Maybe I've missed
something again.  Unless it's under some other name...
	Maybe this is the secret cookie we've all been looking for.  Where
is it and what is it?
