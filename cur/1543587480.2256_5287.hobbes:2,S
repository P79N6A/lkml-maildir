inner loop, i.e. interrupt timer code should never have to convert from some
real time value into number of decrementer ticks in order to set up the next
interrupt as that requires devides (and 64 bit ones at that) in a tickless
system.
this is why any variable interval list/heap/tree/whatever should be kept in
local ticks.  frequently used values can be pre-computed at boot time to
speed up certain calculations (like how many local ticks/proc quantum)
