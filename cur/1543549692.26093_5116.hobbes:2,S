You still have to do all the object maintainance yourself, plus you have no
clean-up-on-death code for certain circumstances (eg: SIGKILL).
How do you propose WaitFor*() should be implemented? Wait queues are hard to
do efficiently in userspace...

Why? I personally want all requests to be as fast as possible, if only to
trounce Windows at its own game:->

Best is as fine-grained as possible (which I've tried to do).
