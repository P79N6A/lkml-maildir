This order is correct. There can never be parallel access to the
same _instance_ of tipc_ret_table.entries[index]->lock from
the two functions you mention.
Note that tipc_deleteport() takes as argument the reference (=index)
returned from tipc_ref_acquire(), so  it can not be (and is not) called
until and unless the latter function has returned a valid reference.
As a parallel, you can't do free() on a memory chunk until
malloc() has given you a pointer to it.

I suspect you are mixing up things here. 
We are handling two different reference entries and two
different locks in this function.
One reference entry points to a subscription instance, and its
reference (index) is obtainable from subscriber->ref. So, we
could easily lock the entry if needed. However, in this
particular case it is unnecessary, since there is no chance that
anybody else could have obtained the new reference, and
hence no risk for race conditions.
The other reference entry was intended to point to a new port,
but, since we didn't obtain any reference in the first place,
there is no port to delete and no reference to discard.
