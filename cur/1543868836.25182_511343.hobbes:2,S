Ah, ok.  It is deadlock free, if the maximal height of your tree is 2.
It is not 100% deadlock free if the height is 3 or more.
Also, I strongly suspect that your tree is higher than 2.  A medium
sized directory will have data blocks, indirect blocks and the inode
proper, which gives you a height of 3.  Your inodes need to get accessed
somehow and unless they have fixed positions like in ext2, you need a
further tree structure of some sorts, so you're more likely looking at a
height of 5.
With a height of 5, you would need to keep 80% of you metadata free.
That is starting to get wasteful.
So I suspect that my proposed alternate cleaner mechanism or the even
better "hole plugging" mechanism proposed in the paper a few posts above
would be a better path to follow.

Actually, no.  It is the common case for LogFS because it is designed
for flash media.  Unlike hard disks, flash lifetime is limited by the
amount of data written to it.  Therefore, having a cleaner run when the
filesystem is idle would cause unnecessary writes and reduce lifetime.
As a result, the LogFS cleaner runs as lazily as possible and the
filesystem tries hard not to mix data with different lifetimes in one
segment.  LogFS tries to avoid the cleaner like the plague.  But if it
ever needs to run it, the deadlock scenario is very close and I need to
be very aware of it. :)
In a way, the DualFS approach does not change rules for the
log-structured filesystem at all.  If you had designed your filesystem
in such a way that you simply used two existent filesystems and wrote
Actual Data (AD) to one, Metadata (MD) to another, what is MD to DualFS
is plain data to one of your underlying filesystems.  It can cause a bit
of confusion, because I tend to call MD "data" and you tend to call AD
"data", but that is about all.
