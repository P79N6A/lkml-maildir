The general idea behind VM is pretty simple: keep the most frequently used 
pages in the fastest storage possible. The tar backup pushed a lot of pages 
that looked more frequently used in to RAM, and swapped out programs that 
weren't being used at all in favour of this cache. Now that the backup is 
completed, and only a small portion of the cache you used for backup is being 
used, these unused cache pages can very easily be 'given up' to be used as 
free memory again. A VM that -doesn't care- if it's dealing with program 
pages, buffer pages, shared memory, or cache pages when making swapping 
decisions is much more robust than a VM that tries to 'outsmart' itself.
