The linux-2.4.20 contains 516 references to "sleep_on" in the
`drivers` tree. This is hardly a function or macro that will
be removed. If there are bugs, they will be fixed, not removed.
Any driver that makes its own 'sleep until' function is fundamentally
broken. A driver should not 'know' about 'schedule()' or any
other such thing. This violates a fundamental rule about keeping
opaque operations and/or functions opaque. If course, older
drivers do 'know' about schedule(), but that doesn't make them
correct. If you intend to replace these 'sleep until' operations,
then that's wonderful. However, until you do, it would not be
wise to ask anybody to roll their own.
And, if you are actually making a replacement, it should be
a function, not a macro. This will save a lot of space. Anything
that is going to wait is not going to be hurt by the call/return
overhead.

Again, this is incorrect. If you look at the declaration of schedule(),
you will note "asmlinkage void schedule(void);". Now look up
"asmlinkage"
#define asmlinkage CPP_ASMLINKAGE __attribute__((regparm(0)))
The regparm(0) atttibute tells gcc that schedule() will get any/all
of its parameters in registers. Since schedule() receives no parameters,
that means that, as far as gcc is concerned, it cannot modify
anything. That said, this may be a bug or it may have been added
to work around some gcc bug. But, nevertheless, as the declaration
stands, schedule() will never modify anything because somebody told
gcc it won't.
