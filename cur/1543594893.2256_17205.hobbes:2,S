Hi,
    I get the source code of aic7xxx  untar it in my Linux Kernel directory
and go to the directory "/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx" to make
aic7xxx_mod.o.
  But i cannot make the modules. The error is as follows:
  My Linux is RedHat 6.2 and kernel version is 2.2.14-5.0 .
   Please give me some instructions to achieve it.
    Best Regards
    Warren
