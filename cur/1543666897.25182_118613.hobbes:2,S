Very good point. Some of the loads are exhibiting better overall cpu usage and 
dropping the compile time (tar loads are a good example)

I dont think there are other tweaks in mm2 that could be responsible. It's 
extremely hard to know what exactly is the best balance in this load. If 
dbench 16 should get 80% of the total cpu usage (since the kernel compile has 
4 processes) then mm2 is very close at 78%. However I didnt think dbench was 
supposed to be a particularly cpu bound task. The overall cpu usage is higher 
which is good though.
