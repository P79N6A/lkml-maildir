Your first patch behaves much better as the second. It seems that my drives are running with PIO only again. I see no problems with your first patch.
cdparanoia with ide-akpm-1:
/dev/scd0: (CPU ~40%)
	real    1m10.194s
	user    0m6.560s
	sys     0m2.880s
/dev/scd1: (CPU ~40%)
	real    2m8.283s
	user    0m7.230s
	sys     0m3.890s
cdparanoia with ide-akpm-2:
/dev/scd0: (CPU ~80%)
	real    1m37.472s
	user    0m7.340s
	sys     0m3.290s

	sys     0m3.620s
dd if=/dev/scd0 of=test.iso:
And dd consumes about 5% CPU with your first patch and almost 90% with your second patch as I would disable dma on it (and the system gets really slow responding).
My specs:
hdc: LTN526S, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdd: Hewlett-Packard CD-Writer Plus 9100b, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
I'm using ide-scsi:
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  Vendor: LITEON    Model: CD-ROM LTN526S    Rev: YS0A
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  Vendor: HP        Model: CD-Writer+ 9100b  Rev: 1.06
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
I'm using 2.4.18-pre3-ac2. Maybe there're some collisions with Andre's IDE patches ?
