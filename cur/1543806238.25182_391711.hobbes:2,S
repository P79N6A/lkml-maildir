Well, it would give at least one object from the new slab to the critical
request, but you're right, the rest of the slab could be allocated to
non-critical users.  I had planned on a small follow-on patch to add
exclusivity to mempool/critical slab pages, but going a different route
seems to be the consensus.

Mempools aren't sufficient because in order to create a real critical pool
for the whole networking subsystem, we'd have to create dozens of mempools,
one each for all the different slabs & kmalloc sizes the networking stack
requires, plus another for whole pages.  Not impossible, but U-G-L-Y.  And
wasteful.  Creating all those mempools is surely more wasteful than
creating one reasonably sized pool to back ALL the allocations.  Or, at
least, such was my rationale... :)
