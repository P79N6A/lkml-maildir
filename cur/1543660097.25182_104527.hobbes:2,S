Looking real good. I just tried this on a machine that couldn't stay up 
for more than an hour with 2.4.21-pre3-ac4. I performed a number of disk 
intensive tasks, any one of which had a near 100% chance of crashing the 
box, and no problem so far. I'll keep running it and let you know if I 
see any problems.
Thanks you.
