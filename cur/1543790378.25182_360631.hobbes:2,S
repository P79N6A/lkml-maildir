Was 'no such file', perhaps the device file was not created by `mkrootdev`
because it errored out???
This is all 'Fedora' stuff, not Linux stuff. You should upgrade
your 'mkinitrd' (or rewrite it) so it doesn't use Fedora-specific
stuff if you intend to install an un-patched kernel.

Means 'wrong value'. Probably because the new root wasn't
mounted.

In the meantime do:
mknod /dev/sda6 b 8 6
mknod /dev/root b 8 6
.. in your initrd script. This should get you past the errors.
