Can you please split the watermark changes from 05_vm_rest-10 and send me
that ? (no waitqueue changes, no page wakeup logic changes)
As I said previously, lets start with the page reclaiming logic changes 
first, which include:
05_vm_03_vm_tunables-4
05_vm_05_zone_accounting-2
05_vm_06_swap_out-3 
And the necessary (ONLY watermark stuff AFAICS) from 05_vm_rest-10. 
Right?
Thanks
