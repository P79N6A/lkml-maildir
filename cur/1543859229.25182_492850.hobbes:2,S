Hmm,
but we would still waste a lot of memory compared to kmalloc,
when the amount of memory needed is much less than one page, which tends 
to be
a very common case.
Unless we allow the first entry in the array to be the virtual adress to an
arbitrary-sized (max one page) kmalloc() area, the rest of the entries 
can be pointers
to pages allocated with __get_free_page().
This would almost introduce the same level of confusion as the original 
proposal,
and effectively we'd be doing virtual address translation in software 
for each access.
