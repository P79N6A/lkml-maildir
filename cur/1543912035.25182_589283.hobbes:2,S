I'm not sure if I understand your approach correctly.
This approach may reduce the number of interrupts, but it does so
by blocking the CPU for up to 1 jiffy (that can be quite some time
on some platforms). So no other application / tasklet / softIRQ type
can do anything in between. The CPU utilization does not drop at all, 
and I thought that is one reason why we try to reduce the number of interrupts.

Waiting for N polls seems to make no sense if there are no further network adapters
in that machine. It would take no time to call poll N times in a row when no
new packets arrive. There is no real delay as the net_rx_action function will
do nothing else between the poll calls.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
