The so called 4K stack patch does add more stack safety.  Avoiding the
possibility of allocation failures due to memory fragmentation.  Besides,
the patch is really misnamed; it should have been called the split-stack
(ie. 4K + 4K).   Since nobody can show any area in the mainline code where
the split stack scheme introduces a problem the old setup should be
removed as it is no longer needed by the mainline code.
I for one hope those silly bastards using ndiswrapper fix up that code to
work with the new kernel so that we can stop hearing all these wannabe
complaints against this progress.
