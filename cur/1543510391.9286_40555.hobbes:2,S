The "No such device" message can be very misleading.  For normal files
it means that the filename does not exist.  For special files it can
mean that the filename does not exist but it is more likely that the
kernel code that runs when you open the special file has detected an
error.  Unfortunately a kernel error also comes back as "No such
device".  You probably have an I/O or IRQ problem, take it up with the
ESS Solo developers.
