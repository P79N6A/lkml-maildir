Hi!
I noticed both the 2.4 and 2.5 BK->CVS trees don't have version tags
any more (v2_5_70, for example, as in the old tree).
Is this intentional? Did CVS take too long to tag all files or something?
It was quite a nice feature to have them, very useful for finding out the
differences between certain kernel versions. I can live without it, 
though. It's still a nice service without the tags. (Thanks!)
