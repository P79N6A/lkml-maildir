ah, indeed. if we have the same section name but different attributes 
then i guess gas/ld resolves the conflict by auto-generating these 
.1/.2, etc. artificial sections. They dont show up in the vmlinux 
because they went through the linker scripts that merges them into a 
single output section. But modpost picks up those pre-merge names.

Peter pointed me to "info gas", which has a "Sections and Relocation" 
chapter.
