glad that I stimulated a philosophical discussion
about the kernel header files and what they should
include or not ... 
but the idea was more to give the developers an
instrument to verify that they are not including
stuff several times, and that's actually in .h
and .c files, because it seems that often the same
header file is included twice in the _same_ file
anyway, was this a positive or negative reply?
TIA,
Herbert
