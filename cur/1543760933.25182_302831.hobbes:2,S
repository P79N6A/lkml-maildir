Is the qla2xxx dirver not capable of fail over support?  under
Documentation/* for the qla2xxx release notes, it says in a earlier
revision that fail over was made optional.  Was the optional support
removed?  If it is capable of fail over, what are the means of
enable/accessing the ability?
Thanks,
Ben
