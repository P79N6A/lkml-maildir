a few months ago i estimated the costs of this and it's just a few 
terabytes so within arm's reach. As long as the .deb/.rpm's are built by 
tracking -git in a rolling fashion CPU time should not be a big issue. 
The only limit is download bandwidth - but even that problem might be 
solvable via a huge git repository of ready-to-boot .o's that are linked 
together on the tester's machine.
