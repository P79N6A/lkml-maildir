I presume Ted is referring to problems guaranteeing the integrity of
the journal at recovery time. I am coming into this without all the
available context, so I may be barking up the wrong tree.... In
particular, I am not sure how journaling whole blocks protects
you from this.
The xfs journal protects itself against partial writes, to a certain
degree. The header of a journal write (inside a 512 byte sector)
contains an array of words which are swapped out from the start of
each following 512 byte sector of the journal write. The following
sectors then each have the log sequence number (LSN) of the write inserted
in place of that data.
During recovery, we find the most recent LSN via a binary chop
search, this gives us an associated tail LSN. A scan backwards
from the head LSN is then done - this covers the total possible
amount of in flight data (maximum log buffers x maximum log buffer
size). If any of the sectors has the wrong LSN in the first word,
then it an all following data is discarded from replay. Of course,
we will also not replay any journal entry for which we do not find
the transaction commit record.
Now, this protects against some failure cases, it assumes that
sector writes are atomic, they either happen or they do not
happen. If sector writes are not atomic and one end can be
good with the other is bad, then a partial sector is possibly
going to get replayed. There have been discussions about doing
this with the head and tail of each sector, or using a checksum
instead.
XFS on linux has had power cycle crash testing, but there is no
way you can cover all possible hardware configurations, and I
seem to recall some hardware never recovered from this testing,
by that I mean the PC did not survive the continual power cycling
and went up in smoke.
