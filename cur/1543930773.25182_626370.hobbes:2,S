Hi,
Why do we need so many different flags for preserving different types
of state (CPU, CPU_EXT, Device, console) ? To keep things simple,
can't we can create just one flag KEXEC_PRESERVE_CONTEXT, which will
indicate any special action required for preserving the previous kernel's
context so that one can swith back to old kernel?
Thanks
Vivek
