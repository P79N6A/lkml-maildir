I haven't tested this <yet>, but this is not mandatory because the
standard says "should". I know that some older versions of SunOs would
"announce" when they saw such an address on the wire. This was once
found to come from an incorrectly-configured INTERACTIVE Unix machine
here.
You will need root privs to use `ifconfig` and the same to write
raw packets from user-mode so I don't think you have a problem
with the kernel not, as you say, enforcing the standard. Of course,
of everybody has root, then they can do anything regardless of any
kernel enforcement. Just write raw packets claiming you are from
whitehouse.gov and you can rule the universe.
Cheers,
