No, you're not.  I think Alan's just saying the gid based checks
are suboptimal if there's a cleaner way to do it (to which I agree).
Personally, I don't have a big problem with the Realtime LSM.  I've helped
you with it, and suggested a few times that I'd prefer it to be generic;
but never stepped up to deliver code of that sort.  Since it's your itch,
you've scratched it, and it's quite simple and contained, I consider
it acceptable.
thanks,
