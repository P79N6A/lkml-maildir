I'm using APM && apmd, but it seems it does nothing. Now I'll test without apm
module && apmd unloaded.
Well, there's a strange thing: I have two drives:
/dev/hda on /boot,
/dev/hdc on /
If i do hdparm -Y /dev/hda, without apm loaded, hda stops, i can't awake it. hdc remains working.
Now, if i do hdparm -Y /dev/hdc i can sleep && awake hdc. But sometimes, when hda is working (or not)
and with/without apm loaded the system stops, and hdc doesn't awake. I'm getting crazy.
Now when I try to mount the ide cdrom, mount keeps hanged, too.

I didn't know, i just read the hdparm manual, which doesn't says that.
