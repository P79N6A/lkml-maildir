We can probably assume that for whatever reason the two things with
duplicate UUID had the same seed. If not, we've got -much- bigger
problems.

Hmmm, a kernel where the fingered bug is already fixed.
So what's being used for the seed here? I assume you either ship all
CDs with no seed file or the same seed file, yes? That leaves utsname,
presumably a constant across a large number of machines and time of day.
Still possible, I suppose, that's it's 931 boxes booted with the same
time of day. How many total machines are you tracking?
If it is a time of day weirdness (ie N machines with dead CMOS
batteries or no CMOS clock at all), then you'd expect to see a normal
distribution of collisions around the average time to get to the
initialization function, with a rapid falloff on either side. Or,
looked at from a histogram of collision counts, a round peak rapidly
rolling off.
Other failure modes would tend to give you a much more uniform (and
therefore likely invisible) distribution.

Some bastard snuck a patch in to use ktime_get_real() in the pool init
function, so we should have nanosecond resolution here, but only a) if
TSC actually works and b) if all the clock sources get initialized
before the RNG. Otherwise, we might be using jiffies or worse here.
