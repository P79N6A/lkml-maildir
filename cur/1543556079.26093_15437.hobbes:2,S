Hmmm. Memory corruption (shows up in the args of a traced httpd process
sitting on it's stack), concurrent with pci busmastering ethernet yes,
concurrent with localhost connect to same server no (just tried it
with 20 times the number of connects from local client that reliably
hang it over ethernet, didn't flinch; same SIGCHLD during accept()
events showed in the log, but never with the httpd parent's stack
corrupted after accept() restarted).
Dma error? On connect only? (Doesn't happen during 100mb ftp transfers.)
(The ethernet card does support dma buffer management.)
