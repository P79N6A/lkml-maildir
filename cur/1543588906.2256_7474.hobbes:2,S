Hi Al,
  I believe your patch introduces a race for the NFS case. The problem
lies in the fact that nfs_find_actor() needs to read several of the
fields from nfs_inode_info. By adding an allocation after the inode
has been hashed, you are creating a window during which the inode can
be found by find_inode(), but during which you aren't even guaranteed
that the nfs_inode_info exists let alone that it's been initialized
by nfs_fill_inode().
One solution could be to have find_inode sleep on encountering a
locked inode. It would have to be something along the lines of
static struct inode * find_inode(struct super_block * sb, unsigned long ino, struct list_head *head, find_inode_t find_actor, void *opaque)
{
        struct list_head *tmp;
        struct inode * inode;
        tmp = head;
        for (;;) {
                tmp = tmp->next;
                inode = NULL;
                if (tmp == head)
                        break;
                inode = list_entry(tmp, struct inode, i_hash);
                if (inode->i_ino != ino)
                        continue;
                if (inode->i_sb != sb)
                        continue;
                if (find_actor) {
                        if (inode->i_state & I_LOCK) {
                                spin_unlock(&inode_lock);
                                __wait_on_inode(inode);
                                spin_lock(&inode_lock);
                                tmp = head;
                                continue;
                        }
                        if (!find_actor(inode, ino, opaque))
                                continue;
                }
                break;
        }
        return inode;
}
