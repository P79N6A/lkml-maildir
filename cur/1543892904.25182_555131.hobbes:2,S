static struct lock_class lock_classes[MAX_LOCKDEP_KEYS];
I assume this gets us class structures containing all zeros, doesn't it?
Then class->stat is zeros as well, which is handled by lib/statistics.
(In this case, data gathering hasn't been turned on yet, and statistic_inc()
and similar functions don't access other areas of struct statistic.)
