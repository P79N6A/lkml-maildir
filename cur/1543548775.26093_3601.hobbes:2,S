Don't you want to do it a megabyte at a time to prevent abyssimal
disk-performance? (i.e. take the separate megabytes backwards, but do
every megabyte forwards)
instead of 
	for (b=max;b>0;b--) 
do 
           for (bb=max-STEP;bb > 0 ; bb -= STEP)
	 	for (b=bb;b<bb+STEP;b++)
(sloppy coding! this is pseudocde, don't copy-paste.)
I expect about 120 IO operations of say 4k (480k per sec) out of a
disk if you read strictly backwards. While you can get about 18 IOs of
1Mb per second (18M per second) out of a disk that you run a
(forwards) megabyte at a time.
The extra latency in the "elevator" is then the time to read a
megabyte, about 50ms, which sounds acceptable to me.
