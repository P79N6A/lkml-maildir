I think I'm suffering the same thing on my new Asus A7V. Yesterday I got a
single "error in bitmap, remounting read only" type error, and today I got
some files in /tmp that returned I/O error when stat()ed. I do have DMA
enabled, but only UDMA33. I've done several kernel compiles with no
problems at all so looks like something is on the edge. Think I might go
back to 2.2.x for a bit and see what happens, or maybe just remove the VIA
driver :-((.
P.
I've attached lspci -vxxx output, and kernel config, in case anyone is
investigating.
/dev/hda is Seagate ST330621A.
