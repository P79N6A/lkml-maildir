Is that a good solution? I'm not sure if it is wise to try to
masquerade SCHED_ISO as an unprivileged RT class.
I mean what happens if two users are trying to run independent
SCHED_ISO systems? Both will probably break, right?
And how can you provide _any_ guarantees in an arbitrary environment
without this becoming a privileged operation? I can't quite get my head
around that at the moment...
I guess if you have SCHED_ISO start out with 0 guarantees, and have root
dole some out, then it may be workable. But then that is just another
specialised ad hoc sort of hack wouldn't it? (not talking about
SCHED_ISO itself, but the granting of the privilege to use it).
