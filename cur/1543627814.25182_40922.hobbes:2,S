Not sure I follow here, you're a bit vague about "doing the same thing".
Do you mean syncing from the mainline kernel?  It's easier to sync from
Linus because BK is being used to do it (e.g. because the Linus kernel is
tracked by BK?)?
For the LinuxSH project, we moved from tracking the full kernel tree (via
CVS) to a drop-in tree structure mainly because of the difficulty in
tracking all upstream kernel changes at once.  It wasn't really related to
what CVS did or did not offer.

I never said anything about working in isolation in any of my posts.  A
drop-in tree is only usable when "dropped in" or symlinked on top of a full
kernel tree.  Because it's not a complete tree, it won't build otherwise.
In order to build and test a drop-in tree, you must have the current
mainline kernel version to drop against (whatever kernel version that has
been specified in the drop-in tree).  If something breaks upstream
(which happens more often than not, esp. in architecture ports), then
you'll see it as soon your build fails or when your kernel panics.  It's
impossible to develop a drop-in tree in complete isolation, so I'm not sure
why you thought this was possible?
Say cache handling is modified kernel-wide and it breaks a number of
architecture backends (this is a real world example, somewhere around
2.4.10 or so this actually happened).  Until you work out a fix for say,
the SuperH architecture, you pull in and modify the global cache-handling
files and modify it locally.  Once a proper fix has been developed, you
send your arch-specific cache routines upstream and remove the global
cache-handling files from your drop-in tree.
Also, the size of a drop-in tree is a side effect of its composition, it
was used to illustrate the benefit of the simplicity of drop-in trees - if
you recall the introductory paragraph of my original reply to yours, I said
that drop-in trees are most useful for kernel subsystems and backend
(architecture) ports.  The number of files that are specific to these
projects are a fraction of the size of the full kernel, and because of
this, it gives you a simpler, more readable view of your "corner" of the
kernel.  I don't know why you assumed I was on some fanatical quest to save
disk space.  However, I do mind how much of my broadband bandwidth is used
(since I'm stuck with a flaky ADSL link) and I'm sure developers still on 56K
links also mind.

Cool, finally you give a straight answer to an honest query.  You orignally
asked why I thought BK was inefficient as opposed to CVS, so I assume you
misunderstood my response to James.  I'm operating on the available info I
have on BK, where cloning is an all or nothing operation.  Is this not the
case?  Can you selectively pull in parts of the tree (similiar to drop-in
functionality) and is anyone doing it?  This is why I was opposed to the
linuxconsole drop-in tree moving to BK, not because of "some other agenda"
but because it screws up how I develop and test the tree.  I guess in
retrospect, you really didn't have a valid entrance into the thread, but I
guess any post including "Bitkeeper" catches your eye?
So, splitting trees in BK.  Do you mean by using native BK commands, or by
planning ahead and using multiple repositories?  Perhaps when you've
finished flaming me and defaming CVS you can give me a valid response as to
how one would maintain a drop-in tree using BK.  The isolation argument
doesn't fly since drop-in trees are far from isolated, and the disk space
thing was taken a bit out of context, but that's understandable.
You seem to be stuck on "why CVS sucks" while I'm trying to convey "why CVS
does what I need it to do" as far as drop-in trees are concerned.  From
every other pro-BK anti-everyother-RCS post I've read from you, you seem
conditioned to attack (or belittle) anyone that doesn't accept BK as
gospel.  I understand taking pride in your work, but damn!  Take it easy.
If you really wanted to help me (or convert me) to using BK, you'd just
tell me how the heck to do a drop-in tree, and I'd walk away enlightened.

I was able to ascertain that BK didn't support drop-in trees by just
reading www.bitmover.com.  Was there somewhere else I should've been
instead?
