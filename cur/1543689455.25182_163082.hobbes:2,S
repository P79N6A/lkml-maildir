A problem is that set_virtual_address_space cannot be called multiple times,
and so it interacts badly with kexec.  I was just about to disable it
on the ia64 tree, so I could use kexec.  Besides that BIOS calls
should be quite infrequent so flipping to physical mode this should
not matter.  That plus not being in physical mode looks like a great
way to trip up various implementation bugs when there are multiple
implementations.

Hmm.  You have added additional parameters passed to the kernel, but
have not updated the documentation.  Nor have you bumped the protocol
number in setup.S. 
Beyond that you have duplicated a bunch of variables that already have
perfectly valid ways of being passed to the kernel.
initrd_start, initrd_size, num_cols, num_rows, orig_x, orig_y and the
command line should be passed in their original locations.  At least
baring the creation of a subarch and starting from scratch.  
kernel_start, and kernel_size are not used.
loader_start, and loader_size are not used.
And are probably equally valid in other contexts.
