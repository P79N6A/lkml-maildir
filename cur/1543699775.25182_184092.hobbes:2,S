What version of hot-plug are you using?  Is it compatible with 2.6?
I say this because of the "bogus sysfs" messages in the log and a line
about not being able to load a module, the latter meaning either you
haven't compiled the right module or hot-plug is asking for the wrong one.
Hot-plug is not listed in your software versions.  Verify that your
version supports 2.6.
I dimly remember tripping over something like this when I switched to
2.6.0-test2 many months ago.  I grabbed the latest hotplug RPM.

I'm not an expert on usb-storage, this is just from my experiences.
