> ------------------
> mthca does not restore the following PCI-X/PCI Express registers after reset:
>   PCI-X device: PCI-X command register
>   PCI-X bridge: upstream and downstream split transaction registers
>   PCI Express : PCI Express device control and link control registers
> 
> This causes instability and/or bad performance on systems where one of
> these registers is set to a non-default value by BIOS.

By the way, Greg, this code is completely generic, and the same seems to apply
to all PCI-X/PCI-Express devices - should not pci_restore_state and
friends really know about these registers, as well?
What do you think?
