NR_CPUS is not tooooo bad an approximation.  After all, the output size is
approximately proportional to the number of CPUs.
Multiplied by the number of interrupts :(
           CPU0       CPU1

  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
We could perhaps just convert it to num_online_cpus() and run away.  Depends
how heoric you're feeling.
