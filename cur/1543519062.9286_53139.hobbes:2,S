I don't know which gcc version is shipping with RedHat but I've been using
egcs 1.1.2 (shipping with SuSE 6.1) for a long time now without any
problems, compiling everything for pentium and -O6.
Even compiling kernels with -O6 is not a problem for me.
Using binutils 2.9.5.0.19 at the moment.
Haven't noticed any file corruption so far, have been running 2.3.30
non-stop for about 3.5 days doing a lot of compiles on a machine with tight
memory (32Mb).
Kernel configured for i586TSC, UP.
