Yeah, but that's because voluntary preempt is somewhat of a hack.
In fact, we recently decided to turn this off in SLES11 because it
was causing a measurable performance slowdown.
If you are actually debugging a page lock problem or writing new
code, you would be very very happy to have a problem caught here
rather than the potentially much harder task of causing a
schedule on this lock.

I don't really know the code, but if it gives extra help to
people writing or testing new devices... is it difficult to
carry around? If not, then why *not* have it upstream? ;)

Maybe I'll go through and add some such assertions for fs developers.
fsblock is riddled with them and it really really helps catching weird
and wonderful problems in the buffer layer, the pagecache layer, or
the filesystem, or some combination of them ;) Maybe that's just
because I write a lot of bugs though!

OK.
