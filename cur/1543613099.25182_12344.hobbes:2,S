Hi John,
What is this system? A desktop? What is the motherboard?
Please send me the output from:
- dmesg
- /proc/interrupts
- /proc/ioports
- /proc/iomem
- the output from /proc/acpi/dsdt (if possible) or get pmtools from
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
 and please
provide the output from acpidmp.
Thanks -- Regards -- Andy
PS you may also want to try the latest ACPI patch from that same site, but
my guess is it will not solve your problem.
