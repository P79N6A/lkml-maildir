I bet you're using a recent cdrecord and growisofs, both of which have
had Linux-specific code added to use the non-SCSI interface. Programs
which are written for SCSI won't run on that interface.
I'm told that SCSI programs for Win9x will run under vmware using
ide-scsi under 2.4 but not 2.6, can someone confirm? I don't have the
software for that test, but I'm told Win9x is quite popular ;-)
The last time I tried cdparanoia it didn't work with 2.6 (ATAPI or
ide-scsi), and I haven't tried cdda2wav. Some work, some don't.
Please let us know if you're using other software than my guess, hard to
track what's been converted from SCSI to ATAPI.
