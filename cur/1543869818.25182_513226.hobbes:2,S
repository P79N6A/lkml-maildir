The system could be UP .. I don't think tracking this kind of thing is
trival, and given the TSC track record you have to assume there are will
be other issue in the future.

The NTP daemon needs to be active AFAIK before you would start observing
weird time jumps. There are adjustments made without NTP but they are
only seen over short periods.. So I still think gettimeofday() would be
an alternative ..
Have you considered adding something to glibc? You could access only the
TSC from userspace.. I don't think the addition of a vsyscall/syscall
for this would go over too well considering that there are other ways to
get timestamps. It might help if you tell us what you think this would
be used for in userspace ?
