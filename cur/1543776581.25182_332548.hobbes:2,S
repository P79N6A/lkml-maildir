there's one more pretty efficient debugging method:
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_print_at_crash
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_freerunning
and then upon oopses the kernel will print a full execution trace that 
led up to the crash. But this definitely needs a serial console to be 
usable, as the kernel will print out thousands of trace entries.
(also, since it seems your kernel crashes when trying to print out the 
stacktrace, you'd also have to move the print_traces(task) line within 
arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:show_trace() to the beginning of that 
function.)
