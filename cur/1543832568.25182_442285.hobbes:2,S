I don't want to go this way immediately, but if we did, it doesn't need to 
mean breakage for userland. Suspend2 could replace the tunables that swsusp 
uses, so it could be a transparent replacement for swsusp, assuming that the 
filewriter was turned off by default. (I say this because if the filewriter 
and swapwriter are both compiled in, the format for resume2 is
resume2=[swap|file]:/dev/<whatever><:offset>
But with only the swapwriter or only the filewriter, the "swap" or "file" is 
optional.

Nigel
