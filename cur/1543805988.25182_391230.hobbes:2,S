Hi,
for some strange reason, `quota -v` showed an impossible number in the 
inodes (files) field, something that resembled 2^64 - n, n={1..100}. I do 
not know how it happened, but I wanted to reinitialize the quota. Though, 
how does one do that with XFS? (Since it's different from the vfsv0 quota 
architecture.)
By chance, I could make xfs reinit it using:
  quotaoff /D
  touch /D/something
  umount /D
  mount /D   # impliclty mounts with usrquota,grpquota (options in fstab)
but it would have been nicer to have a mount option.
