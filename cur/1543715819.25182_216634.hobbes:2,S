may be you're sleeping for 120 instead of 120*HZ, which
means you're really sleeping 1.2s on x86.

iptable_mangle.c comment reads 'root is playing with
raw sockets' above this message. It means that you're
sending too short IP packets (len < 20 bytes) or packets
with the IHL field < 5. It's just a harmless message.
