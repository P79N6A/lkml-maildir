Subject: Unable to format a partition after swapoff

Hello,
I am using dual boot configuration Win95/linux with a shared swap file.
After doing swapoff /dev/hda5 I try to format the partition. However, I 
am unable to do it because of some I/O errors. I cannot format it even 
after doing several syncs and waiting a few minutes. When I 
boot without enabling swap the partition can be formatted normally. 
Kernel 2.2.14.
Has anyone encountered this problem ? In 2.2.1 it worked.
