Having the 386 non SMP only means you dont have to worry about this. We dont
currently support an SMP kernel that boots reliably on all non SMP boxes.
At least not officially although current 2.4 seems close.

They would still be needed. The 686 built glibc materially improves performance
on 686 class machines. That one isnt an interesting problem to solve. Install
the right software instead.
