I just built gcc on 2.4.19-rc3 + latest JFS and didn't have a problem.  
I'll repeat it on 2.4.19-rc2-ac2, but there shouldn't be more than a 
comsmetic difference in the JFS code.  I haven't tried 2.5.27 yet.

It looks like tlck->mp was null in txUpdateMap, and hold_metapage was 
called with the null pointer.  I haven't seen this before, but I am 
looking at the code to see if I can figure out how it may have 
happened.  I'm guessing that you have built the kernel without 
CONFIG_JFS_DEBUG set.  If I'm right, can you set this before you try to 
stress JFS again.  It may help find the problem earlier.
