Which only means that "more" should have inheritable set equal to
zero. I _still_ do not see why setting inheritable set should be
privileged operation. Secure programs should not execute external
applications of normal users. [Do you aim at /usr/ucb/Mail being
safelly able to execute user-supplied programs? That would be
NICE... but can you make it unix?]
Ok, given example with "more"... I do not think inheritable set of
"more" set to NULL would help: even if it was that way, shell executed
from more would have uid == 0 and no privileges. But what user owns
/etc/passwd? uid == 0. And I've got a shell with... uid == 0. So I do
not need any privilege (it is owned by same uid!) to edit /etc/passwd
and you are screwed; anyway. I could this be solved in "pure
capabilities" system, but I do not see how you want to fit protection
against "more" attack and still be unix.
