strange - i can do such things (and other things) with the vanilla 
scheduler (except vmware which i dont run). It would be nice to debug 
your 'cannot play midi' problem for example - could you try to describe 
it a bit more accurately so that we can try to reproduce it and fix it? 
(in the alternative i can send you tracing patches to capture what the 
scheduler does and how)
also, could you possibly try these workloads you described with Mike's 
latest patch too? Thanks,
	Ingo
