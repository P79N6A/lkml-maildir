Some part of your resource isn't mapped through the cardbus bridge. Either
because the bridge resources themselves were wrong, or because we didn't
enable the resouce after we allocated it (the latter is unlikely, as any
"pci_enable_dev()" will do that part).

This is the problem.
The PCI code thinks that the parent of the network device doesn't have
resources allocated, so it will allocate the resources from the parent of
the parent.
Which is wrong, since it means that it will try to allocate the PCI
resources from outside the window that the cardbus controller is
exporting. Resulting in the fffff stuff.
HOWEVER, I don't see why that happens. yenta_allocate_resources() should
have made absolutely certain that we have all the necessary bridge
resources clearly allocated. Can you add debug code to the end of
"yenta_allocate_res()" that prints out the resource that got allocated?
Pat?
