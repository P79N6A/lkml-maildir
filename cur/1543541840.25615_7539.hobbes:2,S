   I noticed this problem as well; it seems to have vanished after an
   # echo 0 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
This should have no effect on the system unless CONFIG_INET_ECN is
turned on in your .config, and it is off by default, so I just want to
clarify that people seeing this problem are turning CONFIG_INET_ECN on
in their configs.
