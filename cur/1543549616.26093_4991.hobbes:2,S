Hello,
	Kind of off-topic question. 
	I want to reset/set keyboard from my own interrupt handler
	(via irq 9), so I don't want/can't to use bios (or even dos)
	interface. This assumes a PC.
	Looking at kernel sources it seems to me, that reset of 
	keyboard would be 
             outp(0x60,0xFF);
	and if I would want to set CAPS_LOCK led, it would be something
	like this
             outp(0x60,0xED);
             sleep(1);
             outp(0x60,0x2);
	Yet it does not work. Can anyone hint me in right direction
	what I'm doing wrong? A 5 line example would be great. 
	I suspect it has something to do w/ timing, but not sure
	where the error is.
	The above example is from borland 4.5 for dos (under dosemu).
	(so it is emulated keyboard contoller, but it should not
	make differnce).
