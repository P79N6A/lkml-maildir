Running kernel 2.2.14 with NR_TASKS set to 1024, dual PPro 200s, libc
5.4.38, binutils-2.9.1.0.15, gcc version 2.7.2.1, procps version 1.2.7
On trying to start a new apache 1.3.9/ssl-1.3.7 web process I get:
[Tue Mar  7 15:03:13 2000] [emerg] (28)No space left on device: could not
call shmget

I really dont get the MemShared line.
If i shut one down and then try running it for this domain, it'll work,
but then the previous one outptus the same error.
Any help is appreciated
