Feel free to remove this one. It was never in a state that worked, but
was added to the tree anyway. I tried to fix it when I was given a
copy of the documentation, but it needed more work than I initially
expected. The initial version that was in the tree could only detect
the drives, and the only thing I added other than some bug fixes was
support for the eject ioctl. The read/write path in the driver is
missing the actual data transfer routines, and is therefore not in
a working state.
For the record, I believe the linux-mac68k list is dead.
