That's true.  The patch does fix i386 without any bad side-effects.  A
generic fix that would fix all architectures would be a little more
complicated, since the size of st_blocks varies.  32-bit big-endian
would have to explicitly copy the high and low words.  (The first time I
looked at this, I ignored the fact that the change was in asm-i386.)
