Hi Andy
sorry, almost mistake maked by me.

yes, your code is more better.
Thanks.

Yes.
this patch series assume LRU_BASE == LRU_INACTIVE.

if add LRU_FILE, this statement makes messy.
key point of indexed arraynize is able to arithmetic calculationed.

I think your code is more descriptive, but not best simply.
I think LRU_BASE == LRU_INACTIVE assumption make simply code.

agghh
thank you good catch ;)
Thank you again for your very careful reviews.
