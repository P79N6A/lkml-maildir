You mean some sort of proxy/two-tier development? A "commit/rollback"
transaction model on the kernel itself?
I deeply agree with you, especially in keeping "many eyes" to look at the
same kernel tree, and not chosing one of the many subtrees; as added bonus,
this stuff is buzzword compliant! What we can ask more? :)
Now, Linus' call to accept _your_ patch. Fingers crossed already.
