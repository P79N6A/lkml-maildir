Hi Kernel mailing list!
IIRC: if I recall correctly 
we couldn't compile ACPI without Power management option (CONFIG_PM),
but now, this is possible.
If the answer to the subject is no, then consider apply this patch on
kernel 2.4.26.
Accidentally, I compile ACPI without CONFIG_PM on one Dell something
dual Pentium III and power off didn't work.
So I need some confirmation from acpi-devel, but this is one meter of
xconfig of the kernel so ...
For APM Xconfiguration, it's better that, we can choose APM options only
if we select APM ( because if we don't select CONFIG_PM, CONFIG_APM will
be disable and the APM options don't!).
This patch correct also this situation.
Thanks,
