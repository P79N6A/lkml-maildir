In addition to what Andi said, the infrastructural changes are so that you can do
more than just printk()ing information, namely enter a debugger. Even for printk()
I doubt someone has verified and can guarantee for the future that the possible
code paths never use any of the things that make assumptions about the current
stack (specifically, uses of thread_info).

Will change that.

Here, the code could probably be enabled always, but I dislike having dead code like
this needlessly compiled.

We could, when not considering broader use. I specifically introduced N_EXCEPTION_TSS
so that it wouldn't be as hard as it currently is to have other exceptions got through task
gates (nlkd's fault/trap/abort infrastructure does, for example).

8k TSS plus 4k stack per CPU compared to a single global TSS plus 1k stack in current code. One could argue that the
I/O bitmap isn't really needed here, but mis-using it as stack wouldn't work well (because of the thread_info
restrictions the TSS would then need to be allocated so that the I/O bitmap gets page aligned), nor can it be easily
left off (struct tss_struct unfortunately includes this non-architectural part).

Fine with me; just followed the x86-64 naming.
