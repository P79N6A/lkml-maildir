Actually, after reading that code I suspect that get_fs_excl() in there
is the wrong thing to do.  Why?  Because the logics is all wrong.
Look what we do under lock_super().  There are two things: ->remount_fs()
and ->write_super().  Plus whatever low-level filesystems are using
lock_super() for.
I would argue that we want to move get_fs_excl() down to the places in
->write_super() that actually want to do something deserving it.  And
to be honest, I'm not at all sure that lock_super() should survive
at upper layers, but that's a longer story...
