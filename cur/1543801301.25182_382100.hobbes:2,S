This blatant attempt to defend a broken subsystem by "analogy" fails  
because last time
I checked the semantics of system calls like read/write/open/close  
didn't
change significantly between kernel version 1.0 and 2.6.15.
The number of system calls didn't change that much as well.
Yes it may be true that some aggregation of exhaustive crappy  
interfaces over time
in the kernel can be indeed observed. However the very fact which  
makes it remain
still usable are precisely those very "primitive" system calls -  
which are still
around and kicking.
