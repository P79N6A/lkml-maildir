Uh, there is nothing that says mutex_unlock or any unlock
functions contain an implicit smp_mb(). What is given is that the
lock and unlock obey aquire and release memory ordering,
respectively.
a = x;
xxx_unlock
b = y;
In this situation, the load of y can be executed before that of x.
And some architectures will even do so (i386 can, because the
unlock is an unprefixed store; ia64 can, because it uses a release
barrier in the unlock).
Whenever you rely on orderings of things *outside* locks (even
partially outside), you do need to be very careful about barriers
and can't rely on locks to do the right thing for you.

It *may* be the case that these can be removed, but not by virtue
of the fact that the smp_mb is redundant.
