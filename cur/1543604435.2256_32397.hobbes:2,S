linux 2.4.11 is broken with respect to tulip driver and dec 21041
chipset.  my 21041 card doesn't work either.  what you can do is the
following.  compile kernel using a module for tulip driver.  go to
tulip.sourceforge.net.  get tulip-0.9.14.  unpack it.  for each new
kernel, manually (or make a script) compile a tulip driver in
tulip-0.9.14 and install it in
/lib/module/2.4.X/kernel/drivers/net/tulip.  this will replace the
broken driver and keep you going.
