Sorry, that was my fault.  I dropped the GC code inside the locks
without thinking.
In fact, the GC list linking doesn't need to sit inside the locks
at all.  The locks are there to guard the setting of policy->dead
only.
So here is a patch to simplify xfrm_policy_kill() by moving the
GC linking after the write_unlock_bh().
Actually, as the code stands, xfrm_policy_kill() should/will never
be called twice on the same policy.  So we can add a warning to
catch that.
