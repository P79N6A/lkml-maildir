you need a system equipped with an IO-APIC (either SMP system, or UP
system with IOAPIC). Then any IRQ source (or more) can be marked to be
delivered to the NMI pin - sorting out which IRQ is which is a different
matter. If only one IRQ is redirected to NMI then it's not a problem. A
redirected IRQ is dedicated to be NMI, so it will not show up in the
do_IRQ() path.
so it's a special case, and for the 'generic ISA box' case it's not
possible without extra hardware. (but the extra hardware to generate
periodic NMI interrupts is not expensive at all)
