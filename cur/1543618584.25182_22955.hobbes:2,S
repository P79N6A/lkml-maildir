I've got a Dell Inspiron 3500 where the sound works fine on the first boot 
but the IRQ gets lost after an APM suspend, and even unloading/reloading the 
module doesn't help.  (The I/O addresses are still valid, but it gets no IRQ. 
 KDE has no sound, from the command line it loops playing the same segment 
over and over complaining about timeouts...)
It's been doing this for a year.  I've mentioned it here a few times before.  
I've played around with setpci and such, but haven't been able to fix it.  I 
just reboot when I want sound.  The bios sets it up right (on a cold boot, 
not returning from APM).  Linux (even 2.4.17) does not.
