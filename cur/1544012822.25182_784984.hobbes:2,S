Hi, Randy & James,
The cxgb3i driver was using the skb->sp for some internal stuff. I have just submitted a patch to remove the usage of it since it is not really related to the secure path.
The patch is submitted to the list (
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=123061555414193&w=2
) and is also attached here.
Sorry for the late response, I am traveling this week.
Thanks,
Karen

That's correct.  config file is now attached.

[PATCH 1/1] cxgb3i - remove use of skb->sp
From: Karen Xie <kxie@chelsio.com>
The cxgb3i was using skb->sp pointer for some internal book-keeping which is not related to the secure path. Changed it to use skb->cb[] instead.
