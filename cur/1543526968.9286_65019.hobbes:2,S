	The dependencies are there for a reason; you override them at your
own risk.  If two packages depend on each other, simply upgrade them both
in the same rpm command, ala:
rpm -Uvh goober-1.2-1.i386.rpm goober-devel-1.2-1.i386.rpm
	Use --nodeps only when you're _sure_ that the dependencies have
been satisfied in a way that rpm doesn't know about (i.e. you installed
the correct version by hand).  
	RedHat's 6.2 beta and rawhide directories may have versions of
those programs that are not yet in a released distribution; contrib is a
good third choice of places to look.

	You have two choices.  Either read the kernel-HOWTO at
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/
 and follow the steps listed there, or do it
the easy way (as root):
rpm -Uvh 
ftp://slartibartfast.pa.net/pub/buildkernel/buildkernel-1.00-1.noarch.rpm<Enter>
buildkernel 2.3.47 --BKBUILDTYPE=bzImage<Enter>
	and follow the prompts.  More documentation on the program is in
/usr/doc/buildkernel-1.00/...
	Cheers,
	- Bill
