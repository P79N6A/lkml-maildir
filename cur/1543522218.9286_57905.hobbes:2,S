I wouldn't be so quick to assume it isn't cabling.  We found that
exceeding 20MB/s with (high quality) external cables on single-ended
DPT controllers led to infrequent SCSI errors.  Under heavy loads,
command queuing greatly magnified the damage, apparently affecting inodes
the most.

The inode damage eventually produced errors very much like this.
