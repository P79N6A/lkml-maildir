I still has that bug with 2.4.18-pre7, and it has this patch applied.
stack traces are:
p1:
        schedule()
        devfs_de_revalidate_wait()
        cached_lookup()
        lookup_hash()
        sys_unlink()
        system_call()
p2:
        schedule()
        wait_for_devfsd_finished()
        devfs_lookup(()
        lookup_hash()
        unix_bind()
        sys_bind()
        sys_socketcall()
        system_call()
the thing that they are tring to create/remove is /dev/log.
And devfsd is already running in that state:
    __schedule()
    __down()
    __down_failed()
    __text_lock_namei()
This has worked normally until now, it has beggining to fail yesterday.
Later, Juan.
