Of course automatically generated message numbers would be great and
something like:
hub.4a5bcd77: Detected some problem.
looks acceptable for me.
We could generate the hash using the format string of the printk. Since
we specify the format string also in KMSG_DOC, the hash for the
KMSG_DOC and the printk should match and we have the required link
between printk and description.
So technically that's probably doable.
Problems are:
* hashes are not unique
* We need an additional preprocessor step
* The might be people, who find 8 character hash values ugly in printks
The big advantage is, that we do not need to maintain message numbers.

Since in our approach the message catalog is created automatically for
exactly one kernel and the message catalog belongs therefore to exactly
one kernel, I think the problem of changing error numbers is not too
big.
