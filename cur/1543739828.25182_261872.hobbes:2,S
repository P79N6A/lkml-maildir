No, all other machines don't have firmware support for drawing text. That 
is why we wrote this code in the first place.

U-Boot and OpenBIOS on the machines we are working with do not have any 
support for initialising the video card. Both could be modified but at 
present neither support this so the only way to bring up the video card 
for framebuffer console support is in the kernel.
