So if you can't handle the IPI when you get it, set a flag and trap on the
next sti.  It certainly sounds like broken hardware to me and it can be
worked around, can't it ?
Maybe we should have a version of smp_call_function that uses softirqs
(unless those are broken on sparc as well ;) ) and use the old version for
the very performance-sensitive parts only ?
Putting all tests for smp_call_function in the timer interrupt code doesn't
make any sense at all to me.
