Answer 1: in 2.4.2 the loop device does not work
 (but things are better in the -ac patches).
Answer 2: the kernel tends to believe filesystem data,
 and a corrupted filesystem can seriously confuse the kernel.
If you make sure that the problem does not lie in loop
(you can mount other images without problems), then
I wouldnt mind seeing your image (or rather, the first
MB or two of it) to see whether the isofs code must be
improved. (In that case, put some smallish fragment up for ftp
and mail the URL to aeb@cwi.nl. Don't mail cd images.)
