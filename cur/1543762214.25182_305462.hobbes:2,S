It's numa (two cores, one ram ctrlr per core, one core per package). I'm
running an x86 kernel, btw, not 64bit. I have CONFIG_X86_HT set, and it
looks like it gets the pkg id from the apic (there's only one in multicore
packages?), but i might be reading it wrong.
My dmseg overflows before syslog starts, so all i could gather is: 
Mar 23 12:04:25 zero kernel: Brought up 2 CPUs
Mar 23 12:04:25 zero kernel: CPU0 attaching sched-domain:
Mar 23 12:04:25 zero kernel:  domain 0: span 3
Mar 23 12:04:25 zero kernel:   groups: 1 2
Mar 23 12:04:25 zero kernel: CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
Mar 23 12:04:25 zero kernel:  domain 0: span 3
Mar 23 12:04:25 zero kernel:   groups: 2 1
I don't know how the scheduling domains work, and i'm too busy to look it up
right now.
