I don't like ASSERT_RTNL() much because it actually tries to lock it.
I'd be much happer if it was WARN_ON(!mutex_locked(&rtnl_mutex)) or
something equivalent.
In any case, I have an updated patch I'll be sending soon, and it
requires a new list walking primitive I'll also send.

Yes, not all walkers of the list are protected by the RTNL.
