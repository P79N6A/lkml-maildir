my experiance is taht if you don't have CONFIG_LBD enabled then the kernel 
will report the larger disk as 2G and everything will work, you just won't 
get all the space.
plus he seems to be crashing around 500G of data
and finally (if I am reading the post correctly) if he configures the 
drives as 4x2.2TB=11TB instead of 2x5.5TB=11TB he doesn't have the same 
problem.
I'm getting ready to setup a similar machine that will have 3x10TB (3 15 
disk arrays with 750G drives), but won't be ready to try this for a few 
more days.
