(s/machine/CPU/)
hm, I guess it adds a theoretical deadlock if some other CPU is in the
middle of printk and is trying to take some_lock and this CPU takes an oops
while holding some_lock.  Probably that's an acceptable tradeoff though.

Does this guy really need to be volatile?  Coud we use atomic_t and lose
that wmb()?

Methinks this should be raw_smp_processor_id().
