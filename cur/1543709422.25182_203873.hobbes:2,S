Using 2.6.3, if I try to use dvdrecord (dvdrtools v0.1.4) to record to
a firewire dvd burner, the entire system locks up. (To the extend that
alt-sysrq doesn't work)
I can sucessfully burn a dvd onto the same drive using growisofs,
which uses the cdrom driver (sr_mod) instead of the scsi generic
driver (sg) used by dvdrecord.
I tried updating to the latest ieee1394 code (as of this morning, from
linuxieee1394.org) which did not seem to help.
With 2.6.1, I had problems with sbp2 and hostap_plx, which are sharing
the same interrupt.  (I got it to work by updating to 2.6.3) This may
be related.
System is a dual athlon, if that makes any difference.
Can anyone else duplicate this problem?
