Subject: Problems after building a 2.2.14 Kernel

I had the following problems after re-configuring/re-building
my kernel at the 2.2.14 level. 
 1. I did a "make modules_install" and yet the modules.dep file is not found. 
Feb  4 19:09:58 localhost depmod: depmod: Can't open /lib/modules/2.2.14/modules.dep
Feb  4 19:09:58 localhost rc.sysinit: Finding module dependencies failed
Feb  4 19:09:58 localhost modprobe: modprobe: Can't open dependencies file /lib/modules/2.2.14/modules.dep (No such file or directory) 
Feb  4 19:09:58 localhost rc.sysinit: Loading sound module failed
Feb  4 19:09:58 localhost modprobe: modprobe: Can't open dependencies file /lib/modules/2.2.14/modules.dep (No such file or directory) 
   Yet, IMHO it is accessible 
[root@acee-aptiva 2.2.14]# ls -l /lib/modules/2.2.14/modules.dep
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root          542 Feb  4 19:28 /lib/modules/2.2.14/modules.dep
 2. I can't seem to open a shell (even though this works fine on 2.2.5-15 (Redhat 6.0 base)). 
Feb  5 00:10:09 localhost gdm[461]: gdm_auth_secure_display: Could not unlink /var/gdm/:0.xauth file: No such file or directory
Feb  5 00:10:23 localhost PAM_pwdb[468]: (gdm) session opened for user root by (uid=0)
Feb  5 00:11:04 localhost PAM_pwdb[468]: (gdm) session closed for user root
Feb  5 00:11:21 localhost PAM_pwdb[541]: (gdm) session opened for user root by (uid=0)
Due to #2, I have reverted to 2.2.5-15. I'd be happy to send my .config to anyone
who has the time to look at it. 
Thanks,
