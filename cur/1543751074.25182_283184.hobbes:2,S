Everything I've looked at so far has been for single-processor systems 
AFAICT - embedded processors, evaluation boards, etc.  I do not pretend 
to have intimate familiarity with the hardware in question, and I will 
be much more careful when I reach anything that can be plugged into an 
SMP box, but I was grabbing the low-hanging fruit first.  The nasty 
stuff (drivers/char, for example) will come later.
That's why I cc'd the arch maintainers - figured they'd whack me with a 
cluebat if I'd overlooked something.
