I'm not sure I see what your exactly livelock scenario is...

My point is we do the looping in the fault handler if the PTE is still
absent and there is no signal pending and we return to userspace (and
drop the mmap_sem) if any of these criterias is met. We might want to
add a cond_resched() in the first case too.
Wouldn't that solve the livelock issue ?
Ben.
