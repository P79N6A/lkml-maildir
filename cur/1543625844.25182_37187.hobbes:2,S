The problem you face is that the kernel needs to know where foo is to
generate a the bytecode that calls it.  Here is a better scenario...
You expose an interface in the kernel such as
	typedef void (*func_t)(int);
	void register_func ( func_t func );
	EXPORT_SYMBOL (register_func);
Then in your modules you call 'register_func' and that will pass the
function in question to the kernel.  The kernel can then do whatever it
wants to that pointer (like call it).
