Quick notice to developers. Prism54 1.2 is out, cvs was tagged with
rel-1-2. The 2.6.7-bk3 and 2.6.7-mm1 have prism54 1.2. I just submitted
prism54 1.2 to Andrew for the 2.4 stock kernel.
Patches and development improvements are now welcomed but from now 
on please submit any changes/patches for verification first
with netdev. If accepted then apply to CVS. We're no longer a cheap'ol
driver, our changes need to be reviewed by the good guys now ;) 
If you're not subscribed to netdev and you are a prism54 developer, 
please do so as prism54 development discussion should take place there now.
We'll still use prism54 devel for archiving purposes (CC's to netdev).
I've put some notes on the prism54.org page, if I forgot
something/someone I'm sorry, please e-mail me. I'll go ahead now and 
null out the ChangeLog so we can start 1.3 work. 
	Luis
