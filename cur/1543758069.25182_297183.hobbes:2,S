hmm, well, but the ioctls are somewhat mixed, i.e.
some of them do just read (only) like operations,
others do change stuff, and the test is just valid
for write/change ioctls ...
of course I could add a second switch/case block
which checks for 'write' type ioctls and blocks
them in the beginning ... 
but maybe I did misunderstood your comment, so let
me know what you consider appropriate ...

actually I started the BME patches by extending the
IS_RDONLY() macro to take two arguments, the inode 
and the vfsmount (which sounded natural to me) but
that was shot down ... (don't remember why exactly)
no problem with a file_readonly() or nd_readonly()
if that makes folks happy ...
thanks,
