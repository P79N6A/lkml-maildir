The way you can avoid reboot is to leave the interrupt turned off at
the PIC. The side effect is that everything else using that interrupt
is also turned off.
I did experiment with catching the process exit from the user space
app on abort. Then I used the power control registers to turn off the
card if it supported being turned off. That would then safely let me
reenable the pick.
This code needs to refuse to attach to a shared IRQ until problems
with them are fixed. Most IRQs are shared on x86 desktops. Every
machine I have around here has no free IRQ's available.
