I tested several more times under 2.6.22-rc4, there's  no such problem.
The hci_dev_put is indeed a bug, isn't it? it decrement the refcout on
more time like you said.
But why the slub doesn't warning under 2.6.22-rc4 but do under
2.6.22-rc3-mm1? I'm puzzled.
And if this is a bug , should I write another post to list?  then to
mm or mainline?
I'm still new to kernel list,  thanks you all.
Regards
dave
