Offer an alternative?  :)  Linked list costs us as much or MORE for 
->next as the gid_t.  kmalloc() doesn't work for previous reasoning.  I 
considered a list of gid arr[256] or similar.  A voice reminds me that 
it doesn't impact us noticably in real use.  Now, maybe other 
architectures will find a good reason to switch to kmalloc() list of 
smaller arrays, and the associated complextities or something else more 
clever.
