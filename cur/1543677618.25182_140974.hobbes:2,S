Hi,
I have a K7 mainboard with VT8366 chipset, but I can't
turn IDE DMA on:
atlantis# hdparm -d1 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
Writing to /proc/ide/ide0/hda/settings has no effect.
Can anyone give me a hint how to turn DMA on?
regards
Hadmut
