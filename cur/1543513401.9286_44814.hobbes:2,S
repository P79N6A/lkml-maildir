The kernel only has access to symbols which base kernel chose to export
(kernel/ksyms.c and arch/i386/kernel/i386_ksyms.c). However, you are not
blind and neither was I - just slightly short-sighted :)
I forgot about the well-known fact that sys_call_table[] is exported so
modules should call sys_XXX() functions indirectly via sys_call_table[].
I even wrote a little module ages ago that is based solely on this simple
fact.

Tigran.
