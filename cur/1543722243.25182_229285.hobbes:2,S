In the recent past, there has been released many new types of both disk 
and cpu schedulers, i wonder wich of them i should use to get best
performance on my desktop system?
Nickshed v30g, or maybe staircase 7.1, or spa, hudra, hybrid and so on,
those are all quite new IO schedulers.
Also there has been som new releases of the CFQ cpu scheduler, and som
addons to this, cfq-ionice and so on.
What scheduler combination do you use?
