   I see your point, please try with 2.4.21rc4aa1 or with this patch:
   	
http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.21rc4aa1/00_ksoftirqd-max-loop-networking-1
   you can put a printk in the ksoftirqd loop and tune the N until it
   behaves as you want.
Ingo's specweb testing indicated that a value somewhere between 8 and
10 appear optimal.
I've pushed this change into Andrew's -mm 2.5.x patch set.
