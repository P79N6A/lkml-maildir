The READ6 and WRITE6 commands are deprecated. The READ6 is still specified
as mandatory for block devices for compatibility with old initialisation
code. WRITE6 is specified as optionnal for block devices.

IMO, the speed improvement, if it exist, should be not more than a single
micro-second with modern hardware, and, as you know, it can only apply
to the first 2GB for 512 bytes sectors. This makes it irrelevant for
modern systems for both these reasons.

Gérard.
PS: The READ_6/WRITE_6 problem was, in fact, a known problem. :-)
By the way, you may want to provide the complete patch that eradicates 
explicit READ6/WRITE6 commands from the kernel in one step.
