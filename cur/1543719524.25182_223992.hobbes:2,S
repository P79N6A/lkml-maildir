How much precision do you need for you hardware device? It would
probably be easier to use 1 to 2 precision point old integer approx
equations for what you are wanting. However, it is probably the worst
thing to do by putting that much overhead into kernel space. In the end,
if you are needing tight control anyway, a real time kernel would be a 
better match for your requirements. Keep the hardware as simple as 
possible (or put the calculations into the sub-hardware piece).
