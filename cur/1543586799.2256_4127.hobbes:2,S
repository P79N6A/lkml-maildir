Imagine a macro of several lines of code like:
#define FOO(x) \
	printf("arg is %s\n", x); \
	do_something_useful(x);
Now imagine using it like:
	if (blah == 2)
		FOO(blah);
This interprets to
	if (blah == 2)
		printf("arg is %s\n", blah);
		do_something_useful(blah);;
As you can see, the "if" then only encompasses the printf, and the
do_something_useful() call is unconditional (not within the scope of the
if), like you wanted it.
So, by using a block like do{...}while(0), you would get this:
	if (blah == 2)
		do {
			printf("arg is %s\n", blah);
			do_something_useful(blah);
		} while (0);
Which is exactly what you want.
