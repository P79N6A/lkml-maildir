download the source for x86info sometime, and look at the hoops
it jumps through to determine what cpu its running on. It isn't
just as simple as a few cpuid calls any more. These days there are
typically up to a half dozen factors that you need to look at to
discriminate between possibilities. One of these, is cpu speed.
Unfortunatly, as we could have booted off mains, and hence a lower
clock speed, we can't do any runtime calculation like we do with
bogomips/jiffies, so we have to resort to looking at the model name
supplied by the BIOS.

It's pretty much all we have that we can trust.  If we could
do something else, I'd love to, as I distrust the abilities of
BIOS programmers as much as anyone else.
