This distinction is probably quite important.  
The first assertion is that this is an injective mapping from the
domain of files to the range of st_Ito/st_dev pairs.
The second assertion is that this is an injective mapping from the
domain of st_Ito/st_dev pairs to the range of files.
The first may be true even when the second is false.
I'm no expert on SUS, but if a spec says "X uniquely identifies Y"
it's almost certainly asserting that there's an injective mapping from
the domain of X into the domain of Y, and it's probably also
reasonable to infer that the mapping in the other direction is also
injective.

In the absense of a specified duration for which the property must
hold, it's unfortunately necessary (albeit, somewhat dangerous) to
*infer* the duration based on the intended *use* of the property
(e.g. equality testing).  Two parties which intend to employ the
property for different purposes may infer two different durations - a
typical spec deficiency.

It seems this example only presents a challenge to ensuring the
*inferred* requirement of the injective mapping from files to pairs,
not for ensuring *only* the explicit requirement that pairs uniquely
identify a file (but not necessarily that they uniquely identify *one*
file).
