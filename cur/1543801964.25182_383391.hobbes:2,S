Once.  U->K or K->U is not task switching and accordingly has a very
low cost.  It's changing of userspace task that is costly.  And dmix
_is_ a task switch, there is no performance difference between talking
with it through shared memory and semaphores and who knows what else
and talking with it through a kernel interface.
You should count how many U-U switches and U-K syscalls communicating
with dmix represents.  Hard to do for a simple user, since the
protocol is not documented.
  OG.
