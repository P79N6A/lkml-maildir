I either missed that or did not understand it.  I am now rereading your
message....
Is that what you were referring to when you said
	only try to use policy routing hacks (not tested). e.g. tag all outgoing 
	packets with a specific fwmark that redirects them to a specific routing
	table which does the real routing, and put no routes into the normal 
	one used by arpfilter so that it doesnt' reply.
I am not familiar with policy routing.  Could you point me to some
docs I could read or maybe even give a trivial example to start me
on the right path?

Well that at least makes sense as to why it's not in there.
Thank you for all of your help.
