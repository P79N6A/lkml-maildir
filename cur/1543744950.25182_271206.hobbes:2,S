I thought about this, but this will lead to a very intrusive patch.
We have to change the meaning of vm_start and vm_end or increase
the size of vm_area_struct.

Why can't we have only 2 types of prio_tree. One VMA_PRIO_TREE and
another GENERIC_PRIO_TREE.
        struct generic_prio_tree_node {
		unsigned long r_index, h_index;
		struct prio_tree_node prio_tree_node;
	}
That way all new users of prio_tree code will use the
generic_prio_tree_node if possible. Moreover, we can avoid
an intrusive patch.
I am only worried about the micro-performance loss due to
get_index in the hot-paths such as vma_prio_tree_insert.
