8) Or 'NFS: truncated packet in readdir reply!', since that is what
NFS actually is returned by the RPC layer.
When we are sure that the code is stable, the whole message can go. It
is really just reporting a server error. As long as we handle it
correctly, there should be no need to churn out all these printks.
