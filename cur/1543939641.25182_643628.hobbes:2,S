I think there are two things here:
1) Currently we allow modules with no kallsyms info to be loaded into a 
KALLSYMS kernel (and taint).  A new option is needed to control this: 
CONFIG_ACCEPT_NO_KALLSYMS under KERNEL_DEBUG which allows loading of 
such "stripped" modules (a-la modprobe --force).
2) Unconditionally reject modules with a wrong module section size.  Currently 
we have no such check, which means without KALLSYMS, anything goes.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
