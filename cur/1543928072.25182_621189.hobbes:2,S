ooh awesome, i hadn't measured that before.
on a 2 node sockF / revF with a random pointer chase running on cpu 0 / 
node 0 i see the avg load-to-load cache miss latency jump from 77ns to 
109ns when i add an unaligned lock-intensive workload on one core of node 
1.  the worst i can get the pointer chase latency to is 273ns when i add 
two threads on node 1 fighting over an unaligned lock.
on a 4 node (square) the worst case i can get seems to be an increase from 
98ns with no antagonist to 385ns with 6 antagonists fighting over an 
unaligned lock on the other 3 nodes.
cool.
