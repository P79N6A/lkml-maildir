So as I argued in a previous email, non-native English speakers tend to
be more confused by the policies and processes.  I also don't think it's
necessary to translate the technical documents.  To be a software
developer, one has to be educated or experienced in technical terms.
Technical discussion can be done without too much requirement to grammar
and emotional expressing.  The translated document of policies and
processes will help these people to understand the process better and go
smoother in the process.
