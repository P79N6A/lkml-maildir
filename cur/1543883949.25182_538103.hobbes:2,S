Wow, platform devices with a new name. I don't see how any of this is
not handled by platfrom device.
GPIO devices could be handled by a new resource type of GPIO
The only other item in the list which we do not yet have is a
form of the clock API which can be extended past the base CPU
clock implementation.
Anything registering new IRQs could create sub platform devices
with the correct resources.
