Hai,
   Thanks for the solution.  I did the above task, by defining a new
character device driver and sending ioctl to it. and calling
handle_scancode from it. Now I want
to do the same task with in the keyboard driver. For that I need to send
ioctl to keyboard device file.
For that only I asked the
above doubts.
regards,
P.Manohar.
