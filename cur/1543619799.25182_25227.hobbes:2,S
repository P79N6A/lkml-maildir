In the normal case, O_DIRECT can't be done on a file with a tail. 
The way I read generic_file_direct_IO, O_DIRECT is only done in 
units that start block aligned, and continue for a block aligned 
length.  So, this can never include a packed file tail.  
We should only need to worry if i_size on the file is wrong, and allows a 
read/write to a block aligned chunk on a file with a tail, which should
only be legal in the expanding truncate case from older kernels.  The
-EINVAL return should only happen in this (very unlikely) case.
