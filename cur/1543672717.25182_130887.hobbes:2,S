It's been pointed out repeatedly that there are a few which disagree with
this; they just did not feel compelled (yet?) into action over it.
But there is an important difference in binary modules vs binary
firmware blobs.
In the modules case, it's the binary modules provider which exposes
himself to legal issues.
In the firmware case, you are exposing the kernel itself to IP liability
issues. Do you really want that? (Think SCO)
