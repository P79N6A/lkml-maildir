MIME is no encoding, but a way to declare mail contents and encode
binary data. You need not use it on mail you send.
HTML is no encoding. (No doubt it's usually sent by people without A
Clue[tm] or being ruthless.)
quoted-printable is an encoding, and it's probably around for ten years
now. I can send base64 if you like that better, but then, even more
people will cry, while others don't even notice. 
Gnus 5.8 + Emacs, mutt, Netscape Communicator are three packages which
deal with MIME-"enhanced" mail.
Plus, people which use any characters beyond ASCII have no real choice
but to use MIME; if they have MTAs in between that don't talk
ESMTP/8BITMIME, then quoted-printable is what happens.
Use emil, metamail or such if you want to keep your mailer.
