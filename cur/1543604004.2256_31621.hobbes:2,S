I suspect the real definition should be
	"After this interface runs the device and other views of 
	 memory includes all dirty cache lines on the processor. On 
	 processors with cache coherent bus interfaces this may well
	 be a no operation
	 Footnote: AGP tends to have its own coherency and caching setup
	 so the AGP drivers use their own interfaces to avoid needless
	 overhead"
