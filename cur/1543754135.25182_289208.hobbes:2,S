It does apply to 2.6.11-rc1 (on top of your previous patch) with just
some minor chunk offsets.
The results are excellent...

I updated the summary information to include them...

These results are indistinguishable from SCHED_FIFO...

So, thread priorities clearly do matter, even in this relatively
simple test.  It's amazing how much is going on there, when you look
at it closely.
Is there any chance of these patches working with Ingo's latest RP
patchset?  I just downloaded realtime-preempt-2.6.11-rc2-V0.7.36-02,
but haven't built it yet.
