I'm running with this below patch applied since a some time (I didn't
submitted it because for some reason unless I do p->policy &=
~SCHED_YIELD ksoftirqd deadlocks at boot and I didn't yet investigated
why, and I'd like to have the whole picture on it first):

The only point of my previous email is that if a fork loop has very
invasive effect on the rest of the system that more probably indicates
people got bitten by the bug in the parent-timeslice logic, furthmore I
never noticed any sluggish behaviour on my systems and before posting my
previous email I had 1 definitive feedback that the bad beahviour
observed on vanilla 2.4.4 with parallel compiles in the background got
cured *completly* by my tree (that in the tested revision didn't
included the above inlined change yet). So I thought it was worth
mentioning about the effect of the parent-timeslice bugfix here too.
This doesn't mean I don't want something like the above inlined patch
integrated.
