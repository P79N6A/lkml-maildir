Hi all,
I have one problem with 2.0.0/2.0.1:
My EIDE-controller does not longer work as Busmaster-DMA.
Yes I have configured:
#
# Block devices
#
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=m
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDETAPE is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEFLOPPY is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640 is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000 is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD is not set
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
But the kernel reports at boot:
PIIX: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 08
PIIX: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PIIX: neither IDE port enabled (BIOS)
hda: IBM-DSOA-21080, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: IBM-DSOA-21080, 1033MB w/96kB Cache, CHS=525/64/63
You see, I have only one controller, the machine is a
IBM Thinkpad 760.
I am also not able to set dma with hdparm.
The situation with 2.0.36:
ide: i82371 PIIX (Triton) on PCI bus 0 function 9
ide0: BM-DMA at 0xfcf0-0xfcf7
Jan  4 10:00:58 Stinkpad kernel: hda: IBM-DSOA-21080, 1033MB w/96kB Cache, 
CHS=5 25/64/63, DMA
hdb: SANYO CRD-S54P, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
Any hints?
Michael
