Okay, so it can be done.
Is that really the right way to prepare disks for suspend? 
I sleep all devices by telling driverfs to sleep them. Should I tell
all block devices, then tell driverfs? Seems hacky to me. Or should
idedisk_suspend generate request for itself, then pass it through
queues?

Thanx.
