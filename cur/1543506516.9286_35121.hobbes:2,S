Subject: hpt366 ide controller + quantum KA 18GB = kernel hang

Hi, i have a Abit Hot Rod 66 PCI ide controller that uses the hpt366 chip.
When i plug my quantum 18GB KA drive into this controller, the kernel hangs
on boot right when its supposed to detect the cylinders/heads/sectors of
this drive.
The problem appears with the 2.2.10 and 2.2.11 kernel with the Uniform IDE
6.20 patch applied (this patch contains the hpt366 driver)
It works fine with quantum CR/EX 6.4GB drives using this controller. The
drive also works fine from my on-board via chipset controller.
I notice in the code there is a list of bad drives, the Quantum KA 13GB is
listed as a bad drive, maybe the 18GB KA has the same problems as the 13GB.
Can anyone confirm my problem or have any suggestions.
I had a look at the hpt366.c code to see what i could "tweak" but wasnt
quite brave enough to jump in, thought id mention it here first.
Maybe im missing something obvious.
Thanks
Glenn McGrath
