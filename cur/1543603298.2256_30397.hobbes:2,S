This already is done in the current NAPI patch which you should have seen
by now. NAPI is backward compatible: It would work just fine with 2.4 and
drivers can be upgraded slowly.
If theres anything that should make it into 2.4 then NAPI it should be
(with some componets from your code that still needs to be proven under
different workloads).

if you havent taken a look at NAPI please do so instead of creating these
nightly brainstorm patches. With all due respect, if you insist on doing
that please have the courtesy of at least posting results/numbers of how
this improved things and under what workloads and conditions.
I do believe that some of the pieces of what you have would help -- in
conjunction with NAPI.
A scenario where we have an appearing ksoftirqd, then disapearing and then
a new kpolld showing up just indicates very bad engineering/juju which
seems to be based on pulling tricks out of a hat.
Lets work together instead of creating chaos.
cheers,
