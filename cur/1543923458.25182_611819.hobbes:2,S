Sorry about that - I will do so in the future. Thanks for reviewing and fixing up.

I didn't think I did change the _einittext handling - just removed
_eextratext, and removed the trailing ||, and closed the parentheses for 
the if statement.
-  (s->addr == _einittext && strcmp((char*)s->sym + offset, "_einittext")) ||
+  (s->addr == _einittext && strcmp((char*)s->sym + offset, "_einittext")))
I think this is the same as what you have here - isn't it?
