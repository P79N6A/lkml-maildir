well I don't see your point there. Is ARCH_PFN_OFFSET != 0 supposed to work
with free_area_init() and init_bootmem() ? If so, there is a bug since
NODE_DATA(0)->node_start_pfn is not setup correctly...

I agree this is a separate issue. We should resolve it in a different thread.
Mind to start a new one that involve people who can shed some light here ?
