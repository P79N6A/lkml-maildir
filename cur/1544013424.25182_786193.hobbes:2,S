Just incase someone Google's this later on, this is what it looks like,
for my case:
The /dev/sda (first disk) is the one with the problem.
root@Knoppix:~/hpa# hdparm -N /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
  max sectors   = 293044655/293046768, HPA is enabled
root@Knoppix:~/hpa# hdparm -N /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb:
  max sectors   = 293046768/293046768, HPA is disabled
root@Knoppix:~/hpa# hdparm -N p293046768 /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
  setting max visible sectors to 293046768 (permanent)
  max sectors   = 293046768/293046768, HPA is disabled
root@Knoppix:~/hpa#
root@Knoppix:~# hdparm -N /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
  max sectors   = 293046768/293046768, HPA is disabled
root@Knoppix:~#
1. I backed up the volume of the RAID-1 array.
2. Failed out the disk with the problem.
3. Then ran the commands above.
4. Reboot back to the OS.
5. Re-add the disk back into the RAID-1.
Justin.
