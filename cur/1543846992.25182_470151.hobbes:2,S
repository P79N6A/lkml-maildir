Well you guys had everything under control so I was happy to stay
behind my rock :)
The original reason for the return value is so you can do
if (WARN_ON(impossible_condition)) {
	attempt_to_continue;
}
instead of 
if (unlikely(impossible_condition)) {
	WARN_ON(1);
	attempt_to_continue;
}
Oh and yes the unlikely does make a difference in a statement
expression.
Cheers,
