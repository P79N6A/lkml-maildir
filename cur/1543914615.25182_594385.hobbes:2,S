You cannot compare user base of -mm and release kernels. Also, note
that we're talking about maybe 0.01% of systems running Linux.
And similar patch appeared in various trees several times over the last

No, it's impossible for several reasons. Most obvious one is that a PCI-E
bridge does isolate stuff quite nicely.
