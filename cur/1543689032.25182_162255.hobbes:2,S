I am looking for Linux power pc kernel to download to support my power pc 440 processor box.  Some websites reject access and others takes very long time.  I am accessing Debian and found to download all 9 files, it may take a whole day to do so.
Does anyone knows a site where I can download installable linux ppc kernel or cd images faster?
Many thanks!
