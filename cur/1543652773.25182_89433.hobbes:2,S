I like your thinking, but the "pci->name" is really just a descrition, and
what should maybe be in the kobject is the "address", which is
"pci->slotname". The two are quite fundamentally different (ie nobody 
should depend on "name" being unique or constant anything like that, while 
"slotname" is really a bus-level address (*)).

(*) "slotname" is also not unique in general, it's only unique _within_ 
_that_ _bus_. With multiple PCI buses, for example, you can have two 
devices with the same slotname, if they are on separate segments.
