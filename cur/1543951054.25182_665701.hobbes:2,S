Not sure what you mean here, Andi.   
"MPOL_PREFERRED with -1 node" == "local allocation", right?  
Whereas, in the task mempolicy or vma policy or shared policy, the lack
of a specific policy--i.e., a null mempolicy pointer, or no policy at
that offset in a shared policy rbtree--means fall back to surrounding
context, right?  As far back as I've looked, mempolicy.c implemented
MPOL_DEFAULT, passed to set_mempolicy() or mbind(), by deleting the
target policy, resulting in "fall back".  
The only place that MPOL_DEFAULT actually occurs in a struct mempolicy
is in the system default policy.  I think we can simplify the code and
documentation--not have to explain the context dependent meaning of
MPOL_DEFAULT--by making it simply an API request to remove the target
policy and establish "default behavior" for that context--i.e.,
fallback.
