Yes. Also the print-eip patch may be useful to sort out lockups.

If you agree I can merge it into the ikd patch when your new one will be
ready. Also I think it's the time to port the IKD patch to 2.3.18ac1... ;)
I have a question about debuggers. Is kdb GPL'd? If so and if Scott will
agree I can merge it into the IKD patch while porting the current ikd
patch to 2.3.x. If I'll merge kdb I can remove the old debugger that
doesn't work for people (SIGTRAP probelem and I had not the time to go
into that myself).
