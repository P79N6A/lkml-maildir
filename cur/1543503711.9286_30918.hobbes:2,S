Sorry. If it gets your job done, great! I just think its an unfortunate
limitation of Linux. That Linux is optimized for throughput is great
for servers, and thats important. For personal workstations I don't think
its great. If you lost 10% performance and gained guaranteed maximum
jitters in the 1-3% range, I think that would be great for the multi-media
stuff thats becoming more and more part of desktop systems. And make it
more useful for soft real-time systems as well.
As for the parts of Linux, like the scheduling alogrithm, that appear
to be optimized for multi-user time sharing systems, thats flat-out
archaic, in my view. Maybe I'm wrong about this, but when you're the
only person at the console, "fairness" in sheduling is a little less
necessary: you started the damn thing, if you think its taking up
too much time from your sound-card, lower its priority!

I totally don't agree with "no guranteed deadlines", sorry. My last
company made remotely operated undersea vehicles (robots... they had
manipulators and lots of sensors). Its under water, nothing moves very
fast, so 50Hz control frequencies were common. That's 20 ms intervals.
However, *guranteed* response to error conditions and hardware failure was
required, that response had to be sub-second response, not
sub-microsecond, but it *still* had to be guranteed. Its soft realtime, we
didn't need 830 ms (+/- 3.25ms), but the O/S heading to sea, flushing its
disk cache, and blocking our A/D task for 1 1/2 seconds would make the
response noticeably choppy. Not having background data logging impact
control loops was also important, even if the loops were only 50Hz. And
controls engineers always want faster loops, they're never happy.

Agreed.
