    Yes I do have the support for vfat and msdos file system. I have
formatted the card on a Windows system with "FAT" file system.
#
# DOS/FAT/NT Filesystems
#
CONFIG_FAT_FS=y
CONFIG_MSDOS_FS=y
CONFIG_VFAT_FS=y
CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE=437
CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET="iso8859-1"
# CONFIG_NTFS_FS is not set
   Also, I have mounted proc and sysfs.
