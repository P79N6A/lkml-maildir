It may well be mostly as you say - the large-CPU systems not running
the fork() heavy jobs.
Sooner or later, someone will want to run a fork()-heavy job on a
large-CPU system.  On a 1024 CPU system, it would apparently take
just 14 exits/sec/CPU to hit this bottleneck, if Jay's number of
14000 applied.
Chris Sturdivant's reply is reasonable -- we'll hit it sooner or later,
and deal with it then.
