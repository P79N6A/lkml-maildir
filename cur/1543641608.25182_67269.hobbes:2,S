On a related note, it would be nice if procps would not parse things it
doesnt need:
strace ps 2>&1 | grep open | grep '/proc'
open("/proc/12467/stat", O_RDONLY)      = 7
open("/proc/12467/statm", O_RDONLY)     = 7
open("/proc/12467/status", O_RDONLY)    = 7
open("/proc/12467/cmdline", O_RDONLY)   = 7
open("/proc/12467/environ", O_RDONLY)   = 7
It always opens statm even when its not required.
