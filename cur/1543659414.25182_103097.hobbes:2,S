All I can say is me too... It seems as if the sound card is doing irq sharing and
strongly dislikes that... at least for me sound works for some seconds
then starts to stutter and crashes somewhen (within 30sec) later.
I was using kernel 2.4.18 (from debian woody).
I also tried alsa but some behaviour.
I saw that someone said he got it working, see:
 
http://larve.net/people/hugo/2002/12/evo410
But I could not find out how.
It would be pretty nice if APM / ACPI worked for the evo ... did you
try it yet ?
Soeren.
