I don't think so .. The common case with negative flags is no flags,
then next would be CLOCKSOURCE_UNSTABLE. At most I would guess two
flags .. The other direction your likely to have people using all flags
most of the time. That's why I showed a function call with all the flags
listed.
To be clear the clocksources are already sorted with a rating (no flags
involved). 
So for example, On i386 the clocks are sorts as follows,
tsc (300)
acpi_pm (200)
pit (110)
jiffies (1)
So the bulk of the positive information is already there for you. The
tsc clock is by far the best in the system if it's stable. If you ignore
the flags, then you will always be given the tsc .

It's meant as a negative feature. So you can mask it if you can't handle
the math .. The only 64bit clock I know off is the tsc, and it's got the
highest rating of all clocks.

Ok .. On my TODO list ..

Instead of using an unstable clock and trying to compensate for it, the
solution is not to use unstable clocks. The clocksource stuff does help
with that.. You can either use the tsc until it becomes unstable, or use
the acpi_pm clock which never becomes unstable. Both are used in the
same way.
