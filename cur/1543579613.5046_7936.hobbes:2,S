But if you have to, you can at least enjoy it:
 - diversity makes life interesting: use switch() with local variables or
   without curly braces
 - de-referencing is like a hotel: the more stars, the better
 - observe proper punctuation: use the comma operator frequently
 - know thy C: few people know that 5[x] is valid, but they can usually
   guess what it does. They probably won't get x[5[y]], though.
 - know thy CPP: nest macros and exercise token-concatenation and
   stingification
 - if your code allows you to, put  #define while if  in some header file
- Werner (couldn't resist ;-)
