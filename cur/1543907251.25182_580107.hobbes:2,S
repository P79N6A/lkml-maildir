One of the less documented bits of the PC architecture. It is possible to
arrange that the CPU jumps into a special mode when triggered by some
specific external event. Originally this was used for stuff like APM and
power management but some laptops use it for stuff like faking the
keyboard interface and the Geode uses it for tons of stuff.
As SMM mode is basically invisible to the OS what oprofile and friends
see isn't what really occurs. So you see
	pci write -> some address
you don't then see
	SMM
	CPU saves processor state
	Lots of code runs (eg i2c polling the battery)
	code executes RSM
	Back to the OS
and the next visible profile point. This can make an I/O operation look
really slow even if it isn't the I/O which is slow.

Is UDMA5 being selected firstly ?

Unlikely to be the disk driver as that really hasn't changed tuning for a
very long time. I/O scheduler interactions are however very possible.
