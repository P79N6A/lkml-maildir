   What is sad is the is an AGP standardised way to read this and XFree86
   still, all these years on, doesn't do it by default.
Totally agreed.
I have even suggested on the xfree86 developer list at least 2 times
that they do this to choose the default, but they claim it isn't the
right thing to do.
So people's boxes will keep hanging and xfree86 DRM will continue to
be a support nightmare.
