Subject: [patch 0/4] pci: store PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN in pci_dev

For surprise removal for pci hotplug, we need the value of the 
PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN for determining the correct interrupt to 
disable.  These patches will store the pin value in the 
pci_dev structure, and then use it where appropriate.  
Patches 1-3 are resends, with patch 4 being new.  I just resent
everything so that there's no confusion on what's the latest.
