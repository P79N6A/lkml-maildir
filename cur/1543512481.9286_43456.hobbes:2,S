I disagree.  I think it gives you a better framework for doing the right

That would be hideously expensive, since you're effectively proposing a
user-space callout for each *use* of a device. This doesn't seem
reasonable.

Again, that is where device name notification in the module files come
into the picture.  What I want to see is depmod, when scanning the
repository of available drivers, construct the appropriate /dev tree as
well as register which module belongs where, as opposed to requiring
complex information in /etc/conf.modules or such.
By having the device node in place on the filesystem for at the very
least each device present in the system (as opposed to currently in use
-- note that in most cases detecting the presence of the device doesn't
require the module to be loaded, and those cases that do can be
flagged), you ensure that the proper metadata is retained across load
and unload.

See above for autoloading.

This is a valid point, and I agree this should be a policy decision left
up to the user.  Presumably one can have a "--delete" argument to devd,
or some such.

The point that I'm trying to make is that having more than one interface
that affects everything is not acceptable.  I don't want to *prohibit*
devfs -- there are clearly applications for which it is useful -- but I
also believe it is the wrong thing in general.  Therefore, the interface
which has to touch everything needs to do both.
