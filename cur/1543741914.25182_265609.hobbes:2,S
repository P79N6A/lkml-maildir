I really wonder why is it risky? 99% of the time USB is loaded eventually
and does handoff anyway. What is the problem doing it earlier? Ones who
indeed use USB in legacy mode will have to boot with "no-handoff". I think
if you look at the numbers people using USB in legacy mode is a fraction
of a percent.
Plus, now we suggest disabling legacy emulation in BIOS which is problematic
if one wants to use USB keyboard in boot loader... Automatic handoff will
help here.
