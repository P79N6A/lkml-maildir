I am upgrading kernel from 2.4.20-8(default in RH9) to 2.6.xx. when I do
"make" command it gives some output and finally get error saying that,
"BFD: Warning: Writing section '.bss' to huge ( ie negative) file offset
0xc0244000. "
 "Objcopy: arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin: file truncated"
"make[2]:***[ arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin] Error 1"
 "make[1]: ***[ arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux] Error 2"
 "make: *** [bzImage] Error 2"
Thanks
