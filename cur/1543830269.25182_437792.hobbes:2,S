i know it's a hard problem, and i'm not suggesting at all that this is 
easy to fix. Nevertheless there are 130 allocation callsites in XFS that 
do implicit GFS_NOFAIL in essence, and 7 callsites in GFS2 that mention 
__GFS_NOFAIL explicitly. Ext3 does __GFP_NOFAIL in its journalling code 
too. Reiser too.
