Hi,
It would appear that the changes in pre3 and pre4 break
RAID autorun.  This is rather bothersome for those who
have RAIDed root filesystems.
It's probably solely an init-order thing but, short of
moving the software RAID drivers into drivers/md/, I
can't see an easy way to fix it.
cheers,
Matthew.
