Hi,
Append capability is the thing I'm currently adding to Squashfs.  Once 
finished, you'll be able to add new files/directories to the top level 
directory of a previously created filesystem.  As the mksquashfs program 
performs duplicate file checking against the files in the filesystem as 
well as the files being added, this means it will also work as a kind of 
incremental archiving filesystem.
An initial release should be ready in a week (or two depending on free 
time).
