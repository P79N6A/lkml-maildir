The "or any other emulator" is exactly where my question is directed at.
Xen, KVM or even qemu come into my mind, but considering how loudly you 
complained about a temporary breakage for VirtualBox there must be a 
reason why your work on the Debian Installer can only be done 
effectively and efficiently with an emulator module that has AFAIK not 
been submitted for inclusion in the kernel.
