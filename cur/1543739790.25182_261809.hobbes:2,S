While the system calls may be broken in theory (multiple domains) they are 
not broken in practice (single-domain workstations), and they _were_ used 
by X, at least on alpha last time I looked.
And no, expectign X to have a fallback and to understand multiple domains 
is likely not a valid expectation.
So right now X may work only on single-domain setups, or on setups where 
the video card has a unique address when ignoring the domnain number. 
That's pretty much all of the affected machines, so no, I don't think we 
can/should remove it.
Will X eventually learn about multiple domains? Maybe.
