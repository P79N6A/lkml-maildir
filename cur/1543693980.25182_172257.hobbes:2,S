My preferred approach to this would be to move all the global inode lists
into the superblock so both they and inode_lock become per-sb.
It is a big change though.  And, amazingly, nobody has yet hit sufficient
inode_lock contention to warrant it.
Yes, I bet that this search will hurt like hell on a really big box which
has thousands of auto-expiring NFS mounts.  Please test your patch and I'll
queue it up while we think about it some more.
