   Is there any reason this should fail? It does not fail when talking
   to a linux host. The only obvious difference is windows generates
   two ACK's of the server's FIN.
Well, there were quite a few TCP bugs fixed after 2.2.14.  Can you
test things our with a more recent 2.2.x kernel?  I don't have any
windows systems handy to make this test, but if you can still
reproduce it with current 2.2.x kernels and get me a tcpdump I can get
the problem fixed.
The app you posted empties the read data just fine.  The RST you are
seeing is not due to that, I am sure.
