I'm seeing pseudorandom hard lockups soon after boot on a Dell Latitude C840.
It just siezes up, even alt-sysrq is totally wedged, need to power cycle to
recover.  There doesn't seem to be a really obvious trigger - the first time it
died after all the /etc/rc5.d scripts, while trying to start the X server. The
second, I brought it up single-user, and it didn't even live long enough to
give me a prompt.  Multiple attempts hung at different places, but always
within 2-3 minutes.
2.6.18-rc1-mm1 works fine, as does 2.6.18-rc2 plus origin.patch and git-libata-all.patch
(vanilla -rc2 won't recognize my piix controller, not in a mood to reconfigure
to use ide rather than libata).
Off to go play bisect-the-mm, though it may be later in weekend before I
finish that...
