Don't worry. Netware (NW6) uses also 32bit for indices to page cache, 
and 4KB page cache size, but in addition to our implementation they 
(1) do not verify that file you created is smaller than 16TB, and 
(2) they have signedness bug somewhere too. So if you'll create file 
larger than 8TB, data you wrote in are silently discarded, while
file size is preserved.
I was really surprised when I updated ncpfs to access files > 4GB.
Written data were disappearing after server reboot :-(
Just my two cents.
