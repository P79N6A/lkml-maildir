I've got a number of changes I want to make to the menuconfig layout, but the 
feature freeze was coming down by the time I started getting actual patches 
done.  (The bunzip patch is on the back burner for similar reasons.)
Let me know when you have something to test and I'll try to take a look, and 
possibly clean up my own menuconfig to-do list to something legible and 
bounce it off you.  (Things like "Universal Serial Bus is a bus, we have a 
buses menu, but USB is not under it, why?".  The config layout is somewhere 
between "random" and "looney" at this point, actually...)
And in 2.6.1, can we finally move MPT fusion support into the SCSI menu?  I've 
been harping on this forever, most recently submitting a patch in August...

But I've been intermittently bugging the list about it for over two years 
now...

Yeah, it's small and cosmetic.  But it's annoying. :)
