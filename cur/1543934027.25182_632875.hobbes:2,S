Great, thanks for that.

Okay, that's pretty specific. Given that these things exist on actual ISA 
cards and "I/O recovery time" BIOS settings that are availabe also on these 
old 386s already it's probably still at least somewhat debatable how much 
linux drivers really need to care even in this case -- but let's ignore that.

Okay. Am about to go stuff my face with new years celebrations but will 
definitely try to make that old WD8003 hickup.
By the way, expected, but before anyone else mentions it -- no, reading from 
port 0x61 is not a reliable delay today. Duron 1300 / AMD756:
rene@7ixe4:~/src/port80$ su -c ./portime
out 0x80: 2400 cycles
in  0x80: 2400 cycles
in  0x61: 2400 cycles
But PII 400 / Intel 440BX:
rene@6bap:~/port80$ su -c ./portime
out 0x80: 545 cycles
in  0x80: 254 cycles
in  0x61: 254 cycles
