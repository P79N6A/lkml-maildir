Hello
The kernel 2.2.2 doesn't boot with SCSI support enable.
When SCSI support is enable, the kernel start booting normaly but crash
after the SCSI devices 
detection with the message :
scsi : detected 2 SCSI cdroms 1 SCSI disk total.
(scsi0:0:1:0) Synchronous at 5.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.52
(scsi0:0:2:0) Synchronous at 5.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
"bug : kernel timer added twice at c4b......"
It crashes just before printing the hard drive protocols informations.
The only thing to do is to reboot and restart with 2.2.1
The kernel boots fine when I disable the SCSI support.
The system is a PII 400 with an Adaptec 2940UW (aic7xxx) SCSI board on
an Asus P2B motherboard.
Bye
	Thierry
