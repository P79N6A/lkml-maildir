That's my point.  :-)  I didn't say I have the /only/ interface in the VFS,
but that I'm proposing an /alternate/ interface at that level; in which
I do things a bits differently.  For one, I dissociate the attributes from
the ACL entirely; but that doesn't prevent the filesystem from implementing
one in terms of the other.
