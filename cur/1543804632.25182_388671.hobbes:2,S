In the case of ARM machine types, it is the opposite of Greg's
statement.  There's getting on for 1000 ARM machine types.  We have
some 72 machine types currently merged and buildable.
If everyone merged their little-used ARM machine type - say we got
to 250 types, the maintainence burden on _me_ personally would be,
to put it mildly, prohibitive.  Rather than fixing up all machine
support code when I made any change, I'd ignore most of them and
just do the ones I was interested in.
That results in most merged code falling into a state where it's
essentially broken, and a _lot_ more folk whinging about change.
Alternatively, as I said in my other recent mail, we could stagnate.
Here's a thought - if this is soo important, would you pay me to
stagnate the ARM part of the kernel tree? 8)  (rmk thinks... could
run this as a "highest bidder gets their way") 8)
