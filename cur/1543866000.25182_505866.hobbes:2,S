  It is only that much bigger if you compare to 16 bits integer compilers,
 but once you deal with 32 bits integers in real mode you have one extra byte
 out of the two - which is still better than dealing with dx:ax.
 Last time I compiled (long time ago) some piece of code with and without
 .code16gcc it was approx 15% bigger - approx what you get when optimising.
 Etienne.
