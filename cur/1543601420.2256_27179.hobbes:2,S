here it's really completly private to the bdev. I mean we could be
tricky and force a cast on mapping->host to point to bdev and we
wouldn't need the fake inode. But casts are probably uglier and more
risky than using the fake_inode (unless we really consdier the host a
cookie rather than an inode pointer). Comments?
