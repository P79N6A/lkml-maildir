Reiserfs uses much more complex data structures then ext2 (trees..). I don't
think that latency has ever been a design criteria and all of the benchmarks
they use are pretty much pure throughput tests.
So it wouldn't be really surprising if reiserfs had very bad latency. You
should apply the timepegs patch and profile your kernel latency to see where
it's coming from.
