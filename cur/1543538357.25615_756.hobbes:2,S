Here's a paragraph from the rationale for exec*():
  POSIX.1 specifies that signals set to SIG_IGN remain set to SIG_IGN
  and that process signal mask be unchanged across an exec.  This is
  consistent with historical implementations, and it permits some useful
  functionality, such as the nohup command.  However, it should be
  noted that many existing applications wrongly assume that they start
  with certain signals set to the default action and/or unblocked.  In
  particular, applications written with a simpler signal model that does
  not include blocking of signals, such as the one in the C Standard,
  may not behave properly if invoked with some signals blocked.
  Therefore it is best not to block or ignore signals across execs
  without explicit reason to do so, and especially not to block signals
  across execs of arbitrary (not closely co-operating) programs.
So the committee knew about the problems, and wanted this behaviour
anyway.  But friendly programs shouldn't do an exec with blocked
signals, and robust programs shouldn't assume that they are started
with an empty sigal mask.
