The problem will be ACPI related, not particular to swsusp or Suspend2, which  
is why you're seeing it with both implementations. I would suggest that you 
contact the ACPI guys, and also look to see whether there is a bios update 
available and/or a DSDT override for your machine. The later will help if the 
problem is with your particular machine's ACPI support, the former if it's a 
more general ACPI issue.

Nigel
