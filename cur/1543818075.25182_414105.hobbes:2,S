Ok, when kernel developers throw "everything" to libraries and let them encapsulate "everything", it sounds like old story: hardware engineers hope software engineers to do more things, however, software engineers think it reservedly. And for application engineers, it is also unfair because they have to follow new features added by libraries even worse have to update their programs from time to time. Who knows library programmers never change their own interface in order to keep to trace new kernel due to similar functionalities but different interfaces. 
               Kernel size UP -> Library size UP -> Application size UP (chain reaction)
I don't know if the time when users complain that their systems are running slowly and slowly and memory is becoming scarce even if fastest CPU (whatever single or multiple cores) and tons of memory is coming very soon. By the way, it is pleasure to discuss the problem with you

Your requirement should be done by a userspace library, in fact, most of
functions provided by kernel are exported
to the final application in this way
