This looks the same as the problem Badari and I have hit with the qla running
with mm patches, check Badari's latest message on linux-scsi:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=103599960611881&w=2

Incorrect number of segments after building list
counted 3, received 2
req nr_sec 256, cur_nr_sec 8
