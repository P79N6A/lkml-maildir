Question: Since tty_flip_buffer_push just shoves the request onto tq_timer,
is it valid to use a private tty_flip_buffer_push that checks if the buffer
is looking close to full and pushes it onto tq_immed then marks that queue
to be run on the irq return (remembering we have no fast irq paths in 2.2
any more)
In fact, couldnt tty_flip_buffer_push do this ?
