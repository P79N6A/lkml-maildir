Thanks.

That (count && off) == 0 looks odd.  Are you sure that's what you meant to
do?
Also, a write() handler shouldn't return zero if it didn't write anything. 
Some applications will see that the write() returned less than expected and
didn't return an error so they'll just loop around and try to write more
data.  They'll hang up when writing to your sysfs file.
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/write.html
 says
RETURN VALUE
    Upon successful completion, write() and pwrite() shall return the
    number of bytes actually written to the file associated with fildes. 
    This number shall never be greater than nbyte.  Otherwise, -1 shall be
    returned and errno set to indicate the error.
So you should return -EINVAL here, and perhaps -EACCES or -EPERM.  Because
nothing was written.
