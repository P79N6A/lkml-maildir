Yes.

That's true. "Soundcard" is actually a small understatement. :)
Why should I make a new design for it, then it fits nicely into the
current design?

ioremapped memory is not the same (that's what we do right now), you have
to fake some virtual address to get the data to the right physical
location.

I agree, it's a special setup.

It's about direct i/o from/to pages, for that you need a page struct (so
the ioremapping doesn't work). See the memory on the pci card as normal
memory, except that you can't allocate it normally, but you can still
organize it like normal memory. All you need to do is to setup this memory
area, then you can use it like normal memory, e.g. I can put it into the
page cache and I can do a normal read/write with it. The changes are very
minor, but it would solve so much other problems (especially alias
issues).
I know, that this isn't possible with any hardware combination,
nonetheless it's not that a big problem to support it where it's possible.
bye, Roman
