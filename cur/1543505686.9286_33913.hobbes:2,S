It's such an obvious solution, unfortunatly it's a little less obvious
that it's crap :-)
BTW: Are you still making (going to make) the short names usable from
the UNIX level? I'm still against it and now have a reason; With the
arrival of devfs almost any filesystem will be able to serve as a root
filesystem as character and block devices are no longer needed.
(Eg: Novell NCP or Amiga FFS) With the short names 'available' I for one
would be very reluctant to try VFAT as a root filesystem. This would
(I think) leave just the MSDOS and VFAT r/w filesystems unable to do root ...
