That would be incorrect usage.  pfn_valid() simply doesn't tell you if 
you have memory backing a pfn, it mearly means you can interrogate the 
page* for it.  A good example of code which counts pages in a region is 
in count_highmem_pages() which has a form as below:
			for (pfn = start; pfn < end; pfn++) {
  				if (!pfn_valid(pfn))
                                         continue;
                                 page = pfn_to_page(pfn);
                                 if (PageReserved(page))
                                         continue;
				num_physpages++;
			}
