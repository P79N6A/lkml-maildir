thanks, applied.

yeah, that seems to be the case:
in drivers/pnp/pnpbios/Kconfig:
 config PNPBIOS
 ...
         depends on ISA && X86 && EXPERIMENTAL
in arch/x86/Kconfig:
 if X86_32
 config ISA
it seems the PNPBIOS has not infested the 64-bit world, so we wont ever 
see this with a 64-bit kernel:
                extern u32 pnp_bios_is_utter_crap;
                pnp_bios_is_utter_crap = 1;
                printk(KERN_CRIT "PNPBIOS fault.. attempting recovery.\n");
