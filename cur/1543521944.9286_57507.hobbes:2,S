replace_with_higmem is a _memory-usage_ optimization (not a performance
optimization).
The reason of my GFP_ATOMIC choice is that I don't want to steal pages at
all. Not to go faster but because if the system is just low in memory it
means the high memory is been used completly as well so there's no point
in trying to put the anonymous data into highmem in such case.
