Another suggestion:
  A target that always returns a block of zeros [or more generally,
  some other repeating pattern e.g. if the read goes beyond the end
  of your file - required to be multiple of sector size - it loops 
  round to the beginning; writes get dropped]
So you can easily create, for example a /dev/zero-like block device of
arbitrary size, which might be useful for replacing a lost disk that
contained a stripe if you want to read off the data from the other
stripes at correct offsets.
