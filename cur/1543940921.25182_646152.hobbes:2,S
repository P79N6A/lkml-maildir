Now I'm confused. The patch has been acked a few weeks ago and the last
5+ version of the patch had the acked line. The lastest version dropped
it for a reason I don't know. And more, the patch is already upstream
with the (correct) acked line, see git commit
f034347470e486835ccdcd7a5bb2ceb417be11c4.
So, what is the problem ?
