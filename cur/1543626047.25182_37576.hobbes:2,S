Open collector ~= a Tri-State or a float.
It does exist for the "DATA" lines, and those are not setup to float until
there is a referrence ground to set the buffer on the ATA drive.
ATAPI (best known by me is HP-Colorado 8GB tape) will suck power off the
ribbon if there is no line voltage applied to the Molex connector.
I hate to say of you are core developing on a laptop, you are not playing
w/ native hardware.  Laptops to special things, period.
ATA does not goe the distance because they did not put line drivers of any
strength, the the $5.00 difference in the controllor on the bottom of the
drive.  Also I have cables which are 3 feet and run in mode 5 or Ultra100,
but you can be sure that it is a special HOST to provide the push and
power to make the distance.  It has 80c headers on the HOST side but 40c
IDC's on the device side.
There is majic and it gets released if you do it wrong and form bricks.
