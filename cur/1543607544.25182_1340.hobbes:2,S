Might I suggest a single file interface then?
Say /dev/video0/config, which would hold
hue: 0
saturation: 0
brightness: 0
etc..
which one could open and read or write param: value to.
This, or with the linux wireless config tools, is how the airo module allows you to modify

Software is something like a machine, and something like mathematics, and something like
language, and something like thought, and art, and information.... but software is not in
fact any of those other things.
