This might confuse CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, which uses THREAD_SIZE to
detect the end of the kernel stack in store_stackinfo() in mm/slab.c
and kstack_end() in include/linux/sched.h, and the sizing heuristic
for max_threads in fork_init().
Also, how is this meant to interoperate with CONFIG_KERNEL_STACK_ORDER?
It seems to ignore the setting from the config option.
