I hope you can understand that this mentality is _exactly_ what has
some in the BSD community so upset.
when I see the linux community start to take credit for works they
did not create and I see the linux community respond to warnings
that people in the community are going overboard and jeopardizing
the linux community, which we do all benefit from, with a more or
less "whatever" attitude, it makes me sad.  it would be like losing
a friend.  I don't like losing friends, so I get vocal.
I don't understand why the linux community can't seem to say, "We
can accept BSD licensed code.  There's no need to add the GPL to
it."  and maybe even, "Although we strongly prefer the GPL,
respect for other licenses is every bit as important as respect
for the GPL."
I could be wrong, but I strongly believe that if the above was
truly accepted and believed by the community, the actions that
started and spread this whole debacle^Wdebate would not have
happened in the first place.
look, the GPL legally forces others to keep the same license.
the BSD community is asking the linux community do the same.
and when the linux community refuses, what do you expect the
recourse to be?
