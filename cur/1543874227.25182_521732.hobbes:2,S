I'm just a little paranoid about ABI's.  There is always something
that crops up.  And while we can probably cope by simply having another
version of the signalfd or whatever your syscall is, but having to do
that at the first sign of trouble sucks.  Especially since we would have
to maintain two versions indefinitely.

Ok.  That sounds more efficient than playing with struct pid pointers,
if it works.
