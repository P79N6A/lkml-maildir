As Pavel noted, provided you remember only to use safe programs and are
absolutely sure that nothing, including the commands in the Makefile you
haven't read, will overwrite a file, you are safe.
Come to think of it, chmod -R a-w would be enough to guarantee that for
all reasonable programs.
Except Emacs.  Some of us turn on backup-by-copying-when-linked even
though it breaks the `cp -al' method because turning it off breaks other
things.  Perhaps I should code an elisp "if editing in /usr/src turn off
backup-by-copying-when-linked". :-)
enjoy,
