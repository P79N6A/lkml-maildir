Subject: [2.6 patch] arch/arm/kernel/bios32.c: no need to set isa_bridge
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/1/29

Since this assignment was the only place on !alpha where isa_bridge was 
touched, it didn't have any effect.
