Yes, the timing could have been better.  Whatever.
I agree with Andi that it should be moved back to the ix86 Processor

It does default to Y and can only be changed if EMBEDDED is enabled.
I don't think that it really should be in the Kernel hacking menu.

Put DOUBLEFAULT option back in the i386 Processor menu, but
not at the very top of it like it was originally, where it
was out of place in the menu structure.
