I'd rather get a list of API changes planned for 2.5 and DO ONLY THEM.
IOW, start 2.5 with a sequence of patches that do nothing but a global
search-and-replace.  Then treat it as -STABLE.  It _is_ doable - check
what had happened to superblock handling in 2.4.  Yes, it takes extra
work on splitup and doing things in compatible way, but it's not a
rocket science - BTDT.
"I can't be arsed to split my K'R4D 3133t 200Kb p47cH" had lost its charm
years ago - just look at the devfs mess...
