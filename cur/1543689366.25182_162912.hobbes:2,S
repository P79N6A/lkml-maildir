Yeah, it's definitely an interesting development environment at least.
FYI, most of the discussions in Ottowa centered around system call 
overhead (4 TLB flushes per, IIRC), but the cache footprint is interesting
too ... with the O(1) sched in the underlying OS, it shouldn't flip-flop
around too easily, but interesting, nonetheless.
