Linux NMI watchdog does that.
All other perfctr users are supposed to keep their fingers away 
from the watchdog (it looks like oprofile doesn't but not for much
longer ...) 
I think it's also a useful convention - RDTSC is becomming more and more
useless and you cannot expect user applications who just want to
measure some cycles to rely on ever changing instable or non existing
performance counter APIs.

The same covert channel would exist with RDTSC so that argument is bogus.
