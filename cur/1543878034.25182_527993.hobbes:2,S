Yes, I suck at writing changelogs, bad me. Normally I would take a day
to write them, but I just wanted to get this code out there. Perhaps a
bad decision.

Lets start with the why, because of 12/12; I wanted to introduce per BDI
congestion feedback, and hence needed a BDI context for
congestion_wait(). These specific callers weren't in the context of a
BDI but of a more global idea.
Perhaps I could call page_alloc_ok() from bdi_congestion_end()
irrespective of the actual BDI uncongested? That would more or less give
the old semantics.
