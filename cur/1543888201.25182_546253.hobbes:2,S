Hello All
           I found one more interesting thing related with fork
bombing attack. i have set following in /etc/security/limits.conf file
     #@root    hard  nproc  3000
     #@anand hard  nproc  500
I have tried to execute fork bombing program on the same machine. it
killed the box completely and machine needed a reboot. will any body
please tell me why this is so? even after setting limits in
/etc/security/limits.conf file.
about ulimit:
ulimit are by default  set to some value for all users.. root, guest.
on my machine with FC4 distribution when i typed command "ulimit -u"
it gave me output as 3055 and another machine having FC6 distribution
output is 8050. when root or any other user changes ulimit by typing
"ulimit -u value",.ulimit value is changed for that session and not
permantely. actually ulimit should help to prevent fork bombing attack
but it wont and fork bombing attack still take down the machine having
latest linux distributions.
will any please tell me why this is so?
Regards
Anand
