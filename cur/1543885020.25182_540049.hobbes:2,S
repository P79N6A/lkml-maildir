I think we must return an error from the kernel and let user mode sort
it out; potentially by breaking up the operation into smaller pieces, or
(ick), simply falling back to software. Eliminating per-submit flushing
will even make this reasonably efficient as we remap the GTT as objects
are used. I don't think we want to support automatic partitioning of the
operation in the kernel; punting that step to user mode seems like a
sensible option.
Certainly presenting all of the objects to the kernel atomically will
permit it to succeed if the device can possibly perform the operation;
ejecting all existing objects and reloading with precisely the objects
proposed by the application can be done, and is even inexpensive on UMA
hardware.

Yeah, especially as we don't currently have any examples in our
environment.
