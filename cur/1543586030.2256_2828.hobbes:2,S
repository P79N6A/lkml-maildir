IRIX allows the partition (logical volume identification) to list
every volumn name as a device. Then you can mount via the name. Disks
can be relocated while the system is shutdown and the mounts still
work after boot.
My suggestion would be to add a filesystem label (optional) to the
homeblock of all filesystmes, then load that identifier into the
/proc/partitions file. This would allow a search to locate the
device parameters for any filesystem being mounted. If the label
is unavailable, then it must be mounted manually or via the current
structure. This would work for floppy/CD/DVD (although SCSI versions
would have a relocation problem for these devices).
