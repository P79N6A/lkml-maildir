Its basically the same software API but different hardware. But
I would actually welcome a driver integration. If you would be willing to
let me wedge the mmtimer specifics into the hpet.c driver ;-). I would
insist though that the way mmtimer maps its timer to userspace
be also supported by the hpet driver and that you will not insist on
preserving the current memory layout of the userspace mapping for hpet.
The rest of the API could be shared to large extend.
