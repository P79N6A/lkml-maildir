I experienced a reproducible lockup while loading the PPA (IOmega ZIP
on parport) on 2.2.19 and 2.2.20, on a bi-pIII machine.  It seems OK
with SMP in 2.4.17, and works fine with UP in 2.2.x.
I narrowed the problem to the case where:
- parport_pc gets loaded on request of ppa
- it is the initial insmod of ppa
That is, it works fine when:
- either parport_pc is insmod'd manually first
- either ppa has been successfully loaded previously (using manual
insmod of parport_pc).  Then even if parport_pc has been unloaded,
"modprobe ppa" loads everything OK.
