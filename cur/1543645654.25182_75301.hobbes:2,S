There are several new CONFIG_ options you need to configure to get
keyboard/mouse working in 2.5. Asides from this, everything has
'just worked' for me.  There are some keyboards out there that are
still having slight problems, but Vojtech is working his way through
these.
If anyone is still having "keyboard/mouse doesn't work" problems in 2.5
after enabling the relevant CONFIG_ options, enable the DEBUG defines
in i8042.c, and let Vojtech (vojtech@suse.cz) know about it.
The biggest problems (all?) in this area should be long gone now.
