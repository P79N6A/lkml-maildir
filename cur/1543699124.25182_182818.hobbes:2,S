Hi,
I have integrated some of the several enhancements submitted by TimeSys 
Corporation into mainline kgdb at 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/
 The kgdb 
version containing these features is 1.7. It's available for kernel 2.4.23. 
Here is a brief description of the enhancements.
1. Hasslefree gdb detach reconnect:
You can now detach gdb from a kgdb stub by using gdb "detach" command. 
Reconnection later is as simple as typing "target remote" command from gdb.
2. Restructured source files:
Several kgdb source files have been restructured to separate architecture 
dependent and independent code into respective directories. It's a move 
towards making unification of kgdb sourcecode from different architectures.
