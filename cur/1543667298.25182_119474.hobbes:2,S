Alan,
The AMD Opus ide driver is also displaying symptoms of the 
same problem I had in 2.4.21-ac with UDMA100.  To refresh, 
it was detecting 80w as 40w and 40w as 80w [reverse logic]. 
  I am going to try the same fix which was posted for my 
2.4.21-ac problem.  I'll let you know if it worked...
Cheers,
Nicholas
