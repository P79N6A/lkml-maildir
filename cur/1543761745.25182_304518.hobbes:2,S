Hi,
Looking at linux-2.6.11/fs/namespace.c line 418:
if (mnt == current->fs->rootmnt && !(flags & MNT_DETACH)) {
     /*
        * Special case for "unmounting" root ...
I wonder is this really a test for root? Couldn't the current->fs->rootmnt 
"point" somewhere else if per-process namespaces are used? Is it intended 
that processes can't umount their own root, or better to say, to only be 
able to remount it read-only?
