I have to apologize.  I tried to restrain myself as long as possible,
but I finally couldn't stand it anymore and posted one post.
anyhow, to answer your question, a  more appropriate rule might be:
:0 E
* ^FROM_DAEMON:.*owner-linux*.
* ^Subject:.*GNU/Linux*.
/dev/null
Let me know how well it works.
