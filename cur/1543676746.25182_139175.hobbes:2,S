The point is that the POSIX norm specifies the problem in a different
way:
"The suspension time may be longer than requested because the argument
value is rounded up to an integer multiple of the sleep resolution or
because of the scheduling of other activity by the system. But, except
for the case of being interrupted by a signal, the suspension time shall
not be less than the time specified by rqtp, as measured by the system
clock CLOCK_REALTIME."
Basicaly, this means the user must be assured that the sleep() will
ALWAYS return after the specified time. This patch corrects a bug wich
could happen nearly 50% of the time you called sleep()!
