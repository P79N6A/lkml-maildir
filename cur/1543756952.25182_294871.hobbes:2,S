I really think the fewer restrictions you put on BK's use, the less likely it 
will be copied.  When the open source community copies something, it's not out 
of a desire to screw somebody over.  It's because they had an itch, a 
software need that couldn't easily be fulfilled otherwise, a demand.
Apparently there is a demand for good SCM, and BK can satisfy this, and you've 
done the very admirable thing of letting the open source community use BK at 
no cost.  But by putting such a heavy restriction on its use, you create a 
large portion of the community who won't or can't use it, and who therefore 
need a "copy" of it, which is exactly what you are trying to prevent.
This segment wouldn't be slowed down much by the restrictions anyway.  As long 
as the BT users who ask for features aren't "working on" the project (however 
you define that), they're almost certainly safe.  And even if they are, if 
they can afford a day in court, they have a chance of winning.  (I'm NOT 
suggesting anybody do this, just saying it's possible.)
Better for you would be to just not create this segment in the first place, by 
making the license as unrestrictive as you can while still making money.  If 
you take the non-compete clause out and leave it at "open repository and 
logs," then BT would be good enough for most everybody, and you wouldn't have 
to worry about a copy until after we're all using the Hurd.
Just a thought,
