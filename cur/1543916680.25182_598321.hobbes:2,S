I've been mostly offline since KS (since a bit before in fact), so I
missed some of those discussions but so that you know, I'm toying a bit
with mmu gather and page table accessors at the moment, and one of the
things I've been contemplating is just that ... integrating a quicklist
in the gather to handle just that (and possibly other issues that have
been overlooked on some archs).
I'd suggest just reverting the patch for now (well, I see from the
commit list that you did just that) and I'll try to come up with
something better.
Christoph, I'd be happy if you didn't start butchering mmu_gather just
right now since I'm doing just that and it will collide all over the
place :-) Or if you want something specific done, please throw
ideas/patches at me and I'll integrate that in my serie.
Cheers,
Ben.
