I didn't saw your patch on linux-kernel, and although Len has said that 
he'd apply my patches I have yet to hear an answer indicating either 
problems in my patches or that he'd applied them.
Did Len already integrate your driver into his tree?
If yes, I will correct the acpi_remove_gpe_block case (it's only this 
one function?) as soon as his tree appears in the next -mm.
