Yes, I can see the potential for a problem there.

I don't know if enter_lazy_tlb is appropriate.  It is used in
two contexts: getting ready to swap context (eg that one) and
not planning on swapping context any time soon (eg start_lazy_tlb).
But perhaps there's no issue at all with the later, since the
"host" process can't really die without some sort of swpctx.
Try this.
