I got this OOPS while running a relatively intensive PostgreSQL load on
my dual-CPU PIII with 2.6.9, while simultaneously running top.  Sorry,
no serial console, but I do have a screenshot:

mov    %eax,0x48(%esp)                # store into ppid
It sure looks like the culprit is the dereference of real_parent.
        read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
        ppid = task->pid ? task->real_parent->pid : 0;
        read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
Since I have DEBUG_PAGEALLOC turned on, I have the feeling that,
although eax is an apparently valid address (d1a0ea90), that particular
address was actually unmapped because the task had been freed at the
time.  Is there a reference that needs to be taken on ->real_parent
somewhere?
Anyway, this was with 2.6.9, and I've been so far unable to reproduce it
on the same kernel.  Although I'm not running current -bk, it looks like
there's been some churn in the same area since 2.6.9, so maybe it was
fixed.  
Thought I'd report it, just in case someone else sees the same thing.
