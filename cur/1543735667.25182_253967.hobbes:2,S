You are correct, variable initialization can be removed. I will do this.

Humm, I guess recursion should be fine and even though the code does not have
an explicit limit, the ACPI namespace describing the Ejectable device will limit the
number of recursible devices. And I believe this won;t be more than 3 to 4 level depth.
Hence recursion is fine here.
If you still strongly believe that recursion is not the right choice here, 
let me know and I will convert it to iteration.
Thanks,
Anil
