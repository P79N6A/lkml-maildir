I looked a bit at what it would take to have the TF bit handled by the
sysenter path, and it might not be so horrible - certainly not as ugly as
the register restore bits.
Jamie, if you want to do it, it looks like you could add a new "work" bit
in the thread flags, and add it to the _TIF_ALLWORK_MASK tests. At least
that way it wouldn't touch the regular code, and I don't think that the
result would have any strange "magic EIP" tests or anything horrible like
that ;)
