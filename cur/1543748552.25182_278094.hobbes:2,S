Here is one more. Currently imm uses page_address() which can crash on
highmem. It's not directly doable to map the pages properly, at least
not without changing some code. In lack of a ->bounce_highio member in
the scsi host template, just set ->unchecked_isa_dma which will just
bounce everything for us. imm isn't performance critical by any stretch
of the imagination, so...
Usually I'd not encourage such a silly hack, but in lack of hardware for
testing (who has it??), this should suffice as it is obviously correct.
