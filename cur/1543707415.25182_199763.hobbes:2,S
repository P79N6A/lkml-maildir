Unfortunately, you have a valid point... I don't like it, because it
means work for me, but it is a valid point... 
I am just reading up on dm now, but correct me if I am wrong, I will
need to do losetup, dmcreate, mount in that order in order to use
dmcrypt on loop where with cryptoloop, I could just do "mount"... there
must be an easier way to handle this!
Thanks,
Brandon
