Hi,
this patch for 2.4.10 adds support for the Intel i830 chipset to the agpgart
module, thus eliminating the need for "agp_try_unsupported" with this chip.
It seems to work fine on my Siemens Fujitsu notebook which has an ATI Radeon
Mobility M6 graphics chip.
I guess it should work for others too, maybe someone could try.
