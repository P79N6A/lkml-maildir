Ah.  It does take a bit to get fib_trie into one's build -- allyesconfig
doesn't cut it.  Please accept my apologies for my confusion!!!
Once fib_trie is configured, I do indeed get:
    net/ipv4/fib_trie.c: In function ‘node_set_parent’:
    net/ipv4/fib_trie.c:182: warning: comparison between pointer and integer
So, given that node->parent is an unsigned long, I changed node_set_parent()
to the following:
static inline void node_set_parent(struct node *node, struct tnode *ptr)
{
	rcu_assign_index(node->parent, (unsigned long)ptr | NODE_TYPE(node));
}
This removes the warnings.  I am a little ambivalent about this, as
this is really a pointer in disguise rather than an array index, but
patch below.  I suppose that another option would be to make node->parent
be a void* and provide appropriate accessor functions/macros.
Thoughts?
