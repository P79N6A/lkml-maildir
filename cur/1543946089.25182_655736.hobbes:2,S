The patch "[RTNETLINK]: Send a single notification on device state changes." kills (at least) the keyboard here. Everything seems to work fine in single user mode, but when init starts spawning of logins, the keyboard goes bye-bye. Even the power button is ignored. :/
I've tried just creating another vt with "chvt 2", but that is insufficient to trigger the bug.
