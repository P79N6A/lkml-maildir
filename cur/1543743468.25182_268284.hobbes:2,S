I believe, based on the comment in class_simple.c:
  Any further sysfs files that might be required can be created using this pointer.
and the implementation in in drivers/scsi/st.c, that there's no
problem adding attributes to a device in a simple class.  You can just
use class_set_devdata() on your class_device to set whatever context
you need to get back to your internal structures, and then use
class_device_create_file() to add the attributes.
I assume this is OK (since there is already one in-kernel driver doing
it), but Greg, can you confirm that it's definitely OK for a driver to
use class_set_devdata() on a class_device from class_simple_device_add()?
Thanks,
  Roland
