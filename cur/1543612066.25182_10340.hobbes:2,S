While what I'm about to say has little bearing on the SMP/cc case:  one 
significant advantage of messages over spinlocks is being able to assign 
priority with low overhead in the quick-response real-time multi-CPU 
arena.  I worked with a cluster of up to 14 CPUs using something very much 
like NUMA in which task scheduling used a set of prioritized message 
queues.  The system I worked on was designed to break transaction-oriented 
tasks into a string of "work units" each of which could be processed very 
quickly -- on the order of three milliseconds or less.  (The limit of 14 
CPUs was set by the hardware used to implement the main system bus.)
I bring this up only because I have never seen a spinlock system that dealt 
with priority issues very well when under heavy load.
OK, I've said my piece, now I'll sit back and continue to watch your 
discussion.
