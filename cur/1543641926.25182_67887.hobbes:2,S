   x86-64 handles it (also in csum-copy). I think at least Alpha does it 
   too (that is where I stole the C csum-partial base from) But it's ugly.
   See the odd hack. 
Ok I think we really need to fix this then in the arches
where broken.  Let's do an audit. :-)
I question if x86 is broken at all.  It checks odd lengths
and x86 handles odd memory accesses transparently.  Please,
some x86 guru make some comments here :-)
It looks like sparc64 is the only platform where oddly aligned buffer
can truly cause problems and I can fix that easily enough.
