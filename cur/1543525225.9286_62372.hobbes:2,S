ROFL.
While it shouldn't go into the kernel (there are a few
legitimate cases where swapping to a ramdisk does make
sense), it certainly deserves to be (safely) enshrined
and worshipped ...
I guess it's time to create a patch of the month page
on my site and place it there.

 will be 404 for the next
few hours, but I promise I'll enshrine your patch so
future humanity can laugh at you(r patch) and buy you
beers :)
cheers,
Rik
