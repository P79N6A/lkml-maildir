Unless the FreeBSD bunch changed something recently, this is incorrect
usage. Specifically, lower partition numbers have very special
purposes. a is boot, b is swap, c is the whole disk, and d the reserved
FreeBSD portion (or c <-> d, possibly, as OpenBSD has done away with d).
`fdisk' gives you information about the physical disposition of the disk.

Notice that  c is correctly marked as `unused' there... It is not expected
that you use it directly. It is just the disk marker for FreeBSD to proceed.
You should use disklabel to add a proper partition  within c.

From the man page:
`newfs builds a file system on the specified special device, basing its
defaults on the information in the disk label'. So, newfs won't change
disklabel information. In the present case, it looks like it's giving
you too much rope to hang you, and that it should at least warn that
the partition you're formatting is `unused'.

That's perfectly natural, as you're trying to use a whole disk as a
partition. It's acting as it's supposed to do.

... which does not mean it is correct... 
Please do check your official FreeBSD documentation. I might be wrong and 
there might be evidence that what you say is correct on that system.
In such a case, we may wish to pass the partition type around to disable
partition checking for FreeBSD, but I can assure you that your ufs partition
usage looks quite bogus to me.

Write a correct partition table in the first place. Linux is noticing that
something is VERY amiss, which is good.  Where partitions are concerned,
it is much better to be a little bit conservative than mount a disk any
which way and overwrite sensitive information.

This is quite another problem, ask the Linux fdisk  maintainer
