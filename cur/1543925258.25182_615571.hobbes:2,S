Hi folks,
Here's a new spin of the clocksource implementation.
In this new version:
* followed avi's suggestion of:
  - letting the cpu itself register its memory area.
  - using a gfn instead of a phys addr as a parameter, to be sure we can 
    cover the whole memory area
  - write guest time at exits.
Also, I 'm not using an anonymous struct in the kvm_hv_clock union, so the
vcpu struct can grab just what it needs, and not the whole padding the guest needs
This is it.
Have fun
