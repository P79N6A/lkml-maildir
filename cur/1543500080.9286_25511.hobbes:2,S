The current linux versioning scheme is very clever. It underscores
the point that a software project never really completes. It only
evolves.
This strategy has served us very well in the past, but I do think
there is a need for a change. At present, the code evolves in 
two branches -- development (odd number) and stable (even number). 
I think we should at least split it into three branches -- 
development, beta, and stable. 
	Development --- kernel developers only
	Beta --- Adventorous users only
	Stable -- No serious bug reported in the past x days 
Of course, we get into the problem of not getting enough users to
pound on beta versions. But I think the number of linux users is large
enough that bug reporting will not be a problem.
Ultimately it may be that users have to judge for themselves.
But it would be nice if kernel developers can make the users
job easier.
