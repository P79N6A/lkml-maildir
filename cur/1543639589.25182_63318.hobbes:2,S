Or we could leave 0x40 fixed to 0x400 and use only 2.
This loses flexibility but anyway the only 2 apps that could use it are
dosemu and wine and I think that they already need to have it mapped at
0x400 for vm86 (no one uses 16-bit DLLs anymore).
Of course this is only valid if Win32 doesn't use it because otherwise
we would lose the ability to do null-pointer checking in programs using
Win32 DLLs (e.g. mplayer).
