Reuben,
The "duplicate const" compile warning you mention seems to be a minor
problem with the min/max macros.
The fix for the 64 bit warnings for the cifs vfs are not going to affect
the duplicate const minor warning caused by the min/max macro.  This
warning does not show up on my i386 2.5.41 builds.
