Subject: Need some help with conf.modules and two soundmodules.

I have looked at the sound-howto, the kernel Documentation directory and
manpages, but can't figure out this one.
I have two sound devices (PAS-16 16-bit and the 8-bit sb emulator on the same 
card)
This works when compiled into the kernel.
Modules work to the extent that I can load and unload them at will, and
/dev/dsp connects to the pas2.o module for 16-bit sound.
The problem seems to be making /dev/dsp1 connect to the sb.o module also.
/etc/conf.modules has all the parameters (irq's and so on) for
both pas2.o and sb.o 
It also has alias char-major-14 pas2.o I believe this is how the kernel
knows that sound is supposed to be handled by the pas-16 driver instead
of some other module.
So I wonder what do I need to put in conf.modules so it will
understand that /dev/dsp1 should be handled by the sb module?
/dev/dsp1 use the major-14 number too, although with a different minor number.
An attempt to use "alias char-major-14-minor-19 sb" didn't do the trick, and
I couldn't find any detailed docs for conf.modules aliases. 
Do anybody know how to do this, or is it documented somewhere?
