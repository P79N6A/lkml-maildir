Yes, I know! But hopefully this security implication is not so
important for people who just want to test new database on their
workstations (like me), or even install it on the production database
server where you mostly don't see any other shell user beside the
administrator of the machine.
But yes, you're right, we need to warn people.
DON'T use the patch if you have untrusty shell users on your machine!!!

P.S. Although, if superuser properly limits the number of hugepages
     that can be allocated (echo "valid nr of pages" > nr_hugepages)
     what does attacker do to consume more pages than that? Just
     curious...
