I have encountered problems with that patch. If the mouse is sending events 
while the delay timeout is being reached X11 reports spurious mouse events. 
I.e. you are moving the mouse continuously after hitting a key. My mouse 
often jumps to the right upper corner of the screen and reports some clicks 
there.
Mouse events consist of sequences of 3-4 bytes (normal PS/2 mouses 3 bytes, 
wheel mouses 4 bytes) see
  
http://panda.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/
%7Eachapwes/PICmicro/mouse/mouse.html
But with the original patch the first accepted bytes after the timeout can be 
out of that order. So, X11 reads the 2nd or 3rd byte of the actual mouse 
movement as 1st byte.
The patch below implements 2 solutions for the problem:
1. If TRACKPAD_RESET_IF_ACTIVITY_DURING_DELAY is defined it sends a RESET 
command to the mouse after the timeout if there were mouse events during the 
delay interval.
2. If TRACKPAD_RESET_IF_ACTIVITY_DURING_DELAY is not defined it skips chunks 
of 3*4=12 bytes of mouse input.
I am not certain what the "right" solution is. Case 2 is the better one in my 
opinion because after a RESET even a wheel mouse will be in "normal" mode 
sending 3 bytes per event. Further case 2 seems to be more responsive.
