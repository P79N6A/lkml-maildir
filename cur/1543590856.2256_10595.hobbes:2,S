There _were_ some viruses (in M$ world) that added "expensive" operations
to every disk access, such as reading from the extreme ends of the disk,
so that the head of the hard disk might eventually fail.
Also, I have heard a hum coming out of a slightly old monitor (optiplex)
when set to run X with high resolutions (well above horizontal/vertical
frequency limits). This monior eventually failed when operating in the
_safe_ regime. However, I suspect that this was a problem with the monitor
rather than software.
