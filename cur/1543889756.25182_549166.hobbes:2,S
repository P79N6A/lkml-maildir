So returns -EOPNOTSUPP to any barrier request?

So we do a test I/O to see if the device supports them before
enabling that mode.  But, as we've recently discovered, this is not
sufficient to detect *correctly functioning* barrier support.

I don't buy that argument.....

At this point, the filesystem has done everything it needs to ensure
that the block layer has been informed of the I/O ordering
requirements. Why should the filesystem now have to detect block
layer breakage, and then use a different block layer API to issue
the same I/O under the same constraints?

That's a very linear, single-threaded way of looking at it... ;)

That's right, except for the "g" (or "c") bit - commit writes are
async and nothing waits for them - the io completion wakes anything
waiting on it's completion....
(yes, all XFS barrier I/Os are issued async which is why having to
handle an -EOPNOTSUPP error is a real pain. The fix I currently
have is to reissue the I/O from the completion handler with is
ugly, ugly, ugly.....)

Right - XFS as it stands was designed to work on SAFE devices, and
we've modified it to work on BARRIER devices. We don't support
FLUSHABLE devices at all.
But if the filesystem supports BARRIER devices, I don't see any
reason why a filesystem needs to be modified to support FLUSHABLE
devices - the key point being that by the time the filesystem
has issued the "commit write" it has already waited for all it's
dependent I/O, and so all the block device needs to do is
issue flushes either side of the commit write....

A count of outstanding I/Os and a wait queue is sufficient to implement
this, I think.

So you want to define these as a FLUSHABLE device?

In case you hadn't already guess, I don't like this behaviour at
all.  It makes async I/O completion of barrier I/O an ugly, messy
business, and every place you do sync I/O completion you need to put
special error handling.
If this happens to md/raid1, then why can't it simply do a
blkdev_issue_flush, write, blkdev_issue_flush sequence to the device
that doesn't support barriers and then the md device *never changes
behaviour*. Next time the filesystem is mounted, it will turn off
barriers because they won't be supported....
You do that, and suddenly there's 10 filesystems that no longer have
to handle this extremely rare corner case.

Mostly valid ;)
I like the idea of clearly defining the different types of devices
so we can say exactly what each device behaves like. It also
points out (to me, anyway) that from a filesystem POV there is
no logical difference between a BARRIER and a FLUSHABLE block device;
the only difference is that filesystems are forced to use a
different API to support them (and hence they are not supported).

Alternate viewpoint - should the block layer be fixed so that the
filesystems only need to use one barrier API that provides static
behaviour for the life of the mount?

Dave.
