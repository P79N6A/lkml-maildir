Hi,
I encountered some problems with the tg3 network device driver in the
2.6 kernel series, namely problems when using the device for nfs.
For further description, see
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=240812
I checked it with the 2.6.5-rc3 kernel, and the issue is still present.
Please tell me how I can help debugging this further.
Thanks for considering.
bye,
  Roland
