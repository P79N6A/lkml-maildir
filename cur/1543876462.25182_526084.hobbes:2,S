__get_free_pages(..., __GFP_DMA32) on 64bit or __GFP_KERNEL or i386
(only gives you ~900MB)

Not sure what you mean? __alloc_pages never bounces by itself.
The nearest you can get is __GFP_DMA/__GFP_DMA32, but these have
their own 16MB/4GB zones and don't use the swiotlb pools. And of course it
only gives you plain memory, but doesn't remap or copy anything.
I have some plans to unify this with swiotlb, but they're not done.
