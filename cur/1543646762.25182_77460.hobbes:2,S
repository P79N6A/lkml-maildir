thanks for the patch. i've been out having baby #2 but back on
email now. 
i have not been up on recent 2.5.x mods but the modification
looks simple and other audio drivers have the same modifications.
applying the fix to the 2.5.41(?) tree seems safe. i'll send your
patch to the 2.5.x audio responsible person, but not sure whom it
is? (i don't *think* it's alan).  also the cs46xx driver will
need the same mod which i'll create and send this week.
