I assume you mean AVC messages ? They indicate something that should be
fixed in selinux policy (or that your filesystem is incorrectly labelled
-- such as if you've booted with selinux=0 at any point).
They can also get filtered with the audit subsystem to /var/log/audit/, never
hitting the dmesg ringbuffer.
