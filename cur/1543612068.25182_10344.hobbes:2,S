Hi,
the problem is that kapm-idled and the idle task are both trying to handle the
system idle time. I did send a patch correcting this weird behaviour for
revision to Alan Cox a few days ago but until now there's no reaction from him.
Oh, and there's more problems with kapm-idled. Think of a task like kmix that
is ready to run every fraction of HZ to do some bookkeeping. Now look at the
kapm-idled code. If both run in sync, e.g. they are ready to run during the
same time slice kapm-idled will never do bios idle calls as there's always at
least one task ready to run and this is then accounted as a 'heavily loaded
system'.
If you want to have a look at the patch please let me know though it may take a
few days. I have to recover a system suffering from severe bit errors due to
a memory module having gone south very slowly and quiet.
