Some possiblities:
	2.6.8 still had the broken TCP segmentation offload that didn't obey
	congestion/slow start.  Are you using hardware that supports TSO?
	Does 2.6.8 behaviour change if you turn TSO off with ethtool?
	Is there window scaling or other issues?  Does 2.6.10 get faster if
	you turn of window scaling sys.net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=0?
	Is there a window scale corrupting firewall (like OpenBSD pf)
	in the way?
	Is there more packet loss on the router or the Mac?
