Subject: 2.6.3-rc vs 2.6.2: new problem at boot?

I'm sorry if this were reported already, but I think this might have
been overlooked, and is important for upcoming 2.6.3.
I'm booting 2.6.2 fine, but with the exact same .config file,
2.6.3-rc1/2 finds no volume groups during initrd execution.
/boot is on /dev/hda1:reiserfs, everything else is on /dev/hda2:LVM.
Before I add debug stuff to initrd, was there a voluntary change
somewhere between 2.6.2 and 2.6.3-rc1 that can trigger this ?
Thanks
Joël
