Changes in the October LTP release:
LTP-20041007
- Applied fix from patch 1037010, submitted by mator.
- Changes from Kris Wilson on RH specific changes
- Changes from the security team testcases
- Add HOWTO for pci tests
- Changes for pci testcases
- Disable -std=c99 and -peandtic flags in writetest's Makefile.  Some users
of very old gcc versions
  had problems with this, but it looks like those versions of gcc will
still compile it ok.
- Fix typo and add log statement if a failure on loading the test module
- Changes requested from the security team for fix PPC64 error
- Small fix to chown03 and fchown04.  tst_tmpdir() call was happening in a
spot that would cause
  it to break under certain automation environments.
- un-spamify fork11 test
- Fix getrlimit02.  Rajeev Tiwari <rajeevti@in.ibm.com> pointed out that
RLIMIT_NLIMIT was now too
  low in the usr include files for newer kernels to cause this to fail.
Defined a new high one that
  ought to work for the forseeable future.
- Overhaul madvise02.  Removed some invalid testcases, fixed one case that
was an invalid failure, and a lot of cleanup
- Changes from SuSE for mincore tests
- Changes from Ihno for Itainium failures
- Changes from SuSE for setdomainname tests
- Changes submitted from SuSE for sethostname
- Changes to fix statfs03 error on trying to write to protected directory
- Change to fix defect 10947, failure on tmp directory
- Applied IA64 specific patch from Jacky Malcles:
