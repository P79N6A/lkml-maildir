If that's the case, CONFIG_NFSD_SUN is implemented incorrectly. A
directory should have the same fsid and fileid whether or not it is
used as a mount point. That is, knfsd should be exporting _covered_
directory, not the covering directory, to guarantee no inode aliasing.
This does not appear to be the case at the moment. To behave like
Sun's nfsd, nfsd_lookup needs to pass an option to lookup_dentry to
get it not to call follow_mount.
