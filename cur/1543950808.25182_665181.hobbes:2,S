LLDs which loop over sg's trying to complete rq incrementally will see
rq going away sooner than it expected.

Actually the other way, block layer use sg instead of bio_vec in bio.
Layer separation doesn't necessarily require copying about the same
information to differently formatted data structure.  I'm not sure it
will be a clean win tho.  Requests hang longer in scheduler queue and
and bio_vec is smaller and scatterlist.
The thing is that, to me, blk_rq_map_sg() doesn't really look necessary,
it can be done just as well when the request is fetched from the queue
by block driver. (continued below...)

And, so, I'm not too sure whether putting more mechanisms into it is a
good idea.
Thanks.
