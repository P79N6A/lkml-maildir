Yes, that would be quite redundant now, new patch attached.

a) kobj_lookup() vs kobj_(un)map() use the domain lock.
Not all calls to blk_register_region() were under lock_kernel() afaicf.
So I don't think this is needed, but I'll gladly take advise otherwise,
I'm not well versed with the kobj stuff.
b) from quick inspection yesterday I reached two (false) conclusions
 - &part would not be changed when !disk
 - disk would have to exists at the time we call bdget()
Now I can't seem to validate either of them. Added disk to the if
statement just to be safe.

Hmm, yes I think I see what you mean...
