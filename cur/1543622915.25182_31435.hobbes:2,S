The version of e1000 that Jeff merged in has no hardware VLAN capabilities
right now, the version distributed from Intel's web site has hooks for the
binary only iANS teaming/VLAN product.
That being said, I will add support to e1000 for a standard kernel interface
(e100 too, but there are other things to fix first).  David's interface
looks very nice to me, especially in it's clear advertisement of
capabilities and simple transmit and receive design.  Intel's hardware will
have no problem working with it.
I did have some questions about the entry points.
Is vlan_rx_kill_vid only there to ensure locking between vlan_hwaccel_rx and
unregister_802_1Q_vlan_dev?  If so, could this be handled outside of the
driver?
Also, when a vlan dev is unregistered, does the driver need to know that the
vlan_group passed in to vlan_rx_register is no longer valid?
