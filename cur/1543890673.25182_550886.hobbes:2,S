See 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8472.
A more general solution is to disable MSI for the VIA VT3351 (used by
the Asus M2V).  I attempted to do this in the -stable tree with
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/26/167,
 but it was shot down because the
patch isn't upstream yet.
Unfortunately, I can't submit it upstream because the enabling
patch hasn't yet been applied upstream by the PCI maintainer. My
request for info on the status of the patch went unanswered.
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/19/74
The enabling patch was submitted by Tejun Heo 9 May.
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/9/213
It was applied to -stable (2.6.21.2) 23 May.
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/23/385
It has not yet been applied upstream.  When it is, I'll push the atl1
MSI patch.
