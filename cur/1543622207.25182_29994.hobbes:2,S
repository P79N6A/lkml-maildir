Hi Steffan,
On early IA64 long long was assumed to be 64 bit, long 32 bit. After
emailing some folks off line I relaize this may not be the case 
any longer, but still is on some compiler options.
Say hi to Hugo for me next time you see him.  :-)  I have reviewed this
and we will need some changes to the page table setup in Linux 
and copy to/from user macros in order to get around this problem 
for preallocating prefetch space. 
Any ideas and joint work on this problem is appreciated.    
Jeff
