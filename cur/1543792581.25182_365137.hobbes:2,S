	Ok, the OCFS2 git trees have the latest code, including the
AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE patch, the OCFS2 locking changes, and the removal of
the typedefs.  Let us know if you see anything else.
	Andrew, the AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE patch is also broken out at
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2/dist/files/patches/2.6.14/2005-11-08/broken-out/linux-2.6.14-aop-truncated-page-1.patch.
If you pull it via the OCFS2 git tree, you'll still need
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2/dist/files/patches/2.6.14/2005-11-08/broken-out/linux-2.6.14-mm1-aop-truncated-page-reiser4.patch
for reiser4.
	Thanks everyone for the comments and the help.
Joel
