Subject: 2.4.1 swaps hardware addresses for ethernet cards

I have 2 ether cards 59x (eth0) and 509 (eth1). I have been adding 509
at boot in lilo.conf. Using this same config in 2.4.1 results in 
the hardware addresses for the cards to be swapped. If I remove 509 from 
Lilo I get the same result. Suggestions would be appreciated
