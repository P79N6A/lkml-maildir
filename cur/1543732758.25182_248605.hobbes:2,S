When can we expect patches?

Putting everything (including web server and browser) in the kernel is
not a good (or even desireable) target - perhaps that's the reason for
Win* to be where there are.
And it *is* done in user-space (ok, there more than one apprach and
implementation but this may change. And you want to invent the next
version.).

Which is probably an argument against such features. How long do ACLs
exist - as well as standard and in implementation?
How many people and/or apps are using it?
No more questions.

It is not in the interest of MSFT that their aplication's files are
viewable on other OSes. Expect incompatible changes to formats, streams
and metadata contents (and surely patents on them - even if the idea is
not new) if it starts to be really useful. It happended already in the
past with the SMB protocol IIRC ....
