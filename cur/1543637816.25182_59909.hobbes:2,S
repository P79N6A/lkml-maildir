Hi Kurt,
one little thing:
In the third "if" statement in scsiname_to_kdev_t you search for "scd" but
set tp to "sr".
That should also be "scd" I'd guess.
Cheers,
Aron
Hi Marcelo,
here comes patch 3/5 from a series of patches to support more than 128 (and
optionally more than 256) SCSI disks with Linux 2.4 by changing the sd
driver
to dynamically allocate memory and register block majors as disks get
attached.
The patches are all available at
http://www.suse.de/~garloff/linux/scsi-many/
Patch 3 does use the infrastructure of patch 1 to allow specifying the
root filesystem as a kernel parameter using devfs syntax (e.g.
root=/dev/scsi/c2b0t9u0p5), but also working on non-devfs systems.
Together with the (already existing) scsihosts= parameter, this can
be quite useful if you have many SCSI disks with changing configurations.
This patch is against 2.4.19rc1. It depends on 1/3.
Regards,
