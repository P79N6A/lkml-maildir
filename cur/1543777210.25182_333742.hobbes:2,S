Hi !
I recently had to boot a brand new system using a Marvel Yukon2 NIC (sk98lin) 
driver which is not supported by the latest kernel (pci ids = 11ab:4361).
So I compiled the GPLed driver available from Syskonnect, 
http://www.syskonnect.com/syskonnect/support/driver/d0102_driver.html,
 which 
works perfectly.
So, I wonder why the sk98lin driver is not up to date in the 2.6.x kernels ?
Cheers,
