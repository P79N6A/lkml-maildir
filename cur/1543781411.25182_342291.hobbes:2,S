Ok, very nice. Finally some actual code review, thanks. :-)

These are all just standard CMOS port numbers that pretty much every
chipset uses to access CMOS.
If you have not got a PE1300, the worst that happens is you have some
random bits scribbled into your CMOS. Nothing that that "cmos clear"
jumper won't fix. :-)
Seriously, this file is meant to be activated by a userspace program
that looks up the system ID in the appropriate table and writes the
correct value into the driver. I'm not sure there is much more to be
said than "don't do that." The official Dell management stack will
always ensure that this is set correctly. If you don't use the official
Dell stack, libsmbios is available, and we would be happy to make the
appropriate tables available there. If you don't use either of these and
go fiddling with this, I'm not sure there is much more to be done.

I'll have to defer to Doug on this. It may be possible to arrange this.
