these are still there..

you don't seem to have updated the common code for this yet.

More comments:
 - what protects accessing d_parent in lock_parent / unlock_parent?
 - no need to cast the return value of kmem_cache_alloc, it's void *
 - any reason to use the SLAB_* flags instead of GFP_?  I'm a bit surprised
   SLAB_* still exists at all..
 - follow_link handling is wrong.  you need to call the underlying
   ->follow_link in your follow_link implementation and you need to keep
   a separate nameidata for it
 - please kill that ugly ecryptfs_allocated_caches hack and do normal
   goto based unwinding on failure
 - using iget with the lower filesystems i_ino does not work.  There are
   various filesystems were i_ino does not uniqueuely identify an inode.
   You will probably need your own sequence numbers.  Also please don't
   use iget in new code but always the iget_locked variant.
And a more general issue with implementing stackable filesystems:
  I think it's probably much better to not stack ontop of a part of the
  existing namespace but rather let ecryptfs mount the underlying filesystem
  internally using vfs_kern_mount.  This gets out of the way of possible
  lock order problems when doing namespace operation involving both the
  stacked and underlying filesystem aswell as allowing using a stackable
  filesystem as the root filesystem.
