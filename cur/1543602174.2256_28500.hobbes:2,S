2.4.10 seems to behave worse than kernels up to 2.4.9 and 2.4.9ac12
(haven't tried above) with the following workload (everything is only a
subjective impression as a user; I don't look at how long the "rm" and the
"tar" take because that's not very important for me):
FVWM with 6 open xterms is running
XMMS is running
mv linux linux.old
nice rm -rf linux.old &
tar xzf linux-2.4.10.tar.gz &
lynx 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/testing
up to 2.4.9 and 2.4.9ac12:
everything works fine
2.4.10:
interactive use of the machine is very bad, I can't type a command in
another xterm
2.4.10 + 00_vm-tweaks-1:
interactive use of the machine works all right, but XMMS does sometimes
stutter
This is on a K6 with 300 Mhz. free in 2.4.10 + 00_vm-tweaks-1 gives the
following output:
$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         62252      60400       1852          0       2408      32792
-/+ buffers/cache:      25200      37052
Swap:       947824      10264     937560
$
My impression is that there's a problem when several processes do heavy
non-cachable disk IO.
