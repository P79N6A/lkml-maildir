The contention i saw was on mainline and in the pagecache uses of 
kmap(). With HIGHPTE i only meant that typically every available highmem 
option is enabled on 32-bit distro kernel rpms, to make it work on as 
wide selection of hardware as possible. Sometimes PAE is split into a 
separate rpm, but mostly there's just one 32-bit kernel.
