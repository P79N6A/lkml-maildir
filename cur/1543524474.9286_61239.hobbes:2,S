Hiho developers,
 I discovered 2 problems with 2.3.42:
 1) When I compile it for a K6 maschine the kernel hangs after "Loading ..."
    It's probably a compiler problem, maybe using -march=k6 is no good idea.
 2) Using a Pentium version of the kernel works until short before the prompt.
    He starts up normally even loads all my daemons and servers and shows me
    my login shell, after authentificating myself the mschine just does nothing.
    I can logon on all tty's but'll never get a shell; he seems o hangs, however 
    I can break this by pressing Ctrl-C and get back my login prompt.
