Hi,
I'm trying to capture IP packets over a Token Ring network through a
(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW) socket, but for some
reason the sll_protocol field in the sockaddr_ll structure doesn't
contain ETH_P_IP for IP packets but rather contains 0x100 (of course, in
network byte order).
Is this a bug, or is it expected behavior?
