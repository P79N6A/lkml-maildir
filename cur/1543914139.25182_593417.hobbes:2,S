Ehrm, yeah, I somehow parsed that as if it had a negation in there.
Anyway, I looked up the patches you posted. "when" is initialized to 0
and only changed if the above condition evaluates to true. Now,
time_after and "<" have different points at which "future" and "past"
are separated. time_after splits (about) equally between future and
past, so 0 can be either, depending on the value of jiffies. But for "<"
0 is almost always in the past, except for the seldom event of jiffies
being 0.
Now, given that jiffies start out at a huge value to make the counter
wrap around early, 0 happens to be in the "future" for time_after, until
the wrap around occurs. So in your case, you just might have to wait
those 5 minutes to get the working behaviour, instead of the common case
in which it breaks after that time ;-)
A fix would likely initialize "when" to jiffies.
