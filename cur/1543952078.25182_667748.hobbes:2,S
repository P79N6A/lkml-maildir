Probably simpler to just have variants of the page_set_* functions which 
simulate the worst-possible host action immediately (ie, stealing pages, 
logically swapping them, etc).  That wouldn't give you full coverage, 
but it would go some way.  An async variant which schedules a change in 
a few milliseconds would help too.
I guess that's equivalent to having a special-purpose hypervisor built 
into the kernel (hm, sounds familiar...).
