Hmm, I had issues with my mail server so I just received this. I was 
porting it to x86-64 last night too.

I fixed this in my last patch queue.

I'm hitting some crashes but it does not seem to be related to this.
I'm still investigating, but it looks like it is due to some strange race
because I can run for hours sometimes and other times it crashes right
away.

Agree, this is really awesome. I'm also working on a way to trigger 
specific functions to trace instead of tracing all functions.
