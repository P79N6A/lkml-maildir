AT&T has a source license to an older version of NT, as they were
(or maybe still are) suing Microsoft for access to source for
newer versions.  So it's not inconceivable that Thompson has seen 
NT source code.
Considering that Thompson has worked on OSes that were developed
by fairly small and well-coordinated groups of people (UNIX with
Dennis Ritchie, Plan 9 with Rob Pike et al) his perception that
Linux looks a bit fragmented and chaotic makes some sense.  That
he considers Linux to be purely a backlash against Microsoft does 
seem to indicate he doesn't really know much about the history of 
Linux, though.
