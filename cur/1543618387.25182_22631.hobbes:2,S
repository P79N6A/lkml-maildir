Hi!
Two serious bugs fixed:
* corruption when not doing resume
* signal fixes (they were killing init)
It is *still* only supported with old hd driver. People were running
it with newer driver, but possibly bad things could happen. Do not use
*any* drivers doing DMA around suspend.
Please try, and report success ;-)))),
