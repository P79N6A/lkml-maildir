Yes it does. Maybe the people who spend a lot of time debugging these
don't feel the pain anymore.

We already use -Os if you set the right config (but this change was actually 
long before that)
It's possible that -Os includes -fno-block-reordering though.

AFAIK gcc mostly uses the probability information for block reordering
to make the fast path fall through without jumps.
There are some more uses, but they don't impact the code very much.
