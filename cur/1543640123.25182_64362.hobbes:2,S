Right, I'll just go get my oscilloscope now...
In fact I relied on the technique you mentioned a great deal when
I was doing realtime work with PCs.  With a multi-trace digital
scope the effect is something like a poor-man's logic analyser
with a resolution of 10 us or so.
Another technique I can recommend highly is panicking by halting
in a tight loop with the speaker set to emit some tone.  It may
be annoying for the guy at the next bench but in some code, such
as transitioning to/from virtual86 mode, there aren't a lot of
alternatives.
