This approach may fail:
a. Some pre-barrier writes go to all devices
b. barrier is sent to all devices
c. Post-barrier writes go to all devices
d. drive 1 commits all its pre-barrier writes, then
   commits its post-barrier writes.
e. drive 2 is slow and havent done the pre-barrier writes yet
f. power is lost - leaving inconsistent devices.
The problem is that drive 1 don't know wether drive 2
did the barrier yet.
