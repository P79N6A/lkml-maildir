Ah yes.  It needed to be authoritative.  I did recall incorrectly.
I suspect some would argue that you are right that LSM is broken, but
only because it wasn't allowed to be authoritative.  Of course that
was to increase chances of LSM upstream inclusion.  Sorry Casey and
Linda, I bet that just makes it sting all the harder if LSM is now
removed for not being sufficiently useful.
