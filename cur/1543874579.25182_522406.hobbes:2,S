Subject: [PATCH] SLAB : Use num_possible_cpus() in enable_cpucache()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The existing comment in mm/slab.c is *perfect*, so I reproduce it :
         /*
          * CPU bound tasks (e.g. network routing) can exhibit cpu bound
          * allocation behaviour: Most allocs on one cpu, most free operations
          * on another cpu. For these cases, an efficient object passing between
          * cpus is necessary. This is provided by a shared array. The array
          * replaces Bonwick's magazine layer.
          * On uniprocessor, it's functionally equivalent (but less efficient)
          * to a larger limit. Thus disabled by default.
          */
As most shiped linux kernels are now compiled with CONFIG_SMP, there is no way 
a preprocessor #if can detect if the machine is UP or SMP. Better to use 
num_possible_cpus().
This means on UP we allocate a 'size=0 shared array', to be more efficient.
Another patch can later avoid the allocations of 'empty shared arrays', to 
save some memory.
