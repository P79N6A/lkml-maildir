Subject: [PATCH] IRQ: prevent enabling of previously disabled interrupt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
   This fix prevents re-disabling and enabling of a previously disabled 
interrupt in 2.6.16-rc5.  On an SMP system with irq balancing enabled; 
If an interrupt is disabled from within its own interrupt context with 
disable_irq_nosync and is also earmarked for processor migration, the 
interrupt is blindly moved to the other processor and enabled without 
regard for its current "enabled" state.  If there is an interrupt  
pending, it will unexpectedly invoke the irq handler on the new irq 
owning processor (even though the irq was previously disabled)
   The more intuitive fix would be to invoke disable_irq_nosync and 
enable_irq, but since we already have the desc->lock from __do_IRQ, we 
cannot call them directly.  Instead we can use the same logic to 
disable and enable found in disable_irq_nosync and enable_irq, with 
regards to the desc->depth.
   This now prevents a disabled interrupt from being re-disabled, and 
more importantly prevents a disabled interrupt from being incorrectly 
enabled on a different processor.
