In which case, can we change the following in IO-mapping.txt please?
        /*
         * remap framebuffer PCI memory area at 0xFC000000,
         * size 1MB, so that we can access it: We can directly
         * access only the 640k-1MB area, so anything else
         * has to be remapped.
         */
        char * baseptr = ioremap(0xFC000000, 1024*1024);
since its not true?  (since 0xfc000000 is a cookie).
