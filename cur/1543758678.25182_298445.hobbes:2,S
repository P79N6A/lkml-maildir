Many thanks also from me!

Well, at least we would have a reason ;)

Anyway, glibc already seems to have a condition for that, so IMHO glibc also 
could truncate the inode numbers if needed. And finally glibc probably knows 
best if its compiled as 32bit or 64bit. Will take a look into the glibc 
sources.
Many, many thanks to all for their help!
