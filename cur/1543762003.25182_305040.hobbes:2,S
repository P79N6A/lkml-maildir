Put an rcu_read_depth on each task. In rcu_read_lock() make a 
 current->rcu_read_depth++;
and visa versa in rcu_read_unlock(). In can_migrate_task() add
   if(p->rcu_read_depth)
         return 0;
That might do the trick.

I barely have time to download at the patches - let alone applying them!
Anyway: I find one thing I don't like: using atomic_inc()/dec() in
rcu_read_lock()/unlock() to touch rcu_data which might be on another
CPU. Then rcu_data is not really per-CPU data anymore and it also hurts
performance of RCU readers.
I think it will be cheaper to use the above rcu_read_depth and then either
not migrate tasks at all or make the migrate code take care of migrating
the rcu_read_depth count to the new CPU - one would have to take care to
increment it in the rcu_data of the new CPU on the new CPU (it isn't
atomic) and then decrement it in the rcu_data of the old CPU on the old
CPU - in that order.
