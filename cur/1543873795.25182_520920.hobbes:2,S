Subject: [PATCH] UML - arch_prctl should set thread fs

[ This missed getting into -stable the first time I sent it ]
In my previous x86_64 thread fix, I forgot to initialize
thread.arch.fs in arch_prctl.  A process calling arch_prctl to set %fs
would lose it on the next context switch.
It also turns out that you can switch to a process which is in the
process of exiting and which has lost its mm.  In this case, it's
worse than useless to try to call arch_prctl on the host process.
