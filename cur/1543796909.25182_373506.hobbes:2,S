Since the discussion came up again in irc, I looked up the existing file
systems.
outside of fs/, we have the following file systems.
find -name \*.c | grep -v ^./fs | xargs grep struct.file_system_type.*=
./arch/ia64/kernel/perfmon.c:static struct file_system_type pfm_fs_type = {
./drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_main.c:static struct file_system_type uverbs_event_fs = {
./drivers/isdn/capi/capifs.c:static struct file_system_type capifs_fs_type = {
./drivers/misc/ibmasm/ibmasmfs.c:static struct file_system_type ibmasmfs_type = {
./drivers/oprofile/oprofilefs.c:static struct file_system_type oprofilefs_type = {
./drivers/usb/core/inode.c:static struct file_system_type usb_fs_type = {
./drivers/usb/gadget/inode.c:static struct file_system_type gadgetfs_type = {
./ipc/mqueue.c:static struct file_system_type mqueue_fs_type = {
./kernel/cpuset.c:static struct file_system_type cpuset_fs_type = {
./kernel/futex.c:static struct file_system_type futex_fs_type = {
./mm/shmem.c:static struct file_system_type tmpfs_fs_type = {
./mm/tiny-shmem.c:static struct file_system_type tmpfs_fs_type = {
./net/socket.c:static struct file_system_type sock_fs_type = {
./net/sunrpc/rpc_pipe.c:static struct file_system_type rpc_pipe_fs_type = {
./security/inode.c:static struct file_system_type fs_type = {
./security/selinux/selinuxfs.c:static struct file_system_type sel_fs_type = {
In fs/, most code deals with actual files stored on a disk or similar,
with the exception of:
./fs/binfmt_misc.c:static struct file_system_type bm_fs_type = {
./fs/block_dev.c:static struct file_system_type bd_type = {
./fs/debugfs/inode.c:static struct file_system_type debug_fs_type = {
./fs/devfs/base.c:static struct file_system_type devfs_fs_type = {
./fs/devpts/inode.c:static struct file_system_type devpts_fs_type = {
./fs/eventpoll.c:static struct file_system_type eventpoll_fs_type = {
./fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:static struct file_system_type hugetlbfs_fs_type = {
./fs/inotify.c:static struct file_system_type inotify_fs_type = {
./fs/openpromfs/inode.c:static struct file_system_type openprom_fs_type = {
./fs/pipe.c:static struct file_system_type pipe_fs_type = {
./fs/proc/root.c:static struct file_system_type proc_fs_type = {
./fs/relayfs/inode.c:static struct file_system_type relayfs_fs_type = {
./fs/sysfs/mount.c:static struct file_system_type sysfs_fs_type = {
I guess there is no strict rule where these file systems go to, e.g.
hugetlbs could just as well live near mm/shmem.c or any of those outside
of fs/ could be moved in there.
I don't really care where I put spufs, but I would prefer to move
the files only one more time at most.
Initially, they were in fs/spufs, and I moved them to
arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs at Pekkas suggestion.
