Hi.
I have a dual P3 box with 2Gigs RAM booting off onboard scsi, and I am 
having problems getting the latest v2.4.19 kernel to support the hardware 
fully. I can compile the kernel to fully support the hardware if I do not 
have it configured for 4G support, in which case it only sees 900Megs or so 
of RAM, but everything works and boots properly.
When I config for 4Gig however, the system fails to boot, giving a bunch of 
errors like the following:
/lib/ext3.0: unresolved symbol highmem_start_page
/lib/ext3.0: unresolved symbol journal_blocks_per_page_Rsmp_6082191c
/lib/ext3.0: unresolved symbol kmap_high
/lib/ext3.0: unresolved symbol journal_forget_Rsmp_678417a8
...
ERROR: /bin/insmod exited abnormally
Any idea how I can get this working properly.
