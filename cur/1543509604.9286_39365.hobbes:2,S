Hi,
When you have turned-on "/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/log_martians"
The messages get both in the syslog
_AND_
they bleed through on the current console, that is a bug no?!
Note:
I have no cfg setup in syslog.conf to put "kern.*" msg's on 
"/dev/console"...
I have however setup for everybody to receive "*.emerg" but this is hardly
a system EMERGENCY I think...
Also I think it would be good if those changes that one makes in the
"..../all/" tree would be reflected in the normal tree under "..../conf/"
because as of now it ain't so...
As for the meantime I've disabled "log_martians" ;-((
No need to reply, as I'm NOT on the list AND this adress is...[guess ;-)]
TTYL.
