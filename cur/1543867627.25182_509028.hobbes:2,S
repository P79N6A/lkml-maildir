No, it will become less attractive to those who are so paranoid about thier own
percieved inteleectual property that they can't see the value add of sharing
their source code with the community.  Take a look at digium (to name just one
company off the top of my head).  how much has sharing their source code drivers
for their FSX/FSO cards helped them out?  The embedded people who get the model
understand what contributing buys them.  Those who don't get it, aren't of a
concern to the community, and they'll be stuck paying royalties to Wind River /
OSE / etc. .  Take your pick.

You're right.  Not everyone has to be a contributor, people can be users and not
contribute anything.  About the only thing you cannot do is develop for linux
without contributing source, and whine about it when the development model
doesn't go your way.  What exactly did you expect here?
