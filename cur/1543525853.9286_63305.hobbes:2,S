Unless you guys want to cough up some hardware to start this diddy, I
think we have as special as intel smp gets. HAR!
So you are thinking that the bootstrap code should analyze the system as
compared to having the first sibling do it? Ok...

That would have to happen to make this worthwhile. It (IMVHO) this only
makes sense to do this if it can be implemented on fairly common
hardware. You guys over at SGI build awesome stuff, but the average guy
can't afford the SMP stuff available (without re-mortgageing the
house). The protocol will have to allow for sharing so that the less well
endowed machines can use this. 
After pouring over what I could find of the mp spec for intel('cause thats
what I have to work with) I discovered that both FreeBSD and Linux use the
"Virtual-wire" mode for the APIC under smp. This means that only the BSP
handles irq's! Seems like that is done to keep the code down, but I am not
an OS engineer. I could find little about the "symmetric-mode" that is
also available and only a description that states that 'each processor can
handle ANY interrupt." This sound like it is more useful in our
circumstance? I think it could lead to the need to 'pass' interrupts from
processor to processor, but allow for all processors to use the same
hardware more effectivly.

Not sure... help on this one? We may not have that option on the Intel
stuff, I wonder how the ALPHA's do it...

Some kind of master table that is copied from sibling to sibling at
initial booting and gives the hard memory layout of each sibling. In proc?

Unix is best described as an old, sturdy tree.
Well built, always growing, and has stood the test of time.
