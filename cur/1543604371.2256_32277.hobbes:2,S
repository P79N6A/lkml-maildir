In Linus kernels 2.4.11+ the block devices and filesystems all use the
page cache, so no more coherency issues.
Also, I don't think this ever had the potential to corrupt the filesystem,
but maybe make a slightly bad backup.

Yes, but the only issue is if the filesystem is busy, you may get
a bad backup for those files that have changed, but not for any files
that have not changed during the backup.
Reasons for not using tar or cpio include atime change and the fact
that an "incremental" tar can't record the deletion of a file (AFAIK).
Cheers, Andreas
