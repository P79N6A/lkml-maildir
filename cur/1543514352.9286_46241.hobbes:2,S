Hi
My apologies if someone has already reported this. I had my x86 single
procesor box lock solid with 2.3.24 when trying to ls a smbfs mounted
directory just now:
I found this in the logs:
Oct 28 11:05:55 flat kernel: Kernel panic: put_cached_page: page count=1
I hope it helps someone track down the problem. More details on request
through direct email to me please.
Thank you!
