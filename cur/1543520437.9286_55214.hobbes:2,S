I haven't been able to reproduce this condition with the version that was
submitted.  On a 64MB machine I created 12 4MB ramdisks, did
"mke2fs /dev/rd/$i", and filled all of them with
"dd if=/dev/zero of=/rd.$i/big bs=1024 count=3933".  There was some
swapping while writing the final one, to make enough space.  I also tried
filling all of them by writing directly to each block device.  Again there
was some swapping while filling the last one.
The first version of the patch (which I think is still on your web site),
had a bug which protected the wrong buffer in many/most cases.  Perhaps this
is what you are using?
If you can reproduce this with the current version, please let me know
exactly how to do it.
