 I don't know of any games, but X11 doesn't work that way.  What I mean
X11 needs to know what keys are currently pressed and which are not.  It
handles that itself by tracking key presses and releases for all keys, so
both kinds of events need to be reported properly.  OTOH, the console
doesn't really care about key releases except from modifier keys. 
 I'm sorry if my statement was ambiguous.
