Hi,
  I was looking into usage of ia32 debug registers in 2.3.16 kernel
and I found that anybody with ptrace rights to any process can confuse
vm86 applications, if I did not miss something, because of we are setting
DR7 lazy, but we do not check thread.debugreg[7] in do_debug() if exception
came from VM86 mode (doing handle_vm86_trap() doing in turn do_int() or
send_sig(SIGTRAP)). We check this if exception came from 32-bit code
and I think that we should do this check in all cases, not only for 32bit
code.
  Is it intentional (I do not think...) or did I miss DR7 clear/load
somewhere else? Or is VMM using vm86() syscall responsible for handling
this spurious traps?
                                Thanks,
                                        Petr Vandrovec
