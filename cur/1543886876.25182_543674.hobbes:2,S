I doubt it will matter - I don't think we are marking the inode dirty at
the right point.
The change that was at fault modifies the way we update the file
size on the inode. We added an in-memory copy of the file size to
the in-memory copy of the disk inode's file size that we already
keep. We now only update the disk inode's (in memory copy) file size
on I/O completion. Because the generic code writes the inode out
before waiting for I/O to complete, the old file size gets written
out instead of the new one.
If the write was to extending the file into an existing block there
would be no delalloc transaction to redirty the inode (happens on
log I/O completion). Hence when the I/O completes and the file size
gets updated to the in-core disk inode (which is marked dirty), the
linux inode remains clean. As a result, a sync will never flush the
inode to get the updated file size to disk.
What I don't understand is that on unmount dirty xfs inodes get
written out. Clearly this is not happening - either there's a hole
in the writeback logic (unlikely - it was unchanged) or we've missed
some case where we need to update the filesize and mark the inode
dirty.
Hmmmm - if the write was just a short append to the file, then the
block that was written to should already be mapped. Then we'll just
look up the extent by doing a BMAPI_READ lookup, set the type to
IOMAP_READ and add the block to ioend we are building.
The type IOMAP_READ determines the I/O completion behaviour - in this case
it is xfs_end_bio_read(), which fails to update the file size....
Bingo.
A patch for you to try, Jeremy. I've just started a test run on it...
Cheers,
Dave.
