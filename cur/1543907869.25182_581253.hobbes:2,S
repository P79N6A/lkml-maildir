I had a feeling it might be.

Sounds quite unpleasant and actively harmful - keeping stuff in plain
readable C makes it easier to handle by most people.

Agreed, consistency is good.

I believe you meant to say "volatile" and not "atomic" above.  But
yes, if volatile is sufficiently defined to ensure it does what we
want in this case and using it means we can actually speed up the
kernel, then it does indeed sound reasonable. Especially since it's
confined to the implementation of atomic_t which most people shouldn't
be looking at anyway (but simply use) and when using an atomic_t it's
pretty reasonable to expect that it doesn't need any additional
locking or barriers since it's supposed to be *atomic*.

Can't argue with that.
It seems you've thought it through.  I just wanted to be sure that
this approach was actually the one that makes the most sense, and
you've convinced me of that :-)
