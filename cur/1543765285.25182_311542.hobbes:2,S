This was fixed post-2.6.11.  Can you confirm that 2.6.12-rc2 works OK?
This is the patch we used.  It should go into -stable if it's not already
there.
From: Alexander Nyberg <alexn@dsv.su.se>
I looked at some of the oops reports against keyrings, I think the problem
is that the search isn't restarted after dropping the key_user_lock, *p
will still be NULL when we get back to try_again and look through the tree.
It looks like the intention was that the search start over from scratch.
