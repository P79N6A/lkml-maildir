Hi Linus - I'm seeing filesystem corruption (on ext3 anyway) with -rc3; 
there is no such corruption on -rc2.  It would be better if somebody 
with a clue reported this; but since I haven't seen anything, I thought 
I'd hollar before somebody loses work as a result.  (Everybody does real 
work on -rc kernels, don't they? :-)
I untarred a kernel tarball into a directory, renamed it "foo", reboot 
(to clear disk cache), and then did this:
pinhead:/usr/src/kernels# rm -r foo &
[1] 3268
pinhead:/usr/src/kernels# tar xzf linux-2.6.9.tar.gz
rm: cannot remove `foo/include/asm-ppc/linkage.h': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `foo/include/asm-x86_64/rtc.h': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `foo/include/asm-m68knommu/mcftimer.h': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `foo/include/asm-m68k/linkage.h': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `foo/include/asm-sparc64/rwsem.h': No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove `foo/include/asm-sparc/psr.h': No such file or directory
[1]+  Exit 1                  rm -r foo
pinhead:/usr/src/kernels#
Running e2fsck on the next boot reports I've got a damaged filesystem.
System is a generic PC (a Dell GX110) - I810 chipset, PIII, IDE.  
Untainted vanilla kernel.  Other config details upon request.
