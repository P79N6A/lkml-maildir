The reason it's hanging is that nobody releases the driver, so we wait
forever in driver_unregister().  With the below, box boots fine...
--- drivers/base/bus.c.org	2007-02-18 08:38:57.000000000 +0100
+++ drivers/base/bus.c	2007-02-18 08:39:09.000000000 +0100
@@ -593,6 +593,7 @@ void bus_remove_driver(struct device_dri
 	driver_detach(drv);
 	module_remove_driver(drv);
 	kobject_unregister(&drv->kobj);
+	driver_release(&drv->kobj);
 	put_bus(drv->bus);
 }
 
...but that can't be right given that the darn thing booted just fine
prior to the naming patch with an equally unhappy init_ipmi_si().  Hmm.
