This RFC is about SAS.

Imagine you could connect to the same device via two
different PCI controllers on the same host.

Hmm, this proposal is for SAS only, Christoph.
If you have multiple SAS host adapters connected to the same
SAS domain, the _path_ they connect to a SAS device may be _different_.
But what is the same is the SAS domain (topology) itself *regardless of
how you connect to it.*
In order to eliminate duplication of sysfs entries (directories
and files) to describe the same SAS device, we split up the
representation into a "flat" directory with just a bunch
of SAS devices, this is /sys/bus/sas/.  And the way you _connect_
to those SAS devices is represented in sys/class/sas_ha/.
See this (new) picture:
           |                        |
+-------+  |                        |
|ha0 [] =--|-----------.            |
+---||||+  |            \  +-----+  |
           |             `-= ex2 =--|--> ta0
           |               |     =--|--> in2
           |             .-=     =--|--> ta2
+-------+  |  +-----+   /  +-----+  |
|ha1 [] =--|--= ex1 =--'            |
+---||||+  |  +-----+               |
           |                        |
Host domain| Sysfs SAS domain only  | Both domains
Anything *but* "Host domain" is "out there" and *doesn't
change* regardless of how you connect to it.
What changes is *how you connect* to to SAS devices from
your host (the host domain).
In effect ta0, in2, ta2, ex1, ex2 are represented only *once*,
in /sys/bus/sas/.  But the way your host adapter connects to
them is described in /sys/class/sas_ha/, with the appropriate
symbolic links as described in the RFC.
