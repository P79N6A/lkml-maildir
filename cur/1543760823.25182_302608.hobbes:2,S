Perhaps we could have a rule like
"non-experimental driver may only print out one line per actual
device?"
(and perhaps: dmesg output for boot going okay should fit on one screen).
Or perhaps we should have warnings-like regression testing.
"New kernel 2.8.17 came: 3 errors, 135 warnings, 1890 lines of dmesg
junk".
