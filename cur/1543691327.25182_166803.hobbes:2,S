Trying video=atyfb:mclk:-1,xclk:-1, same result
Note that the xclk and mclk actually used by MacOS are 67.12Mhz, this
may be different from the values setup by the firmware, on those old
machines, the firmware uses 'approximative' values at best while the
MacOS driver has the optimal ones. (Those machines had MacOS partially
in ROM and never really went to the firmware for display except if
you use linux ;)

Reverting these didn't help neither

It does indeed.
Here's the debug output:
