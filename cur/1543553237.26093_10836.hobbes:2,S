But redhat's compiler is much, much buggier, as has been discussed here
as well. Actually, redhat's gcc branch fails to compile a large amount of
userspace applications that aren't buggy.
I thought redhat already agreed that they made a bad decision in many
regards and the real reason for having the compiler was mere policy of not
switching the compiler duing a major release, and rehdat wanted to have a
newer compiler in any case.
