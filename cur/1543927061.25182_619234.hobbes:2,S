It's fine by me that this should go into 2.6.22-stable, but then please
also put in this related patch from 2.6.23-stable: it's arguable whether
either are strictly needed (they were originally provoked by unionfs, in
Ubuntu but not mainline), but more helpful to include than exclude them.
Thanks,
Hugh
Subject: [patch 12/13] fix tmpfs BUG and AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE
-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
patch 487e9bf25cbae11b131d6a14bdbb3a6a77380837 in mainline.
It's possible to provoke unionfs (not yet in mainline, though in mm and
some distros) to hit shmem_writepage's BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)).  I expect
it's possible to provoke the 2.6.23 ecryptfs in the same way (but the
2.6.24 ecryptfs no longer calls lower level's ->writepage).
This came to light with the recent find that AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE could
leak from tmpfs via write_cache_pages and unionfs to userspace.  There's
already a fix (e423003028183df54f039dfda8b58c49e78c89d7 - writeback: don't
propagate AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE) in the tree for that, and it's okay so
far as it goes; but insufficient because it doesn't address the underlying
issue, that shmem_writepage expects to be called only by vmscan (relying on
backing_dev_info capabilities to prevent the normal writeback path from
ever approaching it).
That's an increasingly fragile assumption, and ramdisk_writepage (the other
source of AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATEs) is already careful to check
wbc->for_reclaim before returning it.  Make the same check in
shmem_writepage, thereby sidestepping the page_mapped BUG also.
