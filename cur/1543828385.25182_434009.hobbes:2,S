why don't you just restart atmarpd?  After all, if you are unplugging and
replugging your modem, surely you can restart the daemon at the same time?
I didn't feel it was necessary to have an override mechanism for this new,
correct behavior (which makes things better for people using pppd, i.e. most
people) since a simple workaround exists.
What is very bad however is that atmarpd is still not fixed.  I had a look,
got stuck, and asked for help on the linux-atm list, but no-one replied.
There has been no progress since then.  I will have another look - maybe
you can too?
Best wishes,
Duncan.
