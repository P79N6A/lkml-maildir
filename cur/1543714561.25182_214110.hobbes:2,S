Subject: [BK PATCH] Driver Core update for 2.6.6-rc1

Hi,
Here are a few driver core changes for 2.6.6-rc1.  These have all been
in the -mm tree for a number of weeks now.  They fix a few minor bugs,
and add sysfs class support to a few miscellaneous drivers.
I'd like to thank Andrew for fixing the vc bug so that the sysfs class
patch that I've been sitting on for months can be added to the main
tree, that was pretty nasty...
Please pull from:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/driver-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
