'generic unpluggable kernel RAM' means what it says: any RAM seen by the 
kernel can be unplugged, always. (as long as the unplug request is 
reasonable and there is enough free space to migrate in-use pages to).

reliable unmapping of "generic kernel RAM" is not possible even in a 
virtualized environment. Think of the 'live pointers' problem i outlined 
in an earlier mail in this thread today.
