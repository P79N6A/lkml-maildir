Subject: [RFC][PATCH] request_irq(...,SA_BOOTMEM);
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In various places, architectures need to request interrupts early during
boot. Before slab is initialized typically. We used to have all sorts of
arch hacks to do so, which ended up being turned into something like:
static struct irqaction xxx_irq = { xxx_irq_handler, 0, CPU_MASK_NONE,
"xxx", NULL, NULL };
 .../...
setup_irq(&xxx_irq);
(for example fpu_irq in i386's i8259.c)
I quite dislike that and would like to propose that patch instead,
adding an SA_BOOTMEM flag that can be used to request IRQs before slab
is initialized. (Note that the register_* calls to the proc code aren't
protected, they shouldn't be a problem as they test for the /proc/irq
root node before doing anything and this can't have been created if slab
doesn't work).
Of course, an SA_BOOTMEM irqaction can't be freed. My proposed patch
"disconnects" it completely and just skips the freeing step but we might
want to refuse with a WARN_ON() attempts to free_irq() such an interrupt
instead. Note that the existing practice using a static descriptor
doesn't protect against such attempts at freeing.
Ben.
