No, you can't deadlock here.  When you get contention on the i_sem,
one thread will be put to sleep, and when that happens, the BKL will
be automatically released.
So:
  CPU0				CPU1
  BKL
				i_sem
				BKL (spins, waiting for BKL to be released)
  i_sem (finds it locked,
       and sleeps, which
       releases the BKL)
                                (BKL is now released, CPU1 continues)
