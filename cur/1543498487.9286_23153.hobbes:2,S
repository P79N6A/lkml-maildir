Are you positive that its the ac* patches that are causing it? I have been
getting those same effects (click twice a second approx) all throughout
2.2. I have been able to work around it by simply unloading and reloading
the sound modules before launching quake; I've just always assumed it was
a bugger in quake, since it was the only program giving me any troubles.
