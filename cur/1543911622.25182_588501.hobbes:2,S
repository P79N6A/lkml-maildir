Applied both patches, and now all I get from irda at boot time now is this:
[  292.062000] irda_init()
[  292.063000] NET: Registered protocol family 23
[  292.069000] IrCOMM protocol (Dag Brattli)
[  292.221000] PPP generic driver version 2.4.2
in other words, business as usual. Thanks.
Feel free to stick this on both patches:
