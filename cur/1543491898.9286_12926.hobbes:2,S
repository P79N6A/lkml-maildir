    Huh?
    using 2.2.5 IA32-linux here
    rdev output gave:
    root@OLK:/root>rdev
    /dev/sdc1 /
    but look at mtab: df output gives this
    root@OLK:/root>df
    Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
    /dev/sdd1            1406680 1315162    18826     99%   /
    /dev/md0             4022328 3727085    87128     98%   /mnt/md0

    The root system is apearently on /dev/sdd1
    but in reality it's /dev/sdc1 because /dev/sdd1 is look here:
    Any hints?
    Little disapointed here,
Hmm - it is your responsibility to keep this entry correct.
You failed to do so, and apparently succeeded in confusing yourself.
[When a filesystem is mounted, a filename is given, and mount can keep
track of things in /etc/mtab. However, for the root filesystem this
fails, and you have to store the filename of the root device in /etc/fstab.
Apparently you wrote /dev/sdd1 in fstab.]
