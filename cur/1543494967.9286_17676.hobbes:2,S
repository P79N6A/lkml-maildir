I think you won't find many CS schools teaching that kind of thing --- at
least, not in "x86 handles it *this* way" terms, except possibly as an
example of a particular response.  If you want to find out the ugly details
for a particular processor family, you need to get friendly with the
technical documentation for the processors.
(No, it's not a "given" that all CPUs respond that way.  No doubt there are
many processors that simply hang....)
