Do you think there's 60-80mb of good cachable data? ;-)  The "double"
is based upon many hundreds of test runs.  I "know" that performance
is best with this load when the cache stays around 25-35Mb.  I know
this because I've done enough bend adjusting to get throughput to
within one minute of single task times to have absolutely no doubt.
I can get it to 30 seconds with much obscene tweaking, and have done
it with zero additional overhead for make -j 30 ten times in a row.
(that kernel was.. plain weird. perfect synchronization.. voodoo!)

Nope.  I've bent this vm up a little and build kernels that kicked the
snot out of the previous record holder (classzone).  I know for a fact
that it can kick major butt.. why I fiddle with it when it doesn't.
