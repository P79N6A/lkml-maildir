Hi!
I just wanted to know if anybody knows why my newly compiled 2.4.17 (.config
attached) won't boot on
my Pentium MMX 266 (64 Mbytes mem., RedHat 7.1). I installed it like I did
some times before (Did the procedure change since 2.4.7?) but it stopped
after "Loading newkernel ........". I tried both gcc and kgcc.
Regards,
Friedrich
P.S. please cc any responses to me -- i am not a victim of the linux-kernel
list!
