I'd prefer to solve this issue with the following patch, that makes it 
still possible to select CONFIG_STANDALONE with EXPERIMENTAL=n:
--- init/Kconfig.old	2004-05-10 14:41:42.000000000 +0200
+++ init/Kconfig	2004-05-10 14:42:08.000000000 +0200
@@ -42,7 +42,7 @@
 	  If unsure, say Y
 
 config STANDALONE
-	bool "Select only drivers that don't need compile-time external firmware" if EXPERIMENTAL
+	bool "Select only drivers that don't need compile-time external firmware"
 	default y
 	help
 	  Select this option if you don't have magic firmware for drivers that
