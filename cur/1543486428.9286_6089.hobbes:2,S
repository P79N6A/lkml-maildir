G. Allen Morris III was overheard saying:
: Try `df -i' and read the mke2fs man page (-i option).
But I don't show them all used up...
{25}: df -i
Filesystem           Inodes   IUsed   IFree  %IUsed Mounted on
/dev/hda1             128016   20311  107705    16%  /
/dev/hda3             628736    4133  624603     1%  /usr/users
I guess it's possible they all got used up and then freed but that's quite
a large number of inodes.
