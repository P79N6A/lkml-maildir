Firstly, I'll say I'm no x86 expert by any means.  However, it may be
better to extend the pte bit handling functions in
include/asm-i386/pgtable.h to include the bits you need to handle.
(eg, see how pte_mkwrite and pte_wrprotect are implemented.)  This is
probably the cleanest way of handling these bits.
