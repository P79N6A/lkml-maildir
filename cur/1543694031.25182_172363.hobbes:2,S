In July of 2002, Andrea Arcangeli posted a patch
(see thread http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102772338115172&w=2)
to dump module names and address ranges during oops logging,
and said that there should eventually be a "module tracking aware ksymoops":

He has carried that patch forward, and it's e.g. in his current 2.4 tree:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.23pre6aa3/90_module-oops-tracking-3
Looking at ksymoops' source and Changelog, it isn't obvious whether
ksymoops-2.4.9 is "module tracking aware" yet.  Has anyone worked
on this?
Thanks,
Dan
