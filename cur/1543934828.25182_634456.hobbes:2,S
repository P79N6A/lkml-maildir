No, but if you configure in EDD support (and don't disable it), then the 
kernel will do so on your behalf during early boot.
Unfortunately, it is not trivial to produce a mapping from EDD data to 
real-life disks.  Your best bet is if the disks have an MBR signature, 
in which case the EDD code will capture those; you can then correlate 
them to real disks.
