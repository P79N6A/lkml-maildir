I am running kernel 2.4.18 + SGI xfs 1.1 + Trond NFS patch +
ext2_get_block_blk_removal on bi-PIII SMP kernel (Compaq DL360) with 4Gb
memory
the ps -ef hang in reading /proc/<pid>/stat after displaying some of the
process.
top & vmstat hang too !
the rest of process continue to run OK !
the machine was up for 1 week before this ! and now it's 2 time in 4 hour
which it does this !
NB : look like "ps -ax hang with Mozilla in 2.4.9" but I am on a 2.4.18 !!
but don't find how it have been corrected to check !
any help would be appreciated !
