But we can validate the contents of con2fb_map[] everytime it is used, right?

So we cannot go back, but we can go forward.
And why can we rmmod the fbdev? It's supposed to be marked busy when fbcon is
using it.

Yuk. This is very bad.
BTW, can't we just call take_over_console() again in register_framebuffer() so
we at least can do `insmod xxxfb' again?

Promcon runs before fbcon, AFAIK.
SGI Indy boxes don't use fbcon, but solely newportcon.

Don't worry about dnfb (I assume your grep found `0x0FA0000'? :-). Dnfb is for
frame buffers in Apollo Domain boxes. No conflict with vgacon.

This is another problem: because in many cases the vgacon and the fbcon card
are the same device, there should be a possibility to ask vgacon to `release'
the card (and its resources) first. Replace `vgacon' with `offb' on
PowerMac/CHRP.
BTW, `insmod vga16fb' works fine on boxes without vgacon, where vga16fb does
the second video card :-)
