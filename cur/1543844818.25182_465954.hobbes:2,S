Well, but any testing/debugging would have to be invalidated for a
merge, sorry. suspend2 has diverged too much.
"normal files" are not big priority for us, and you could probably do
them in userland just now.... Anyway, diff -u for kernel or preferably
for uswsusp parts would be welcome.
Telling us how much suspend2 rocks with each and every mail... is not
that welcome.
