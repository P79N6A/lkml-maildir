tested on rc2-mm2. It works.
I think it would be really good to hear somebody from the ndiswrapper 
group about this thread. During these 6 months (?) i believe both the 
kernel and ndiswrapper could go very far with a good collaboration.
Another thing: shouldnt be more efficent and readable to remove those 
"if ((strcmp...." from modules.c and to put all the tainted modules 
names into a separate source file into, say, a string array ? What if we 
had 250 tainted modules ?
And finally, it seems to me that ideas are not perfectly clear about 
what Linux should / should not do in respect to
- GPLed
- NON GPLed
- (???) GPLed
drivers. I believe policies and potential problems should be cristal 
clear before making any implementation.
