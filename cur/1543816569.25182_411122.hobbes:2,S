I actually prefer the multiple returns. You then don't have to "visually 
scroll down" to the label to see what would happen when reading the 
code. Even when there's common code before the return, I've never seen 
GCC not optimise that to the goto form itself. You obviously the boss 
though.

I assume that Greg hasn't commented yet since he's busy rewriting it 
all, so that'll be okay :-)
