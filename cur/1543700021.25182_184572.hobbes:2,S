I considered it in the beginning. For device driver itself, it is not a 
problem. For example, I can define
struct pcie_dev_config {
  void* base;
  int (*read)(pcie_dev_config* conf, unsigned reg, int len, u32* value);
  int (*write)(pcie_dev_config* conf, unsigned reg, int len, u32 value);
}
and have constructor/destructor functions that use device coordinates to 
calculate physical base and ioremap() it.
What you will miss, is uniform access for all devices, including those 
you are not managing as PCI-E. Notable
example is bridges. I can't provide more info (see prev. mail about 
brain dead, I don't want it to be my last day at work),
but you may found appropriate to tweak some stuff for bridges in 
extended space. One may use /proc/bus/pci/ or 'setpci'
for this. Obviously, in this case you have no driver, and generic access 
method would help you.
Also, 'lspci' don't know about device drivers, it need generic way to 
access config.
And, strictly say, if it is method that replaces old one, wouldn't it 
more appropriate to use it rather then rely
on backward compatibility hooks? I know, "work - don't touch", but...
