X and Y are the same. But I don't really get why this is still
"different" ... If you think this could be because of the fs
fragmentation then I will enhance my test. I think I have a spare
partition somewhere which I can format each time before untar the
kernel sources and so on. But why can I reproduce the results then?
Ok, not exactly but the results do get close ...
Furthermore I am timing not only the make -j<value> but also the
complete untar and applying of patches. So basically I am timing the
following:
tar xvf linux-x.y.z.tar
patch -p0 < some_patches
cd linux; cp ../config-x.y.z .config
make oldconfig dep
make -j $PAR bzImage modules
and afterwards
cd .. ; rm -rf linux
and start again. Its just the same as doing 'rpm --rebuild' with
MAKE=make -j $PAR

No, but I don't understand why this should make any difference. I do not
propose my way of testing as *the* benchmark. Its just a benchmark of
something which I do most of the time on my system (compiling) in an
extreme way ...
Kind regards,
