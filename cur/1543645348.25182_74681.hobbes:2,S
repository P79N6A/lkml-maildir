Not exactly. The caller always knows meaning of the returned value
(or it reports error etc). The caller doesn't just know size of the value
_in_advance_, as it isn't constant. Still, meaning of the variable portion
of the data is defined by the constant part.
It won't be a problem if allocating space is a kernel task.

Of course, I didn't want to include all the member structs directly
in ifreq definition (in the header file). I just did it for the purpose
of discussion.

Yes. That's why I want to finally have a well-designed interface,
with no need for changes in the future (except as needed for new
interfaces/protocols etc).
That's why I want to do it in 2.5 and then downport it to 2.4
and possibly even to 2.2.
