Subject: how to measure scheduler latency on powerpc?  realfeel doesn't work due to /dev/rtc issues

I'm trying to test the scheduler latency on a powerpc platform.  It appears that 
a realfeel type of program won't work since you can't program /dev/rtc to 
generated interrupts on powerpc.  Is there anything similar which could be done?
Thanks,
Chris
