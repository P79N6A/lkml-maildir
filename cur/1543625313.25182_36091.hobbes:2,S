I hate to jump in here (really I do) but 'a' probably happens alot.  All
of the recommended locations are system directories.  As for 'b' and
'c', I think those are considered trivial things to do, since this would
be a relativly easy thing to expliot (search some of the security list
archives, this isn't quite as easy as the buffer overflow on x86
problem, but still trivial).

But yes, this is a trivial problem which is now fixed.  And in the grand
scheme of things, there'll be more important fixes in the next version
of BK than the possibility of overwriting files at installtime.
