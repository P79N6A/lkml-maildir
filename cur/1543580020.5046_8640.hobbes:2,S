Hi,
This one-liner fixes a subtle 21143 autonegotiation problem for me on a Zynx
quad card.  The driver would claim to negotiate 100-FD, but would report late
collisions and bad transmit throughput.
The driver still allows packets to be transmitted during autonegotiation,
but that only drops a few packets.
