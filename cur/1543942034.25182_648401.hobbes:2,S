Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'agp-patches' branch from
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/agp-2.6.git agp-patches
It adds initial support for chipset flushing along with some intel pciids.
Dave.

    intel-agp: fixup resource handling in flush code.
    
    The flush code resource handling was having problems where some BIOS
    reserve the resource in a pnp block and some don't.
    
    Also there was a bug in that configure was being called at resume
    and resetting some of the structs.

    agp: remove unnecessary pci_dev_put
    
    pci_get_class implicitly does a pci_dev_put on its second argument, so
    pci_dev_put is only needed if there is a break out of the loop.
    
    The semantic match detecting this problem is as follows:
    
    // <smpl>
    @@
    expression dev;
    expression E;
    @@
    
    * pci_dev_put(dev)
      ... when != dev = E
    (
    * pci_get_device(...,dev)

    agp: remove uid comparison as security check
    
    In the face of containers and user namespaces, a uid==0 check for
    security is not safe.  Switch to a capability check.
    
    I'm not sure I picked the right capability, but this being AGP
    CAP_SYS_RAWIO seemed to make sense.

    agp/intel: Add chipset flushing support for i8xx chipsets.
    
    This is a bit of a large hammer but it makes sure the chipset is flushed
    by writing out 1k of data to an uncached page. We may be able to get better
    information in the future on how to this better.

    intel-agp: add chipset flushing support
    
    This adds support for flushing the chipsets on the 915, 945, 965 and G33
    families of Intel chips.
    
    The BIOS doesn't seem to always allocate the BAR on the 965 chipsets
    so I have to use pci resource code to create a resource
    
    It adds an export for pcibios_align_resource.

    agp: add chipset flushing support to AGP interface
    
    This bumps the AGP interface to 0.103.
    
    Certain Intel chipsets contains a global write buffer, and this can require
    flushing from the drm or X.org to make sure all data has hit RAM before
    initiating a GPU transfer, due to a lack of coherency with the integrated
    graphics device and this buffer.
    
    This just adds generic support to the AGP interfaces, a follow-on patch
    will add support to the Intel driver to use this interface.
