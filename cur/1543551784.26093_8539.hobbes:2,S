Yes but there is a way to do this directly now, the question is can the
user-space apps change to go both ways.  We will be able to do direct rw
to dvd-ram soon (patch to be released).  Also with the new drop and burn
standard that is in the works, the burning engin will be in the device and
remove the burden of support form the OS.
