No problem.  BTW, we have reworked the interfaces once more and
will send out the latest revision in the next couple of days -
it does away with commands and flags completely, except for this
one instance of flags in the set operation...

The purpose is to provide user tools with more control over the
creation or updating of an attribute and its value.  I don't think
the replace flag is very widely used, but I have seen the create
flag used in places - eg. the XFS fsr tool uses that flag.
The IRIX extended attribute interfaces provide these flags - Andreas
has also examined the implementations, man pages, etc, of several other
operating systems, so he'll be able to tell us if any others provide
this sort of thing too.
cheers.
