 Now that I am looking at the right output file -- yes, it does (after fixing
one small bug.)  Volanomark set a new record of 6125 messages/sec and the
profile shows almost zero hits in math_state_restore.
 Since fxsave leaves the FPU state intact, there ought to be a better way to do
this but it gets tricky.  Maybe using the TSC to put a timestamp in every thread
save area?
  when saving FPU state:
        put cpu# and timestamp in thread state info
        also store timestamp in per-cpu data
  on task switch:
        compare cpu# and timestamps for next task
        if equal, clear TS and set TS_USEDFPU
  when state becomes invalid for some reason:
        zero cpu's timestamp
But the extra overhead might be too much in many cases.
(Below is what I changed in the original patch, if anyone wants to try it.)
+               if (tsk_used_math(next_p))
should be:
+               if (!tsk_used_math(next_p))
