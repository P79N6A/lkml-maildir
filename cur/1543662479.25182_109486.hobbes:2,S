I can split it as:
-1.3.6+bugfixes (the patch I submitted to the Red Hat bugzilla)
-1.3.7 (VLAN support)
-1.3.9 (64-bit support)
-1.4.1 (NAPI support)
But I'd like to hear first if my previous mail addressed your concerns.  
BTW, if I didn't make it clear enough: that 4 slot reservation is an
optimization, not a workaround -- it would work correctly even without it,
but you'd get really sucky behavior with SG skbuffs.
