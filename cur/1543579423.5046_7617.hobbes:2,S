Sorry, I realise now what I said was ambiguous.  To be clear
2.2.17 - absolutely standard as shipped in debian - no errors
2.4.0 - standard (downloaded tar.bz2) - ERRORS
2.4.0 - as standard except for three files in tar.bz2 attachment to
Vojtech Pavlik's mail which were placed in drivers/ide directory -
ERRORS.
