ChangeSet@1.1976, 2005-01-27 01:18:50-05:00, dtor_core@ameritech.net
  Input: ACK/NAK processing rules in libps2 were too strict - while it is a
         good idea to discard any character other than ACK/NAK during probe
         it causes missing releases and keys getting "stuck" when a command
         issued on enabled device. The effect is easily demonstrated with
         the following command:
             while true; do xset led 3; xset -led 3; done
  
         With this change extra characters will be discarded only if device
         has not been marked as "enabled" yet.
