Color me unconvinced.
Tasklets fill a niche not filled by either workqueues (slower, requiring 
context switches, and possibly much latency is all wq's processes are 
active) or softirqs (limited number of them, not flexible at all). 
Sure, tasklets kick over to ksoftirqd, but not immediately, and therein 
lies their value.
And moving code -back- into hardirq is just the wrong thing to do, usually.
This proposal is ENTIRELY derived from "not convenient to my project" 
logic AFAICS, rather than the more sound "not needed in the kernel."
