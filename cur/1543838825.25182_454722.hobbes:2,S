all burning apps will retry a few times if they get "busy"....

doesn't help, since hal doesn't just open it, but also issues an ioctl
that then goes to the device, and THAT is causing the damage. Not the
open itself.

oh I really want to have this ioctl cached, but more so that the kernel
can enforce a reasonable polling interval ;)
