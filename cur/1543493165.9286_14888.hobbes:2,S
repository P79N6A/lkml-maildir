Hi,
I've just noticed that under Linux sockets are created
with real uid/gid and not effective as I expected. This
is done by two lines in sock_alloc():
inode->i_uid = current->uid;
inode->i_gid = current->gid;
Shouldn't this be euid or fsuid, similar to files, pipes,
or even unix domain socket inodes on disk?  If not, why?
