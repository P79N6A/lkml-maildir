Hmm. I am not sure I agree.
Usually type casts are bad, because they tell the compiler
not to check, and therefore may hide problems.
In a case like this, where a (void *) is returned, casting
to the proper pointer type is meaningful: it allows the compiler
to check the type, and the human eye to check that the right
amount of memory is allocated.
If you just write
	foo = kmalloc(n * sizeof(some_type), GFP_x);
then neither the compiler nor the human eye can check
easily that things are right, i.e. that foo really is
a (some_type *).
