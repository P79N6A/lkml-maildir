Hi.
there's a SMP race condition between __sync_single_inode (or __sync_one on
2.4.20) and __mark_inode_dirty. __mark_inode_dirty doesn't take inode
spinlock. As we know -- unless you take a spinlock or use barrier,
processor can change order of instructions.
CPU 1
modify inode
(but modifications are in cpu-local
buffer and do not go to bus)
calls
__mark_inode_dirty
it sees I_DIRTY and exits immediatelly
					CPU 2
					takes spinlock
					calls __sync_single_inode
					inode->i_state &= ~I_DIRTY
					writes the inode (but does not see
					modifications by CPU 1 yet)
CPU 1 flushes its write buffer to the bus
inode is already written, clean, modifications
done by CPU1 are lost
The easiest fix would be to move the test inside spinlock in
__mark_inode_dirty; if you do not want to suffer from performance loss,
use the attached patches that use memory barriers to ensure ordering of
reads and writes.
