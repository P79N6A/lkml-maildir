speedwise of such code path indeed but see below.

I don't see a big difference with the pages. if pagetables won't go into
highmem it will be pages that will go there. Infact with the pagetables
may be much better than with the pages. I mean it may be much better to
have the few megs filled with pagetables rather than with pages that we
may have to read(2)/write(2) all the time. We may end generating a
bigger kmap overhead if we put pages in there (of course it also depends
on the workload). It's not really obvious to me that 4G is an
improvement compared to 4G+pte-kmap on a 1G box. So I'm still not
convinced that the below differentiation of configuration options is
worthwhile.  comments?
