We already have device that do similar things -- WAP phones. These
don't actually implement pop3, but they implement PPP and talk to a
WAP gateway which then can run a kind of webmail (or indeed an kind
of wml based application).
Really horrible stuff... horribly flaky right now (well, the ones
we've tested anyhow). If it really matters, I can get tcpdumps of
what these phones do, but I would be really surprised if their window
size was terribly large...
