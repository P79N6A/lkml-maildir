Hmm...Guessing that it had something to do with set_blocksize, I added
this patch to the kernel:

It looks like it's not changing 03:02 (/dev/hda2, my root fs), which is
good, but it seems to be trying to change 03:42 (/dev/hdb2) even though
that device doesn't exist (which could also be fine, but it looks like it
wasn't initialized).  I'm guessing blksize_size is statically allocated,
so this isn't a problem.
I wonder what else could cause 03:02 to barf... Hmm.
