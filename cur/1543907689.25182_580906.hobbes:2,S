That is what my proposed patch did. One could argue that the test should come before the failure, 
not after, but the effect is the same.

I agree with you, but you and David can fight it out. While finding out where to ask/complain about 
udev, I had a private communication with GregKH. He thinks that a patch to fix this has already been 
pushed through Linus. As Linville's wireless-dev tree is a little behind, I'm waiting to see if it 
gets fixed here by 2.6.23-rc3. If not, I'll talk to the udev/hotplug folks.
