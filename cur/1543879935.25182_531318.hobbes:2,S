It would be more of a reason to like the patch, if more architectures
actually implemented flush_tlb_range as anything different from
flush_tlb_mm ;)  Sadly, few can do better than flush_tlb_mm: ia64
is the exception I remember, and maybe a couple of others.  I put
flush_tlb_range there merely because it seems more appropriate,
but it's rather deceptive.
