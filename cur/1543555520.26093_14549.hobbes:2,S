That sounds good.  One other refinement I would like to see is that
architecture specific but always present header files don't get used
directly in architecture-independant .c flies.  Some common examples of
this are <asm/io.h> and <asm/uaccess.h>  The problem is that often there
is some code that is identical between some or all of the archs.  Then
one of two things happen:
  * The code gets duplicated in many *.h files with all the bad things that
    comde duplication causes - especially since they're all under seperate
    maintainership
  * We have a big ugly conversion like what happened with 'asm/spinlock.h' ->
    'linux/spinlock.h'
If we only have arch-independant *.c files only include things out of
<kernel/*> (which may, of course, include things in <arch/*>) we can
avoid these conversions in the future and promote code reuse between the
architectures.
Also we should probably consider implementing a reasonalbe hierarchy to
the proposed <kernel/*.h> directory - for instance <kernel/bus/pci.h>.
