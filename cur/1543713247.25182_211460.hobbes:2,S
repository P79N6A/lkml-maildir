Hi,
I use swsusp as it is in 2.6.x.
If I do a echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep the laptop hibernates and resumes
ok.
If I do a echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep then the laptop does suspend-to-ram
right, but the resume is a problem: it resumes fine, but after the
resume it _immediately and automatically_ starts to go into hibernation
mode!? This is annying since there are situations where I want the
laptop just suspend-to-ram instead of hibernate..
WTF is going on here? Any ideas?
Grüße/Regards,
René
