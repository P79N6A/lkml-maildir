No, in fact, that would be expected. If you are going to apply John's
patches and mine, then you can remove the definition I put in time.c
(technically, I probably should have put that definition in a #ifndef
CONFIG_NEWTOD/#endif block).
My version is basically a non-NEWTOD attempt to get nanosecond uptime.
But, if you have John's timesources, then use them :)
Thanks,
Nish
