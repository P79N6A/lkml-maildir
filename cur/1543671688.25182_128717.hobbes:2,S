I've noticed this kicking about on people.redhat.com, which contains
patches and configs against 2.4.20 so you can brew a 2.4.20 rpm.
http://people.redhat.com/laroche/kernel-2.4.20-2.1.23.ent.src.rpm.tar.gz
It may provide a useful starting point to work out what you want to add
to 2.4.20 for RHAS, however I haven't used this in a production
environment so usual disclaimers apply :)
