Could you please come back to a) technical and b) Linux dependent
discussion? The flame war you're doing here (esp. Larry McVoy) is
definitely non-productive. Remember: we talk about Source Management for
Linux and not for a big archive or commercials.

To add some other points:
*the traditional solution for bugfixes in OpenSource is "take the newest
 version from the stable tree" - so the backup of older versions is
 definitely _no_ problem. Only few scientists will be interested in
 five-year-old Linux versions.
*Especially the Linux sources are mirrored on hundreds of servers all over
 the world, so if one server eats the files on it we can restore by
 catching any copy out there. If the main server (at Linus' side) crashes
 he still can catch a copy from somewhere and then ask the developers to
 resend their patches. Crashes are unlikely (under a stable Linux server)
 so this case will be very rare and the manual solution is acceptable.
*The mirror servers have quite large disks (remember: diskspace is cheap
 these days) - the size of the local image is no problem.
*Many developers have only slow and expensive Modem-lines to transfer and
 update theyr database. The questions are:
 - how much does the system compress my data (or even: may I plugin newer
   and better compression algorithms)
 - how much overhead does the transfer need (counted in bytes transferred
   through the net, not bytes stored on local/remote harddisk; call it
   compression of metadata)
 - may I chose in which changes I am interested and which not to transfer
   (eg. Alan may decide to transfer everything from Linus and some other
   trusted users but he might want to review a short description of the
   patch for those patches from everyone else)
*OpenSource is less hierarchical than commercial development - so it is
 necessary to get good (easy to understand) views of the various source
 trees and patches. And we would need flexible tools to (un)merge and
 change patches and to move whole sets of patches from one tree to
 another.
*Many developers will decide to hold their own local tree of patchsets. So
 we need a tool with a kind of access rights and distributed
 administration. The base server for the linus-tree will be another one
 than the base server for ac or davem. And the base servers definitely do
 not want to mirror my local tree. But I will want to crossreference
 patches from the linus-tree into my own.
*Most developers and most mirror sites don't have the money to buy $1000
 software (or more expensive), so it should be either cheap enough or
 OpenSource. And they don't need commercial support, they need a good
 README - they still are experts.
*Bugreports become difficult for Linux, because a) more and more newbies
 send bugreports without knowing what is important and b) there are many
 experts which just don't know enough about the kernel (because they are
 busy with other projects) to send excellent reports. So this tool (or a
 connected one) should be able to force the user to enter all important
 data (by asking appropriate questions) and then redirect the report to
 the right forum/developer.
*Most important: Linux changes in source _and_ in organization (with every
 feature added to the kernel a new group evolves and with every
 restructuring the responsibilities change). So the system should be very
 changeable - what means it should last only few weeks till there is a new
 feature in it. I know that any OpenSource project has this ability (if
 the maintainer disappeared or refuses to change it - I can ask anyone
 else to do that).
We talk about a really _big_ OpenSource project with really _many_ backups
all over the net. So don't talk about hypothetic cases where all the
servers crash or some nifty admin refuses to give me the backup tapes.  
What is needed is a way to handle the source management for Linux and
nothing else. My simple (but hard to answer) questions are these ones:
*Which of the above abilities does BK have and which does Aegis (or any
 other free tool) have?
*Which do they not have and how long would it take to fix that?
*Now the heaviest: does it become easier and faster to do this work with
 that tool? Or does it only help to solve the problems which we wouldn't
 have without it?
BTW: Larry, if you can't offer really cheap licenses to the mirror sites
and developers then be quiet from now on, we talk about OpenSource
development not about rich firms.
	happy thinking,
