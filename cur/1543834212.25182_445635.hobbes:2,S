No, its unrelated to crashing.  Only when adding/removing from a
directory that is in a specific node/btree format (many entries),
and only under a specific set of conditions (like what directory
entry names were used, which blocks they've hashed to and how they
ended up being allocated and in what order each block gets removed
from the directory).

Could be an issue, could be none.  xfs_check it to be sure.
cheers.
