I _knew_ I shouldn't have sent that email. Sigh.
It was a proof-of-concept.  Here ya go:
#define GFP_ATOMIC 1
#define GFP_KERNEL 2
typedef unsigned int size_t;
extern "C" void *kmalloc(size_t size, int flags);
char gfp_atomic[1];
char gfp_kernel[1];
inline void *operator new[](size_t size, char *where)
{
        if (where == gfp_atomic)
                return kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
        else if (where == gfp_kernel)
                return kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
        return 0;
}
char *foo(int n)
{
        return new (gfp_atomic) char[n];
}

But it's fun trying.
