???.  i have no idea what you were grepping through to find that
phrase, but TAINT_USER would seem to be equivalent to echo 64, not
echo 32, anyway, no?
in any event, as i posted in a followup, i'm assuming that that
particular bit is meant to be set explicitly from user space using
something like:
  # echo 64 > /proc/sys/kernel/tainted
