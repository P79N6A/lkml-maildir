rm(1) usually does a recursive call for handling -r (essentially a
postorder traversal), and this can run out of space. Rewriting it for no
recursion isn't fun, and not needed except for truly pathological cases,
which will blow up regardless. Besides, it will soon run out of maximal
filename length.
Better: Write a scripty that blows away one level, and then goes up one
level (..) to do the same. Start that one by descending into the "tree"s
bottom (miscreants usually just leave one long branch). Be careful on how
you stop...
