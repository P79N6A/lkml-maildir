_^_ I understand it now. Thank you for your patience in explaining this
to me. I learn quite a lot of things in <4 hours! Thank you everyone.
I'll try to make a good use of what I learn here, e.g. to write another
GNOME automounter that use the new "event status notification" and also
let users eject their CDs -
"without polling" - possible?
It must be real cool to write such daemon (polling make any hacker feel guilty).
