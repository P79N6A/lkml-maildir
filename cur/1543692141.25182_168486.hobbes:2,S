Well, the autorepeat-gone-bonkers is just a symptom, and a likely one,
not a cause. Few people will notice a missed keypress, just assume a bad
contact on the key, but a missing key release simply must cause infinite
autorepeat until another (or the same) key is pressed and released.

You do. Scrolling up/down in a document is one example. And there is no
point to limit the repeat to say 80 or 200 characters. You would still
hate having 80 repeated characters and then it stopping.
The problem really is there is no way to detect it. My latest patches
should fix this for AT keyboards by not using software autorepeat for
them.
Of course this won't fix any problems with USB, if there are still any.
My USB keyboard works just perfectly, no problems with the autorepeat.
