It was changed specially for mm in order to stress the antifrag code. If 
this causes trouble then do not merge the patches against SLUB that 
exploit the antifrag methods. This failure should help see how effective 
Mel's antifrag patches are. He needs to get on this dicussion.
Upstream has slub_max_order=1.
