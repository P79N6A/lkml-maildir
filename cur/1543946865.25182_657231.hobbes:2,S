Maybe it did trigger an IRQ.  Inside the watchdog routine interrupts 
are disabled.

I don't think so:
	CPU 0				CPU 1
	-----				-----
	Watchdog timer expires
	Timer routine acquires spinlock
					IAA IRQ arrives
					ehci_irq tries to acquire 
						spinlock...
	Timer routine either sets
		ehci->reclaim to NULL 
		or else starts a new
		IAA cycle
	Timer routine releases spinlock
		and returns
					ehci_irq acquires spinlock
						and sees IAA is set
					Call end_unlink_async()!

This might help, but it won't fix the race outlined above.
