Ok, I put the 8139D card in, did not work with either the 8139too or
8139cp driver.
Here is the lspci -vvvvvvvvvvv output(i'm lazy)
00:0d.0 Ethernet controller: Unknown device 00ec:8139 (rev 10)
        Subsystem: AOPEN Inc.: Unknown device 0027

I went into drivers/net/8139too.c and added a line
        {0x00ec, 0x8139, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, RTL8139 },
to the pci_id table with the 00ec:8139 address, and now the card works
with 8139too.
I assume the same fix in pci-skeleton.c would fix it for 8139cp, correct?
I am using the card right now, and seems to be working, although picked up
as a C
eth0: RealTek RTL8139 Fast Ethernet at 0xd0800000, 00:40:f4:64:bd:34, IRQ 10
eth0:  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8139C'
I'll modify pci-sketelon.c the same way, and see if 8139cp works.
