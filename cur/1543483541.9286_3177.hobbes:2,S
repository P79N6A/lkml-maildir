I run a shell sever with arround 100 eggdrops on it.  On the hour they all
write to the hard disk at the same time, this takes the system load upto
around 10-30.  (P II 333 UDMA HD 256 MEG RAM)
However, i monitered network trafic and it seemed stable enough until the
hour when it seems to just stop for about 15 seconds, i wouldn't of
thought disk access (which is obvously whats happening) should stop the
tcp/ip networking.  Does anyone have any ideas (other than killing all the
eggdrops/changing the times they all save/new machine)?
The chances are it's just due to the high cpu utilistation, although
strangly enough all the eggdrops arre reniced to a priority of 20, so i
thought networking ion the kernel would take priority over their disk
access.
thnx
