I've got a PCI BusLogic SCSI card at home I've been unable to use for
a while on 2.4, so I'm really interested in this patch.  
Maybe it's time to break out old the EISA, VLB, MCA and ISA support
into their own modules/sections?  I think the PCI version will be the
most in demand. 
Thanks though for your work!
