I tried to revert the commit:
$ git revert d71374dafbba7ec3f67371d3b7e9f6310a588808
First trying simple merge strategy to revert.
Simple revert fails; trying Automatic revert.
Auto-merging drivers/pci/bus.c
merge: warning: conflicts during merge
ERROR: Merge conflict in drivers/pci/bus.c
Auto-merging drivers/pci/pci.h
Auto-merging drivers/pci/probe.c
Auto-merging drivers/pci/remove.c
Auto-merging drivers/pci/search.c
fatal: merge program failed
Automatic revert failed.  After resolving the conflicts,
mark the corrected paths with 'git-update-index <paths>'
and commit the result.
I don't know how to go on. Could someone help me?
(I'm leaving tomorrow, I'll be back in 4 days.)
