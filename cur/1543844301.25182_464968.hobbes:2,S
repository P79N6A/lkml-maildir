Subject: Re: [PATCH 2/4] jiffies: Add 64bit jiffies compares (needed when long < 64bit).

These compares are there to use jiffies_64 safely on 32bit and 64 bit
systems, and jiffies_64 (and thus get_jiffies_64()) is always defined
as u64. Since this is not arch code, but generic for all
architectures, it should use the generic u64/s64 types. If the user
passes in a long and assumes that it's 64 bit, then it is user error.
I'll add a comment that says that these macros must be used with u64
values (as returned by get_jiffies_64()).
Thanks.

P.S. This also means that currently, on 64 bit systems,
time_before/time_after is broken (typecheck fails) on values returned
by get_jiffies_64().
