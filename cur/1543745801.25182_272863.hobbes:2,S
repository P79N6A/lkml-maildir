Hi Justin,
> Ok, let's try this (yet) again:
I'm sorry to insist be we really want this as a patch against
2.6.10-rc2. That's what Greg needs. As said earlier, the patch would
include the new adm1026.c file (obviously) as well as the necessary
changes to Kconfig and Makefile.
Other than that I'm fine with the code itself.
Thanks.
