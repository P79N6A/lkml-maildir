You broke the design. S3 support was developed long before swsusp was in 
the kernel, and completely indpendent of it. It should have remained that 
way. 
S3 support is a subset of what is need for S4 support. 
swsusp is an implementation of S4 support. In theory, there could be 
multiple implementations that all use the same core (saving/restoring 
state). 
There could also be different power management schemes that use swsusp as 
an implementation for suspend-to-disk. But, that's another tangent. 
CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP should give you S3 support, and the ACPI side of S4 
support. The comment in the config option should tell the user that they 
must choose a suspend implementation (e.g. CONFIG_SUSPEND, which should 
prolly be CONFIG_SWAP_SUSPEND) in order to get complete S4 support. (The 
ACPI side can make an empty call to swsusp if no implementation is 
selected). 
Some time ago, I made a BK repo for suspend support. I axed it, since no 
one ever used it. But, it's back again, and I'll be integrating your 
patches and try to dedicate a few extra cycles to resolving some of the 
issues. I'll send an announcement to the list once I've integrated your 
patches.
