The catch here is "optimize it."

I think one of the issues with 2.6 in general is that it doesn't auto-tune
as well as 2.4. While it's good to have controls, and I ran tuned -aa
kernels for several years because Andrea took the time to give me a two
screen primer on tuning bdflush, tuning 2.6 for i/o and CPU scheduling had
more benefits than 2.4. Unfortunately you now need to tune the algorithm
as well as the parameters, and in some cases the "tuning" needs to be done
with patch and gcc.

I'm going to disagree a little here, what needs to be done is to put i/o
and CPU scheduling in modules (some work has been done), so that kernels
can be tuned, and use of a default delection should be stable, at least
defined as not crashing or hanging, and producing some reasonable
performance with self tuning.

And there I agree, rewriting an app to go from 2.4 to 2.6 is fine, from
2.6.n to 2.6.n+1 isn't.

I hope you realize that the development model is decided by a democratic
vote, just be aware that there is only one voter.
