True -- that capability is provided by devfs+devfsd, which is supported
in the driver by using the existing 2.4 devfs hooks.  For that case one
would not mount the driver's devfs.
I look at it as an effective transition mechanism.  Device numbers are
frozen now, but devfs is not deployed now.  My solution gets us from
point A to point B, and is IMHO workable in the stable 2.4 series.  We
can go 100% devfs or whatever in 2.5 or 3.0..
