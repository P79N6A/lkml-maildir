You *do* have my data, but I buy the lazy argument. ;)

Amen, brother.  Anything complicated will contain bugs tomorrow, if
not already today.
Let's see.  Right now, we have two cases of multiple recursions:
WARNING: multiple recursions around check_sig()
WARNING: multiple recursions around usb_audio_recurseunit()
check_sig() is bad code and can be cleaned up.
Leaves usb_audio_recurseunit() as the only function in question, that
one could actually be sane, although it looks rather interesting:
WARNING: trivial recursion detected:
       0  usb_audio_recurseunit
WARNING: recursion detected:
      16  usb_audio_selectorunit
       0  usb_audio_recurseunit
WARNING: multiple recursions around usb_audio_recurseunit()
WARNING: recursion detected:
       0  usb_audio_recurseunit
       0  usb_audio_processingunit
Greg, can you say whether this construct makes sense?
