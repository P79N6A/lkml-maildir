I would prefer to keep the original code for now
(it has some subtle differences).

Is this really needed now that we've removed pipeline operation for write
requests?

How's about this version?

Subject: [PATCH 2/4] ide-tape: remove pipeline-specific code from idetape_add_chrdev_write_request
Refrain from adding more write requests to the pipeline and queue them
directly on the device's request queue instead.
[bart: re-do for minimal behavior changes]
