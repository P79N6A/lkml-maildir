I have tried to find some explanations about the phase changes your 
hard disk seems to experience.
The SPI2 standard says nothing about, but the latest SPI3 describes 
some exception handling in COMMAND phase that, if your drive behaves  
as described in that document, may explain the phase changes.
Note that the below behaviour described by latest SPI3 is quite legal for
SCSI-2 and can be used by any SCSI-2 device, even some old one. 
Basically, a target that detects a PARITY ERROR in COMMAND phase may elect
to switch to MESSAGE IN phase and send a RESTORE POINTERS message (that
will have the effect of a no-op), and then enter again the COMMAND phase
(this behaviour may explain 'phase change 2-7' driver messages) 
After some exhausted number of retries, the target may switch to STATUS 
phase and report CHECK CONDITION with sense 'ABORTED COMMAND'.
(this behaviour may explain 'phase change 2-3' driver messages.
Could you boot your system using the following boot options:
         sym53c8xx=debug:0x10
                  or
         ncr53c8xx=debug:0x10
(depending on the driver you are using)
With this debug flag, the driver will report any not GOOD status and also
print to the log the sense data sent by a target device after a CHECK
CONDITION status. 
Let me know if the driver prints out some additionnal messages with
'debug:0x10' option when your system experience phase changes. Thanks.
Regards,
   Gérard.
