Thanks in advance.
In the meantime, you may give a try with the newer major version of the
driver. It is available in latests 2.4.x and 2.5.x kernels and tarballs
usable under not too old linux-2.2.x are ftp-available:
 
ftp://ftp.tux.org/roudier/drivers/protables/sym-2.1.x/
sym-2.1.16-20011028.tar.gz should apply to linux-2.2.18.
This new major driver version uses EH threads for error recovery.
  Gérard.
