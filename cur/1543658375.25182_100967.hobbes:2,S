Well, I was actually thinking of really _stopping_ the USB controller and
disable DMA that way.  That's easy to do with a few trivial fixups - one
for each USB controller type (and there are only three).
Because of legacy USB handling by the SMM BIOS, USB really ends up being a
special case. There may be other special cases, of course, but the whole 
point of the fixups is exactly to handle special cases.
