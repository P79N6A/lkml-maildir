Cool, my ecs p4vxasd2+ (p4x333/kt8235/alc101) works with onboard sound
now.
What's the normal flow to get this added into ac97_codecs.c?
+        {0x414C4730, "ALC101",             &null_ops},
Adding this line into the table in ac97_codecs.c (with a few missing
#defines fixed... then I noticed they're already in -ac1 :) in
2.4.21-pre7 made sound work fine.
Now hopefully those of us who bought those Fry's "free" p4vxasd2+ 5.0's
can have sound.  I just mplayer'ed an avi with the new table entry and it
appears to work fine.  Volume controls look functional.  Will do some more
testing (record, etc.) tonight.
Thanks,
-bc
