I've experienced the same problem... 2.2.1, and 2.2.2pre2... There have been
a number of people who have brought this up... No one has really been
helpful in an answer as to how to fix.  Linus suggested 2.2.2pre2 to me a
short time ago, but just recently it happened with that so ...
For us it seems to occur once every few days .. with 2.2.1 it occurred maybe
once every 3 .. with 2.2.2pre2 its like evey 5-6 ..
I wish I knew the reason why it occurs, but I don't....
