$ uname -a ; uptime
Linux newyork-1 2.2.18 #3 Mon Dec 11 15:57:33 EST 2000 i686 unknown
  6:22pm  up 425 days,  1:35,  3 users,  load average: 0.10, 0.05, 0.01
This server is pretty remote and hard to reach, and not sure to reboot
properly unattended - are there predictions about how well 2.2.18 will
survive jiffy wraparound?
Would you consider it worth rebooting for? By the way, this is our second
most important production server, I'm exceedingly pleased with the
stability. We've abused it no end.
Thanks.
Regards,
bert
