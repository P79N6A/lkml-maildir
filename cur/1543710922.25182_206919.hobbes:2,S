If you have a system with an easy workload (say one clear CPU hog and
one interactive job), things are easy. The fact that you preempt the
not-yet expired CPU hog is enough.
That's easy, and that worked with 2.4 O(1) (if tweaked a bit to estimate
interactiveness better, see other patch) and it works with 2.6.
Things start to get difficult if you have something like a calculation
program with a non-multithreaded GUI. It will look like a CPU hog and
still you'd like to see it responsive. Now add a second CPU hog.
The kernel can not fix this problem, but it can limit the damage by 
not having too long timeslices.
There are other scenarios where the preemption will not solve all
problems.
Think two interactive processes, one playing audio, another one being
your shell. The audio player may take the CPU for extended periods of
times occasionally to decode the next N ogg frames. You still want the
shell to react promptly, but it can't ... Thus you wish the timeslice
not being too long.
Thus you'll set them not too long for desktop kind of machines to
not have to rely completely on the interactiveness estimator.

No doubt. Don't overdo it. It's a tradeoff. If you impact throughput too
much, you'll not enjoy the short latency ;-)

That's why I think we should offer the tunables.
