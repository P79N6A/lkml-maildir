Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/4] Hibernation: Arbitrary boot kernel support on x86_64 (rev. 2)

Hi,
The first two patches in this series make it possible to restore the memory
state from a hibernation image with the help of a kernel different from the
image one.
The first patch adds the generic, platform independent code needed for that.
The second patch implements the idea on x86_64.
The remaining two patches remove some implicit assumptions about the boot and
image kernels from the x86_64 restore code.
Greetings,
Rafael
