There is another thing that has changed - the scancode numbers. So if
you're using the same commands as on 2.4, you're setting scancodes for
different keys. We now use 'at keyboard - set 2' scancodes as opposed to
'xt keyboard - set 1' used by the older driver. See the 'dmesg' output
for keys ("unknown scancode ...") that are not known to the keyboard
driver.

Well, I'm not the maintainer of the kbd package, but I probably will
have to release a new tool to set the keycode table.
