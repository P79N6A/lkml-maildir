Parts of the initial submission were picked up (the include/asm 
directory), other's weren't.  Little we can do about that.

What is flat_set_persistent other than a stub to validate the relval? 
I'm not at all sure what you're proposing or how it would be different.

discussing a patch that adds an if statement, a local variable and one
