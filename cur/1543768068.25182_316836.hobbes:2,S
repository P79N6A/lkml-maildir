Greetings.
I am trying to diagnose a slow kernel memory leak, and am having no luck
in pining it down.
I am currently running unpatched 2.6.12-rc3 (x86 on Gentoo, I saw the
same symptoms with gentoo-sources 2.6.11-r6 and 2.6.11-r4.  Over the
course of several days, the server in question has the amount of
available memory (free minus buffers+cache) gradually decrease.  If I
leave it go, it does eventually thrash itself to death after about a
week (give or take).  The rate is about 150MB per day (the system has
2GB of RAM total so it takes several days).  The working set of
processes remains the same through the whole period at between 50-150MB
(depending on if you count VSZ or RSS).  Nothing shows up in dmesg
except for a couple of one-time lockd and nfs messages  (the system uses
two remote filesystems).  The local filesystems are ReiserFS on a 3Ware
7500-4 controller, and the NIC is an Intel E100.

I would be happy to provide any additional information.  As it stands, I
have to reboot about once a week to clear the RAM or else it thrashes
itself to death.
