No. Transparent complexity is never a problem - as long as it is 100%
transparent.

I think this is the main problem. I estimate (based on a crude
benchmark) that:
- For "short spinlock operation" (eg changing a linked list), this is a
major disadvantage
- for long-held spinlocks (eg. runqueue lock with huge load-avg's), it
would be a win.
This means:
1) unconditional "sti" in the slow path has no clear speed advantage.
2) it's nearly certain that a "spin_lock_irq_sti()" would improve the
speed, but it violates the transparency.
--> no sti in the slow path.
