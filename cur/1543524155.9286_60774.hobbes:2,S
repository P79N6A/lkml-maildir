Fix to ESS1788 on my Compaq 5536 from playing sounds too slowly.  The 
problem occurred
when I from Redhat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5-15) to Redhat 6.1 (kernel 2.2.12-20, 
the problem is
still there on kernel 2.2.14).  The program sndconfig detected my sound chip 
ESS1788 as
a ESS1888.  I had to modify the sb_ess.c to make the sound play correctly 
instead of
extremely slowly.
