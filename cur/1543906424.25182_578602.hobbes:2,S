I've now squinted the D-SACK RFC and understand a little about this,
however the RFC does make the claim "This extension is compatible with
current implementations of the SACK option in TCP.  That is, if one of
the TCP end-nodes does not implement this D-SACK extension and the other
TCP end-node does, we believe that this use of the D-SACK extension by
one of the end nodes will not introduce problems."
What if it turns out that is not true for a large enough number of SACK
implementations out there; in the timeframe that SACK was supported but
D-SACK was not supported.  Would it be possible to clearly catagorise an
implementation to be:
  * 100% SACK RFC compliant.  SACK works and by virtue of the mandatory
requirements written into the previous SACK RFCs then this
implementation would never see a problem with receiving D-SACK even
through the stack itself does not support D-SACK.
  * Mostly SACK RFC compliant.  SACK works but if it saw D-SACK it would
have a problems dealing with it, possibly resulting in fatal TCP
lockups.  Are there SACK implementation mandatory requirements in place
for to be able to clearly draw the line and state that the 2.6.9 SACK
implementation was not RFC compliant.
  * 100% SACK and D-DACK RFC compliant.  Such an implementation was 
written to support D-SACK on top of SACK.
So if there is a problem whos fault would it be:
  * The original SACK RFCs for not specifying a mandatory course of
action to take which D-SACK exploits.  Thus making the claim in RFC2883 
unsound.
  * The older linux kernel for not being 100% SACK RFC compliant in its
implementation ?  Not a lot we can do about this now, but if we're able
to identify there maybe backward compatibility issues with the same
implementation thats a useful point to take forward.
  * The newer linux kernel for enabling D-SACK by default when RFC2883
doesn't even claim a cast iron case for D-SACK to be compatible with any
100% RFC compliant SACK implementation.
Does TCP support the concept of vendor dependent options, that would be
TCP options which are in a special range that would both identify the
vendor and the vendors-specific option id.  Such a system would allow
Linux to implement a <D-SACK Ok> option, even if the RFC claims one is
not needed.  This would allow moving forward through this era until such
point in time when it was officially agreed it was just a linux problem 
or an RFC problem.  If its an RFC problem then IANA (or whoever) would 
issue a generic TCP option for it.
If the dump on this problem really does identify a risk/problem when as
its between 2 version of linux a vendor specific option also makes sense.
I don't really want to switch new useful stuff off by default (so it
never gets used), I'm all for experimentation but not to the point of
failure between default configurations of widely distributed version of 
the kernel.
So thats the technical approaches I can come up with to discuss.  Does
Ilpo have a particular vested interest in D-SACK that should be disclosed?

So it is necessary to turn off a TCP option (that is enabled by default)
to be sure to have reliable TCP connections (that don't lock up) in the
bugfree Linux networking stack ?  This is absurd.
If such an option causes such a problem; then that option should not be
enabled by default.  If however the problem is because of a bug then let
us continue to try to isolate the cause rather than wallpaper over the
cracks with the voodoo of turning things that are enabled by default off.
It only makes sense to turn options off when there is a 3rd party
involved (or other means beyond your control) which is affecting
function, the case here is that two Linux kernel stacks are affected and
no 3rd party device has been shown to be affecting function.

I'd thought about that one, its a possibility.  The server in question
does have period of high UDP load on a fair number of UDP sockets at
once (a few 1000).  Both systems have 2Gb of RAM.  The server has maybe
just 250Mb of RSS of all apps combined.

This was my initial stab at the cause, simply due to the sequence like
this (from when the lockup starts) :
03:58:56.731637 IP (tos 0x10, ttl  64, id 53311, offset 0, flags [DF],
proto 6, length: 64) CLIENT.43726 > SERVER.ssh: . [tcp sum ok]
2634113543:2634113543(0) ack 617735600 win 501 <nop,nop,timestamp
819458962 16345815,nop,nop,sack sack 1 {617733440:617734888} >

The client sent a SACK.  But from understanding more about D-SACK, this
is a valid D-SACK response, but it appears to confuse the older Linux
kernel at the server end.

Agreed on this.  However discarding data is allowed (providing it is
intentional discarding not a bug where the TCP stack is discarding 
segments it shouldn't), TCP should recover providing sufficient packets 
get through.
So the SNMP data would show up intentional discards (due to 
memory/resource issues).  So I'll get some of those too.

I noticed this one too, but discarded the "[bad tcp cksum 6662
->ef2b)!]" as bogus on the basis of the following packet turning up at
the client:
03:58:56.422019 IP (tos 0x0, ttl  50, id 28685, offset 0, flags [DF],
proto 6, length: 764) SERVER.ssh > CLIENT.43726: P [tcp sum ok]
617734888:617735600(712) ack 2634113543 win 2728 <nop,nop,timestamp
16345815 819458859>
Forgive me if I am mistaken, but while the server reports a checksum
error, the client did not.  I took this to be a misreporting by tcpdump
at the server, probably due to the "e1000" network card checksum
offloading (I'd guess this level of card does offloading, I've never 
audited the driver before).  If you search both dumps for the timestamps 
"16345815 819458859" two packets were sent by the server and two 
received by the server with those timestamps.

I had thrown up one interpretation of events for others to comment, so
thanks for your comments and viewpoint on the issue.

The SNMP stats aren't so useful right now as
the box has been rebooted since then but I shall attempt to capture
/proc/net/* data, cause the problem, then capture /proc/net/* data again
if those numbers can help.
