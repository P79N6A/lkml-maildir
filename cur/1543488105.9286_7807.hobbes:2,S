This my idea was wrong too. The __only__ object of the HZ/50 timeout is to
cope with merging the ack in the next packet full of data sent very soon.
So it doesn't care how much the network device is fast, but it cares
instead how much the userspace is fast to do a send() after read() is
finished. We can't guess this time in any way and the only clean way to
cope with this is to use a timeout of HZ/50.
The reason before yesterday I am always been against this HZ/50 value is
that you never said me that it's _not_ set in the hope that the other end
then will send us another packet after this one (as I was thinking).
It's instead used to merge the ack with the next send when possible and
that's very important in slowlink like mine (and in the global Internet)
to save a lots of bandwith in iteractive tcp connections.
The side effect of using HZ/50 is that we could have less raw speed
sometimes because we delay the ack even if maybe there's no send() after
the read(). So finally I thought that we could disable delayed acks if
TCP_NODELAY is set. That way the tcp connection will be more responsive as
possible without care about the traffic generated on the underlying
device. I think it's rasonable. TCP_NODELAY don't want the maximal
performance optimization of the network but want the maximal
responsiveness of the tcp connection.
As last thought I think that delacks should not go under HZ/50 of timeout
to always left the receiver to do then a send and merge the ack in the
next data packet.
Setting TCP_NODELAY on the sock Josip should keep the x20 improvement
without losing smartness in normal internet (also maybe offline) usage.
Here my current tree against 2.2.2, it does the thing I thought above:

Comments?
I hope I am not causing wasting time to you if maybe I am thinking or
implementing wrong things.
