i'm quite convinced that the final phase of the genirq conversion will 
work out fine: because it mostly meant the conceptual adoption of your 
ARM IRQ layer (the irqchips approach), with compatibility mechanisms for 
all the other arches, with some minor SMP improvements ontop of it. So 
i'd be surprised if you found _that_ one inadequate :-) If there's any 
detail that ARM doesnt need, i'm sure we can find a non-runtime solution 
for it. But i think i digress.
