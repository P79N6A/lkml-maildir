Only if you insist on replacing them immediately. If you submit a
*small* patch which just adds the new mutexes then a series of small
patches can gradually convert code where mutexes are better. People will
naturally hit the hot and critical points first meaning that in a short
time the users of semaphores will be those who need it, and those who
are not critical to performance.
There is a problemn with init_MUTEX*/DECLARE_MUTEX naming being used for
semaphore struct init and I don't see a nice way to fix that either. I'd
rather see people just have to fix those as compiler errors (or a perl
-e regexp run to make them all init_SEM/DECLARE_SEM before any other
changes are made).
