Hi folks
I know there are quite few IBM ppl here.
I have problem, recently I moved our lotus notes (version 5) server 
from  kernel 2.2 to 2.6, along with hardware changes. But  it looks like 
it  crashes every now and again with:
-

someone/somewhere
Fatal Error signal = 0x0000000b PID/TID = 624/2051
Freezing all server threads ...

No information in log files, nothing. I tried 2.6.6-rc3, 4kb stack, 8kb 
stack, gcc2-95, gcc 3.3, no difference.
It works fine with 2.4.26 thou.
Strange ? I don't know. From my perspective it shouldn't be kernel related.
One more thing, maybe someone knows where can I get incremental upgrade 
from lotus notes server version 5.0.5 for linux to current 5.0.x ? on 
IBM's webpages there is only 5.0.7->...->5.0.12.
