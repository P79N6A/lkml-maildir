Maybe I'm mixed up but I thought the K6 didn't have anything like mmx, 
But the 3DNow instructions set in the -2 and -3 version was AMD's 
alternative to mmx.
And the Athlon was just adding an extra instruction set which is similar
to Intel SIMD implementation.
I think I can guess that what you actually mean is that gcc only has two
AMD style options.
-march=k6 means k6 without any mmx-stlye instructions
-march=k7 means Athlon with mmx and SIMD style instruction
ie not differentiation between the k6 vanilla and the k6-2 and -3.
Is that the problem?
Shame there's not a -march=mmx alternative which covers both 
pentium MMX, K6-2, and K6-3.  Though I suppose the instructions 
sets are different so this would cause a problem.
What about -march=3dnow???  Would that be more plausible?
