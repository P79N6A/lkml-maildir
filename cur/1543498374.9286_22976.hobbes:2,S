Hi guys,
It is tempting to express an opinion in hope that it may serve to cause
more agreement amongst brethren than strife.
I think, although it would be much desireable to avoid every possible
profane word in the Kernel Source (because for every word, each of us will
be asked to account for soon, and because the little ones read the
Source for edification and not for corruption), what is far more important
is that we do not waste Linus' time with such "cleanup-patches" (as I did
in the past :) - instead send your "mouth-wash-with-soap" patches to the
maintainers of corresponding subsystems. This approach solves two
problems:
a) Linus said he will only accept that kind of patches this way only.
b) You point out the infirmities to the person most likely to have caused
them instead of to the whole world, or even worse to Linus who I do not
recall being ever haste to utter an unworthy word.
(and because if thy brother offends against thee chastise him privately
and not before the entire congregation!) 
Regards,
