Thank you for your reply.
I have created these patches (no_pci_serial and no_pci_mem) because I got 
some errors (missing ixp4xx_pci_write/read)
when I tried to compile kernel for ixp4xx without pci bus support. Now, I 
tried it again and got clean build. I think I had to forget
to do make clean before...

inb/outb/readb/writeb methods have nothing to do with the presence of
a PCI bus or not, so the patch is wrong - and it actually breaks a lot
of machine implementations which use this.
