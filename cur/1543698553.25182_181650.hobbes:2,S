Bingo...just the perfect excuse I need to give to my manager to keep
a low profile while tinkering around for a long time :)
Okay, so I will play a wee bit more the devil's advocate as an 
exercise of futility, if you don't mind. Just trying to compile a 
(possibly incomplete) quick list of what would be needed, can you 
guys help me? you know way more than I do:
1) the core kernel needs to be independent of physical memory position
1.1) same with drivers/subsystems
1.2) filesystems
[it cannot be really incomplete because I have added all the code :/]
Oh well, forget it, that's more than enough. Another project for the
stack of interesting things to work on.
Thanks to all
