<ahem>  Watch out for overgeneralization.  I'm a programmer that also does 
technical writing.  My forte is industry standards, but I do a fair amount 
in other areas.
For example, I just got my copy of _Linux IP Stacks Commentary_ (co-written 
with H.B.J.Clifford, long time associate and partner in crime) in from 
Coriolis, nine months of reverse-engineering the TCP/IP stack in kernel 2.0.34.
As soon as the core network implementation in Linux appears to have settled 
in 2.3.x, I'll be starting the technical work on the second edition of the 
commentary with the target of having a version of the Commentary available 
based on 2.4.0 final code on the Web once Linus is comfortable with the 
release and I can complete the reverse-engineering.  Publishing the first 
hack on the Web means less delay from completion of a section to making it 
available to the readers.
(And before you ask, Coriolis isn't paying anything for the follow-on work 
until the Second Edition is commissioned -- it's all off my own time and my 
own dime until then, absent any funding source I can find on my own.)
