Linux really does it (arch/i386/kernel/entry.S).

Linux does it (sys_idle()).
BHs are really perfect soft timer, you need only raise some BH bit
and hook a handler.

Exactly.

Yes. The problem is that when one process is running not making
syscalls, the generator stops completely falling back to timer.
It means that pure soft timer is inappropriate for real time tasks
(including one, which this thread was started from). Variable resolution
timer is the only solution and, after it will be implemented,
soft timers will be fully useless.
Actually, in softnet I removed all the traces of this "softtimer"
approach. 8)8) qdiscs are kicked only by events on scheduled device
and by real time timer.
