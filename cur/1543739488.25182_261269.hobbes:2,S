Subject: 2.6.9-rc3 and rc4: parallel printer has gone

After upgrading kernel 2.6.7 to 2.6.9-rc3 my parallel printer can't be found 
anymore. Same situation with rc4. The .config file is the same as for 2.6.7. 
Starting kernel 2.6.7 makes printer available again. Printer is a Brother HL 
1430, which never made troubles before. Bios is set to ECP/EPP.
