Any chance that you can get a full oops, with register info? Right now 
your errors only have the call trace, not the registers or the EIP 
itself..
If that's because it scrolled off the screen, one option is to use the 
extended VGA modes or fbcon to make the screen area bigger.. Or use a 
serial console..
