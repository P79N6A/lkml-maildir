I also tryied Q3A demo and i got similar values to yours:
CFS		90
2.6.22	90
SD		90
while running that endless loop, on 2.6.22 and SD it drops instantly to 4 fps.
While CFS runs ~70 with 1.9 load. I was able to play the game without noticing 
much degradation. I written these values while playing under CFS:
load fps
1.66	81
1.73	75
1.97	70s
With this patch [1] someone sent me over IRC i get similar values to CFS, 
maybe a few fps more, but thats insignificant and not very accurate to 
measure. Anyway with this patch i am playing with a load of 2.2 at ~75 fps, 
1024x768 windowed. It's enjoyable to frag the dumb 'Major'  as under CFS. 
I think the main difference in performance of CFS and SD it's the 
implementation of sched_yield (which is used by graphic drivers) and CFS has 
changed the implementation of sched_yield. You use:
in mainline (2.6.22): 
/**
 * sys_sched_yield - yield the current processor to other threads.
 *
 * This function yields the current CPU by moving the calling thread
 * to the expired array. If there are no other threads running on this
 * CPU then this function will return.
 */
you changed it to something like:
if (unlikely(rq->nr_running == 1))
                schedstat_inc(rq, yld_act_empty);
        else
                current->sched_class->yield_task(rq, current);
wile mainline (2.6.22) and SD use:
dequeue_task(current, array);
enqueue_task(current, target);
and
requeue_task()
Anyway i am going to continue to frag a bit more :)

There are 2 modes for this hack:
sysctl kernel.sched_yield = 1 or 2, see patch.
