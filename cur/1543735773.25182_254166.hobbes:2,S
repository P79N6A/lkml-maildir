The driver almost always needs to go to user space to get the file of
mode line overrides that the user can create. But there is nothing
stopping you from building everything in the kernel.
I'd just rather not have 100K of resident code waiting around for
something that doesn't occur very often.  For the radeon sample I'm
working on I have moved everything to user space except for a couple
of small helper functions that directly play with the registers. Note
that all mode setting in X occurs completely in user space so you
can't argue that it can't be done.
