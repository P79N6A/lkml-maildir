howdy,
In /proc/stat the record as
page x y 
which indicates cumulative page in and out values.
To my best undertstanding this info is stored in 
kstat.pgpgin and kstat.pgpgout.
However the values are incremented in submit_bh in
ll_rw_blk.c. So are we actually counting the buffers
we write in and out or the pages; or is it the same ?
thanks
Ravi
