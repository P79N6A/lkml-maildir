   I dont share your pessimistic view of nfs development in linux. I do
agree that it is important for a bigger linux acceptance in most
companies, but the current state is not bad, on the contrary. You have
working nfs v2, both as a client and a server. Nfs v3 is also available,
both as a client and a server, thanks to Trond Myklebust hard work, even
though i wouldnt put my hands in the fire for the server part. You talk
about nfs-interoperability with AIX, Irix and Sun. It exists, also. I have
Linux working as a nfs server for more than a dozen Sgi & Ibm
workstations, with heavy locking usage, without many complaints (not
perfect, but then, what is). Now, you ask me, what is the secret? I will
tell you - i have a coleague that once said to me - "its all about sex,
man, all about sex". Now i will reformulate it, and maybe even ask for a
patent on it - "its all about patches, man, all about patches". You need
the right ones, and fast. That gets us to the main problem here. Why arent
they in the stable kernel already? Well, i ask myself the same question
regarding nfs v2. Its something long due. I am waiting for 2.2.11 kernel
with hopes it will be included, even though i have yet to see the changes
list (i use 2.2.7, btw). Nfs v3 is a different beast. I think it needs to
be coded in a different way in order to be allowed in the kernel tree. It
will be done, i am sure, but it will take time.
Tell me what you need, where are you having problems. I will try to help
you.

Pedro Rodrigues
