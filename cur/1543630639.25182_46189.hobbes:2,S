Understood.  BK doesn't work that way for multiple reasons, some which have
to do with how it synchronizes replicas, and some which have to do with
being able to reproduce a tree exactly.
It's probably best if you simply view this as a BK limitation which isn't
going away any time soon and don't put junk changesets in the middle of
your stream of changes.  It's easy enough to export the change you want
as a patch, export the comments in the form that bk comments wants,
undo the junk changeset, import the patch, and set the comments.  Yeah,
it's awkward; consider that a feedback loop which encourages you to
think a bit more about what you put in the tree.
