Yes. We first revoke the file descriptors under tasklist_lock after which 
any new operations on the revoked inode descriptors fail.

Yeah, filesystem dependent. Writes are not a problem as do_sync() will 
wait until the writers are done. For that part, generic_file_revoke() 
should be fine although suboptimal for most filesystems.

That's bad. Can we perhaps wait until readers are done?

You use revoke() (with chown, for example) to gain exclusive access to 
an inode that might be in use by other processes. This means that we must 
mke sure that:
  - operations on opened file descriptors pointing to that inode fail
  - there are no shared mappings visible to other processes
  - in-progress system calls are either completed (writes) or abort 
    (reads)
After revoke() system call returns, you are guaranteed to have revoked 
access to an inode for any processes that had access to it when you 
started the operation. The caller is responsible for blocking any future 
open(2) calls that might occur while revoke() takes care of fork(2) and 
dup(2) during the operation.

Good point. We would need to take down those too.
