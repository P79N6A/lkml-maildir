I'm resending this , since the last mail never appeared on 
the mail-list archive at www.tux.org and I got no responses either.
So , I upgraded my 2.0.x system to a 2.2.x kernel ( 2.2.2-pre4 ).
I selected modules support , no symbol versioning and kmod.
I forgot to remove kerneld ( 2.1.121 ) from my rc scripts,
but discovered that it works OK.
The modules are loaded on demand and removed after use.
Is this normal ?
Can I continue to use kerneld and remove kmod from kernel ?
Any other comment ?
