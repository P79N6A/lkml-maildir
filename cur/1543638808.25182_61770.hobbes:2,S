If you'll bother with reading code, you'll find that dma status
is reported after:
(dma_stat & 7) != 4 ? (0x10 | dma_stat) : 0;
Because of same code is used in your 2.4.x ide-dma.c (at least in
2.4.19-rc5), I'm really happy that now I know that you are really 
familiar with your code.
Code ORs read value with 0x10 to make sure that it reports non-zero
value when error happens (when chip returs dma_stat == 0x00). And 0x10 
was choosen because of this bit should be always zero, as you know.
Maybe we should print value after ANDing with 0xEF, but why? Everybody
can read code when in doubt.
