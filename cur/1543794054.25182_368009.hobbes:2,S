 Hello,
   I'd like to ask a few questions about the kernel RTC infrastructure.
 Actually, it seems that each different RTC driver is working on is own:
 drivers/char/ds1286.c
 drivers/char/genrtc.c
 drivers/char/ip27-rtc.c
 drivers/char/rtc.c
 drivers/input/misc/hp_sdc_rtc.c
 are all self-contained RTC drivers.
 The situation is a slightly better on ARM, where
 arch/arm/common/rtctime.c
 contains common RTC registration code (register_rtc(...)).
 Has an interface like the ARM one been pondered for the whole
 kernel?
 Could it be used as the standard kernel RTC interface?
 Thanks!
