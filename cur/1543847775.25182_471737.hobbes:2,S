I should underline that cache miss is a result of invalidating of cache
line with __warn_once in each other CPUs performed by hw for cache
coherence.
__warn_once is a common data. It is costly to test-and-modify it just in
SMP. But it is not costly to write to the variable in memory just after
reading it. As a compiler have understood source code. 
A read-and-modify for common variable are performed under lock usually.

That would be nice, but I don't know of one (apart from "volatile", 
which has its own downsides).  Once could imagine an annotation which 
makes gcc consider writes to the variable relatively expensive, so that 
it avoids generating unnecessary/excessive writes.
