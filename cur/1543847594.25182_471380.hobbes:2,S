Hi Dave,
My recollection is that it used to default to on, it was disabled
because it needs to map the buffer into a single contiguous chunk
of kernel memory. This was placing a lot of pressure on the memory
remapping code, so we made it not default to on as reworking the
code to deal with non contig memory was looking like a major
effort.
