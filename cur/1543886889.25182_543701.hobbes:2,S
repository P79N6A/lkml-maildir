yeah - that's why "hard RT" apps generally either preallocate all memory 
in advance, or use special, deterministic allocators. And for "soft RT" 
it's all a matter of degree.

only if it can be done without slowing down all the much more important 
uses of the MM semaphore.

it could be measured, but it's certainly not going to be zero.

on mainline? It can get arbitrarily large (read: seconds) in essence.
