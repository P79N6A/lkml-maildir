Please be precise, the "for most kernel developers" part is important.
In most situations this guideline is more than enough:
- if you need fast and simple timer, use normal timer
- if you need higher resolution, use hrtimer
Only if you want to push the timer system to its limits, you have to take 
the corner cases into account. I consider lifetime issues an advanced 
topic of timer programming, which Joe Kernelhacker doesn't has to be 
overly concerned about (it worked quite well so far).
bye, Roman
