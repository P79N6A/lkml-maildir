The includes were moved from drivers/infiniband a few weeks ago for
various good reasons.
I really wish you had replied to the initial RFC
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/4/191
) or the merge where the headers
were actually moved (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/29/105
).  I don't
think there's much point in moving the files back now.
