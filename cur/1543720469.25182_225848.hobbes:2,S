Indeed its likely.

Ah, your test output is a bit confusing (changes to __const_udealy
affect the output of my_udelay), but I think I understand it. Forgive me
if I miss-interpret.

This does make a good bit of difference! Good catch!

This change looks right to me.

I agree w/ Pavel that rounding up sounds better, but I can't get the
math to work, so this may be the best solution. 
I'm also spinning up a patch w/ these changes to test, let me know how
your testing went and I'll do the same.
