I have not been able to get the memory hole turned off at the 16M mark
Going through some of the Documentation files, I noticed that I can specify 
a ram map with the mem boot option. I know the mem=768M hasn't worked, so 
what about trying the memory map option? Could that be a solution to my 
problem? If so, what would be the proper way to put the command?
As well I have downloaded the 2.4.18 kernel and in the latest distro of 
Slackware, 10.1, it doesn't want to compile, I can't remember the exact 
error, but it was referenced back to one of the asm headers as the problem. 
I will dig that error up and maybe post based on that to get that kernel 
running.
As well, going to a 2.6 kernel just in not overly feasable at this time as 
it takes 24 hrs to compile with the state the machine is in right now.
