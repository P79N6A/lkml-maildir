That seems like a reasonable requirement, but would it be possible to
do the capability check at open() time, rather than when the operation
is performed? That would be more consistent with how conventional
permissions checks on files/devices work, and would avoid breaking
privilege-dropping applications.
I don't really want to run my CD-writing tool with CAP_SYS_RAWIO all
the time -- if it's got a security hole that a malicious CD image can
exploit, then I'd rather it were just able to damage the CD drive than
the rest of the system...
Thanks,
