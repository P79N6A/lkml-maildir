The reason the Access Layer runs in both kernel and user space is to
support
both kernel and user-mode infiniband clients. For example, in kernel
mode a 
SCSI (SRP) or IPoIB driver would use the Access Layer services. In user
space, a
middleware library, such as DAPL, would use the user-mode access layer
to 
access the infiniband fabric.
