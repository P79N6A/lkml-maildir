- From looking at the source, it would seem that a few drivers will need
to be modified for this, but if the others were as easy to modify as
mine, there will be no problems (I did have a vauge look for some
common mixer code that might affect lots of cards at once, but I
didn't see it immediately and I don't have any other cards to test it
on, so I decided to leave well alone)
I'm running an ISA AWE64 Value (so it uses the Sb16 code) on RedHat
6.0. I edited /usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/sb_mixer.c and on line 164
(in the "static int sb_default_levels" structure) I made the following
change:
- -  0x5a5a,                     /* Master Volume */
+  0x0000,                       /* Master Volume */
(Woo! My first bit of kernel hacking ;)
It seems to work fine here (which is lucky 'cos when I rebooted to
test it, I had 	hit the maximal mount count for all my partitions, so
I was saved an ear bashing :)
The only problem I can forsee with making this permenant code change
is that during an initial install of Linux (I'm only familiar with
RedHat's installer), unless the installer calls a userspace mixer
settings program, people will not hear any test sounds played and will
think their sound card is broken. Perhaps the sound modules should
have an extra parameter for specifying if everything should be muted
or not?
