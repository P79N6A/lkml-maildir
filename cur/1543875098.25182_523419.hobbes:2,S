out_mem:
        while (nba--)
                blk_cleanup_queue(loop_dev[nba]->lo_queue);
        while (nbl--) {
                put_disk(loop_dev[nbl]->lo_disk);
                kfree(loop_dev[nbl]);
        }
        if (loop_dev_vmalloced)
                vfree(loop_dev);
        else
                kfree(loop_dev);
        unregister_blkdev(LOOP_MAJOR, "loop");
What is ugly in this code ?
