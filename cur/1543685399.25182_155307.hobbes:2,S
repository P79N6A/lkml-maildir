Hi,
I think you can try out the nss_ldap rpm at
http://na.uni-tuebingen.de/~frohlich/nss_ldap/
It is built on RedHat 9.
The main target of this rpm is to eliminate the recursive entrance bug of 
nss_ldap if the ldap host is not resolved before entering the ldap nss 
modules gethostbyname. But there is also some threading cleanup included.
I don't know what the real reason of the reported problem is, but it does not 
occur since the time i use my patched nss_ldap module.
I use both kinds of kernels with redhat 9 vanilla kernel.org and redhat 
modified ones.
 Hope this helps
