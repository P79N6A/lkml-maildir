Subject: [PATCH] md: Remove unnecessary printk when raid5 gets an unaligned read.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

One more... (sorry about the dribs-and-drabs approach)

### Comments for Changeset
raid5_mergeable_bvec tries to ensure that raid5 never sees a read
request that does not fit within just one chunk.  However as we
must always accept a single-page read, that is not always possible.
So when "in_chunk_boundary" fails, it might be unusual, but it is not
a problem and printing a message every time is a bad idea.
