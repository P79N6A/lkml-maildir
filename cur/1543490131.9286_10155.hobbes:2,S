This is possible:
Since you have two shift keys that both may or may not
be down, the kernel does
	k_down[value]++;
upon keypress, and
	if (k_down[value])
		k_down[value]--;
upon key release.
If somehow the release was missed once, you have a stuck key.
However, the key down array is recomputed on various occasions,
like when loadkeys (more precisely, the KDSKBENT ioctl) is
executed *and something actually changes*, or when you do
"kbd_mode -a", so i should be possible to get out of this
without a reboot or so.
