I'm working with a block device driver. If I try to
write into the device using the block_write function
and I read after with block_read the behaviour is
fine. I can flush the buffers and the driver works ok.
But if I make a ext2 file system on the device I have
problems. If I copy one file to the new file system
and after I compare the two file, the command doesnt
give any diferences, but when I flush the buffers and
the cache pages the cp command gives me a lot of
differences. If I only flush the cache pages it works
fine.
I dont know if I'm forgetting something respect the
way the ext2 file system works.
I hope help. Thanks.
