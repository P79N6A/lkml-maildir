Because, the following patch didn't hit -mm. :)

	All checks in sys_utime() and do_utimes() are duplicated as well as a
	comment. sys_utime() will now use do_utimes() after getting times from
	userspace and projecting them to struct timeval [2].
Nevermind.

I don't know. Compat syscall -- I'm not touching it. Normal syscall --
time_t is long on all archs, suseconds_t is sometimes int, but we're
putting zero there.

It passed utime tests in December's LTP.
