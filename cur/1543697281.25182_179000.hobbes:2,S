You should have a vm_ops->nopage() method that didn't get updated.
The formerly-unused argument got turned into a status return pointer,
so you need to do something like:
struct page *vmmon_nopage(struct vm_area_struct *vma, unsigned long addr, int *type)
{
	...
	if (type)
		*type = VM_FAULT_MINOR;
	return page;
}
It should also give off a big fat warning about initialization from
incompatible pointer types when compiled.
