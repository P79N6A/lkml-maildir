The symptoms have occured on a Gigabyte 7-ZX-1 and a 7-VX-1.  I have a bit
of a suspicion that the 250W power supplies aren't enough for it, but won't
be able to check this until after LWE.

This isn't 5 seconds in a month or two like my old K6-III/EPoX MVP3-G
setup.  This is 10 minutes every 9-12 hours.  When I woke up this morning,
my clock was off by 15 minutes.  That's a bit abnormal

Very much so.  I'll have to wait until I can get a DOS boot disk, though,
since flashing doesn't work well in Linux ;)

No GPM.  Logitech PS/2 mouse with imps2.  Microsoft Intelli PS/2 mouse does
the same.
