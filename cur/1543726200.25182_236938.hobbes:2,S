I now have a computer with an ALPS touchpad, and your patch works
better than the old patch, even though there are some issues.
Auto-detection works:
        alps.c: E6 report: 00 00 64
        alps.c: E7 report: 73 02 0a
        alps.c: E6 report: 00 00 64
        alps.c: E7 report: 73 02 0a
        alps.c: Status: 15 01 0a
        ALPS Touchpad (Glidepoint) detected
          Disabling hardware tapping
        alps.c: Status: 11 01 0a
        input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS TouchPad on isa0060/serio4
However, fast double taps are no longer detected. The second tap is
simply ignored. I added this printk:
	printk("time:%lu x:%3d y:%3d z:%3d %d%d%d %d%d%d %d%d%d\n",
	       jiffies, x, y, z,
	       (packet[0] & 0x04) != 0, (packet[0] & 0x02) != 0, (packet[0] & 0x01) != 0,
	       (packet[2] & 0x04) != 0, (packet[2] & 0x02) != 0, (packet[2] & 0x01) != 0,
	       (packet[3] & 0x04) != 0, (packet[3] & 0x02) != 0, (packet[3] & 0x01) != 0);
to alps_process_packet() and made some tests:
A single tap gives:
        time:2836613 x:469 y:445 z: 16 111 010 000
        time:2836714 x:469 y:445 z:  0 111 000 000
Note that taps always generate z==16, and they always appear to be
100ms long. Apparently the touchpad firmware is still trying to be
clever instead of just reporting the measured x/y/z values.
Unfortunately a fast double tap generates exactly the same response.
The second tap is not detected.
A slightly longer tap (>100ms I think) gives:
        time:2947819 x:575 y:466 z: 79 111 010 000
        time:2947911 x:575 y:466 z: 52 111 010 000
        time:2947931 x:575 y:466 z:  0 111 000 000
        time:2947991 x:575 y:466 z: 16 111 010 000
        time:2948092 x:575 y:466 z:  0 111 000 000
This gets translated to a double click by the X driver (assuming
FingerHigh<16), even though I only tapped once.
If I hold the finger even longer on the pad before releasing it
(>~180ms I think), the touchpad reports:
        time:3180578 x:656 y:432 z: 78 111 010 000
        time:3180728 x:656 y:432 z: 71 111 010 000
        time:3180737 x:656 y:432 z: 42 111 010 000
        time:3180746 x:656 y:432 z:  0 111 000 000
Now it doesn't try to be clever, and instead reports the true x/y/z
values.
I tried the windows driver, and it correctly detects fast double taps,
which makes me think it is not using the "hardware tapping off" mode.
Therefore, it made some tests with hardware tapping enabled.
A short single tap now gives:
        time:3850310 x:574 y:402 z:  0 111 001 000
        time:3850410 x:574 y:402 z:  0 111 000 000
Ie, z==0 but the gesture bit is set to 1 for 100ms.
A fast double tap gives:
        time:3951723 x:589 y:359 z:  0 111 001 000
        time:3951865 x:589 y:359 z:  0 111 000 000
        time:3951883 x:617 y:354 z:  0 111 001 000
        time:3951905 x:617 y:354 z:  0 111 000 000
which is good, since it no longer looks identical to a single tap.
A longer tap gives:
        time:4161527 x:506 y:480 z: 90 111 010 000
        time:4161560 x:506 y:480 z: 68 111 010 000
        time:4161579 x:506 y:480 z:  0 111 000 000
So, it looks like it would be enough to convert the gesture bit to
some sufficiently large Z value. However, that's not enough, because a
tap-and-drag (touch-release-touch-drag-release) operation gives:
        time:4221184 x:502 y:444 z:  0 111 001 000
        time:4221312 x:542 y:365 z: 73 111 011 000
        time:4221324 x:540 y:368 z: 74 111 011 000
        ...
        time:4221543 x:511 y:419 z: 24 111 011 000
        time:4221554 x:511 y:419 z:  0 111 001 000
        time:4221577 x:511 y:419 z:  0 111 000 000
Note that there is no indication from the hardware that the finger was
released and then touched again between the first and second lines.
This case can be handled too by the driver, by detecting when the
state changes from "!fin && ges" to "fin && ges". With that logic
added, the driver can undo most of the damage caused by hardware tap
emulation, but sometimes there are delays between state changes which
I haven't completely understood yet. Setting MaxTapTime >= 210 in the
X driver seems to make it work quite well though.
The above analysis leads to the patch below. The static variable
obviously has to go in the final version. This patch is only to
illustrate the logic/ugliness needed to make my touchpad behave
reasonably.
