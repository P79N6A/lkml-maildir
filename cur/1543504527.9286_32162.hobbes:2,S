I've asserted CORRECTLY that certain faulty VFAT behaviour is a
security issue. I've made no claims whatsoever about FAT behaviour,
since the said issue doesn't exist in any of the FAT based fs's other
than VFAT.

So if one installs Linux with a VFAT partition for the root directory,
one won't have any security problems? If you believe that, then I've
500 acres of prime farmland in the middle of the Sahara desert that
you're sure to be interested in!!!

If you wish to waffle about why acknowledged security issues aren't
security issues, you have that right. Just don't expect any sane
person to pay much attention.

If you want to restrict "security issues" to just one aspect thereof,
again, you have the right. Deletion of files is probably the LEAST
worrysome security issue though. I for one would be far more worried
about people READING files they shouldn't than about them DELETING
files, since several of the systems I maintain contain lots of stuff
that falls in the "Highly Confidential" category.
Since you've made it quite clear that you intend to keep redefining
terms so you can deny the truth, I won't waste any more of my time
responding to your comments...
Best wishes from Riley.
