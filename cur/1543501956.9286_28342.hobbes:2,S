Why ? It's MUCH more easy to write and support such patches then to write and
support windows-style "separate module" for Windows which will patch kernel
in memory on the fly :-))

You can write patch with easy... And you can write module as well with
technique borrowed from windows toys: kernel patching in memory...
It's just non-practical in case of Linux since there are just a few
Windows kernel but A LOT OF linux kernels (there are more Windows kernels
then official Windows releases but still not as many as different Linux
kernels -- if you'll count all possibilities including usage of different
compilers, different compiler options, etc :-)

And you know what ? Thay can not be implemented in Windows without evil
patching the kernel as well :-)) Just there you must patch binary-only kernel
without sources on the fly in memory (it's not theory -- I seen code for
some of this toys). And this way is not practical for Linux: there are contless
combinations of compilers/compiler flags...

Yes. And when our patches are finally fixed M$ drivers still do not work
as expected... And I STILL can not use Delphi4 due crash in video driver :-((

No. Adding new feature to Linux is more easy then addign new feature to Windows.
We have completely other problem: most nice toys from winfiles.com are not
interested to hackers with enough skills to implement them and users who want
them do not have enough skills...
