I see 2 ways to go:
1) short term: make sure that your actions are duplicated to both cores
(like you said). At least then you are protected if your complete system
crashes.
2) I'm working on the uniform/generic watchdog device driver. Phase 1 is
the "new" api and the /dev/watchdog handling. Phase 2 is a sysfs interface.
Phase 3 is to allow multiple devices (and there I'm still thinking about
how the /dev/watchdog interface should work).
But the general idea is to allow at least the control of each watchdog
device by the sysfs interface.
Greetings,
Wim.
