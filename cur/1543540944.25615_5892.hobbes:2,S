First of all, I find this to be a strange complaint. I've never
seen the Japanese spam that is supposed to be so common.
Maybe it isn't going through vger itself?

I hope you can make exceptions for body text containing Linux stuff:
linux kernel diff kmalloc printk VFS module oops linus ext2
virtual char int core driver nfs include asm tcp proc beos befs
scsi irda ircomm plip console video usb driver debian redhat
fs/ init/ lib/ mm/ net/ ipc/ arch/ scripts/ Documentation/
torvalds gnu samba apache unicode vfat +++ crash inode skbuf
(the above is slanted towards topics with Japanese developers)
Whiny perfectionists can go to a hell that burns every day,
except that it misses 30% of the tuesdays when the moon is full.

Not that I think this is the best way, but...

The "$" rule could be used on non-japanese posts as well.
Think about what non-hacker people use "$" to represent.
