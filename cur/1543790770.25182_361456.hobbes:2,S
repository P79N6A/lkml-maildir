Yes, that's one reason why I introduced ptep_set_access_flags() to be
used when relaxing access permissions to a PTE.

Note that we should really pass more than just "write_access" from the
arch code. We could make good use of "execute" in some cases as well,
also knowing wether this is a real fault or the result of
get_user_pages() (in some case, the former could use more agressive TLB
pre-loading, not the later). Finally, those infos should be passed to
update_mmu_cache().
