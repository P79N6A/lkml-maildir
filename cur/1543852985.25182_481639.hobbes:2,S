I'd prefer that you just freeze the filesystem and let the
filesystem do things correctly.

AFAIK, its the I/O completion workqueues that are causing problems.
(fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_buf.c) However, thinking about it, I'm not
sure that the work queues being left unfrozen is the real problem.
i.e. after a sync there's still I/O outstanding (e.g. metadata in
the log but not on disk), and because the kernel threads are frozen
some time after the sync, we could have issued this delayed write
metadata to disk after the sync. With XFS, we can have a of queue of
thousands of metadata buffers for delwri, and they are all issued
async and can take many seconds for the I/O to complete.
The I/O completion workqueues will continue to run until all I/O
stops, and metadata I/O completion will change the state of the
filesystem in memory.
However, even if you stop the workqueue processing, you're still
going to have to wait for all I/O completion to occur before
snapshotting memory because having any I/O complete changes memory
state.  Hence I fail to see how freezing the workqueues really helps
at all here....
Given that the only way to track and block on these delwri metadata
buffers is to issue a sync flush rather than a async flush, suspend
has to do something different to guarantee that we block until all
those I/Os have completed. i.e. freeze the filesystem.
So the problem, IMO, is suspend is not telling the filesystem
to stop doing stuff and so we are getting caught out by doing
stuff that suspend assumes won't happen but does nothing
to prevent.

This is incorrect.  Freezing an XFS filesystem _ensures_ that log
replay occurs on thaw or a failed resume.  XFS specifically dirties
the log after a freeze down to a consistent state so that the
unlinked inode lists get processed by recovery on thaw/next mount.
Cheers,
Dave.
