Solved with new ppp. Thanks, and sorry.
---------------------------------------
My modems (Courier 28.8 external, Actiontec PCI call waiting non-winmodem)
connect to the Internet fine with 2.4.0, and broke around 2.4.1. What
happens is they dial out, make those sounds, and just as they seem to be
about to connect, they disconnect. I'm pretty sure both kernels are
configured correctly. This still occurs with kernel 2.4.6.
