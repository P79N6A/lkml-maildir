Hi Nathan,
Cache issues may explain this. When 2 processes are allocating
memory in parallel they'll be given different interleavings of
pages which could explain the speedup.
Start one process, get it to memset all its memory, then pause
it and do the same thing. Then set them both running at the same
time (ie. after they've each touched their memory in turn), what
do you see?
(By memset()ing the memory, you'll cause the kernel to actually
allocate a physical page. By doing that one after the other, we
hope to eliminate interleaving issues.)
