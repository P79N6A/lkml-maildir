While the basic idea is attractive for a number of reasons, there are more 
than a few questions to answer.  Take a look at a typical proc function, 
meminfo_read_proc for example.  Its active ingredient is basically a sprintf 
function:
        len += sprintf(page+len,
                "MemTotal:     %8lu kB\n"
                "MemFree:      %8lu kB\n"
                "MemShared:    %8lu kB\n"
		...,
                K(i.totalram),
                K(i.freeram),
                K(i.sharedram),
		...);
What does the equivalent look like under your scheme?   Does it remain 
localized in one proc routine, or does it get spread out over a few 
locations, possibibly with a part of the specification outside the 
kernel?  Do the titles end up in your dotfile?  How do you specify whatever 
formatting is necessary to transform a dotfile into normal /proc output?  Is 
this transformation handled in user space or the kernel?  How much library 
support is needed?
