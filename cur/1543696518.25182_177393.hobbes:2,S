Sure. With the old int 0x80 calling convention, the syscall number
is just put into the EAX register which can contain 32 bits. There
may be some mask on the kernel side to limit 'damage', but you
can change this if you are adding system-calls. The newer calling
convention also has just the 32 bit limitation.
Cheers,
