So the in-core accounting has underflowed by a small amount but the
on disk accounting is correct.
We've had a few reports of this that I know of over the past couple of years,
but we've never managed to find a reproducable test case for it.
Can you describe what benchmark you were runnin, wht kernel you were
using and whether any of the tests hit  an ENOSPC condition?
Also, in future can you cc xfs@oss.sgi.com on XFS bug reports?
Cheers,
Dave.
