It was not created for that (I know that because I created it ;-)
X86_GENERIC is merely an optimization hint (currently it only changes the cache

that handles correctness is checked unconditionally.
is_prefetch is a correctness thing.

Now that's becomming silly. It's alttogether only a few KB and all
__init code anyways.
