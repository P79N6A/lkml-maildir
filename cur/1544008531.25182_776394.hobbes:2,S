Unless the SATA controller has the plug interrupt (very few have), there 
is no way for the kernel to detect that an old SATA disk was unplugged and 
a new one was plugged in.
So the answer is that the admin must not hot-swap disk unless unmounting 
the filesystem or notifying the RAID layer about it. If you hot-swap 
softraid1/4/5 disk, you definitely damage data, because the softraid layer 
has no way to find out about the hotswap.
