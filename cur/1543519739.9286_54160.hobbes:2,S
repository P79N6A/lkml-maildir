Ah, good to know that. I'll check what we are doing elsewhere.

I mis-spoke slightly. What we have is a filesystem and a device
masquerading as a filesystem (kind of plan9-ish concept).

I was mostly looking at the existing standard functions and using
the ones that seem appropriate. Then implemeting the pieces that
they call.

Thanks for the info. I'll probably have more questions later...
