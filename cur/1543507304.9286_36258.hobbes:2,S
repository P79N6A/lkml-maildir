Hi,
I would like to report success in modifying the tulip.c version 91g to
work with linux kernel 2.3.14 and above, I have tested it on my home
network by transferring linux-2.3.12.tar.bz2 from one system on my
network to my development system which is using the tulip driver. 
The first time I tried to transfer the kernel it stalled (the tulip
dropped off the network) at 7.5Mb transferred (at over 700kbps) I did
ifconfig eth0 down and ifconfig eth0 up right after .. telnetted some,
sent some email ftpd some more and tried to ftp the linux-2.3.12.tar.bz2
again .. this time success, again the speed is over 700kbps.
So it works for me :-)
Since the driver is over 100kb (39kb gzipped) I'm not attaching it here,
If you want to try it, it can be optained through ftp:
ftp://saraber.dhs.org/pub/tulip/
I have the tulip.c, a gzipped version and a patch against the tulip v91g
from 
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html
 up there. I
have made it clear in the header of the file and the startup banner that
I'm the one who modified the file, so please don't send any nasty
bugreports to Donald or the linux-tulip list without verifying that the
bug exsists in the original tulip driver as well.
I would also like to thank Richard Dynes [rdynes@sun1.varcom.com] and
Jonathan A. George [jageorge@att.net] for their help with the tulip
driver.
ps. if you can't ftp I'd be glad to email the driver to you..
Regards,
Gerard Saraber
