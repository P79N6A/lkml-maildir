I did post a patch - it basically fixes up the includes to not use
KERNELD_NEW_PROTOCOL (as 2.0 uses the 'old' protocol, and 2.2 doesn't use
kerneld at all). It also added some diagnostic to check you weren't doing
anything silly based on your kerneld config & kernel version.
I posted it to linux-kernel (Jan 19?) and cc'd to the last person listed in
the modutils ChangeLog, and was rewarded by deafening silence :)
