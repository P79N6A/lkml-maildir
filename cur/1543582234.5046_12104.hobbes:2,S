If you try
strings vmlinux|grep /usr
you get a bunch of strings like:
..
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/io.h
..
One other couple of Kb. The problem is not that, but the string comes from:
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/io.h:
..(line 110)
/*
 * Temporary debugging check to catch old code using
 * unmapped ISA addresses. Will be removed in 2.4.
 */
#if 1
  extern void *__io_virt_debug(unsigned long x, const char *file, int line);
  extern unsigned long __io_phys_debug(unsigned long x, const char *file, int li
ne);
  #define __io_virt(x) __io_virt_debug((unsigned long)(x), __FILE__, __LINE__)
//#define __io_phys(x) __io_phys_debug((unsigned long)(x), __FILE__, __LINE__)
#else
  #define __io_virt(x) ((void *)(x))
//#define __io_phys(x) __pa(x)
#endif
..
As you see, it was not removed in 2.4...
