Subject: [PATCH] reverse pci config space restore order
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

According to Intel ICH spec, there are several rules that
Base Address should be programmed before IOSE 
(PCICMD register ) enabled. 
For example ICH7:
12.1.3  SATA : the base address register for the bus 
master register should be programmed before this bit is set.
11.1.3:  PCICMD (USB): The base address register for
USB should be programmed before this bit is set.
....
To make sure kernel code follow this rule 
, and prevent unnecessary confusion. I proposal this
patch. 
Note:
I'm sorry the patch is NOT in good format.
If you want to apply please use the attached patch file.
sorry for my email client.
