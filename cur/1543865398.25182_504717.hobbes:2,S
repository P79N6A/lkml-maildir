IMO it's called MODULE_LICENSE, not CFILE_LICENSE, therefore license 
strings in the module apply to the complete module.

Using an extra GPL .o is like MODULE_LICENSE("GPL")/* for nothing*/;,
you can't really do something about it.

IMO, using separate modules is the only thing you can do if you don't want 
to license your complete code using GPL.

reiserfs is available under a Proprietary license, too. Obviously this is OK.

In this case, the tag is not recognized and will be skipped as if it were
misspelled. I could also just bail out and deny loading the module.

ACK, and "BSD" etc. should be included. I kept the combinations for 
backward-compatibility. Possibly we could warn on using them.
