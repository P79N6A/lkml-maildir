While it is true that users generally shouldn't be unpacking tarballs as root,
It seems rather monumentally stupid for a trusted source for a critical
system component (aka, kernel.org) to be distributing tarballs like
this.
How hard is it really to make the git tarball export script set sane
owner (root) and permissions (644/755) on files and directories?
