Hallo,
i've got a problem with my 2Gbyte Sd-Card. It's an Ricoh R5C822 device included in my Samsung X20.
When I put in the card, dmesg shows up the following  error:
mmcblk0: mmc0:0002       1954816KiB
mmcblk0: unknown partition table
I've already formated the card to fat. And the same card with 1Gbyte works very well. BTW the manufactor is Extrememory. 
I've heard, there is a problem with USB card readers misformatting cards >= 2GB. How's the current status?
Bye 
Thomas
