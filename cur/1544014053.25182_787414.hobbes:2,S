I couldn't find one neither. (What does "re." mean?)
But optimistically speaking, there are many in-tree users who define "struct"
without "prev" pointer.
  # grep -hr 'struct [a-zA-Z0-9_]* \*next;' linux-2.6.28/include/linux/ | wc -l
  42
  # grep -hr 'struct [a-zA-Z0-9_]* \*prev;' linux-2.6.28/include/linux/ | wc -l

Not all structures listed below are used as singly linked list,
but many of them are used as singly linked list.
  struct sched_class;
  struct acpi_pci_driver;
  struct adb_request;
  struct atalk_route;
  struct core_thread;
  struct dma_async_tx_descriptor;
  struct erase_info;
  struct esp_pio_buffer;
  struct fdtable;
  struct floppy_raw_cmd;
  struct ftrace_ops;
  struct hdlc_proto;
  struct hwif_s;
  struct ippp_buf_queue;
  struct irqaction;
  struct isdn_net_local_s;
  struct kcore_list;
  struct mfc6_cache;
  struct mfc_cache;
  struct nls_table;
  struct notifier_block;
  struct page_list;
  struct pbe;
  struct phone_device;
  struct pnp_id;
  struct r3964_block_header;
  struct r3964_client_info;
  struct r3964_message;
  struct rcu_head;
  struct resource_list;
  struct sched_group;
  struct sdio_func_tuple;
  struct tasklet_struct;
  struct tty_buffer;
  struct xor_block_template;
Thus, I believe it is acceptable that TOMOYO uses singly linked list
unless Linus comes out and yell "No!".
Regards.
