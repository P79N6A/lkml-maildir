That can't be right.
Some operations, like "select()" and "pause()" always return EINTR, and 
indeed, real applications will break if you always restart. Restarting a 
pause() would be nonsensical.
This is why the kernel has ERESTARTSYS (restart always) and ERESTARTNOHAND
(restart if the signal had no handler) which will be turned into EINTR if
SA_RESTART isn't set. And even then, there are some ops that just always
use EINTR and don't even try to restart.

The specs are broken, and apparently don't take real life (or sanity -
pause() in particular just doesn't make sense if restarted) into account.  
Afaik, the historical BSD behaviour (which is what SA_RESTART is all
about) always was to just restart some system calls, not all of them.
