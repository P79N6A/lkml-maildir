We've been doing some measurements on how densely clumped ptes are.
On 32-bit platforms, they're pretty dense.  On IA64, quite a bit
sparser, depending on the workload of course.  I think that's mostly because
of the larger pagesize on IA64 -- with 64k pages, you don't need very
many to map a small object.
I'm hoping IanW can give more details.
