Subject: [patch] freeing spinlock when UP.

	Linus, Alan
	In both stable and development branches of the kernel, when 
reschedule_idle is called, it is presumed, that reschedule_idle will
release the spin_lock, thus call spin_unlock_irqrestore. This does not
happen when the kernels are compiled this __SMP__. Artur Skawina
<skawina@geocities.com> thinks this might delay servicing interrupts
unnecessarily. (thanks Artur for your response).
	Here's the patch against 2.2.14-pre17:

	Can you put this in?
