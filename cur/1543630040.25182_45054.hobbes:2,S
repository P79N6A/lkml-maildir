So what you are requesting is memmory which is suitable to be run
for IO. All you are talking about is io. I think ioalloc() and iofree()
fit it nice as names.

Thank you finally for explaining that the _consistant is about
well coherency and caches... This should have been put up in to the
documentation in question... becouse beleve me or not -
I know well about the "MESIs of the world", but I still wasn't
able to make any sense out of this _consistent term in first place.
And I still have the feeling that the nomenclature is bad.
What are you going to do if on some silly VLSI new slow CPU
invention at some time the need of doing pciIV_alloc_asynchronous() araises?
or pciXI_alloc_remote() or whatever? Are you going to request
all the driver writers to adjust to it again!?
(Something like this could for example just happen very urgently if Transmeta
decided to reveal native access to the hardware and tools in question I guess ;-).
