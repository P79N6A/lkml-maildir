As the author of Xgl and glitz I'd like to comment on a few things.

I've always designed Xgl to be a long term solution. I'd like if
whatever you or anyone else see as not long term with the design of Xgl
could be clarified.
We already had a new drawing API for X, the X Render extension. Xgl is
the first server to fully accelerate X Render.

I'm not certain of that.

That's just because we haven't had the need to expose it yet. I don't
see why this can't be exposed through the Render extension. The trickier
part is to figure out how we should expose it through the cairo API but
that's not an X server design problem.
