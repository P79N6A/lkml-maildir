Subject: [PATCH] Slightly safer Magic SysRq
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

About 10 months ago, I hit Alt-PrintScrn-l two times too many, due to
poor memory, and I decided that my kernel would probably be better
without this (considering that according to the documentation, it's
guarenteed to kill the system), and so I patched my code.
Up until now, I've procrastinated on submitting this trivial patch due
to wanting to make absolutely sure it works; it's been tried on four x86
machines so far, but they don't make heavy use of Magic SysRq.  No
problems found so far.  Basically, my patch turns it into a synonym for
Alt-PrintScrn-i, although I've been tempted to disable it entirely, so
that noone would get in the habit of using the other option.  (If people
provide me feedback, I may do the other method.)  I've not patched it to
change documentation other than Configure.help, due to it being an
option.
Kernel 2.3.21 is the first I've tried that needs a different patch,
although I've not kept up, so I'm sure there are a bunch in the 2.3.x
series (2.2.13-pre14 worked fine), so I've made a second patch.
Due to Pine's "helpful" use of base64 for text attachments, I'm also
including both patches in the text portion, but the attachments should
work fine for people who can handle it.
