Hi all,
   Thanks for Greg's howto and others' documents (Such as the "kernel
hacker's guide to git). But I still have some detail questions:
   Which is everyone working on: the "latest linus git tree" or the
"-mm kernel"? As I tried, the -mm kernel is only a patch, which MAY
can not be applied to latest kernel. For example, current
2.6.15-rc5-mm3 patch can't be applied to  current kernel without
rejections and conflicts.
   As Greg pointed out, most patches should be tested on -mm kernel.
So I assum that a developer just get an exact 2.6.15-rc5 kernel from
git, apply the 2.6.15-rc5-mm3 patch, do some work and send out the
patch, then just stay there for next -mm patch?
   Thanks in advace!
BTW:  git question, Is there any way to get my .git/refs/ folder
updated through http? I mean not through rsync?
Regards,
Luke Yang
