You _really_ don't want to use ext3 on CF unless you want to wear the
flash quickly.  Just because a filesystem has journaling does _not_
mean that its suitable for flash (in fact, it may be far worse for
flash than its non-journaled counterpart, as in this case.)

This is an IDE driver bug - it performs PIO but does not ensure that the
individual pages are properly flushed to RAM before telling the kernel
that the IO is complete.  (If someone wants to disagree, look at how
rd.c does flush_dcache_page, and see previous discussions on lkml
concerning this.)
