Uh, last I checked on my linux based embedded device I didn't want to swap to 
flash.  Hmm.., now why was that..., oh, that's right, it's *much* more 
expensive than memory, oh yes, and it actually gets FRIED when you write to a 
block more than 100k times.  Oh, what was that other thing..., oh yes, and 
its SOLDERED ON THE BOARD.  Damn..., guess I just lost a grand or so.
Seriously folks, Linux isn't just for big webservers...
Thanks,
Shane Nay.
(Oh, BTW, I really appreciate the work that people have done on the VM, but 
folks that are just talking..., well, think clearly before you impact other 
people that are writing code.)
