I am trying my best today to get a 4 way system up and running for this test.  
IMO, per cpu is best..  with just one socket, I seriously could not get over 
33% cpu utilization on a 4 way (back in April).  With TCP, I could max it 
out.  I'll update later today hopefully with some promising results.
