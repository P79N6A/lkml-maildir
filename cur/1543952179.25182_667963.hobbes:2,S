Hi,
On an Intel Pentium 200 machine:
~ $ dmesg | grep F0

~ $ cat /prc/cpuinfo

On 2.4 kernels it showed it correctly.
I also attach my .config
  $ ./ver_linux
If some fields are empty or look unusual you may have an old version.
Compare to the current minimal requirements in Documentation/Changes.
