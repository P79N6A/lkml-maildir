Johannes is using a feature of kernel-doc that I wasn't even familiar
with, also one that no one else is using.  I'm sure that Johannes can
point us to some source code and generated output for it though.
If you want to see a little of it in source code form, 2 net drivers
use it, but then they aren't processed by kernel-doc for generated
output.  They are drivers/net/3c501.c & 3c527.c.  Look for the
"DOC:" comment blocks.
