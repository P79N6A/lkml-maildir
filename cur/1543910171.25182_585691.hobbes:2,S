Sure, it wasn't me who made the comparison though.

Which has to be investigated.  A few kB is a lot more than expected.

My point is that people *already* made those assumptions.  There
are two ways to clean up this mess:
1) Have the "volatile" semantics by default, change the users
    that don't need it;
2) Have "non-volatile" semantics by default, change the users
    that do need it.
Option 2) randomly breaks stuff all over the place, option 1)
doesn't.  Yeah 1) could cause some extremely minor speed or
code size regression, but only temporarily until everything has
been audited.

Sure.  We aren't _adding_ anything here though, not on the platforms
where it is most likely to show up, anyway.

I'm not dismissing that.  x86 however is one of the few architectures
where mistakenly leaving out a "volatile" will not easily show up on
user testing, since the compiler will very often produce a memory
reference anyway because it has no registers to play with.

That's a good point.  Maybe we should create _two_ new APIs, one
explicitly going each way.

I didn't conduct any formal poll either :-)

Not really I think, no.  But not the other way around, either.
Most uses of it seem to expect it though.

Me?  Not much.
