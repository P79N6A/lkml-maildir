Hi,
After doing BK pull last night INIT gets stuck in do_tty_hangup after
executing rc.sysinit. Was booting fine with pull from 2 days ago...
Anyone else seeing this?
I suspect pidhash patch because it touched tty_io.c, but I have not tried
reverting it as it is getting too late here... So I apologize in advance
if I am pointing finger at the innocent ;)
