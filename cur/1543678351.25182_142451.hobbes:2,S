HEllo,
Today I tried kernel 2.5.72. And it compiled without any problems. (on a 
i686 - PIV)
But when I'm trying to boot from that kernel, it stops just after the line
         'uncompressing .................. ok now booting'
I tried to compile the kernel as a i386, pentium classic , and a pentium 
pro, but it always gives the same results.
Anybody has an idea what I did wrong?
rgrds,
       Bart
