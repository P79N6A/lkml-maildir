Subject: how to bypass buffer cache for a block device driver

I've a custom hardware with lot of inbuilt cache.
I want to write a block device driver for it and i 
*want to bypass the buffer cache*.
I intend to run filesystems on top of it.
I filled in the "read" and "write" functions with my own versions
 and bypassed "block_read" and "block_write".
I could "fdisk" but mount failed complaining about "request_fn".
I filled in the "request_fn" and now, it appears to me 
that all io happens through "request_fn". For instance, 
"printk" lines in "read" and "write" print
nothing.
If i check the pid in "request_fn"  it is that 
of "kflushd" or "bdflush".

Is it possible to bypass the buffer cache completely 
for a block device driver? What should I do?
Is it possible to bypass only for some processes and 
let thro for others? (This is the final behaviour I want.)
Where should I look for more about block device 
drivers and their interaction with buffer cache (i.e. apart from 
code in terms of design, structure etc.,).

I am not on the mailing list, so please post a copy to
