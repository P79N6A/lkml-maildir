Hi. The definitive site for nbd is Pavel Machek's site:
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/nbd/nbd.html.
 It has a userland
client and server. In addition, if you'd like to try my kernel server
module, there's a pointer to that as well. It's been built and tested
under 2.2, although I'm not certain about 2.2.14. If you have any problems
with it, please let me know. Thanks.

Subject: Network Block Device 
Hello,
I am trying to find the Network Block Device deamon
for the server and client side. I found:
http://sites.netscape.net/sebtomac/nbd/nbdd.html
But the source does doesn't compile on my RH 2.2.14-5.0
and the patch does not apply.
Could you please point me into the right direction? Where
can I get it from? Any patches to the kernel? Any special
kernel configuration (aside enabling NBD as a module)?
Thank you.
