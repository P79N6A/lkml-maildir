That is really not a great solution although it's half OK.
Here's why?
You can put labels on all your ext2 partitons but what happens on:
    cdroms
    zip drives
and probably most important:
    swap
but lets just say anything other than ext2 partition.
Also you can't put a LABEL in LILO either.
This is probably great for those people who use ide only, but then again
people who had ide only machines were not affected by v2.4.3!
Good try though!!!
