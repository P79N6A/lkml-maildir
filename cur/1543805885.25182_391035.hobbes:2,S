It'd be nice to think that licensing fees wouldn't make a difference
as people would understand that locking themselves into something
they're not allowed to exert any control over is not a good idea...  &
so oem's would have to chose due to revenue loss rather than simply
'licensing savings'.
Unfortunately I doubt we're anywhere near close enough yet, so I'll
get my head out of cloud nine...
