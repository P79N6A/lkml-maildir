Hmm, thinking about it that sounds unlikely because only the first and the last
user should touch the rwsem head. But ok it might be possible.
BTW maybe it would be a good idea to switch the wait list to a hlist,
then the last user in the queue wouldn't need to 
touch the cache line of the head. Or maybe even a single linked
list then some more cache bounces might be avoidable.
That is really why we need a single C implementation. If we had that 
such optimizations would be pretty easy. Without it it's a big mess.

Would you be willing to run numbers comparing them? (or provide a benchmark?)
