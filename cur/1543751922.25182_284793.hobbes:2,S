Subject: Eth0 : Configuration switch across different kernels

Hello linux-experts,
  I have installed two kernels in my Linux system.
They are kernel 2.4.28 and 2.6.9. Now whenever I am
switching between these kernels, the network card is
removed and it prompts whether it should reconfigure
it or keep the existing configuration as such or do
nothing. What is the reason for this? Can anyone help
me regarding this?
Thanks,
selva
