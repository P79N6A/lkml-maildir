Subject: [PATCH 0/6] kobject/hotplug split
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This splits the implicit generation of hotplug events from
kobject_add() and kobject_del(), to give the driver core
control over the time the event is created.
The kobject_register() and unregister functions still have the same
behavior and emit the events by themselves.
The class, block and device core is changed now to emit the hotplug
event _after_ the "dev" file, the "device" symlink and the default
attributes are created. This will save udev from spinning in a stat() loop
to wait for the files to appear, which is expensive if we have a lot of
concurrent events.
