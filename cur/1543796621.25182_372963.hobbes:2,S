Or, in case there is some unknown objection to the mentioned code: use
the 802.11 stack that comes along with MadWifi, which provides things
like virtual interfaces (for multiple SSID support on one physical card)
and WPA support.
Although I'm a bit biased towards MadWifi, I'd second your suggestion to
make use of the Devicescape code. The benefit of having a fully-blown
802.11 stack in the kernel that drivers can make use of has been
discussed before, so I won't go into that yet again.
Bye, Mike
