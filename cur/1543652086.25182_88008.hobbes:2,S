  Rebuilt my home machine last night.  Used my 2.4.18 .config file as
passing it down the chain as always.  Made the kernel with the standard
alias and rebooted.  BRIGHT GREEN screen.  Rebooted to an older 2.4.18
kernel, changed a few options, no go.  On a guess I removed the
FrameBuffer option from the console menu and tried again.  Box is up and
working great.  In addition, when the FB was compiled into the kernel or
as a module X wouldn't work, said it couldn't find the NVidia kernel
module.  Excluding the kernel frame buffer worked great.
