Shoot, that would be great ;-)
For the future, libata will need a tad bit more queueing than is
currently supported.  But there is enough support in libata right now to
handle basic Promise support.
On a legal note, I would prefer that completely new drivers (i.e. no
copied code from other sources) be licensing in the same way as
libata.c.  Maintainer's preference in the end, of course, but I would
like to strongly encourage following libata.c's example ;-)
I have a TX2 board, too, so I can test your stuff as well.
