tshark -i eth0, eth1, lo are all empty. Works under 2.6.23.0 just
fine. A quick scan of the log between 2.6.24-rc3 and current tip
(-rc5) doesn't show any obvious fixes, but then again, what do I know.
I'll check current tip on the weekend when I'll have the luxury to
have my main system down long enough for a test. Right now I'm kinda
up against a deadline, but didn't want to leave it unreported. Should
be easy for someone else to confirm or deny whether current tip has
the problem.
