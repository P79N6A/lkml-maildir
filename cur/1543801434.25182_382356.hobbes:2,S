Funnily enough, people who added SIGIO and epoll did not remove
select nor limited its capabilities.
The ALSA api has issues, whether you want to acknowledge them or not.
The OSS api has issues too, of course.  But it is there to stay, and
it has advantages in some situations, like when simplicity or not
depending on a shared library matters.  Ignoring it is stupid.  Doing
your best to cripple it is stupid.  The OSS api is an entrypoint in
the sound system as valid and important than others.
  OG.
