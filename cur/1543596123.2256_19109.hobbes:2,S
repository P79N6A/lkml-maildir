Their power only extends to the borders of this state.  They have little 
ability to interfere wth someone in Swansea, Great Britian, or even 
Silicon Valley, California.   The problem I have is they can get the 
local courts here to do whatever they ask.  Not so other places.  I think
it's pretty safe so long as I am not the one releasing it.
