Hi,
I bought a used sound card for secondary uses, it happens to be
a Diamond Sound Monster MX300 with an Aureal Vortex2 chip.
Unfortunately, after putting it into the machine, it doesn't boot up,
I get an oops that prevents booting further. I have hand-copied
the relevant info:
RIP: {:snd_au8830:snd_vortex_probe+411}
...
Call Trace: {sprintf+81} {__wake_up+56}
 {pci_device_probe+256} {driver_probe_device+82}
 {__driver_attach+142} {__driver_attach+0}
 {bus_for_each_dev+67} {bus_add_driver+118}
 {__pci_register_driver+142} {stop_machine_run+58}
 {sys_init_module+278} {system_call+126}
The kernel is not tainted.
$ uname -a
Linux xxxxxx 2.6.16-1.2111_FC5 #1 SMP Thu May 4 21:16:04 EDT 2006 x86_64 
x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
System is an FC5/x86-64 updated to the latest erratas.
There is only one sprintf() call in the whole au88x0 driver source,
line 328 in au88x0.c. Why it fails for x86-64 is beyond my understanding.
This is the code in question:
327:    strcpy(card->shortname, CARD_NAME_SHORT);
328:    sprintf(card->longname, "%s at 0x%lx irq %i",
                card->shortname, chip->io, chip->irq);
Pointer "card" exists or the driver would have failed earlier allocating 
or dereferencing it.
card->longname is 80 byte large, length of the string is at most 44 byte:
12 byte (format string fillings + terminating NULL) +
6 byte (CARD_NAME_SHORT) +
6 byte (unsigned long written in hex) +
10 byte (unsigned int written in dec)
I couldn't seek further, I put the card away for now. :-)
Best regards,
Zoltán Böszörményi
