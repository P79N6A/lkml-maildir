This output comes from the send_packet function. If currently there are no 
resources to send a packet, it is re-queued and send later. It would be 
better to remove this output, since it does not mean much and only 
confuses people (I learned to better avoid such "informational" output 
since the time I wrote this driver...).

Christoph
