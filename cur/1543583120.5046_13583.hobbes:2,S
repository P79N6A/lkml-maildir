Subject: Re: [PATCH][CFT] per-process namespaces for Linux
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/2/26/65

	New version uploaded on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/namespaces-a-S2.gz
Changes:
	* nosuid, nodev and noexec are per-mountpoint now.
	* new flag for mount() - MS_MOVE (move a subtree, probable syntax
for mount(8) - mount --move old new; old must be a mountpoint)
	* Fixes for "lazy" umount.
	* CLONE_NEWNS is made root-only (CAP_SYS_ADMIN, actually)
Folks, please help with testing. Again, It Works Here(tm).
							Cheers,
								Al
