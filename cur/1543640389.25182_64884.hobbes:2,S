Well then you have no device nodes without devfs. D'uh? :)

No, the devfs documentation says that it is "safe" to have devfs
compiled in and not use it -- you will just use the standard /dev. It
does not imply in any way that you will be using devfs if you don't
mount it, it says that if you choose _not_ to use devfs, then it will be
able to fall cleanly back to standard /dev. In other words,
CONFIG_DEVFS_FS provides the _ability_ to use devfs, not a
_requirement_. 
That's all it says.
To assume that it means anything else would be incredibly silly.
