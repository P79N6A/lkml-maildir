I have the same problem here, but just when I try to use md to setup a
disk array. In fact, I can dd to /dev/null two disks at the same time
(each on its separate controller) without any troubles (each disk
through output is 40 MB/s). Software raid with hptraid works fine but
I don't get significant performance improvement. But each time I try
to use md, I always get the same problem than you. mkraid, raidstop or
anything which access /dev/md0 triggers a DMA problem.
I have asked the question in linux-raid mailing list yesterday but got
no solution so far.
I have upgraded to newest BIOS patched with the latest BIOS from
Highpoint (2.31) and there is no change (but I think the BIOS is not
used). I have tried with a vanilla 2.4.18 and with 2.4.19-pre3-ac1.
