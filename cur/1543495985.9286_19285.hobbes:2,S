Yes.
use /proc/pci or /proc/bus/pci/devices
Eg. I have the devices:
  Bus  0, device  10, function  0:
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 9.  
      I/O at 0x6400 [0x6401].
  Bus  0, device  11, function  0:
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 12.  
      I/O at 0x6500 [0x6501].
ifconfig tells me:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:C0:FF:EE:00
          Interrupt:9 Base address:0x6400 
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:C1:49:00:DE:AD  
          Interrupt:12 Base address:0x6500 
which tells me device 10 is eth0 and device 11 is eth1 (compare I/O
addresses and IRQs)
Simple enough to write a small perl (or bash) script that does the
comparison.
