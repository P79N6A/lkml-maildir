Hi!
Just for the record... this goes out to the lkml. This discussion was
internal for way too long. (for interested lkml readers, I'm sure
linux-pm mailing list has public archive somewhere).

Yes, please continue. I do not think we can just rip cpufreq interface
out of kernel, and I do not think it is as broken as you claim it
is. Ripping interface out of kernel takes years.
I'm sure cpufreq_frequency_table could be moved to asm/ header if you
felt strongly about that.
I believe we need to fix cpufreq if it is broken for embedded
cases.
