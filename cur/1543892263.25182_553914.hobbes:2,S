Ah, yes indeed. We were discussing wether it would be better to update
page->index (as this patch does) or not change vma->vm_pgoff. Bill
argued that the latter would be safe, it would just limit the merge
capabilities of the anon vma (and the stack rarely, if ever, merges
anyway).
I myself an not quite sure on the effects of ->vm_pgoff of anon vmas
yet.
