Amiga handles it too.

No it doesn't. Put your root-fs on hda6 ( not unusual in dual boot
setups ),
delete hda5, watch your linux fail to boot.
( the kernel will be loaded , but it won't find the root-fs , because it
looks
in hda6 , but the partition has "migrated" to hda5 )

This won't fix the "kernel doesn't find root-fs" problem.

Kludges are bad, unfortunately that is all we have currently :-(

For the "load the kernel" part.
