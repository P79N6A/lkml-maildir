[snipped the /proc/asound details]
And it was; thanks to Gunther Sohler who tipped me the right way I
  installed the software I was missing (alsa-lib, alsa-driver and
  alsa-tools plus the xmms-alsa plugin), unmuted the audio channels
  by means of alsamixer (*the* problem - somehow the channels are
  muted by default), set volume for what I use and now xine/xmms
  play audio fine.
As a bonus I cleared my mind about a few differences between ALSA
  and OSS :)
Sorry for the waste of bandwidth and thanks again,
