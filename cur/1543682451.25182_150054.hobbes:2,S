As many people seems to have problems with using devfs under 2.6, here is the 
patch I'm using and that goes in current mandrake. It autodetects kernel 
version and is using either /etc/modules.devfs or /etc/modprobe.devfs on 2/4 
and 2/6 resp.
patch is trivial enough and eliminates need for modprobe hack in 
module-init-tools that never worked reliably.
you still have to provide valid modprobe.devfs of course. One in 
module-init-tools has problems but would do as starting point depending on 
which modules you are actually using.
