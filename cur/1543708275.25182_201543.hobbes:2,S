Hello,
I recently upgraded my kernel to 2.4.25 on Dell 530 dual Xeons/2gb RAM. I had
the following error twice. 
hdb: dma-timer-expiry: dma status=0x61
hdb: error waiting for DMA
Then the system gets hung. It happens in the morning when I hit the enter key
at the command prompt to refresh my system. Did I set the wrong DMA in the
kernel configuration? I enabled the followings:
Generic PCI bus-master DMA support
Use PCI DMA by default when available
Could someone help me?
Thanks,
Jin
