Buffalo (buffalotech.com) have also a bunch of products, MIPS based
wireless routers and bridges, running Linux. I could not find the driver
of the wireless cards -based on Broadcom 4306 chips- in the kernel bundle
they distribute in their website:

)
http://www.buffalotech.com/wireless/support/faq/GPL_linux_source.zip
Maybe I oversaw them.
Nor they provide drivers for the wireless cardbus. I wrote them 
about it but received no answer.
