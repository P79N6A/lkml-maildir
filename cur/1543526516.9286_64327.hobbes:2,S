It is fine to be impatient. I have been impatient for about 6 months about
a fix for the alpha __delay()/__udelay() stuff that can be 200% wrong due
to inlining and that notably breaks the SCSI clock speed measurement by
ncr/sym53c8xx at initialisation. This stuff does not seem to have been
fixed in all still alive linux branches (I mean 2.0/2.2/2.3). 
David S. Miller and I are currently working on the driver changes for the
new scsi/pci/dma interface in 2.3. I am impatient to have statisfying
driver changes that I will want to be made available, even if I donnot
personally use alpha machines.
By the way, Pamela Delaney (from LSILOGIC) and I (from home:)) would be
glad to hear DEC/COMPAQ ingenieers about the status of the
__delay()/__udelay() stuff for alpha in Linuxes. For now, Pamela has to
send a band-aiding patch to linux-alpha user each time she recieves a
report for the known ncr/sym53c8xx driver problem caused by the 200% error
range of udelay() on alpha. And it is time waste each time since months. 
Thanks in advance. 
Gérard.
