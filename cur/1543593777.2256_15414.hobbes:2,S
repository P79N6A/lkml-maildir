I wrote something similar to this for userspace (via ld preload). Most of
my checks followed strings around and made sure they were length checked
so as to avoid stack overflows, but I also checked args to open, etc..
In your case, basically all destinations are trusting sinks at some level:
userspace gives you data to put it somewhere. You might want to instead
check that data is passing through functions that 'detaint', by checking
capabilities, etc. I bet that you'll find that something like 90% of code
paths are covered by a few common security checks. And that most of the
remainder could be rewritten to be.
