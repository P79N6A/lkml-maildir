I do not see it strange. At the time of creation, user sees the failure
(that there isn't enough resource to provide the required/requested
guarantee) and can act accordingly.
BTW, VMware does it this way.

we can have guarantee and still handle it this way.

complexity is high in doing that.

should be able to get other controllers also under this framework.

Please see the emails i sent earlier in this context:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ckrm-tech&m=115593001810616&w=2
We would need at least:
 - BC should be created/deleted explicitly by the user
 - cleaner interface for controller writers
