Partially - yes. For 1% cases or so.

It does. In 99% cases. If you system constantly overflows mem+swap in
normal situations then you need to add more swap. And unusual situations
is when PHP script (or Netscape or whatever) suddenly goes nuts and eats
tons of memory in a second. In such case it's better to kill this PHP script
(or Netscape) then anything else.
P.S. Yes, better to debvelop system with unswappable userspace AI or something.
Do it is you really need to cover remaining 1% -- you have sources ... Better
to do right thing in 99% cases (with OOM patch) then to do wrong thing in 99%
cases. Without this patch usually first killed thing is syslogd, then klogd
and slightly after that -- sshd (when you are trying to log on and fix problem).
After that point system is unusable...
