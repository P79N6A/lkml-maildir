For LRTBF you'll find the pinout in the README of the package.

Things is you're going to need one logger per target. As for a
small website, that sounds good enough. Don't know how feasible
it would be but it may be desirable to also have a background
task that automatically checks for new releases and conducts
the tests automatically.

There are no user-space changes needed, but you may need to
install a few things that aren't there (LMbench, LTP, hackbench,
etc.)

It's your choice really, but if the tests are to be automated,
then local compile shouldn't be a problem since you won't be
waiting on it personally.

For me at least.
