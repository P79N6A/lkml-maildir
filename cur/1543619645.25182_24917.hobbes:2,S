There actually used to be a timer function in i810_rng driver which
directly added entropy to the pool.  batch_entropy_store was exported in
order to do this.
However, that was just the quick and dirty way.  You DO NOT want to do
this in the kernel, because one must perform fitness tests on the random
data before adding it to the kernel's /dev/[u]random entropy pool.
Putting proper fitness tests into the kernel is just plain code bloat.
Therefore, RNG drivers -must- deal with a userspace agent in order to be
properly used, and properly secure.
The userspace tools for i810 RNG specifically are available at the
website URL mentioned in the source code.  So if somebody cannot find
them, feel free to laugh.
