Actually, it seems vaguely possible this could be implemented as a
layer on top of any normal file system - just use files to store
continuation inodes and the like.  Then you could use the file system
that best suits your workload underneath. (Suparna has a paper in the
next OLS talking about something related but not identical, check it
out.) Most likely it would be criminally wasteful of space and really
slow, but it's something to think about.

*laugh* What about ext2.5? :) Seriously, ext2 needs to be left alone,
but I'm open to the possibility that any of the existing file system
code bases could be forked off into a development file system.  Some
ideas would be more compatible with some code bases than others, and
forking might get rid of some constraints - e.g., an XFS fork could
get rid of a lot of crufty compat code.
