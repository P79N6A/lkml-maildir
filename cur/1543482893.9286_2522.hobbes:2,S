Ok, sounds reasonable.

Here's the first vote in favour.

Like devfs, reiserfs, lfa, ISDN, etc.?! Oh, and I hope NFS v3 will make it
into v2.3... This kind of means that we leave all the size-expansion
issues until v2.5?! That's ok for me, because I don't have a large machine
with >1TB HD and >65536 users, but not everyone might be as happy... :)
Oh, I'd really like pcmcia support to become a part of the main kernel
too. But maybe that's not our decision, but one for the pcmcia-team to
make?!
