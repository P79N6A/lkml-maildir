This is not safe from wraparound.  Let one thread hold the
lock forever; let other threads keep trying to take the lock
while periodically getting SIGALRM.  Eventually one of the
spinning threads will incorrectly acquire the mutex.
On sparc32, atomic_t is only 24 bits wide, so it wouldn't
take very long at all to wrap.  It's slightly longer for 
the other platforms, but it can still happen.  And note
that even 64-bit platforms may be using a 32-bit atomic_t.
You really do need that cmpxchg loop.
