Slight correction: DOS, Windows and NT all use both \ and /, *and* have  
reserved :.

I think you completely missed the point.
Say you have a MacOS HFS pathname ":dir1:dir2:stats from 1/1/2000". Then  
under Linux HFS, this would usually be translated to look like
"dir1/dir2/stats from 1:1:2000", that is, they'd do a tr :/ /: on it.
Actually, it seems slightly more complicated than that, but that was the  
point Alan made - and doing this would clash with the :-for-streams usage.
