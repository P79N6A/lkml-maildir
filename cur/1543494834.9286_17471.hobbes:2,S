thank you very much! That was EXACTLY what I needed!

I have updated the graphs at 
http://www.foobar.de/memgraphs/
 (this time, the
test was done with 32M of physical memory, to speed things up). 
The plot "memleak.gif" has been created from the information collected from
your memleak-Device. It clearly shows that the network driver for the RTL8139
is the offender (dev.c seems to be accounted for the nic driver's memory,
too).
Of course, now I've got to think about ways to fix this problem...
Thanks to all of you for your help.
