There were some other opinions voiced including one from the person who
started this discussion.
So no, the people who write the tools that parse sysfs (like HAL.) don't
appreciate this.
People who write tools that parse sysfs like shell scripts don't
appreciate it either, as I illustrated.
You've yet to give any technical reason why we can't have meaningful
busids rather than random numbers. Your entire argument seems to be that
its wrong because its a bit different and nobody else does it...
