Subject: [BUG] 2.4.0-test9-pre9: i810_rng only compiles as module, also ..

starting with the new test9-pre9, the i810_rng driver will not compile as
part of the kernel -- only a module (see below).
also, and more importantly, i can not get the driver working on my
i815-based (ASUS CUSL2) mainboard.  the i815's 802 FWH should not be
different than the 810/820.  i really want to try to hack this out, since
i have the board ... in the mean time, anyone have any ideas about the
i815 and the i810_rng driver?
results of 'make bzImage' with CONFIG_INTEL_RNG as a module:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 
-fomit-frame-pointer -pipe   -march=i686 -fno-strict-aliasing -c -o 
i810_rng.o i810_rng.c
