Er, I rest my case?  Anyway, the history around X11 is completely
different from the present situation, and there were good arguments at
the time for structuring the problem so that the X server was
relatively kernel-neutral even if it was banging directly on a
framebuffer, and later on 2-D acceleration hardware.  As graphics
chips have become more sophisticated, pure-userspace X11 has become
less tenable.

It does not get less crazy and stupid because we open a big hole from
kernelspace to userspace and let them pretend that they have a GPL
"driver" when all of the chip init logic is peeked and poked from the
same closed code in userspace.  Most low-level drivers (the kind that
involve IRQs and registers local to the CPU; USB is different) cannot
be done right from userspace and we shouldn't encourage people to try.

Their problems need not become our problems.

People who want to keep their logic in non-GPL code do so by providing
binary-only drivers.  That's a sane compromise in certain sectors, and
occasionally results in the eventual opening of the driver (when the
illusion of competitive advantage in closed-ness wears off) in
integrable shape.  A customer with some leverage and technical skill
can negotiate for access to the source code so that he can fix the
bugs that are biting him, rebuild with a toolchain that isn't from the
Dark Ages, and so forth: a real-life demonstration to the vendor that
letting outsiders work on the code will sell more chips.  But if you
actively encourage a brain-damaged userspace driver strategy, that
opportunity is lost.

What instance is that?  Are you sure it wasn't a case of things being
done in the driver that should have been done in a library all along?

Today's problem is that too many chip suppliers' in-house software
people have neither the skills nor the schedule room nor the influence
to insist that drivers be written competently and maintainably,
whether or not they are maintained in the public view.  So chipmakers
turn to the BSP vendors, whose business model is built around being
the only people who can do incremental development on the code they
write.
I'm not at all hostile to BSP vendors or to chipmakers who wind up in
this position; that's the way most of the industry works nowadays.
But I do want to know when I'm dealing with that situation, because
the appropriate strategies for getting a product to market are
different when it costs the chip vendor real cash money each time they
commission a recompile to meet some customer's expectations.
Pretending that driver code doesn't need reviewing every few months as
the kernel's locking strategies, timer handling, internal APIs, etc.
evolve makes things worse.
Just like the only thing worse that a salesperson who's on commission
is a salesperson who isn't on commission, the only thing worse than a
closed device driver in kernelspace is a closed device driver in
userspace.
