Hallo,
I did not get it work with my Maxtor SATA 80GB 6Y080M0.
With 2.6.5-rc2/3 or mm1 no chance to get the higher request size. Is
this not possible with the the smaller drives and libata? Im not
sure if this disk has the the lba48 feature?
Abit NF7-S with an SilImage 3112a is here under Fedora
running.
please cc me,
Marcus
