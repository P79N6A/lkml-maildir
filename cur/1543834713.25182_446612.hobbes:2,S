This is for the actual async network I/O.  I certainly can agree with
this.  The other parts are not exclusively or even mainly interesting
for networking and likely should be discussed elsewhere.  And the net
aio stuff depends on the other two parts.  netdev would certainly be my
last choice but if this is what people want, so be it.
