I want to do some traffic shaping under Linux 2.2.
There seem to be 2 ways of doing this: Shaper and CBQ.
Which of these is the most robust?
CBQ is marked NEW and SHAPER experimental.
What documentation exists on how to use CBQ?
Shaper has shaper.txt in Documentation/network
Can I use each of these to shape a subset of IP addresses.
For example an IP alias.
Suggested usage eth0 210.9.66.1 netmask 255.255.255.0.
Alias eth0:0 210.9.66.193 netmask 255.255.255.192
Can I then traffic shape eth0:0
