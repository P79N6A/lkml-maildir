It does work - sort of; BIOS parsing code is correct. It lacks the
proper connector detection though (esp. port sharing). ATOM BIOS has a
different data layout, so this should be added (now radeonfb thinks that
I've 2 monitors).
I'll be away this weekend, so I'll try to come up with a patch as soon
as I return home.
