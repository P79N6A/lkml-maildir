IMHO, the correct way to distinguish between the two would be to use the
wbc->nr_to_write field. If all the instances of writepage() were to set
that field to '1', then the filesystems could do the right thing.
As it is, you have shrink_list() that sets it to the value
"SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX" for no apparent reason...
