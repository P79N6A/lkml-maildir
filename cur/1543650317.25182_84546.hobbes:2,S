Andrew,
It would be very helpful if you could point out what were the bugs you found
objectionable enough to withold your approval for the patch's inclusion.
It appears that the lack of comments in the code is one major concern. That alone
being a reason to dismiss the sys_epoll patch seems unreasonable. Consider
- there are another 3-4 months before the stable kernel will be out. In the
interim, Davide with assistance from some of us IBMers can put in the desired
level of comments in the code. Our committment to having a fully understood patch
should be evident from the release of man pages and a detailed web page listing
performance results alongwith the patch itself.
- this patch is the ONLY available scalable alternative to poll() and does far
better. To make an example out of this patch for not conforming to commenting
standards is a little extreme.
That being said, if there are bugs (small or large) that make the patch
questionable, I would understand why it can't be included. But we do need to
know what the bugs are. Davide had been very responsive to your last set of
comments and included all of them in his patch.
Please do find the time to list out atleast some of the bugs that you found.
Thanks,
