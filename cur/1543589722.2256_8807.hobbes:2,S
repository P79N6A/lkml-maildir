Ouch! 
How is that supposed to work with the dcache?
1. Does POSIX state, that "/" is the directory/entry[1] separator?
2. Can a device node be an directory?
If 1. and not 2., there is no way to implement it like that.
I don't know how people call this, if they call sth. like DevFS
"crappy", but I would be very surprised, if they call it "clean".
Just think of: 
test -r /dev/ttyF00/speed=9600,clocal && cat /dev/ttyF00/speed=9600,clocal
Or the equivalent in C in most of the programs, which read sth.
POSIX might not forbid this, because common sense already does ;-)
