The 2.<odd> series, like 2.5 is a strictly development kernel series; new
features go into these all the time.  You can expect it to:
1. not build.
2. crash.
3. silently eat your filesystems.
4. break userspace programs.
or any combination of the above.  If you're looking for stability, stick
with the 2.<even> series.
