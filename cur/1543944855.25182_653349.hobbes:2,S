I find that difficult to agree.  As long as static ones are put above
all local ones, they are visually distinctive enough.  static variables
used by a single function are usually declared in the function all
through the source tree.

Well, I thought it was an obvious clean up.  Time to split this patch
up, I guess.
Thanks.
