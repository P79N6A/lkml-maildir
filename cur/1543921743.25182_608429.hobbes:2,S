I don't want to argue for or against the actual revert; however if Linus/James/Chris
decide to do a revert, I've made a patch to do that below
(doing a full git revert is tricky since it gets mixed up with various other cleanup 
patches; even inside the original patch. I've done the relevant pieces by hand via a 
selective patch -R and compile-tested it). In addition I've made the modularity a 
Kconfig option, since it's clearly something that is contested and thus is justified 
as a user compile time choice; people who don't want this (out of paranoia or otherwise)
can now decide to disable, while others who want to experiment or use out of tree 
LSM modules, can select the KConfig option.
If it turns out that the above module becomes unmaintained and no longer usable, and no
other useful cases show up, we can always garbage collect this code in the future; it's 
now low-overhead anyway for those who care, due to the KConfig option.

Subject: revert the modular LSM patch
Since there is a real out of tree, non-racey modular LSM module,
add back the capability to have modular LSM modules as a config option.
(note that this patch fails checkpatch.pl in a few places, however
since this is just a reverse-patch of the original code, I don't
want to fix this in order to keep exact revert behavior)
