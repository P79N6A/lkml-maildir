In the past yes now there is no reason not to default it to active tuning.

PS bone-heads or not, you have to follow the rules of data-phase services;
	regardless, because the nature of the interface layer in the
	hardware appears broken.  You are dealing with a child that has
	to be hand walked the instructions, forever.  Failing to do so is
	the same as telling you kid to play in the interstate.
