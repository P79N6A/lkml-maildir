In a lot of cases, UP is just a simplified, degenerate case of SMP (which
is itself often a degenerate case of NUMA).  Wouldn't it make a lot of
sense to have a single scheduler which 1) was relively simple, 2) was as
good as the current scheduler (or better) on UP, and 3) scaled well on SMP (and
NUMA)?  I think the current lse scheduler meets all of those goals pretty
well.
Config options means the user has to choose, I have too many important
choices to make already when building a kernel.
Others have proposed loadable scheduler modules, but the overhead doesn't
seem to justify the separation.  Config options mean more testing, more
stable APIs for low level scheduling (or more times when one or the other
is broken).
