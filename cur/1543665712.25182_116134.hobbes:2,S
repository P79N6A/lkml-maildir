	I don't know what you mean by "force."  devfs_register does
not know (or "care") if there is a physical device associated with the
major/minor/ops that it is given.

	User level programs can also do mknod() calls in devfs
directories, if that is what you are referring to, so you could
do "mknod /dev/tts/3 c 4 68", for example.
	By the way, I notice that 2.5.64 with devfs already creates
/dev/tts/0 through /dev/tts/49.
