You are right (although some gtk-apps have the same problem), but that 
may be caused by the fact that I dont _see_ other apps vanish... I'll 
try some console-based apps...
> Could you perhaps mention the kde and Xorg versions you are using?
I have konqueror 3.5.5 and Xorg 7.2 on a native amd64 system (gcc 4.1.2 
and glibc 2.5).
