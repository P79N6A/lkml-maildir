Its not clutter -- what you are doing is hiding pieces of the driver
from the driver maintainer.  pcibios_enable_device should not be
cluttered up with such mess, too.
I point out that I recently fixed a bug where Via interrupts were being
assigned incorrectly.  If I had not done a global grep for Via
irq-related code, I would have missed the spot where the PPC code was
doing a kludge for one of the four on-board Via devices, hardcoding the
USB irq number to 11.

Correct.  If your driver uses the API correctly, then when/if we want to
mess around with hotplug resource assignment, we can un-assign resources
as we like.  Since there aren't too many users of pci_disable_device so
far, I want to make sure early adopters get it right.

Can you give a -specific- example of arch code that is -not- sungem
related, but needs to occur when one powers-down a sungem MAC?
If the PM code is related to sungem, it belongs in sungem.
So far I don't see a need for arch-specific hooks anywhere...
