you are right on - user-mode wrappers, a consistent
namespace is what's needed. Sun 'forgot' about that
for many many years and is now left with an OS that's
essentially the same as 20 years ago. 
Data access etc. classes could derive from a well
defined model framework. If someone defines a base
framework (not on the trivial side considering
simplicity/elegance, performance, security,
extensibility needs) then this could get going.
