Given that loop works in this way, I certainly see that as doable,
but then I'd vote for using the existing ioctl semantics of
LOOP_SET_FD and LOOP_DEL_FD on the mtdchar device, which already
comes with an ioctl interface for mtd devices.
I'd probably also allow the LOOP_{GET,SET}_STATUS{,64} commands,
so you can actually use the existing losetup tool.
That way, we wouldn't have to introduce a new API, just extend
an existing one to work on more things.
