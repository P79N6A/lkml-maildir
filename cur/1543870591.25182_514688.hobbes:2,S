The DSDT code clearly can't touch the hardware itself - hardware access 
is carried out by the kernel. If we can identify cases where ACPI reads 
and writes would touch resources claimed by other drivers, that would be 
a good starting point for working out what's going on.
Of course, this ignores the case where the DSDT just traps into SMM 
code. That one is clearly unsolvable.
