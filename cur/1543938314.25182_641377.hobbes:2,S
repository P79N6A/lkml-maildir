Before the change, the peer and master ID's were basically randomly
chosen from the peers, which means, it wasn't possible to always
determine, that two mounts were peers, or that they were slaves to the
same peer group.
After the change, this is possible, since the peer ID will be the same
for all mounts which are peers.  This means, that even though the peer
ID might be in a different namespace, it is possible to determine all
peers within the same namespace by comparing their peer ID's.

I don't think the mount ID itself can be sensitive, it really doesn't
contain any information, other than being an identifier.

Why cifs not displaying '//server/share/subdirectory' as the source of
the mount?
