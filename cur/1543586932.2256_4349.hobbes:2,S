We -can- support multifunction cards such and these, and no we don't
need to hack the infrastructure to do it.  You might need to hack the
subsystem drivers a bit to make them more flexible, but that's it.
WRT the specific example of joystick ports, it is already possible for a
sound driver to register a joystick port.  No problem there either.
