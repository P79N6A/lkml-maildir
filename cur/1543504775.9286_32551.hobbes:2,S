Why worry? We have far more serious races with many other common
admin tools. Consider the "kill" command.
Fixing this might involve adding a unique ID to every part of the
process data, then eliminating the PID concept. That isn't UNIX.
$ ps
                            UPID TTY          TIME CMD
85e4a694805f3e2db8229f66bc289857 pts/2301 00:00:00 bash

Now imagine every process having a dozen of those monster ID numbers.
There are IBM systems that do something like the above. They use a
set of letters carefully selected to avoid the chance of randomly
creating an obscene ID code.

The Linux model can be annoyingly complex. I expect to see plenty of
problems as standards begin to define how tools interact with threads.
Normal process:     does not use clone()
Threaded process:   uses clone() via libc pthreads support
Strange process:    uses clone() more directly
I mostly don't care how strange processes are displayed.
Every clone() flag greatly increases the number of strange types.
You could have horrid mixed processes, with a task that shares
signals with one task and filesystem actions with a different task.
