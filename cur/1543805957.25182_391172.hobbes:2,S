Hi Paul. 
MAX_PXM_DOMAINS is defined in include/acpi/acpi_numa.h.  So I'm confused.
I just built sn2 with Yasunori's patches applied to -mm3. I had previously
built sn2 with a slightly different patch series of mine which Yasunori 
later incorporated most of into this patch series. Would you please send your 
.config and the error output from the build? 
thanks,
bob
