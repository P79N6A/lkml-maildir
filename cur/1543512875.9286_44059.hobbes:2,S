While trying to track down some problems with my old i486 dropping ppp
packets, I ran into some anomalies with /proc/ide.
I have 4 IDE drives and I noticed that /proc/hd[ac]/geometry reports a
negative physical cylinder count while /proc/hd[bd]/geometry reports
positive values. The logical geometries are correct. Is this a problem?
Also, /proc/hd?/settings shows a "multcount" value that is 1/2 that
reported by hdparm. Important?
Thanks.
