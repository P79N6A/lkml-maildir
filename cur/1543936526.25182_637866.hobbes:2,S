I'm still pending to pysically remove the disks (or at least unplug the
cable...), but I have realized a cusious thing: after some errors, the
kernel is lowering the disk speed (UDMA/133, then 100, then 33):

Perhaps this gives a clue.
Or I just had bad luck and 2 of my 4 disks broke at the same time.
