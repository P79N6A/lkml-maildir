 Taskfile DMA path is still broken.  Also calling ide_end_request()
will work there, but IMHO it's just cleaner to finish special commands
inside ide_end_drive_cmd().  Currently,
 * Successful flagged taskfile			-> ide_end_drive_cmd()
 * All other successful non-DMA special cmds	-> ide_end_request()
 * Successful DMA taskfile			-> segfault
 * All failed special cmds			-> ide_end_drive_cmd()
 It just shouldn't be like this.  :-(

 None is on a hot path or even near to one, but maybe I don't have
enough experience with old hardware.  Are there some old hardware
which make the additional reads stand out?

 Yeah, the whole IDE ioctl interface seems disturbingly messy. :-(
 * Register output is available only if
	1. The command fails.
	2. The command is a flagged taskfile.
 * taskfile->device_head is used regardless of outflags setting.
 * In flagged taskfile, taskfile->device_head can turn on the device
   bit, so we can issue commands to hdb with permissions to hda.
 * In TASK and TASKFILE, LBA commands can be issued to drives in CHS
   mode but the reverse isn't true.  However, in TASKFILE, if the
   command isn't flagged, the lower nibble of device register is
   zeroed depending on addressing setting.
 * taskfile->data endianess is reversed on big endian machines.
 * ide_reg_valid_t endianess issue.
 * And, none of above is documented.
 So, I don't know.  Do you think we should keep all of the above
behaviors?  Please let me know; then, I'll update ioctl/hdio.txt so
that people can at least know these gotchas.
 Thanks.
