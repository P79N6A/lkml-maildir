In this case the wrong block is probably been bforgotten in some msec
after he seen the error message. Rebooting immediatly may avoid the
superblock/direntry/inode on-disk update so then fsck may reack the wrong
block and notice the corruption. But in this case allowing fsck to reach
the wrong block won't make any difference (but at least then you'll know
the wrong block was wrong as well on-disk and not only in-memory :).
