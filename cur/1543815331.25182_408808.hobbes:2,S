Hi!  Notice how your new spam-filtering scheme breaks horribly?  
(Hint: look at the CC line)  See how you're going to get  
exponentially more emails every day as people CC the old address  
too?  Can't you just turn off this horrible scheme too and quit  
wasting email bandwidth?  Or at _least_ make it only change monthly.   
And install a decent bayesian filter; mine eliminates all but maybe 3  
spams a week with no more than one false positive a month, and I  
haven't done anything other than train it with a bunch of good and  
bad emails for a few months or so.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
