In Linux, you can enable timestamps on any socket executing:
int val = 1;
setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_TIMESTAMP, &val, sizeof(val));
PD: Current release of tcpdump doesn't mmap the reception ring and
timestamps packets at user space with gettimeofday. It isn't the best
performing alternative, but it's portable.
