Stephen,
the allmodconfig builds at 
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/
 
seem to lack a few drivers even though they are properly enabled in the 
respective config.  Is it simply because everything is rebuilt on top of 
a previous build?
Do you mail only errors to maintainers or also compiler warnings?
Thanks,
