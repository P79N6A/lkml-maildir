Hm. On my box, TSC did not work, until I hacked arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c
in it. 
Neither clock=tsc nor clocksource=tsc didn't have any effect.

Here in Russia electric power is cheap compared with hardware upgrade.

Will try some days later.
Oh, and pppoe-server uses some kind of packet socket too, doesn't it?

I would like some sysctl very much, too. Let tcpdump show imprecise
timestamps when forwarding performance is more important.
After all, Ciscos don't have any tcpdump analog at all, and they are 
very popular :)
