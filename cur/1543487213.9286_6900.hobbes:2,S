 Previously, I was using OSS on this machine, a Dell with the CS4236B
onboard.
 I installed 2.2.2ac2, and got the sound card working with isapnp.  Playing
samples was fine. Alas, when I set my MP3 player running, after a few
minutes, it stutters. Killing the MP3 player, and catting a file to
/dev/audio doesn't seem to be generating any interrupts.
 Is this a known problem ? If not, I can revert to a version that is known
to work with it...
