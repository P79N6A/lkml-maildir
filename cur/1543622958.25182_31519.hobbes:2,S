Has anybody successfully booted from disk on key?
I am trying to see if there is a way to load the whole system, instead
of using it merely as a root disk.
My mother board supports booting from USB disks and my IBM disk on key
has USB interface, so I thought perhaps there is a way...
Thanks
Andrew Park
