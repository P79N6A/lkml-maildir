You still haven't shown the flaw in the logic.  My point is that an
over-reliance on crypto primitives is dangerous, especially given
recent developments.  Fortuna relies on the crypto primitives much
more than /dev/random does.  Ergo, if you consider weaknesses in
crypto primitives to be a potential problem, then it might be
reasonable to take a somewhat more jaundiced view towards Fortuna
compared with other alternatives.
Whether or not /dev/random performs the SHA finalization step (which
adds the padding and the length to the hash) is completely and totally
irrelevant to this particular line of reasoning.  
And actually, not doing the padding does not make the crypto hash
vulnerable to collisions, as you claim.  This is because in
/dev/random, we are always using the full block size of the crypto
hash.  It is true that it is vulernable to extension attacks, but
that's irrelevant to this particular usage of the SHA-1 round
function.  Whether or not we should trust the design of something as
critical to the security of security applications as /dev/random to
someone who fails to grasp the difference between these two rather
basic issues is something I will leave to the others on LKML.
