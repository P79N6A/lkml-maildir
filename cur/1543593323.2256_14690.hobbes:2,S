The XFS people have been using GFP_PAGE_IO for sometime in their
CVS. (getblk is not using GFP_PAGE_IO there, though).

This patch makes perfect sense, but it does not avoid us from writing out
highmem pages (_even_ if the highmem zone has a shortage) in case the
lowmem is under shortage.
We _need_ low memory to writeout high memory, thats my point.
