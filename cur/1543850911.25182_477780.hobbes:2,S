We're supposed to handle those because they happen on real hardware
too with long running SMM handlers. Or at least there was a effort some time ago
to do this. If it wasn't enough we'll likely need to fix the code.

Hmm, mdelay is polling RDTSC and assumes it makes forward progress
and waits until the time that was estimated at the original TSC<->PIT
calibration passed.  While there is a spin loop it is definitely 
polling a timer that is supposed to tick properly even in virtualization.
You're saying that doesn't work on vmware? Does it have trouble
with RDTSC?
Anyways if polling against TSC doesn't work I suppose we could
change it to poll against some other timer.

Yep.

Hmm, why exactly?
