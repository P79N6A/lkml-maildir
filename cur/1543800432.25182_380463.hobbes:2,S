Peter,
I tried your "scan-shared.c" proggy which loops over 140M of a file
using mmap (on a 128MB box). The number of loops was configured to "5".
The amount of major/minor pagefaults was exactly the same between
vanilla and clockpro, isnt the clockpro algorithm supposed to be
superior than LRU in such "sequential scan of MEMSIZE+1" cases?
Oh well, to be sincere, I still haven't understood what makes CLOCK-Pro
use inter reference distance instead of recency, given that its a simple
CLOCK using reference bits (but with three clocks instead of one).
But thats probably just my ignorance, need to study more.
