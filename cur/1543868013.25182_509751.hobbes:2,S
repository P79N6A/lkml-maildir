I am thoroughly confused. Maybe that is because I have not been following 
this issue closely but it seems that you are using the paravirt interface 
as an API for Xen code in the guest? I thought the idea of paravirt was to 
have an API that is generic? This patchset seems to be mostly realizing 
Xen specific functionality? How does the code here interact with KVM, 
VMWare and other hypervisors?
