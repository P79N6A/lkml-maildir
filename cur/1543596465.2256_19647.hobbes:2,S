Yes, so the first FP instruction per process lets "lazy FPU" save/restore

The kernel is not supposed to use floating-point.

I think all you need is this:
/*
 *  Note FPU control only exists per process. Therefore, you have
 *  to set up the FPU before you use it in any program.
 */
#include <i386/fpu_control.h>
#define FPU_MASK (_FPU_MASK_IM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_DM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_ZM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_OM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_UM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_PM)
void fpu()
{
    __setfpucw(_FPU_DEFAULT & ~FPU_MASK);
}
main() {
   double zero=0.0;
   double one=1.0;
   fpu();
   one /=zero;
}

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
