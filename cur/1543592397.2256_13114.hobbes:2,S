Oh, also: the logic behind the change of the kmem_cache_reap() - instead
of making it conditional on the _reverse_ test of what it has historically
been, why isn't it just completely unconditional? You've basically
dismissed the only valid reason for it to have been (illogically)
conditional, so I'd have expected that just _removing_ the test is better
than reversing it like your patch does..
No?
