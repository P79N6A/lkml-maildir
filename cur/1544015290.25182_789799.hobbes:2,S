   ATA block transfers are always mutliple of 512 bytes (except read/write 
long), so this shouldn't be an issue... unless the code is trying to split a 
sector between 2 pages on an arbitrary boundary -- in this case, even if the 
both resulting byte counts divide by 2, you may be busted because of prefetch 
that (as the Intel docs say), should have the initial (start of sector) and 
all subsequent reads of the same size (either 16- or 32-bit). I don't know if 
this situation is actually possible with libata -- but beware...

    The ATAPI logic is more complex since it has to take into account the 
arbitrary byte count that a device want to transfer on each INTRQ (read from 
the byte count low/high regs).
