2.6.19-rc4 + these two patches => doesn't work
2.6.19-rc4 + these two patches + SYSErr removal => works
For reference:
* 2.6.19-rc4 + SYSErr removal => works
So, while these two patches don't fix the problem, they don't seem
to be making things worse, something the MAC address change did do.
cheers,
