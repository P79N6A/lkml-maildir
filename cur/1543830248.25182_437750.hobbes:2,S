Subject: [PATCH 000 of 14] knfsd: Introduction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following are 14 assorted patches for nfsd.
Patches are against 2.6.17-mm2 and are suitable for inclusion in 2.6.18.
Primarily minor bug fixes.
Last three patches are initial support for RPC privacy (i.e. decrypt
the RPC request and encrypt the reply).  This code is sub-optimal in
several ways (memcopys ...) which will probably get tidied up once we
determine the best way to do so.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
