Subject: PATCH/RFC: pci wakeup hooks (2/4)

This adds minimal PCI hooks.  Maybe they should be more minimal.
This makes PCI use the new pmcore wakeup bits.
 - Initialized in pci_enable_device()
 - Disabled in pci_disable_device()
 - Lets userspace change the initial may_wakeup policy.
Previously, wakeup policies were driver-specific (other than ethtool).
This patch lets all drivers outsource such decisions.
NOTE:  the init could presumably be done in probe() and never changed,
except maybe when ACPI and PCI disagree.  But since I (mis?)remember
hearing about devices that choke on capability accesses during probe(),
it's done this way instead.
ALSO:  I think some boards can support system wakeup using signals other
then PME# ... handling wakeup without PCI PM.  Presumably board-specific
logic (ACPI bytecodes?) would kick in to mark the devices appropriately;
playing well with such logic might mean never clearing can_wakeup.
