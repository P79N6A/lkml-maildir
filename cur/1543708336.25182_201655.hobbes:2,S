They do the same as I described. As you wrote, it works most of the
time. That's the whole point. You submit a "proposed" configuration
and gets back something .... most of the time, you do get back what
you asked. But you _might_ not. In some cases, what will happen is
that the "other" head will be affected. For example, enabling
mirroring on a non-4.3 LCD laptop like a titanium powerbook while
having a 4.3 display (CRT) plugged on the second output will cause
the LCD to be resized to a 4.3 ratio in MacOS.
So in this case, you get _more_ than what you asked.

It's meant to be independant of anything else but the actual low
level driver model. Xserver would be one client, but others could
enter the game of course ;)
