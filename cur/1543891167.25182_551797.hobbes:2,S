If you let users alter the kernel keymap, then you need to implement 
support for resetting the kernel keymap on exit. Otherwise it's a 
trivial DoS.

The standard setup for home machines tends to be an account per family 
member. The standard setup in an office environment is likely to be 
multiuser.

No, but it makes it significantly more confusing. User 1 chooses a 
setup. This gets saved. User 2 remaps keys based on User 1's settings 
(which have been restored at bootup). User 1 alters key mapping. User 2 
suddenly becomes hugely confused.

On machines like we're discussing (laptops, basically) it's a tiny 
world. Optimise for the common case, not the rare one.

How many users plug external keyboards with unlabelled keys into a 
laptop? No, I really don't think that's a common case at all.
The solution that satisfies the largest number of users with the 
smallest amount of work is the one where pressing a key on the keyboard 
results in X events being generated. Right now, that requires that the 
key generate a real keycode.
