Shouldnt we force a page fault for not possible cpus in cpu_data
to catch all access to per_cpu(some_object, some_not_possible_cpu) ?
We can use a red zone big enough to hold the whole per_cpu data.
Something like :
file include/asm-x86_64/pgtable.h
#define CPUDATA_RED_ZONE 0xffff808000000000UL  /* start of percpu catcher */
file arch/x86_64/kernel/setup64.c
setup_per_cpu_areas(void)
{
...
     for (i = 0 ; i < NR_CPUS ; i++) {
         if (!cpu_possible(cpu))
             cpu_pda(i)->data_offset = CPUDATA_RED_ZONE - __per_cpu_start ;
     }
}
