Ok, I've updated it. News are:
 - It now requires cpufreq support (it won't start if the cpufreq clamp
sensor isn't loaded). I also changed the Kconfig stuff a bit, you'll
need to enable 2 options now
 - It has some totally untested support for PowerMac9,1
 - It has overtemp support (will slow CPU down and blow fans full speed
if the machine goes overtemp)
 - It has some basic sysfs interface to read values
in /sys/devices/platform/windfarm.0
 - DEBUG is disabled by default
Enjoy !
Ben.
