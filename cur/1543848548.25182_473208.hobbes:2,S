Time to make things clear! Many webpages that compare the sizes of 
kernel evolution levels ("2.2.0 vs 2.4.0 vs 2.6.0") assume it grows 
exponentially. However, if you graph it over time (as Horst suggested), 
you get something that is quite linear. I took the sizes of uncompressed 
tarballs, since the mirror ftp and a good decompressing opteron happens 
to be connected right on the local Ethernet.
