BTW, from my part I can't reproduce it (even without the nr_scanned,
that I'm going to apply too anyway just in case), but my hardware may
have different timings dunno.
All I could reproduce were the swap-token issues (I had a flood of
reports about that too, all fixed by now with my 1-6/4 patches). The
other patches agreed here looks good but I don't have actual pending
bugs on that side and I can't reproduce problems either in basic
testing, so they're applied now for correctness.
Thanks.
