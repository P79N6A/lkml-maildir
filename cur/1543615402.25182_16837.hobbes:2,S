Eric, what are you doing to do if you _do_ detect that there are ISA slots 
present? If there are ISA (not isapnp) cards present, you'll _have_ to 
start asking 'difficult' questions. So why bother to detect the ISA slots 
automatically? Just hide the ISA_SLOTS option in idiotmode. 
I hope you haven't added ISA_SLOTS to the version of CML2 you're intending 
to submit for 2.5, btw. That would violate the agreement which you seem to 
have made that you'd make the first version of CML2 match the existing CML1 
rules as far as possible, and introduce orthogonal changes later in 
individual patches.
