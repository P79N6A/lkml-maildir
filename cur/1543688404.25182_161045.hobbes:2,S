Yeah, I get one of those on boot, too.  Or at least I did.  I was going to 
turn the processor checking stuff back on to see if it happened 
consistently.  What processor is it, Tomasz?  Mine's an Athlon.  Output of 
"cat /proc/cpuinfo" at the end, if anyone's remotely interested...

Thanks for the link, Randy, I'll give it a go tonight.  Although with my 
knowledge of current processor archictecture, I'm guessing it'll parse it 
from one format I don't have a clue about into a more verbose format I don't 
have a clue about ;-)
Cheers,
