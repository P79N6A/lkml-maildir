This one is going to be fun to track down.  So far, with a personal
sample size of three machines, 2.4.0-test12 is stable on two, locks
up in a predictable and repeatable manner on one.  First, the stable
machines:
(1) P150 MMX Toshiba Tecra 730XCDT notebook, egcs-2.91.66, openwin
    with XFree86 3.3.6.
(2) Cyrix 6x86 MII 233, egcs-2.91.66, AfterStep with XFree86 4.0.1,
    NVIDIA-0.9-5 video driver.
The unstable machine:
Gateway PII 333, egcs-2.91.66, AfterStep with XFree86 3.3.6.
Running "startx" as "root" --> ok: no problem.
Running "startx" as normal user --> I get as far as the grey moire
pattern with the black "X" cursor in the center of the screen, and
the machine locks up solid.  Cannot switch consoles, machine doesn't
respond to pings (much less remote access attempts), no disk activity,
no "oops" messages in any of the logfiles.  Absolutely repeatable.
Machine works fine with earlier kernels.
Does anyone have a feeling one way or the other as far as this being
related to the CPU type?  I can try building a pre-PII CPU kernel on
the unstable machine and see if that makes any difference.
