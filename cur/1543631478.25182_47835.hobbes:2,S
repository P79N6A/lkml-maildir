Thank's that is explaining it.
But I would have loved it if it appeared with + in front in
the patch somewhere. That's the only true problem I had.
OK?
BTW.> usb-ohci seems to be a more reasonable name, since
it tells me directly - hey buddy I'm USB the -hcd doen't
tell me anything in addition and is entierly redundant, or
is there a ohci.o module there?
And why not just doing the following.
1. Rename usb-ohci to usb-ohci-old
2. Rename ohci-hcd to usb-ohci
Much less grief and guessing what happens :-).
Just a suggestion.
