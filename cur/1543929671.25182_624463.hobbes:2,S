but they make the code safer. The chip has common register and port
registers, which are randomly splattered over the address range. And
some of them are read only, some write only. Read only and Write
only register live at the same register offset and their function
usually doesn't have anything in common. By using these macros I'll
get compile errors when doing a READ_SC from a write only register
and vice versa. I will also get compile errors, if I try to access a
common register via READ_SC_PORT/WRITE_SC_PORT. 
If there is a better way to get more readable code for you and
the safety I'd like, just tell me.

which he then finds by this name in the data sheet. All the register
names are named as close to the datasheet as possible. And I consider
consulting datasheets when looking at drivers a pretty good idea.

it's no big deal to change that, but is getting bitten by stupid chips
worth it ? I'd prefer to get a compile error than debugging a runtime
error.
