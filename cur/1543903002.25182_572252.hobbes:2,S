Virtualization is hardly x86 specific.  How about moving it to
top-level, and having individual items disable themselves on archs they
don't apply to?
Otherwise we end up with $NARCH copies of that Kconfig, each slightly
different.  The top-level entry can be made to depend on the archs that
actually have some virt capability, so as not to show empty an menu.
