Thanks, I will check the archives. I looked into stat.c stat.h fs.h and
it seems that inodes can only keep one link information (or maybe I'm
wrong).
I am trying to set up a cluster and looking for a _very_ simple
scaleable distributed filesystem solution (the opengfs, lustre patches
didn't work).
Thanks,
Indraneel
