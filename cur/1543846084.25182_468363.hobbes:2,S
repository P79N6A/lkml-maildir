Sure it is wrong, the point is what is the best to understading. "LCD
display" seems better to me than just "LC display".
Maybe "drivers/lcdisplay" and "LCD" in common written places? Then we will have:
tristate "ks0108 LCD controller"
tristate "cfag12864b LCD"
That is the correct spelling, however, does it look good?
(I really don't know what is the best way to write it in english, I'm
spanish and here it is more common to say "LCD display").
