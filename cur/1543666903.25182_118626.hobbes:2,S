   Again: I don't like API at all.
   
   Anycast address management itself in that patch would be ok.
   However, JOIN/LEAVE is NOT useful and userland application will be 
   incompatible with other implementation. (sigh...)
   I think linux likes unicast model (assign address like unicast address), too.
   
Please propose alternative API, or do you suggest not
to export this facility to user at all?
   And, we see __constant_{hton,ntoh}{l,h}() again...
   
I will fix this, thank you for mentioning this.
