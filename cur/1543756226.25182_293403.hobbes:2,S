But the contents of /proc/filesystems comes from the kernel. And the 
order of filesystems comes from the link order.
Let me show you, why it is _not_ pointless:
If you do not have /etc/filesystems, mount will read /proc/filesystems:
# strace -o mount.trace mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /mnt
# grep filesystems mount.trace
open("/etc/filesystems", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/proc/filesystems", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
# grep ^mount mount.trace
mount("/dev/sda1", "/mnt", "squashfs", 0xc0ed0000, 0) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
mount("/dev/sda1", "/mnt", "vfat", 0xc0ed0000, 0) = 0
See? I _have_ that patch applied, that's why it tried vfat and not msdos 
first.
Granted, I could override the default order by using a /etc/filesystems 
file. But the kernel should have a much more sane default on its own, 
namely "try vfat before msdos".
