I've also tested on the same three patches (against 2.6.27.2 here), and 
the patches appear to work just fine. I'm running a similar proxy 
benchmark test to Willy, on a machine with 4 gigabit NICs (2xtg3, 
2xforcedeth). splice is working OK now, although I get identical results 
when using splice() or read()/write(): 2.4 Gbps at 100% CPU (2% user, 
98% system).
I may be hitting a h/w limitation which prevents any higher throughput, 
but I'm a little surprised that splice() didn't use less CPU time. 
Anyway, the splice code is working which is the important part!
