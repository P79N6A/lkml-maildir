	There are big companies out there that require thousands of
disks.  Many don't want to use hardware raid, they just want JBOD.
There are installations today with 2k-4k disks covering the gamut from
massive databases to HPC to research facilities.  Today.
	A 32bit dev_t with the 12/20 Linus split provides 64k minors.
That's 16k disks with our current 15-partitions-per limit.  But if
someone wants 35 partitions (I've seen that somewhere) you're down to
8k.  And the places using 2-4k disks today will be getting to 8k disks
soon after 2.6 becomes usable, if not before.  They will likely hit 16k
disks before 2.6 becomes an afterthought.

	64bit dev_t is not a panacea.  However, if we have to do this
change, we want to do it once.  This only solves the space issue.  All
of the other issues, such as naming, are orthogonal to this change.
Holding one change until everything else has been written is silly.

	There is no conspiracy.  Everyone agrees we need more dev_t
space.  Peter, Andries, and others see it like I do; we only want to do
this once, and we already can see a day when 20bits of minors isn't
enough.
