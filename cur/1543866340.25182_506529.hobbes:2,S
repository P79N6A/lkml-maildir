Hi Linus,
Included in this patchset is:
* A rather involved series of ocfs2 dlm fixes - these were too large (and
  tested too late) to really go into 2.6.20. Mostly this revolves around
  lock migration race fixes. Most forms of migration had been temporarily
  disabled in the ocfs2 dlm due to those problems, but with these patches it
  works great again.
* Some cleanups in heartbeat code, and our section of fs/Kconfig.
* A small configfs fix from Joel.
So nothing major in the feature area for now, just some more bugfixes and
cleanups.
