Nevermind; I'm watching the thread at

This isn't just me.  All the Debian kernels hang too.  I've tried
all of the following:
Linux version 2.6.8-12-amd64-generic (buildd@bester) (gcc version 3.4.4 20050314 (prerelease) (Debian 3.4.3-13)) #1 Mon Jul 17 01:12:05 UTC 2006
Linux version 2.6.8-12-amd64-k8 (buildd@bester) (gcc version 3.4.4 20050314 (prerelease) (Debian 3.4.3-13)) #1 Mon Jul 17 01:39:03 UTC 2006
Linux version 2.6.8-12-amd64-k8-smp (buildd@bester) (gcc version 3.4.4 20050314 (prerelease) (Debian 3.4.3-13)) #1 SMP Mon Jul 17 00:17:20 UTC 2006
The boot messages differ only in trivial ways, and they all end
with:
- ----------
NET: Registered protocol family 16
CPU 0: Machine Check Exception:                7 Bank 3: b40000000000083b
RIP 10:<ffffffff8023a44c> {pci_conf1_read+0xac/0xe0}
TSC d189cea ADDR fdfc000cfe
CPU 0: Machine Check Exception:                7 Bank 0: b40000000000083b
RIP 10:<ffffffff8023a44c> {pci_conf1_read+0xac/0xe0}
TSC 0
Kernel panic: Uncorrected machine check
- ----------
This happens on 4 different machine!  The only way to get them to
boot to a kernel later than 2.6.3 is "nomce".
I assert that an MCE on multiple machines that have been running
successfully on 2.6.2 for *years* is bad kernel behaviour; we have
no reason to believe that 4 different machines that happen to have
identical hardware have all developed the same hardware failure at
the same time.
Is there anything I can do here besides nomce?
Boot messages on Debian kernels from the primary host:

Boot messages from two other hosts booting Debian's 2.6.8-11 amd64
generic kernel; these hosts are used for massive report jobs in
production on a 2.6.2 kernel, so we *know* they work:
