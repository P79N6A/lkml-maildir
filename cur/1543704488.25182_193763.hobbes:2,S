Hija,
I just discovered that the interface doesn't account outgoing bytes, so
although I'm shoveling GBs over NFS to another machine, ifconfig and
/proc/net/dev both state that the card hasn't transmitted anything:
eth2      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:08:01:a3:64:97,
          inet addr:192.168.11.2  Bcast:192.168.11.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:297638 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:1334930 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:45831863 (43.7 MiB)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)
          Interrupt:4 Base address:0xff00
Furthermore the performance is really scary slow: I'm not even getting 
100Base-T speeds from an Athlon XP to my G4 PowerBook under MacOS X over
a PtP connection.
What is interesting though is that the machine produces interrupt errors
which only occur when the card is active:
           CPU0
  0:  110545371          XT-PIC  timer
  1:          2          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  3:      35665          XT-PIC  ohci1394

NMI:          0

And this is this output of the driver at initialisation:
r8169 Gigabit Ethernet driver 1.2 loaded
PCI: Found IRQ 4 for device 00:0d.0
r8169: PCI device 00:0d.0: unknown chip version, assuming RTL-8169

eth2: Identified chip type is 'RTL-8169'.
eth2: RealTek RTL8169 Gigabit Ethernet at 0xe093ff00, 00:08:01:a3:64:97, IRQ 4
eth2: Auto-negotiation Enabled.
eth2: 1000Mbps Full-duplex operation.
