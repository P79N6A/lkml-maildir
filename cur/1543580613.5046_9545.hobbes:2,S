Between 2.4.0 and 2.4.1, a few VM changes were made by
Linus and Marcelo. These are good changes, but they seem
to need a little bit of tuning in related code to get
system behaviour right again.
I'm working on these changes and should have a (few)
rebalancing patches out soon to fix the performance
problem.
About the system hanging completely, I wonder if it goes
away by pressing sysrq-S (sync all disks). If it does,
maybe Reiserfs was blocking all the pages in the inactive
list from being written because one of the active pages
(not a replacement candidate) needed to be written out
first?  Or does the Reiserfs ->writepage() function handle
this?
regards,
Rik
