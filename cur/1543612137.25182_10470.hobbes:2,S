Which interfaces would you consider complicated ? 
I guess currently one would do -
struct yyy {
	int blah1;
	void *blah2;
	int stats;
};
void some_init_routine(struct another_struct *op)
{
	op->yyy = kmalloc(sizeof(struct yyy), GFP_KERNEL);	
	if (op->yyy == NULL)
		return;
	memset(op->yyy, 0, sizeof(struct yyy));
}
void do_something(struct another_struct *op)
{
	op->yyy.stats++;
}
int get_stats(struct another_struct *op)
{
	return op->yyy.stats;
}
statctr just provides interfaces to do all these three operations.
Did I miss something here ?
What would be your ideal way of using a statistics counter ?

Given a parent /proc directory, it would be possible for statctr to
automatically create corresponding proc entries and automatically
reflect the combined per-cpu counter value.
However if you want to club multiple statctrs together in
a single /proc entry, then it gets complicated and it might
just be easier for the driver to maintain its proc entries.
Thanks
