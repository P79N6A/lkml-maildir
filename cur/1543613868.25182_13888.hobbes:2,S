Maxtor 60.0GB 96147U8 5400 RPM (Diamond Max 60, running in ultra/33 mode)
/dev/hdd:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.45 seconds = 18.55 MB/sec
It's been a long time since i looked at the machine, so I don't remember
the mb type, it's using the PIIX4 controller, celeron 500.  The bios
doesn't support over 32 gb, so it's set to none in the bios, and Andre's
patches help Linux pick it up and run optimized.  Stock 2.2.19/20 kernels
run at about half this speed.
