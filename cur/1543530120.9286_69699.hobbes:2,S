  Ah.  Well, /dev/MAKEDEV would appear to need some help then, since it is
creating /dev/sd[ab] and such with a major of 65.  The version that I'm
using (and the latest version I can find, even on freshmeat) is:
	-rw-r--r--   1 31001    31000       10037 Oct 24  1997 MAKEDEV-2.3.1.tar.gz
  Is there something more recent that handles multiple-listings better?
