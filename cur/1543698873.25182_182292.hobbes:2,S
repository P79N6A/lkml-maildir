What Ted is saying is precisely what I have been trying to say for a long
time, he just said it better (thanks Ted).
If you want the rules to work a particular way when they benefit you you
have to be prepared to deal with it when someone else invokes the same 
rules against you.
I'm with Ted on this one, big time.  I agree that it is opening the door to
unbelievable amounts of bad juju from the corporate folks if licenses can
infect across APIs.  I'd personally like it if contracts couldn't do this
either.  The whole thing gives me more willies than the DMCA.
