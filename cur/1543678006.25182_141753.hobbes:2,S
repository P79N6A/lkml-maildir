This is more or less what Al suggested, except that he suggested "traps" are
special vfsmounts that don't have superblocks, dentries, and inodes.

Yes. You can see that happening now with autofs and amd. However it does work
with my suggestion because the "automounter" code just returns a namespace
independent vfsmount, which the VFS can then bind into the appropriate
namespace and the appropriate place.

I think a better way is for the kernel to pass the daemon a file descriptor
attached to the mount point. This would then act as a token representing the
request, and as such it automatically includes the mount point info (struct
file has vfsmount/dentry pointers) and can also be used to manage the lifetime
of the request.
I'd then make there be either a "mount" ioctl/fcntl on that fd that uses the
info stored on the struct file, or perhaps provide an "fmount" syscall (but
you have to be careful - otherwise someone can use an arbitrary
cross-namespace fd to mangle some other namespace).
