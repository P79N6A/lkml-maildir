Yes, I think the way to go right now is to allocate an array of pages and
index into that. We can make the array size a mount option so that the
default can be something reasonable ;)

Yes - times from a test run are below.
    Real  User  Sys
   14.35 3.82 11.99
   16.75 3.62 13.90
   32.12 4.06 15.81
   18.94 3.99 16.69 
   35.18 3.96 15.80
   18.66 3.89 16.44
   52.09 4.24 16.66
   21.25 3.85 17.09
   19.73 4.00 17.20
   35.40 3.88 16.60
So this definitely reproduces elsewhere.
