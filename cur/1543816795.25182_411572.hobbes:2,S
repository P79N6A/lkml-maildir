So from one perspective that is what we are building.  A full featured
jail capable of running an unmodified linux distro.  The cost is
simply making a way to use the same names twice for the global
namespaces.  UML may use these features to accelerate it's own processes.
Virtualization is really the wrong word to describe what we are building.  As
it allows for all kinds of heavy weight implementations, and has an associate
with much heavier things.  
At the extreme end where you only have one process in each logical instance
of the kernel, a better name would be a heavy weight process.  Where each
such process sees an environment as if it owned the entire machine.
