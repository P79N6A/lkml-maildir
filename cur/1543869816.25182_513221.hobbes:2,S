Yes, you are right, sorry.  We have to do this for x86_64, because there are
such holes in there on machines with more than 2 GB of RAM and swsusp chokes
on them if they are not marked.
On i386 we shouldn't really mark reserved areas in the highmem zone(s) as
nosave, because they are handled in a different way.

OK
Can you please test your patch with the loop in e820_mark_nosave_regions()
restricted to the zones below highmem?
