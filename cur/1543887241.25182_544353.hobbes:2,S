If I understand this correctly:
privileged thread                      unprivileged greedy process
kmem_cache_alloc(...)
   adds new slab page from lowmem pool
do_io()
                                       kmem_cache_alloc(...)
                                       kmem_cache_alloc(...)
                                       kmem_cache_alloc(...)
                                       kmem_cache_alloc(...)
                                       kmem_cache_alloc(...)
                                       ...
                                          eats it all
kmem_cache_alloc(...) -> ENOMEM
   who ate my donuts?!
But I think this solution is somehow overkill. If we only care about
this issue in the OOM avoidance case, then our rank reduces to a
boolean.
