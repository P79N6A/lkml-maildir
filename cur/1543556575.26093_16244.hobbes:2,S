how? symlink to /dev/ttyS0, or with console=ttyS0 boot option?

IIRC/AFAIK:
use /dev/console (char, 5,1) for all your programmes and boot the
kernel with serial console support and .
/dev/console will go to serial, but afaik it doesn't block for lack of
a terminal. (has something to do with /dev/console being semantically
different to /dev/tty..., eg it doesn't block, not sure of the exact
details).
