I don't consider that a good argument...  But that may be just me.  I
mean, why shouldn't /proc/cpuinfo be of any interest to any tools?  It
may be that it isn't because it can't be parsed in a portable manner.
There is information in there that isn't available in /proc/stat.
But since /proc/stat calls that chip in the big socket a "cpu", I'd at
least consider changing the string in the i386 /proc/cpuinfo from
"processor" to "cpu".  I haven't checked to see if the other ports use
something other than "cpu", though.
Anyway, this is just a pedantic thing.  After all, if no tools use it,
it shouldn't hurt to change it and make it consistent, now would it?
