Hi,
 I am a newbie to this list. I am trying to trace a tcp packet in the
Linux Kernel. I got stuck at tcp_send_skb(). Here i know that
ip_queue_xmit() is called. But what i don't understand is how does it get
called. 
I presume in ip_output.c, in ip_queue_xmit() , skb->dst->output(skb) calls
dev_queue_xmit()..Can anyone tell me what goes on after this....
Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
thanks
Sukesh
