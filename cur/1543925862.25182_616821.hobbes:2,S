"fool who broke it" are hard works. Bugs are part of software 
development, so you'd have to name everyone who develops software
a fool.
But the main point is that often you don't know who broke it until you 
know which commit broke it.

I did bisecting myself, and I know that it costs time and work.
But the first point is the above one that it makes otherwise nearly 
undebuggable problems debuggable and fixable.
Another point is that it shifts the work from the few experienced 
developers to the many users. Users (and voluntary testers) we have
many, but developer time for debugging bug reports is a quite scarce 
resource.
And why "poor bloke"? Bisecting takes time, but that's not different 
from e.g. writing code or cleaning up code or going through bug reports.
