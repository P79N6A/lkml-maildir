Could you clarifiy that to either (a) "the kernel is now broken
completely for CF," (b) "use the non-kernel 3.1.33 pcmcia," or (c) "use
XXX." It's not clear to me if you are stating that CF no longer works at
all, not longer works with taskfile, no longer works but pcmcia separate
modules do, or that I need some other software "new subdriver" not in the
kernel or pcmcia package.
I'm not matching any of those to uni laptops working with kernel plus OLD
pcmcia support for pcmcia in kernel, and SMP not working with any
combination of recent kernel (plain, -jam, -ac, -aa, with patches, etc)
and any pcmcia.
