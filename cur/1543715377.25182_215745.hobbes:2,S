Subject: [PATCH] isofs "default NLS charset not used" fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello again,
Since nobody has made any suggestions about the behaviour mentioned
above being a feature and not a bug, I took a liberty to fix it - if
changing one constant in one line of C code can be called "fixing".
The attached diff has been made against vanilla 2.6.5 kernel sources. A
bit of context changing will be in order for it to apply to 2.4.26
because of filesystem options structure type having changed; I haven't
looked at 2.2.
Regards,
