Folks,
First my apologies - I hadn't realised until shown the error of my ways <g>
that I had sent the request to linux-kernel instead of linux-admin.  (The
result of having too many mailing lists in my malbox!)
Secondly, many thanks to all those who - despite it being the wrong group -
still took time to make valid suggestions.  The consensus was firstly to
upgrade both RedHat and Apache, which I am in the process of doing.  The
rest of the suggestions I will follow up in due course.
To those who suggested www.apache.org - I wasn't able at the time to find 
what I needed to know, or at least to know if there was other more up-to-date
information that I should be aware of.  To those who sent patronising and/or
pig-ignorant replies ... *&^!"£$!!!!
Thanks again
John
