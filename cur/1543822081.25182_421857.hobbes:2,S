It's even worse: load average used to mean the number of runnable 
processes + number of processes waiting on disk or NFS I/O to complete, 
a fairly bogus measure as you have noted, but with the aio interfaces 
one can issue enormous amounts of I/O without it being counted in the 
load average.
To make such decisions real, one needs separate counters for cpu load 
and for disk load on the devices one is actually using.
