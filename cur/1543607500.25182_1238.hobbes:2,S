Hi
Some addition: the kernel (at least the 2.4.11-pre6 worked well with the 
tape streamer before the day I replaced the external RAID chassis (broken
display) with a new one. My personal guess in this case is that the 
new RAID has a different firmware and maybe a bug that triggers the crash-
condition whenever a second device (here the scsi tape) tries to use the
bus, too.
Would this scenario fit into your idea of the bug?  
bye,
