Here's another possibility: Freeze the workqueue that
call_usermodehelper uses (remember that code I didn't push hard enough
to Andrew?), and let invocations of call_usermodehelper block in
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE. In refrigerating processes, don't choke on kernel
processes in that state. Of course if you won't want the freeze
processes for str, but do want to freeze call_usermodehelper, I guess
you'd still need the in_suspend() macro.
Regards,
Nigel
