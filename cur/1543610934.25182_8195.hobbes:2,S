When the maintainer did the build on their system, the timestamps were
right.  The moment the change is converted to a patch and sent for
inclusion in the kernel, timestamp order cannot be guaranteed, the
final result on kernel.org may have the base file being older or newer
than the generated output.  kbuild 2.4 is completely broken for
generated files, tthe only reason it "works" is because most of these
files do not change.
kbuild 2.5 fixes this problem.  It knows that you can never rely on
timestamps when you ship both a base file and a file that has been
generated from it.  Instead it uses checksums to detect any changes,
that is part of the gory details that were omitted from the previous
mail.

I have fixed _every_ such case in 2.5.  It is unfixable in 2.4, the
order of timestamps on generated and shipped files is not reliable.
