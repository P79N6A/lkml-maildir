.. and especially those, who use free email services with

  The  linux-kernel  list has VERY HIGH TRAFFIC VOLUME.
( ok, you know that by now ;-) )
When we sysadmins see some subscriber bouncing with "mailbox full",
or something of that theme, we just bluntly cancel such subscriptions.
For obvious reasons we can't inform the user of this fact either.
This list has several archives, see links at:
