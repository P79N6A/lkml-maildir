I think this has been covered before, but I still see no solutions around.
ppp link to ISP, and all TCP conections seem to die after a few dozen K
have been received.  I usually run 2.3/4 but because of the high amount of
oopsing I've gone back to 2.2 until things setlle abit in 2.4.  But now I
have this TCP problem.
My pppd is 2.3.11.  Any comments?  I will have to go back to 2.3.99 for
the time being....
