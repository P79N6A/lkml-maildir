Hmm,
I removed "if (received > 0) {" and tested it something like 3 hours and 
wasn't able to crash the driver. I will test it for couple more hours 
tomorrow and if I'm not still able the crash it, we may have find some 
sort of a solution.
I'm not sure yet if it's a good one because of that earlier crash I had.
I guess I will also test if
- read the interruption status word that the driver will ack before the
  actual processing is done;
has something to do it.
We'll see.. I'll get back to you tomorrow with more information.
