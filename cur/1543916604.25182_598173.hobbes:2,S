Hi Andrew,
Following Christoph Hellwig's suggestion, aiming at a Linux Kernel Markers
inclusion for 2.6.24, I made a simplified version of the Linux Kernel Markers.
There are no more dependencies on any other patchset.
The modification only involved turning the immediate values into static
variables and adapting the documentation accordingly. It will have a little more
data cache impact when disabled than the version based on the immediate values,
but it is far less complex.
Since things have not moved much in the markers area recently (most of the
concerns were about the immediate values), I expect it to be ready for 2.6.24.
It applies to 2.6.23-rc7-mm1
Patches apply in this order:
seq_file_sorted.patch
module.c-sort-module-list.patch
kconfig-instrumentation.patch
linux-kernel-markers-architecture-independent-code.patch
linux-kernel-markers-instrumentation-menu.patch
linux-kernel-markers-documentation.patch
linux-kernel-markers-port-blktrace-to-markers.patch
