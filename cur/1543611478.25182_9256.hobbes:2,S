Hi to all!
*** PLEASE, respond directly to mauricio@infohit.si (I'm not subscribed)

I have a question about network interface naming in linux 2.4.x or 2.2.x
Is it possible to define a name for each interface instead of having
eth0, eth1 etc?
I'm using a linux box dedicated for routing & filtering and I would like
to have descriptive interface names such as:
public, private, branch etc...
so the output of ifconfig (and all other commands dealing with
interfaces) would be more 'concrete'
Is it possible? How?
Thanks a lot!
mauricio
