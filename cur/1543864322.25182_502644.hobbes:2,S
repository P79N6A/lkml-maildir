FWIW, I just tried it with 2.6.20-rc6, and can confirm.  Once nero is
run, the kernel never gives up retrying whatever command failed, so I
get...
[ 4362.972995] hdd: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete
DataRequest }
[ 4362.981475] ide: failed opcode was: unknown
[ 4362.986183] hdd: drive not ready for command
endlessly.
