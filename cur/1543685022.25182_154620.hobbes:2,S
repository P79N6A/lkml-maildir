check_region() was racy.  Use request_region() instead.
   if (!request_region(iop, ASC_IOADR_GAP, "advansys")) {
   ...
   if (!request_region(iop_base, ASC_IOADR, "advansys")) {
   ...
Of course, if successful, this assigns the region to the driver,
while check_region() didn't do this, so release_region() should be
used as needed to return the resources.
