Suspend2_core was just to keep things nicely separated for the moment.
I've already shifted everything into kernel/power after Pekka's email.
Regarding non essential stuff, the compression and encryption parts are
really quite small. LZF Compression doubles the speed, and encryption is
considered important by people who care about security. It also helps
you see why the plugin stuff is useful. Of course plugin isn't really
the right name anymore - it's more of an internal api.
