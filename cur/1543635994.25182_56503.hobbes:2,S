The bad news is that it seems that the automounters are part of the GUIs and 
not well enough documented. There should be:
-	Something like the Solaris volume manager that is part of the base OS 
	and kernel folks should forbid GUI folks to add such tasks to the GUI
-	The volume manager should have a documented interface that allows 
	programs like e.g. cdrecord to gain exclusive access to a CD drive.
Then the problem above could be solved.
