One reason for it would be that it would be more efficient. All the various
shared state needed for POSIX thread group emulation could be put into a 
single structure with a single reference count.
With clone flags you need one pointer in task_struct per flag and
handling of the reference count for each data structure and allocation/freeing
from various slabs for a real fork.
(basically lots of atomic operations at fork time + bloating of task_struct)
