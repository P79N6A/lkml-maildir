If I recall correctly (I sold my DTC-3181E), you need to use the
sym53c400 driver with dtc3181e= option (check the sym53c400 code or
README in drivers/scsi/ for the exact syntax), not the g_NCR5380 driver.
It used to work for me, but I don't recall which kernel version, likely
2.2.18 or something.
Better get a real adaptor if you have a spare PCI slot though... the
DTC-3181E doesn't do DMA as far as I know and will hardly exploit the
Fast-SCSI bandwidth to the full extent: ISA is the bottle's neck.
