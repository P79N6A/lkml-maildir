Why not just use GNATS and CVS, which are available now? They seem
adequate for *BSD. B.t.w. using FBSD -current as well, I must say that
somehow they do manage to have the development branch (4.0) with lots
of innovation going on stay rock solid, let alone the official -stable
branch (which gets lots of backports of fixes and safe improvements
from -current).
I really like Linux features, good hardware support etc but I think it
is such a pity it doesn't try to borrow a bit more from the good
things of other free projects.
