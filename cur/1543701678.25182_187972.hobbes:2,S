The poll state is not maintained at all _between_ calls to poll/select
at the moment, so at least one fresh call to ->poll is required per
file descriptor.  That is something that can be changed.

The impression I had was that the code is quite complicated and
invasive, and select/poll aren't considered worth optimising because
epoll is an overall better solution (which is true; optimising
select/poll would change the complexity of the slow part but not
reduce the complexity of the API part, while epoll does both).
