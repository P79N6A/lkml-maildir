I think "random minor benchmark" was an apt description, yes.;-)
First we will debug it fully. Then we will figure out how to change
mongo so that the files do not consist entirely of the letter a as their
contents, and run mongo on it. Probably we will find some way to slice
up a linux kernel tar file into files of random sizes, and assume that
is a fair thing to let it compress during mongo. Then, just so people
won't think mongo is slanted in our favor we will do some cp -r's of
large numbers of linux kernel source trees and time that also.
