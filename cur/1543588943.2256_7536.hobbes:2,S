Unfortunately it displays only the values. Dumping numbers and strings 
without knowing their meaning (and probably not even the order) is not very 
useful.

But the one-value per file approach is MORE work. It would be less work to 
create XML and factor out the directory structure in user-space :)
Devreg collects its data from the drivers, each driver should contribute the 
information that it can provide about the device.
Printing a few values in XML format using the functions from xmlprocfs is as 
easy as writing
proc_printf(fragment, "<usb:topology port=\"%d\" portnum=\"%d\"/>\n",
                get_portnum(usbdev), usbdev->maxchild);
Extending the devreg output with driver-specific data means registering a 
callback function that prints the driver's data. The driver should use its 
own XML namespace, so whatever the driver adds will not break any 
(well-written) user-space applications. The data is created on-demand, so the 
values can be dynamic and do not waste any space when devreg is not used. 
The code is easy to read and not larger than a solution that creates static 
/proc entries, and holding the data completely static would take much more 
memory. And it takes less code than a solution that would create the values 
in /proc dynamically because this would mean one callback per file or a 
complicated way to specify several values with a single callback.
