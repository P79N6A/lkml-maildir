I don't follow that reasoning. Even broken drivers(board support files,
whateever) are better than non.
Take ArcNet support forinstance. Clearly it hadn't been used in any 2.6
kernel up until around 2.6.10. It was highly broken (call to
uninitialized function pointer). But I needed it. I fixed it and send the
patch so it works from 2.6.11 and up.  If the driver had been dropped in
the 2.6 series because nobody actively maintained it, I  wouldn't have got
around to fix it at all and was probably forced to use another OS for my
perpose.  
But because the driver was still in there and somebody had made sure it
was updated along the changes to the API in the 2.6 kernel, it was easy
for me to fix it although I didn't know so much about the kernel internals
at that time.
