AFAICS getblk_fops() had returned some shit. Not NULL (that would be OK),
but pointer to the unmapped kernel memory. With the obvious results.
Relevant code:
        if (!bdev->bd_op)
		bdev->bd_op = get_blkfops(MAJOR(inode->i_rdev));
	if (bdev->bd_op) {
		ret = 0;
		if (bdev->bd_op->open)

			       There you go.
->bd_op turned out to be...
Aaargh. OK, I see now. It's a combination of my fsckup (fixed unnoticed in
the later patches, but they are still not in the kernel) and some mess with
IDE.
	Scenario:
first attempt to open the bloody thing brings the module in core, registers
something and then ->open() fails. We forget to clean ->bd_op. Then the
driver is unloaded and the next blkdev_open() oopses.

However, something got fishy with IDE proper - it's not a complete solution.
There was some definitely IDE-generated complaints in syslog. Fix of my fsckup
is obviously correct (if we failed open and there is nobody else who keeps the
thing opened we have no right to keep the ->bd_op, cause the module may be
unloaded), but that's not the whole story...
Linus, please apply the patch above. It's against vanilla 2.3.41.
