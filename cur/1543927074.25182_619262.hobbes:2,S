I think it's this stuff:
        #ifdef CONFIG_OUT_OF_LINE_PFN_TO_PAGE
        struct page *pfn_to_page(unsigned long pfn)
        {
                return __pfn_to_page(pfn);
        }
        unsigned long page_to_pfn(struct page *page)
        {
                return __page_to_pfn(page);
        }
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(pfn_to_page);
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(page_to_pfn);
        #endif /* CONFIG_OUT_OF_LINE_PFN_TO_PAGE */
        
Which comes from:
        
        config OUT_OF_LINE_PFN_TO_PAGE
                def_bool X86_64
                depends on DISCONTIGMEM
        
and only on x86_64.  Perhaps it can go away with the
discontig->sparsemem-vmemmap conversion.
