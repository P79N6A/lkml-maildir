I've also merged Nick's "mm: madvise avoid exclusive mmap_sem".
- Nick's patch also will help this problem.  It could be that your patch
  no longer offers a 2x speedup when combined with Nick's patch.
  It could well be that the combination of the two is even better, but it
  would be nice to firm that up a bit.  Chewing a page flag is an expensive
  thing to do.
  I do go on about that.  But we're adding page flags at about one per
  year, and when we run out we're screwed - we'll need to grow the
  pageframe.
- I need to update your patch for Nick's patch.  Please confirm that
  down_read(mmap_sem) is sufficient for MADV_FREE.

The comment should be inside the second `if' statement.  As it is, It
looks like we reinstate the page if (PageLazyFree(page) && !migration).
