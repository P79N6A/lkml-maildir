Hi Marek!
I had a similar problem and for me there were two solutions.
1. Disable ACPI (for example with the 'acpi=off' boot option)
  This was no major impact for me as ACPI never worked here well...
2. Revert the pci-init-ordering-fix from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.5/2.5.70/2.5.70-mm8/broken-out/pci-init-ordering-fix.patch
  This may be only suboptimal, as this patch seems to fix some problems...
Best regards
