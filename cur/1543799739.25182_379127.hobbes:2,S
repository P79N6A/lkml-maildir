You can use filp->f_mapping here, remove the inode* argument.

The bdi_write_congested() test probably isn't doing anything useful: it
only returns true if there's really heavy writeout in progress.  Possibly
you could look at the disk queue accounting stats, work out how much I/O
has been happening lately.

The superblock lifetime handling all looks OK to me.
However I wonder if all this code would become simpler if we were to just
tweak writeback_inodes() a bit: if the superblock was mounted with MS_FLUSH
then temporarily set wbc->sync_mode to WB_SYNC_ALL.
If we do that, the regular wb_kupdate() will sync all the IS_FLUSH
filesystems for us at dirty_writeback_centisecs intervals.  That's a bit
less flexible, but probably less code.
(Alternatively, add a new writeback_control.ms_flush_only boolean.  Set
that, then reuse some of the code in mm/page-writeback.c in some manner).
You abandoned the flush-file-in-release() idea?  That seemed faily neat. 
What was the thinking here?
