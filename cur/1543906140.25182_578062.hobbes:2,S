I see there's debate about whether this (and its fellows) give the
right semantic to whiteouts; and I've not begun to think about that.
But as a patch to tmpfs for what you're trying to do, it looks just
about fine.  I say "just about" because the reference counting looks
right, but I wouldn't dare say that it _is_ right without testing.
And I'd probably want to add a minor adjustment, so that a mount with
nr_inodes=1000 could still support exactly 1000 inodes, despite your
allocating one for the whiteout (usually never used) at mount time.
But that can follow along later, no problem.
