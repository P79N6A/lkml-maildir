I think that's rather unfair, Squashfs is significantly better than 
cramfs.  The main aim of Squashfs has been to achieve the best 
compression (using zlib of course) of any filesystem under Linux - which 
it does, while also being the fastest.  Moving beyond the 4Gb limit has 
been a goal, but it has been a secondary goal.  For most applications 
4Gb compressed (this equates to 8Gb or more of uncompressed data in most 
usual cases) is ok.

Almost everything can be fixed given enough time and money. 
Unfortunately for Squashfs, I don't have much of either.  I'm not paid 
to work on Squashfs and so it has to be done in my free time. I'm hoping 
to get greater than 4Gb support this year, it all depends on how much 
free time I get.
