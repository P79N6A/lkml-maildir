You are contradicting yourself.
Anyway, non-absolute path names passed to the functions mean the
behavior is unspecified.  No portable application must ever do this.  It
is enforced for this reason plus if there comes a time when we want to
do something special which doesn't conflict with standard-compliant
behavior we have a possibility for that.  Unlike wh6at you think, the
tests *are* useful.
