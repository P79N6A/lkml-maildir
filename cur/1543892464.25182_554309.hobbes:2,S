Indeed.
It does :)

I suspect there is a problem writing to the consoles...
I recompiled (rc4+patch) with sysrq support, suspended, resumed and tried 
sysrq-t but got no output.
I *can* change VTs and see the various login prompts, bitmap messages and the 
console messages. Caps/Num lock lights work.
Fearing incompetence I tried sysrq-s sysrq-u sysrq-b and got a reboot so sysrq 
is OK.
Any suggestions on how to see more? Or what to try next?
Any other kernel debug options to set?
David
