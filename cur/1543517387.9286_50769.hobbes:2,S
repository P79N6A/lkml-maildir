Yes, but imho redrawing frame buffer console blocks the kernel, scheduling,
IRQ processing, right ? If so, it's possible to remain only a few kilobytes
to play for DMA, and it can't play newer buffer block since end of dma
irq or so is not received since IRQs are locked during frame buffer console
redrawings. Or I'm wrong and even during this scheduling and IRQ receiving is
enabled ?
(maybe something kernel thread would be usefull for framebuffer updates
because scheduler can schedule it as well ...)
