Unfortunately ksymoops cannot resolve the EIP and trace because it
falls within a module that does not export symbols, probably raid0.  If
you get the latest ksymoops plus the modutils patches from
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops
 you will be able to resolve those
addresses the next time the problem occurs.  Assuming that you load all
modules with the patched modutils.
