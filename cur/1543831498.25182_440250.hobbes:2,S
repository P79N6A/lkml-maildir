Already NAK'd at least a half dozen times.
Yes it works great if your system is wired up to use VID#C,
but what if it isn't ?  It's got a 1 in 4 chance of working,
and what it'll do in the other 3 cases is anyones guess.
As there's no way to tell which VID is in use, the only
option on these systems is to use either the acpi
mode of this driver, or acpi-cpufreq instead.
