Hi Raúl,
I've been using 2.4.19 for a couple of months already. Generally
speaking, I've had no probls with it. I recently found out its IDE
subsystem doesn't get along too well with VIA chipsets (replaced my old
mobo for a VT8233 based recently and probls started surfacing).
Basically, I am unable to rip audio tracks from my cds
(/var/log/messages logs a lot of timeouts).
This is a real PITA, but kernel folks are already aware of it and and
it's going through major reimplementation on 2.5.x branch, AFAIK. Also,
I've seen increasing activity on VIA's Linux forums (this issue has
surfaced a couple of times there as well), so there's hope VIA might
start working closer to the Linux community.
Aside from this, I've been using it daily at home, for all sorts of
things.
HTH,
Andre
