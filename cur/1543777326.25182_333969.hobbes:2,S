Hmm, I'm not aware of anywhere in XFS where we do that.  From talking
to some colleagues here, they're claiming that we can't be doing that
since it'd trip an assert in the IRIX mrlock code.

I'm not yet sure in what situations we are doing this, so can't
really say.  It'd be interesting to see an implementation of the
downgrade_write functionality and then a specific case where the
above locking behaviour happens ... and I'd then be able to say
how tricky that would be to resolve.
Steve, are you aware of situations where we unlock in a different 
thread to where we acquired the lock?  It'd surprise me, as we're
holding these things for as short a time as possible - afaict the
transactions always ilock, copy delta to iclog, pin, and unlock,
no?  (all in the same thread).  I can't see the iolock being used
in this way anywhere either... you?
cheers.
