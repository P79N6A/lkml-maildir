I have two comments on that code, first that it is some of the ugliest
code I've seen in a while in terms of goto's, unintuitive tests, etc. And
the patch adds a goto to avoid duplicating the test for the missing id,
which really could be made more readable. If I thought a patch just to
make the code readable and maintainable would be accepted I'd write it
(while I have a flow diagram in front of me), but given the recent
discussion of path acceptable lately I won't bother. The code really is
uglier than a hedgehog's asshole, though.
MORE IMPORTANT: doesn't this imply that the device id has either been lost
or not initialized? I haven't finished grepping for calls to this code
yet, but intuitively I would guess that if we don't have the id all the
other stuff might be suspect as well.
