Further to my other response on this (yeah, I know, I should think
first).
Where the BIOS author and 'work aggregator' are different organisation
with no shady backroom links (other than the usual industry cabal(TINC)
of course) then it's clear.
When they are the same organisation then the derivedness state is a lot
less clear and more "discoverable", leading to a higher risk of ambush
by litigation.
This isn't specific to any particular licence, but it's something that
the "intent" theory of hardware limitations being a GPL3 violation makes
extra dangerous, because that clause can be used as a hook to drag a
claim through summary judgement (IMHO, IANAL, etc)

       I didn't clarify that I was writing from a devil's advocate
       position in an alternative reality where Tivo was illegal
       purely due to "intent" )
