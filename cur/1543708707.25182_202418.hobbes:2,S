console pass through is the hard one as it is done outside of kgdb under 
interrupt control.  Thus the '+' will come to the interrupt handler.
There is a bit of a problem here WRT hiting a breakpoint while waiting for this 
'+'.  Should only happen on SMP systems, but still....

What are you referring to as "continues".  How is this different from connect to 
a waiting kernel?   Usually this would be the end of the session.  If you are 
going to continue from here something needs to be done with the breakpoint that 
gdb does not know about.  If kgdb can remove them, well fine, except your 
stopped on one.  If you remove it, there could be some confusion as to why you 
are in the debugger.  This would be a fine time for a note to the user from 
kgdb.  It is too bad that the interface does not admit to such a thing.
To overcome, to some extent, this limitation I invented the struct kgdb_info 
which contains bits of information on kgdb's internal state, some of which can 
be modified to control kgdb.  It also contains information on the "other" cpus 
and where we found them.  Also flags on what to do with them when single 
stepping and continuing.
For the last one, there's
