Hi all,
Quilt 0.43 has been released ten days ago (sorry for being slow). A
number of improvements may be of interest to kernel developers so I am
announcing it here on LKML.
Quilt 0.43 can be downloaded from here:
  
http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/quilt/quilt-0.43.tar.gz
Bug fixes:
  Deleting the top patch works again,
  patch delimiter ("---") is no more eaten on refresh.
Compatibility:
  Huge efforts have been put into improving compatibility with many
  platforms. The git specific patch format extensions are better
  supported too.
New features:
  The mail command has been completely reworked,
  delete -r physically removes the deleted patch,
  delete --backup makes a backup copy of the deleted patch,
  annotate -P annotates a previous version of the file,
  import can preserve or merge comments when updating a patch,
  push detects reversed patches,
  diffstat options can be specified,
  patch delimiter ("---") is automatically inserted before diffstat.
Thanks,
--
Jean Delvare
