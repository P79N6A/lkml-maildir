This was the second oops the kernel produced--it wasn't syncing so I
copied it from the screen. The first one I didn't record as I'd thought it
might be related to a power surge we had.

Hmm.. I don't think modules were unloading, though it's very possible that
usage counts were going down for exactly that sort of reason. The first
oops occurred within minutes of system boot; the second was a few hours. I
think the common element might have been mildly high system load--this
machine is used by a PhD student running models on a mysql database on
the SCSI system.
Anyway, it's gone back to 2.4.9-ac18 now which it was running happily
until the power problems. I do have two other machines with the exact same
2.4.17 build (but different initrds) which both auto{,u}mount a lot more
than the problem box, but they have other differences (no SCSI, different
VIA IDE chipset..)
Cheers though,
Matt
