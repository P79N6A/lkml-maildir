Currently, it's not hotpluggable (will be hotpluggable in the future).
Here is a sample AML code to explain what my firmware is doing.
Device (PCI0) {
	Device (P2PA) {
		Device (P2PB) {	// for I/O unit (A)
			Name (_ADR, ...)
			Method (_STA) { ... }
		}
		Device (S0F0) {	// for I/O unit (B)
			Name (_ADR, ...)
			Method (_STA) { ... }
			Method (_EJx) { ... }
			Method (_SUN) { ... }
		}
		...
	}
	...
}
If the I/O unit (A) is connected, _STA of P2PB returns as present
and _STA of S0F0 returns as not present.
If the I/O unit (B) is connected, _STA of P2PB returns as not
present and _STA of S0F0 returns as present.

No, it doesn't. But what I wanted to say was we should not use _SUN
value of non-existing device object.

I think this is the real reason. My platform implements ACPI 2.0 or
later. I didn't notice the chage to_EJx definition. Maybe we need to
check ACPI version in pci_slot driver.

The reason is very simple. The reason is your patch is evaluating
invalid _SUN method. We must skip non-existing device object. This
is what your patch is already doing for pci root bridges.
In addition, even if those _SUN method were changed to return unique
number, none of the problems would be solved. Maybe pci_slot driver
would detect many unknown slots.
