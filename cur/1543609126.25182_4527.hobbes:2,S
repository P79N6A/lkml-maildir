There is a little problem with RTC, though:
While you can set it up to generate interrupts at say 1024 Hz, you can't
read any value of how much time passed since last interrupt. You can do
this on the PIT (i8253), and this is the part that is buggy.
TSC is perfect, precise and accurate, but not reliable in long term.
Some CPUs do thermal throttling, notebooks play with CPU speed, etc,
etc. And it's not synchronized to any interrupt source.
Ugly, ugly, ugly is the PC architecture.
