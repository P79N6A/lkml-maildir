Since the isdn4linux mailing list didn't come up with any answers, this  
time I'm crossposting to linux-kernel.
-- start repost --
This is the 2.1.12 sources from ftp.kernel.org, and the HiSax driver  
compiled into the kernel (but having it as a module didn't change  
anything).
It's only with the modem emulation (X.75). And not with every software.
Diald doesn't seem to have any problems.
Minicom works the first time on every ttyIx, but after quitting the device  
is in the weird state.
A shell script trying to do connections with chat (which worked before, of  
course) puts the device in the weird state before it even manages the ATZ.
In the weird state, the device does not take any input:
root@khms tty8 ~ # ps lwwwft7
  F   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   VSZ  RSS WCHAN  STAT TTY        TIME COMMAND
100     0   768     1   0   0  2100 1280 wait4  S    tty7       0:00 -bash
000     0  4907   768   0   0  2064 1308 write_ S    tty7       0:00 minicom -s
isdn
root@khms tty8 ~ # strace -p 4907
write(3, "\r", 1 <unfinished ...>
root@khms tty8 ~ #
I've never found a way to get the device out of this state again, short of  
reboot. (If modularized, the modules are busy and not unloadable.) If I  
"just" take the next ttyIx, that works until I do one of the above things.
Any idea what happens here? What's the thing that puts the device in this  
state (so I can avoid it in my script, and possibly find a patch for  
minicom), and how could that be undone? And is this a kernel or user bug?
