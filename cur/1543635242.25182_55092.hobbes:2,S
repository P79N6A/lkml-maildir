Ok, I'll outline my personal favourite interface, but I'd also better
point out that while I've thought a bit about what I'd like to have and
how it could be implemented in the kernel, I have _not_ actually tried any
of it out, much less thought about what the user level stuff really needs.
Anyway, here goes a straw-man:
 - I'd associate each profiling event with a dentry/offset pair, simply
   because that's the highest-level thing that the kernel knows about and
   that is "static".
 - I'd suggest that the profiler explicitly mark the dentries it wants
   profiled, so that the kernel can throw away events that we're not
   interested in. The marking function would return a cookie to user
   space, and increment the dentry count (along with setting the
   "profile" flag in the dentry)
 - the "cookie" (which would most easily just be the kernel address of the
   dentry) would be the thing that we give to user-space (along with
   offset) on profile read. The user app can turn it back into a filename.
Whether it is the original "mark this file for profiling" phase that saves
away the cookie<->filename association, or whether we also have a system
call for "return the path of this cookie", I don't much care about.
Details, details.
Anyway, what would be the preferred interface from user level?
