Oh yes, this part is.  If you don't ensure this, everything
breaks.
At the end of an I/O operation, say to a page cache page, that
data ought to be visible equally to a userspace vs. a kernel
space mapping to that page.
For example, this is why we use language about "cpu visibility" in the
DMA api documentation and not "kernel cpu visibility" :-)  And because
PIO transfers are basically pseudo-DMA they need to make the same exact
guarentees.
If you've been living in a world where you didn't think this is
necessary, I certainly feel bad for you :-)
