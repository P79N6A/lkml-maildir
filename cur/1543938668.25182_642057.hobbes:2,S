Ping...  sata_nv status is still a bit open for 2.6.24, and I would like 
to move us forward a bit.
* Kuan's patch...  it has been confirmed (and is needed), correct?  can 
someone work up a good patch for 2.6.24?  The only one I ever received 
was badly word-wrapped, and at the time, Robert seemed uncertain of it, 
so I waited.
* ADMA ATAPI 4GB issues...  playing tricks with the ordering of 
allocations and DMA masks is just way too fragile.  We just cannot 
guarantee that all allocators work that way.  The obvious solution to me 
seems to be hardcoding the consistent DMA mask to 32-bit, but using 
64-bit for regular dma mask if-and-only-if ADMA is enabled.
* it sure seems like there are other open sata_nv ADMA issues -- can we 
hard-confirm or deny this?  bugzilla wasn't very helpful for me.  It 
doesn't seem like we can disable ADMA (to solve those issues) and get 
enough test time in (which is what I said a week (or more?) ago too...)
It seems like we should be able to tackle the first two issues promptly, 
at least.
