Well, I'll defer to you on this.... All I remember was when I worked at
Kubota years ago and was doing a driver for a TurboChannel card that sent
a 100MB/s stream of intermixed data and graphics commands to an offboard
rendering box- they seemed blithely unconcerned about lost data (like
attempting to do VM mapping at interrupt level in OSF/1 and, hey, if
pmap_enter failed, just send whatever you pointed to.....tha's cool,
bro....)
