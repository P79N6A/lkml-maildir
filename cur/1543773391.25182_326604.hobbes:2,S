Gosh, I thought from the Subject that you'd taken over from Linus,
and were announcing your new release ;)

No, the error is "kernel BUG at mm/memory.c:1112!", which occurs while
it's holding page table lock, from which it doesn't recover very well.
It's the BUG_ON(!pte_none(*pte)) in remap_pte_range.  Maybe your page
table is corrupt, maybe your driver is trying to remap_pfn_range on
top of something already mapped.
