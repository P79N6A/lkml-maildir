Subject: [PATCH] New csum and csum_copy routines with boot-time selection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is a kernel patch which replaces compile-time selection
of csum and csum_copy routines with boot-time one.
This allows kernel to use fastest routines _for given CPU_.
Checks CPU capabilities before using 'em.
I tried to generalize code so it will be possible to adapt it
for memcpy, copy to/from user etc.
Theory of operation: I replace functions with pointers in .h files:
-asmlinkage unsigned int csum_partial(const unsigned char * buff, int len, unsigned int sum);
+extern
+asmlinkage unsigned int (*csum_partial)(const unsigned char * buff, int len, unsigned int sum);
Pointers are initialized to default routines:
+csum_func *csum_partial = csum_simple;
+csumcpy_func *csum_partial_copy_generic = csumcpy_simple;
After benchmarking they are replaced by fastest ones:
+	best = find_best(bench_csum, buffer, csum_runner,
+			VECTOR_SZ(csum_runner));
+	printk("csum: using csum function: %s\n", best->name);
+	csum_partial = (csum_func*)(best->f);
bench_func.[ch] contains generic benchmarking support.
To be used for memcpy and copy to/from user... later...
Some thoughts:
+/* Set this to value bigger than cache(s) */
+#define bufshift 20	/* 10=1kb,20=1Mb etc */
+#define chunksz (4*1024)
How to make this picked according to cache amount
(I mean reliably even for future CPUs)?
+	char *buffer = (char *) __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL,
+					(bufshift-PAGE_SHIFT));
hmmm... using __xx func... what is 'official' way to do it?
+#define ROUND(x) \
+SRC(	movq	x(%esi), %mm0	);	\
+	adcl	x(%esi), %eax	;	\
+	adcl	x+4(%esi), %eax	;	\
+DST(	movntq	%mm0, x(%edi)	);
+// we don't need SRC() around 2nd and 3rd commands
+// (exception, if any, would be catched by 1st one)
+// (FIXME: can races against interrupts bite us?)
So, can page disappear under us here or not?
Currently code is very verbose at boot time and runs too much
benchmark repetitions for debugging purposes.
I don't know of any bugs in the code, but they can be there.
No warranties. I gave it a limited testing so far, it didn't eat
my disk and didn't drink my coffee :)
My dmesg snippet shown below. Patch and test suite attached
(bzipped).
