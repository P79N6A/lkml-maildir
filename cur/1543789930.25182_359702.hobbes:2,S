However, the block layer is used in the context of a
block device (and in some cases a char device).
If SAS domain discovery is done from the user space, and
the root file system is the far side of a SAS expander,
there are no suitable devices, just the SAS initiator
(HBA) which currently we cannot address via the block layer.
