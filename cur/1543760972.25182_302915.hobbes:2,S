Andi,
thanks for the response.
The code forks immediately and the new process segfaults immediately. 
From an inspection of 'strace -f' on a working version, the next call
would have been setsid() . (The library call in the code is daemon(0,0)).
The original Makefile has an LDFLAG of -N (OMAGIC: make text secion writable, 
don't page-align the data section.... No idea why).
If I compile with ancient gcc/ld,
it works after compiling without -N and segfaults when compiling with -N.
If I compile with a recent gcc/ld, it works fine.
here's an objump of the segfaulting portmap
------------------------------------------------
>  objdump -x /usr/sbin/portmap
/usr/sbin/portmap:     file format a.out-i386-linux
/usr/sbin/portmap

and here's the objdump of the test without -N
>  objdump -h a.out

                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, CODE
  1 .data         00001000  00003000  00003000  00002000  2**3
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
  2 .bss          00000000  00004000  00004000  00000000  2**3
                  ALLOC
--------------------------------------------------
so maybe the alignment difference is the problem?
as I said before, I have things working, only reporting this on the possibility
that it's a bug worth  investigating.
thanks
