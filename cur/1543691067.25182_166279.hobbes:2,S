What would happen if the kernel received two keypress events, and then one key-
release event for a single key?  I'd imagine that it'd disregard the duplicate
keypress

any idea what might cause the key sticking problem?  I wouldn't think it's
a directly hardware-related problem (though it might be in BIOS firmware, I
suppose) because the problem is resolved when I reboot.
Also, I'm not sure how the final issue I described could have occurred, since
it appears to be keymap-related.  Is there some special keycode that might be
able to cause a change in the keymap?  Also, does the behavior I described
match any common keymaps?  I typically don't set LANG or any of the other
locale-defining variables.
