Subject: [PATCH] linux-2.4.1-pre9/drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c usb_device_id table broken by new format
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/1/20/118

	The format of usb_device_id tables was recently changed
(just before 2.4.0, I think) to include a match_flags field.  A bit
set to one in that field indicates that a given member of the structure
contains a valid value that must match.  A bit set to zero indicates
a wildcard (skip the comparison).  Compiling a driver that uses the old
format results in that driver having a usb_device_id structure that
has an all zeroes match_flags, which means don't compare anything.
That is, it is a completely wildcard and will match every USB interface.
	As of 2.4.1-pre9, there appears to be only USB driver that
was missed: drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c.  This patch fixes the problem.
