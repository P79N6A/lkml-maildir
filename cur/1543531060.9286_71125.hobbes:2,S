Hi,
I'm using alloc_bootmem_pages to reserve a chunk of physical RAM,
for use by a PCI card and a user-level program.  Something appears
to be going wrong though.  Am I right in assuming that memory
allocated through alloc_bootmem_pages remains reserved and
un-swapable ?  My attempts to get this to work are being less
than successful, any help appreciated.
Thanks,
-- Fred
