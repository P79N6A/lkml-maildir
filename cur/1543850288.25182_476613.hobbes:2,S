There is no such config symbol.  NET_ETHERNET means 10/100 ethernet.
Gigabit ethernet doesn't use the ETHERNET symbol (and doesn't use
this flavor of MII IIRC).
And all of this config space is surrounded by:
# All the following symbols are dependent on NETDEVICES - do not repeat
# that for each of the symbols.
if NETDEVICES
so it is actually
config MII
	depends on NETDEVICES
What do you suggest?
