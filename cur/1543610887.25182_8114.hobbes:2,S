Unless Red Hat has specifically added Andrea's new VM code to the 2.4.9
kernel, then that kernel is still using the old VM. The 2.4.10 (?) and above
kernels all use Andrea's new VM, and this includes 2.4.16 (obviously :-). My
guess is that it is a small VM-related problem, but I am certainly not a
programmer; I did see other replies to this problem, but I accidently
deleted them before I could fully read them. :-( My suggestion would
definitely to be to try other kernels; I would personally try 2.4.10,
2.4.12, 2.4.14, and you have already tried 2.4.16. This would at the very
least tell you where the problem was introduced, and hopefully, some of the
brilliant kernel people (not me) could take over from there. Hope that
helps.
