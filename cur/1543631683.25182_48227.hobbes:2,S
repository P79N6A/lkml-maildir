Is this not an issue that could be put to RedHat/Mandrake/SuSE/Turbo/etc to
include the above fstab in their standard install.  If the user is going to have
to upgrade their kernel to get this default, they will understand fstab.  If
they do not understand fstab, they are going to upgrade their kernel by
upgrading their distro anyway.  So why not push for this option in the default
fstab of popular distros?
Joe.
