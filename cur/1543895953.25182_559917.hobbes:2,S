Try using real logic rather than the logic of your religion.

Okay, since you want it in a specific language rather than as a set of bullet 
points (which is what I used the => for)
Company X has requirement for restriction Y
  => License on product Z disallows restriction Y
  => Product Z loses Company X and the exposure use in their product gives
  => License on product Z is bad for the product
Understandable now?

By that definition you are correct.

No argument here. What I was stating is that are legal (and other reasons) why 
a company might have to lock down their software in a process similar 
to "Tivoization".

Only when you define a term as specifically as you have done 
for "Tivoization". I should, perhaps, have used a different term - it would 
then have been patently true. Though, at that point, you would likely have 
argued that it wasn't "tivoization"

Your view of the logic is, in this case, flawed. It's more along the lines of 
what I've detailed above. Now, please, go away. You aren't doing 
your "religion" any good. In fact, you are damaging it - repeatedly.
