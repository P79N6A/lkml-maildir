When I had the problem described in my previous mail I came to the conclussion 
that it was related with cache *BUT* it seemed that the cache was just 
caching wrong data. Disabling the cache would just reduce the problem.
One reason for this is that when the program detected errors in a buffer (i.e. 
0x1234 instead of 0x1111) then they would NOT go away if the program was 
reading from this buffer all the time. This means that the cache always 
returned the same data. The error was 'gone' every time the program was 
suspended for a while or when something else used a lot of memory (i.e. 
another instance of this program).
So, I'm not suggesting that his cache is faulty but that there can be a CPU 
(or even a M/B) problem that corrupts data when they are transfered from 
memory to the processor.
