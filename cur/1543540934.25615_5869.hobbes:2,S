If replugging the cable helps, it has good chances to be not a driver bug.
It may happen to be hardware flow control misbehavior or something like it.
What is your mode (10/100 full/half duplex)?
There are a lot of things which may be done to get more information what
happens.  Change cable.  Try another port on hub.  Try host-to-host
ethernet connection.  Set speedo_debug to 3 in the driver.  Check the card
status by mii-diag from scyld.com.
