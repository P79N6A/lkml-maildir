OK, now I'm in 2.4.3-pre7 plus your patch and serial as a module (it was
 built in kernel previously) and indeed I have my modem detected
 automatically by the PCMCIA startup sequence (I don't need to manually
 do anything).
I lost the IrDA port, though - ttyS2. Now I only see ttyS0 and ttyS4.
Thanks & ciao,
