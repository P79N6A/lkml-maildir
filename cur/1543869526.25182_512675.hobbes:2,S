Hi !
looking at the Changelogs of the last 2.6.17 kernel and the
first 2.6.18 it is obvious that a lot happened in between - are 
there some changelogs related to 2.6.18 development that are not found
at 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.18.#
 + 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/ChangeLog-2.6.18-rc#
For assessment purposes it would be helpfull to know what low level 
changes happened i.e. when and where were __raw_spin_* introduced ? but
I was not able to extract such infos from the ChangeLogs in the above
directories.
thx !
hofrat
