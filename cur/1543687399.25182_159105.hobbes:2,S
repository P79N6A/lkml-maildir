Agree! Just a flag (ARP_ISOLATED, default to 0) in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*? The default behaviour of the current (and future
kernels) stays as it is now, so it doesn't break for anyone, and a lot of
people (including me :) benefit from a much easier setup.
No need to implement a whole hidden scenario either.
