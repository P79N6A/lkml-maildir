For the analogy to be complete:
User has a file browser (say Nautilus)
The file browser sees the userland VFS (say a unified VFS between GNOME
and KDE)
The VFS sees the real file system
This way the userland VFS can be ported to almost any platform.
When toying around on the desktop, an abstraction of what a file
is works fine with me.  When doing serious work (programming,
tar:ing up stuff, etc) I want to be bloody sure that I see the
files in the same way always.  I don't want surprises such as
files suddenly behaving as directories or vice versa.
