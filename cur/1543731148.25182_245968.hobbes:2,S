    Rick's schedstats stuff had some ways to measure latency that seemed to work
    quite nicely. Hard to simulate exactly mozilla, email, etc, but probably
    close enough to be far more use than "ooh, it feels faster".
    He did a whole paper at OLS ... Rick ... pointer?

There are patches available for schedstats, although I haven't pulled
together 2.6.9-rc1 yet.  Shouldn't take me but fifteen minutes, I think.
Rafael, what baseline release are you comparing to?  I should be able
to provide some tools to measure the effect on updatedb directly for
both 2.6.9-rc1 and your baseline (so long as it's 2.6-based)
Rick
