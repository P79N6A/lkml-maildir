Hi Horst.

Agreed.

That's why I don't plan on starting with that...

True, but that doesn't stop me wishing for it.

True.

Don't worry, I'm well aware of that. It doesn't stop me from wishing
for it...

Depends what it's for...but I agree about the problems...

True.

Nope, that's the use of option (7) below, which you said you don't
want. This point is arguing for consistancy between the semantics of
R/O here and elsewhere.

That depends what it's used for. Let me present two different possible
uses for what I called a "transparent mount"...
 1. The scenario you appear to be basing your comments on, which
    is to have a CD-ROM mounted with a hard drive over it, and
    for files on the hard drive to take priority over matching
    files of the same name in the same path on the CD-ROM.
 2. The scenario that caused me to make my original proposal,
    which is a single database too large to fit on a single CD,
    so supplied as a three CD set. It's designed such that one
    wishing to use it copies all three CD's onto one's hard
    drive in the same directory and uses it from there. In my
    case, I don't have sufficient hard drive space to do that.
If you analyse them, you will see that what makes sense for one is
often nonsense for the other, and they have completely different
requirements from the system as a result...

I suggest you think about what you're saying, as this comment is
totally the opposite of what you've said previously.

One can easily know the direction one is going in without actually
knowing where one is going, and providing one knows the direction,
there is no good reason not to start walking - unless one intends to
fail before one starts, that is. I would hope you're not that sort of
person.

If we were talking strictly about a R/W filesystem, then I'd agree
with you, but that isn't even necessary for the use I would have for
it, so arguments along those lines are meaningless.

Only for the R/W version. It's meaningless for what I personally would
use it for, as the only common entries ARE directories.

Which shows the difference between us:
 1. Following my logic, we would have a filesystem capable of
    transparently mounting multiple CD's (or CD images) on top
    of each other. I could make good use of this, and I'm sure
    there are others who could use it as well.
 2. Following your logic, we would have nothing.
I know which makes more sense to me.

There are probably other options that neither of us have thought of,
including some that we wouldn't even think of until we have something
to play with to see what happens.
Best wishes from Riley.
