Sorry, I think you misunderstood.  I've certainly seen my share of
crazy devices doing things like endian-reversing the MSI address and
sending interrupt messages off into random space.  The only thing I
was disagreeing with was that Jeff suggested it was a driver bug not
to do pci_intx(0) when enabling MSI.
I don't doubt that there are broken devices out there that do generate
wire interrupts even when MSI is enabled.  I just don't think we
should go around "fixing" working, correct drivers for devices that
_do_ follow the spec.
