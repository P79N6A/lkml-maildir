NTP handles most of this, but it needs the cooperation of the O/S kernel
and most of the Unix kernels are able to provide the required API's.
FreeBSD doesn't have any of these problems but Linux historically has.
Most of that code was designed by Dave Mills but since each kernel is
different we should not expect them all to behave the same way and
generally requires an understanding of what NTP expects and that's not
always clear to kernel developers who are not expected to know NTP.
