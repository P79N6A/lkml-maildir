No it's not, for the simple reason that south bridges are almost always
SMBus controllers, not I2C controllers.
That being said, I'd be surprised if it ever matters. I never saw such
transactions, and if some chip was to accept them, it would most
probably also accept a sequence of more simple, SMBus-compatible
transactions to achieve the same goal.
If you have further questions, they are welcome but I'd suggest that you
drop LKML from the recipients and follow up on the lm_sensors list only,
as we are getting somewhat off-topic now.
