That would be an oops (actually a couple).  See 
Documentation/oops-tracing.txt for details on how to run it through 
ksymoops.  Also see REPORTING-BUGS for additional necessary information 
(start with kernel and gcc versions).
Offhand, I'd say the kernel freaked out under extreme memory pressure.  If 
you're using a 2.4.x below .8, try upgrading the kernel first; the early 
ones had some fun VM issues.
