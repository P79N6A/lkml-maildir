Hi,
Just my 2 cents on IBM behaviour,
As a lot people say, we use GNU/linux, means,
GNU -> Stallman 
	-> wish to share computer software with
	   others 
Linux -> Linus 
	-> As Stallman
	-> wants linux to benefit from the best
	   software on the market, even if it is
	   commercial.
IBM wants to be able to make changes on kernel and
other software in order to please their customer.
But my question is :
Do they already have made changes on a driver in their
computers made by an other company ?
I feel they never did that, they just asked the company
which made the driver to provide a fix release.
So i just think it should be the same for linux.They
should ask whoever made the driver, or someone who wants
to make a free patch for them... otherwise they just
make their own and provide them freely.
I just think IBM just need to make up their mind,
linux is not just an other OS they will own...

NB : linux is not just an other OS, it is more
     a momument a la stakanovitch.
