Hmh, there was some discussion concluding that ioctl is
"bad taste from hell". Syscalls are considered cleaner
and less error prone.

I just reused the message storage code.

Yes, I'm also sorry ;-) 
a wget 
http://homepage.mac.com/pwaechtler/linux/mqueue.tgz
should work. (i'm not comfortable with my own homepage, shame on me :)

Yes, indeed. I also evaluated your implementation and the one from Jakub.
First I thought: hey cool, they use binary trees for the messages - but
no: you use trees to keep track which process uses which queue.
Your code carries a lot of baggage.. the VFS can do all this for you/me

Yes, why not. But to be honest my implementation is already "full featured".
Perhaps one could handle the message lists more effectively .. 
I'm currently trying to do some performance measurements with NPTL and the
userspace implementation I have.
