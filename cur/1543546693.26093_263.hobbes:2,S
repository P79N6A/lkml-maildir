(Fwiw I know exactly how Linux scheduling works.  If I'm unclear it's bad
explanation on my part).

Conclusion: each CPU needs a stack to handle interrupts.  Quelle suprise.

You only save register state in the task_struct in certain profitable
cases.  In those cases, the _only_ thing to copy are the registers.  No
unwind or recursive fault nonsense.  7 words on x86.  Restoring doesn't
require the full copy.
I bet that's more than made up for by the cache benefits of reusing the
stack page.

There are a couple of really obvious states where you don't need to
record the full path to where we slept.
   - The schedule() in ret_from_sys_call.
   - do_poll().
The first is used when pre-empting, such as when we have lots of threads
running.  The second is used by almost every task that sleeps, including
heavy duty servers.
What you do need to save then is the stack state in do_poll.  Well,
there's very little of that indeed.  Not even a full register set.

Quite.  But the stack frame in that case is _exactly_ the same each time
and only a few words, basically the registers.

Fundamentally they don't have to be.

It's fast because it does very little.  Any stack page optimisation has
to keep the current scheme for system calls.  That means switching
stacks only when making a task idle, and quite possibly only under
memory pressure.
There's a thought.  A memory pressure hook that frees hardly-used stack
pages.

Think of the cache benefits of sharing :-)
Think of kernel stacks as a resource worth keeping a limited pool of,
per CPU.  Like the pgd cache.  You don't have to save state on _every_
pre-emptive task switch, just the old ones.

Well well.  I think it's possible to over the best of user-space "fake"
threads plus the advantages of "true" kernel threads in one blindingly
fast combination, in less than 8kB per thread.
If you stop and think for a moment, I think you'll see it too.
