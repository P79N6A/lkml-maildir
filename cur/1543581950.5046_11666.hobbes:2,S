I've had cases (on VIA chipsets) where, even or ATA33, a 40-pin cable
caused CRC errors for ATA33 and an 80-pin cable fixed things. (The same
40-pin cable does ATA33 without problems on an AMD 750 or an Intel BX,
though.)
IIRC, Andre Hedrick has said in the past that a marginal PSU or
motherboard can also cause CRC errors.
