we do have SLAB [which essentially caches structures, on a per-CPU basis]
which i did take into account, but still, initializing a 600+ byte kiovec
is probably more work than the rest of sending a packet! I mean i'd love
to eliminate the 200+ bytes skb initialization as well, it shows up.

The fact that we're using single-page interfaces doesnt preclude us from
having nicely clustered requests, this is what IO-plugging is about!

which cases?

yes, because depending on the application to send properly sized requests
is a futile act IMO. So we do have intelligent buffering and clustering in
basically every kernel subsystem - and we'll continue to have it because
we have no choice - most of Linux's user-visible IO APIs have byte
granularity (which is good btw.). Adding a multi-page interface will IMO
mostly just complicate the design and the implementation. Do you have
empirical (or theoretical) proof which shows that single-page interfaces
cannot perform well?

nothing prevents the introduction of specialized interfaces - if they feel
like they can get enough traction. I was talking about the normal Linux IO
APIs, read()/write()/sendfile(), which are byte granularity and invoke an
almost mandatory buffering/clustering mechanizm in every kernel subsystem
they deal with.
