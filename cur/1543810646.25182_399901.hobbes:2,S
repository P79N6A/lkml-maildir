It was important because it used to fix both the printk and
(completely accidentally!) the boot problem itself.

I don't even think #ifdef is needed. Having that for the UP
case may be useless, yet looks consistent to me.

This is enough for printk but not for the boot lockup.
The attached patch is however enough. And it should be
correct, as it is consistent with an UP case.

Looking into the arch-specific code, I can see that some
arches evaluate the boot-cpu number by some other means,
not by the smp_processor_id(). Still I am pretty sure the
patch won't hurt them.
With this patch and with the hotfixes, I've got the -mm
kernel working, thanks.

Register the boot-cpu in the cpu maps earlier to allow the
early printk to work, and to fix an obscure deadlock at boot.
