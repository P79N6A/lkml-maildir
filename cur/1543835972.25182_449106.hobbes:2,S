I will add some info to Documentation/sched-domains.txt aswell as some
comments to the code where appropriate. I did some cleanup of the code
but unfortunately that got dropped because of some issues. I will repost
that cleanup patch aswell.

I have to agree with you. I have an idea(basically passing cpu_map info
to functions which determine the group) to solve this issue. Let me work
on it and post a fix.

Enabling SCHED_DOMAIN_DEBUG should atleast show how sched domains
and groups are arranged. Adding an example in Documentation might
be a good idea.

Will keep you in loop.
