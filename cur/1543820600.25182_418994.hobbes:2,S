I haven't been directly involved in this work, but I am very confident
in Dean's work in this.
Just a few minor nits below:

Any patch that adds vmalloc() calls to code always makes the little
hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Any chance we could get away with
alloc_pages_node() for this?

This thing could in theory fail so having the error check there seems
the right thing to me. In either case, please don't (void) the function
return (this is a style issue, I know).

This part we should maybe do in a seperate patch? It seems valid on it's
own?
