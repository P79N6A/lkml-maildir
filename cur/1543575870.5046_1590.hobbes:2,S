Subject: Linux 2.4.0-test11/12 freezes when copying large amounts of data to loop file system

Hi,
Every time I try to copy a specific directory to a mounted loop file system, 
Linux freezes up on me. I've tried this several times and it freezes up at 
the same place every time. When I copy that same directory to a regular file 
system everything is ok.
This happens on 2.4.0 test11 and test12 kernels. I've tried a test8 kernel 
previously and it didn't have this problem. Is this a known issue and if so, 
is there a patch available somewhere?
PS: as im not on this list please CC a reply to me.
Thanks,
