(FWIW for Andrew)
I'm going to apply Andrew's patch, but without the PCI id removals.
Then, I'll apply a patch that adds Kconfig questions
	Include hardware that conflicts with libata SATA driver?
	(in drivers/ide)
and
	Include hardware that conflicts with IDE driver?
	(in libata, drivers/scsi)
and apply the associated ifdefs to the low-level drivers.
This is necessary to both enable conflict prevention, and also make sure
we don't break existing setups in the move to libata for SATA stuff.
