I can confirm that a plain 21-rc3 still suffers from this problem.  This 
run of amanda terminated after 13 of the 32 dle's after writing just 
short of 12GB to the vtape. 8 were level 0's, 5 were level 1's, all were 
gzipped, achieving a compression ratio of 40% of original size.  There is 
about 45GB of data here to backup, on a 5 day dumpcycle.
If, and I have previously, I revert to a 2.6.20-ck1 patching, this does 
not occur.  So my contention is that someplace in this recent progression 
from 2.6.20 to 2.6.21-rc3, there is a patch which acts to change how 
c-time is being reported to tar.  Or there is a spillage into c-times 
when tar does its estimate scans where the output goes to /dev/null.
Or possibly even this version of tar is doing it differently.  I just 
looked up how to get the c-times out of ls, and they, as far as ls is 
concerned, look sane.  But tars actions while running a 2.6.21-rcX kernel 
certainly are not.  I do have a plain -rc2 I can try, so that will be the 
next test.  If that also fails in this manner, I'll build a later 
2.6.20-2 or whatever to verify that it doesn't so suffer.
I love your patches Con, but I'll leave them out of this next testing.  No 
use pointing fingers at good code.
