Unfortunately, no.  Matching multiple * characters inherently requires
backtracking, and backtracking requires a stack.
I could make it a finite-depth explicit stack rather than using
the C stack implicitly, but it doesn't save much on reasonable
patterns.
But if you want it for user input, I can work at making it more
robust.  What are your sped needs?
0 - Runs once only, speed unimportant
1 - Runs several thousand times (counting all NxM matches), would like
    it to not be too slow.
2 - Run a thousand times per second, but it's a debug feature so
    a speed hit is acceptable.
3 - Common code path, maybe rearchitect to save time.
4 - Kernel fast path, every cycle counts!
There are quite a few things (with commensurate code size increases)
that can't help the big-O worst-case performance, but improve the average
case considerably.
One thing I don't do that's quite possible is to find the fixed-length
head and tail of the pattern (the parts before the first * and after the
last) and match those before dealing with the annoying middle.
That would avoid all backtracking in cases with a single *, and make a
good pre-filter before doing anything expensive in the middle.
H'm... I think there's an equivalent and more general version based on
the number of characters a pattern matches.  Any pattern's length is
N characters, plus a flag indicating if that's fixed or just a minimum.
When matching a *, compute the length of the following pattern and only
try matching cases which have the right length.
If we need to do a lot of matching against a single pattern, it's possible
to preprocess it to find the fixed-length spans and their lengths.
(The current blacklist application is exactly the opposite: matching
one string against a list of patterns.)
