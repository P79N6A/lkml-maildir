First, one consideration I forgot:
Would it be beneficial to encapsulate the timer_list structure? That way
if the units change underneath and we eventually move to timer_fsecs
(for femtoseconds), we don't need to change all the callers of
set_timer_nsecs() again?
I'm envisioning something along the lines of:
init_and_set_timer_nsecs((void *)(function), unsigned long data, nsec_t
				expires_nsecs);
I guess the trick then, is that a pointer to the created timer_list in
init_and_set_timer_nsecs() needs to be handed back to the caller, to
guarantee they can delete the timer if needed. Maybe that won't work :/
Just a thought, which might make this the hard transition, but should
make extensibility easier to handle.

Also, some updates:

There was a bug in my ppc64 emulation (was just using jiffies not
(jiffies - INITIAL_JIFFIES)), here's is the update value for tod-timer:

Also, here are the differentials between 2.6.12-rc6 and
2.6.12-rc6-tod-timer with emulation of do_monotonic_clock() on NUMA-Q.
numaq, 16-way 700 MHz, PIII, 16GB RAM
			Elapsed	User	System	CPU
2.6.12-rc6		100%	100%	100%	100%
2.6.12-rc6-tod-timer	100.99%	98.1%	99.13%	98.02%
Thanks,
