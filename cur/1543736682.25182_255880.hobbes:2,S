Thanks Ray. From looking over your old results, it appears that -kswapdfix
probably has the nicest swappiness ramp, which is probably to be expected,
as the problem that is being fixed did exist in all other kernels you 
tested,
but the later ones just had other aggrivating changes.
The swappiness=60 weirdness might just be some obscure interaction with the
workload. If that is the case, it is probably not too important, however it
could be due to a possible oversight in my patch....
I'm not in front of the code right now, so I can't give you a new patch to
try yet... if you're up for modifying it yourself though: we possibly should
be updating "zone->prev_priority" after each 32 (SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX) pages 
freed.
So change the following:
==>    if (total_reclaimed >= 32)
==>       break;
    }
out:
    for (i = 0; i < pgdat->nr_zones; i++) {
       ... /* this updates zone->prev_priority */
    }
=>  if (!all_zones_ok)
=>     goto loop_again;
    return total_reclaimed;
}
so it looks something like that.
If you could run your tests again on that, it would be great.
Thanks
Nick
