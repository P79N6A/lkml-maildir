Because a kernel that cannot be used with old filesystems is a _useless_ 
kernel as far as I'm concerned.
Backwards compatibility is _important_. It's HUGELY important. It's just
possibly more important than anything else the kernel ever can do.
And new kernels need to be able to seamlessly boot into a disk-image that 
may still need to be used from an old kernel. Without any magic going on.
We can discontinue the old IDE/SCSI majors one or two stable releases 
_after_ we've switched over to a global "disk major". In other words, 
that's about five years down the line after you shouldnä't have to care 
any more.
