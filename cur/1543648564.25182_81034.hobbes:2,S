	In linux-2.5.42 and .43, I get this recurring error message:
fix old protocol handler pppoe_rcv+0x0/0x124 [pppoe]
	which is apparently from deliver_to_old_ones() in net/core/dev.c:
#if CONFIG_SMP
        /* Old protocols did not depened on BHs different of NET_BH and
           TIMER_BH - they need to be fixed for the new assumptions.
         */
        print_symbol("fix old protocol handler %s!\n", (unsigned long)pt->func)\
;
#endif
	I'm puzzling out exactly change this message is requesting,
and I thought it might be a better use of everyone's time if I first
ask if there is a porting guide or other document about converting an
"old" style protocol handler to a "new" one.
