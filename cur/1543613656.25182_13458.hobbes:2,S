Well "multiple streams file format" is purely a FILESYSTEM issue.  When it
is outside of the filesystem, it is an ARCHIVE (e.g. tar, cpio, zip, SHA, etc).
So this whole concept is bogus.

Well, the good news is that this whole discussion is moot.  Al Viro has
already written a kernel patch which does all of this, and I'm sure he
is just waiting to get it into the 2.5 kernel.  It creates an "initramfs"
which is populated from a cpio (or tar, can't remeber) archive attached
to the kernel image.
This does things like BOOTP/DHCP discovery, mount the rootfs, load
modules, etc, all before the root filesystem is mounted.  This allows
removing all sorts of junk from the kernel which was there because it
needed to be done before the root filesystem was mounted.
Cheers, Andreas
