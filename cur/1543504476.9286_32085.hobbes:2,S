Then I've been talking too much to PC-centric people, who kept on telling me I
should be using readb() and friends to access _all_ memory mapped I/O.
I don't dare to accuse DaveM of being PC-centric (:-), but he told me my
readb() should find out itself whether it's used on an address belonging to the
PCI or the SBUS or the whatever bus... Except for cases that can be optimized
away.

Agreed. PCI was never intended to be PC-only. I'm aware of that fact.

Initialization indeed differs. Other things may be the same.
In my domain, I'm mainly concerned about the fbcon-* low level drivers. They
just paint characters in memory, which is the same for all cards. Wait a bit...
Memory? This is not always normal memory, it may be mapped through ioremap().
That's why we changed the `pointer dereference style accesses' to `readb() and
friends'.
In 2.3.x, I plan to use `fb_{read,write}*()', which can be re#define'd to
whatever you want if your bus/driver needs it.
I'm just afraid we'll end up with a zillion versions of these fbcon-* low level
drivers now...

In that case I vote for moving the ioport_resource and iomem_resource
definition from kernel/resource.c to a machine/architecture/bus specific file.
Then it makes sense we create zorro_resource and sbus_resource for the Zorro
resp. SBUS bus on Amiga resp. SPARC systems.
Besides, the resource struct contains the start and end addresses of the
resource region, which depend on the machine type. Assuming `PCI mem' is from
0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF is a PCism. E.g. on my CHRP PPC box `PCI mem' is from
0xC0000000-0xF6FFFFFF. And it is `PC style' PCI...
Or do we have to overwrite iomem_resource.{start,end} in setup_arch() with the
correct machine-specific values?
