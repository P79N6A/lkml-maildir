Hi all,
here comes the fifth hotfix for 2.4.31. It basically is a merge of things
which have popped up since 2.4.32-pre3. Nothing really scary, this one is
more opportunist than absolutely needed. Andrea's fix is worth the upgrade
for people running x86 with more than 4 GB RAM though.
As usual, 3 kernels have been released : 2.4.31-hf5, 2.4.30-hf8, 2.4.29-hf15.
Starting with next release, there will only be one tgz for all kernels,
because duplicating lots of common parts is rather boring (and will be even
more when 2.4.32 will be included). But the patches will still be released
individually of course.
The files have been uploaded here :

Only 2.4.31-hf5 has been compiled. Please let Grant Coady the time to build
and test them all before rushing to his report site :
