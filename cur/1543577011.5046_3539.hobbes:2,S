when i make bzimage with the pc/xx driver configured as a module, it
compiles ok.  configuring it as built-in gives the following error:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.0-prerelease/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i586    -c -o pcxx.o pcxx.c
pcxx.c: In function `pcxxdelay':
pcxx.c:1826: `mseconds' undeclared (first use in this function)
pcxx.c:1826: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
pcxx.c:1826: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [pcxx.o] Error 1
