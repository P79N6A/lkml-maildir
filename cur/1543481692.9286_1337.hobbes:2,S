    An interesting question to consider is whether we think it's a good idea
    to start adopting the proposed IEEE notation for binary multiples, i.e
    name    Name    Symbol
    2**10    kibi    Ki
    2**20    mebi    Mi
    2**30    gibi    Gi
    2**40    tebi    Ti
    So 1024 bytes == 1 KiB, 1024*1024 bytes == 1 MiB, etc....  and 1 MB is
    exactly 1,000,000 bytes, 1GB is exactly 1,000,000,000 bytes, and so on.
    This has the advantage of being precise, and removing the ambiguity of
    exactly what did people mean by "8.4GB"?  The disadvantage is that it's
    not clear to me how successful this new proposed nomenclature will work
    out.  The proponents mean well, and the scheme is logical and
    well-thought out.  On the other hand, ...
My point of view would be that the main goal of the proposal is to
offer an alternative. 1 GB = 10^9 B, but what if you really mean 2^30 B?
Now there is a notation for that, too: 1 GiB.
Maybe nobody expects these new symbols to be used a lot -
they just serve to keep the old symbols clean.
    One potential solution would be print the message both ways.  I.e.,
    print out that the disk sizes both in "megabytes" and "mebibytes".
Yes. I dislike the names, but the symbols are good enough,
so in the new version of the Large Disk HOWTO one can read
"This allows access of up to 8.4 GB (7.8 GiB)."
    So instead of saying just this:
    hda: IBM-DTCA-24090, 3909MB w/468kB Cache, CHS=993/128/63
    we'd print out something like this:
    hda: IBM-DTCA-24090, 3909MB (3727 MiB) w/468KiB Cache, CHS=993/128/63
Yes. Probably
    hda: IBM-DTCA-24090, 4100MB (3910 MiB) w/468KiB Cache, CHS=993/128/63
    It's more verbose, true, but when you consider the millions and millions
    of innocent electrons slaughtered every few months as this thread
    repeatedly comes vampire-like back from the dead, it might just be worth
    it.  :-)
Exactly.
