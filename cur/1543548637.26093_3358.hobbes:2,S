Hi,
Do not know if this is the right place to be asking this, but I thought it
is worth a try to start with.  Does anyone know if the High-Point HT370
UDMA100 controller is supported under the current 2.2.x Linux Kernel?
Basically just bought an UDMA100 IBM hd, with an ABit BE6-II-100 m/board and
wondering if the upcoming RedHat 7.0 will install on it, or will I have to
put the HD on the IDE bus instead?
Regards,
Chris Mason
