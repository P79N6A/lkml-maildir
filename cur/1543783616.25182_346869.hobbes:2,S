I assume you are worried about the stuff under asm that ends up
being included by nearly every header file in the world.  Of
course asm must use double-underscore types.  But the thing is,
the vast majority of the kernel headers live under
linux/include/linux/ and do not use double-underscore types, they
use kernel specific, non-underscored types such as s8, u32, etc.
My copy of IEEE 1003.1 and my copy of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 both fail
to prohibit using the shiny new ISO C99 type for the various
#include <linux/*> header files, which is what I was suggesting.
The world would be so much nicer a place if user space were free
to #include linux/* header files rather than keeping a
per-project private copy of all kernel structs of interest.  And
where these kernel headers would #include stdint.h and define
their stucts in terms of ISO C99 types.  I see nothing at all in
the standards preventing such a change,
 -Erik
