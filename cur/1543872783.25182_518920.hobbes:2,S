Subject: [PATCH 2/2] mm: incorrect direct io error handling (v6)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/12/31

I realy don't want to be annoying by sending this patcheset over and over
again, i just want the issue to be solved. If anyone think this solution
is realy cappy, please comment what exectly is bad. Thank you.
Changes:
  - patch was split in two patches.
  - comments added. I think now it is clearly describe things.
  - patch prepared against 2.6.20-mm3
How this patch tested:
  - fsstress test.
  - manual direct_io tests.
LOG:
 - Trim off blocks after generic_file_direct_write() has failed.
 - Update out of date comments about direct_io locking rules.
