This really would need so coordination with user space using 
them. Otherwise it'll be quite unreliable because any user program
can break it.
Long ago (in 2.4 time frame) there used to be a IBM patch floating
around to reserve them globally and user space to use specific ones. I
guess something like that would be needed again.
