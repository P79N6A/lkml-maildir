Hmm, are there any fs (read+write) alternatives for pendrives?
jffs2 only works on mtd devices, and that excludes pendrives, which are 
block devices. I know LogFS will work with block devices one day, but 
currently, it doesn't (and is not in the kernel yet as well).
Also, ext2 provides a nice feature other filesystems lack: xip. 
Especially, if a pendrive is used as a rootfs for a small device.
