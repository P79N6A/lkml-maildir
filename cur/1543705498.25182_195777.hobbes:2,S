Is it actually a requirement for drives to support anything other than
a full erase properly?  Is the 'fast' erase valid per spec, or does it
just happen to work on 99% of devices?  Is this problem reproducable
if a full erase is done instead of a fast erase?
I've added the original poster to the CC list.
