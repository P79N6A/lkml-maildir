Whomever broke up arch/i386/kernel/setup.c and created the CPU
directory (very good idea) messed up in at least one place:
The *AMD-defined* CPUID flags (0x80000001) are not just used on AMD
processors!  In fact, at least AMD, Transmeta, Cyrix and VIA all use
them; I don't know about Centaur or Rise.  Intel supports the actual
level starting with the P4 although it returns all zero.
It should, in my opinion, be moved into generic_identify().  Anyone
who has a reason why that shouldn't be done speak now or I'll send the
patch to Linus.
