Wait a minute. Before poking holes at other code paths, can you please
answer the question I'm asking? I repeat: for the devfs revalidate
code, do you see any remaining problems if I increment the module
usage count?
If you want to point out other problem paths, that's fine. But please
answer specific questions so that progress can be made.

When you say "entry is removed", are you actually referring to a devfs
entry being removed? Or are you talking more generally about the
module being removed?
For the case where devfs_open() is running, the devfs entry remains
valid over the lifetime of the open(). In fact, it remains valid over
the lifetime of the dentry.

And since then the refcounting code has gone in, and many of your old
concerns have been addressed. I'm trying to engage you in a productive
dialogue to resolve any remaining issues.
