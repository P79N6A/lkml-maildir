Thank you for your ideas.  But lets be clear here, they are _your_ ideas
and have as little to do with fact as your legal problems with Novell have 
to do with Linux.
Quoting from the Utah State Consitution:
    
http://www.le.state.ut.us/~code/const/htm/co_17003.htm
    "An Act to punish polygamy and other kindred offenses," approved February
    4th, A.D. 1892, in so far as the same defines and imposes penalties for
    polygamy, is hereby declared to be in force in the State of Utah. 
There was even a very recent case where a polygamist was charged and convicted.
I suggest you take a look:
