Okay, here is my latest attempt to find a way to toggle A20M# that
genuinely works on all machines -- including Olivettis, IBM Aptivas,
bizarre notebooks, yadda yadda.
The bizarre notebooks with broken SMM code are the ones I really worry
most about... there may very well be NO WAY to support them that actually
works on all machines, because you don't get any kind of feedback that
they are broken.
If you have had A20M# problems with any kernel -- recent or not --
*please* try this patch, against 2.4.0-test12-pre5:
