Hi Patrick, how are you?
Yes, this is what I meant, sorry for not being clear.

Yes, I have.

The eh_timed_out + eh_strategy_handler is actually pretty perfect,
and _complete_, for any application and purpose in recovering a
LU/device/host (in that order ;-) ).

Consider this: When SCSI Core told you that the command timed out,
	A) it has already finished,
	B) it hasn't already finished.
In case A, you can return EH_HANDLED.  In case B, you return
EH_NOT_HANDLED, and deal with it in the eh_strategy_handler.
(Hint: you can still "finish" it from there.)
EH_RESET_TIMER is not really needed provided that
	- your interface infrastructure is in place,
	- you set the timeout value properly in slave_configure.

See above.
