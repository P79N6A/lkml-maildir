Subject: More on the VIA KT133 chipset misbehaving in Linux
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The VIA KT133 chipset exhibits the following bugs under Linux 2.2.17 and
2.4.0:
1) PS/2 mouse cursor randomly jumps to upper right hand corner of screen and
locks for a bit
2) Detects a maximum of 64mb of ram, unless worked around by the "mem="
switch
3) The clock drifts slowly (more so under heavy load than light load),
leaking time.
I think #2 is because e820h memory detection is not properly implemented on
the KT133 chipset, or because of some silly BIOS bug that VIA has not
addressed.  I have no idea yet why #1 and #3 happen.  If any gurus out there
have any pointers on where I can look, and what I should prod, I know my way
around with a compiler and editor ;)
