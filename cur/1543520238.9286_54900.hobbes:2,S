I donnot use aic7xxx boards but I use to read some scsi lists since years
and I didn't notice the crap you are talking about. Some early pushed out
of the door controllers may have had serious flaws, but this seems to
apply to everything that deals with computers nowadays, including
software. 
By the way, I agree about maintaining drivers for PCI-SCSI controllers
being some Herculean task and that being a strong man not seeming to be
enough.;-)
