I'm getting even one more error:

...
drivers/media/video/tuner.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `debug'
drivers/media/video/msp3400.o:(.bss+0xc): first defined here

There's sometime a need for variables being global being visible in 
all objects of a module.
That's OK.
But they should never have generic names like "debug" or "once" (the 
latter and some similar ones don't seem to cause compile errors since 
they are currently used only once, but they are equally wrong.
