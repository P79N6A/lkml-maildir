Maintaining the current ioctls isn't a problem.  There aren't very many
and they do very discrete things.  The big part that may change is the
device scanning, which may get more integrated into udev and mount (see
other threads about this).
But, that is one very simple ioctl, and most of the code it uses is
going to stay regardless of how the device scanning is done.
