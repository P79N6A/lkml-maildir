I haven't, but I don't think it would be too hard.  I didn't really see the
point, since there's so many other vectors through which you can see outside
the chroot domain - signals, for example, can tell you about what other
processes exist, and who owns them (to some extent).
I thought it was sufficient to merely make proc respect the chroot domain and
leave it at that.
