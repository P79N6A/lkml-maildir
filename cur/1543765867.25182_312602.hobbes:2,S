Greetings,
For months I have been reading as much as I can about the current 
stable/unstable development model, but still have a question.
Has the Linux Kernel reached a point where the majority of developers feel 
that (at least for now) no *MAJOR* "rip it out, stomp on it, burn it and 
start over" parts of the kernel exist any longer? In other words, do you 
feel that we're in a good place at this point and that incremental 
improvements will rule the day until $COOL_IDEA comes along and requires a 
refactoring of 2.x (where x is an odd number) porportions?
Thank you,
..Chuck..
