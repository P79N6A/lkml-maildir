Yupp, that's exactly what I meant.

And JFS and reiserfs.  Yes, this code should be in a library, but e.g.
XFS (different ondisk format) or NFSv4/NTFS/whatever need very different
ACL rountines.  You can't easily plug the handler into different filesystems
due to very different implementations below the VFS level.
BTW, do you have a pointer to your DSM system?  I'l like to look at something
less broken them dmapi..
