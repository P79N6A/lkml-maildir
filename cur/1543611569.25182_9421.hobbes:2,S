ABSOLUTELY AGREE!!!!! (Is that too many exclamation marks?)
But try telling people that shipping files then overwriting them is a
bad idea.

The moment you use cp -al on a kernel source tree, you are running the
risk of time stamp problems.
  cp -al pristine tree1
  cp -al pristine tree2
  cd tree1
  make *config bzImage
  cd tree2
  make *config bzImage
The make in tree1 and tree2 touches the time stamps on included files.
Because most include files are hard linked, it changes the time stamps
on all three trees, including the pristine source.  Even if you never
compile in tree1 and tree2 at the same time, when you switch back and
forth between trees you will get semi-random time stamp changes.
Normally the unwanted time stamp updates only forces spurious
recompiles, but I believe that there are some sequences that create an
incomplete kernel build.
