I don't think virt_to_bus is the correct function to be using for this 
translation (or pretty much anything, these days). What is this memory 
that you are attempting to do an mmap on, and where is this code going? 
Unless this is an ISA device and you need physical memory for DMA, 
__get_dma_pages is not correct either.

The kernel isn't responsible for checking that the memory ranges you 
attempt to remap are what you intended - if you get this wrong, things 
can blow up, that's just the way it is.
I would suggest following some similar driver/code in the kernel as an 
example if possible..
