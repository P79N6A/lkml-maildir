Hi!
I get nasty warning for each file compiled:
  CC      drivers/video/sa1100fb.o
In file included from include/asm/bitops.h:23,
                 from include/linux/bitops.h:9,
                 from include/linux/thread_info.h:20,
                 from include/linux/preempt.h:9,
                 from include/linux/spinlock.h:49,
                 from include/linux/module.h:9,
                 from drivers/video/sa1100fb.c:163:
include/asm/system.h: In function `adjust_cr':
include/asm/system.h:185: warning: implicit declaration of function
`local_irq_save'
include/asm/system.h:192: warning: implicit declaration of function
`local_irq_restore'
include/asm/system.h:179: warning: unused variable `cr'
Plus compile error. It should be some search&replace I should do, but
which one?
drivers/video/sa1100fb.c:1447:49: macro "INIT_WORK" passed 3
arguments, but takes just 2
drivers/video/sa1100fb.c: In function `sa1100fb_init_fbinfo':
drivers/video/sa1100fb.c:1447: error: `INIT_WORK' undeclared (first
use in this function)
drivers/video/sa1100fb.c:1447: error: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
drivers/video/sa1100fb.c:1447: error: for each function it appears
in.)
drivers/video/sa1100fb.c: At top level:
drivers/video/sa1100fb.c:1204: warning: `sa1100fb_task' defined but
not used
make[2]: *** [drivers/video/sa1100fb.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/video] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
        INIT_WORK(&fbi->task, sa1100fb_task, fbi);
...
/*
 * Our LCD controller task (which is called when we blank or unblank)
 * via keventd.
 */
static void sa1100fb_task(void *dummy)
{
        struct sa1100fb_info *fbi = dummy;
        u_int state = xchg(&fbi->task_state, -1);
        set_ctrlr_state(fbi, state);
}
(Or will I need to play with container_of or something? I guess I did
not pay attetion to workqueue stuff).
