   Well, this could have something to do with the fact
   that our page fault handler only maps in _1_ page at
   a time, so we're trapping into the pagefault handler
   every 4kB...
The Apache folks were keeping it mapped across requests,
so even if it was "primed" (ie. pre-faulted), a read() into
a static buffer was still significantly faster.
