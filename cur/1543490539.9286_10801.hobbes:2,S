Don't sweat it! There was a lot going on, and New Orleans is such a cool
place that sensory overload can take one's mind out rather quickly.
I think that this talk was the one where some arrogant twerp from EMC got
up and said "We've been doing things much more sophisticated than this for
years". Not a really very pertinent or illuminating comment.
At any rate, my notes are pretty incomplete on this talk- it *was* a quick
work-in-progress talk (< 7 minutes presentation+questions), and I can't
find the online version of the abstract, so maybe the author (I *believe*
that is 'drew@cs.berkeley.edu'- that's what my printed abstract says- but 
it might have been Jeanna Neefe (neefe@cs.berkeley.edu)- I was quite
spaced out by that point) could comment or make a more complete version of
the paper available for perusal?
