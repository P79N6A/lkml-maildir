Subject: inotify_rm_watch() EINVAL race condition for deleted files

1. Add IN_DELETE_SELF watch to a file
2. unlink() the file
3. Try to remove the watch -> EINVAL
I undestand this happens because there's an IN_IGNORED event in the
inotify queue, but couldn't inotify_rm_watch() be silent about it if the
event hasn't been read()? Otherwise there's a race condition between the
read() and inotify_rm_watch(), so I'll just always have to ignore EINVAL
errors. I don't like ignoring errors.
