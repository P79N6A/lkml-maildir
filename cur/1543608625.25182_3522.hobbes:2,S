2.4.13+preempt exhibits the same bug (even without latency measurement
patch). 2.4.13 plain is ok.
My subject line is not correct: it has nothing to do with smbfs since
bug shows up when win box creates files on linux share.
nmbd/smbd are started by inetd on my box, and I usually see creation bug
at first attempt to copy file, susequent copies are usually ok.
I have no idea of where I can start planting preempt_disable() and
preempt_enable() in the 2.4.13 to narrow bug location.
Any suggestions? Samba gurus may be more knowledgeable...
