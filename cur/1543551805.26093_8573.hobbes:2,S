(If there's a better place to post this let me know.)
I'd like some help in modifying linux networking code (IP, firewall,
routing).  There are several related projects.  They have to start
out proprietary, but I fully expect the resulting code to become 
free software before long.  
Reply to me, of course.  Thanks.
