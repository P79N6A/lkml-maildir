Subject: 2.2.x: HZ > 100 on Intel x86? (any conclusions)

I know that there were significant discussions on different HZ values
and their impact on a Intel x86 kernel ~1 month ago, but to be honest,
I haven't been able to get any definitive guidance from those
discussions...
  * do the 2.2.x kernels handle the jiffy wrap-around?
  * what was the outcome of all the discussions for /proc values?
At this point I'm inclined to use Artur Skawina's simple patches
from the "[PATCH] HZ==100 assumptions" thread.
Thanks,
	Barrie
