Can you explain why "filesystem foo uses device bar" gives an object associated
with bar and "process baz has bar opened" doesn't?
"Associated with" is asymmetric in this case - just as for files and processes
holding them opened.  We do have objects for process->file (/proc/<pid>/fd/*)
and we certainly don't have anything like that for other direction.
That's what I'm asking about - do we want to have objects on the _partition_
side of things that would require per-partition directory?  Not on the
filesystem/swap/whatnot side...
