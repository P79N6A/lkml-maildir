I just tried this, and got this:
isapnp: Scanning for Pnp cards...
isapnp: No Plug & Play device found
...
Soundblaster audio driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
sb_card: No ISAPnP cards found, trying standard ones...
When using sb=xxx, it then seems to find it (but not report it), when not
using it, it's followed by:
sb_card: I/O, IRQ, and DMA are mandatory
So, I guess it isn't working for me, or you have something "different"
