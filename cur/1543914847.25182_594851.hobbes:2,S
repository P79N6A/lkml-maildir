Bad.  It's supposed to power off the machine.
Can you please try "echo test > /sys/power/disk" before the hibernation?
After that "echo disk > /sys/power/state" should only "suspend" the box
for several seconds and come back to the command prompt.
If that fails, please try
# echo testproc > /sys/power/disk
# echo disk > /sys/power/state
and see if this returns to the command prompt.
Greetings,
Rafael
