hi,
i just checked some stuff on my server via vnc when suddenly the cpu load went to 100% because of kjournald. i could only reboot my server with sysrq keys, because no shell was working/accepting input.
this is the dmesg output, which also scrolled down very fast on all consoles (not on vnc, but i also looked at the monitor of my server).

i have no idea what could have caused this problem (the same problem, only other blocks, happend 11 days ago) and how i could debug this, since i have nothing else in the log files. when hitting the sysrq key to terminate the processes i got some other messages (which looked like oopses), but they were scrolling down so fast i couldn't read anything. is my OS hard disk (hda) dying (which is not older than 3 months)?
i also got this message on startup:
hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }

i also attached the smartctl -a /dev/hda output, if it helps.
thanks very much for any info,
JG
