This strikes me as absurd.  
It's even more absurd that such a fundamental change in the semantics
of a core kernel primitive was made during the deep code freeze.  
I can probably solve the problem in my own driver by reverting to 
the "obsolete" scsi error handling, but I'm sure there are going to be 
more than a few people with aha1542 adapters that will be pulling their 
hair out when their system freezes after the SCSI target probe. 
Is this a brown-paper-bag bug ?
