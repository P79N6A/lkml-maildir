I also mentioned it would been cleaner if the driver design would be
changed not to use procfs that way. I will back it out as soon as the
driver will stop using it, it's not a change in a monolithic kernel
where it could be forgotten like an -ac or a mainline, it's in a
separate patch called 00_comx-driver-compile-1 so there's no risk to
forget about it.  It cannot hurt anybody to export it until the driver
design is changed to be cleaner, just don't use it in the meantime, if
you use it again in another driver that's your mistake not mine. It is
not a pratical problem (the pratical problem infact happens without the
00_comx-driver-compile-1 patch), it is only a documentation problem and
I think the name of the patch should be clear enough in that sense.
