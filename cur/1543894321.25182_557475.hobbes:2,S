I tried nosmp and this dell 8-way I'm using wouldn't boot...

I'm fairly certain that this is an nbd issue and MD is hanging as a
side-effect of nbd getting wedged.  As far as nbd not working on SMP;
I thought Herbert Xu fixed it in 2.6.16?
Is that to say that his fix was incomplete and/or useless?
Who is the maintainer of the nbd code in the kernel?

Mike
