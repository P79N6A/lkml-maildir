Hi,
I've done some more testing and the drive is now responding to commands 
:-) so we are getting more close. It however still fails to give the 
status back and is busy after the first command. I've included a dmesg, 
updated patch and strace as attachment to the bug report. In the dmesg I 
see a oops I hope that this will help you find the problem. I also had 
an oops at the first try but got lost during the cut and paste work :-( 
sorry for that.
Best regards,
Stef
