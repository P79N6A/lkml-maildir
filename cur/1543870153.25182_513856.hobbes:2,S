I don't see the point in updating the timestamp from these functions.
The file isn't _modified_ by sync() or fsync().  Just as it's not
modified by stat().
sync() and fsync() do cache->disk, while the file itself stays the
same.
OTOH msync(MS_ASYNC) does memory->file, which is a conceptually file
modifying operation.  OK, msync(MS_ASYNC) is actually a no-op on
2.6.18+, but that's purely an implementation detail and no application
should be relying on it.
Before 2.6.18 sync() or fsync() acually didn't flush data written
through a shared mapping to disk, only msync(MS_SYNC), because the
dirty state was only available in the page tables, not in the page or
the inode.
