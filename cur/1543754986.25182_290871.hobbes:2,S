That's another option.  My concern is that if a generic driver pokes
around with hardware, it may fail to initialize properly when the actual
driver is loaded.  There are other problems too.  If the system were to
be suspended while the generic driver was loaded, the restore_state code
may be incorrect, also rendering the device unusable.
I'd like to leave the option of unloading generic driver open.  I just
think we need to be aware of potential problems it might cause, before
deciding to go that direction.
Thanks,
Adam
