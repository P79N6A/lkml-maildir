I can say with confidence that those methods _don't_ work for a project
with 300 directories and 100000 (one hundred thousand) files.  It is
also difficult to convert & maintain a project where the implicit rules
are different between directories.
Recursive make is also bad for incremental builds of such large projects.
Looks like a fine idea for the kernel though, which is relatively small
and simple :-)
