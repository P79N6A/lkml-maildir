The reason now gets smaller than timestamp was because of random thing
that activate_task() do to p->timestamp.  Here are the sequence of events:
On timer tick, scheduler_tick() updates rq->timestamp_last_tick,
1 us later, process A wakes up, entering into run queue. activate_task()
updates p->timestamp.  At this time p->timestamp is larger than rq->
timestamp_last_tick.  Then another cpu goes into idle, tries load balancing,
It wrongly finds process A not cache hot (because of integer underflow),
moved it.  Then application runs on a cache cold CPU and suffer performance.
