If the kernel doesn't solve it "entirely", then it is better
off without the kernel bloat.  In fact vendors would distribute
their own user-space application(s) to provide a consistent and
complete solution(s) of their product(s) to their customer(s).
This could also be achieved via "sg_ses", which can also
control custom vendor pages if the encodings are known by the
customer (which they would be if they purchased the product).

You shouldn't insist on this.  It should already be clear
to you this direction isn't the vendor's preference.

Vendors do use "temperature, power and fan speeds" and
in fact more features, some of them completely custom
for their product, since they end up writing the SES
device server of the enclosure themselves (for their product).
This kind of control and representation is better left to
user-space.  The kernel neither needs to represent it
nor know about it, since it is itself not using nor
controlling it.

This statement (above) really means that the numbers below
are but merely the speculation of one person.

90% doesn't make it a necessary requirement for the kernel
to have this, as well as the fact that the kernel is neither
needing this to function properly, nor using it.

"should there be more ... I don't think so"
This decision isn't yours to make.  In fact such a decision is never
made by one person only.  This decision is made by 1) the industry,
2) the customers and 3) vendors by the pricing of their product(s).
