It is possible, but the function has to take an unsigned long.
But I share your dislike of this.  Here's my final version, but it's still
ugly.
Rusty.

Attempt to create callbacks which take unsigned long as well as
correct pointer types.

+ * typesafe_fn_and_arg - cast function type and arg if compatible
+ * @fn: the function or function pointer
+ * @arg: the function argument.
+ * @ulongtype: the function pointer type if arg is an integer

+ * unsigned long.

+ * Typechecking is done by the caller when they assign or pass these

+ * long and @arg is compatible with that, and also the case where @fn
+ * and @arg match types.  For other cases, @fn is not cast, so using
+ * the results of this macro should cause a warning unless @fn is
+ * already of if type @voidtype.
