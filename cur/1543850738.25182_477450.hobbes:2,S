While I fixed this quite some time ago (after running into it myself), it
obviously still is a problem with older versions. However, using as' -Z
option seems to help here.
On the other hand, I long wanted to compose a patch to do away
with all the .tmp_* things at the build root, and move them into a
single .tmp/ directory - this would also seem to make a nice place to
put all sort of other temporary files in... I just never found the time
to actually do that, sorry.
