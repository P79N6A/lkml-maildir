Relevant iomem entries are:
f0000000-f7ffffff : PCI Bus #40
 f0000000-f7ffffff : 0000:40:00.0
   f0000000-f7ffffff : vesafb
f8000000-f9ffffff : PCI Bus #40
 f8000000-f8ffffff : 0000:40:00.0
 f9000000-f9ffffff : 0000:40:00.0
After I load nvidia.ko, it changes to:
f0000000-f7ffffff : PCI Bus #40
 f0000000-f7ffffff : 0000:40:00.0
   f0000000-f7ffffff : vesafb

X is working fine. KDE runs, glxgears reports 890fps on full screen (1280x1024)
I usually boot with 'quiet' option, so this error is very evident. I
personally can live with it, but I'll surely get a bunch of mail from
my users reporting the "problem". I hope it will be fixed new next
releases.
Anyway. Thanks a lot for your help guys!
