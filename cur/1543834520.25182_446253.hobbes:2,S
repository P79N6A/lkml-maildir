Subject: vxfs_readdir locking incorrect: add lock_kernel() or remove unlock_kernel()?

Commit 7b2fd697427e73c81d5fa659efd91bd07d303b0e in the historical GIT
tree stopped calling the readdir member of a file_operations struct with
the big kernel lock held, and fixed up all the readdir functions to do
their own locking.  However, that change added calls to unlock_kernel()
in vxfs_readdir (fs/freevxfs/vxfs_lookup.c), but no call to
lock_kernel().  Should vxfs_readdir call lock_kernel(), or should the
calls to unlock_kernel() go away?
