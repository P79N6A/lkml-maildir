"640k will be enough for anyone" ?
No. Unfortunately, userspace programs grow in size as fast
as your RAM. Because typically developers do not think
about size of their program until it starts to outgrow
their RAM.
Today, 128M RAM swapless is barely enough to run full
spectrum of apps. OpenOffice and Mozilla "lead" the pack,
followed by KDE/Gnome etc.
