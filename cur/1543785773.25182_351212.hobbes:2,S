Yes it does.  They are the leaf nodes in the tree.  They will also have
a "dev" file in them, which is the only real way to determine this for
stuff like udev and HAL.
I didn't show all the symlinks and files as I was trying to make the
directory structure the main point.  I can fill them in if you are
curious.

Yeah, you can.  But you don't have a place for the "drivers" of those
interfaces, which is something you will probably need (I think video
needs them)

No, I still don't think we need that.

Well, whatever solution we come up with, has to work for block, input,
and video at the least, or it's not acceptable.
Ok, I'll go off and try to code this all up to see if it's even
possible, on my plane ride.  More from me next Tuesday...
