I will do that for sure, but preliminary investigation shows that
this behaviour does not show with 2.6.7 and earlier, but appears for sure in
2.6.7-bk13 (Haven't tried earlier bk snapshots)

It is probable, but here: only 2.6.7+ machines behave like this.
I also noticed, that turning tcp_window_scaling off does not always
fix the problem, turning tcp_bic to 0 too helps even more.
