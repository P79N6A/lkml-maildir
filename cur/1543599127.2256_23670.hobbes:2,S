Folks.  I'm sorry to disturb you but I need your help.
I've just installed the Red Hat 7.1 distribution on to a IBM Thinkpad
765D
and I am receiving the message:
  PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:02.0 Please try
using pci=biosirq
  PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin B of device 00:02.1 Please try
using pci=biosirq
  Yenta IRQ list 0eb8, PCI irq0
  Socket status: 30000020
  Yenta IRQ list 0eb8, PCI irq0
  Socket status: 30000006
  
The PCMCIA controller is the TI chipset.  I've done a search on google
and have found 
numerous queries with similar reports, but no solutions.  I'm sure there
is a config
file which allows IRQ values to be set.  There is no mechanism that I
can see in the
Thinkpad configuration to allow the setting of a fixed IRQ for the
PCMCIA devices.
Clearly IRQ0 can't possibly work.  I believe OS/2 and various microsoft
operating 
systems use IRQ9 with the PCMCIA controllers.  
If someone can point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.
Thanks in advance.
