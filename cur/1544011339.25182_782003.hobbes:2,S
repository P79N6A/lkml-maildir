I haven't tested kmemleak so I'm just commenting on the code. I was
thinking about false negatives, not false positives.

I think we're talking about two different things here. Don't we then
have false negatives because we reach ->freelist of struct
kmem_cache_cpu which contains a pointer to an object that is free'd
(take a look at slab_free() fast-path)?
