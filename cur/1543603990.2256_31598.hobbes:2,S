Fair enough. ;)

Thanks for the concise explanation. I follow you a little better now.

I have to agree. If the job is I/O bound, it's unlikely to need the
extra CPU time.

Ok, I think I get you. I didn't realize that there was already a strict
fairness enforcing mechanism built into the scheduler. So, you're
proposing to do a rebalance when the first CPU runs out of things to do,
which will happen sometime before the recalculate period expires?
Sounds reasonable, but I think you will see a flurry of rebalancing when
the recalculate period is ending and the CPUs are starting to run out of
things to do. This will cause load the balancer to frantically try to
spread the last few tasks with remaining time slices across the CPUs.
This is exactly the kind of thrashing that we would like to avoid.
