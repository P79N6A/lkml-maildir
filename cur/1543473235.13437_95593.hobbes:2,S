   The problem is that the reporting is confused -- the MB number is
   bytes / 2^20, but the GB number is MB / 10.  Either the MB number
   should be changed to bytes / 10^6, or the GB number should be
   changed to MB / 2^10.
I'd be tempted to keep the GB entry as refering to 2^30 bytes, and
replace the MB entry with Mi.B. (i.e. millions of bytes, which seems
to be what manufacturers use).  That way, we can keep both camps
happy, and (more important) stop future users from asking why Linux
doesn't recognise the full capacity of their drives.
So, we'd get 
SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 17916240 [9173 Mi.B] [8.5 GB]
(And if people ask why the difference, then the 9173 is "marketing
megabytes",  and the 8.5Gb is the "real figure".)
This change would be required in (at least) 
  drivers/scsi/sd.c
  drivers/block/hd.c
  drivers/block/ide.c
Just a thought....
