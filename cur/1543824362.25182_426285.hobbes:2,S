Is it possible to process memory before cpu in container hot-add code?

Dont you need all per-cpu allocated on that node? Or is it from node0 or 
something for all hotpluggable cpus?
If node is online first, then all allocations come from that node, thought you
*want* to ensure node/mem is online before cpu is up to get that benefit.
