	Said library is *not* (per standard sources) linked with
	the kernel.  (At L-F-S work I am happy that it is *not*
	linked in per default.)

	That theory works only if you use non-standard image linking.
	A comparison of produced binary object files when compiled
	at the i686 vs. at the i486 would be most educative.
	Which change, and in which manner.  I presume the configuration
	is identical in both cases ?  What does command
		egrep CONFIG_X86 .config
	tell ?
