I knew that, but quite frankly, I don't have the guts to configure
with --prefix=/usr.   I doubt many people have.  I rather let my 
packaging system control what's in /usr.
After all, what are distributions and packaging systems for?

I was talking about the test that wrote 8,192 x 1 byte sequentially.
This test works now that amd doesn't mount with wsize=1k anymore.
Apparently, in order for the write behind code to become effective,
you have to mount at least with a wsize >= 4k.
So from that perspective, there doesn't seem to appear a reason to
change the default wsize from 4k to 8k.
However, the default wsize may be an issue for large files.
I reported that FreeBSD 3.0 takes 6 seconds to write a 12 MB
file where Linux 2.2.3 with wsize=4k takes 14 seconds.
(Btw, FreeBSD 2.2.8 takes only 2.5 seconds for the same file.)
So I tested the Linux client with wsize=8k; it is still a lot slower.
A Linux 2.2.3 client with wsize=8k takes about 30 seconds to write
a 12 MB file (this is with a different server), while a BSD client takes
about 18 seconds with the same server.
I assume this is what Alan is talking about that will be fixed next.

Call me dumb, but wouldn't I be better off hacking amd instead of hacking
the kernel?
Also, wouldn't it be *really* nice to have a feature in am-utils to 
override *both* the wsize setting given in a NIS map *and* the default 
setting as given by a particular Linux kernel?
I assume that the Linux kernel honors wsize requests that are not the
default.  (fs/nfs/inode.c: nfs_block_size seems to suggest that it does.)
