If they intercept netdev->hard_start_xmit there is nothing
to fix. Or inode->i_ops or any other virtual method pointer
that is called often..
Putting i_ops into const memory doesn't help either -- they
can just copy them and use their own and replace the pointer
in any accessed inode.
It's also not that doing this is rocket science. Anybody
barely skilled in computer architecture should be able
to figure this out.
Ok the only thing that could help is IA64/PPC64 style smart pointer
checking that could prevent foreign code from being 
executed, but you won't get that on x86 or most other
architectures any time soon.
And that would also only work if you disable module loading
or implement a likely impractical/incompatible
with free software code signing scheme
(and Vista has just shown that these don't work anyways)

Well, it might at best buy you a few weeks/months in
terms of the exploit arms race, but thrash your user's TLBs
forever.
