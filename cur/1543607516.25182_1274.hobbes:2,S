Ouch, we've forgotten one important thing. Due to frequency deviation
of the reference generator actual clock speed, say, 599.8 MHz of the
600 MHz CPU would be perfectly valid. However, validate_cc_value()
would fail in this case for no reason.
The 10 MHz is more than enough to cover this.
Patch applies on the top of Richard's one.
Ivan.
