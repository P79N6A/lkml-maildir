I was completly aware of the problem you pointed out (and I showed you the
_good_ scenario, I know the current scenario is racy). The only thing is
that in real world the race can't trigger and that's why there wasn't the
check for null.
Maybe you changed something that will cause the race to trigger and so
probably you want to add some null-check before the wakeup calls.
