Fair enough. The kernel may not be the appropriate place for providing
such an emulation, but there's no reason why glibc shouldn't be able
to do so for the case where sendfile returns EINVAL.
However none of this changes the matter of the NFS client. The latter
*does* support a pagecache, and so the one-line patch is appropriate.
