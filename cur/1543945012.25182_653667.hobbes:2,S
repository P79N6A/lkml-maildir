Yes, and the tester reported, a breakage. We are on it.
Apparently, you cannot do a full deallocation of resources
at reboot notifier, nor would you want to I guess.
But you can do the flush. The exit call is never called
on a reboot and the card access is valid to the end.
Please comment?
So I pretty much reverted that patch, but did leave some
cleanups.
Also we found the other problems reported with user-mode tools
and cat /proc/sys/gdth/0
so 2 patches on the way above reverted. Give us a few ours to test
every thing.
Thanks
