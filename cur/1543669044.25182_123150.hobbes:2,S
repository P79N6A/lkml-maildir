Well, all we really want is a way to set emul_prefix.  Which I could
do with a PPC-specific syscall if I had to, I guess.  Doing it in
userspace is possible but ugly, because you have to handle several
different syscalls, plus keep track of the current directory, plus
handle symlinks, etc., etc., in the emulator.  The kernel has all that
information readily to hand plus the data structures to keep track of
it all.

Oh.  Ah.  I didn't realize it was a subsystem with a maintainer.
