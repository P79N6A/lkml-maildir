     You're suffering, I'm afraid, from an almost pathological lack of
     imagination.   I'm pointing out kerneld/kmod/whatever as an example
     of punting kernel events out to userspace for a daemon to deal
     with, not saying "we should do it exactly like kerneld, or kmod,
     or whatever the fuck the interface is this week"
                   ____
     david parsons \bi/ Just what IS the interface this week, anyway?
