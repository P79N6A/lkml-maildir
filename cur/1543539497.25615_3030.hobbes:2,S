Yes if its just meant to avoid random accidents then we definitely need
the patch. But even better the IDE drive manufactor should fix this in the
drive firmware.
By the way an ignorant root will much more easily do an rm -rf / and
forget to do back ups, which would lead to much more expensive damages
than a cheap IDE drive, in term of loss of time and data.
The stupid things a stupid root could do are countless i think. 
If the point of Andre is fixing the driver because its broken and allows
illegal operations then its completely right for this patch to get into
the kernel, IMHO.
