i'm sorry, but where did you "correct this statement already"? You 
havent replied to your mail to correct it explicitly, and there's no 
later statement of yours that says anything near to "let me correct this 
via X" or "i was wrong here, i meant Y".
the only subsequent reference of yours seems to be:
| I'm not saying we should "fake" anything .. I'm saying list what's 
| really happening .. In a human readable way .
what you write here does not read as a 'correction', this disputes my 
characterisation, suggesting that your original point is still intact. 
How should i have known that you meant this to be a 'correction' of your 
original point, and that this (whatever it means precisely) replaces it?
if you concede a point or correct a statement then /please/ make it 
clear. There's nothing bad about being wrong or being stupid 
occasionally, it happens to all of us.

it's not a request_irq() but a setup_irq().
dropping the IRQ#0 line would be fatally wrong: /proc/interrupt lists 
all active interrupt lines. There can (and often is) a count in IRQ#0. 
Why should it be hidden?
furthermore, as i pointed it out earlier: what you suggest is bad for 
compatibility: removing/changing the non-count portions of the LOC or 
the IRQ#0 entry /will/ break scripts.
