I am still waiting for a single byte of source code for Linux showing
up on your 
ftp://207.109.151.240
. You talk and talk. Where is the
code?
If you're so generous in mailing around the source, then I'd really
like to take a look at your stuff, I'm in the process of designing a
multi-TB server farm and so far I will either go with NetApp or a
really stable Linux solution.  Reiserfs/LVM seemed to be nice but the
LVM has constraints at 256GB.
Where is the code you're always talking about?
>-- you ignored them.  I'll post the source code and you can look it over
Please, _do_ it.
	Regards
		Henning
