The "cb must be in virgin state" rule is indeed news to me. But
maybe the rule has always been there, and nobody really noticed :-)

I'm not sure this is the problem: as far as I remember, the ATM stack
doesn't assume that other layers leave skb->cb intact. In fact, it
shouldn't even touch an skb once it has been passed on.
BTW, I'm happy that ATM finally has a maintainer again. Thanks, Chas !
