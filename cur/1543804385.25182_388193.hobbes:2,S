Our low-level driver is not IB, doesn't implement IB, and doesn't care
about IB.  Our upper-level driver implements IB, and interfaces to the
existing IB tree.

We implement IB verbs just fine, both in the kernel and userspace.

I have no issue with it.  We already act as a provider to it, in our
higher-layer driver code.
We have some user page pinning code that is clearly similar in purpose,
and that I want to refactor in a helpful way.
We have UD and RC protocol engines that could profitably be moved out of
our driver and into the IB layer at some future point in time, should
some other device ever come along that could use them.

Our hardware actually does no offload whatsoever.  That's why we are (a)
fast (b) flexible and (c) somewhat big and unusual compared to other IB
drivers.
