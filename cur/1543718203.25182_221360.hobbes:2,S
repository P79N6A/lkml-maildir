Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

First of a batch of seven rmap patches, based on 2.6.6-mm3.  Probably
the final batch: remaining issues outstanding can have isolated patches.
The first half of the batch is good for anonmm or anon_vma, the second
half of the batch replaces my anonmm rmap by Andrea's anon_vma rmap.
Judge for yourselves which you prefer.  I do think I was wrong to call
anon_vma more complex than anonmm (its lists are easier to understand
than my refcounting), and I'm happy with its vma merging after the last
patch.  It just comes down to whether we can spare the extra 24 bytes
(maximum, on 32-bit) per vma for its advantages in swapout and mremap.
rmap 34 vm_flags page_table_lock
Why do we guard vm_flags mods with page_table_lock when it's already
down_write guarded by mmap_sem?  There's probably a historical reason,
but no sign of any need for it now.  Andrea added a comment and removed
the instance from mprotect.c, Hugh plagiarized his comment and removed
the instances from madvise.c and mlock.c.  Huge leap in scalability...
not expected; but this should stop people asking why those spinlocks.
