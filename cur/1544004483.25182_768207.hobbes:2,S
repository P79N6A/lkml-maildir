i've queued up the fix below in tip/sched/urgent - Maciej, could you 
please test it? I've build and boot tested it.
I picked the simplest solution - to widen the (init only) use of the 
rq lock there, which is irqsafe already.
Another question is: how/where does the hibernation code call 
init_idle() with interrupts and preemption enabled? All the normal 
init_idle() sequences are called with irqs off (and at least with 
preemption off), that's why my testing didnt catch this bug.
[ I was under the distinct illusion that i had all callers covered 
  both via review and via testing (there's no that many users of naked 
  sched_clock() left). So there was certainly no bug known to me - my 
  comment was directed at out-of-tree naked-sched_clock() users which 
  do exist. The recommended in-kernel API is cpu_clock(cpu) - except
  for scheduler-internal use which was the issue here. ]
But it was still a late change and the boot warning was unnecessary, 
sorry about that.
	Ingo

Which, as noted by Linus, was caused by me, via:
  7cbaef9c "sched: optimize sched_clock() a bit"
Move the rq locking a bit earlier in the initialization sequence,
that will make the sched_clock() call in init_idle() non-preemptible.
