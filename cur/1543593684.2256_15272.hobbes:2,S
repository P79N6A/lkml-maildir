Hi,
It's not a bug, it's willful.

To make a custom kernel where you can use non-local addresses more freely,
find source address checks in ip_route_output_slow() and get rid of all of
them except considering
	MULTICAST(saddr) || BADCLASS(saddr) || ZERONET(saddr) ||
		saddr == htonl(INADDR_BROADCAST)
as invalid.
