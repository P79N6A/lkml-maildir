This could help (tm) :-)

at least I could do some pretty dirty things to the poor chip and it still
seems to recover after this patch.
rmmod still has some problems, occasionally I get a "usage count 2" thing
(currently running the rawhide 2.4.22-1.2061.nptl, I've seen similar with
2.6.0-test5ish too, I suspect ipv6 might be involved, but sometimes I can rmmod
it even with ipv6 loaded so it's a bit random).
