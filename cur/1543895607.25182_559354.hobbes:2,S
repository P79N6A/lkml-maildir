The main difference appears to be the potential size.  Both extended
attributes and forks allow for extra data that I neither want or need.
But once the extra space is large enough to hide a rootkit in, it
becomes a security problem instead of just something pointless.
Pointless here means that _I_ don't see the point.  Maybe there are
valid uses for extended attributes.  If there are, noone has explained
them to me yet.
