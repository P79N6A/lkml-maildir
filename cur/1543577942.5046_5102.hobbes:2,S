The only solution I see is something like a "active_immobile" list, and
add entries to that list whenever "writepage()" returns 1 - instead of
just moving them to the active list.
Seems to be a simple enough change. The main worry would be getting the
pages _off_ such a list: anything that unlocks a shared memory segment
(can you even do that? If the only way to unlock is to remove, we have no
problems) would have to have a special function to move all pages from the
immobile list back to the active list (and then they'd get moved back if
they were for another segment that is still locked).
