Andrew, 
   I am building the env to test.
   The patch was my original idea, but I was afraid of breaking any code
that rely on the OLD wrong cond_sched semantic. However later I did a
grep found that there is very few code that checks the return value of
cond_resched. So the patch should be safe. 
However I think cond_resched_lock and cond_resched_softirq also need fix
to make the semantic consistent.
Please check the following patch.
