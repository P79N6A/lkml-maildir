Hi all,
            I am using IBM ISA turbo 16/4 tokenring adapter. This is what I
experienced in 2.4.0 kernel. On configuring the adapter using Lanaid tool ,
the default ROM address always falls within the video ROM area.. This was
causing the system to hang-up when XWindows was started and there was no
other way than to switch off the system and switch on again.  So I changed
the ROM area of the adapter using the Lanaid tool  which fall outside the
video ROM area.   Now I have no problem in using the XWindows. The default
interrupt is 3.  Have any one experienced this sort of problem
Thanks & Regards
Shiju
