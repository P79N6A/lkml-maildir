Subject: 50MB kernel on ia64??
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

folx,
i've recently been trying to compile kernels on ia64 platform.  i've
resolved some compiler problems (thanks to help here and from redhat) but
now i've got another problem:  kernels built with the attached .config (or
anything even vaguely similar--this one is for 2.4.7) are around 50MB in
size!  morevover, there's no vmlinux or bzImage target in the makefile
once ia64 is selected as the architecture.  i've been having problems
getting the compiled kernels to boot, but i'm not sure if size is part of
the reason.
is there anything wrong with a kernel that big, or is that what i should
expect on ia64?
thanks,
