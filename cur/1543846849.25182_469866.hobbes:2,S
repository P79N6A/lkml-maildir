Just posted rc2 to alsa-devel, see also at the end of mail.

Maybe there are other usecases for this. Then it'd be easier to move.

struct list_head?
I thought we'd use one pointer less this way.
If there are benefits that outweight one pointer more per instance,
I'll use standard list.

Ah ok.

this looks better in rc2, I hope.

rc2:
-------------------------------------------------------------
snd_disconnected_file, virtual device
On response to "usb disconnect" an usb-soundcard manipulates
that snd_card's file's f_ops to only allow release
by calling this virtual device's 
   void snd_disconnect_file(struct file *file).
After release is actually called, the virtual device instance is freeed.
