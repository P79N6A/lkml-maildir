I was trying to compile and run a new kernel on my firewall.  Kernel 2.0.30
runs fine.  with the same compiler kernel version 2.0.37 fails on boot.
lilo notes loading the kernel.....
uncompressing the kernel....
and then immediately reboots.
any suggestions or help would be appreciated.
BTW, it uncompresses 2.0.30 just fine. and I tried both zImage and bzImage
