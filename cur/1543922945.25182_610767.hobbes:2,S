True.   We can probably get away with an implicit flush when 
CAP_SYS_RAWIO is set, but that's pretty gross :(

A little of both ;)
We could introduce a new API, though either way, the same fundamental 
problems apply wrt auditing.
I see three reasons that new APIs are warranted:
a) to deal with block numbers > 2^31 --> FIBMAP64
b) to have a path where no syncing is required due to worries about user 
DoS (delayed allocation / data in journal).
c) possibly some way to FIBMAP a range so that userspace doesn't need to 
syscall for each block, something like how mincore() does it?
I have a patchset ready that I'll send out shortly that introduces 
FIBMAP64.  The last patch in that set drops the CAP_SYS_RAWIO, but it's 
probably not what we want given DoS case.  I'd like to send it out 
anyway to get some comments on some of the sanity checks and locking I'm 
adding.
Handling (c) above is just extra sugar and isn't something I'm too 
worried about implementing.
