I believe the application is _first_ who will get ENOMEM. It must be
terrible luck that it would ask exactly for the size of remaining free
memory. Most probably, it will ask for less or more. "Less" in not
a problem in this case, so consider it asks for more. Then, OOM killer
might well expect the application asking for memory is most probably
exactly the application which caused the trouble.

I'd go for it at least nowadays.

Do you think login or sshd will ever use flag "yes, I'm a candidate"?
I think exactly same bahaviour we get right now with those hard coded decisions
you mention above. Otherwise the hard coded decision is programmed into
every sshd, init instance anyway. I think it's not necessary to put
login and shells on thsi ban list, user will re-login again. ;)

Yes, it doesn't kill parent bash. I don't understand the _doubled_ output
in syslog, but maybe you do. Is that related to hyperthreading? ;)
