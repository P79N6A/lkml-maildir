Subject: [PATCH] highest_possible_processor_id() has to be a macro
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/15/112

	... otherwise, things like alpha and sparc64 break and break
badly.  They define cpu_possible_map to something else in smp.h
*AFTER* having included cpumask.h.
	If that puppy is a macro, expansion will happen at the actual
caller, when we'd already seen #define cpu_possible_map ... and we will
get the right thing used.
	As an inline helper it will be tokenized before we get to that
define and that's it; no matter what we define later, it won't affect
anything.  We get modules with dependency on cpu_possible_map instead
of the right symbol (phys_cpu_present_map in case of sparc64), or outright
link errors if they are built-in.
