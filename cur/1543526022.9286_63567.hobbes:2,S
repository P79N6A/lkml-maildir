This stuff is really the job of the BIOS rather than the operating system.
This device should only be used if the BIOS is old/substandard.  By the
time the OS has booted, you have done way too much work already.

Far too short for such a hardware-specific device.  Also, minor 180 is
taken.  I suggest /dev/microcode actually.  It's quite self-explanatory,
and can be used for other CPUs with microcode updates as well.
Major 10, minor 184.
