It appears the current ReiserFS code over at 
http://devlinux.com/namesys/
 has
reached the point of stability and I was curious if there were any plans to
integrate it into the standard kernel.
ReiserFS seems like the perfect filesystem to store news and squid caches as
they all contain large numbers of small files which get deleted often.
Just curious,
Jordan
