Subject: [PATHC] remove a redundant variable in sys_prctl()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's a re-send of a small patch I sent on Aug. 9.
The patch removes a redundant variable `sig' from sys_prctl().
For some reason, when sys_prctl is called with option == PR_SET_PDEATHSIG
then the value of arg2 is assigned to an int variable named sig. Then sig
is tested with valid_signal() and later used to set the value of 
current->pdeath_signal . 
There is no reason to use this intermediate variable since valid_signal() 
takes a unsigned long argument, so it can handle being passed arg2 directly, 
and if the call to valid_signal is OK, then we know the value of arg2 is in 
the range  zero to _NSIG and thus it'll easily fit in a plain int and thus 
there's no problem assigning it later to current->pdeath_signal (which is 
an int).
The patch gets rid of the pointless variable `sig'.
This reduces the size of kernel/sys.o in 2.6.13-rc6-mm1 by 32 bytes on my 
system.
Patch has been compile tested, boot tested, and just to make damn sure I 
didn't break anything I wrote a quick test app that calls 
prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG ...) with the entire range of values for a 
unsigned long, and it behaves as expected with and without the patch.
