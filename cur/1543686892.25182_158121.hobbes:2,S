Plus AIO link(), unlink(), rename(), open() (especially open),
msync(), mlock(), mmap(), sendfile(), readdir(), readlink(), ioctl()
and a few more.
These are too complicated to re-implement using explicit state
machines in the kernel.  That would require rewriting huge amounts of
code in all the individual filesystems.  You could never really trust
all the blocking corner cases were removed - fetching metadata,
reading directory blocks, allocating memory etc.
That's why the kernel would implement AIO stat() et al. by creating a
set of task contexts to handle queue of these requests.
Even that's at least as complicated as doing it in userspace.
Also with current AIO interface there will always be operations things
that it doesn't support, while the scheduler method works with
anything that blocks, including VM paging.
That said, a generalised "async syscall" interface would be very nice.
It could automatically dispatch things which AIO supports using AIO,
and everything else using task contexts.
