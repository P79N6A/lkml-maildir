Subject: Bad pty handling 2.1.1 (was: Oops in kNFS code (vanilla 2.1.1) (?))

Seems like there's a problem with ptys.
I'm trying to run the egcs testsuite in two egcs trees (a patched one
and an original one) in parallel in a two-CPU SMP box. 
Everytime it ended up crashing the machine.
When the test suites are running I get bunches of "Warning: dev
(03:07) tty->count(0) != #fd's(2) in do_tty_hangup" (with varying
figures for device and numbers).
Everytime (3 times so far) it ended up crashing in [schedule+210/864]
like the enclosed oops. Once when called from xprt_receive(enclosed
Oops), once from interruptible_sleep_on (oops available) and once from
sys_select (oops available too).
The kernel I use is NOT compiled with Unix98 PTY support.
I'm trying to have a quicker and easier way to reproduce it (probably
with several processes racing to grab PTY's).
I'm using vanilla 2.1.1 (config available upon request)
Phil.
