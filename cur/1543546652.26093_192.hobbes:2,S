Hi Tigran!

It seems the problem has nothing to do with DEC21150 -- it's just a collision
between a bus number assigned by us to CardBus and the same one assigned by
the BIOS to a PCI bridge (in this case, a 21150).
Please try this patch, it should help (it modifies the bus scan to work
in two passes and assign new numbers after all already assigned ones are
known).
				Have a nice fortnight
