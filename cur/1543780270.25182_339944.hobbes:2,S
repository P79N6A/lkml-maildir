Wow, Google has really declined in quality.  I got zero hits for
"Linksys WUSB 54G linux".  Then I found this page on my own.
(from 
http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List
)
Card: Linksys #[WUSB54G], 802.11b/g, USB 2.0 -- [link here|List#WUSB54G] 
      * Chipset: Prism54
      * usbid: 5041:2234
      * Driver: Linksys Windows XP driver
        
http://www.linksys.com/download/default.asp
      * Other: Works smoothly, of course ;) - this is the device the USB
        extension was originally developed for. WEP is running, WPA is
        supported using wpa_supplicant 0.2.5. No problems with both 1.1
        and 2.0 host controllers. As with many other USB devices, no
        success with 2.4 kernels so far. Try to use 2.6.7 or better.
        There is a native driver for Prism54 that is working on USB
        support. View its status at Prism54.org
Sorry for the WOB.  And if anyone from Google is reading, WTF?
